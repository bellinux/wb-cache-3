50|$|Tetraethyl {{pyrophosphate}} is a {{very toxic}} <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>ester.</b> In its pure form it is a colourless, hygroscopic liquid. It is fully miscible with water and various types of organic solvents, except for petroleum based solvents. The liquid evaporates very slowly and hydrolyses very rapidly in water. Because the mechanism for the hydrolysis is first order, the half-lifes were determined to be 7.5 hours at 25 °C and 3.1 hours at 40 °C when dissolved in distilled water. If one heats TEPP it will start to decompose at around 150-200 °C, which produces ethylene gas. Furthermore, acidic fumes of phosphoric acid and carbon monoxide could be formed. At lower temperatures TEPP could form triethylphosphate and ethyl metaphosphates, which are acid catalysed reactions.|$|E

Energy-resolved collision-activated dissociation experiments allow the dissociation of the molecular ions of these compounds in such a manner that only a few fragment ions dominate the spectrum. An abundant fragment ion of m/z 109, formed from all of the compounds studied, can have at least four different stable structures: (CH 3 O) 2 PO+, CH 3 CH 2 OP(O) OH+, CH 2 =CHOP(H) (OH) 2 +, and (CH 2 O) 2 P(H) OH+. The structure of the fragment ion of m/z 109 was found to reflect the phosphorus-containing part of the compounds studied. Another abundant fragment ion obtained for all the aryl esters studied is structurally characteristic of the aromatic moiety of the molecule.

40|$|Disulfoton (O,O, diethyl S- 2 -(ethylthio) ethyl phosphorodithioate) {{and other}} <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>ester</b> {{compounds}} are insecticides which inhibit acetylcholinesterase. Chemicals of this class cause signs of toxicity in mammals which are referable to acculmulation of acetylcholine at neuroeffector sites. A tolerance to this toxic action can be induced in experimental animals by giving multiple, sublethal {{doses of the}} compounds. There is strong evidence that disulfoton tolerance occurs because of {{a reduction in the}} sensitivity of tissues in the affected animals to acetylcholine. ^ Experiments were designed to test the possibility that a {{decrease in the number of}} muscarinic cholinergic receptors could be downmodulating the sensitivity of tissues to acetylcholine. It was found that, concomitant with the onset of disulfoton tolerance, there was a decrease relative to control values in the specific binding of (2 ̆ 73) H quinuclidinyl benzilate ((2 ̆ 73) HQNB, a compound which selectively labels muscarinic cholinergic receptors) to homogenates of rat brain and ileal muscle. The decrease in (2 ̆ 73) HQNB binding was due to a reduction in the density of muscarinic receptors. There was, however, no alteration in the binding of (2 ̆ 73) H QNB, or the muscarinic agonists (2 ̆ 73) H oxotremorine-M and oxotremorine to atria from disulfoton-tolerant rats. The possibility that cardiac tissue was not subsensitive to cholinergic agonists was ruled out in experiments testing the effect of the muscarinic agonist carbachol on heart rate in vivo, and the negative chronotropic effect of oxotremorine on atria from disulfoton-tolerant rats: a clear reduction in the sensitivity to cholinergic agonists was seen in each case. It was, therefore concluded that the specificity and temporal correlation of (2 ̆ 73) HQNB binding decreases suggested that the loss of muscarinic receptors might play a role in modulating the sensitivity of several tissues to acetylcholine, but that other mechanisms also contribute to the tolerance phenomenon. ^ Other experiments revealed that disulfoton tolerance, as measured by resistance to the lethal effects of carbachol, could be induced by feeding rats low levels of the <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>ester</b> in the diet. The concentration of disulfoton used inhibited acetylcholinesterase, but not to the extent that overt signs of toxicity were observed. These results suggested that tolerance to <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>ester</b> insecticides could be induced in rodents with a dosing scheme which more closely modeled the sort of low level exposures which would be expected in humans environmentally or occupationally in contact with these compounds. ...|$|E

Mice with 0, 50, or 100 % AChE activity were treated subcutaneously with the nerve agent VX. The LD 50 for VX was 10 to 12 µg/kg in AChE-/-, 17 µg/kg in AChE+/-, and 24 µg/kg in AChE+/- mice. The same cholinergic signs of toxicity were present in AChE-/- mice as in wild-type mice, even though AChE-/- mice have no AChE whose inhibition could lead to cholinergic signs. Wild-type mice, but not AChE-/- mice, were protected by pretreatment with atropine. Tissues were extracted from VX-treated and untreated animals and tested for AChE, BChE, and acylpeptide hydrolase activity. VX treatment inhibited 50 % of the AChE activity in brain and muscle of AChE+/+ and +/- mice, 50 % of the BChE activity in all three AChE genotypes, but did not significantly inhibit acylpeptide hydrolase activity.

The addition of the second gate allows selection of individual ion mobility peaks for m/z analysis in the ITMS. This was demonstrated with the <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>ester</b> ions (CWA nerve gas simulants). The ITMS was used to perform isolation and fragmentation of the CWA simulants ions produced in the IMS. For the organophosphates dimethyl methylphosphonate, diethyl methylphosphonate and diisopropyl methylphosphonate, two ion mobility peaks were observed, which are shown to be the ammoniated monomer and ammoniated dimer ions. Using an ElectroSpray Ionisation (ESI) - ITMS, the fragmentation pathway of dimethyl ethylphosphonate (DMEP) is investigated. The isotopomers of DMEP have unusual fragmentations, and density functional theory calculations are used to aid in the interpretation of the mechanisms involved in these fragmentations. Of note, it is shown that entropy must be taken into consideration, and hence the free energy of the final transition involved in the mechanism, so that the true rate-limiting steps can be determined. Preliminary fragmentations using ESI-ITMS of eighteen other organophosphorus esters have been undertaken.

40|$|Non-enzymatic protein glycation is {{a source}} of {{metabolic}} stress that contributes to cytotoxicity and tissue damage. Hyperglycemia has been linked to elevation of advanced glycation endproducts, which mediate much of the vascular pathology leading to diabetic complications. Enhanced glycation of immunoglobulins and their accelerated vascular clearance is proposed as a natural mechanism to intercept alternative advanced glycation endproducts, thereby mitigating microvascular disease. We reported that antibodies against the glycoprotein KLH have elevated reactivity for glycopeptides from diabetic serum. These reactions are mediated by covalent binding between antibody light chains and carbonyl groups of glycated peptides. Diabetic animals that were immunized to induce reactive antibodies had attenuated diabetic nephropathy, which correlated with reduced levels of circulating and kidney-bound glycation products. Molecular analysis of antibody glycation revealed the preferential modification of light chains bearing germline-encoded lambda V regions. We previously noted that antibody fragments carrying V regions in the germline configuration are selected from a human Fv library by covalent binding to a reactive <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>ester.</b> These Fv fragments were specifically modified at light chain V region residues, which map to the combining site at the interface between light and heavy chains.

Paraoxon modulated the genotoxic potency of dietaiy heterocyclic amines in human cells. The results of this study raise the concern of the environmental effects of <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>ester</b> insecticides.

There were statistically significant increases in DNA damage and forward mutation with all three mutagens.

NTE comprises about 0. 03 % of the total protein in brain microsomal fractions and has resisted purification attempts over many years. S 9 B is a potent progressive inhibitor of NTE esteratic activity (second-order rate constant 1. 4 x 10 (7) M- 1. min- 1). Incubation of S 9 B with brain microsomes led to specific covalent labelling of NTE as determined by detection of a biotinylated 155 kDa polypeptide on Western blots. Specificity of S 9 B labelling was further demonstrated by inhibition with the neuropathic OP mipafox.

40|$|Phosphotriesterase (PTE) is a zinc {{metalloenzyme}} that catalyzes the hydrolysis of organophosphorus compounds. Metal ion roles during binding and catalysis are probed {{by comparing}} the kinetic properties of Zn/Zn, Cd/Cd, and Zn/Cd PTE {{with a variety of}} phosphate trisesters. The metal in the &# 945;-site of the binuclear metal center modulates the pKa values determined from pH-rate profiles. These results suggest that the &# 945;-metal is responsible for activating the nucleophilic hydroxide. In an effort to determine the function of the &# 946;-metal, the kinetic parameters for diethyl p-chlorophenyl thiophosphate are compared with diethyl p-chlorophenyl phosphate. The thiophosphate substrate is hydrolyzed 20 to 100 -times faster than the phosphate substrate for Zn/Zn, Cd/Cd, and Zn/Cd PTE. When Cd 2 + occupies the &# 946;-site, the inverse thio effect increases which suggests polarization by the &# 946;-metal on the phosphoryl oxygen or sulfur bond. The catalytic roles of Asp 233, His 254, and Asp 301 are determined {{by comparing the}} kinetic parameters of a series of alanine and asparagine mutations with paraoxon and diethyl p-chlorophenyl phosphate. The increased rate of hydrolysis for diethyl p-chlorophenyl phosphate with the mutants is consistent with the existence of a proton relay system from Asp 301 to His 254 to Asp 233. A detailed mechanism for the hydrolysis of organophosphates by PTE has been proposed. PTE hydrolyzes a number of chiral <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>esters.</b> The pKa of the leaving group phenol is altered for a series of chiral phosphate, phosphonate, and phosphinate esters. The stereoselectivity of wild-type, G 60 A, and I 106 G/F 132 G/H 257 Y PTE is enhanced as the pKa value of the leaving group phenol increases for phosphate, phosphonate, and phosphinate esters. In addition to improving the stereoselectivity of phosphotriesterase, mutations that affect the size of the active site of PTE are screened to identify a mutant enzyme that preferentially hydrolyzes the opposite isomer of wild-type PTE. The rate constants and stereoselectivity ratios for a number of active site mutants have been determined. H 254 Y/L 303 T PTE reverses the stereoselective preference of phosphonate and phosphinate substrates. The PTE stereoselectivity of O-methyl, O-phenyl acetylphenyl phosphate is reversed 970 -fold by I 106 G/F 132 G/H 257 Y.

The antibiotic resistance that results from this hydrolysis is becoming an increased threat for the clinical community. These metalloenzymes can hydrolyze a wide range of β-lactam substrates, such as cephamycins and imipenem that are generally resistant t the serine-containing β-lactamases. Therefore, the clinical application of the entire range of antibiotics is severely compromised in bacteria that produce mβls. Due to the lack of information on the mechanism of mβls, to-date, no clinically known inhibitors is there for mβls. In this present study, we synthesized several mono and dizinc complexes as models for the mβls and investigated the differences in their hydrolytic properties. This study supports the assumption that the second zinc in the dinuclear enzymes does not directly involve in the catalysis, but may orient the substrates for hydrolysis and the basic amino acid residues such as Asp and His may activate the zinc-bound water molecules, fulfilling the role of the second zinc in the mononuclear enzymes. The effect of various side chains on the hydrolysis of some commonly used cephalosporin antibiotics by mβl from B. cereus is described. It is shown that the cephalosporins having heterocyclic thiol side chains are more resistance to mβl-mediated hydrolysis than the antibiotics that do not have such side chains. This is partly due to the inhibition of enzyme activity by the thiol moieties eliminated during the hydrolysis. It is also observed that the heterocyclic side chains in pure form inhibit the lactamase activity of mβl as well as its synthetic mimics. The mode of binding of these heterocyclic side chains to the zinc has been analyzed from the crystal structure of the tetranuclear zinc complexes. The theoretical studies suggest that the eliminated heterocyclic thiols undergo a rapid tautomerism to produce the corresponding thiones. These thiones are found to irreversibly inhibit the LPO-catalyzed iodination reaction. The reaction of various thiones with I 2 leads to the formation of thione-iodine complexes {{similar to that of the}} most commonly used antithyroid drug methimazole(MMI). These observations suggest that some of the latest generation of antibiotics may show negative effects on thyroid gland upon hydrolysis. Synthetic organophosphorus compounds have been used extensively as pesticides and petroleum additives. These compounds are very toxic to mammals and their widespread use in agriculture leads to serious environmental problems. Therfore, degradation of organophosphorus trimesters and remediation of associated contaminated sites are of worldwide concern. In this regards, the bacterial phsophotriesterase (PTE) enzyme plays an important role in degrading a wide range of <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>esters</b> and the active side of PTE has been shown to be very similar to that of mβl. This identification prompted us to check the hydrolysis of phosphotriesters by the mβl and its mimics. It has been observed that the dinuclear zine(II) complexes that do not allow a strong binding of phosphodiestes would be a better PTE mimics...|$|R
40|$|A {{heterogeneous}} {{group of}} cell-bound serine esterases (esterases with a reactive serine residue {{in the active}} center of the enzyme molecule) {{have been identified as}} necessary participants in a number of cellular processes including the antigen-induced release of histamine from sensitized slices of guinea pig lung (1) and from rat peritoneal mast cells sensitized with rat homocytotropic antibody (2) or rabbit anti-rat gamma globulin (3), and in the chemotactic responses of rabbit macrophages (4) and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) (5). The participation of serine esterases in these processes was primarily revealed by the use of phosphonate <b>esters,</b> <b>organophosphorus</b> compounds which act as selective inhibitors of this class of enzymes. These organophosphorus inhibitors have proved to be invaluable tools for obtaining information on {{at least one of the}} biochemical steps involved in some of the complex functions of living ceils. The inhibitory activity of organophosphorus compounds such as diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) and the phosphonate esters is based on their behavior as quasi-substrates for serine esterases.

40|$|Sarin is an <b>organophosphorus</b> (OP) <b>ester</b> {{chemical}} warfare agent (CWA) {{that has been}} used in past terrorist attacks. It remains a threat today because of its ease of manufacture and dispersal. Sarin acts by irreversibly inactivating acetylcholinesterase and interfering with neurotransmission by allowing acetylcholine to build up at neuro-effector junctions, where it continuously elicits a response. Symptoms of sarin toxicity include seizures, hypersecretions, respiratory distress and death in extreme cases. Previous studies on OP poisoning indicate that sarin exposure causes neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in conjunction with seizure activity. In order to determine the mode of neuronal death and the extent of neuroinflammation induced by sarin exposure, C 57 Bl/ 6 J mice were first dosed s. c. with 1. 5 mg/kg cresylbenzodioxaphosphorin oxide (CBDP) to inhibit the large amount of carboxylesterase found in rodents. One hour later, mice were dosed with 24 ug/kg sarin, a dose which produces approximately 17 % lethality. One group of mice was also dosed with 1. 7 mg/kg 8 -hydroxy- 2 -(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8 -OH-DPAT), a 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist, which has been shown by others to decrease different types of neuronal injury. Mice were sacrificed at times ranging from four hours to ten days after sarin administration and left or right brain hemispheres were collected and frozen in isopentane for histological examination. To detect DNA fragmentation, 10 um-thick sections were TUNEL-stained using the NeuroTACS II in situ apoptosis detection kit. Activated caspase- 3 and interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) were detected by immunohistochemistry to determine whether apoptotic cell death and neuroinflammation were occurring. Manual cell counts were performed on micrographs of dentate gyrus and CA 1 regions of hippocampus, amygdala and piriform cortex in NIH Image. Statistically significant TUNEL labeling was observed at various time points in all brain regions except CA 1 hippocampus. Significant increases in caspase- 3 staining were observed only in piriform cortex and CA 1 hippocampus at 24 hours and four days post-sarin injection, respectively. IL- 1 beta expression was significantly increased in CA 1 hippocampus at four days after sarin injection and in all brain regions except piriform cortex at ten days after sarin exposure. Neither TUNEL nor caspase- 3 labeling were significantly decreased with 8 -OH-DPAT treatment. The amygdala and dentate gyrus regions showed significant decreases in IL- 1 beta expression after 8 -OH-DPAT treatment. Statistically non-significant upward trends over time in TUNEL labeling and IL- 1 beta expression were observed. In contrast, caspase- 3 expression exhibited a gradual, non-significant decrease at later time points. These trends may be indicative of a decreasing role played by apoptotic cell death and an increasing or persisting role for oncotic cell death and inflammation in sarin neurotoxicity...|$|R
40|$|A {{quantitative}} structure property relationship (QSPR) for a,b-unsaturated carboxylates (mainly acrylates and methacrylates) {{was established}} in chapter 2. Chemical reaction rate constants were measured for 12 different chemicals with three different nucleophiles, namely H 2 O, OH - and glutathione (GSH). Relatively small {{differences were found in}} hydrolysis rates (reaction with H 2 O and OH -). At an elevated pH (8. 8) the hydrolysis half-life of the compound ranged between 7 and 40 days, with exception of diethyl fumarate (0. 4 day). A separation in two groups was observed for the reaction with GSH (Michael addition), where acrylates reacted approximately 100 times as fast as methacrylates. This difference was con- sistent with differences found in electronic structure, which was determined by quantum- chemical calculations. Because no single parameter could describe the electrophilic charac- ter of the unsaturated carboxylates satisfactory, four descriptors were pooled, using a multivariate correlation (partial least squares regression, PLS). The resulting QSPR for Michael addition was able to predict the reactivity of structurally related, unsaturated carboxylates. Acute fish toxicity of a set of acrylates and methacrylates was evaluated in chapter 3. Published four-day LC 50 data for fathead minnow were compared to the chemical reactivity of the compounds towards GSH, because Michael addition was expected to be the mecha- nism that causes harmful binding to essential biological thiol-sites in the fish (e. g. proteins and enzymes). A simple equation was used to model the interaction of electrophilic chemi- cals with GSH. The degree of GSH depletion, which was used to estimate the toxic effect, was found {{to be related to the}} product of aqueous exposure concentration and chemical reaction rate of the reactive compound. Although, all acrylates and methacrylates poten- tially could react with GSH, narcosis was judged to be an alternative mode of toxic action responsible for the observed acute toxicity. Potencies for GSH depletion and narcosis were compared on the bases of critical body residues and critical depletion rates. Five out of 12 compounds were thereby identified as narcosis chemicals on the bases of their high calcu- lated lethal body burden. It was concluded that, although the tested chemicals all contained a similar functional group, their mode of action regarding acute fish toxicity was not the same. Therefore, a correlation between chemical reaction rate and LC 50 for the whole test set of chemicals would not be meaningful. The results from chapter 3 indicated, that narcosis was an interfering mode of action in QSARÕs for fish toxicity of reactive chemicals. To evaluate this hypothesis, data of reactive chemicals from three different classes (unsaturated carboxylates, <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>esters?</b> 126 Chapter 8 Summary and General Discussion and nitrobenzenes) were taken from the literature and subjected to an analysis for multiple modes of action (chapter 4). The Toxic ratio, being the ratio between the observed LC 50 and the LC 50, predicted for the same compound by a narcosis QSAR was used to estimate the probability of a compound to act by narcosis. In total, 40 % of the 61 compounds tested were identified as Òprobably acting by narcosisÓ. For these compounds, a narcosis QSAR using the octanol/water partitioning coefficient (K OW) as sole descriptor was found to describe the toxicity. QSARÕs using reactivity descriptors, which in earlier work had been found insufficient to describe the toxicity of these classes of compounds improved considerably, if the Ònarcotic chemicalsÓ were excluded from the data sets. It was concluded, that narcosis should always be considered as a possible alternative cause of death in acute fish toxicity test, even if the chemicals seem to have a very specific mode of action. Additionally, it was shown, that QSARÕs should only be established for sets of chemicals with an identical mode of action. Modes of action clearly should not be confused with functional groups. The toxic effect of acrylates and methacrylates on a cellular level were investigated in chapter 5. Cellular glutathione (GSH) concentrations were recorded in isolated cells of rat livers. These cells have a continuous high expression of GSH and a broad range of metabo- lism. Potentially toxic metabolites of the acrylates and methacrylates were therefore likely to be produced in these cells. Furthermore, the additivity of the toxic effect of these chemi- cals was investigated in this in-vitro test. For each chemical, an EC 50 for GSH depletion was determined and used as an effect equivalent to compare their potencies. By testing two mixtures, each containing six individual chemicals, it could be shown that the depletion of GSH was dose-additive. This means that in a mixture of acrylates and methacrylates each individual chemical will contribute to the total toxic effect of the mixture. As expected, the compounds were metabolized by the hepatocytes. For one of them, allyl methacrylate, the very toxic metabolic product acrolein could be identified in the cell-culture medium. The production of this metabolite is most probably responsible for the high toxicity of this spe- cific compound towards the liver cells as well as towards fish (chapter 3). A preliminary physiologically based pharmacokinetic and -dynamic model (PBPK-PD) for ethyl acrylate (EA) was presented in chapter 6. It was based on an existing PBPK model for inert compounds in fish, which had been established by the US-EPA in Duluth, MN (1, 2). The model was adapted to be used with EA by adding elimination processes in several tissue compartments. Elimination rates of EA, which had been measured in-vitro, were extrapolated to whole organs. The turnover of GSH in the gills was modeled separately and was used to describe the toxic effect of EA on biological targets. Once the model was estab-?lished, several aspects of an aqueous exposure scenario were investigated. The uptake of EA in different organs of the fish was predicted to occur very rapidly (steady state concen- trations reached in minutes to a few hours) with exception of the fat tissue. The metabolic elimination of EA in the gills was not sufficient to cause a notable first pass effect. Conse- quently, the EA concentration in the gill tissue was predicted to be almost instantaneously at equilibrium with the aqueous exposure concentration. The EA concentration in the gills was subsequently used in the biological effect sub-model to describe the depletion of GSH. For a simulated exposure scenario close to a lethal aqueous concentration, the GSH concen- tration in the gills decreased by 60 % during the first 6 hours. This forecast was in agree- ment with experimental observations. In contrast to an existing rat model for EA, the trout model did not predict a first pass elimination of EA and therefore a systemic distribution can be expected in the fish. In both models, however, a local depletion of the GSH level at the site of adsorption was evident. In chapter 7, several findings from the previous chapters were combined to postulate an elementary approach to model toxic effects of reactive chemicals in aquatic organisms. The most important simplification of this approach was, to disregard the pharmacokinetics of moderately hydrophobic reactive chemical in aquatic organisms. This resulted in a elemen- tary pharmacodynamic model (EPD), which describes a target and the interaction of a reac- tive chemical with this target. This approach can be used to describe time and concentration dependent toxicological effects. Models, based on this approach were found to give excel- lent description of experimental data on acetylcholine-esterase inhibition due to OP-esters in several aquatic animals. The approach was also able to predict time dependent effect concentrations (e. g. LC 50). Under certain conditions, the EPD model can be reduced to an equivalent of HaberÕs Law, which states that the product of concentration and exposure time will be constant. In addition to this, the EPD model can give a rational interpretation of threshold concentration, which are often observed in toxicity experiments...|$|R

Pokusi s luminolskom reakcijom mogu poslužiti za brzo eksperimentalno ispitivanje inhibitorskih osobina oksima. It {{has been}} found that oximes with widely {{different}} chemical structure are effective inhibitors of the luminol reaction catalysed by <b>organophosphorus</b> compounds (<b>esters</b> of phosphoric or thiophosphoric acid, insecticides. nerve gases) or various complexes with iron. The reaction mechanism of the inhibition is closely related to the reactivation of cholinesterase inhibited by organo-phosphorus compounds with oximes. The reactivation of the inhibited cholinesterase is generally considered as due to the chemical interaction of oximes with inhibitor (organophosphorus compounds). The mechanism of the inhibition of luminol reaction probably consist of the interaction of inhibitor (oxime) with catalyst (organophosphorus compound. complex of iron). The study of inhibition of the luminol reaction with oximes provides a means for a simple evaluation of inhibitory properties of various oximes. The results of the measurements of inhibitory effect of 16 oximes on the luminol reaction catalysed by hemoglobin or potassium ferricyanide are described in this paper. By means of photoelectric measurements the relationship between the intensity (G) of chemiluminescence of luminol (in alkaline solutions in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and appropriate catalyst). and reaction time (t) with or without oximes (Fig. 1, 2, 3, and 4) was established. Maximal intensity of chemiluminescence (Gm) was used as a relative value of the maximal velocity of luminol reaction. From the relationship between maximal velocity and oxime concentration, the concentration for 50 % inhibition (i 1 / 2) can be determined. These concentrations are listed in Tables 1 and 2. It is evident that these concentrations are within relatively broad range, between 6, 5, 10 - 5 M and 5, 9, 10 - 3 M, and that they depend upon the nature and concentration of inhibitors used in the reaction. lt was further found that the yellow colour of some oximes in the alkaline solution has an insignificant role in the process of inhibition caused by oximes. This fact has been established by quantitative measurement of light absorption of oxime solution at various wave lengths (Curves 3 and 4, Fig. 7), followed by the numerical interpretation of the obtained results taking into account the spectral distribution of emitted light of luminol (Curve 2, Fig. 7) and the sensitivity of the photoelement (Curve I, Fig. 7). Spectral curves obtained {{as a result of these}} proceedings are shown in Fig. 8. It is evident that the absorption of light by oximes does not influence the luminescence appreciably. Tables 3 and 4 show the experimentally determined i 1 / 2 and mathematically corrected i 1 / 2 concentrations of P 3 AM and P 4 AM. The inhibition of the luminol reaction with oximes represents a competitive inhibition (Fig. 9 and JO) as shown by means of kinetic analysis (13. 14). The dissociation constant (Ki) of the compound obtained by the chemical combination of oximes (DAM and C- 4 -dioxime) with catalysts (hemoglobin or K 3 [Fe(CN) 6]) was determined by the use of Dixon equation (2). The constant of inhibition, according to the equation (3) or (4), decreases when the concentration of substrate increases, what is in agreement with the theory of competitive inhibition. The possible influence of the ionic state of some oximes on the mechanism of inhibition is discussed. Ions of oximes (I- and Br-) evidently have no influence on the velocity of the luminol reaction. The results of the studies of the influence of oximes on the luminol reaction catalyzed by organophosphorus compounds will be published elsewhere...|$|R
