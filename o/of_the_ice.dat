5|$|It is {{possible}} that a panmictic (random mating) wolf population, with gene flow spanning Eurasia and North America, existed until the closing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> sheets, after which the southern wolves became isolated, and only the Beringian wolf existed north of the sheets.

40|$|In {{this work}} a new {{approach}} for ice repellent coatings is presented. It was shown that the coatings cause a decrease or increase in <b>the</b> freezing temperature <b>of</b> water depending on <b>the</b> alignment <b>of</b> an external electric field. For this coating the commonly used pyroelectric polymer polyvenylidene fluoride was deposited as a thin film on glass. The samples were dip-coated and subsequently thermally-treated at 140 °C for 1 h. All samples were found to cause a reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>icing</b> temperature <b>of</b> water on their surface in comparison to uncoated glass. On several samples an external electric field was applied during this thermal treatment. The field application was found to cause a remarkable reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>icing</b> temperature where a maximum lowering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> freezing temperature <b>of</b> 3 K compared to uncoated glass could be achieved. The actual achieved reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>icing</b> temperature was observed to depend on <b>the</b> polarity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field applied during the thermal treatment. Furthermore, a repetition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thermal treatment under oppositely directed electric fields led to a switchable freezing behavior of water according to <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> applied field. With {{an increasing number of}} cycles <b>of</b> switching <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>icing</b> property a slight training effect towards lower freezing temperatures was observed...|$|R
