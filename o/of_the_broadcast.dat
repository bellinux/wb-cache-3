5|$|The {{main event}} from Raw was a Last Man Standing match, where {{the goal is}} to {{incapacitate}} the opponent long enough for a 10-count. In his third match of the night, Triple H defended his WWE Championship against Randy Orton. Both men fought extensively outside the ring, both taking advantage of the match stipulations, where there are no countouts or disqualifications. At one point, both men were positioned on top of one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadcast</b> tables, where Orton attempted an RKO on Triple H, who countered the move and sent Orton through another <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadcast</b> tables. Triple H followed this by striking Orton with the steel steps. The men returned to the ring, and Orton performed a DDT and an RKO on Triple H, both onto a steel chair. The competitors returned to the outside of the ring again, and Triple H struck Orton with a chair. They returned to the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadcast</b> table, and Triple H attempted a Pedigree through the table on Orton, who countered into an RKO onto the table. The referee began a count and reached ten before Triple H could rise; in result, Orton won the match and subsequently regained the WWE Championship.|$|E

40|$|Between 1946 and 1956, {{a number}} of BBC radio {{broadcasts}} were made by pioneers in <b>the</b> fields <b>of</b> computing, artificial intelligence and cybernetics.

5|$|Around mid-September 1943, the two-man Bf 110 {{crew was}} {{augmented}} {{by a third}} member, {{sometimes referred to as}} Bordmechaniker (air mechanic) or Bordschütze (air gunner). The reason for this was that the decline of the Himmelbett procedure, the introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadcast</b> procedure Zahme Sau, and the growing threat of RAF intruder night fighter operations, had necessitated the need for another pair of watchful eyes to the rear. Unteroffizier Wilhelm Gänsler, who had already contributed to 17 claims made by Hauptmann Ludwig Becker, was Schnaufer's new lookout. With Handtke and Gänsler as his crew, Schnaufer claimed his 26th aerial victory on 23 September 1943 over a No. 218 Squadron Stirling during a Wilde Sau intercept mission.|$|E
5|$|Conflicts between Armenia and Azerbaijan first {{appeared}} in 2006, when Azeri media criticized the event's website for listing Nagorno-Karabakh as the birthplace of Armenia's first representative, André, as {{it was part of}} the Azerbaijan SSR at the time. Conflicts notably escalated throughout the 2009 contest: during the semi-finals, Azeri officials objected to the depiction of the Nagorno-Karabakh monument We Are Our Mountains during an introductory video for the Armenian entry. Armenia responded during the finals by displaying multiple images of the monument whilst presenting its results. Following the contest, allegations emerged that Azerbaijan's state broadcaster had tampered with its feed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadcast</b> to censor the Armenian entry, and that the Azeri government was interrogating citizens who voted for Armenia, accusing them of being unpatriotic and a threat to security. Following an inquiry, Azerbaijan was fined by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) for breaching the privacy of voters.|$|E

Part 2 ran into the early morning hours—as late as 3:00a.m. ET/PT.

5|$|Following the {{relaunch}} of Star Trek in 2009 {{with a new}} cast playing those roles seen in The Original Series, {{there was}} commentary online {{about the lack of}} female characters and whether Rand might be appearing in future installments.

But there was still speculation at the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadcast</b> of the first trailer about who Alice Eve was portraying in the film. The options given by Tor.com was that it was either Janice Rand or Carol Marcus. Daily Variety reported that she was cast as someone new to the franchise, but she was actually cast as Marcus.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation {{gave the}} four {{recognized}} parties free air time for political statements. The television broadcasts's audio tracks served also {{for use on}} radio. The three opposition parties gave their party leader all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadcast</b> time, though Diefenbaker, who did not speak French well, played only a limited role in the Tories' French-language broadcasts. In one, he introduced party president Léon Balcer, a Quebecer, who gave the speech. Diefenbaker had no objection to makeup and, according to Meisel, was prepared to adopt any technique which would make his presentation more effective. A survey in populous southwestern Ontario showed that Diefenbaker made the strongest impression of the four leaders.|$|E
