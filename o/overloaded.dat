40|$|Abstract-The {{effect of}} single-cycle <b>overloads</b> on the {{subsequent}} fatigue crack growth behavior of Incond 600 is studied. <b>Overloads</b> ranging from 10 to 50 % {{are applied to}} a sample undergoing baseline fatigue crack growth at constant AK. In all cases, the crack growth rate increases lightly immediately after the <b>overload</b> and then decreases rapidly to a minimum value before later returning to the pre-overload value. The plastic zone size, affected crack length and the crack growth increment at minimum crack growth rate, a’, are measured for each <b>overload.</b> The affected crack length is considerably larger than the <b>overload</b> plastic zone size for <b>overloads</b> greater than ZtQ. Consequently, although the minimum crack growth rate occurs within the plane stress <b>overload</b> plastic zone, {{the effect of the}} <b>overload</b> extends well beyond the <b>overload</b> region. Within the <b>overload</b> plastic zone, contact occurs between the crack faces due to the excessive deformation produced during the <b>overload</b> cycle. The size of the contact region agrees very well with the <b>overload</b> plastic zone size. Beyond the <b>overload</b> region, AI & remains less than the applied AK for some time due to the wedge action of the plastically deformed <b>overload</b> region, delaying recovery of the pre-overload crack growth rate.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{usefulness}} of thallium- 201 myocardial imaging in assessing right ventricular (RV) <b>overloading</b> was evaluated and {{compared with the}} electrocardiographic and hemodynamic measurements. Multiple unprocessed photoscans were obtained using a gamma camera in 47 patients who had chronic RV <b>overload,</b> including 28 subjects with pressure <b>overload,</b> 14 with volume <b>overload</b> and five with pressure and volume <b>overload.</b> With pressure <b>overload</b> the degree of RV visualization (RVV) was correlated with elevation of RV systolic pressure. With volume <b>overload</b> the RV free wall was visualized in all patients, and RVV was correlated with the increment in pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio. Pressure and volume <b>overload</b> could be differentiated from the morphologic characteristics of myocardial image. With pressure <b>overload</b> the interventricular septum appeared straight. With volume <b>overload</b> the RV cavity appeared to be dilated and the interventricular septum convex to the right ventricle. Myocardial images were compared with ECG findings of RV hypertrophy in cases with pressure <b>overload.</b> RVV intensity correlated {{with the number of}} criteria (Sokolow and Lyon) satisfied in each tracing. The sen-sitivity of myocardial imaging for diagnosis of RV pressure <b>overload</b> was 93. 3 %, higher than that of ECG cri-teria for RV hypertrophy.

Contrary to traditional views, we analyze current data center logs and realistic Web workloads to show that <b>overload</b> is largely transient: up to 88. 1 % of <b>overloads</b> last for less than 2 minutes. Regarding <b>overload</b> as a continuum that includes both transient and sustained <b>overloads</b> of various durations points us to consider mitigation approaches also as a continuum, complete with tradeoffs with respect to application performance and data center overhead. In particular, heavyweight techniques, like VM migration, are better suited to sustained <b>overloads,</b> whereas lightweight approaches, like network memory, are better suited to transient <b>overloads.</b> We present Overdriver, a system that adaptively takes advantage of these tradeoffs, mitigating all <b>overloads</b> within 8 % of well-provisioned performance.

40|$|In {{the present}} work {{experiments}} were performed in Instron- 8502 machine with a 250 kN load cell capacity. All {{tests were conducted}} in air and at room temperature. Tests were performed to investigate the effect of multiple consecutive <b>overload</b> cycles on constant amplitude fatigue crack propagation rate. For this purpose constant amplitude fatigue tests were carried out and <b>overload</b> was applied at an a/w ratio of 0. 4 in all specimens, following which the same constant amplitude tests were continued. The <b>overload</b> ratio was maintained at 1. 9 in all cases {{and the number of}} <b>overload</b> cycles applied was 1, 2, 5, 10 and 100. From experimental data it has been observed that a single spike <b>overload</b> (1 cycle) gives maximum retardation and the retardation effect decreases with the increase in number of <b>overload</b> cycles. The number of delay cycles (ND) and the retarded crack length (aD) were obtained for all the above cases. The values of both these parameters decreased with increase in number of <b>overload</b> cycles. Finally a model has been developed to predict the post-overload life of a specimen. The model was developed with experimental data of 1, 2, 5 and 100 <b>overload</b> cycles and was verified by comparing predicted data and experimental data for 10 <b>overload</b> cycles. The fractured surfaces of the test specimens were examined under SEM in order to investigate the nature of crack growth under different <b>overload</b> cycles. Fractogrpahs show that presence of micro voids and secondary cracks in the tear zone. This suggests development of a highly strained zone on application of <b>overload</b> cycles. It may be recalled that the extent of retardation reduces on application of multiple <b>overload</b> cycles. The <b>overload</b> tear zones are measured in different cases which show a maximum in case of 100 cycles. The width of the tear zones are nearly same for specimens subjected to <b>overload</b> cycles 2, 5 and 10. This suggests significant stress relaxation on application of large number of <b>overload</b> cycles. Thus the reduction in magnitude of retardation in case of multiple <b>overloading</b> may be due to stress relaxation and it becomes significant for large number of <b>overload</b> cycles. ...|$|R

The incidence of fluid <b>overload</b> is underreported and its economic impact is unknown. An evaluation of fluid <b>overload</b> cases in US hospitals was performed {{to assess the impact}} of fluid <b>overload</b> on length and cost of hospital stay. Study design and methods: Retrospective analysis was performed using a clinical and economic database covering > 600 US hospitals. Data were collected for all inpatients discharged during 2010 who received ≥ 1 unit FFP during hospitalization. Incidence of fluid <b>overload</b> was determined through International Classification of Diagnosis (ICD- 9) codes. Multivariate regression analysis was performed for primary outcome measures: hospital length of stay (LOS) and total hospital costs. Results: Data were analyzed for 129, 839 FFP-transfused patients, of whom 4, 138 (3. 2 %) experienced fluid <b>overload</b> (including TACO). Multivariate analysis, adjusting for baseline characteristics, found that increased LOS and hospital costs were independently associated with fluid <b>overload.</b> Patients diagnosed with fluid <b>overload</b> had longer mean LOS (12. 9 days versus 10. 0 days; P < 0. 001) and higher mean hospital cost per visit ($ 46, 644 versus $ 32, 582; P < 0. 001) compared with patients without fluid <b>overload.</b> Conclusion: For a population of US inpatients who received FFP during hospitalization, fluid <b>overload</b> was associated with a 29 % increase in LOS and a $ 14, 062 increase in hospital costs per visit.
