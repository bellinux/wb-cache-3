5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of humans roughly 1500 to 2000years ago, lemurs were found all across the island. However, early {{settlers}} quickly converted the forests to rice paddies and grassland through slash-and-burn agriculture (known locally as tavy), restricting lemurs to approximately 10% of the island's area, ~60,000km2 (23,000sq mi). Today, the diversity and complexity of lemur communities increases with floral diversity and precipitation and is highest in the rainforests of the east coast, where precipitation and floral diversity are also at their highest. Despite their adaptations for weathering extreme adversity, habitat destruction and hunting have resulted in lemur populations declining sharply, and their diversity has diminished, with the recent extinction of at least 17species in eight genera, known collectively as the subfossil lemurs. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>approximately</b> 100species and subspecies of lemur are either threatened or endangered. Unless trends change, extinctions are likely to continue.|$|E

Originally, all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>approximately</b> 700 prisoners were shipped to Angra do Heroísmo, on Terceira Island in the Azores, where they were held at the Fortress of São João Baptista. In 1918, to reduce overcrowding at the fortress, 168 internees were moved to Caldas, where they stayed in military barracks located at the Parque D. Carlos I (Pavilhões do Parque).

5|$|During the referendum, 84% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>approximately</b> 7.5 million voters {{approved}} the amendments. On November 28 of that year, President Lukashenko signed the changes into law. Other results {{not directly related}} to the voting included the expanding role of the Council of Ministers, which allowed it to deal with issues related to development of economic, social and political spheres within Belarus. The 1996 referendum was not, however, the first call to dissolve the Supreme Soviet. In 1991 and 1992, after the August coup in Moscow by senior CPSU officials, democratic forces in the government wanted to dissolve the Supreme Soviet permanently. The members of the Belarusian Popular Front pressed for a referendum, and despite achieving the number of signatures required by law at the time, the Supreme Soviet quashed the measure.|$|E
5|$|For centuries, Taiwan's {{aboriginal}} inhabitants experienced economic {{competition and}} military conflict {{with a series}} of colonising newcomers. Centralised government policies designed to foster language shift and cultural assimilation, as well as continued contact with the colonisers through trade, intermarriage and other intercultural processes, have resulted in varying degrees of language death and loss of original cultural identity. For example, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>approximately</b> 26 known languages of the Taiwanese aborigines (collectively referred to as the Formosan languages), at least ten are now extinct, five are moribund and several are to some degree endangered. These languages are of unique historical significance, since most historical linguists consider Taiwan to be the original homeland of the Austronesian language family.|$|E

Between six and eight US airmen shot down on 5May were subjected to vivisection at the Kyushu Imperial University; Professor Fukujirō Ishiyama and other doctors conducted four such sessions throughout May and early June. The Western Military Command assisted in arranging these operations. Many of the Japanese personnel {{responsible for the deaths}} of Allied airmen were prosecuted in the Yokohama War Crimes Trials following the war. Several of those found guilty were executed and the remainder were imprisoned.|$|E
