5|$|Chris Chibnall {{wanted to}} write a story that tackled the issue <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> {{revolved}} around a missing person case. Executive producer Russell T Davies appreciated the character dynamics and domestic themes in the episode and cited the script as one of his inspirations in continuing the series. Ruth Jones, who is generally better known for her comedic roles, was cast against type in the central guest role of Nikki Bevan. The episode was filmed largely on location in South Wales with the island of Flat Holm featuring prominently. Response to the episode was generally positive. Reviewers generally praised the episode for illuminating the conflicting elements of Gwen's character and providing a central dilemma with no easy answer. Some critics identified ostensible plot holes, though felt that the episode's emotional successes negated these.|$|E
5|$|Horowitz {{points out}} that the film's {{dichotomy}} of absolute good versus absolute evil glosses over the fact that most Holocaust perpetrators were ordinary people; the movie does not explore how the average German rationalized their knowledge of or participation in the Holocaust. Author Jason Epstein commented that the movie gives the impression that if people were smart enough or lucky enough, they could survive the Holocaust; this was not actually the case. Spielberg responded to criticism that Schindler's breakdown as he says farewell is too maudlin and even out of character by pointing out that the scene is needed to drive home the sense <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> to allow the viewer an opportunity to mourn alongside the characters on the screen.|$|E

5|$|Triptych, May–June 1973 is a {{triptych}} {{completed in}} 1973 by the Irish-born artist Francis Bacon (1909–1992). The oil-on-canvas was painted {{in memory of}} Bacon's lover George Dyer, who committed suicide {{on the eve of}} the artist's retrospective at Paris's Grand Palais on 24 October 1971. The triptych is a portrait of the moments before Dyer's death from an overdose of pills in their hotel room. Bacon was haunted and preoccupied by Dyer's loss for the remaining years of his life and painted many works based on both the actual suicide and the events of its aftermath. He admitted to friends that he never fully recovered, describing the 1973 triptych as an exorcism of his feelings <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> guilt.|$|E

25|$|Grief is a {{multifaceted}} response to loss, {{particularly to the}} loss of someone or something that has died, to which a bond or affection was formed. Although conventionally focused on the emotional response to loss, it also has physical, cognitive, behavioral, social, cultural, and philosophical dimensions. While the terms are often used interchangeably, bereavement refers to the state <b>of</b> <b>loss,</b> <b>and</b> grief is the reaction to that loss.|$|E

25|$|Many of the Judaean Jews {{were sold}} into slavery while others became {{citizens}} of {{other parts of}} the Roman Empire. The book of Acts in the New Testament, as well as other Pauline texts, make frequent reference to the large populations of Hellenised Jews in the cities of the Roman world. These Hellenised Jews were affected by the diaspora only in its spiritual sense, absorbing the feeling <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> homelessness that became a cornerstone of the Jewish creed, much supported by persecutions {{in various parts of the}} world. The policy encouraging proselytism and conversion to Judaism, which spread the Jewish religion throughout the Hellenistic civilization, seems to have subsided with the wars against the Romans.|$|E

25|$|Within {{the series}} narrative, Jackie is a widow who lives {{alone with her}} {{daughter}} Rose until Rose leaves her mundane life behind to travel through time and space with the Doctor. Jackie's feeling <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> of being left behind is explored in subsequent episodes. As the character is brought into danger by her proximity to the Doctor, she resents his influence over Rose. However, once he undergoes a regeneration, effectively becoming a new man, Jackie has a more cordial relationship with him. The character was written {{out at the end}} of the 2006 series, along with Rose, in a storyline which sees them trapped in a parallel universe where Jackie forms a new relationship with an alternate version of her deceased husband Pete Tyler.|$|E
25|$|Other {{tests of}} {{employment}} {{have focused on}} different contractual and external factors. Lord Denning proposed a test based on the integration of an individual to a business or organisation. Tests based on the economic relationship between an employer and employee have found favour in subsequent cases, notably Market Investigations Ltd v Minister of Social Security, in the decision of Lord Cooke. Here, it was argued that where a person was in business on their own account (and at their own risk), they would be under a contract for services, whilst otherwise they would be under a contract of service. This idea have been cited with approval by the Privy Council, with several relevant factors being considered, such as risk <b>of</b> <b>loss,</b> <b>and</b> chance of profit.|$|E
25|$|DDT is a {{persistent}} organic pollutant that is readily adsorbed to soils and sediments, which can act both as sinks and as long-term sources of exposure affecting organisms. Depending on conditions, its soil half-life can range from 22 days to 30 years. Routes <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> degradation include runoff, volatilization, photolysis and aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation. Due to hydrophobic properties, in aquatic ecosystems DDT and its metabolites are absorbed by aquatic organisms and adsorbed on suspended particles, leaving little DDT dissolved in the water. Its breakdown products and metabolites, DDE and DDD, are also persistent and have similar chemical and physical properties. DDT and its breakdown products are transported from warmer areas to the Arctic by the phenomenon of global distillation, where they then accumulate in the region's food web.|$|E

Drake also employs a series of elemental symbols and codes, largely drawn from nature. The moon, stars, sea, rain, trees, sky, mist and seasons are all commonly used, influenced in part by his rural upbringing. Images related to summer figure centrally in his early work; from Bryter Layter on, his language is more autumnal, evoking a season commonly used to convey senses <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> sorrow.
