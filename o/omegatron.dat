50|$|When the Black Knight {{was turned}} into stone by the Enchantress, Aragorn {{was placed in the}} custody of his fellow Defender, the Valkyrie. Aragorn carried the Valkyrie and Namorita into battle against the <b>Omegatron.</b> When Whitman left his own time to stay for a while in the 12th Century AD, he {{entrusted}} Aragorn to the care of the Valkyrie, who became his permanent companion. He came to live at the Richmond Riding Academy. He accompanied the Valkyrie to Asgard and Valhalla, and helped Valkyrie, Harokin, and the Defenders battle Ollerus and Casiolena. With Valkyrie, Aragorn helped form the New Defenders.|$|E
40|$|A simple <b>Omegatron</b> mass {{analyzer}} {{used for}} measuring density and temperature of nitrogen in the 100 to 350 km {{region of the}} upper atmosphere has been developed. The mechanical and electrical configurations have been designed for rocket flight application, and the operating parameters optimized for the upper atmosphere measurement. This <b>Omegatron</b> is calibrated and flown {{as part of a}} sounding rocket experiment known as the Thermosphere Probe, which also contains an electron temperature probe for determining electron temperature and density. Several successful flights have shown that the <b>Omegatron</b> is a reliable device for this application...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of the <b>omegatron,</b> which operates on the cyclotron principle, to mass spectrometry is well known. Investigation {{of the effects of}} electric and magnetic field inhomogeneities has lead to improvement of the practical resolving power. Some data {{on the nature of the}} background ion current are included. Construction details of an <b>omegatron</b> which is useful up to mass 100 are given.

40|$|A new mass {{spectrometer}} of the <b>omegatron</b> type {{has been designed}} and tested. This new device, which we have called the resotron, combines the extremely low permanent outgassing and pumping rates of the <b>omegatron</b> (less than 10 - 11 torr liter/sec. and 10 - 3 liter/sec. respectively) with a high scanning rate (typically 10 spectra/sec.) allowing the spectrum to be displayed on an oscilloscope. The sensitivity is about 10 - 12 torr of partial pressure and the resolving power (at 5 % peak height) is about 40 at mass 40 for B = 4000 Gauss, or 70 at mass 70 for B = 12000 Gauss. In this paper, the performances of the <b>omegatron</b> and the resotron are compared. An original theory of the cyclotron resonance is developed. Based upon a circular motion approximation, this general treatment {{is applied to the}} case of the perturbation caused by the space charge of the beans, and for the conditions of rapid scanning over the resonance frequency. Experimental data are compared with the theoretical predictions. A brief description of the electronics is also given...|$|E
40|$|An <b>Omegatron</b> type mass {{spectrometer}} {{has been investigated}} both theoretically and experimentally to determine its detailed operation and limitations. Resolution, peak height, shape and frequency have been calculated theoretically and compared experimentally. A method is given for sketching ion trajectories in the nonlinear case (e. g., with space charge). Using this method, it is shown that {{a small amount of}} space charge will seriously hamper the operation of the <b>Omegatron</b> in that it will limit the maximum excursion of a resonant ion and thus limit the possible resolution. It is shown that under normal operating conditions a trapping voltage is necessary to maintain ion collection efficiency, and that this trapping voltage causes a space charge sufficient in size to result in nonlinear ion trajectories and poor operation. It is concluded that in order to get good operation of the <b>Omegatron</b> some method will have to be found for eliminating the space charge or its effects. Several possibilities for doing this are suggested, the most intriguing one being to use a dipole type of RF electric field rather then a uniform one...|$|E

40|$|Suitable {{analytical}} methods must be tested and developed for monitoring the individual process steps within the fuel cycle of a fusion reactor and for tritium accountability. The utility of laser-Raman spectroscopy accompanied by mass spectrometry with an <b>Omegatron</b> was investigated using {{the analysis of}} all hydrogen isotopes and isotopically labeled methanes as an example. The <b>Omegatron</b> is useful for analyzing all hydrogen isotopes mixed with the stable helium isotopes. The application of this mass spectrometer were demonstrated by analyzing mixtures of deuterated methanes. In addition, it was employed to study the radiochemical Witzbach exchange reaction between tritium and methanes. A laser-Raman spectrometer was designed for analysis of tritium-containing gases and was built from individual components. A tritium-compatible, metal-sealed Raman cuvette having windows with good optical properties and additional means for measuring the stray light was first used successfully in this work. The Raman spectra of the hydrogen isotopes were acquired in the pure rotation mode and in the rotation-vibration mode and were used for on. The deuterated methanes were measured by Raman spectroscopy, the wavenumbers determined {{were assigned to the}} corresponding vibrations, and the wavenumbers for the rotational fine-structure were summarized in tables. The fundamental Vibrations of the deuterated methanes produced Witzbach reactions were detected and assigned. The fundamental vibrations of the molecules were obtained with Raman spectroscopy {{for the first time in}} this work. The @-Raman spectrometer assembled is well suited for the analysis of tritium- containing gases and is practical in combination with mass spectrometry using an <b>Omegatron,</b> for studying gases used in fusion...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} the {{launching}} of two Marshall-University of Michigan Probes (MUMP 9 and MUMP 10), Nike-Tomahawk sounding rocket payloads, are summarized. The MUMP 9 paylaod included an <b>omegatron</b> mass analyzer, a molecular fluorescence densitometer, a mini-tilty filter, and a lunar position sensor. This complement of instruments permitted {{the determination of the}} molecular nitrogen density and temperature in the altitude range from approximately 143 to 297 km over Wallops Island, Virginia, during January 1971. The MUMP 10 payload included an <b>omegatron</b> mass analyzer, an electron temperature probe (Spencer, Brace, and Carignan, 1962), a cryogenic densitometer, and a solar position sensor. This complement of instruments permitted the determination of the molecular nitrogen density and temperature and the charged particle density and temperature in the altitude range from approximately 145 to 290 km over Wallops Island, Virginia, during the afternoon preceding the MUMP 9 launch in January 1971. A general description of the payload kinematics, orientation analysis, and the technique for the reduction and analysis of the data is given...|$|E

40|$|Ion {{cyclotron}} resonance heating in the magnetized sheet plasma is studied experimentally in a linear plasma device, TPD-SheetIV. We have demonstrated the ICRH of the helium or helium/hydrogen mixture sheet plasma by the RF electrodes of two parallel plates, sandwiching the sheet plasma. Measurements of the ion temperature in the plasma were carried out by a Faraday cup. In addition, the ion densities in the plasma were measured by an <b>omegatron</b> mass analyzer. The resonance frequencies fRF is slightly higher than the ion cyclotron frequency of helium fci. The ion densities Ni of He + rapidly decreases with increasing the PRF, although H + and H 2 + gradually decrease...|$|E
40|$|The San Marco C- 2 spacecraft, now {{designated}} San Marco- 4, {{was successfully}} launched by a Scout vehicle from the San Marco Platform on 18 February 1974 at 6 : 05 a. m. EDT. The launch occurred 2 hours 50 {{minutes into the}} 3 -hour window due co low cloud cover at the launch site. All spacecraft subsystems have been checked and are functioning normally. The protective caps for the two U. S. experiments were ejected and the <b>Omegatron</b> experiment activated on 19 February. The neutral mass spectrometer was activated as scheduled on 22 February after sufficient time to allow for spacecraft outgassing and to avoid the possibility of corona occurring. Both instruments are performing properly and worthwhile scientific data is being acquired...|$|E
40|$|An atomic oxygen beam {{system has}} been {{designed}} and tested for the laboratory evaluation of mass spectrometers used in upper atmospheric measurements. The atomic oxygen is generated by thermal dissociation of molecular oxygen {{on the surface of}} a tungsten filament heated to 2800 K. A symmetrical bidirectional beam is produced to permit simultaneous monitoring of the particle flux in the beam while target experiments are being conducted. Flux levels of 5 × 1014 particles cm− 2 sec− 1 over a cross‐sectional area of 1 cm 2 have been produced with a relative atomic oxygen concentration of 70 %. At flux levels below 1013 particles cm− 2 sec− 1, relative atomic oxygen concentrations of more than 90 % were obtained. The oxygen beam is of high purity and free from chemically active contaminants. Strong chemical and low temperature pumping are used to reduce background gas contributions to less than 1 %. Measurements of the relative atomic concentration in the beam were made with a quadrupole spectrometer using an open flowthrough ion source. The absolute flux of molecular oxygen was determined with the aid of an enclosed <b>omegatron</b> mass spectrometer. The combined use of both instruments permitted a determination of the magnitude of the atomic oxygen flux in the beam...|$|E
40|$|On {{or about}} 24 April 1971, the San Marco-C {{spacecraft}} will be launched from the San Marco Range located {{off the coast}} of Kenya, Africa, by a Scout launch vehicle. The launch will be conducted by an Italian crew. The San Marco-C is the third cooperative satellite project between Italy and the United States. The first such cooperative project resulted in the San Marco- 1 satellite which was launched into orbit from the Wallops Island Range with a Scout vehicle on 15 December 1964. The successful launch demonstrated the readiness of the Italian Centro Ricerche Aerospaziuli (CRA) launch crews to launch the Scout vehicle and qualified the basic spacecraft design. The second in the series of cooperative satellite launches was the San Marco-II which was successfully launched into orbit from the San Marco Range on 26 April 1967. This was the first Scout launch from the San Marco Range. The San Marco-II carried the same accelerometer as San Marco- 1, but the orbit permitted the air drag to be studied in detail in the equatorial region. The successful launch also served to qualify the San Marco Range as a reliable facility for future satellite launches, and has since been used for the successful launch of SAS-A (Explorer 42). This cooperative project has been implemented jointly by the Italian Space Commission and NASA. The CRA provided the spacecraft, its subsystems, and an air drag balance; Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) provided an <b>omegatron</b> and a neutral mass spectrometer, technical consultation and support. In addition, NASA provided the Scout launch vehicle. The primary scientific objective of the San Marco-C is to obtain, by measurement, a description of the equatorial neutral-particle atmosphere in terms of its density, com- position, and temperature at altitudes of 200 km and above, and to obtain a description of variations that result from solar and geomagnetic activities. The secondary scientific objective is to investigate the interdependence of three neutral-density-measurement techniques from one spacecraft: direct particle detection, direct drag, and integrated drag...|$|E
