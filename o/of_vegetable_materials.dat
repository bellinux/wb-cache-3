40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{analyzed}} the hydration properties <b>of</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>materials,</b> namely carrots and mushrooms, {{by means of}} the Flory-Rehner theory. This is done to circumvent problems with the ill-defined concept of water holding capacity. Via this thermodynamic theory one can predict the hydration properties {{for a wide range of}} mechanical loads. The theory is compared to measurements on the hydration of the vegetable samples in centrifugation experiments. The theory predicts two contributions to the hydration properties, which are due to 1) mixing free energy of water and food ingredients, and 2) the elastic energy of the crosslinked network of cell wall materials (i. e. the dietary fibers). Via independent measurements of the moisture sorption isotherms, we have quantified of the mixing contribution, which can be described by the volume-averaged Flory-Huggins Free Volume theory. From combined analysis of centrifugation and sorption experiments, we have obtained the elastic contribution, which is shown to follows the Flory-Rehner theory. Remarkably, the cell wall materials of carrots and mushrooms show very similar elastic behavior. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} conducted was the creation of a model of the phenomenon of the external friction <b>of</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>materials</b> using a feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN). The network was taught using a modified error backpropagation algorithm. The best modelling accuracy was obtained for a three-layer neural network having 11 neurons in the first hidden layer, 13 neurons in the second hidden layer and 1 neuron in the output layer. The accuracy of the ANN obtained was compared to the result of a theoretical-experimental model (TEM). A multiaspect analysis of the accuracy of the models investigated was conducted. It was concluded that the model of the phenomenon of external friction which made use of the artificial neural network gave a higher accuracy of the predicted value of the friction force than did the theoretical-experimental model. The higher accuracy given by the ANN can be proved both by lower mean error values (aveBw) and smaller variation ranges (aveBw Ã„Â… standard deviation Bw). In the case of the TEM, the aveBw values change from - 6. 9 % to - 5. 0 % {{and in the case of}} ANN from - 0. 8 % to 1. 8 %.

40|$|A incorporação de {{material}} orgânico associada à solarização do solo é uma técnica promissora no controle de patógenos de plantas. O trabalho consistiu na prospecção de materiais vegetais promissores na produção de voláteis fungitóxicos capazes de inviabilizar as estruturas de resistência de fitopatógenos do solo. Em condição de campo foram incorporados 3 Kg/m² de folhas e ramos de brócolos, eucalipto, mamona e mandioca brava, associada ou não à solarização, visando o controle de Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici raça 2; Macrophomina phaseolina; Rhizoctonia solani AG- 4 HGI e Sclerotium rolfsii. O controle foi avaliado por meio da sobrevivência das estruturas, em meios semi-seletivo específicos, aos 7, 14, 21 e 28 dias do início do experimento. Foram monitoradas as temperaturas do solo e do ar por um DataLogger Tipo CR 23 X (Campbell Scientific) e a porcentagem de CO 2 e de O 2 pelo equipamento analisador de gases (Testo 325 - 1). A associação da incorporação dos materiais vegetais com a solarização do solo inativou F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici raça 2, M. phaseolina e R. solani. O fungo S. rolfsii foi o único que não apresentou 100 % de controle com solarização mais mamona durante o período estudado.

30|$|The {{vegetable}} dyes {{are generally}} {{used for the}} coloration of the products in textile and fashion industries (For yarns, fabrics and garments), food industry (For sweets, confectionery and bakery products), and cosmetics industry (For soap, cream, powder, lipstick etc.). There is a big potential for using the vegetable dyes in textile industry due to one and only reason i.e. eco-friendliness of the product [1, 2]. Whole plant (e.g. weld/marigold), barks (e.g. oak/maple), leaves (e.g. tea/henna), seeds (e.g. annatto), roots (e.g. madder/blood root), semen shell (e.g. Persian nut), flowers (e.g. dahlia/gul mohar), rhizome (e.g. water lily), fruits (e.g. elder berries), fruit rinds (e.g. pomegranate) or, skin (e.g. onion) etc. can be the sources of vegetable dyes [3]. The use <b>of</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>materials</b> in textile coloration is a well-known way of utilizing renewable raw materials according to the technical and ecological requirements of the 21 st Century [4]. For this purpose, traditional dye plants have also been cultivated in many countries.

Many dyes can be easily available from garden waste. In many of the world’s developing countries, vegetable sources not only give final products with a great variety of shades but also the possibility of an income through sustainable harvest and sale of these plants [6]. Many of the vegetable dyes attract the most consumers with a special fragrance and many provide antibacterial and UV protective functions to fabrics [7, 8].|$|E
