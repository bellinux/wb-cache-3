30|$|Table 4 {{shows the}} real,reactive power losses and minimum {{voltages}} after {{the placement of}} different types of DGs. The optimal location for 15 bus test system is 6.

The losses are also lower with DG type III <b>operating</b> <b>at</b> 0.9 pf when compared to DG <b>operating</b> <b>at</b> upf in Table 4. This is due to both real and reactive powers are supplied by the DG at lagging pf. Reactive power is not supplied by type III DG when <b>operating</b> <b>at</b> Unity pf.

5|$|After {{the initial}} ESRO program was initiated, the agency moved towards {{satellites}} {{with a higher}} orbital eccentricity and escape orbits.

Because of the change of ESRO's focus, the need for a telemetry station on Svalbard disappeared after the termination of ESRO's initial program, and the facility was closed in 1974.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, plans {{had existed}} for an {{extensive}} rapid transit system, with an underground {{section in the}} city center.

Four-car trains would <b>operate</b> <b>at</b> ten-minute headways. The suggestion was discussed by the city council in 1973, but no decision was taken. As an alternative, expansion of the railway from Bergen to Eidsvåg, Åsane and Nesttun was proposed. Fast commuter trains could then be supplemented with buses.|$|E

5|$|In {{order for}} the Tornado to perform well as a {{low-level}} supersonic strike aircraft, it was considered necessary for it to possess good high-speed and low-speed flight characteristics. To achieve high-speed performance, a swept or delta wing is typically adopted, but these wing designs are inefficient at low speeds. To <b>operate</b> <b>at</b> both high and low speeds with great effectiveness, the Tornado uses a variable-sweep wing. This approach had been adopted by earlier aircraft, such as the American General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark strike fighter, and the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 fighter. The F-111 has many similarities with the smaller Tornado; however, the Tornado differs in being a multi-role aircraft with more advanced onboard systems and avionics.|$|E
