When the trigger is pulled, the bolt is driven forward by the recoil springs, {{stripping}} a round from the feed lips of the magazine and guiding the round into the chamber. The bolt then continues forward and the firing pin strikes the cartridge primer, igniting the round, resulting in a high-pressure impulse, forcing the bolt back against the resistance of the recoil springs and the inertial mass of the bolt. By the time the bolt and empty casing have moved far enough to the rear to open the chamber, the bullet has left the barrel and pressure in the barrel has dropped to a safe level. The M3's comparatively low cyclic rate was a function of the relatively low pressure generated by the [...]45 ACP round, a heavy bolt, and recoil springs with a lighter-than-normal compression rate.|$|E

30|$|The most {{important}} challenge in designing a robust specification-based IDS {{is creating a}} formalism that captures the valid <b>operating</b> <b>sequences</b> of the system. Therefore, the cost of defining the specification “trace policy” {{and the difficulty of}} evaluating and verifying the specifications limit the real-world applicability of specification-based IDSs. A specification-based IDS learns the root characteristics of attacks and detects known attacks like a misuse-based IDS, and it also has the ability of anomaly-based IDSs to detect unknown attacks, such as <b>operating</b> <b>sequences</b> that are not included in the normal behavior of the system [82 – 84].|$|R

In this system man and robot are working together in the same assembly station without safety constructions which separate them. The appearing question is how this 'cooperation-cell' should be planned: What is the best allocation of the assembly processes to man and robot? How can be decided which processes should be done by whom and when? What is the optimised <b>operating</b> <b>sequence?</b> In this thesis a method and a software tool have been developed for the planning of an <b>operating</b> <b>sequence</b> for a cooperation-cell which is optimised in terms of skills of humans, technical skills of robots and the cycle time. The target of the developed method is a skill oriented, multi criteria planning of an <b>operating</b> <b>sequence.</b> The method has been integrated into a software tool which enables the planner of assembly systems to schedule the assembly processes and distribute them among robot and human according to their skills and with an optimised cycle time. The developed method comprises two parts. In the first part, two so called 'skill levels' are calculated for each assembly process: One for the man and one for the robot. These 'skill levels' are quantitative factors which determine the suitability for performing the assembly process by a robot or by a human.

Strains and hydro-gen charging of samples give the formation of hy-drogen traps with different binding energies. Bind-ing energies and quantity of hydrogen entrapped in traps depend both on specific elongations at strain, and an <b>operating</b> <b>sequence</b> "strain-charging".

40|$|ABSTRACT. Irrigation {{application}} duration is {{an important}} factor influencing surface irrigation efficiency. Most methods of semiautomatic timing and control use mechanical timers for (1) direct gate release by the timer, and (2) timers designed for use with electrical components such as solenoid or electric motor-actuated releases. A trip-cord gate release system and water sensors were also used to semiautomate irrigation. The trip-cord system uses the energy of an opening or closing gate to either open or close other gates in the <b>operating</b> <b>sequence.</b> Semiautomatic gates, described in articles I and II of this series, and their associated controls were tested on a basin and three border irrigation systems on two farms during a five-year period.
