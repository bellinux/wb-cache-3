5000|$|The League {{organised}} open-air {{meetings at}} Vicar's Croft which Maguire and others spoke at, {{and it was}} from these that they made contact with building workers whom Maguire helped organise a successful strike in 1889 for a wage increase.

After the Socialist League split, Maguire joined the Independent Labour Party and attended its founding conference at Bradford in 1893.|$|R
25|$|This {{corner is}} also the former site of the country's longest-serving <b>gasworks,</b> <b>which</b> {{operated}} from 1863 to 1987, and a small industrial museum, the Dunedin Gasworks Museum, {{is located on the}} southern part of its site on Braemar Street. Opened to the public in 2001, this museum is one of only three known preserved gasworks museums in the world. The museum features five steam pumping engines which were used in the gasworks, and an older engine imported from Scotland in 1868. Three of the buildings within the Gasworks complex have NZHPT classifications: the skeleton of the 1879 gasometer, the exhauster and boiler house, and the fitting shop (all Category I).|$|R
50|$|A {{property}} boom {{begun in}} the 1970s coupled {{with the advent of}} oil-fuelled processing of North Sea oil led to a process of Gentrification with offices and studio businesses and flats on the market for prices more customary in the centre of the capital. On the northern bank of the Thames there is Hurlingham Retail Park, which includes an electrical retailer and tile stores. There is also a business enterprise centre in the Sulivan district. Across the other side of Townmead Road there is a very large food and home wares supermarket, and Imperial Wharf, a brownfield development of the former Imperial <b>Gasworks</b> <b>which</b> is growing to include a mixture of affordable housing, both private and public, shops, a park and a new railway station.|$|R
50|$|In {{terms of}} goods exported, the station relied mainly on its {{agricultural}} hinterland, with {{the transport of}} livestock, milk, potatoes, sawn timber, oats and most importantly casks of whisky from the nearby Glen Garioch distillery. This institution was also to provide regular traffic inwards with the carriage of coal and barley for the malting process. It is reported that {{the handling of the}} coal brought its own problems. In winter, after a hard frost, it had to be loosened with a pick-axe before it could be unloaded from the wagons, whilst in summer it had to be sprinkled with water to counter the “stew” (dust). The other main commodities imported to Oldmeldrum were cattle feed, fertilisers and cereal seed, as well as coal for home fires and for the Oldmeldrum <b>gasworks</b> (<b>which</b> supplied the lighting for the station building).|$|R

It has been in operation since 1999 and is situated in the city's former <b>gasworks</b> <b>which</b> were founded in 1857, occupying an area of about 30.000 m2.

50|$|An {{attempt in}} 1633 to {{establish}} saltpetre works at Matching Green {{was defeated by}} local opposition. A belt of land southeast from Down Hall has been exploited for brickmaking. In 1843 Brick Kiln mead and further Brick Kiln field lay near Down Hall. Farther south were Brick Kiln field, and Brick House Farm. In 1897 brickworks were in the field immediately west of Brick Kiln mead probably supplied with gas by the Down Hall <b>gasworks,</b> <b>which</b> stood in the adjoining field. There were maltings in the mid 18th century at Smallways Farm, Newman's End. Malthouse field in 1843 lay west of the farm. Maltings at Matching Green operated from 1845 or earlier and stood north of Albion House, and in 1902 occupied half an acre. Potash making is indicated by the field names Potash Mead and Potash Pasture, recorded in 1843 north of the lane leading to Brick House. Potash Road runs east from Matching Green.|$|R
50|$|For over 100 {{years the}} {{peninsula}} {{was dominated by}} the <b>gasworks</b> <b>which</b> primarily produced town gas, also known as coal gas. The gasworks grew to 240 acre, the largest in Europe, also producing coke, tar and chemicals as important secondary products. The site had its own extensive railway system connected to the main railway line near Charlton, and a large jetty used to unload coal and load coke. There were two huge gas holders, of 8.6 and 12.2 million ft3 (240,000m3 and 345,000m3). The larger holder, originally {{the largest in the}} world, was reduced to 8.9 million ft3 (250,000m3) when it was damaged in the Silvertown explosion in 1917, but was still the largest in England until it was damaged again by a Provisional Irish Republican Army bomb in 1978. Originally manufacturing gas from coal, the plant began to manufacture gas from oil in the 1960s. Its peak production of 400 million ft3 per day (11.3 million m3) in the mid 1960s {{is believed to have been}} the largest of any single site in the world. The discovery of natural gas reserves in the North Sea soon rendered the complex obsolete.|$|R
5000|$|After officially leaving {{politics}} Broge remained {{active in}} local matters.

While the city council started working on establishing a public gas company instead Hans Broge boarded the same ship as the English negotiator and en route to England bought the gasworks. Subsequently he offered the gasworks to the city council for the same price or to run it personally. The city council accepted the offer and purchased it. In 1880 a dispute over unpaid taxes erupted between Broge and the city council. On 5 May 1881 the city council received a letter from Broge stating that the condition for paying the disputed amount was that two projects had to be realized. One was the construction of Sct. Clement's Bridge over the Aarhus River by Sct. Clement's Cathedral and the other was a rail line to Odder. In exchange Broge agreed to pay the 14.000 Danish Kroner in taxes along with a donation of 10.000 for the construction of the bridge. The city council accepted his offer and both bridge and rail line was inaugurated in 1884, ...|$|R
5000|$|In Aalen, {{industrialisation}} {{was a slow}} process. The {{first major}} increase was in the 1840s, when three factories for nails and some other factories emerged. It was the link with the railway network, by {{the opening of the}} Rems Railway from Cannstatt to Wasseralfingen in 1861, that brought more industry to Aalen, along with the royal steel mill (later Schwäbische Hüttenwerke) in Wasseralfingen. The Rems Railway's extension to Nördlingen in 1863, the opening of the Brenz Railway in 1864 and of the Upper Jagst Railway in 1866 turned Aalen into a railway hub. Furthermore, between 1901 and its shutdown in 1972, the Härtsfeld Railway connected Aalen with Dillingen an der Donau via Neresheim. Part of becoming a rail hub entailed more jobs based on the rail industry. These included, a maintenance facility, a roundhouse, an administrative office, two track maintenance shops, and a freight station with an industrial branch line. This helped shape Aalen into what today's historians call a [...] "railwayman's town". Starting in 1866, the utilities in town all began to be upgraded. Starting with the Aalen <b>gasworks</b> <b>which</b> were opened and gas lighting was introduced. Then in 1870, a modern water supply system was started and in 1912 the mains electricity. Finally, in 1935, the first electrically powered street lights were installed.|$|R
5000|$|The new Dunstable station had two {{platforms}} and a bay; the Down platform {{was used by}} [...] trains (the extension from Luton to Hatfield was completed in 1860), the bay was used for Leighton services and the Up platform was, it is believed, used as a run-round loop. The site of the original Dunstable station became the goods yard. This yard saw large quantities of coal and fertiliser traffic, in addition to general traffic. To {{the south of the}} yard lay the town's <b>gasworks</b> <b>which</b> were served by sidings, whilst to the west was a signal box which controlled access to the yard as well as the level crossing over Brewer's Hill Road. A rail-served Bedfordshire County Council depot was situated {{on the other side of}} the level crossing immediately to the north of the running lines. Other sidings served Waterlow's printing works, the Great Northern coal yard from 1871, and the Associated Portland Cement works at Houghton Regis from 1925. Due to subsidence a new 50-lever signal box replaced the LNWR one from 16 August 1958; it was only to have a short life as closure came just over a decade later on 23 March 1969. At this time the station was still lit by gas lamps.|$|R
