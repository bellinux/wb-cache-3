The {{measurement of the}} small but non-zero energy dissipation of a droplet moving on such a surface is not feasible with the contemporary methods, although it would be needed for optimized technological applications related to dirt repellency, microfluidics and functional surfaces.

Two dissipative forces are identified at a precision of ~ 10 nN, one related to contact angle hysteresis near the three-phase contact line and the other to viscous dissipation near the droplet–solid interface.

During the measurement, each axis is controlled numerically. The numerical control parameter is calculated in advance from the ideal shape of the sample. We detect the gap in the normal vector for the figure error using QPD because the sample has a figure error. Therefore, we can acquire the declination of the normal vectors from the QPD output signal.|$|R

The Cook and Torrance (CT) bidirectional reflectance distribution function model was adapted to account for this distinctive feature. The resulting ACT (Anisotropic Cook and Torrance) model {{is based on the}} decomposition of the roughness parameter into two perpendicular components. It is evaluated on sorghum (Sorghum halepense) and wheat (Triticum durum) leaf BRF (Bidirectional Reflectance Factor) measurements acquired using a conoscope system. Results show that the ACT model fits the measurements better than azimuthally isotropic surface models: the root mean square error computed over all the BRF measurements for both leaves decreases from ≈ 0. 06 for the Lambertian model to ≈ 0. 04 for the CT model and down to ≈ 0. 03 for the ACT model. The adjusted value of the refraction index is plausible (n ≈ 1. 32) for both leaves while the retrieved roughness values perpendicular to the veins (sorghum = 0. 56; wheat = 0. 46) is about two times larger than that parallel to the veins (sorghum = 0. 27; wheat = 0. 18). Nonetheless, the observed residual discrepancies between the ACT model simulations and the measurements may be explained mainly by the Lambertian assumption of the volume scattering...|$|R

The use of {{nanotechnology}} {{is rapidly}} growing in various fields for different {{applications such as}} aerospace, electronics, construction, biomedicine, cosmetics etc. Nanomaterials posses unique size dependent material properties and can manipulate the host material properties {{to a greater extent}} compared to the micron sized particles of the same composition, and make them suit the requirements. Various kinds of nanomaterials with different size and shapes such as particulate, fibrous, layered, tube and foam when added to the host matrix material in composites will tailor the properties of the matrix material to a greater extent making nanocomposites a good alternative to conventional composites. In this research, more emphasis is made on improving mechanical and other physical properties of recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) polymer by adding graphene nanoplatelets at different concentrations. Recycled HDPE graphene nanocomposites were prepared using a solvent method assisted by a sonication method where samples are processed in to dog bone shaped specimens by using an injection molding process. For comparision, samples of plain recycled HDPE without graphene nanoplatelets were prepared. The samples were tested to evaluate the improvement in physical properties as function of the graphene concentrations in the polymer matrix. Physical properties of these samples were determined using different techniques: a) thermal conductivity which is found by using axial flow comparative cut bar method, b) dielectric constant is found by measuring capacitance of parallel plate capacitor setup using a capacitance bridge, c) water contact angle is found by <b>optical</b> angle <b>goniometer,</b> and d) tensile modulus is found by uniaxial tensile testing. The morphological characterization of PMN samples is performed using SEM technique to observe the type of distribution and dispersion of graphene nanoplatelets in the polymer matrix. The test results showed that adding graphene into recycled matrix drastically changed the physical properties of the materials. This may improve the value of the recycled materials for various applications...|$|R

40|$|Summary. The {{theory of}} a new method for the {{determination}} f reflectivity at truly normal incidence is described. A parallel light beam falls on the specimen after passing through a glass cube with semi-silvered diagonal mounted at the centre of an <b>optical</b> <b>goniometer.</b> The various reflected beams are measured by a photo-multiplier fixed to the telescope of the goniometer. Experiment has proved {{the validity of the}} method and the spectral refleetivity of pyrite in air and in oil has been investigated. M EASUREMENTS of the reflectivity of opaque minerals for identification purposes are carried out by comparison with standards on which absolute measurements have been made. The available absolute methods are limited in number and suffer from two disadvantages. Firstly, the reflectivity at truly normal incidence is not determined but rather the reflectivity at angles of incidence up to 10 degrees. Secondly, it is not usually possible to determine the reflectivity of specimens in an immersion medium other than air. These disadvan-tages can apparently be overcome by a method based on the following fairly simple principles. In fig. 1, PP is a glass slip of reflectivity R (for oblique incidence) placed in a vertical plane at the centre of a horizontal-circle <b>optical</b> <b>goniometer,</b> at 45 ~ to a plane-polarized parallel light beam of intensity I s whose vibration direction is parallel {{to the surface of the}} glass slip so that no rotation of the plane of polarization will occur on reflection. The sur-face QQ of the specimen whose reflectivity S is to be determined is set up at right angles to the light beam. If a sensitive device for measuring light intensity is now attached to the goniometer telescope, the intensities I o SR(1 [...] R) and IoR can be measured. The specimen and glass slip are then removed and the intensity I o of the direct beam can be measured. R and S can then be calculated. The device for measuring intensity must b...|$|E

Especially, facets {{of a greater}} variety ofcrystallographic forms may occur that are otherwise hidden by theslowest growing faces which dominate the crystal’s morphology. We did asphere growth experiment with a decagonal Al(72) Co(9) Ni(19) quasicrystalprepared from a large single-grain sample formerly grown using theCzochralski method from an off-stoichiometric melt. By heating thepolished crystalline half-sphere to a temperature slightly higher thanits own growth temperature a thin liquid layer of self-flux formed. Apartial evaporation of Al being the solvent of this system causedre-crystallisation at {{the surface of the}} quasicrystalline sphere. Afterseveral times repeating this process at further increasing temperatures,tiny faces of four different crystallographic forms developed. By usingan <b>optical</b> <b>goniometer</b> and electron scanning microscopy indexing of thesefacets was possible. With the only exception of the decagonal prism 5100006 they had not been observed so far in contact to the melt.

40|$|A {{computational}} fluid dynamic (CFD) {{model was}} developed to describe the process performance of a semi-batch annular TiO 2 -UV photoreactor in an Eulerian framework. The model accounted for the optical behaviour of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) suspensions, the flow distribution and the oxalic acid degradation in the reactor. The scattering component of the optical model, explicitly included in the CFD simulations using a TiO 2 -specific scattering phase function integrated in the radiative transfer equation, was calibrated using an <b>optical</b> <b>goniometer</b> by comparing simulated scattering light profiles against irradiance measurements collected for various TiO 2 concentrations and UV wavelengths and subsequently solved by the discrete ordinate (DO) radiation model. Several scattering phase functions were tested against the goniometric measurements confirming that the Henyey-Greenstein (HG) equation was the most appropriate angular distribution function at 254 and 355 nm, irrespective of the TiO 2 concentration. Using the calibrated HG function, a new approach for quantifying the absolute values of absorption and scattering coefficients in TiO 2 suspensions was proposed. It consists of iteratively solving, using the DO model, the radiative transfer equation for various combinations of absorption and scattering coefficients until the error between observed and predicted angular irradiance measurements is minimized. The accuracy of the optical parameters was verified with independent CFD simulations carried out for an annular photoreactor and already available in the literature. Predicted and simulated irradiance and oxalic acid degradation data {{were found to be}} in excellent agreement, confirming the considerable potential of the integrated modelling approach presented in this paper for the design, optimization and scale-up of photocatalytic technologies for water and wastewater treatment applications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background A single {{session of}} {{isolated}} repetitive {{movements of the}} thumb can alter the response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), such that the related muscle twitch measured post-training occurs in the trained direction. This response is attributed to transient excitability changes in primary motor cortex (M 1) that form {{the early part of}} learning. We investigated; (1) whether this phenomenon might occur for movements at the wrist, and (2) how specific TMS activation patterns of opposing muscles underlie the practice-induced change in direction. Methods We used single-pulse suprathreshold TMS over the M 1 forearm area, to evoke wrist movements in 20 healthy subjects. We measured the preferential direction of the TMS-induced twitch in both the sagittal and coronal plane using an <b>optical</b> <b>goniometer</b> fixed to the dorsum of the wrist, and recorded electromyographic (EMG) activity from the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and extensor carpi radialis (ECR) muscles. Subjects performed gentle voluntary movements, in the direction opposite to the initial twitch for 5 minutes at 0. 2 Hz. We collected motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by TMS at baseline and for 10 minutes after training. Results Repetitive motor training was sufficient for TMS to evoke movements in the practiced direction opposite to the original twitch. For most subjects the effect of the newly-acquired direction was retained for at least 10 minutes before reverting to the original. Importantly, the direction change of the movement was associated with a significant decrease in MEP amplitude of the antagonist to the trained muscle, rather than an increase in MEP amplitude of the trained muscle.
