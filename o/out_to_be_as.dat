25|$|Although Burzynski and his {{associates}} claim success {{in the use of}} antineoplaston combinations for the treatment of various diseases, and some of the clinic's patients say they have been helped, {{there is no evidence of}} the clinical efficacy of these methods. The consensus among the professional community, as represented by the American Cancer Society and Cancer Research UK among others, is that antineoplaston therapy is unproven and the overall probability of the treatment turning <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> claimed is low due to lack of credible mechanisms and the poor state of research after more than 35 years of investigation. While the antineoplaston therapy is marketed as a non-toxic alternative to chemotherapy, it is a form of chemotherapy with significant known side effects including severe neurotoxicity.|$|E

Rolling Stone named it the second-best album in its year-end list, commenting that [...] "What could have been a crash-and-burn anticlimax turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> fun as any record in a dog's age. From the {{cinematic}} 'No Church in the Wild' to the Stax-soul update 'Otis,' Throne testifies to Kanye West's talent for beats both iconoclastic and pop-savvy." [...] Claire Suddath of Time ranked it number three on her top-10 albums list and called it [...] "a beautifully decadent album". Chris Richards of The Washington Post ranked it number two on his list and stated, [...] "Instead of blushing over their embarrassment of riches, pop's most intriguing partnership delivered a self-congratulatory opus that was adventurous enough to remind us that they're rap visionaries first, 1 percent bazillionaires second. The A.V. Club ranked the it number nine on its year-end list, commenting that [...] "Watch The Throne thrives on the bristling tension between Kanye's live-wire energy and rule-breaking abandon, and Jay-Z's innate cautiousness. It's an album of the moment—a point underlined by the presence of Frank Ocean on two tracks—yet it has the substance to endure." [...] Stereogum placed Watch the Throne at number 10 on its list of the [...] "Top 50 albums of 2011" [...] while Pitchfork Media placed the album at number 21 on its list. In 2012, Complex named the album one of the classic albums of the last decade.

500|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 2006–07 season, Joe Sakic and Milan Hejduk were the only two remaining members from the 2000–01 Stanley Cup-winning squad. Sakic was the only player left from the team's days in Quebec, though Hejduk was drafted by the Nordiques. Paul Stastny, son of Nordiques legend Peter Stastny, also provided a link to the franchise's past. Before the previous season's playoffs, in a move reminiscent of Patrick Roy's trade, the Avalanche traded goalie David Aebischer to the Montreal Canadiens for the Vezina Trophy-winning Jose Theodore. The move, however, would not turn <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> successful. Theodore posted a 13–15–1 record in 2006–07, with an [...]891 save percentage and 3.26 goals against average (GAA), with his US$6million salary becoming a heavy burden for the Avalanche in the salary cap era. The Avalanche missed the playoffs {{for the first time since}} 1993–94, when they were still in Quebec. The team had a 15–2–2 run in the last 19 games of the season to keep their playoffs hopes alive until the penultimate day of the season. A 4–2 loss against the Nashville Predators on April 7, with former Av Peter Forsberg assisting the game-winning goal scored by another former Av, Paul Kariya, knocked Colorado out of the playoff race. As consolation, the team won the last game of the season against the Calgary Flames the following day and finished fourth in the Northwest Division and ninth in the Western Conference with a 44–31–7 record for 95 points, one less than eighth-seeded Calgary. Nonetheless, the result was greater than expected by hockey pundits; Sports Illustrated previewed before the start of the season that the Avalanche would finish 13th in the Western Conference. During that last game of the season, Joe Sakic scored a goal and two assists and became the second-oldest player in NHL history to reach 100 points, behind only Gordie Howe, who had 103 points at age 40 in the 1968–69 season. During the season, Paul Stastny set an NHL record for longest point streak by a rookie, with 20 games, three more than the previous record, held by Teemu Selanne and Karlis Skrastins set a new NHL record for the longest game streak by a defenseman, with 495 games. Until the Avalanche's 2006–07 season, no team in the history of the NHL had ever made it to 95 points without earning a spot in the playoffs. In the Eastern Conference, three teams progressed to the playoffs with fewer than 95 points: the New York Rangers (94), the Tampa Bay Lightning (93) and the New York Islanders (92).|$|E

2500|$|Craig Raine, in {{his books}} In Defence of T. S. Eliot (2001) and T. S. Eliot (2006), sought to defend Eliot from {{the charge of}} anti-Semitism. Reviewing the 2006 book, Paul Dean stated {{that he was not}} {{convinced}} by Raine's argument. Nevertheless, he concluded, [...] "Ultimately, as both Raine and, to do him justice, Julius insist, however much Eliot may have been compromised as a person, as we all are in our several ways, his greatness as a poet remains." [...] In another review of Raine's 2006 book, the literary critic Terry Eagleton also questioned the validity of Raine's defence of Eliot's character flaws as well as the entire basis for Raine's book, writing, [...] "Why do critics feel a need to defend the authors they write on, like doting parents deaf to all criticism of their obnoxious children? Eliot's well-earned reputation [...] is established beyond all doubt, and making him <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> unflawed as the Archangel Gabriel does him no favours." ...|$|E

2500|$|Remarkably, this match turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> {{exciting}} {{as the previous}} one had been.

When he came to the wicket, England were 48/5, and scoring the 263 that they needed to win seemed far beyond them. Saunders had taken four of the wickets. Jessop's previous highest Test score was only 55, but now he reached his hundred off just 76 balls, after an uncertain start when he gave two chances with his score in the twenties. He and Jackson added 109, before Jackson was out for 49 to make the score 157/6. Hirst helped him take the score to 187 before Jessop himself was out. Wisden said of his innings: All things considered a more astonishing display has never been seen. What he did would have been scarcely possible under the same circumstances to any other living batsmen.|$|E

2500|$|On October 13, 2000 El Oriental {{defeated}} Super Crazy {{to win the}} UWA World Welterweight Championship, {{his first}} AAA promoted championship ever. He held the title until early 2001 when {{he was forced to}} vacate the title after being injured during a match. After recovering from his injury El Oriental participated in the 2002 Rey de Reyes tournament, but was eliminated by Cibernético in the opening round. At Triplemania X he was one of six wrestlers who participated in the main event. Each of the six wrestlers bet the hair of a referee on the outcome of the match. El Oriental represented referee Hijo del Tirantes in the match, but was not involved in the finish of the match as Heavy Metal pinned Sangre Chicana. Between late 2002 and mid-2003 El Oriental suffered various injuries that kept him out of the ring for long stretches of time. At the 2003 Guerra de Titanes Cynthia Moreno, El Oriental, Mascarita Sagrada and Pimpinela Escarlata defeated Faby Apache, Gran Apache, Mini Abismo Negro and Polvo de Estrellas in a Relevos Atómicos de locura match (Spanish for [...] "Eight-man madness match"), a match that featured two teams of four, each composed of a male wrestler, a female wrestler, an Exotico wrestler and a Mini-Estrella In the mid-2004 El Oriental's sister Cynthia started a storyline feud with the Apache family, primarily Faby Apache and Gran Apache that would last until 2009. On August 1, 2004 Cynthia and El Oriéntal unsuccessfully challenged for the AAA World Mixed Tag Team Championship, losing to Gran Apache and Faby Apache. The teams would subsequently clash on several occasions, with the Apaches managing to retain the mixed titles each time. In 2005 the Apaches were forced to vacate the Mixed tag team titles, after which AAA held a tournament to crown new champions. Cynthia and El Oriéntal defeated Gran Apache and Tiffany in the semi-final and then defeated Chessman and La Diabólica in a one night tournament at Verano de Escandalo to become the new AAA World Mixed Tag Team Champions. Over the next 779 days Cynthia and El Oriéntal would repeatedly defend the Mixed tag team titles, including defending them on various independent shows. Their reign would come to an end in November, 2007 when they were forced to vacate the championship when Cynthia suffered an injury and was unable to defend the titles. While Cynthia was recuperating from an injury Gran Apache and Mari Apache won the vacant title as well as turning técnicos (good guys) in the process. When Cynthia returned to the ring she and her brother turned rudo (bad guy) when they attacked Gran and Mari Apache after a successful title defense. At the 2008 Verano de Escandalo Oriental and Cynthia Apache regained the AAA World Mix Tag Team Championship from the Apaches, making them the only team to have held the title twice. The Dinastia Moreno's second reign with the tag team titles turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> active as their first, in fact El Oriental once claimed they defended the titles around 150 times, although records do not support such a claim. In mid-2009 Cynthia began appearing less and less on AAA shows, leaving El Oriental free to team up with Kenzo Suzuki and Sugi San to form a trio called La Yakuza, after the Japanese Mafia. The team started out with a series of victories, but were defeated by Los Psycho Circus at the 2009 Verano de Escandalo. Following the event Sugi San left AAA and La Yakuza disbanded. In the fall of 2009 both Cynthia and El Oriéntal left AAA, losing the Mixed Tag Team title to Faby Apache and Aero Star as their last match for AAA.|$|E
