40|$|This article {{introduces}} volume leases as {{a mechanism}} for providing server-driven cache consistency for large-scale, geographically distributed networks. Volume leases retain the good performance, fault tolerance, and server scalability of the semantically weaker client-driven protocols that are now used on the web. Volume leases are a variation of <b>object</b> <b>leases,</b> which were originally designed for distributed file systems. However, whereas traditional <b>object</b> <b>leases</b> amortize overheads over long lease periods, volume leases exploit spatial locality to amortize overheads across multiple objects in a volume. This approach allows systems to maintain good write performance even {{in the presence of}} failures. Using trace-driven simulation, we compare three volume lease algorithms against four existing cache consistency algorithms and show that our new algorithms provide strong consistency while maintaining scalability and fault-tolerance. For a trace-based workload of web accesses, we find that volumes can reduce message traffic at servers by 40 % compared to a standard lease algorithm, and that volumes can considerably reduce the peak load at servers when popular objects are modified. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In mobile ad hoc {{networks}} (MANETs) many partial failures are {{the result}} of temporary network partitions due to the intermittent connectivity of mobile devices. Some of these failures will be permanent and require application-level failure handling. However, it is impossible to distinguish a permanent from a transient failure. Leasing provides a solution to this problem based on the temporal restriction of resources. But to date no leasing model has been designed specifically for MANETs. In this paper, we identify three characteristics required for a leasing model to be usable in a MANET, discuss the issues with existing leasing models and then propose the <b>leased</b> <b>object</b> references model, which integrates <b>leasing</b> with remote <b>object</b> references. In addition, we describe an implementation of the model in the programming language AmbientTalk. <b>Leased</b> <b>object</b> references provide an extensible framework that allows programmers to express their own leasing patterns and enables both lease holders (clients) and lease grantors (services) to deal with permanent failures.

It isn’t now situation for credit, which belonged to the classical external finance sources for many years ago. However leasing has been obtaining its position during the last ten years. Recently some important regulations concerning leasing were arranged in Poland and it would let leasing to develop further. With its development a new type of risk has appeared, i. e. a leasing risk. This article refers to the mortgage as the way to secure the leasing receivables of a leasing company. It is the similiar situation {{as in the case of}} other finance companies, for example bank and because of that this article has in the majority an universal character. However the leasing risk differs from the credit risk in some points. The most important point is the risk connected with the <b>leasing</b> <b>object</b> which a <b>leasing</b> company owns. It means among other things the buy risk which includes the price and undelivery risk. In case o f heavy and big machines and especially in case of technological lines the property they are installed and run play an significant part. Those can only be used in places they are installed without losing their value. Because of that the mortgage on the property secure not only the leasing receivables but the <b>leasing</b> <b>object</b> installed inside as well. The mortgage on the property can play the double part in case of leasing. For the efficiency of the second part is however the quickly execution process necessary.

40|$|The article {{determines that}} {{without regard to}} {{research}} and suggestions of many foreign and domestic scientists who study {{the issue of the}} size of the state sector and the national estate administration, in Ukraine the effective model of state sector is not formed. As a result the country has no valid system of control of estate administration. As the existing system of management shows, the regulative functions of the state in the field of property are performed by a number of different state institutions. Though the world experience demonstrates, that it is more reasonable to deal with such matters by a unique authorized body. The article determines a number of problems related to the development of the estate administration and gives suggestions for solving the problems. Having analysed the estate system of control it is possible to draw a conclusion, that the state pattern of ownership has low efficiency. In today's terms privatization exists not only as a process of changing the proprietor but also as a separate source of receipt of funds to the state budget which enables the state to conduct certain social programs. But lately the privatization process has been complicated by the legislative innovations, namely by the necessity of privatization of the premises together with the land. Taking into account the duration of land estimation, it prolongs the procedure of privatization considerably and in addition increases the cost of the object. It should be noticed that for some time past lease, which is also one of the sources of inpayments to the state budget, has come forward as a widespread method of estate administration. Although in terms of financial crisis the demand on the <b>objects</b> of <b>lease</b> of public domain diminishes and the tendency of decrease of the market property <b>objects</b> of <b>lease</b> grows. It is therefore necessary to pay attention to the market calls and stimulate subjects of leasing relations at legislative level.

To address this issue, we integrate memory management based on leasing directly into the remote object reference abstraction, leading to the concept of a <b>leased</b> <b>object</b> reference.

We show that leases, which leave the country of origin in charge of future recontracting, are optimal mechanisms for resolving adverse selection, {{and that they have}} good properties for addressing corruption. Option contracts deliver more revenue now and are therefore useful for reducing credit constraints.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel mechanism to perform intercession (a form of reflection) in an objectoriented programming language {{with the goal}} of making the language extensible from within itself. The proposed mechanism builds upon a mirror-based architecture, leading to a reusable reflective API that cleanly separates interface from implementation details. However, support for intercession has been limited in contemporary mirror-based architectures. This {{is due to the fact}} that mirror-based architectures only support reflection explicitly triggered by metaprograms, while intercession requires reflection implicitly triggered by the language interpreter. This work reconciles mirrors with intercession in the context of an actor-based, object-oriented programming language named AmbientTalk. We describe this language’s full reflective architecture, highlighting its novel mirror-based approach to reflect upon both objects and concurrently executing actors. Subsequently, we apply AmbientTalk’s mirror-based reflection to implement two language features which crucially depend on intercession, to wit future-type message passing and <b>leased</b> <b>object</b> references.

The possibility of adjusting to the current needs is of a significant practical value, {{but at the same}} time it poses a substantial difficulty in defining the constituent features of a financial lease.

The results of the analysis allowed a statement that the question of the essence of a financial lease consists in considerations regarding the nature of the relations between the purchase price of the object, its market value, the amount of rent payable, and the selling price. The determination of the economically sound, or cost efficient configuration of the above parameters has become a tool used in the revision of opinions on the concept of a capital instalment as a criterion used to classify different types of lease.
