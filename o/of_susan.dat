John Turturro was approached to portray John Laroche. Cooper strongly considered turning down Laroche, but accepted it after his wife urged him to. Albert Finney, Christopher Plummer, Terence Stamp and Michael Caine were considered for the role of Robert McKee, but McKee personally suggested Brian Cox to filmmakers.|$|E
5|$|When Sherwood's {{father died}} in 1795, her family retired from its active social life, since her mother {{preferred}} seclusion, and moved to Bridgnorth, Shropshire. At Bridgnorth Sherwood began writing sentimental novels; in 1802 she sold Margarita for £40 to Mr. Hazard of Bath, and The History <b>of</b> <b>Susan</b> Grey, a Pamela-like novel, for £10.

5|$|After the 1982 Tylenol murders, new FDA {{regulations}} {{went into}} effect which made it a federal - rather than just a state or local - crime to tamper with consumer products. Local and state authorities are not, however, prevented from also filing charges in such cases. Under this law, Nickell's crime was prosecutable as a federal product tampering case {{as well as a}} state murder case, and she was convicted not of murder, but of product tampering that caused death. The possibility of state charges for the actual murders <b>of</b> <b>Susan</b> Snow and Bruce Nickell continues to exist.|$|E
5|$|Flood was They Might Be Giants' first {{release on}} any major label. Elektra Records {{approached}} the band following the unexpected {{success of their}} second album, Lincoln, which was released on the independent Bar/None label. The record deal that Elektra presented was {{largely due to the}} work <b>of</b> <b>Susan</b> Drew, an A worker who had been following the band since 1986. Because of her confidence, the band was given an extensive level of creative control over their projects, in addition to the ability {{to take advantage of the}} label's strategies and resources. Although They Might Be Giants recorded the album as a duo, they were joined by many guest musicians on brass and string instruments. The band also enlisted Alan Bezozi to help program some of the drums for the album.|$|E
5|$|Her storylines {{have seen}} her begin a {{relationship}} with a Priest, being married, divorced and widowed. Susan has become a stepmother and a grandmother and she has been central to three plots revolving around health issues: Retrograde amnesia, Multiple sclerosis and Surrogacy. She has also been central to a cyber-bullying plot. In October 2009, Susan became the longest-running female character in the show's history, having been in Neighbours for over fifteen years. Woodburne has garnered various award nominations for her portrayal <b>of</b> <b>Susan</b> and the character has been well received by viewers and television critics.|$|E

5|$|Nearly a dozen new {{editions of}} Dickinson's poetry, whether {{containing}} previously unpublished or newly edited poems, were published between 1914 and 1945. Martha Dickinson Bianchi, the daughter <b>of</b> <b>Susan</b> and Edward Dickinson, published collections of her aunt's poetry {{based on the}} manuscripts held by her family, whereas Mabel Loomis Todd's daughter, Millicent Todd Bingham, published collections based on the manuscripts held by her mother. These competing editions of Dickinson's poetry, often differing in order and structure, ensured that the poet's work was in the public's eye.|$|E
5|$|Nichols was {{instructed}} to write the film for Hepburn, {{with whom he had}} worked on John Ford's Mary of Scotland in 1936. Barbara Leaming alleged that Ford had an affair with Hepburn, and claims that many of the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>Susan</b> and David were based on Hepburn and Ford. Nichols was in touch with Ford during the screenwriting, and the film included such members of the John Ford Stock Company as Ward Bond, Barry Fitzgerald, D'Arcy Corrigan and associate producer Cliff Reid. John Ford was a friend of Hawks, and visited the set. The round glasses Grant wears in the film are reminiscent of Harold Lloyd and of Ford.|$|E
5|$|On 5 April 1809, {{about three}} months before the family's move to Chawton, Austen wrote an angry letter to Richard Crosby, {{offering}} him a new manuscript <b>of</b> <b>Susan</b> if needed to secure the immediate publication of the novel, and requesting the return of the original so she could find another publisher. Crosby replied that he had not agreed to publish the book by any particular time, or at all, and that Austen could repurchase the manuscript for the £10 he had paid her and find another publisher. She did not have the resources to buy the copyright back at that time, but was able to purchase it in 1816.|$|E

5|$|The idea to do a film {{adaptation}} <b>of</b> <b>Susan</b> Orlean's The Orchid Thief {{dates back}} to 1994. Fox 2000 purchased the film rights in 1997, eventually selling them to Jonathan Demme, who set the project at Columbia Pictures. Charlie Kaufman was hired to write the script, but struggled with the adaptation and writer's block. Kaufman eventually created a script of his experience in adaptation, exaggerating events, and creating a fictional brother named Donald Kaufman. Kaufman put Donald Kaufman's name on the script and dedicated the film to the fictional character. By September 1999, Kaufman had written two drafts of the script; he turned in a third draft in November 2000.|$|E
5|$|The {{premise of}} a repentant murderer seeking {{to atone for}} their actions {{appears to have been}} based on the real-life case of Albert Fish, who practised severe self-harm after killing twelve-year-old Grace Budd. Fish would insert needles into his {{perineum}} and force rose stems along his urethra to be forcibly pulled out. However, the actual murders may have been inspired by the case <b>of</b> <b>Susan</b> Smith, a mother of two who drowned her children by sinking her car in a lake. Mention is also made in the episode of Arthur Shawcross, whose recidivism is cited by Garry's prosecutors as an example of why murder should warrant a death penalty. Shawcross was released from prison after serving a sentence for killing two children, only to kill eleven women while on parole.|$|E
5|$|Tolkien never {{expected}} his stories to become popular, but by sheer accident {{a book called}} The Hobbit, which he had written some years before for his own children, came in 1936 to the attention <b>of</b> <b>Susan</b> Dagnall, {{an employee of the}} London publishing firm George Allen & Unwin, who persuaded Tolkien to submit it for publication. When it was published a year later, the book attracted adult readers as well as children, and it became popular enough for the publishers to ask Tolkien to produce a sequel.|$|E

50|$|When Band <b>of</b> <b>Susans</b> {{formed in}} New York City in 1986, they {{consisted}} of Robert Poss (guitar and vocals), Susan Stenger (bass and vocals), Ron Spitzer (drums), with Susan Lyall (guitar), Susan Tallman (guitar), and Alva Rogers (vocals), and took their {{name from the}} trio <b>of</b> <b>Susans</b> then in the lineup. Poss, Stenger, and Spitzer grew up together in Buffalo, New York. After releasing their début album Hope Against Hope (1988), Rogers, Lyall and Tallman quit, and were replaced by Karen Haglof (guitar) and Page Hamilton (guitar). The new line-up recorded the band's second album, Love Agenda (1989), and a Peel Sessions EP that was not released until 1992, but the two new guitarists ultimately quit, with Haglof attending medical school and Hamilton quickly forming the more metal-influenced Helmet.|$|R
5|$|When Kathryn Trosper Popper died on March 6, 2016, {{at the age}} of 100 she was {{reported}} to be the last surviving actor to appear in Citizen Kane. Jean Forward, a soprano who dubbed the singing voice <b>of</b> <b>Susan</b> Alexander, was the last surviving performer from the film before her death in 2016. Warrick was the last surviving member of the principal cast {{at the time of her}} death in 2005. Sonny Bupp, who played Kane's young son, was the last surviving credited cast member of Citizen Kane when he died in 2007.|$|E
5|$|One {{source of}} {{opposition}} to the proposed amendment was the women's suffrage movement, which {{before and during the}} Civil War had made common cause with the abolitionist movement. However, {{with the passage of the}} Fourteenth Amendment, which had explicitly protected only male citizens in its second section, activists found the civil rights of women divorced from those of blacks. Matters came to a head with the proposal of the Fifteenth Amendment, which barred race discrimination but not gender discrimination in voter laws. After an acrimonious debate, the American Equal Rights Association, the nation's leading suffragist group, split into two rival organizations: the National Woman Suffrage Association <b>of</b> <b>Susan</b> B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who opposed the amendment, and the American Woman Suffrage Association of Lucy Stone and Henry Browne Blackwell, who supported it. The two groups remained divided until the 1890s.|$|E
