5|$|In 1848, German anatomist Johann Heinrich Meckel {{recorded}} black-brown pigment granules in {{the blood}} and spleen of a patient {{who had died in}} a mental hospital. Meckel was thought to have been looking at malaria parasites without realizing it; he did not mention malaria in his report. He hypothesized that the pigment was melanin. The causal relationship of pigment to the parasite was established in 1880, when French physician Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran, working in the military hospital of Constantine, Algeria, observed pigmented parasites inside the red blood cells of malaria sufferers. He witnessed the events of exflagellation and became convinced that the moving flagella were parasitic microorganisms. He noted that quinine removed the parasites from the blood. Laveran called this microscopic organism Oscillaria malariae and proposed that malaria was caused by this protozoan. This discovery remained controversial until the development of the <b>oil</b> <b>immersion</b> lens in 1884 and of superior staining methods in 1890–1891.|$|E

25|$|Fluorescence {{microscopy}} is {{a powerful}} technique to show specifically labeled structures within a complex environment and to provide three-dimensional information of biological structures. However, this information is blurred by the fact that, upon illumination, all fluorescently labeled structures emit light, irrespective of whether they are in focus or not. So {{an image of a}} certain structure is always blurred by the contribution of light from structures that are out of focus. This phenomenon results in a loss of contrast especially when using objectives with a high resolving power, typically <b>oil</b> <b>immersion</b> objectives with a high numerical aperture.|$|E

40|$|Background: Dermoscopy is {{a useful}} method that allows dermal and {{epidermal}} structures to be easily analysed non-invasively. Aim: In this study, <b>immersion</b> <b>oil,</b> which is widely used in dermoscopy, and ultrasound gel, which is less preferred, are evaluated comparatively in terms of displaying structural parameters and number of air bubbles in the image. Methods: A total of 71 nevomelanocytic or non-melanocytic pigmented lesions were taken up for this study. Structural characteristics of the obtained images were assessed by an experienced observer who scored the images in terms of color, pigment network, globule, vascular structure, number of air bubbles and other pigmentation parameters. Results: In the images obtained through <b>immersion</b> <b>oil</b> or ultrasound gel {{from all of the}} lesions, no statistical difference was found between the average values of air bubbles and in the evaluation of structural components (t = 1. 09, P = 0. 2). In the identification of pigment network in melanocytic lesions, <b>immersion</b> <b>oil</b> was observed to be more appropriate than ultrasound gel (t = 0. 01, P = 0. 02). Conclusions: Ultrasound gel may be preferred in the assessment of mucosa and nail bed lesions.

50|$|The maximum NA {{is limited}} by the {{refractive}} index of the medium between the lens and the sample. As with objective lenses, a condenser lens with a maximum numerical aperture of greater than 0.95 is designed to be used under <b>oil</b> <b>immersion</b> (or, more rarely, under water immersion), with a layer of immersion oil placed in contact with both the slide/coverslip and the lens of the condenser. An <b>oil</b> <b>immersion</b> condenser may typically have NA of up to 1.25. Without this oil layer, not only is maximum numerical aperture not realized, but the condenser mat not be able to precisely focus light on the object. Condensers with a numerical aperture of 0.95 or less are designed to be used without oil or other fluid on the top lens and are termed dry condensers. Dual dry/immersion condensers are basically <b>oil</b> <b>immersion</b> condensers that can nonetheless focus light with the same degree of precision even without oil between the top lens and the slide.|$|E

40|$|Since November 1997, 14 {{successive}} {{cases of}} {{occupational contact dermatitis}} were observed in 13 laboratory technicians and 1 physician, working in a genetics laboratory in Leuven (Belgium) in 3 laboratories of bacteriology in Strasbourg, Montbeliard and Angers, and in the laboratory of hematology in Bordeaux (France). The dermatitis, located on the hands, forearms and face, relapsed after each exposure to an <b>immersion</b> <b>oil</b> for microscopy. Patch tests performed in 10 patients were positive to epoxy resin (ER) in the European standard series (10 / 10 patients) and to newly formulated Leica <b>immersion</b> <b>oil</b> (7 / 7), 1 patient testing negatively with the former oil. A breakdown performed in 2 patients with the oil's ingredients confirmed sensitization to liquid modified ER components, contained at > 80 % concentration in the oil.

40|$|Extraordinary optical {{transmission}} (EOT) through arrays of gold nanoholes was studied with light across the {{visible to the}} near-infrared spectrum.

The geometrical shape and separation of the holes in these pairs of nanoholes affected the intensity of the transmission and the wavelength of resonance.

The performance of bridged nanohole pairs as a plasmonic sensor was investigated.

50|$|Before the {{development}} of synthetic <b>immersion</b> <b>oils</b> in the 1940s, cedar tree oil was widely used. Cedar oil has an index of refraction of approximately 1.516. The numerical aperture of cedar tree oil objectives is generally around 1.3. Cedar oil {{has a number of}} disadvantages however: it absorbs blue and ultraviolet light, yellows with age, has sufficient acidity to potentially damage objectives with repeated use (by attacking the cement used to join lenses), and diluting it with solvent changes its viscosity (and refraction index and dispersion). Cedar oil must be removed from the objective immediately after use before it can harden, since removing hardened cedar oil can damage the lens. In modern microscopy synthetic <b>immersion</b> <b>oils</b> are more commonly used, as they eliminate most of these problems. NA values of 1.6 can be achieved with different oils. Unlike natural oils synthetic ones do not harden on the lens and can typically be left on the objective for months at a time.|$|R
50|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>immersion</b> {{objectives}} {{can have}} practical difficulties {{due to their}} shallow depth of field and extremely short working distance, which calls {{for the use of}} very thin (0.17 mm) cover slips, or, in an inverted microscope, thin glass-bottomed Petri dishes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>immersion</b> can {{generally}} {{only be used}} on rigidly mounted specimens {{otherwise the}} surface tension of the oil can move the coverslip and so move the sample underneath. This can also happen on inverted microscopes because the coverslip is below the slide.|$|E
