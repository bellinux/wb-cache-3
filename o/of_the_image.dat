40|$|In {{order to}} remove the haze in natural {{disaster}} remote sensing images, an approach based on dark channel and hazy image degradation model was presented, which could remove the haze by using guided filter. Firstly, images of natural disaster were divided into fog area and mist area by threshd, and different methods were used to obtain <b>the</b> dark channel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>images.</b> Then, guided filter was used to optimize the transmmission map, and <b>the</b> contrast <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> was stretched to improve <b>the</b> dynamic range <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>images.</b> A series <b>of</b> natural disaster remote sensing images were chosen to test <b>the</b> alogrithm <b>of</b> haze removal. Finally, a series of evaluate parameters were proposed to assess the method. The result shows that the proposed algorithm can remove <b>the</b> haze <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>images,</b> improve <b>the</b> <b>image</b> quality, and enhance the color and detail <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>images,</b> so that <b>the</b> high-quality <b>images</b> can be obtained, which meet <b>the</b> requirements <b>of</b> haze removal for natural disaster remote sensing images to some extent. ©, 2015, Chinese Optical Society.

5|$|Once {{computational}} {{power was}} readily available, it became possible to easily design filters to minimise any arbitrary parameter, for example time delay or tolerance to component variation. The difficulties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> method were firmly {{put in the}} past, and even the need for prototypes became largely superfluous. Furthermore, the advent of active filters eased the computation difficulty because sections could be isolated and iterative processes were not then generally necessary.|$|E

5|$|Deleury {{suggests}} {{that although the}} temple may have {{been built in the}} 13th century, given the Hemadpanthi style architecture, the statue of Vithoba is of an earlier style so may have been carved for an earlier, smaller shrine that existed in Pandharpur.
