5|$|After the action, {{one of the}} English privateers quarrelled {{with one}} of his French shipmates and stabbed him in the back, killing him. Before a riot between the French and English sailors could begin, Morgan arrested the English sailor, and promised the French sailors that the man would be hanged on his return to Port Royal. Morgan kept his word and the sailor was hanged. After {{dividing}} the spoils of the conquest of Puerto Principe, Morgan announced a plan to attack Porto Bello (now in modern-day Panama). The city was the third largest and strongest on the Spanish Main, and on one of the main routes of trade between the Spanish territories and Spain. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goods passing through its port, Porto Bello was protected by two castles in the harbour and another in the town. The 200 French privateers, unhappy with the division of the treasure and the murder of their countryman, left Morgan's service and returned to Tortuga. Morgan and his ships briefly landed at Port Royal before leaving for Porto Bello.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{properties}} of gravity at short distances should be somewhat independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cosmological constant, it is desirable to have {{a version of the}} AdS/CFT correspondence for positive cosmological constant. In 2001, Andrew Strominger introduced a version of the duality called the dS/CFT correspondence. This duality involves a model of spacetime called de Sitter space with a positive cosmological constant. Such a duality is interesting {{from the point of view}} of cosmology since many cosmologists believe that the very early universe was close to being de Sitter space. Our universe may also resemble de Sitter space in the distant future.|$|E

40|$|What {{is to be}} {{underlined}} in {{characterizing the}} Ricardo’s quantity theory, {{is that it is}} a theory <b>of</b> determination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> money in a particular situation where money, whatever the form may be, shall be prevented from freely entering or leaving circulation. For Ricardo, <b>the</b> regulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> money by its quantity is a particular case in which <b>the</b> adjustment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> market price to the natural price requires a long period <b>of</b> time. <b>The</b> quantitativist determination is not valid unconditionally, but only when <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> observation is shorter than that <b>of</b> this adjustment. <b>The</b> determination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> money is, in any case, barely linked to his theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> commodities.

She left the bulk of her estate, estimated to be worth £70million, including paintings, Fabergé eggs, jewellery, and horses, to her surviving daughter, Queen Elizabeth II. As property passing from monarch to monarch is exempt from Inheritance Tax, as is property passing from the consort of a former monarch to the current monarch, a tax liability estimated at £28million (40 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> estate) was not incurred.

5|$|The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis {{affected}} the economy, {{resulting in a}} lingering decline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peso and falls in the stock market. The extent it was affected initially was not as severe as that {{of some of its}} Asian neighbors. This was largely due to the fiscal conservatism of the government, {{partly as a result of}} decades of monitoring and fiscal supervision from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in comparison to the massive spending of its neighbors on the rapid acceleration of economic growth. There have been signs of progress since. In 2004, the economy experienced 6.4% GDP growth and 7.1% in 2007, its fastest pace of growth in three decades. Average annual GDP growth per capita for the period 1966–2007 still stands at 1.45% in comparison to an average of 5.96% for the East Asia and the Pacific region as a whole.

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} evidence {{propagation operations}} on influence diagrams and a concept <b>of</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> evidence, which measures <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> experimentation. Evidence propagation operations {{are critical for}} <b>the</b> computation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> evidence, general update and inference operations in normative expert systems {{which are based on}} the influence diagram (generalized Bayesian network) paradigm. <b>The</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> evidence allows us to compute directly an outcome sensitivity, a <b>value</b> <b>of</b> perfect information and a <b>value</b> <b>of</b> control which are used in decision analysis (<b>the</b> science <b>of</b> decision making under uncertainty).

5|$|The {{accuracy}} of the measured value of the Avogadro constant is currently limited by the uncertainty {{in the value of}} the Planck constant—a measure relating the energy of photons to their frequency. That relative standard uncertainty has been 50parts per billion (ppb) since 2006. By fixing the Avogadro constant, the practical effect of this proposal would be that the uncertainty in the mass of a 12C atom—and the magnitude of the kilogram—could be no better than the current 50ppb uncertainty in the Planck constant. Under this proposal, the magnitude of the kilogram would be subject to future refinement as improved measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Planck constant become available; electronic realizations of the kilogram would be recalibrated as required. Conversely, an electronic definition of the kilogram (see Electronic approaches, below), which would precisely fix the Planck constant, would continue to allow 83⅓ moles of 12C to have a mass of precisely one kilogram but the number of atoms comprising a mole (the Avogadro constant) would continue to be subject to future refinement.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} Detroit and Hull's army wounded American morale, and {{eliminated}} the main American {{force in the}} area as a threat, {{while at the same}} time boosting morale among his own forces. Brock took the American supplies at Detroit and used them for his own forces, particularly the ill-equipped militia. Under prize regulations, a substantial part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> captured military stores would accrue to him. (If he had lived longer, he could have settled his debts.) Brock valued the captured ordnance supplies at £30,000. Finally, the victory secured the support of Tecumseh and the other chiefs in his confederation, who took Brock's actions as both a sign of competence and a willingness to take action.|$|E
