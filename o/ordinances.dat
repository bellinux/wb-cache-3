5|$|By now the Ordainers {{had drawn}} up their <b>Ordinances</b> for reform and Edward had little {{political}} {{choice but to}} give way and accept them in October. The <b>Ordinances</b> of 1311 contained clauses limiting the King's right {{to go to war}} or to grant land without parliament's approval, giving parliament control over the royal administration, abolishing the system of prises, excluding the Frescobaldi bankers, and introducing a system to monitor the adherence to the <b>Ordinances.</b> In addition, the <b>Ordinances</b> exiled Gaveston once again, this time with instructions that he {{should not be allowed to}} live anywhere within Edward's lands, including Gascony and Ireland, and that he should be stripped of his titles. Edward retreated to his estates at Windsor and Kings Langley; Gaveston left England, possibly for northern France or Flanders.|$|E
5|$|In Smith's view, the {{opportunity}} to achieve exaltation extended to all humanity; those who died with no opportunity to accept saving <b>ordinances</b> could achieve exaltation by accepting them in the afterlife through <b>ordinances</b> performed on their behalf. Smith said that children who died in their innocence would be guaranteed to rise at the resurrection and receive exaltation. Apart from those who committed the eternal sin, Smith taught that even the wicked and disbelieving would achieve a degree of glory in the afterlife.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} of the city expanded slowly after the Louisiana Purchase, but expansion increased desire to incorporate St. Louis as a town, allowing it to create local <b>ordinances</b> without {{the approval of the}} territorial legislature. On November 27, 1809, the first Board of Trustees were elected. The Board passed slave codes, created a volunteer fire department, and created an overseer to improve street quality. To enforce town <b>ordinances,</b> the Board created the St. Louis Police Department, and a town jail was established in the fortifications built for the Battle of St. Louis.|$|E

5|$|After the fiasco of Bannockburn, the earls of Lancaster and Warwick {{saw their}} {{political}} influence increase, and they pressured Edward to re-implement the <b>Ordinances</b> of 1311. Lancaster became {{the head of}} the royal council in 1316, promising to take forward the <b>Ordinances</b> through a new reform commission, but he appears to have abandoned this role soon afterwards, partially because of disagreements with the other barons, and possibly because of ill-health. Lancaster refused to meet with Edward in parliament for the next two years, bringing effective governance to a standstill. This stymied any hopes for a fresh campaign into Scotland and raised fears of civil war. After much negotiation, once again involving the Earl of Pembroke, Edward and Lancaster finally agreed to the Treaty of Leake in August 1318, which pardoned Lancaster and his faction and established a new royal council, temporarily averting conflict.|$|E

5|$|Following Charan Singh's resignation, Reddy summoned Chandrashekhar and Jagjivan Ram to Rashtrapati Bhavan to {{look into}} the {{possibility}} of forming an alternate government. Reddy, convinced {{that they would not be}} able to form one, accepted Singh's advice and dissolved Lok Sabha, calling for a mid term election. Singh was asked to continue as the caretaker prime minister till a new government was sworn in after the election. Reddy's decision was met with angry denunciations and protests by members of the Janata Party who even threatened to have him impeached. Although heading a caretaker government, Singh proposed as many as seven <b>ordinances</b> on a broad range of matters from effecting changes in company law, providing state funding of elections and reservation of jobs for the backward classes. Reddy however refused to promulgate the <b>ordinances</b> arguing that such momentous changes could not be made by a caretaker government.|$|E

5|$|In {{supporting}} Calvin's {{proposals for}} reforms, {{the council of}} Geneva passed the Ordonnances ecclésiastiques (Ecclesiastical <b>Ordinances)</b> on 20 November 1541. The <b>ordinances</b> defined four orders of ministerial function: pastors to preach and to administer the sacraments; doctors to instruct believers in the faith; elders to provide discipline; and deacons {{to care for the}} poor and needy. They also called for the creation of the Consistoire (Consistory), an ecclesiastical court composed of the lay elders and the ministers. The city government retained the power to summon persons before the court, and the Consistory could judge only ecclesiastical matters having no civil jurisdiction. Originally, the court had the power to mete out sentences, with excommunication as its most severe penalty. The government contested this power and on 19 March 1543 the council decided that all sentencing would be carried out by the government.|$|E

Newsweek reported that a county government employee who had worked in her position for 15years had been fired. An openly gay aide to future U.S. senator Paula Hawkins had also been dismissed. Despite the success of the Dade County campaign, activists worked quietly in liberal towns of Aspen, Colorado, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, Iowa City, Iowa, Wichita, Kansas, and the very liberal Eugene, Oregon to pass gay rights <b>ordinances.</b>|$|E
