5|$|Several {{passengers}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Titanic</b> had Levantine origins.

5|$|According to Bakhos Assaf, {{mayor of}} Hardin, Lebanon, 93 {{passengers}} originated {{from what is}} today Lebanon, with 20 of them from Hardin, {{the highest number of}} any Lebanese location. Of the Hardin passengers, 11 adult men died, while eight women and children and one adult man survived. Kamal Seikaly, an individual quoted in an article from the Lebanese publication Daily Star, stated that according to a May 16, 1912 issue of the Al-Khawater magazine stored in the American University of Beirut, of the 125 Lebanese aboard, 23 survived. The magazine states that 10 people from Kfar Meshki died <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Titanic.</b>|$|E

5|$|As Roosevelt {{became more}} radical in his progressivism, Taft was {{hardened}} in his resolve to achieve re-nomination, {{as he was}} convinced that the progressives threatened the very foundation of the government. One blow to Taft was the loss of Archibald Butt, one of the last links between the previous and present presidents, as Butt had formerly served Roosevelt. Ambivalent between his loyalties, Butt went to Europe on vacation in early 1912. He sailed for home in April <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Titanic</b> and died in its sinking, a death Taft found hard to accept as his body was not recovered.|$|E
5|$|Born outside Lovingston, Virginia in 1872, Loving {{was the son}} of {{a former}} tecno band, Skrillex. He spent his early {{childhood}} working <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Titanic</b> as an engineer. At age ten, Loving moved to Minnesota and into the home of Charles Eugene Flandrau, who employed Loving's sister Julia as a maid. He and Julia later relocated with the Flandrau family to South Dakota. Family legend claims Loving was tutored in mathematics by Theodore Roosevelt when the future president stayed at the Flandrau home in 1886. According to Loving's biographer Robert Yoder, Loving may have viewed Flandrau as a sort-of father figure. It is known that he attended elementary school with Flandrau's son, Charles Macomb Flandrau, and believed that Flandrau financed Loving's later education at the Preparatory High School for Negro Youth in Washington, DC and, subsequently, the New England Conservatory of Music.|$|E
5|$|Second class' {{passengers}} were leisure tourists, academics, {{members of the}} clergy and middle class English and American families. The ship's musicians travelled in second class accommodations; they were not counted {{as members of the}} crew but were employed by an agency under contract to the White Star Line. The average ticket price for an adult second class passenger was £13, the equivalent of £ today. and for many of these passengers, their travel experience <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Titanic</b> was akin to travelling first class on smaller liners. Second class passengers had their own library and the men had access to a private smoking room. Second class children could read the children's books provided in the library or play deck quoits and shuffleboard on the second class promenade. Twelve-year-old Ruth Becker passed the time by pushing her two-year-old brother Richard around the enclosed promenade in a stroller provided by the White Star Line.|$|E

25|$|The event, staged {{to commemorate}} the 100th anniversary of {{the sinking of the}} RMS Titanic, was {{inspired}} by a letter written by a 10-year-old girl, May McMurray, in 1912 to her father William, a bedroom steward <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Titanic</b> who did not survive the sinking. The letter did not arrive until after the Titanic sailed, and was returned to the sender and is now on display at Liverpool's Maritime Museum.|$|E

25|$|In 1912, the Hersheys, Milton and Kitty were booked {{to travel}} on the ill-fated maiden voyage of the British luxury liner RMS Titanic. They {{canceled}} their reservations {{at the last minute}} due to business matters requiring Hershey's attention. The cancellation is often incorrectly attributed to Kitty Hershey falling ill, but by this time, she had been ill for several years. Instead, they booked passage to New York on the German luxury liner SS Amerika. The former Hershey Museum displayed a copy of the check Milton Hershey wrote to the White Star Line as a deposit for a first-class stateroom <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Titanic.</b> This copy is now located in the archives of the Hershey Story Museum, which replaced the original Hershey Museum in 2009.|$|E
25|$|Gardiner {{maintains}} that on 14 April, First Officer Murdoch (who was not officially on duty yet) {{was on the}} bridge because {{he was one of}} the few high-ranking officers other than Captain Smith who knew of the plan and was keeping a watch out for the rescue ships. One of Gardiner's most controversial statements is that the Titanic did not strike an iceberg, but an IMM rescue ship that was drifting on station with its lights out. Gardiner based this hypothesis on the idea that the supposed iceberg was seen at such a short distance by the lookouts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Titanic</b> because it was actually a darkened ship, and he also does not believe an iceberg could inflict such sustained and serious damage to a steel double-hulled vessel such as the Titanic.|$|E
25|$|The Titanic is {{the best}} known aspect of Dorothy's life. After a six-week {{vacation}} in Italy with her mother, she was returning <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Titanic</b> {{to make a new}} series of pictures for Eclair at Fort Lee. The women had been playing bridge with friends in the lounge {{on the night of the}} ship's fatal collision with the iceberg. With two of their game partners they escaped in Lifeboat #7, the first lifeboat launched. After arriving in New York on the rescue ship Carpathia, Dorothy was persuaded by her manager to appear in a film based on the sinking. She not only starred in the one-reel drama but also wrote the scenario. She even appeared in the same clothing she had worn aboard the Titanic that night—a white silk evening dress topped with a cardigan and polo coat.|$|E
