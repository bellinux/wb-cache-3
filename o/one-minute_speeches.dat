The United States House of Representatives unanimously passed a similar bill brought by the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, but the full body did not receive a chance to vote on it. The House of Representatives held {{a moment of silence}} themselves, and <b>one-minute</b> <b>speeches</b> were given on the House floor as well. Representative Eliot Engel, who cosponsored the resolution in support of a minute of silence, blamed the IOC's refusal on [...] "being political because frankly they’re afraid of offending some of the Arab nations." [...] However, Engel said, “If you have this fiction of fraternal bonds and commonality of feeling, then it's appropriate for the IOC to act without any politics whatsoever. The only reason they haven’t done this in 40 years is because it's Israeli athletes, and that makes it even more disgraceful.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Who Runs This Town and City Idol {{were created}} by David Meslin, founder of the Toronto Public Space Committee. The City Idol contest sought out {{ordinary}} Torontonians to seek elected office in the 2006 municipal election on November 13. The goal was to have 100 candidates participate {{in a series of}} events whereby some would be voted off by a live audience. The [...] "prize" [...] was a campaign to run for Toronto city council, in the form of volunteer support (not funds). The first round was held at the Danforth Music Hall on April 28, 2006, and saw 70 candidates give <b>one-minute</b> <b>speeches</b> to an audience of more than 600 people who then voted for five candidates. A total of 48 candidates advanced to the second round regional runoffs.|$|E

30|$|First, silent parts, {{which are}} added {{before and after}} each music piece, are deleted because {{real-world}} video data usually have no boundary information for music. Two types of datasets were prepared. For the first dataset, a continuous music dataset was obtained by concatenating 100 music datasets. Silent parts between music pieces {{were not included in}} the dataset. This condition is considered to be strict for methods that consider the acoustic difference [4 – 6]. There were 99 boundaries for the continuous music dataset. For the second dataset, a music-voice mixed dataset, in which a <b>one-minute</b> <b>speech</b> was inserted between music pieces, was used as the continuous music dataset. Therefore, we inserted 99 speech sections that were taken from an open speech corpus of Japanese newspaper article sentences. There were 198 boundaries between voice sections and music sections.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe goal of {{this paper}} is to present an on-line {{paradigm}} being developed among the ProDiGE research group at the "Parole et Langage" laboratory at the University of Provence in Aix-en-Provence. This paradigm aims at studying the perception of breaks and discourse boundaries by expert and/or naive listeners. An experimental technique was designed to compare the listeners' perception of breaks and boundaries in four different speech types (normal, low-pass filtered, re-synthezised and re-synthesized with phoneme conversion). Thirty naive subjects took part in the present experiment in which two versions of a <b>one-minute</b> tape-recorded spontaneous <b>speech</b> sample were compared (normal vs. converted phonemes). The results show similar total numbers and average inter-subject agreement values for breaks identified by a majority of subjects; however, segmented portions differ both in the position of their boundaries and in the nature of the textual units they isolate...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{religious}} dimension of Republican legislators’ participation in <b>one-minute</b> <b>speeches</b> during the 104 th Congress (1995 – 1996). Many have characterized the House Republican Conference that emerged after the 1994 elections {{as a highly}} cohesive majority party. Even in that context, however, legislators represent varied personal agendas, and in part these are informed by religion. We topically coded a subset of floor speeches to measure {{the extent to which}} variation is observed in the issues addressed by Members of Congress. The findings demonstrate that on key policy domains, such as the role of government, culture, and social welfare, speech participation varies systematically on the basis of member religion. This suggests that legislative participation is influenced by genuine personal preferences in additional to strategic political factors...|$|E
