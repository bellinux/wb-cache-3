5|$|As of 2014, {{the wind}} {{industry}} in the USA is able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades, capturing the faster winds at higher elevations. This has opened up new opportunities and in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, the price <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>from</b> wind turbines built 300 feet to 400 {{feet above the ground}} can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal. Prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been increasing the amount of wind energy in their portfolio, saying it is their cheapest option.|$|E
5|$|As {{second in}} command of the SS and then Reichsführer-SS, Himmler was in regular contact with Hitler to arrange for SS men as bodyguards; Himmler was not {{involved}} with Nazi Party policy-making decisions in the years leading up to the seizure <b>of</b> <b>power.</b> <b>From</b> the late 1930s, the SS was independent of the control of other state agencies or government departments, and he reported only to Hitler.|$|E

5|$|Rwanda {{had been}} {{ruled by a}} Tutsi monarchy {{since at least the}} 18th century, with entrenched pro-Tutsi and anti-Hutu policies. Germany and Belgium {{successively}} controlled Rwanda through the early 20th century, with both European nations ruling through the kings and perpetuating a pro-Tutsi policy. After 1945 a Hutu counter-elite developed, leading to the deterioration of relations between the groups. The Tutsi leadership agitated for speedy independence to cement their power, and the Hutu elite called for the transfer <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>from</b> Tutsi to Hutu (a stance increasingly supported by the Roman Catholic Church and the colonial government).|$|E
5|$|After {{a catastrophic}} flood in 1889, the Johnstown Inclined Plane was {{completed}} in 1891 {{to serve as an}} escape route for future floods, as well as a convenient mode of transportation for the residents of the new communities situated above the valley. It was operated by Cambria Iron Company and its successor Bethlehem Steel until 1935, when it was sold to the borough of Westmont. The incline was briefly shut down in 1962 when its supply <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>from</b> Bethlehem Steel was terminated. Twice in its history, the Johnstown Inclined Plane fulfilled its role as a means of evacuation from floodsonce in 1936 and again in 1977. The incline was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and was designated a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark in 1994. It had major renovations in 1962 and from 1983 to 1984.|$|E

5|$|As Prime Minister from 14 January 1991 to 22 August 1991 Pavlov {{initiated}} the 1991 Soviet monetary reform, {{commonly referred to}} as the Pavlov reform, in early 1991. Early on he told the media that the reform was initiated to halt the flow of Soviet roubles transported to the Soviet Union from abroad. Although ridiculed at the time, the statement was later proven to be true. In June the same year, Pavlov called for a transfer <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>from</b> the President of the Soviet Union to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers. When that failed, he joined a plot to oust Gorbachev. In August, he participated in the 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt, which tried to prevent the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Pavlov was arrested for his involvement in the coup and went on to work in the banking sector in post-Soviet Russia. He was succeeded as premier by Ivan Silayev.|$|E
5|$|As the {{aircraft}} flew eastwards over the outer suburbs of Perth numerous witnesses observed {{that it was}} flying at a lower altitude than usual for the daily Skymaster services, {{and at least one}} of the engines was running roughly and backfiring at regular intervals. In the minutes before it crashed, witnesses heard a number of different engine noises – sometimes operating normally, sometimes all engine noise ceased, only to be replaced by a very loud, high-pitched scream. When the wrecked engines were examined many weeks after the accident a significant amount of corrosion product was found in the fuel system within two of the engines. After a preliminary investigation, Investigators from the Department of Civil Aviation believed the water responsible for the corrosion was also responsible for rough running of at least one engine, and ultimately temporary loss <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>from</b> all engines on at least one occasion. The Investigators did not find a likely source for the water.|$|E
5|$|At the Middle Preclassic city of Nakbe in {{the central}} lowlands, Maya sculptors were {{producing}} {{some of the earliest}} lowland Maya stelae, depicting richly dressed individuals. Nakbe Stela1 has been dated to around 400BC. It was broken into pieces, but originally represented two elaborately dressed figures facing each other, and perhaps represents the transference <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>from</b> one ruler to his successor, however it also has features that recall the myth of the Maya Hero Twins, and would be the earliest known presentation of them. Around 200BC the enormous nearby city of ElMirador had started to erect stela-like monuments, bearing inscriptions that appear to be glyphs but that are so far unreadable. Stela dating to the Late Preclassic period are also known from the sites of El Tintal, Cival, and San Bartolo in Guatemala, and Actuncan and Cahal Pech in Belize.|$|E

5|$|Before the 1080s, the {{majority}} of officials drafted came from a regionally diverse background; afterwards, intraregional patterns of drafting officials became more common. Hartwell writes that during the Southern Song, the shift <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>from</b> central to regional administrations, the localized interests of the new gentry, the enforcement of prefectural quotas in preliminary examinations, and the uncertainties of a successful political career in the factionally split capital led many civil servants to choose positions {{that would allow them}} to remain in specific regions. Hymes demonstrates how this correlated with the decline in long-distance marriage alliances that had perpetuated the professional elite in the Northern Song, as the Southern Song gentry preferred local marriage prospects. It was not until the reign of Emperor Shenzong (r. 1068–1085) that the now heavily populated regions of South China began providing a quantity of officials in policy-making posts that were proportionate to their share of China's total population. From 1125 to 1205, about 80% of all those who held office in one of the six ministries of the central government had spent most of their low-grade official careers within the area of modern southern Anhui, southern Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces. Almost 100% of these officials were born and buried within this southeastern macroregion.|$|E
5|$|In early 2016, Sabah had a {{total number}} of 42,047 {{teachers}} teaching in various pre-schools, primary and secondary schools. Following the decentralisation <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>from</b> {{the federal government to}} state government as well to improve the education in the state, there has been a target to reach 90% of teachers from Sabahans itself. Sabah State Library are the main public library in the state. There is another 11 Indonesian schools (beside the main Indonesian school in the state capital) spreading across Sabah mainly for Indonesian migrants children residing in the state. Since 2014, Filipino migrants children also have been enrolled to recently established Alternative Learning Centre (ALC) that was set-up by Filipino volunteers in Sabah with a collaboration with various local non-governmental organisations (NGO).|$|E
5|$|On the Pacific Coast ElBaúl Stela1 {{features}} a date in its hieroglyphic text that equates to 36 AD. It depicts a ruler bearing a sceptre or a spear {{with a double}} column of hieroglyphic text before him. At Takalik Abaj are two stelae (Stela2 and Stela5) depicting the transfer <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>from</b> one ruler to another; they both show two elaborately dressed figures facing {{each other with a}} column of hieroglyphic text between them. The Long Count date on Stela2 dates it to the 1st centuryBC at the latest, while Stela5 has two dates, the latest of which is 126 AD. The stela was associated with the burial of a human sacrifice and other offerings. Stela13 at Takalik Abaj also dates to the Late Preclassic; a massive offering of more than 600 ceramic vessels was found at its base, together with 33 obsidian prismatic blades and other artefacts. Both the stela and the offering were associated with a nearby Late Preclassic royal tomb. At Cuello in Belize, a plain stela was raised around 100 AD in an open plaza.|$|E

5|$|One lap later, Daniil Kvyat {{suffered}} a heavy impact at the penultimate corner, causing another safety car period. Both Hamilton and Vettel used this to change tyres again, as did Button on lap 45. The safety car {{came back in}} {{at the end of}} lap 46, with the order being: Rosberg, Hamilton, Verstappen, Vettel, Alonso, Pérez, Button and Maldonado. At the restart, Verstappen tried to move past Hamilton but failed and was in turn overtaken by Vettel. On lap 48, Nico Rosberg lost the lead to Hamilton after sliding off track due to wheelspin in his rear tyres. The German later declared that his mistake was caused by a strong gust of wind. Hamilton soon opened up a gap to his teammate, while Jenson Button moved up into sixth ahead of Alonso on lap 50, but lost the position again to Sainz {{before the end of the}} race. His teammate Alonso had been running fifth, but a loss <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>from</b> his engine moved him down the order to eventually finish eleventh. In the closing laps, Vettel edged closer to Rosberg in second, but was unable to overtake. This meant that Hamilton, who crossed the line as race winner, also took his third career championship title, with both Vettel and Rosberg now too far behind.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the main}} impacts of the {{revolution}} in Zanzibar was to break {{the power of the}} Arab/Asian ruling class, who had held it for around 200 years. Despite the merger with Tanganyika, Zanzibar retained a Revolutionary Council and House of Representatives which was, until 1992, run on a one-party system and has power over domestic matters. The domestic government is led by the President of Zanzibar, Karume being the first holder of this office. This government used the success of the revolution to implement reforms across the island. Many of these involved the removal <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>from</b> Arabs. The Zanzibar civil service, for example, became an almost entirely African organisation, and land was redistributed from Arabs to Africans. The revolutionary government also instituted social reforms such as free healthcare and opening up the education system to African students (who had occupied only 12% of secondary school places before the revolution).|$|E
5|$|Springfield is in {{the midst}} of a massive heat wave. Every {{building}} in the town has installed a large air conditioning device. However, this draws a lot <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>from</b> the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Despite the safety measures Mr. Burns has taken (cutting power to the orphanage), the plant is at full power. At home, without an air conditioning device, the Simpsons have to follow an old-fashioned fan. Homer decides to give them a taste of winter by plugging in his dancing Santa Claus. This overloads the plant and causes a town-wide blackout. Eventually, widespread rioting and looting occur. The police try to intervene, but are powerless to stop the massive crime wave.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. For any fixed power exponent, it {{is shown}} that the first digits <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> <b>from</b> perfect <b>power</b> numbers follow a {{generalized}} Benford law (GBL) with size-dependent parameter that converges asymptotically to a GBL with half <b>of</b> the inverse <b>power</b> exponent. In particular, asymptotically as the power goes to infinity these first digit sequences obey Benford’s law. Moreover, we show {{the existence of a}} one-parameter size-dependent function that converges to the parameter of these GBL’s and determine an optimal value that minimizes its deviation to two minimum estimators of the size-dependent parameter over the finite range <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> <b>from</b> perfect <b>power</b> numbers less than 105 m·s, m = 2, [...] ., 6, where s = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 is a fixed power exponent...|$|R

5|$|The {{role of the}} new ministry, {{which set}} up its offices in the 18th-century Ordenspalais across from the Reich Chancellery, was to {{centralise}} Nazi control of all aspects of German cultural and intellectual life. Goebbels hoped to increase popular support of the party from the 37 per cent achieved at the last free election held in Germany on 25 March 1933 to 100 per cent support. An unstated goal was to present to other nations {{the impression that the}} NSDAP had the full and enthusiastic backing of the entire population. One of Goebbels' first productions was staging the Day of Potsdam, a ceremonial passing <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>from</b> Hindenburg to Hitler, held in Potsdam on 21 March. He composed the text of Hitler's decree authorizing the Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses, held on 1 April. Later that month, Goebbels travelled back to Rheydt, where he was given a triumphal reception. The townsfolk lined the main street, which had been renamed in his honour. On the following day, Goebbels was declared a local hero.|$|E

The revolt was deemed unnecessary later in the year, when the Spanish government recalled Palacio from office to investigate charges of abuse <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>from</b> his part, but Gómez and Betances established a friendship and logistical relationship that lasted until Betances' death in 1898.|$|E
