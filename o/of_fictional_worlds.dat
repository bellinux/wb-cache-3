40|$|The thesis being {{presented}} aims {{to stress the}} differences between characters in <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds</b> and characters in storyworlds by means of question of possibilities and limits of reader's inferences. The aims of this thesis is to prove that storyworld construed as a mental model manages to avoid some problems that relate to <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds</b> theories. First chapter provides an insight into the issue of definitions and theories of character and places cognitive approaches to character within it. Since a concept <b>of</b> <b>fictional</b> <b>world</b> and a concept of storyworld are often construed as very alike, in the second chapter, there are two opposed opinions concerning reader's activity during a construction <b>of</b> <b>fictional</b> world; that is theories of Lubomír Doležel and Marie-Laure Ryan. By means of their mutual comparision, the distinctive status <b>of</b> <b>fictional</b> character concerning reader's inferences is being emphasized that further bears a decisive role within theory of Umberto Eco of which a core is presented in chapter three.
