25|$|Intermediate plains {{material}} has a roughness and crater density transitional between intercrater plains material and smooth plains material. In the Borealis region, the unit {{occurs in a}} rather extensive belt that extends from the Shakespeare quadrangle into Borealis north and northeast of Suisei Planitia. Intermediate plains material was first recognized and mapped in the Tolstoj quadrangle (Schaber and McCauley, 1980), where it primarily occurs on the floors of craters. It was identified there by a lower crater density than that of intercrater plains material and by “a lower incidence of small bright-halo craters than are found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>smooth</b> plains material” (Schaber and McCauley, 1980). Both characteristics are also typical of intermediate plains material in the Borealis region.|$|E
25|$|Patches of less cratered, smoother, less rolling plains occur {{throughout}} the quadrangle, but their recognition is {{highly dependent on}} the resolution and lighting of individual Mariner 10 frames. Therefore, because their distribution cannot now be mapped accurately, many of these patches are included with the smooth plains material. Certain patches of these intermediate plains, where clearly rougher and possibly older, are mapped as the intermediate plains material. These patches occur mostly within the floors of ancient craters and are distinguished by a slightly greater density of small craters and a lower incidence of small bright-halo craters than are found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>smooth</b> plains material. The presence of plains intermediate in roughness and crater density between the oldest plains and the post-Caloris plains suggests that plains formation was {{a more or less}} continuous process that spanned much of the early geologic history of Mercury.|$|E
25|$|Angiotensin I {{is further}} cleaved {{in the lungs}} by endothelial-bound {{angiotensin}}-converting enzyme (ACE) into angiotensin II, the most vasoactive peptide. Angiotensin II is a potent constrictor of all blood vessels. It acts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>smooth</b> muscle and, therefore, raises the resistance posed by these arteries to the heart. The heart, trying to overcome this increase in its 'load', works more vigorously, causing the blood pressure to rise. Angiotensin II also acts on the adrenal glands and releases aldosterone, which stimulates the epithelial cells in the distal tubule and collecting ducts of the kidneys to increase re-absorption of sodium, exchanging with potassium to maintain electrochemical neutrality, and water, leading to raised blood volume and raised blood pressure. The RAS also acts on the CNS to increase water intake by stimulating thirst, as well as conserving blood volume, by reducing urinary loss through the secretion of vasopressin from the posterior pituitary gland.|$|E

25|$|A {{new chapter}} was opened when Max Lewandowsky in 1899 in Berlin {{observed}} that adrenal extracts acted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>smooth</b> muscle {{of the eye}} and orbit of cats – as the iris dilator muscle and nictitating membrane – {{in the same way}} as sympathetic nerve stimulation. The correspondence was extended by John Newport Langley and, under his supervision, Thomas Renton Elliott in Cambridge. In four papers in volume 31, 1904, of the Journal of Physiology Elliott described the similarities organ by organ. His visionary hypothesis stands in the abstract of a presentation to the Physiological Society of May 21, 1904, a little over ten years after Oliver and Schäfer’s presentation: ″Adrenalin does not excite sympathetic ganglia when applied to them directly, as does nicotine. Its effective action is localised at the periphery. … I find that even after … complete denervation, whether of three days’ or ten months’ duration, the plain muscle of the dilatator pupillae will respond to adrenalin, and that with greater rapidity and longer persistence than does the iris whose nervous relations are uninjured. Therefore, it cannot be than adrenalin excites any structure derived from, and dependent for its persistence on, the peripheral neurone. … The point at which the stimulus of the chemical excitant is received, and transformed into what may cause the change of tension of the muscle fibre, is perhaps a mechanism developed out of the muscle cell in response to its union with the synapsing sympathetic fibre, the function of which is to receive and transform the nervous impulse. Adrenalin might then be the chemical stimulant liberated on each occasion when the impulse arrives at the periphery.″ The abstract is the ″birth certificate″ of chemical neurotransmission. Elliott was never so explicit again. It seems he was discouraged by the lack of a favourable response from his seniors, Langley in particular, and a few years later he left physiological research.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} metrical task systems, {{a general}} framework to model online problems. Borodin, Linial and Saks [BLS 92] presented a deterministic work function algorithm (WFA) for metrical task systems having a tight competitive ratio of 2 n− 1. We present a smoothed competitive analysis of WFA. Given an adversarial task sequence, we smoothen the request costs {{by means of}} a symmetric additive smoothing model and analyze the competitive ratio of WFA <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>smoothed</b> task sequence. We prove upper and matching lower bounds <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>smoothed</b> competitive ratio of WFA. Our analysis reveals that <b>the</b> <b>smoothed</b> competitive ratio of WFA is much better than O(n) and that it depends on several topological parameters of the underlying graph G, such as the maximum degree D and the diameter. For example, already for small perturbations <b>the</b> <b>smoothed</b> competitive ratio of WFA reduces to O(log n) on a clique or a complete binary tree and to O (√ n) on a line. We also provide the first average case analysis of WFA showing that its expected competitive ratio is O(log(D)) for various distributions. ...|$|R
