5|$|A natural form {{of large}} scale {{environmental}} shading/dimming {{has been identified}} that affected the 2006 northern hemisphere hurricane season. The NASA study found that several major dust storms in June and July in the Sahara desert sent dust drifting <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean and through several effects caused cooling of the waters, thus dampening the development of hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|All major {{forecasting}} agencies predicted an above-average season. All {{reduced their}} seasonal predictions in early August, {{but even the}} revised predictions were too high. The lack of activity was primarily caused by an unexpected significant weakening of the Atlantic Ocean thermohaline circulation between winter and spring. This resulted in continuation of the spring weather pattern <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean, with strong vertical wind shear, mid-level moisture, and atmospheric stability, which suppressed tropical cyclogenesis.|$|E

However, Zakhaev promptly launches nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles at the U.S. Eastern Seaboard, with the potential of causing 41 million casualties. The SAS and Force Recon, however, manage to breach the facility, seize the command room and remotely destroy the missiles <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean. They escape in military trucks with Zakhaev's forces in hot pursuit.|$|E

5|$|The Germans {{attempted}} {{to build on}} their success against Convoy Faith by carrying out further medium-altitude attacks on convoys. III./KG 40 sank another four ships between July and September 1943, but suffered heavy losses from Allied aircraft and anti-aircraft guns. From October, Heinkel He177s largely took over the Condors' anti-shipping role, and the last Condor sorties were made <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> in early 1944.|$|E
5|$|The {{disappearance}} of L'Oiseau Blanc {{is considered one}} of the great mysteries in the history of aviation. Many rumors circulated about the fate of the aircraft and crew, with mainstream opinion at the time being that the aircraft was probably lost in a squall <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic.</b> Investigations starting in the 1980s suggest that the aircraft probably reached Newfoundland, and may have crashed in Maine.|$|E
5|$|As Christopher Landsea et al. point out, many {{tropical}} cyclones {{that formed}} {{on the open}} sea and did not affect any coast usually went undetected prior to satellite observation since the 1970s. They estimated an undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910. These undercounts roughly {{take into account the}} typical size of tropical cyclones, the density of shipping tracks <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> basin, and the amount of populated coastline.|$|E

5|$|Flight leader Lt. Charles C. Taylor had mistakenly {{believed}} that the small islands he passed over were the Florida Keys, so his flight was over the Gulf of Mexico and heading northeast would take them to Florida. It was determined that Taylor had passed over the Bahamas as scheduled, and he did in fact lead his flight to the northeast <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic.</b> The report noted that some subordinate officers did likely know their approximate position as indicated by radio transmissions stating that flying west would result in reaching the mainland.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{anticipation}} of a more westerly track on September23, a hurricane watch was issued for the northwestern Bahamas, later superseded by a warning, and a hurricane warning was declared for eastern Cuba. Early on September24, all watches and warnings for the Caribbean Islands, including the Bahamas, were discontinued as Emily moved out <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean. On September25, a special advisory was issued for Bermuda as tropical storm-force winds were likely to impact the island. Following the unexpected intensification, another special advisory was issued stating that hurricane-force winds would impact the island during the day on September25. This advisory was discontinued following the storms' passage later that day.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Alberto {{completed}} the largest loop ever observed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean, spanning approximately 5degrees latitude by 8degrees longitude. The storm {{is currently the}} ninth longest-lived storm in the Atlantic Ocean (lasting 19.75days), and is also the second longest-lived Atlantic storm during August (the longest lived is the 1899 Hurricane San Ciriaco). Also, Alberto is the third farthest-travelling in the Atlantic (travelling 6,500miles), only behind Hurricane Faith and Hurricane Carrie, being able to retain tropical characteristics at an unusually high latitude, up to 53˚N. The last storm to do so was Hurricane Frances in 1980.|$|E
40|$|The Georgia Tech group's {{effort on}} NASA's GTE program and TRACE-A field mission {{primarily}} involved {{analysis and interpretation}} of the measurement data base obtained during the TRACE-A field campaign. These investigations focused {{on the distribution of}} ozone and ozone precursors <b>over</b> <b>the</b> south <b>Atlantic</b> and nearby continental regions of Africa and South Africa. The Transport and Atmospheric Chemistry near the Equator-Atlantic (TRACE-A) Mission was designed with the goal of investigating tropospheric trace gas distributions, sources, and photochemical state <b>over</b> <b>the</b> southern <b>Atlantic.</b> Major scientific issues related to N(x) O(y) tropospheric chemistry addressed in this program included: (1) what controls the tropospheric ozone budget <b>over</b> <b>the</b> southern <b>Atlantic?</b> (2) What are the spatial distributions of CO, CO 2, NO, NO 2, NO(sub y), O 3, NMHC, H 2 O 3, etc. <b>over</b> <b>the</b> southern <b>Atlantic?</b> (3) How does long range transport of long-lived NO(y) compounds affect the more reactive NO(x) budget in southern Atlantic troposphere...|$|R
40|$|A {{statistical}} {{system to}} predict sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) <b>over</b> <b>the</b> tropical oceans, {{with emphasis on}} <b>the</b> tropical <b>Atlantic,</b> is described. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is used to identify critical sequences of predictor patterns which tend to evolve into subsequent patterns, {{and that can be}} used to form a forecast. The results indicate that SST fields <b>over</b> <b>the</b> equatorial Pacific and tropical Atlantic can be a potential predictor of <b>the</b> SSTA <b>over</b> <b>the</b> tropical <b>Atlantic</b> with three to four months in advance. The spatial structures of <b>the</b> SSTA <b>over</b> <b>the</b> tropical <b>Atlantic</b> for <b>the</b> period March-April-May are well captured by the predictions done with initial conditions from September to February. Model performance is better <b>over</b> <b>the</b> northern tropical <b>Atlantic</b> than <b>over</b> <b>the</b> southern tropical <b>Atlantic,</b> where persistence is hardly beaten. Results of this work can contribute to improve seasonal climate predictions of rainfall anomalies <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Northeast Brazil region...|$|R

5|$|In meteorology, {{the trade}} winds {{act as the}} {{steering}} flow for tropical storms that form <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> Pacific, and southern Indian Oceans and make landfall in North America, Southeast Asia, and Madagascar and eastern Africa, respectively. Trade winds also transport African dust westward across the Atlantic Ocean into the Caribbean Sea, as well as portions of southeastern North America. Shallow cumulus clouds are seen within trade wind regimes, and are capped from becoming taller by a trade wind inversion, which is caused by descending air aloft from within the subtropical ridge. The weaker the trade winds become, the more rainfall can be expected in the neighboring landmasses.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{mitigate}} risks, a massive testing program was started. By mid-1954, the first production drawings were issued and wind tunnel work began, along with extensive computer simulation studies carried out both in Canada and the United States using sophisticated computer programs. In a related program, nine instrumented free-flight models were mounted on solid fuel Nike rocket boosters and launched from Point Petre over Lake Ontario while two additional models were launched from the NACA facility at Wallops Island, Virginia, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean. These models were for aerodynamic drag and stability testing, flown {{to a maximum}} speed of Mach 1.7+ before intentionally crashing into the water.|$|E
5|$|The {{meteorological}} {{history of}} Hurricane Dennis spanned twenty-two days, beginning with its inception as a tropical wave over Africa on June26, 2005, and terminating with its dissipation on July18 over the Great Lakes of North America. The incipient wave that became Dennis emerged <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean on June29 and moved briskly to the west. Dry air initially inhibited development, though once this abated the wave {{was able to}} consolidate into a tropical depression on July4. The depression soon crossed Grenada before entering the Caribbean Sea whereupon increasingly favorable environmental factors, such as low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures, fueled intensification. Turning west-northwest, the system achieved tropical storm status on July5 and hurricane status the following day.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Cindy can be {{attributed}} to a deepening low-pressure area that tracked from the Great Lakes as a related cold front traveled southeastward and became stationary <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> extending from northern Florida to Bermuda. On July 5, the front spawned a separate cut-off cold-core low off the coast of the Carolinas. This complex scenario resulted in the formation of a tropical depression later during the day, which slowly meandered north-northeastward. Tropical cyclones of this origin typically remain at a small size and evolve slowly, and Cindy complied to this pattern.|$|E
5|$|A {{deepening}} trough {{over the}} eastern United States was forecast {{to turn the}} storm toward the north on August16. This turn took place earlier than forecasters anticipated. The storm slowly intensified as convection was displaced {{from the center of}} circulation; however, upper-level outflow was well-defined and intensification of the storm was expected as it tracked over the Gulf Stream. Later that day, Bob began to consolidate and a reconnaissance plane recorded hurricane-force winds at 1719UTC, following this reading, the NHC upgraded the storm to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Shortly after, the hurricane began to turn towards the north-northeast in response to a subtropical ridge <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> and the trough over the southeastern United States.|$|E
5|$|A {{disturbance}} {{associated with}} the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) left the coast of West Africa on August 9, producing mid-level winds of 75mph (120km/h) in Dakar, Senegal. A weak circulation formed near the sea surface on August10 within an area of thunderstorms. The disturbance moved slowly westward <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean, developing into a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC on August12, around the 10th parallel north, an unusually southern latitude the cyclone would remain around throughout its lifetime. On August13, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alma about 375mi (605km) east of Trinidad and Tobago, as indicated by a Hurricane Hunters flight reporting winds of 65mph (105km/h). This same flight observed a circular eye with a diameter of , the only report of an eye-like structure from this storm.|$|E
