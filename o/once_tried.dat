5|$|Nash grew {{up playing}} soccer—he stated in a 2005 {{interview}} {{that he could have}} played professionally if he had focused on it—and continues to hold an interest in the sport. When Dirk Nowitzki arrived in the NBA from Germany, he and Nash became close friends, in part because they enjoyed watching soccer together. Nash is friends with several professional soccer players, including Alessandro Del Piero, Thierry Henry, Owen Hargreaves, Massimo Ambrosini and Steve McManaman.

A hostile alien invader known as Captain Kabuki (voiced by Lorelei King) descends upon Little Muu and starts taking it apart, piece by piece, contrasting on what Aloha himself had <b>once</b> <b>tried</b> to do to Crater Planet in the first game.

Robbit defeats Kabuki, resulting in the latter escaping.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{struck his}} contemporaries as a sad figure, a loner with few friends in cricket. He rarely {{encouraged}} young players or gave out praise. He liked {{to mix with}} middle-class people, spending money he did not really have, leading to accusations of snobbery. Team-mates regarded him as moody, private and uncommunicative. Often silent {{in the company of}} others, he could be arrogant and unfriendly. Charlie Barnett and Charles Dacre, two of his Gloucestershire team-mates, came almost to hate him. Dacre often played in a reckless way of which Hammond disapproved; Hammond, in turn, may have been jealous of him. Hammond <b>once</b> <b>tried</b> hard to injure Dacre by bowling fast at him while he was wicketkeeper. Barnett began as a close friend but fell out over Hammond's treatment of his first wife and later his refusal to play in Barnett's benefit match. Other players who were involved in disputes with Hammond included Denis Compton, whose cavalier approach Hammond disliked, and Learie Constantine, who believed Hammond insulted him in the West Indies in 1925, although the two later made peace. Hammond's ultimate rivalry was with Bradman, who overshadowed him throughout his career, and with whom he developed an increasing obsession. It was not enough for Hammond to be the second-best batsman in the world, and he disliked the constant comparisons made between them in Bradman's favour. He felt not only that he had to do well, but also that he had to score more than Bradman.|$|E

6000|$|But {{there was}} no room for such misgivings when the {{electric}} shock of actual presence was felt--the thin hollow-cheeked face shone with welcome, the liquid brown eyes smiled with thankful sweetness, the fingers, fleshless, but cool and gentle, were held out; and the faint voice said, [...] "My darling! <b>Once</b> <b>try</b> to make me hear." ...|$|R

25|$|Perhaps {{due in part}} {{to these}} few brief periods of Algerian rule over Tunis in the early Ottoman era, later Turkish rulers in Algiers more than <b>once</b> <b>tried</b> to {{exercise}} control over Tunisian affairs by force, e.g., during intra-dynasty conflicts. Yet eventually such interference by Algiers was each time checked.|$|E

25|$|Jackson's {{peculiar}} personal traits {{contributed to}} his unpopularity as an educator. With little sense of humor, he <b>once</b> <b>tried</b> to get a cadet dismissed from VMI for playing a prank on him. He was a hypochondriac who had sinus problems and arthritis and stood {{for long periods of}} time to keep his internal organs in place, a tiring activity that he believed contributed to good health. He rarely ate much food and often subsisted on crackers and milk. He required little sleep but was known to take catnaps. He liked mineral baths.|$|E

She lost her leg saving Dewey from {{being hit by a}} truck, one of her few recorded good deeds. She <b>once</b> <b>tried</b> to sue Lois, her own daughter, for slipping on a leaf in the walkway of Lois' house and becoming temporarily injured. She was foiled by Francis and the boys who gave their support their parents and the lawyer willingly abandons her. Ida favors Susan over Lois as she is more graceful and talented.|$|E
25|$|Zhao Wenhua had now {{reached the}} apex of his career. However, he had by this time become arrogant and earned the enmity of people from {{government}} officials to the court eunuchs. Even people such as Yan Song and the emperor had become annoyed by his disregard of etiquette. He <b>once</b> <b>tried</b> to bypass Yan Song in pleasing the emperor, presenting a medicinal wine to the emperor claiming {{that it was the}} secret of Yan's longevity. The emperor liked the wine, and later asked Yan Song about it, who was quite surprised and had to confess that he knew nothing about the wine. Yan almost severed relations with Zhao Wenhua for this transgression if not for the good words by Yan's wife. In another incident, Zhao Wenhua was so drunk that he failed to bow and kneel when receiving a gift from the emperor.|$|E
25|$|Other {{theories}} {{maintain that}} Päts trusted the Soviet officials and had befriended {{some of the}} Soviet leaders. It is also possible, that the NKVD controlled Päts's health or the information that reached him. Finnish historian Martti Turtola claims that Päts's actions {{were in accordance with}} the Soviet Union's demands already since the signing of the Soviet–Estonian Mutual Assistance Treaty on 28September 1939 and he didn't even <b>once</b> <b>try</b> to find more suitable compromises.|$|R

25|$|When Susan Richards {{experienced}} {{problems with}} her second pregnancy while Reed was away, Johnny contacted Doom for help, correctly guessing that Doom {{will be unable}} to pass up a chance to succeed where Reed failed (due to the complex events involving the then-recent resurrection of Galactus, this pregnancy is a 'repeat' of an earlier one where Sue miscarried). Doom not only saves Sue's daughter but also cured Johnny of a recent problem with his powers where Johnny was unable to 'flame off' without technological support after becoming overcharged with energy from the Negative Zone by channeling Johnny's excess energy into Sue to keep her alive. After the birth, Doom's only apparent condition for his aid is that he be allowed to name Sue and Reed's daughter, calling her 'Valeria' after his long-lost love. However, this inspires a new plan where Doom makes Valeria his familiar while seeking out her namesake as part of a deal with a trio of demons; by sacrificing his old lover, Doom is granted magical powers on the level he would possess if he had spent the past years studying sorcery rather than science. With this new power, Doom trapped Franklin in Hell, immobilised Doctor Strange, and then neutralises the FF's powers, torturing the other three while taunting Reed by leaving him in his magical library, comparing it to giving a dog a road-map as he concluded that it would be impossible for Reed to master sufficient magical skill to be a threat to him. However, Reed was able to release Doctor Strange's astral self from Doom's traps, allowing Strange to give Reed a sufficient crash-course in magic for Reed to free {{the rest of the team}} and trick Doom into angering his demonic benefactors, prompting them to take him to Hell. Determined to ensure that Doom cannot be a further threat, Reed takes control of Latveria to dismantle all of Doom's equipment, simultaneously subtly driving his family away so that he can trap Doom and himself in a pocket dimension so that he can make sure Doom never threatens anyone again. However, this plan backfires when the rest of the team attempt to rescue Reed, resulting in Doom transferring his spirit into Sue, Johnny and Ben respectively, forcing Reed to kill his best friend to stop his greatest enemy. Doom was returned to Hell, but Reed is later able to use the same machine Doom <b>once</b> <b>tried</b> to create to travel to Heaven and restore Ben to life. Doom remained in Hell until Mjolnir falls to Earth after the events of Ragnarok as it creates a dimensional tear during its fall that allows Doom to escape, although he decides to focus on rebuilding his power base when he proves unable to even lift the hammer. The events of this were deleted from Marvel Comics continuity in the 2015 series Secret Wars.|$|E

500|$|The episode's {{title is}} a {{reference}} to Ernest Thayer's 1888 baseball poem [...] "Casey at the Bat." [...] The episode makes several allusions to the film The Natural. Homer's secret weapon, his self-created [...] "Wonderbat", is akin to Roy Hobbs's [...] "Wonderboy", and both bats are eventually destroyed. The scene featuring the explosion of stadium lights as Homer circles the basepaths is also taken directly from the film. The end song [...] "Talkin' Softball" [...] is a parody of [...] "Talkin' Baseball" [...] by Terry Cashman. Jeff Martin wrote the {{new version of the}} song, but Cashman was brought in to sing it. The scenes of the Power Plant team traveling from city to city by train, overlaid with the pennant of the city they are going to, is {{a reference to}} the 1942 film The Pride of the Yankees. Carl batting with a piano leg is a reference to Norm Cash of the Detroit Tigers, who <b>once</b> <b>tried</b> to bat with a table leg in a game where Nolan Ryan was extremely overpowering and threw a no-hitter.|$|E
500|$|He {{was often}} in {{conflict}} with his brothers regarding internal matters, with Nhu, Diệm's most influential adviser, controlling {{the southern part of}} the country. The brothers often competed with each other for U.S. aid contracts and the rice trade, but did not interfere with matters in one another's territorial zone. Cẩn had <b>once</b> <b>tried</b> to set up an office for his secret police in Saigon (which was in Nhu's southern region) by showing Diệm his long list of detained political opponents, but insisted that he not have to report to Nhu. He brutally suppressed dissent by using torture and re-education camps to achieve his aims. Comparing Cẩn to his brothers, Scigliano said that he was [...] "also considered the most severe, some would say primitive, member of the family and he rules his domain with a strict and sometimes brutal hand". Referring to his autocratic style, a Vietnamese critic said that unlike Diệm, Cẩn was consistent and left his followers in no doubt as to what he wanted: [...] "They are not confused by double talk about democratic ideals and institutions". His creation of a well-defined system of incentives and deterrence has been cited as one reason for his success.|$|E
