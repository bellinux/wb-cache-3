5|$|In Tarner Park, an area <b>of</b> <b>open</b> <b>space</b> {{formed from}} part of number 1 Tilbury Place's grounds, {{there is a}} {{circular}} tower which {{is believed to have}} been built by Edward Tilbury Tarner (son of the original occupants Edward and Laetitia Tarner) as an observation tower so he could see ships in the English Channel. The mid-19th-century structure has two storeys and about 70 steps; the upper level is recessed and has a walkway around it. The walls are of knapped flint with some brick and stonework. Part of an iron weather vane remains at the top. Both storeys have segmental-arched entrances, but these are now closed. The structure is in good condition but has some missing flints.|$|E

40|$|As the {{population}} of the earth expands the natural world shrinks in order to give space to our growing population. This is a problem since humans have a big part in the destruction of natural habitats. In Gretel Ehrlich’s The Solace <b>of</b> <b>Open</b> <b>Spaces</b> we find a close interaction between human culture and nature. The Solace <b>of</b> <b>Open</b> <b>Spaces</b> can be categorized as creative non fiction, and with this is mind I intend to employ a theoretical approach called ecocriticism when analyzing The Solace <b>of</b> <b>Open</b> <b>Spaces.</b> The following essay will examine how the narrator of The Solace <b>of</b> <b>Open</b> <b>Spaces</b> has depicted the relation between nature and culture. The study will be conducted by a close reading of The Solace <b>of</b> <b>Open</b> <b>Spaces.</b> Other than the close reading a series of important articles and websites have been consulted for further information regarding certain keywords and concepts. Important keywords which are found throughout the essay are: anthropocentrism, cowboy, culture, dualism, nature and sheepherder. My initial theory is that even though it might not be intended, a nature and culture dualism is present in The Solace <b>of</b> <b>Open</b> <b>Spaces.</b> I base the assumption on my belief that all humans objectify nature and see nature as a possession. The aim of the essay is to establish whether there is a nature and culture dualism present in The Solace <b>of</b> <b>Open</b> <b>Spaces...</b>|$|R
5|$|The density {{measured}} by NEAR Shoemaker, 1,300kg/m³, {{is less than}} half that of a typical carbonaceous chondrite; this may indicate that the asteroid is very loosely packed rubble pile. The same is true of several C-type asteroids studied by ground-based telescopes equipped with adaptive optics systems (45 Eugenia, 90 Antiope, 87 Sylvia and 121 Hermione). Up to 50% of the interior volume of Mathilde consists <b>of</b> <b>open</b> <b>space.</b> However, the existence of a 20-km-long scarp may indicate that the asteroid does have some structural strength, so it could contain some large internal components. The low interior density is an inefficient transmitter of impact shock through the asteroid, which also helps to preserve the surface features to a high degree.|$|E
5|$|Developed {{after the}} Second World War, the western {{section of the}} campus {{consists}} mainly of modernist and internationalist structures that house laboratories and faculty offices. The most significant example of Brutalist architecture is the massive Robarts Library complex, built in 1972 and opened a year later in 1973. It features raised podia, extensive use of triangular geometric designs and a towering fourteen-storey concrete structure that cantilevers above a field <b>of</b> <b>open</b> <b>space</b> and mature trees.

5|$|During {{his time}} as a student, Gaudí was able to study a {{collection}} of photographs of Egyptian, Indian, Persian, Mayan, Chinese and Japanese art owned by the School of Architecture. The collection also included Moorish monuments in Spain, which left a deep mark on him and served as an inspiration in many of his works. He also studied the book Plans, elevations, sections and details of the Alhambra by Owen Jones, which he borrowed from the School's library. He took various structural and ornamental solutions from nazarí and mudéjar art, which he used with variations and stylistic freedom in his works. Notably, Gaudí observed of Islamic art its spatial uncertainty, its concept of structures with limitless space; its feeling of sequence, fragmented with holes and partitions, which create a divide without disrupting the feeling <b>of</b> <b>open</b> <b>space</b> by enclosing it with barriers.|$|E

In particular, the study is concentrated on the evaluation of urban quality provided by a good design <b>of</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces,</b> including green areas, walkable areas and squares. In fact, despite the advancement of research {{during the past two}} decades and empirical evidence about the relationship among quality of life, quality <b>of</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> and urban sustainability, there is still a lack of studies on urban quality assessment.
