5|$|The clergy {{was divided}} into two types: the secular clergy, who lived <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> and the regular clergy, who lived under a {{religious}} rule and were usually monks. Throughout the period monks remained a very small proportion of the population, usually less than one per cent. Most of the regular clergy were drawn from the nobility, the same social class {{that served as the}} recruiting ground for the upper levels of the secular clergy. The local parish priests were often drawn from the peasant class. Townsmen were in a somewhat unusual position, as they did not fit into the traditional three-fold division of society into nobles, clergy, and peasants. During the 12th and 13th centuries, the ranks of the townsmen expanded greatly as existing towns grew and new population centres were founded. But throughout the Middle Ages the population of the towns probably never exceeded 10 per cent of the total population.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team {{planned to}} distinguish The Last Remnant from the Final Fantasy series and other role-playing games through {{its focus on}} the battle system. The art direction of the game was focused on making all of the characters stand out on the battlefield, and in making the Remnants stand <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> screens. The cities were designed to not look very fantastical, {{so as to make}} the Remnants more prominent, and were designed early on in the development process {{to give the impression that}} the people of the city were living both literally and figuratively under the power of the gigantic Remnants. The game marked several firsts for Square Enix, as it was their first game to be released on the same day in both Japan and internationally, as well as the first to use motion captures of Western actors. This resulted in the characters' lips speaking English synced to the spoken dialogue, rather than Japanese. The game had always been intended to be released simultaneously worldwide and was to be targeted to players worldwide, which impacted the character design and art direction. The design and dialogue were created to appeal to international players as well as Japanese players, rather than being focused on the norms of the Japanese video game market alone.|$|E

25|$|As {{with every}} Dragon Quest, Koichi Sugiyama {{composed}} {{the music and}} directed all the associated spinoffs. The song heard during gameplay depends {{on a number of}} factors.

Lastly, while <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> each of the first four acts has its own theme song, as does the Hero—in act five, the theme song played depends on who is the first character in the formation.|$|E
25|$|Also, free distribution, even if unauthorized, can be {{beneficial}} to small or new content providers by spreading and popularizing content and therefore generating a larger consumer base by sharing and word of mouth. Several musicians have grown to popularity by posting their music videos on sites like YouTube where the content is free to listen to. This method of putting the product <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> free of DRM not only generates a greater following but also fuels greater revenue through other merchandise (hats, T-shirts), concert tickets, and of course, more sales of the content to paying consumers.|$|E

25|$|Those {{who travel}} between worlds {{are advised to}} limit their {{interactions}} with the inhabitants of foreign worlds {{in order to maintain}} <b>the</b> <b>world</b> order. For this reason, the main characters change their appearance in certain worlds to avoid standing <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>worlds</b> based on <b>The</b> Little Mermaid and The Nightmare Before Christmas, Sora, Donald, and Goofy transform into undersea creatures and Halloween monsters, respectively. For The Lion King, they transformed into animals (or, in Donald and Goofy's case, less humanoid forms) because Nomura felt that it would appear odd to have Sora and <b>the</b> others interact <b>in</b> their standard forms, since no humans appear in that film.|$|R
2500|$|The game {{features}} a passive form of crafting, known as Crew Skills, {{in which a}} player's companions carry out gathering and crafting tasks asynchronously to the player's adventures <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> [...] Each class gets five companions via their storyline. The player can assign up to five companions to perform up to 3 various skills. Crafting skills allow the player's companions to create items, and the player can reverse engineer many items to possibly learn {{to make a better}} version. The item is destroyed in the process, but the player gets some of the materials back. Gathering skills allow the player or their companions to gather resources <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Mission skills allow the player's companions to perform acts on the player's behalf, gaining the player Light or Darkside influence and other rewards, such as medical items or companion gifts.|$|E

2500|$|In Diana Wynne Jones' Charmed Life (1977), two {{orphaned}} children receive magical education {{while living}} in a castle. The setting is a world resembling early 1900s Britain, where magic is commonplace. Diana Wynne Jones has stated in {{answer to a question}} on her webpage: [...] "I think Ms Rowling did get quite a few of her ideas from my books – though I have never met her, so I {{have never been able to}} ask her. My books were written many years before the Harry Potter books (Charmed Life was first published in 1977), so any similarities probably come from what she herself read as a child.

2500|$|The most {{influential}} African American {{of the nineteenth}} century, Douglass {{made a career of}} agitating the American conscience. He spoke and wrote on behalf of a variety of reform causes: women's rights, temperance, peace, land reform, free public education, and the abolition of capital punishment. But he devoted the bulk of his time, immense talent, and boundless energy to ending slavery and gaining equal rights for African Americans. These were the central concerns of his long reform career. Douglass understood that the struggle for emancipation and equality demanded forceful, persistent, and unyielding agitation. And he recognized that African Americans must play a conspicuous role in that struggle. Less than a month before his death, when a young black man solicited his advice to an African American just starting <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> Douglass replied without hesitation: [...] "Agitate! Agitate! Agitate!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Another strong {{theme from}} {{the album is}} peer pressure, {{particularly}} due to the band's part-Christian-part-mainstream status. The song [...] "Gravity" [...] refers to the opposing influences of Heaven and the secular world pulling the band in opposite directions, whilst [...] "Metamorphis" [...] further explores [...] "the fact that <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> although {{everybody wants to be}} their own selves, we're pulled this way and that. Everyone you meet wants you to be something or another. The song asks God to help us to be our own true selves, as God sees us, not the way folk pressure us to be what they want us to be." [...] "Bliss" [...] deals with accusations of selling out; in the words of Stu G, [...] "we know exactly where we want to go, we want to take our music to the world and have it recognized as being as good as anything that's out there. But we're not going to compromise or back away from our integrity as Christians." ...|$|E

2500|$|Accounts {{concerning}} Murphy's youth differ. He {{was born}} in February 1860 either in Southboro, Westboro or Natick, Massachusetts. He {{was the son of}} Irish immigrants, a man [...] "of humble birth and scant education." [...] Murphy's father had a reputation as an athlete, and Murphy's desire as a youth was to become a great athlete. He has been variously reported to have traveled the country participating in [...] "six-day races" [...] at the age of 20 and to have been a boxer and a minor league baseball player. Some accounts state that {{he was part of the}} world's champion Natick Hook and Ladder racing team of the early 1880s with Keene Fitzpatrick, Steve Farrell, Pooch Donovan, Piper Donovan, Johnny Mack and Sid Peet. According to his obituary in The Philadelphia Inquirer, [...] "his ambition was to stand out prominently as a six-day pedestrian and at the age of eighteen he was <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> trying to win fame and fortune on the tan bark track." [...] Then, [...] "after several years of grueling running indoors without anything but glory, Murphy branched out as a sprinter and baseball player." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{world where}} there are no nouns — or where nouns are {{composites}} of other parts of speech, created and discarded according to a whim — and no things, most of Western philosophy becomes impossible. Without nouns about which to state propositions, there can be no a priori deductive reasoning from first principles. Without history, there can be no teleology (showing a divine purpose playing itself <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world).</b> If there can be no such thing as observing the same object at different times, there is no possibility of a posteriori inductive reasoning (generalizing from experience). Ontology — the philosophy {{of what it means to}} be — is an alien concept. Tlön is a world of Berkeleyan idealism with one critical omission: it lacks the omnipresent, perceiving deity on whom Berkeley relied as a point of view demanding an internally consistent world. This infinitely mutable world is tempting to a playful intellect, and its [...] "transparent tigers and ... towers of blood" [...] appeal to baser minds, but a Tlönic world view requires denying most of what would normally be considered common sense reality.|$|E
