5|$|The {{agents of}} the Catholic Church wrote {{detailed}} accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maya,</b> in support of their efforts at evangelization, and absorption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> into the Spanish Empire. This was followed by various Spanish priests and colonial officials who left descriptions of ruins they visited in Yucatán and Central America. In 1839, American traveller and writer John Lloyd Stephens set out to visit a number of Maya sites with English architect and draftsman Frederick Catherwood. Their illustrated accounts of the ruins sparked strong popular interest, and brought the Maya {{to the attention of}} the world. The later 19th century saw the recording and recovery of ethnohistoric accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maya,</b> and the first steps in deciphering Maya hieroglyphs.|$|E
5|$|As Maya {{archaeology}} advanced {{during the}} 20th century and nationalist and ethnic-pride-based ideologies spread, the Mayan-speaking peoples {{began to develop}} a shared ethnic identity as Maya, the heirs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> civilization.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} stelae sculpted {{in the early}} Maya style that bear hieroglyphic texts with Long Count dates that place them in the Late Preclassic. This style of {{sculpture}} is ancestral to the Classic style <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> lowlands.|$|E

5|$|Tonina (or Toniná in Spanish orthography) is a pre-Columbian {{archaeological site}} and ruined city <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> civilization located {{in what is}} now the Mexican state of Chiapas, some 13km (8.1mi) east of the town of Ocosingo.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} a {{non-agricultural}} calendar is the Tzolk'in calendar <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> civilization of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, which is a cycle of 260 days.

This formed part of a more comprehensive system of Maya calendars which combined a series of astronomical observations and ritual cycles.|$|E
5|$|Copán is {{an archaeological}} site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> civilization {{located in the}} Copán Department of western Honduras, {{not far from the}} border with Guatemala. It was the capital city of a major Classic period kingdom from the 5th to 9thcenturies AD. The city was located in the extreme {{southeast}} of the Mesoamerican cultural region, on the frontier with the Isthmo-Colombian cultural region, and was almost surrounded by non-Maya peoples.|$|E

30|$|The {{results are}} similar {{for the control}} group and the total sample; except for <b>the</b> <b>Mayas</b> and <b>the</b> Chinantecs, the values are {{positive}} and statistically significant. In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mayas,</b> <b>the</b> negative values are possibly {{due to the fact that}} tourism is very important in their region, and some tourist centers have been developed within indigenous communities.|$|R
50|$|Cancuén is {{an archaeological}} site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pre-Columbian <b>Maya</b> civilization, located in <b>the</b> Pasión subregion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central <b>Maya</b> {{lowlands}} in <b>the</b> present-day Guatemalan Department <b>of</b> El Petén. <b>The</b> city is notable for having one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest palaces in <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> world.|$|R
5|$|Dynastic rulership {{among the}} lowland Maya is most deeply rooted at Tikal. According to later hieroglyphic records, the dynasty {{was founded by}} Yax Ehb Xook, perhaps in the 1st century AD. At the {{beginning}} of the Early Classic, power in the Maya region was concentrated at Tikal and Calakmul, in the core <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> heartland.|$|E
5|$|From the lake, Cortés {{continued}} {{south along}} the western slopes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> Mountains, a particularly arduous journey that took 12 days to cover , during which he lost {{more than two-thirds of}} his horses. When he came to a river swollen with the constant torrential rains that had been falling during the expedition, Cortés turned upstream to the Gracias a Dios rapids, which took two days to cross and cost him more horses.|$|E
5|$|Important rituals {{such as the}} {{dedication}} of major building projects or the enthronement of a new ruler required a human offering. The sacrifice of an enemy king was the most prized offering, and such a sacrifice involved decapitation of the captive ruler in a ritual reenactment of the decapitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> maize god by the Maya death gods. In AD 738, the vassal king K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat of Quiriguá captured his overlord, Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil of Copán {{and a few days}} later he ritually decapitated him; The decapitation of an enemy king may have been performed as part of a ritual ballgame reenacting the victory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> Hero Twins over the gods of the underworld. Sacrifice by decapitation is depicted in Classic period Maya art, and sometimes took place after the victim was tortured, being variously beaten, scalped, burnt or disembowelled. The Hero Twins myth recounted in the Popol Vuh relates how one of each pair of twins was decapitated by their ballgame opponents.|$|E
50|$|Cival is {{an archaeological}} {{site in the}} Petén Basin region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{southern}} <b>Maya</b> lowlands, which was formerly a major city <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pre-Columbian <b>Maya</b> civilization.

25|$|The main Preclassic sculptural style from <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> area {{is that of}} Izapa, a large {{settlement}} on the Pacific coast where many stelas and (frog-shaped) altars were found showing motifs also present in Olmec art. The stelas, mostly without inscriptions, often show mythological and narrative subjects, some of which appear to relate to <b>the</b> Twin myth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Popol Vuh. Nonetheless, it remains uncertain if <b>the</b> inhabitants <b>of</b> Izapa were ethnically Mayan. For <b>the</b> Classic Period <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mayas,</b> <b>the</b> following major classes of stone sculpture may be distinguished.|$|R
5|$|Maya warriors entered {{battle against}} the Spanish with flint-tipped spears, bows and arrows and stones. They wore padded cotton armour to protect themselves. Members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> {{aristocracy}} wore quilted cotton armour, and some warriors of lesser rank wore twisted rolls of cotton wrapped around their bodies. Warriors bore wooden or animal hide shields decorated with feathers and animal skins.|$|E
5|$|The great cities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> civilization were {{composed}} of pyramid temples, palaces, ballcourts, sacbeob (causeways), patios and plazas. Some cities also possessed extensive hydraulic systems or defensive walls. The exteriors of most buildings were painted, either {{in one or}} multiple colours, or with imagery. Many buildings were adorned with sculpture or painted stucco reliefs.|$|E
5|$|Toniná was an {{aggressive}} {{state in the}} Late Classic, using warfare to develop a powerful kingdom. For much of its history, Toniná was engaged in sporadic warfare with Palenque, its greatest rival {{and one of the}} most important polities in the west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> region, although Toniná eventually became the dominant city in the west.|$|E

5|$|A single soldier {{arriving}} in Mexico in 1520 was carrying smallpox and initiated the devastating plagues that {{swept through the}} native populations of the Americas. Modern estimates of native population decline vary from 75% to 90% mortality. Maya written histories suggest that smallpox was rapidly transmitted throughout the Maya area {{the same year that}} it arrived in central Mexico. Among the most deadly diseases were the aforementioned smallpox, influenza, measles and a number of pulmonary diseases, including tuberculosis. Modern knowledge of the impact of these diseases on populations with no prior exposure suggests that 33–50% of the population <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> highlands perished.|$|E
5|$|As Tikal and its {{hinterland}} reached peak population, {{the area}} suffered deforestation, erosion and nutrient loss {{followed by a}} rapid decline in population levels. Tikal and its immediate surroundings {{seem to have lost}} most of their population between 830 and 950 and central authority seems to have collapsed rapidly. There is not much evidence from Tikal that the city was directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> region during the Terminal Classic, although an influx of refugees from the Petexbatún region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources.|$|E
5|$|Described as the {{definitive}} deathblow to democracy in Guatemala, the coup was widely criticized internationally, {{and contributed to}} long-lasting anti-U.S. sentiment in Latin America. Attempting to justify the coup, the CIA launched Operation PBHISTORY, which sought evidence of Soviet influence in Guatemala among documents from the Árbenz era: the effort was a failure. Castillo Armas quickly assumed dictatorial powers, banning opposition parties, imprisoning and torturing political opponents, and reversing the social reforms of the revolution. Nearly four decades of civil war followed, as leftist guerrillas fought a series of U.S.-backed authoritarian regimes whose brutalities included a genocide <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> peoples.|$|E

40|$|For {{centuries before}} <b>the</b> arrival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spaniards, <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> Indians <b>of</b> Central America lived as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most {{advanced}} civilizations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New World. In spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conflict <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> have faced because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Conquest and civil war, {{they continue to}} represent <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Guatemalan population and have maintained much of their heritage. As the ladino world continues to progress around them, however, <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> {{are faced with the}} struggle between cultural maintenance and the need for progress and modernization. The decisions they make on key issues such as language, dress, and lifestyle will shape the way their descendants will reflect their Mayan heritage. In <b>the</b> best <b>of</b> situations, <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> could find a balance between their cultural ties and the progressing world by maintaining their unique ancestral links while also benefiting from modern society. If they do not, <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> could continue as a marginalized society, or they could loose their unique heritage altogether...|$|R

5|$|Dominican missionaries {{were active}} in Verapaz and the {{southern}} Petén from the late 16th century through the 17th century, attempting non-violent conversion with limited success. In the 17th century, the Franciscans {{came to the conclusion}} that the pacification and Christian conversion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> would not be possible as long as the Itza held out at Lake Petén Itzá. The constant flow of escapees fleeing the Spanish-held territories to find refuge with the Itza was a drain on the workforce managed by the encomienda system.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of the {{deciphering}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> hieroglyphic script, scholars have come to understand that it was a fully functioning writing system in which it was possible to express unambiguously any sentence of the spoken language. The system is of a type best classified as logosyllabic, in which symbols (glyphs or graphemes) can be used as either logograms or syllables. The script has a complete syllabary (although not all possible syllables have yet been identified), and a Maya scribe {{would have been able to}} write anything phonetically, syllable by syllable, using these symbols.|$|E
5|$|Maya {{textiles}} {{are very}} poorly {{represented in the}} archaeological record, although by comparison with other pre-Columbian cultures, such as the Aztecs and the Andean region, {{it is likely that}} they were high-value items. A few scraps of textile have been recovered by archaeologists, but the best evidence for textile art is where they are represented in other media, such as painted murals or ceramics. Such secondary representations show the elite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> court adorned with sumptuous cloths, generally these would have been cotton, but jaguar pelts and deer hides are also shown.|$|E
