5|$|Not all early roguelikes were readily {{classified}} as Hack or Moria descendants. Larn (1986), developed by Noah Morgan, borrowed concepts from both Hack (in {{that there are}} persistent and fixed levels) and Moria (in {{the availability of a}} shop level and general difficulty increasing with dungeon level), but while these two games have spiraled in size to take multiple play sessions to complete, Larn was aimed to be completed in a single session. Larn also uses a fixed-time feature, in that the player had <b>only</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> turns to complete a goal, though there were ways to jump back in time as to extend play. Omega, developed by the Laurence Brothers in the late 1980s, is credited with introducing an overworld concept to the roguelike genre, prior to the feature's appearance in ADOM. Omega was often remembered for its odd inventory approach in which the player would have to pick up an object, considering it being held, and then moving that object to a bag or an equipment slot. Linley's Dungeon Crawl (1995) was created by Linley Henzell and featured a skill-based character progression system, in which experience points could be used to improve specific skills, such as weapon proficiency or trap detection. One fork of this would form the basis for Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (2006). SSI's Dungeon Hack (1993) offered randomized dungeons and permadeath within AD 2nd Edition rules.|$|E

It is used to support a single failing organ system (the lungs) and cannot reverse any underlying disease process (such as terminal cancer). For this reason, there can be (occasionally difficult) decisions to be made about whether it is suitable to commence someone on mechanical ventilation. Equally many ethical issues surround the decision to discontinue mechanical ventilation.|$|E

This is featured on the Bueller, Bueller Edition DVD. Other scenes were never made available on any DVD version. These scenes included additional screen time with Jeanie in a locker room, Ferris' younger brother and sister (both of whom were completely removed from the film), and additional/alternate lines of dialogue throughout the film, {{all of which can}} be seen in the original theatrical trailer.

Commenting on the original development of the episode, series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane stated, [...] " [...] was the result of our ongoing desire to let the series stagnate, and kind of evolve things that may have run their course. There's <b>only</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> times you can do the Evil Monkey jumping out of that closet, before the joke gets old, and I think often times there's a fear to mess with what works, and change things permanently. [...] We literally retired the Evil Monkey in this episode, and got a great episode out of it, which was worth it, and kind of evolved the series in a way." [...] Singer and actress Candace Marie provided the voice of Miley Cyrus. Marie received the role when her producer alerted her of the audition, and she eventually received a call from the Family Guy casting director a month later. Even though the episode mocked Cyrus, Marie did not think she would upset any of Cyrus' fans. She added that she is a fan herself, and [...] "was very impressed by the way Family Guy developed the episode," [...] and thought it was [...] "a huge compliment for them to refer to Miley as the [...] "perfect popstar."" [...] After voicing Cyrus, Marie was called back to Family Guy to voice Meg's friend Beth for [...] "several upcoming episodes."

500|$|Jack Shepherd of The Independent was {{slightly}} {{more critical of}} the early episodes of the season, saying the ideological battle between Murdock and Castle [...] "is the crux of these first few episodes and also highlights the main problem with Daredevil" [...] pointing out that [...] "there is no real bad guy here" [...] and there [...] "is <b>only</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> times you can watch an episode end with Daredevil and Punisher beating each other up before you start thinking there is a glitch in the Matrix." [...] He also agreed with Fitzpatick regarding Curtis-Hall's presence as Ben Urich not being filled in the season. Despite this, Shepherd added that the season began to pick up by the fourth episode, {{with the introduction of}} Elektra, capping with episodes six and seven, which he called [...] "by far the season’s best, laying the foundation for an exciting story ahead", while also praising Cox, Henson, Woll, Bernthal and Yung for their performances. Daniel Fienberg, reviewing the first seven episodes for The Hollywood Reporter, expressed similar sentiments as Shepherd, feeling the episodes missed what Vincent D'Onofrio brought as Wilson Fisk in the first season, or at least [...] "the through-line threat that he presented...Fortunately, the [...] are vividly realized and the action is still visceral and brutal and maybe the big picture will emerge in the season's second half. Because of the portrayals of those two characters, he felt [...] "that there's a challenge to remain wholly invested in plotlines that don't involve them". Despite being [...] "right on the edge of desensitization" [...] regarding the fight scenes, Fienberg still praised them, highlighting the different styles Elektra and the Punisher used [...] "vary the dynamic enough".|$|E

2500|$|GE's {{divestiture}} of NBC's entire radio {{division was}} the first cannon shot of what would play out in the national broadcast media, as each of the Big Three broadcast networks were soon acquired by other corporate entities. NBC was a particularly noteworthy case in that it {{was the first}} to be acquired – and was bought by a conglomerate outside the broadcast industry as GE otherwise primarily served as a manufacturing company. Prior to the GE acquisition, NBC operated its radio division partly out of tradition, and partly to meet its then-FCC-mandated requirement to distribute programming for the public good (the broadcast airwaves are owned by the public; as that broadcast spectrum is limited and <b>only</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> broadcast stations existed, this served as the basis for government regulation requiring broadcasters to provide certain content that meets the needs of the public). Syndicators such as Westwood One were not subject to such rules as they did not own any stations. GE's divestiture of NBC Radio – known as [...] "America's First Network" [...] – in many ways marked the [...] "beginning of the end" [...] of the old era of regulated broadcasting and the ushering in of the new, largely unregulated industry that is present today.|$|E

Hallows opined that Pickard is [...] "probably the person I've cried at the most, some of the more difficult stories he's done, even though you know the story that's coming up, you can't help but have a lump in your throat". Another series producer Bryan Kirkwood praised Pickard's acting skills, stating that he felt Pickard is a [...] "brilliant" [...] actor. He said he was [...] "particularly pleased in moving Tony away from the buffoon he had become over the years into heartbreaking stories such Grace's death and his relationship with Jacqui. He's a touching and sensitive actor who's always over-looked". Series producer Paul Marquess praised Pickard, saying he felt that [...] "there's <b>only</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> daft Tony stories you can do. He's so key to the show and so able and adept". Pickard's colleague Gemma Merna praised Pickard saying Pickard has [...] "had some great storylines", adding that if she was [...] "half as successful as Nick is on the show and liked as much then I would love to stay".|$|E
2500|$|In 1945, Slim {{launched}} an offensive into Burma, with lines of supply stretching almost to breaking point across {{hundreds of miles}} of trackless jungle. In the aftermath of Kohima and Imphal, Slim inspected the battlefields, seeing the bodies of wounded Japanese soldiers who had been killed by their comrades as under the code of Bushido, it was considered shameful to surrender and it was the highest honour for a Japanese man to die for the Emperor, which graphically showed to Slim how far the Japanese were willing to take Bushido. Slim realized that Japanese logistics had broken down, but that Japanese soldiers, motivated by Bushido were still prepared to fight to the death as the Japanese preferred to die for the Emperor rather than surrender, which led him to the conclusion that it was better to outflank and bypass the Japanese positions, leaving the main pockets of the Japanese to stave to death rather than engaging them in combat as much possible. The Burma Area Army had about 100,000 men while the 14th Army had only about 21,000 men, but Slim decided with superior mobility backed by proper supply lines that he could defeat the Burma Area Army, whose logistics were poor. The superior Japanese numbers together {{with the fact that the}} Indian Army was an all-volunteer force with <b>only</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> Indians willing to volunteer and that sending fresh British troops to Burma was not a priority in London made it imperative for Slim to save the lives of his men as much as possible. Slim was painfully aware that it would to be difficult to replace whatever losses his men took, and had no intention of having his army being ground down by fighting the Japanese in every single place that they were. The differences between Slim, who was determined to save the lives of his men as much as possible vs. the fanatical desire of Japanese officers motivated by Bushido to have every man under their command die for the Emperor led Slim to estimate that for every man killed under his command, the Japanese lost a hundred men. The American historian John W. Dower wrote that Slim's claim of 1:100 kill ratio in Burma is creditable. Slim had a close rapport with the officers and soldiers under his command, and always trusted his officers to make the correct decisions without referring to him as Slim later wrote: [...] "I was, like other generals before me, to be saved...by the resourcefulness and the stubborn valour of my troops". Murray and Millet wrote that Slim's willingness to delegate authority down to his officers on the spot played a key role in sustaining his advance into Burma as officers did not have to wait for a decision from him.|$|E
