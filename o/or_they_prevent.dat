40|$|The {{empirical}} {{analysis of}} the micro links between trade and knowledge diffusion allows us to distinguish among the key predictions of the theoretical literature on endogenous growth. This literature postulates that total factor productivity (TFP) is higher when trade gives access to a wider or more sophisticated range of technologies. The papers reviewed here find considerable evidence that imported technologies positively affect TFP in the importing countries, particularly in developing ones and when technologies are acquired by way of imports of intermediates. It also provides some support for the models that argue that exporting is an efficient learning channel. The role of foreign direct investment is more mixed, likely helping the economy but hurting domestic competitors. Relative factor and machinery costs, skill and technology endowments affect the choice of imported technologies. Although the access to foreign technologies has {{a positive impact on}} developing countries' TFP, overall, these countries are shown to purchase older and simpler. But governments' attempts of limiting or guiding technology selection are likely to {{have a negative effect on}} growth, because they force producers either to choose sophisticated technologies they are unable to use <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>prevent</b> them from getting the most appropriate and efficient technologies. Rather, policies aimed at promoting technological development should strengthen the absorptive capacity of importing countries by addressing the relationship of complementarity between human and physical capital...|$|E

40|$|This paper explores several {{problems}} about {{the diffusion of}} the technology {{as well as the}} possible routes or channels to make it happens, the forms which it acquires, based on the conditions and potentialities of the developing countries, and their barriers, among others, analyzing the role that the transnational corporations can play regarding to the diffusion, as a key factor for the innovation, either because <b>they</b> promote it <b>or</b> because <b>they</b> <b>prevent</b> it. It is analyzed methodologically some actions that favour the diffusion and the incorporation of the transnational corporations and the impact of the direct foreign investment in this process. On the other hand, the study {{of the nature of the}} diffusion is approached, by means of the technology transference concept and it is stated the best way that facilitate its diffusion. Another issue is the analysis of the incidence that the protection of the intellectual property has on the diffusion since it affects the decision of a transnational company to settle down in a country, and the desire of the direct foreign investment. An expected result is to understand how the diffusion is affected, by the process of technology transference and by the barriers of the intellectual property, and to conclude with the adoption of elements for the handling of the diffusion routes, the relations with the transnational corporations and the regulation of the intellectual property. </p...|$|R
40|$|Sediment {{traps and}} basins at {{construction}} sites, agricultural operations, and other unsettled areas provide temporary pools for runoff that allow sediment to settle before {{the water is}} discharged into a river, stream, <b>or</b> landscape. <b>They</b> <b>prevent</b> erosion and trap sediment and other coarse material. They are most effective in sandy soils and less effective in clayey soils. Unfortunately, these traps and basins are not efficient when the swift, turbulent water moves along a straight-line flow that takes runoff quickly to the basin’s outlet. This short-circuits interaction with the entire basin. Using baffles to slow, calm, and distribute the water can help solve this problem. Baffles can lengthen the flow path and distribute the flow more widely. They significantly {{increase the amount of}} sediment captured and also trap much smaller particles than open basins. The flow path The typical flow in an open basin receiving peak-period, high-speed runoff is illustrated in Figure 1. The majority of the water entering the basin rushes down the middle from inlet to outlet and does not interact with the entire basin area. Turbulence resulting from the high flow rate gives rise to backflow currents and side eddies, which interfere with the settling process and reduce settling efficiency. Installing either solid or porous baffles can improve the basin’s efficiency. Solid baffles Inlet Outlet are the simplest to install, but porous baffles are more efficient.

40|$|The {{catalytic}} system Pd/C-HCl is highly {{active in the}} redn. of mandelic acid derivs. to phenylacetic acid derivs. with carbon monoxide when the arom. ring is para-substituted with a hydroxy group. Typical reaction conditions are: 70 - 110 °, 20 - 100 atm of carbon monoxide, benzene-ethanol as reaction medium, substrate(vanillomandelic acid) /Pd = 102 - 104 / 1, HCl/substrate = 0. 3 - 0. 8 /L. The proposed catalytic cycle proceeds as follows: the chloride ArCHClCOOR, formed in situ upon reaction of ArCHOHCOOR with hydrochloric acid, oxidatively adds to a Pd(0) species with formation of a catalytic intermediate having a Pd-[CH(Ar) COOR] moiety, which inserts a CO mol., yielding an acyl intermediate of the type Pd- [COCH(Ar) COOR]. The nucleophilic attack of H 2 O on the carbon atom of the carbonyl ligand gives back the Pd(0) complex to the catalytic cycle and yields a phenylmalonic acid deriv., which produces the final product, ArCH 2 COOR, upon CO 2 evolution. Alternatively, protonolysis of the intermediate having a Pd-[CH(Ar) COOR] moiety yields directly the final product and a Pd(II) species, which is then reduced by CO to Pd(0). Moreover, no catalytic activity is obsd. when the Pd/C-HCl system is used in combination with {{any one of the}} above diphosphine ligands, probably because these ligands block the sites on the catalyst able to promote the catalytic cycle <b>or</b> because <b>they</b> <b>prevent</b> the redn. of Pd(II) to Pd(0).

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} opacity questions {{where an}} observation function provides to an external attacker {{a view of}} the states along executions and secret executions are those visiting some state from a fixed subset. Disclosure occurs when the observer can deduce from a finite observation that the execution is secret, the ε-disclosure variant corresponding to the execution being secret with probability greater than 1 − ε. In a probabilistic and non deterministic setting, where an internal agent can choose between actions, there are two points of view, depending on the status of this agent: the successive choices can either help the attacker trying to disclose the secret, if the system has been corrupted, <b>or</b> <b>they</b> can <b>prevent</b> disclosure as much as possible if these choices are part of the system design. In the former situation, corresponding to a worst case, the disclosure value is the supremum over the strategies of the probability to disclose the secret (maximisation), whereas in the latter case, the disclosure is the infimum (minimisation). We address quantitative problems (comparing the optimal value with a threshold) and qualitative ones (when the threshold is zero or one) related to both forms of disclosure for a fixed or finite horizon. For all problems, we characterise their decidability status and their complexity. We discover a surprising asymmetry: on the one hand optimal strategies may be chosen among deterministic ones in maximisation problems, while it is not the case for minimisation. On the other hand, for the questions addressed here, more minimisation problems than maximisation ones are decidable...|$|R

40|$|Unopposed {{radiative}} cooling in clusters of galaxies results in excessive mass deposition rates {{on to the}} central brightest cluster galaxy. However, the cool cores of galaxy clusters are continuously heated by thermal conduction and turbulent heat diffusion due to minor mergers or the galaxies orbiting the cluster centre. These processes can either reduce the energy requirements for active galactic nucleus heating of cool cores, <b>or</b> <b>they</b> can <b>prevent</b> overcooling altogether. We perform three‐dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulations including field‐aligned thermal conduction and self‐gravitating particles to model this in detail. Turbulence {{is not confined to}} the wakes of galaxies but is instead volume filling, due to the excitation of large‐scale g‐modes. We systematically probe the parameter space of galaxy masses and numbers to assess when the cooling catastrophe is prevented. For a wide range of observationally motivated galaxy parameters, we find that the magnetic field is randomized by stirring motions, restoring the conductive heat flow to the core. The cooling catastrophe either does not occur or it is sufficiently delayed to allow the cluster to experience a major merger that could reset the conditions in the intracluster medium. Whilst dissipation of turbulent motions (and hence dynamical friction heating) is negligible as a heat source, turbulent heat diffusion is extremely important; it predominates in the cluster centre. However, thermal conduction becomes important at larger radii, and simulations without thermal conduction suffer a cooling catastrophe. Conduction is important both as a heat source and to reduce stabilizing buoyancy forces, enabling more efficient diffusion. Turbulence enables conduction, and conduction enables turbulence. In these simulations, the gas vorticity – which is a good indicator of trapped g‐modes – increases with time. The vorticity growth is approximately mirrored by the growth of the magnetic field, which is amplified by turbulence...|$|R
