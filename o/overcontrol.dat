We examined whether peer management interrupted 2 peer processes: selection {{and influence of}} delinquent peers. Adolescents' feelings of being <b>overcontrolled</b> by parents were examined as an additional moderator of delinquent selection and influence. Using network data from a community sample (N = 1, 730), we tested whether selection and influence processes varied across early, middle, and late adolescent cohorts. Selection and influence of delinquent peers were evident in all 3 cohorts and {{did not differ in}} strength. Parental monitoring rules reduced the selection of delinquent peers in the oldest cohort. A similar effect was found in the early adolescent cohort, but only for adolescents who did not feel <b>overcontrolled</b> by parents. Monitoring rules increased the likelihood of selecting a delinquent friend among those who felt <b>overcontrolled.</b> The effectiveness of communicating disapproval was also mixed: in the middle adolescent network, communicating disapproval increased the likelihood of an adolescent selecting a delinquent friend. Among late adolescents, high levels of communicating disapproval were effective, reducing the influence of delinquent peers for adolescents reporting higher rates of delinquency. For those who reported lower levels of delinquency, high levels of communicating disapproval increased the influence of delinquent peers. The {{results of this study suggest}} that the effectiveness of monitoring and peer management depend on the type of behavior, the timing of its use, and whether adolescents feel <b>overcontrolled</b> by parents...|$|R

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to explain why some mild mannered {{individuals}} commit extremely assaultive offences, Megargee (1966) has suggested that two personality types exist among extremely assaultive offenders, the undercontrolled who lack inhibitions against the expression of aggression and the <b>overcontrolled</b> who possess excessive inhibitions against such behaviour. Moderately assaultive offenders, however, {{are more likely to}} be composed soley of undercontrolled personalities according to Megargee's Theory of Control. The current study began by carrying out a cluster analysis of MMPI profiles of individuals convicted of homicide. Profile types remarkably similar to those obtained by Blackburn (l 97 l) from 'abnormal' homicides at Broadmoor were obtained which appeared to represent two broad categories of <b>overcontrolled</b> and undercontrolled individuals. A second cluster analysis of MMPI profiles from a random group of predominantly non-violent prisoners revealed, however, similar types. The results of a cluster analysis of WI profiles of non-criminals also challenged Megargee's theory as a profile type was produced which was similar to that found amongst extremely assaultive offenders, and which had previously been described as <b>overcontrolled.</b> The suggestion was made that 'controlled' was a more appropriate term than 'overcontrolled' and the validity of a controlled-undercontrolled typology was examined by contrasting controlled and undercontrolled homicides on a variety of background, intellectual, behavioural and attitudinal variables. In general support was found for the typology, particularly on prison oriented behavioural measures. The implications of the findings for the control and treatment of controlled and undercontrolled prisoners were discussed and a short MMPI scale which discriminated between these groups was developed, and tentatively named the Undercontrolled Personality Scale...|$|R

One hundred and twenty-three college students completed the Big Five Inventory (BFI) and Self-compassion Scale (SCS). A cluster-analysis of the BFI scores yielded three cluster prototypes consistent with <b>overcontrolled,</b> undercontrolled, and resilient personality prototypes identified in previous studies of children and adult community samples. Analyses revealed resilient individuals reported significantly higher overall Self-compassion (M = 3. 08, SD =. 25) compared to both <b>overcontrolled</b> (M = 2. 85, SD =. 20, t = - 4. 32, p <=. 00) and undercontrolled types (M = 2. 90, SD =. 25, t = 3. 53, p <=. 00).

Here, her manager is well-advised to not ignore her lacking emotional support but to seek possible solutions. She could try to modify the task so that it better matches her employee’s underlying motives or to find motive-congruent incentives. Kehr and von Rosenstiel call this “metamotivation”. For example, if her employee’s has a strong need for affiliation, she could try to preferably allocate uncomplicated, friendly customers to her, or to organize the sales pitch as a team event. In addition, the manager could assist her employee in finding a personal vision which matches her employees motives. These measures, if successful, arouse the component heart and increase one’s emotional support. Otherwise, the managers may consult her sales representative in finding effective volitional strategies to overcome her motivational barriers. Kehr und von Rosenstiel call this “metavolition”.

40|$|By 2020 {{depression}} {{is predicted to}} be the second most frequent cause of disability worldwide. Research suggests that existing methods of treatment are ineffective for many resulting in {{a large number of}} chronic, treatment resistant courses (termed refractory depression [RD]). Further evidence suggests that up to 60 % of individuals with RD have a co-morbid Personality Disorder (PD), namely Clusters A and C. As such, it has been proposed that individuals with RD fail to respond to existing treatment interventions because these treatments fail to address maladaptive personality styles (i. e., <b>overcontrol</b> tendencies) that may complicate treatment. This project aimed to test this novel assertion by examining whether individuals with RD exhibit higher levels of <b>overcontrol</b> (e. g., skills deficits in the expression and experience of emotion, in forming close relationships and in receptivity and openness) compared to individuals with current, but not chronic, depression and a normal control group.

Data analyses indicated that resilient athletes reported significantly higher overall present moment attention (M = 4. 09, SD =. 77) compared to both the undercontrolled [M = 3. 45, SD =. 49, t (45) = 3. 39, p =. 01] and <b>overcontrolled</b> groups, M= 4. 09, SD =. 77, t(48) = 3. 49, p =. 01. Resilient athletes were reported significantly higher self-regulation (M = 234. 64, SD = 18. 01) compared only to the undercontrolled group, M = 219. 88, SD = 16. 24, t(45) = 2. 95, p =. 01. No significant differences were detected between men and women on present moment attention or self-regulation. Personality prototype had a significant main effect on present moment attention [F (2, 69) = 4. 77, p <. 01] and gender had a significant main effect on self-regulation, F(1, 69) = 4. 42, p <. 01. However, no interaction between gender and personality prototype was detected on present moment awareness or self-regulation. Distinctive aspects of athlete resilience pertaining to present moment awareness and self-regulation, along with implications for future study of resilience and other personality prototypes in sports psychology are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to analyze the main vocal cues and strategies used by a liar. 31 male university students were asked to raise doubts in an expert in law about a picture. The subjects were required to describe the picture in three experimental conditions: telling the truth (T) and lying to a speaker when acquiescent (L 1) and when suspicious (L 2). The utterances were then subjected to a digitized acoustic analysis in order to measure nonverbal vocal variables. Verbal variables were also analyzed (number of words, eloquency and disfluency index). Results showed that deception provoked an increment in F 0, a greater number of pauses and words, and higher eloquency and fluency indexes. The F 0 related to the two types of lie—prepared and unprepared—identified three classes of liars: good liars, tense liars (more numerous in L 1), and <b>overcontrolled</b> liars (more numerous in L 2). It is argued that these differences are correlated to the complex task of lying and the need to control one's emotions during deception. The liar's effort to control his/her voice, however, can lead to his/her tone being <b>overcontrolled</b> or totally lacking in control (leakage). Finally, the research forwards an explanation on the strategies used by the good liar and in particular treats the self-deception hypothesi...|$|R
40|$|Dialectical {{behavior}} therapy (DBT) {{was originally}} {{designed as a}} treatment of emotionally dysregulated, impulsive, and dramatic disorders (e. g., borderline personality disorder) and populations (e. g., parasuicidal women). However, a number of complex disorders represent the dialectical opposite of BPD and related disorders; these disorders are characterized by being <b>overcontrolled,</b> emotionally constricted, perfectionistic, and highly risk-averse. In this article, the authors introduce a recent adaptation of DBT that targets cognitive–behavioral rigidity and emotional constriction and illustrates its application through {{the case of a}} man suffering from both paranoid personality disorder and obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. <br/...|$|R
