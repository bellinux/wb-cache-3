5|$|Among other effects, the Korean War {{galvanised}} NATO {{to develop}} a military structure. Public opinion in countries involved, such as Great Britain, was divided for and against the war. Many feared an escalation into a general war with Communist China, and even nuclear war. The strong <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> often strained Anglo-American relations. For these reasons British officials sought a speedy end to the conflict, hoping to unite Korea under United Nations auspices and withdrawal of all foreign forces.|$|E
5|$|Shoup's <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> only {{increased}} over time; he initially {{pushed for a}} negotiated settlement but later supported a unilateral pullout from the country. As the Vietnamization strategy took effect and the U.S. increased its air operations, he remained opposed to any strategy that risked a nuclear war with China or the Soviet Union. His criticism attracted more press as the war became a stalemate. It also became highly publicized through discourse among the anti-war movement.|$|E

5|$|The American Library Association honored her for {{her years}} of support to America's {{libraries}} and librarians in April 2005. The Progressive Librarians Guild opposed her being honored, because of her support of the USA PATRIOT Act, her cancellation of a poetry forum due to concern {{that some of the}} poets would express <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> in Iraq, and the Guild's opposition to policies and spending priorities of her husband's administration.|$|E
5|$|Wanyan Liang (the Prince of Hailing) led a coup against Emperor Xizong {{and became}} fourth emperor of the Jin dynasty in 1150. Wanyan Liang {{presented}} {{himself as a}} Chinese emperor, and planned to unite China by conquering the Song. In 1158, Wanyan Liang provided a casus belli by announcing that the Song had broken the 1142 peace treaty by acquiring horses. He instituted an unpopular draft that {{was the source of}} widespread unrest in the empire. Anti-Jin revolts erupted among the Khitans and in Jin provinces bordering the Song. Wanyan Liang did not allow dissent, and <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> was severely punished. The Song had been notified beforehand of Wanyan Liang's plan. They prepared by securing their defenses along the border, mainly near the Yangtze River, but were hampered by Emperor Gaozong's indecisiveness. Gaozong's desire for peace made him averse to provoking the Jin. Wanyan Liang began the invasion in 1161 without formally declaring war. Jurchen armies personally led by Wanyan Liang left Kaifeng on October 15, reached the Huai River border on October 28, and marched {{in the direction of the}} Yangtze. The Song lost the Huai to the Jurchens but captured a few Jin prefectures in the west, slowing the Jurchen advance. A group of Jurchen generals were sent to cross the Yangtze near the city of Caishi (south of Ma'anshan in modern Anhui) while Wanyan Liang established a base near Yangzhou.|$|E

25|$|The National Guardian {{revisited}} several themes with regularity in its {{news coverage}} throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Chief among these was <b>the</b> publication's <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cold <b>War</b> and militarism, {{with the paper}} serving {{as one of the}} only public voices standing in <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Korean <b>War.</b> <b>The</b> paper also supported emerging anti-colonial movements in Africa and Asia, with reporters dispatched abroad to provide first-hand coverage of these revolutionary movements.|$|R

JI continued its <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> on terrorism, particularly the presence of American troops and agencies in Pakistan. JI also called for restoration of judiciary.|$|E
25|$|Maurer's outspoken <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> {{hampered}} {{his support}} among his legislative constituents {{and he found}} his re-election efforts further challenged by a ban on public meetings enacted {{in an effort to}} slow the spread of deadly influenza.

25|$|<b>Opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> arose {{during a}} time of {{unprecedented}} student activism which followed the free speech movement and the civil rights movement. The military draft mobilized the baby boomers who were most at risk, but grew to include a varied cross-section of Americans. The growing opposition to the Vietnam War was partly attributed to greater access to uncensored information presented by the extensive television coverage on the ground in Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|Every {{effort by}} Võ Nguyên Giáp {{to break the}} De Lattre Line failed, and every attack he made was {{answered}} by a French counter-attack that destroyed his forces. Viet Minh casualties rose alarmingly during this period, leading some to question {{the leadership of the}} Communist government, even within the party. However, any benefit this may have reaped for France was negated by the increasing domestic <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> in France.|$|E
25|$|During the First World War the Labour Party {{split between}} {{supporters}} {{and opponents of}} the conflict but <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> grew within the party as time went on.

25|$|The Bisbee Deportations {{were later}} {{used by some}} proponents as an {{argument}} in favor of stronger laws against unpopular speech. Such laws would be justified as empowering the government to suppress disloyal speech and activity, and remove the need for citizens groups to take actions the government could not. During World War I, the federal government used the Sedition Act of 1918 to prosecute people for statements in <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b>|$|E
25|$|Though {{some critics}} charged that Jewish {{interests}} were partially {{responsible for the}} push to war with Iraq, Jewish Americans were actually more strongly opposed to the Iraq war from its onset than any other religious group, or even most Americans. The greater <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> {{was not simply a}} result of high Democratic identification among U.S. Jews, as Jews of all political persuasions were more likely to oppose the war than non-Jews who shared the same political leanings.|$|E
25|$|The International grew {{substantially}} in the 1960s, alongside most other left-wing groups. The April 1969 Ninth World Congress in Italy gathered 100 delegates and observers from 30 countries including new sections in Ireland, Luxembourg and Sweden and rebuilt ones in France, Mexico, Spain and Switzerland. It adopted a major resolution on the deepening youth radicalisation. Over {{the following years}} its sections continued to grow principally through campaigns in <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> in Vietnam, though the student and youth radicalisation.|$|E
