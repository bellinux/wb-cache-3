In some areas, it is much more common; for instance, in the French region of Haut Jura the rate is 1:2351 - twice as common as in other populations. This has been attributed to a founder effect, in which a population descending from a small number of ancestors has a high rate <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> genetic trait because one of these ancestors harbored this trait.
