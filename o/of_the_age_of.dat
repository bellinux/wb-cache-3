5|$|In 1836, Walter Savage Landor, an English {{writer and}} poet, {{published}} Pericles and Aspasia, {{one of his}} most famous books. Pericles and Aspasia is a rendering of classical Athens through a series of imaginary letters, which contain numerous poems. The letters are frequently unfaithful to actual history but attempt to capture the spirit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Age</b> <b>of</b> Pericles. Robert Hamerling is another novelist and poet who was inspired by Aspasia's personality. In 1876 he published his novel Aspasia, a book about the manners and morals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Age</b> <b>of</b> Pericles and a work of cultural and historical interest. Giacomo Leopardi, an Italian poet influenced by the movement of romanticism, published a group of five poems known as the circle of Aspasia. These Leopardi poems were inspired by his painful experience of desperate and unrequited love for a woman named Fanny Targioni Tozzetti. Leopardi called this person Aspasia, after the companion of Pericles.|$|E

5|$|According to Paine {{scholars}} Edward Davidson and William Scheick, {{he probably}} {{wrote the first}} draft of Part I in late 1793, but Paine biographer David Hawke argues for a date of early 1793. It is also unclear whether or not a French edition of Part I was published in 1793. François Lanthenas, who translated The Age of Reason into French in 1794, wrote that it was first published in France in 1793, but no book fitting his description has been positively identified.

5|$|At birth, a {{rattlesnake}} hatchling {{has only a}} small button or 'primordial rattle' which is firmly attached {{to the tip of}} the tail. The first segment is added when the hatchling sheds its skin for the first time. A new section is added each time the skin is shed until a rattle is formed. The rattle grows as the snake ages but segments are also prone to breaking off and hence the length of a rattle is not a reliable indicator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> a snake.|$|E

5|$|Following Thomas Williams's {{sentence}} of one year's hard labor for publishing The Age of Reason in 1797, no editions were sold openly in Britain until 1818 when Richard Carlile included {{it in an}} edition of Paine's complete works. Carlile charged one shilling and sixpence for the work, and the first run of 1,000 copies sold out in a month. He immediately published a second edition of 3,000 copies. Like Williams, he was prosecuted for seditious libel and blasphemous libel. The prosecutions surrounding the printing <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Age</b> <b>of</b> Reason in Britain continued for thirty years after its initial release and encompassed numerous publishers as well as over a hundred booksellers.|$|E
5|$|Globular {{clusters}} normally {{consist of}} Population II stars, {{which have a}} low proportion of elements other than hydrogen and helium when compared to Population I stars such as the Sun. Astronomers refer to these heavier elements as metals and to the proportions of these elements as the metallicity. These elements are produced by stellar nucleosynthesis and then are recycled into the interstellar medium, where they enter {{the next generation of}} stars. Hence the proportion of metals can be an indication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> a star, with older stars typically having a lower metallicity.|$|E
5|$|However, further {{excavations}} {{revealed that}} the 8th-century temple was constructed over the remains of an older brick temple. According to Thirumoorthy, the garbhagriha or sanctum sanctorum of the brick temple was filled with sand and covered with granite slabs upon which the newer temple was constructed. Sathyamurthy, Superintendent, ASI Chennai Circle, said that the brick temple could be dated to the Sangam period as the shrine faced north unlike modern temples which face either east or west. This proved conclusively that the temple was constructed before the 6th or 7th century AD when the shilpa shastras, the canonical texts of temple architecture, were written. Estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> the brick shrine range from 1700 to 2200 years.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1990s, {{observations}} of certain globular clusters appeared to indicate, {{that they were}} about 15billion years old, which conflicted with most then-current estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> the universe (and indeed with the age measured today). This issue was later resolved when new computer simulations, which included the effects of mass loss due to stellar winds, indicated a much younger age for globular clusters.

5|$|Lyrical poets {{often took}} their {{subjects}} from myth, but their treatment became gradually less narrative and more allusive. Greek lyric poets, including Pindar, Bacchylides and Simonides, and bucolic poets such as Theocritus and Bion, relate individual mythological incidents. Additionally, myth {{was central to}} classical Athenian drama. The tragic playwrights Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides took most of their plots from myths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> heroes and the Trojan War. Many of the great tragic stories (e.g. Agamemnon and his children, Oedipus, Jason, Medea, etc.) took on their classic form in these tragedies. The comic playwright Aristophanes also used myths, in The Birds and The Frogs.|$|E
5|$|Piattoli {{traveled}} through Europe in the retinue of the Lubomirski family, including Izabela, {{and as a}} tutor of young Henryk Lubomirski. During that time he developed extensive contacts at various European courts in Courland, Austria (Vienna), Italy (Turin) and France (Paris). During his three-year stay in the Lubomirskis' Parisian residence, he was in touch with many important men <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Age</b> <b>of</b> Enlightenment. He met—often through another Florentinian, Filippo Mazzei—Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Thomas Jefferson, the Marquis de Lafayette, Luigi Landriani, Girolamo Lucchesini, and the Marquis de Condorcet. He also corresponded with J. G. Herder. In Poland, he developed close contacts with Ignacy Potocki and Julian Ursyn Niemcewicza. From 1787 he also tutored Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, later an important politician in the Russian Empire, on whom Piattoli would retain significant influence.|$|E
