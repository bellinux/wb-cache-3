5|$|An <b>overhead</b> or {{penetration}} diving {{environment is}} where the diver enters a space from {{which there is no}} direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable atmosphere at the surface. Cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and diving inside other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent increases the risk of diving under an <b>overhead,</b> and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit.|$|E
50|$|There are {{essentially}} {{two types of}} business <b>overheads.</b> Administrative <b>overheads</b> and manufacturing <b>overheads.</b>|$|R
50|$|Manufacturing <b>overheads</b> are {{all costs}} endured by a {{business}} that is within the physical platform in which the product or service is created. Difference between manufacturing <b>overheads</b> and administrative <b>overheads</b> is that manufacturing <b>overheads</b> are categorized within a factory or office in which the sale takes place. Whilst administrative <b>overheads</b> is typically categorized within some sort of back-office or supporting office. Although there are cases when the two physical buildings may overlap, it is the usage of the <b>overheads</b> that separates them.|$|R

5|$|Images 4 and 5 assume an <b>overhead</b> {{stream that}} is totally {{condensed}} into a liquid product using water or air-cooling. However, in many cases, the tower <b>overhead</b> is not easily condensed totally and the reflux drum must include a vent gas outlet stream. In yet other cases, the <b>overhead</b> stream may also contain water vapor because either the feed stream contains some water or some steam is injected into the distillation tower (which {{is the case in}} the crude oil distillation towers in oil refineries). In those cases, if the distillate product is insoluble in water, the reflux drum may contain a condensed liquid distillate phase, a condensed water phase and a non-condensible gas phase, which makes it necessary that the reflux drum also have a water outlet stream.|$|E

40|$|Performance tuning {{programs}} for dataflow execution involves tradeoffs and optimizations {{which may be}} significantly different than for execution on conventional machines. We examine some tuning techniques for scientific programs with regular control but irregular geometry. We use as an example the core of an ocean modeling code developed in the implicitly parallel language Id for the Monsoon dataflow machine. Dataflow implementations of loops, in particular, require careful examination by the compiler or programmer to attain high performance because of <b>overheads</b> due to fine-grained synchronization, control, and operand distribution. 1. Introduction Dataflow machines have two basic types of <b>overheads</b> which do not exist in sequential machines: synchronization and control <b>overheads.</b> Synchronization <b>overheads</b> are primarily encountered within basic blocks, and control <b>overheads</b> are encounteredbetween basic blocks (on conditional, loop, and procedure call boundaries).

40|$|Abstract. Project <b>overheads</b> are {{allocated}} on {{a percentage}} basis to project costs and common to maintain multiple cost objects, but cannot directly {{be distributed to}} construction activities. Construction project <b>overheads</b> have to be identified their cost behaviours properly in order to sustain Cost Management and Controlling Practices (CMCPs) during the construction stage. The literature review method identified forty seven (47) project <b>overheads</b> and categorised into four hierarchies (unit, batch, project, and facility levels). Therefore, the identification of project <b>overheads</b> should enable a sustainable improvement to the CMCPs in construction projects...|$|R

30|$|Using SR cooperation, {{the total}} energy {{consumption}} {{consists of the}} consumed energy on the SR and the LR links, {{in addition to the}} <b>overheads</b> resulting from cooperation. <b>Overheads</b> can include node discovery, context aware functionalities (context gathering, maintenance and distribution), cluster functionalities (cluster formation, cluster maintenance, etc.).

The <b>overheads</b> related to MCP can be divided into two main categories.|$|R

These <b>overheads</b> include data-touching operations, {{such as the}} checksum computation and data movemen ~ which are well known to be major time consumers. In this stud y, we also considered <b>overheads</b> due to non-data touching operations, such as network buffer manipulation, protocol-specific processing, operating system functions, data structure manipulations (other than network buffers), and error checking. We show that when one considers realistic message size dktributions, {{where the majority of}} messages are small, the cumulative time consumed by the nondata touching <b>overheads</b> represents the majority of processing time.

40|$|Advances in {{multiprocessor}} interconnect {{technology are}} leading to high performance networks. However, software <b>overheads</b> associated with message passing are limiting the processors to get maximum performance from these networks, leading to under-utilization of network resources.

In this paper we take an alternative approach and analyze on how to exploit emerging processor-cluster technology for designing high-performance and cost-effective parallel systems given that messaging <b>overheads</b> can limit maximum performance.

40|$|Communication <b>overheads</b> {{are one of}} the {{fundamental}} challenges in a multiprocessor system. As the number of processors on a chip increases, communication <b>overheads</b> and the distribution of computation and data become increasingly significant. The granularity of communication between processors on a single chip in future systems will determine how significant these <b>overheads</b> will be. Fine-grained communication may expose more parallelism, but at the cost of higher <b>overheads.</b> Coarser-grained communication limits the impact of these <b>overheads,</b> but {{it may be difficult to}} expose the same degree of parallelism without the benefits of fine-grained communication. In this work, we attempt to show that the compiler can be effectively used to minimize these fine-grained communication delays in an EDGE processor.
