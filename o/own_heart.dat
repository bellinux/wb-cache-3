5|$|Moving on to 300 AF Cocoon, {{the pair}} find Snow {{fighting}} a giant paradox-fueled monster that is dissolving the crystal pillar. After resolving the paradox, which delays {{the fall of}} Cocoon until 500 AF, Snow disappears again as an anomaly from another time. The pair {{then go to the}} city of Academia on Gran Pulse in 400 AF where they are attacked by the city's AI, which claims they were killed in 200 AF. Traveling to 200 AF, they discover a paradox whereby a man-made fal'Cie meant to re-levitate Cocoon was able to turn on its creators using the AI that designed it and take over the government. Resolving the paradox, Noel and Serah travel to an alternative 400 AF Academia. In this world, the pair find Hope and Alyssa again, who had put themselves in stasis. They explain their new plan to mechanically float a new Cocoon to hold humanity, which Serah and Noel help with before heading to 500 AF Academia. They are betrayed by Alyssa (revealed to be a living paradox doomed to disappear in the corrected timeline) and trapped by Caius in dream-worlds. Before being trapped, Serah meets the spirit of Yeul, who explains that she is the seeress of Paddra, continually reincarnated throughout history, while Caius is her immortal guardian, gifted with Etro's <b>own</b> <b>heart.</b>|$|E

25|$|The town's {{population}} {{has grown from}} 28,000 in the 1960s to almost 72,000 in 2011 due in the main to new housing developments, including many London overspill housing estates, built to ease pressure on the capital, and to move people from crowded inner city slums to more favourable locations. Indeed, Aylesbury, {{to a greater extent}} than many English market towns, saw substantial areas of its <b>own</b> <b>heart</b> demolished in the 1950s/1960s as 16th–18th century houses (many in good repair) were demolished to make way for new, particularly retail, development.|$|E
25|$|Sailor Galaxia's past is {{eventually}} revealed. She once ended the Sailor Wars by sealing Chaos — {{the source of}} all malice — within her body. Unable to resist Chaos's influence, she separated her Star Seed from her body, and it took the form of Chibichibi. Sailor Galaxia steals the Star Seeds of Usagi's companions, resulting in their deaths. This includes Mamoru who was targeted before he arrived in the United States. Chibichibi transforms into the Sword of Sealing and urges Usagi to kill Sailor Galaxia. However, Usagi instead uses the kindness in her <b>own</b> <b>heart</b> to free Sailor Galaxia of Chaos's corruption, effectively resurrecting all of the Sailor Soldiers whose Star Seeds were taken. With normalcy restored, Usagi and Mamoru share a kiss under a full moon.|$|E
25|$|Seeking {{refuge from}} the waswās means that the seeker after refuge himself seeks God's refuge from its evil, i.e. from the evil lest it should whisper some evil {{suggestion}} into his <b>own</b> <b>heart.</b> The second meaning is that the caller to truth seeks God's {{refuge from the}} evil {{of the one who}} whispers evil suggestions into the hearts of the people against himself. It is not in his own power to approach all the people in whose hearts evil suggestions are being whispered against himself individually and remove the misunderstandings of every person. It is also not right and proper for him that he should give up his mission of inviting others to God and should devote all his tune and energy to removing the misunderstanding created by the whisperer and to answering their accusations. It is also below his dignity that he should stoop to the level of his opponents. Therefore, God has instructed the caller to truth to seek only His refuge from the evil of the wicked people, and then to attend single-mindedly to his work of invitation and mission. For it is not for him to deal with them but for God, who is Sustainer of men, King of men, God of men.|$|E

500|$|Donna's {{relationship}} with Michael proved unpopular with critics. In an editorial discussing {{the boundaries between}} fiction and reality, The Guardian Scott Murray and Barney Ronay declared their love for Donna, commending the way she [...] "always has time for people" [...] and recommending that she stay away from Michael as she deserves better. Bree Treacy of RTÉ.ie believes that Michael had better chemistry with Donna than with his wife Annalese, however similarly commented {{that he did not}} deserve Donna, never having seen her as more than [...] "a notch on his stethoscope". Following her promotion to ward sister, Treacy hoped that the series producers would give Donna a man who would see her [...] "as more than just a good time girl." [...] Simon criticized Donna for failing to observe correct organ donation protocol in an attempt to win Michael's affection, commenting that she had [...] "thrown her <b>own</b> <b>heart</b> willynilly at the first good-looking doctor she s with an ego the size of Texas." [...] She later branded her [...] "selfish to a fault" [...] for her negative reaction to Kieran's posting to Afghanistan, but opined that Kieran [...] "makes a far more suitable partner for her" [...] than Michael did.|$|E
500|$|Ryder {{landed the}} role of Veronica Sawyer in the {{independent}} film Heathers (1988). The film, a satirical take on teenage life, revolves around Veronica, who is ultimately {{forced to choose between}} the will of society and her <b>own</b> <b>heart</b> after her boyfriend, played by Christian Slater, begins killing off popular high school students. Ryder's agent initially begged her to turn the role down, saying the film would [...] "ruin her career". Reaction to the film was largely positive, and Ryder's performance was critically embraced, with The Washington Post stating Ryder is [...] "Hollywood's most impressive ingénue...Ryder...makes us love her teen-age murderess, a bright, funny girl with a little Bonnie Parker in her. She is the most likable, best-drawn young adult protagonist since the sexual innocent of Gregory's Girl." [...] The film was a box office flop, yet achieved status as a predominant cult film. Later that year, she starred in Great Balls of Fire!, playing the 13-year-old bride (and cousin) of Jerry Lee Lewis. The film was a box office failure and received divided reviews from critics. Also in 1988, Ryder played in the film, 1969 where she played the character, Beth, the girlfriend of Kiefer Sutherland and sister of Robert Downey, Jr.—protagonists, protesters and flower children against the Vietnam War.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} {{was published in the}} The Moving Picture World on June 18, 1910. It states: [...] "Tom Taylor, the owner of a pretty rustic cottage, where he lives all alone, believes himself to be a woman hater, and reproaches his friend John Sparks, when the latter tries to ornament the cottage with posters of women. Taylor's property is valuable, and {{at the opening of the}} play a financier purchases it at a satisfactory figure. To close the deal, Taylor is obliged to go to the financier's hotel, and there he attracts the attention of four pretty young girl guests. One of them, Lou Bennett (played by Violet Heming), asks John to introduce Tom. This John declines to do on the grounds that Tom is a woman hater. Lou bets the other girls that she can make Tom fall in love with her and propose to her within a week. They take the bet, not knowing Tom's name or where he lives. They follow his horse, borrowing a buggy built for two, that is waiting outside the hotel. Lou meets Tom, and wins her bet - he falls in love with her. But, incidentally, the girl loses her <b>own</b> <b>heart.</b> Tom finds that he has been tricked, and is preparing to go away forever, when Lou arrives, speaks with him, and all ends nicely." ...|$|E

500|$|... {{appears in}} Final Fantasy XIII-2 {{as the main}} antagonist. Hailing from the distant past prior to the War of Transgression, Caius is a former Pulse l'Cie who became the Guardian of the seeress Paddra Nsu-Yeul. At some point, to protect the seeress and her city from an invading army, Caius {{transforms}} himself into a Bahamut Eidolon, thus killing himself to save her. Etro, touched by his sacrifice, gives him her <b>own</b> <b>heart,</b> the Heart of Chaos, so he could become Yeul's eternal guardian and eventually as the living repository for his visions. However, this gift soon turns into a curse, as seeing Yuel die repeatedly makes him hateful towards Etro, attempting to condition Noel to be his killer before deciding to enter Valhalla and kill the goddess personally. As Serah and Noel encounter the past versions of him during their journey, Caius uses {{his knowledge of the}} timeline to create the various paradoxes they deal with while he battles Lightning in Valhalla. After barely managing to defeat her, Caius enters a final battle with Noel and Serah. Eventually, after being defeated in his Eidolon form and with Noel still refusing to kill him, Caius manages to force Noel's blade through himself, destroying Etro's heart. Though he seems to die, he is later seen in the game's secret ending, seated on Etro's throne and saying that he and Yeul can begin their lives in the [...] "new world".|$|E
500|$|Battles in The Thousand-Year Door borrow {{elements}} from Super Mario RPG {{and the first}} original Paper Mario game. The turn-based system, in which players select an attack, defense, or item from a menu, is augmented by timed button presses that can result in substantial attack or defence bonuses when performed correctly. A similar [...] "action command" [...] was also used in all released Mario RPG games. [...] In The Thousand-Year Door, each of Mario's party members now have their <b>own</b> <b>heart</b> points (HP) and may receive any attack that Mario can receive. When a partner's heart points are reduced to 0, the partner becomes inactive {{for the rest of}} that battle and later battles until recovery. If Mario's Heart Points are reduced to 0, however, the game ends. Flower Points—which are required for special moves—are shared among Mario and his party members. Defeating enemies awards various numbers of Star Points to Mario; for every 100 Star Points, Mario is able to level up. Mario can choose to upgrade his heart points (HP), flower points (FP), or his badge points (BP). The battles take place on a stage in front of an audience; if the player performs well in a battle, the audience can assist Mario by replenishing star power, throwing helpful items on-stage, or inflicting damage on the opponent. Conversely, the audience may throw damage-causing items at the player or leave if the player performs poorly in a battle. For every 10 levels, the stage will increase by fifty audience members for a total of 200 after level 30.|$|E
500|$|Fralic also {{described}} the character as being [...] "quixotic", who is [...] "deeply layered with arrogance and angst, imbued {{with all the}} failings and bravado that a true villain possesses, his dastardly deeds leaving him most recently responsible {{not only for the}} death of his <b>own</b> <b>heart</b> donor, but for the near-death of his granddaughter Summer from peanut poisoning". She also noted that he's been jailed, thrown in a psychiatric ward and shot, had amnesia, epilepsy among other events, but [...] "like all villains worth their salt, he's survived it all and inspired respect, if not adoration". Braeden describes the character as [...] "the villain" [...] and as [...] "defensive and always self-protective", stating that he's [...] "not here to win a popularity contest". He stated that he enjoys portraying Victor [...] "more than anything", also describing him as [...] "very complex". Braeden said that [...] "he fought himself to the position he arrived at a number of years ago", and that [...] "he obviously doesn't suffer fools easily, doesn't suffer enemies easily. He wants relationships badly, but doesn't quite trust them. It's a tragic flaw in him because of his childhood." [...] The actor, comparing himself to the character, noted that he is nothing like Victor, stating: [...] "Money makes a lot of things happen for Victor. My God almighty, that's something else that I, Eric Braeden, would never do. I always confront things directly. But when that doesn't work for Victor, he gets out his wallet [...] If you are abusive to him, he will be abusive to you. No one gets away with that. I will not allow anyone to cross that line with the character." ...|$|E

500|$|The second option had European precedents, {{including}} Edward's own great-grandfather, Duke Alexander of Württemberg, {{but it had}} no {{parallel in}} British constitutional history. The prime ministers of the five Dominions (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the Irish Free State) were consulted, and the majority agreed that there was [...] "no alternative to course (3)". William Lyon Mackenzie King (Prime Minister of Canada), Joseph Lyons (Prime Minister of Australia), and J. B. M. Hertzog (Prime Minister of South Africa) opposed options 1 and 2. Mackenzie King told Edward to do [...] "what he believed in his <b>own</b> <b>heart</b> was right" [...] and the Canadian government appealed to the King to put his duty before his feelings for Simpson. Governor General of Canada Lord Tweedsmuir told Buckingham Palace and Baldwin that Canadians held deep affection for the King, but also that Canadian public opinion would be outraged if Edward married a divorcee. Michael Joseph Savage (Prime Minister of New Zealand) rejected option 1 and thought that option 2 [...] "might be possible... if some solution along these lines {{were found to be}} practicable", but [...] "would be guided by the decision of the Home government". In communications with the British government, Éamon de Valera (President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State) remarked that as a Roman Catholic country, the Irish Free State did not recognise divorce. He supposed that if the British people would not accept Wallis Simpson then abdication was the only possible solution. On 24 November, Baldwin consulted the three leading opposition politicians in Britain: Leader of the Opposition Clement Attlee, Liberal leader Sir Archibald Sinclair, and Winston Churchill. Sinclair and Attlee agreed that options 1 and 2 were unacceptable, and Churchill pledged to support the government.|$|E
