5|$|A severe drought from 1130 to 1180 led {{to rapid}} {{depopulation}} {{in many parts}} of the San Juan Basin, particularly at Chaco Canyon. As the extensive Chacoan system collapsed, people increasingly migrated to Mesa Verde, causing major population growth in the area. This led to much larger settlements of six to eight hundred people, which reduced mobility for Mesa Verdeans, who had in the past frequently relocated their dwellings and fields as part of their agriculture strategy. In order to sustain these larger populations, they dedicated more and more <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>labor</b> to farming. Population increases also led to expanded tree felling that reduced habitat for many wild plant and animal species that the Mesa Verdeans had relied on, further deepening their dependency on domesticated crops that were susceptible to drought-related failure.|$|E

Due to the poor economy, low cotton prices and difficulty of getting credit, many of these farmers could not make it through the extended financial difficulties. Two decades later, the majority of African Americans were sharecroppers.

They made $64,000 off the sales from the cherry tomatoes, and used that money to purchase land. In 1974, the Lopez-De La Cruz family and three other families decided to purchase 40 acres near Raisin City, CA and started their own cooperative farm selling cherry tomatoes and other produce to local and national sellers.

25|$|The {{outbreak}} {{of war in}} Europe in 1914 reduced European immigration to the United States to a trickle, and the low wage labor supply that filled Northern factories contracted sharply. With U.S. entry into the War on April 16, 1917, the military draft depleted the labor pool even further. Lured by manufacturing jobs {{and the promise of}} a better life in the North, Blacks began a massive migration to Northern industrial centers, and by 1920 over 300,000 had relocated to Detroit, Chicago, St. Louis, and Cleveland. The sudden exodus <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>labor</b> pool, and therefore their economic security, sent alarm throughout White communities in the South. Whites in the North reacted with similar consternation over the influx of Blacks into their cities. Southern White anger over increasing race assertiveness of Blacks, and Northern White concerns about Black migration, led to more virulent racism and frequent outbreaks of racial violence. After the War ended on November 11, 1918, the tense atmosphere exploded during the summer of 1919. On April 2, 1917, the United States declared war on Germany, ushering a period of social, racial, and political turbulence.|$|E

2500|$|Butler {{had already}} done the {{institution}} of slavery in the Confederacy considerable damage by instituting his “contraband of war” policy while commanding Fort Monroe on the Virginia peninsula. This policy rationalized the retention of slaves fleeing the seceding states by claiming that the Confederate military was using slave labor for military use {{in the construction of}} fortifications, moving military supplies, and constructing roads and railroad grades of use to the Confederate army. Slaves within areas of Confederate control rapidly spread the word that Union military forces were not enforcing the fugitive slave laws, and that slaves could find refuge within Union military lines and employment as laborers for the Union armies. As a result, the use of slaves in the proximity of Union forces became extremely difficult and expensive, since these slaves would flee at first opportunity to Union lines, depriving the Confederate armies <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>labor</b> and their former masters of what they regarded as their valuable property. Since the Confederate government was counting on slave labor to offset the greater numbers of Union soldiers, Butler’s innovative policy struck the Confederacy at a strategic level, destroying an asset counted on to win the military struggle for independence. The flight of the slaves {{in the direction of the}} Union also diverted the resources of the Confederate military and its government in defense of the plantations and the discipline <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>labor</b> forces. The planters of Louisiana even appealed for aid from Union authorities, to quote one of them, “Our family has owned negroes for generations… we have no one but yourself and Genls Shepley and Butler to protect us against these negroes in a state of insurrection.” The plantations of Jefferson Davis, located in the state of Mississippi on Davis Bend [...] downriver from Vicksburg, were also disrupted by the Union invasion. After Davis' older brother Joseph fled the area with some of the slaves in May 1862, the rest revolted, took possession of the property, and betrayed the location of valuables to Union forces and resisted any efforts by Confederate forces to recapture the area. The slaves in rebellion armed themselves with guns and newspapers, and fought to the death any attempts to infringe upon their newfound freedom. This rebellion within a rebellion began to erode Confederate authority within Louisiana the instant Butler's troops appeared in New Orleans, and as a political fifth column was invaluable to his occupation.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a purely}} {{capitalist}} mode of production (i.e. where professional and labor organizations cannot {{limit the number}} of workers) the workers wages will not be controlled by these organizations, or by the employer, but rather by the market. Wages work {{in the same way as}} prices for any other good. Thus, wages can be considered as a function of market price of skill. And therefore, inequality is driven by this price. Under the law of supply and demand, the price of skill is determined by a race between the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker. [...] "On the other hand, markets can also concentrate wealth, pass environmental costs on to society, and abuse workers and consumers." [...] "Markets, by themselves, even when they are stable, often lead to high levels of inequality, outcomes that are widely viewed as unfair." [...] Employers who offer a below market wage will find that their business is chronically understaffed. Their competitors will take advantage of the situation by offering a higher wage the best <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>labor.</b> For a businessman who has the profit motive as the prime interest, it is a losing proposition to offer below or above market wages to workers.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{collapse}} of the Confederacy, Polish foreign labor was desired to work on Southern farms as replacements for black slaves. Several such societies were founded in Texas, largely by private planters, but in 1871, Texas funded immigration of Europeans through direct state aid (Texas Bureau of Immigration). The Waverly Emigration Society, formed in 1867 in Walker County, Texas, by several planters, dispatched Meyer Levy, a Polish Jew, to Poland to acquire roughly 150 Poles to pick cotton. He sailed to Poland and brought back farm laborers, who arrived in New Waverly, Texas, in May 1867. The agreement the Poles had with the plantation owners was that the farmers would be paid $90 (...) , $100 ($), and $110 ($) per year for three years <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>labor,</b> while the owners provided them with a [...] "comfortable cabin" [...] and food. Poles paid back their owners for the ship tickets to America, often in installments. By 1900, after years working on Southerners' farms, Poles had [...] "bought almost all the farmland" [...] in New Waverly, and were expanding their land ownership to the surrounding areas. New Waverly served as a mother colony for future Polish immigrants to the United States, as many arriving Poles lived and worked there before moving on to other Polonias in the U.S. Polish farmers commonly worked directly with southern blacks in east Texas, and they were commonly in direct competition for agricultural jobs. Blacks frequently picked up a few words of Polish and Poles picked up some of the black English dialect in these areas during the late 19th century. R. L. Daniels in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine wrote a piece on [...] "Polanders" [...] in Texas in 1888, praising their industriousness and hard work ethic. He cited instances where Polish farmers called their landlords , denoting a subordinate position on level with slavery, and, when asking a woman why she left Poland, she replied 'Mudder haf much childs and 'Nough not to eat all". Daniels found that the Poles were efficient farmers, and planted corn and cotton so close to their homes as not to leave even elbow room to the nearby buildings. Texas blacks, referred to Poles as dem white niggahs' whom they hold in undisguised contempt" [...] were apparently stunned by their high literacy rates, according to Daniels.|$|E
