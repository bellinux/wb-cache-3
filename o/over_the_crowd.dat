5|$|Arya, who {{has been}} living as a beggar {{in the streets of}} King's Landing since her escape from the Lannisters, learns a crowd is {{gathering}} at the Great Sept of Baelor, where her father will be judged before the gods, and in order to see <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> climbs onto the statue of Baelor the Blessed. As he is dragged through the crowd, Ned notices Arya on the statue, and alerts the Night's Watch recruiter Yoren to her location. With Sansa, Cersei, Joffrey and the Small Council looking over him, Ned confesses to treason and swears fealty to Joffrey in front of the crowd. Satisfied, Sansa and Cersei ask Joffrey to spare Ned as Joffrey promised, but Joffrey breaks his promise and orders Ned to be executed. As Sansa watches in horror, Cersei, Varys and the Small Council attempt to intervene, and Arya tries to rescue Ned, only to be stopped by Yoren, who prevents her from seeing her father's execution. When he sees that Arya has been rescued, Ned accepts his fate and is beheaded by Ser Ilyn Payne.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{is named}} Northeastern Pennsylvania Salesman of the Year and {{must make a}} speech at an {{association}} meeting at the Radisson Lackawanna Station Hotel, getting some assistance from Michael Scott (Steve Carell). Before he leaves, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), in retaliation for Dwight's cocky attitude, gives him {{tips on how to}} give public speeches. Unknown to Dwight, Jim's tips are taken from a speech by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, the fascist dictator of Italy from 1922 to 1943. When Michael and Dwight make it to the convention, Dwight gets cold feet and Michael goes up and tries to relive his glory days of winning Salesman of the Year two years in a row, but ends up bombing. Dwight finally works up the nerve to give his speech and, using Jim's advice, wins <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> with a passionate yet unorthodox speech, which Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) videotapes from the back. Michael ends up leaving the convention room and later entertains Dwight with his tales at the bar.|$|E
5|$|On 26 October 1959, Vulcan B.1 XH498 {{participated in}} an airshow marking the opening of Wellington International Airport, {{formerly}} Rongotai Airport. After a ' touch-and-go landing' on Runway 34, it came around for a full stop landing. Turbulence and wind shear caused XH498 to land short of the runway threshold, the port undercarriage leg clipped the embankment at the Moa Point or southern end, damaging wing attachments, engine fuel lines and the main landing gear drag link, which was ruptured and unable to support the aircraft. The port wing tip nearly scraped the runway surface before {{it was able to}} lift off again, spilling fuel <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> Pilot actions prevented a possible disaster as spectators were present on the western apron. XH498 flew to RNZAF Ohakea for a safe emergency landing on just the nose and starboard landing gear with little further damage. A UK repair team returned it to airworthiness; on 4 January 1960, XH498 departed, remaining in service until 19 October 1967.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a general}} laugh in the court, which was {{instantly}} repressed. Mr. Faulkner's eyes ran furiously <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> benches.|$|R
25|$|Unlike the 2009 and the 2008 postcards, the 2010 postcards {{were based}} in {{simplicity}} but also included an innovative idea, they are shown {{like they could}} be seen right in <b>the</b> venue, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd's</b> heads.|$|R
60|$|But now {{the shouts}} {{of a vast}} {{concourse}} of amazed spectators reached the boy's ears. He remembered that he was suspended in mid-air <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> street of a great city, while thousands of wondering eyes were fixed upon him.|$|R
5|$|The libertines' {{downfall}} {{began with}} the February 1555 elections. By then, many of the French refugees had been granted citizenship and with their support, Calvin's partisans elected {{the majority of the}} syndics and the councillors. On 16 May the libertines took to the streets in a drunken protest and attempted to burn down a house that was supposedly full of Frenchmen. The syndic Henri Aulbert tried to intervene, carrying with him the baton of office that symbolised his power. Perrin seized the baton and waved it <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> which gave the appearance that he was taking power and initiating a coup d'état. The insurrection was soon over when another syndic appeared and ordered Perrin to go with him to the town hall. Perrin and other leaders were forced to flee the city. With the approval of Calvin, the other plotters who remained in the city were found and executed. The opposition to Calvin's church polity came to an end.|$|E
5|$|Eight hundred dancers auditioned to be {{included}} in Beyoncé's performance at the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show and a selected group of them, consisting only of females, were chosen for the performance {{as well as for the}} tour. French dancing duo Les Twins also accompanied Beyoncé on stage performing street dances. Three backing singers The Mamas, and an eleven-piece female band who had also supported the singer during her previous tours performed during the concerts. Two stages were used during the performances: a main stage where the singer performed throughout most of the concert and a B-stage closer to the audience where she was transferred with a rope, flying <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> midway through the set, performing three songs there. The set list of the 2013 portion of the tour included approximately twenty five songs from Beyoncé's four solo studio albums: Dangerously in Love (2003), B'Day (2006), I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008), and 4 (2011). The majority of the songs originated from 4 – seven songs were performed from that album. Many of the tracks performed contained different choreographies and arrangements compared to the previous performances by the singer; several of them were intertwined with other artists' material. For the 2014 shows many of the previously performed songs were removed and eight new songs from Beyoncé's fifth self-titled studio album were added to the concert's set list.|$|E
25|$|The {{rally in}} Çanakkale started at 13:30 with an {{estimated}} participation of 25,000 people. A contingent of 400 police officers watched <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b>|$|E
25|$|The landing {{approach}} using runway 13 at Kai Tak {{was spectacular}} and world-famous. To land on runway 13, an aircraft first took a descent heading northeast. The aircraft would pass <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> harbour, {{and then the}} very densely populated areas of Western Kowloon. This leg of the approach was guided by an IGS (Instrument Guidance System, a modified ILS) after 1974.|$|R
6000|$|I {{turned from}} the group of trees and the [...] "merrie companie" [...] in its shade. Midnight was long past; <b>the</b> concert was <b>over,</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> were thinning. I {{followed}} the ebb. Leaving the radiant park and well-lit Haute-Ville (still well lit, this it seems {{was to be a}} [...] "nuit blanche" [...] in Villette), I sought the dim lower quarter.|$|R

25|$|During the demonstrations, flight above Tandoğan Square and Anıtkabir was banned. Twelve {{ambulances}} {{and eleven}} police APCs were kept at standby {{in the surrounding}} streets. A contingent of 10,000 police officers watched <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> but the demonstration ended peacefully.|$|E
25|$|In early 1979 Davis met Alex Higgins in {{the final}} of the Castle Open (an event hosted at Bernard Bennett's club in Southampton). Davis lost the match 5–1, having earlier {{defeated}} Willie Thorne 4–3 and Cliff Thorburn 4–1, but clearly won <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> at the event.|$|E
25|$|Cummings {{arrived at}} 5:30 pm and walked two laps of the track. George, caught in traffic, arrived shortly before 6:00 pm and climbed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> with a ladder as {{the risk of}} injury pushing through the crowd was too great. Nevertheless, both runners had to force {{their way through the}} crowds with their handlers.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the plaque}} {{was found in}} rocky soil, (local lingo : Bharad) the goddess {{came to be known}} as Bharadi. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> years, <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> have swelled to the extent where the queue found by devotees for 'Darshan' extends up to several kms.|$|R

25|$|At {{the age of}} 32, Prabhakar {{played his}} last ODI against Sri Lanka in the 1996 Cricket World Cup in New Delhi. He {{struggled}} to bowl well in the match and had to bowl off-spin in <b>the</b> last two <b>overs.</b> <b>The</b> <b>crowd</b> booed him off the ground. After 1996 World Cup, he was not selected for the Indian team's tour of England and retired.|$|R
25|$|A {{controversy}} developed when Kumar Sangakkara {{called the}} toss. The toss came up as heads, but the match referee Jeff Crowe {{did not hear}} the call <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> It was decided {{that there would be}} a re-toss. Sangakkara called heads as the coin was spun the second time. He won the re-toss and elected to bat.|$|E
25|$|Another legend {{holds that}} two priests saying divine liturgy <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> {{disappeared}} into the cathedral's walls as the first Turkish soldiers entered. According to the legend, the priests will appear again {{on the day that}} Constantinople returns to Christian hands. Another legend refers to the Marble King (Constantine XI), holding that an angel rescued the emperor when the Ottomans entered the city, turning him into marble and placing him in a cave under the earth near the Golden Gate, where he waits to be brought to life again (a variant of the sleeping hero legend).|$|E
25|$|As the Australians {{began their}} innings, {{it was clear}} that not enough time {{remained}} for them to make up the 341 runs by which they trailed. Almost immediately they were offered the light; and having accepted it, both teams had to return to the dressing rooms to wait for a formal finish. The situation became somewhat farcical. With the match effectively <b>over,</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> were eager for the Ashes to be presented to England, and the celebrations to begin. After a period of some uncertainty and confusion, at 18:17 BST umpires Koertzen and Bowden removed the bails and pulled up the stumps to signal the end of the match. With no result in this fifth and final Test, England took the series 2–1, regaining the Ashes {{for the first time since}} 1987.|$|E

500|$|Slap-Happy was {{released}} on August 24, 1999 on vinyl and CD. A different version of [...] "Freeway" [...] {{was released}} by the online record label Atomic Pop in February 1999. To promote the album, a plane flew <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> during the Lilith Fair concert tour at the Rose Bowl stadium in Pasadena, California on July 17, 1999, with a banner that read: [...] "Bored? Tired? Try L7." [...] The following day, an airplane towed a banner <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> during the Warped Tour at the Stone Pony lot in Asbury Park, New Jersey. The banner read: [...] "Warped Needs More Beaver, Love L7." [...] The band supported the album with a tour across the US that started on August 15, 1999 in San Diego, California and ended on September 24, 1999 in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. Bassist Janis Tanaka, formerly of the San Francisco band Stone Fox, joined the band {{as part of the}} touring group. The band also toured across Europe in 2000. Unlike previous L7 albums, Slap-Happy did not chart in either the US or the UK. In 2008, Sparks revealed that the album suffered dismal sales partly due to the poor distribution and support by Bong Load.|$|E
500|$|... "Fly on the Wall" [...] {{was one of}} {{the songs}} on the set list of Cyrus' first {{international}} concert tour, the Wonder World Tour. The performance began with two overhead screens displaying a frog catching a fly while two acrobats scaled imaginary walls. Cyrus and her dancers then emerged from a green tractor to begin the song. She wore an extravagant white dress with a feathered back and used elaborate choreography. At one point during the performance, Cyrus unexpectedly flew <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> for a few seconds. At the conclusion, Cyrus and her background dancers grouped together to perform a segment of the dance from Michael Jackson's [...] "Thriller" [...] music video. She performed it at the Rock in Rio concert in Lisbon, Portugal on May 29, 2010 and Madrid, Spain on June 4, 2010.|$|E
50|$|On the {{allotted day}} though, {{in front of}} the king and a huge crowd, he is not on a tall hill, as in all his practices, but simply a launch {{platform}} from the town wall... and the wind is wrong. He is required to fly <b>over</b> <b>the</b> river. <b>The</b> <b>crowd</b> jeer at his delays. He jumps and lands in the river. He clambers out and <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> chase him.|$|R
50|$|Victory laps can {{sometime}} become {{dangerous for}} the winner and the other drivers, since in many tracks the safety nets can be easily climbed <b>over</b> by <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> which then becomes an obstacle for the racers.|$|R
50|$|The next morning, a {{small army}} unit of 25 men arrived, but found itself confronted by a {{civilian}} Sinhalese mob of <b>over</b> 3,000. <b>The</b> <b>crowd</b> dispersed after <b>the</b> soldiers fired a Bren gun at them, killing three.|$|R
500|$|The {{band played}} much of Wish You Were Here on 5 July 1975 at the Knebworth music festival. Roy Harper, {{performing}} {{at the same}} event, on discovering that his stage costume was missing, proceeded to destroy one of Pink Floyd's vans, injuring himself in the process. [...] This delayed the normal setup procedure of the band's sound system. As a pair of World War II Spitfire aircraft had been booked to fly <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> during their entrance, the band {{were not able to}} delay their set. The result was that a power supply problem pushed Wright's keyboards completely out of tune, damaging the band's performance. At one point he left the stage, but the band were able to continue with a less sensitive keyboard, a piano and a simpler light show. Following a brief intermission, they returned to perform The Dark Side of the Moon, but critics displeased about being denied access backstage savaged the performance.|$|E
500|$|Barry Gibbs, the {{secretary}} of the Queensland Cricket Association and the manager of the Australian team, called the [...] "humiliation" [...] of Meckiff [...] "without a doubt the most dramatic and emotion-charged" [...] sporting moment he had witnessed. Egar's actions also ignited [...] "one of the most emotional crowd displays in Test history", as the public backed the paceman. During Meckiff's <b>over,</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> expressed strong disapproval of the umpire's calls. Half an hour before the close of the day's play, proceedings were suspended for two minutes as the crowd repeatedly chanted [...] "We want Meckiff". When play ended, spectators stormed the field and carried the fast bowler off the arena on their shoulders, hailing him as a hero. They returned to the field and formed two lanes, booing Egar from the ground. After this incident, the Queensland Police escorted the umpire to and from the match venue. The police presence at the ground was increased because of fears the crowd might attack Egar or Benaud. During the Second Test, which was [...] held in Meckiff's home town of Melbourne, Egar was given a police escort throughout the match after receiving death threats.|$|E
500|$|Oxford won {{the coin}} toss and elected {{to begin the}} game {{defending}} the Harleyford Road end of the stadium. [...] Charles Mackarness gave Oxford the lead after just ten minutes. [...] Following an Oxford corner kick, a melee developed {{in front of the}} Engineers' goal, and the ball fell to Mackarness, who shot it <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> of players and past goalkeeper William Merriman. [...] Frederick Patton doubled the lead ten minutes later after some skillful dribbling by captain Cuthbert Ottaway and Robert Vidal, who was nicknamed the [...] "prince of dribblers" [...] for his skill in that aspect of the game. [...] Oxford could have had a third goal when they managed to get the ball through the Engineers' goalposts, but the players did not appeal for the goal. [...] At the time, as in cricket, the officials were not permitted to award a goal unless the players appealed for it, thus no goal was given. [...] It is not recorded why the Oxford players never appealed. [...] The best effort for the Engineers came when Henry Renny-Tailyour's shot struck the goalpost. [...] Late in the game the [...] "Sappers" [...] mounted a series of attacks on the Oxford goal but were unable to score, being repeatedly thwarted by Nepean. [...] Oxford thus won 2–0 and secured the cup.|$|E
50|$|Gunkholing is a boating term {{referring}} to a type of cruising in shallow or shoal water, meandering from place to place, spending the nights in coves. The term refers to the gunk, or mud, typical of the creeks, coves, marshes, sloughs, and rivers that {{are referred to as}} gunkholes. While not necessary, gunkholers typically seek out the serenity of isolated anchorages <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> of marinas and popular bays, and a minimal draft is preferred, since gunkholers tend to go as far up and into the gunkholes as possible, seeking ever more inaccessible destinations.|$|R
50|$|Toxik's {{sound is}} unique and has {{inspired}} many other Scottish punk bands such as Ex-Cathedra. Fred is heavily interested and involved in folk music, and Dod (an accomplished piper in his own right) often started gigs playing his bagpipes which won <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> in Europe {{as it was a}} breath of fresh air. This fusion of Scottish folk and bagpipes combined with punk can now be heard in various bands such as Dropkick Murphys and The Real McKenzies. Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys rates Toxik Ephex as the best ever Scottish punk band.|$|R
5000|$|Numerous {{stories have}} been written about the horse, {{including}} the book [...] "Big Bum, The Story of Bret Hanover".
