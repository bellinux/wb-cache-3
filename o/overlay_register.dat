40|$|The {{author has}} {{reported}} the following significant results. A data set containing SKYLAB, LANDSAT, and topographic data has been <b>overlayed,</b> <b>registered,</b> and geometrically corrected to {{a scale of}} 1 : 24, 000. After geometrically correcting both sets of data, the SKYLAB data were overlayed on the LANDSAT data. Digital topographic data were then obtained, reformatted, and a data channel containing elevation information was then digitally overlayed onto the LANDSAT and SKYLAB spectral data. The 14, 039 square kilometers involving 2, 113, 776 LANDSAT pixels represents a relatively large data set available for digital analysis. The overlayed data set enables investigators to numerically analyze and compare two sources of spectral data and topographic data from any point in the scene. This capability is new and it will permit a numerical comparison of spectral response with elevation, slope, and aspect. Utilization of the spectral and topographic data together to obtain more accurate classifications of the various cover types present is feasible...|$|R

40|$|Designed {{specifically}} for high-performance color graphics, the Bt 481 A RAM-DAC supports three true-color modes: 15 -bit (5 : 5 : 5, 32 K colors) TARGA format, 16 -bit (5 : 6 : 5, 65 K colors) XGA format, and 24 -bit BGR (8 : 8 : 8, RGB/ BGR, 16. 8 M colors) true-color format. It also supports 8 -bit pseudo-color format (256 colors). The Bt 481 A has a 256 x 18 (24) lookup table RAM, 15 x 8 (24) <b>overlay</b> <b>registers,</b> and triple 8 -bit D/A converters. Both 6 - and 8 -bit color modes are supported. A power-down mode {{is available on}} the Bt 481 A to reduce power requirements when the analog outputs are not used. This is useful in laptop computer systems that require the option to drive an external RGB monitor. The Bt 481 A has on-chip analog output comparators to simplify diagnostics and debugging, with the result output onto the SENSE * pin.

40|$|Abstract This paper proposes {{embodied}} and manipulative interaction for handheld {{augmented reality}} games. We use camera-equipped mobile devices and marker-based interaction {{as a means}} for gesture-based control of games that incorporate physical and virtual aspects. In addition to being a controller that recognizes multiple game-dependent gestures, the mobile device displays the camera image and augments it with graphical overlays. The <b>overlays</b> are <b>registered</b> with objects and areas in the camera image. We have developed marker-based interaction techniques that capture the posture and movement of a device relative to a marker and thus enable manipulative control. We describe game prototypes that use ubiquitous product packaging and other passive media as backgrounds for handheld augmented reality games. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{technological}} and economical feasibility of using multispectral digital image data as acquired from the LANDSAT satellites {{in an ongoing}} operational forest information system was evaluated. Computer compatible multispectral scanner data secured from the LANDSAT satellites were demonstrated {{to be a significant}} contributor to ongoing information systems by providing the added dimensions of synoptic and repeat coverage of the Earth's surface. Major forest cover types of conifer, deciduous, mixed conifer-deciduous and non-forest, were classified well within the bounds of the statistical accuracy of the ground sample. Further, when overlayed with existing maps, the acreage of cover type retains a high level of positional integrity. Maps were digitized by a graphics design system, <b>overlayed</b> and <b>registered</b> onto LANDSAT imagery such that the map data with associated attributes were displayed on the image. Once classified, the analysis results were converted back to map form as a cover type of information. Existing tabular information as represented by inventory is registered geographically to the map base through a vendor provided data management system. The notion of a geographical reference base (map) providing the framework to which imagery and tabular data bases are registered and where each of the three functions of imagery, maps and inventory can be accessed singly or in combination is the very essence of the forest resource information system design...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} the automated 2 D- 3 D image overlay system (“ 3 D Roadmap”) for use during endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in the hybrid operating theater. MethodsDatasets of preoperative CT images were modified to subtract dense bone marrow {{to improve the}} visualization of vasculature on the overlaid image, and allow for accurate navigation of the endovascular devices. The 3 D-CT <b>overlay</b> image was <b>registered</b> on the 2 D fluoroscopy image to mark the iliac crest and lumbar vertebrae on both images as landmarks. ResultsArteriography was performed only twice to confirm the precision {{of the position of}} renal artery and the final evaluation. Twenty patients underwent EVAR with Medtronic Endurant, Gore Excluder, or COOK Zenith using “ 3 D Roadmap”. The origin of the renal artery and iliac bifurcation were registered with complete accuracy in 10 patients (50 %). The lower renal artery deviated toward the cranial side less than 3  mm in six patients. In all cases, EVAR was successful, and completed with the volume of contrast material limited to 43. 8  ±  3. 1  mL. Conclusion“ 3 D Roadmap” was confirmed to be valuable for visualization of vessel origin in a fused image and for reduction of contrast material during EVAR...|$|R
40|$|A {{soil map}} of Santa Cruz Island (249 km 2) was {{constructed}} {{based on a}} field soil survey and data in a geographic information system (GIS) of the island. Soil map units were determined from 138 classified soil profiles generalized using a dasymetric approach based on an <b>overlay</b> of the <b>registered</b> GIS image planes of geologic substrate and vegetation. Nearly 60 % of the island is covered by the three largest mapped units, representing soils on volcanics and volcaniclastics under grass and oaks, and soils on the Monterey formation under grass. Eleven subgroups of the USDA Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff 1975) occur in the large area of island volcanics under grass (37 % of the island) and soil spatial variability is high, {{with two or three}} subgroups occurring in a single 2. 25 ha grid cell of the map. However, the southwest corner of the island has the most heterogeneous soils (14 subgroups) and the greatest soil spatial variability, with four or more subgroups occurring in a single grid cell. The use of a GIS permits rapid generalization of map units from sampled points, but the rales used for generalization were simplistic, based only on geologic substrate and vegetation, which in turn were mapped at a coarse spatial resolution (150 m). It is difficult to compare the accuracy of the technique to that of a standard soil survey, because no standard soil survey exists for the island. Soils not identified in map unit names are estimated to cover less than 25 % of the area of any map unit. However, the gridded format means that soil unit boundaries are poorly defined and therefore the map has limited field utility. Nevertheless this map provides a broad overview of the nature and distribution of Santa Cruz Island soils while illustrating a method whereby computerized data could be utilized in soil mapping...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{fundamental}} components of our daily lives is social interaction, ranging from simple activities, such as purchasing a donut in a bakery on the way to work, to complex ones, such as instructing a remote colleague how to repair a broken automobile. While we interact with others, various challenges may arise, such as miscommunication or physical interference. In a bakery, a clerk may misunderstand the donut at which a customer was pointing due to the uncertainty of their finger direction. In a repair task, a technician may remove the wrong bolt and accidentally hit another user while replacing broken parts due to unclear instructions and lack of attention while communicating with a remote advisor. This dissertation explores techniques for supporting multi-user 3 D interaction in augmented reality in a way that addresses these challenges. Augmented Reality (AR) refers to interactively <b>overlaying</b> geometrically <b>registered</b> virtual media on the real world. In particular, we address how an AR system can use overlaid graphics to assist users in referencing local objects accurately and remote objects efficiently, and prevent co-located users from physically interfering with each other. My thesis is that our techniques can provide more accurate referencing for co-located and efficient referencing for remote users and lessen interference among users. First, we present and evaluate an AR referencing technique for shared environments that is designed to improve the accuracy with which one user (the indicator) can point out a real physical object to another user (the recipient). Our technique is intended for use in otherwise unmodeled environments in which objects in the environment, and the hand of the indicator, are interactively observed by a depth camera, and both users wear tracked see-through displays. This technique allows the indicator to bring a copy of a portion of the physical environment closer and indicate a selection in the copy. At the same time, the recipient gets to see the indicator's live interaction represented virtually in another copy that is brought closer to the recipient, and is also shown the mapping between their copy and the actual portion of the physical environment. A formal user study confirms that our technique performs significantly more accurately than comparison techniques in situations in which the participating users have sufficiently different views of the scene. Second, we extend the idea of using a copy (virtual replica) of physical object to help a remote expert assist a local user in performing a task in the local user's environment. We develop an approach that uses Virtual Reality (VR) or AR for the remote expert, and AR for the local user. It allows the expert to create and manipulate virtual replicas of physical objects in the local environment to refer to parts of those physical objects and to indicate actions on them. The expert demonstrates actions in 3 D by manipulating virtual replicas, supported by constraints and annotations. We performed a user study of a 6 DOF alignment task, a key operation in many physical task domains. We compared our approach with another 3 D approach that also uses virtual replicas, in which the remote expert identifies corresponding pairs of points to align on a pair of objects, and a 2 D approach in which the expert uses a 2 D tablet-based drawing system similar to sketching systems developed for prior work by others on remote assistance. The study shows the 3 D demonstration approach to be faster than the others. Third, we present an interference avoidance technique (Redirected Motion) intended to lessen the chance of physical interference among users with tracked hand-held displays, while minimizing their awareness that the technique is being applied. This interaction technique warps virtual space by shifting the virtual location of a user's hand-held display. We conducted a formal user study to evaluate Redirected Motion against other approaches that either modify what a user sees or hears, or restrict the interaction capabilities users have. Our study was performed using a game we developed, in which two players moved their hand-held displays rapidly in the space around a shared gameboard. Our analysis showed that Redirected Motion effectively and imperceptibly kept players further apart physically than the other techniques. These interaction techniques were implemented using an extensible programming framework we developed for supporting a broad range of multi-user immersive AR applications. This framework, Goblin XNA, integrates a 3 D scene graph with support for 6 DOF tracking, rigid body physics simulation, networking, shaders, particle systems, and 2 D user interface primitives. In summary, we showed that our referencing approaches can enhance multi-user AR by improving accuracy for co-located users and increasing efficiency for remote users. In addition, we demonstrated that our interference-avoidance approach can lessen the chance of unwanted physical interference between co-located users, without their being aware of its use...|$|R
