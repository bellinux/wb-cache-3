5000|$|Cross-cultural {{assessment}} {{depends on}} the universality of personality traits, which is whether there are common traits among humans regardless of culture or other factors. If {{there is a common}} foundation of personality, then it can be studied on the basis of human traits rather than within certain cultures. This can be measured by comparing whether assessment tools are measuring similar constructs across countries or cultures. Two approaches to researching personality are looking at emic and etic traits. Emic traits are constructs unique to each culture, which are determined by local customs, thoughts, beliefs, and characteristics. Etic traits are considered universal constructs, which establish traits that are evident across cultures that represent a biological bases of human personality. If personality traits are unique to individual culture, then different traits should be apparent in different cultures. However, the idea that personality traits are universal across cultures is supported by establishing the Five Factor Model of personality across multiple translations of the NEO-PI-R, {{which is one of the}} most widely used personality measures. When administering the NEO-PI-R to 7,134 people across six languages, the results show a similar pattern of the same five underlying constructs that are found in the American factor structure. Similar results were found using the Big Five Inventory (BFI), as it was administered in 56 nations across 28 languages. The five factors continued to be supported both conceptually and statistically across major regions of the world, suggesting that these underlying factors are common across cultures. There are some differences across culture but they may be a consequence of using a lexical approach to study personality structures, as language has limitations in translation and different cultures have unique words to describe emotion or situations. For example, the term [...] "feeling blue" [...] is used to describe sadness in more Westernized cultures, but does not translate to other languages. Differences across cultures could be due to real cultural differences, but they could also be consequences of poor translations, biased sampling, or differences in response styles across cultures. [...] Examining personality questionnaires developed within a culture can also be useful evidence for the universality of traits across cultures, as the same underlying factors can still be found. Results from several European and Asian studies have found <b>overlapping</b> <b>dimensions</b> with the Five Factor Model as well as additional culture-unique dimensions. Finding similar factors across cultures provides support for the universality of personality trait structure, but more research is necessary to gain stronger support.|$|E

40|$|A recent {{resurgence}} in logical-rule theories of categorization has motivated {{the development of}} a class of models that predict not only choice probabilities but also categorization response times (RTs; Fifić, Little, & Nosofsky, 2010). The new models combine mental-architecture and random-walk approaches within an integrated framework and predict detailed RT-distribution data at the level of individual participants and individual stimuli. To date, however, tests of the models have been limited to validation tests in which participants were provided with explicit instructions to adopt particular processing strategies for implementing the rules. In the present research, we test conditions in which categories are learned via induction over training exemplars and in which participants are free to adopt whatever classification strategy they choose. In addition, we explore how variations in stimulus formats, involving either spatially separated or <b>overlapping</b> <b>dimensions,</b> influence processing modes in rule-based classification tasks. In conditions involving spatially separated dimensions, strong evidence is obtained for application of logical-rule strategies operating in a serial-self-terminating processing mode. In conditions involving spatially <b>overlapping</b> <b>dimensions,</b> preliminary evidence is obtained that a mixture of serial and parallel processing underlies the application of rule-based classification strategies. The logical-rule models fare considerably better than major extant alternative models in accounting for the categorization RTs...|$|E

Key findings are that catch-up occurs in four temporally <b>overlapping</b> <b>dimensions</b> in which, different macro-level governance mechanisms and firm-level orientations transform and affect the degree of catch-up.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Solid-state micropores {{have been}} widely {{employed}} for 6 decades to recognize and size flowing unlabeled cells. However, the resistive-pulse technique presents limitations when the cells to be differentiated have <b>overlapping</b> <b>dimension</b> ranges such as B and T lymphocytes. An alternative approach would be to specifically capture cells by solid-state micropores. Here, the inner wall of 15 -µm pores made in 10 µm-thick silicon membranes was covered with antibodies specific to cell surface proteins of B or T lymphocytes. The selective trapping of individual unlabeled cells in a bio-functionalized micropore makes them recognizable just using optical microscopy. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We locally deposited oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) and ODN-conjugated antibody probes on the inner wall of the micropores by forming thin films of polypyrrole-ODN copolymers using contactless electro-functionalization. The trapping capabilities of the bio-functionalized micropores were validated using optical microscopy and the resistive-pulse technique by selectively capturing polystyrene microbeads coated with complementary ODN. B or T lymphocytes from a mouse splenocyte suspension were specifically immobilized on micropore walls functionalized with complementary ODN-conjugated antibodies targeting cell surface proteins. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results showed that locally bio-functionalized micropores can isolate target cells from a suspension during their translocation throughout the pore, including among cells of similar dimensions in complex mixtures...|$|R

40|$|With {{the studies}} of the Stimulus-Response Compatibility (SRC), more and more psychologists {{consider}} that the compatibility isn&# 39;t only exist between stimulus and stimulus, response and response, but also any two sets in the information processing, {{it means that the}} compatibility is the basic feature of the human information processing. Research on the compatibility of the precue is a powerful evidence to support the issue. <b>Dimension</b> <b>Overlap</b> Model (Kornblum, 1990) {{is one of the most}} popular models to explain the mechanism of the SRC which focus on the <b>dimension</b> <b>overlapping</b> between the stimulus and response will activate the compatible response automatically, the compatibility effects origin from whether the compatible response prove or interference the response, the so the time course between the automatic activation and the task processing cause the dynamical time feature of the SRC (Kornblum, 1997). Yet the DO model has gotten many supports, it hasn&# 39;t been tested in the paradigm of the precue task. At the same time, company with the development of the Environment Psychology, the effect of the ex-information in the environment on the inside information processing has drown much attention, does the validity probability of the cue have any influence on the cue compatibility? How about the relationship of the cue compatibility and the SRC? Research on the questions will reveal the characteristics of the human information processing, enhance the knowledge of the compatibility phenomena and resource, enlarge the field of SRC and produce more practice usage on the design of human-machine system. The mechanism and influence factors of symbolic compatibility between cue and stimulus were investigated within a precueing paradigm. The influence of the <b>dimension</b> <b>overlapping</b> relation between the cue and the stimulus, cue and the response on the reaction time were studied under the different kinds of SRC, to test whether or not it confirms the <b>dimension</b> <b>overlap</b> hypothesis, to test is there any effect of SOA and validity probability of cues on the cue compatibility. The results showed that the cue compatibility exists and owns such features: 1, It confirms the <b>dimension</b> <b>overlap</b> model that the cue which <b>dimension</b> <b>overlapped</b> with the stimulus or the response will influence the efficiency of the processing, the reaction time is shorter when the cue is congruent with the stimulus or the response that that of the incongruent cue; 2, Consistent to the automatic activation hypothesis, the time course is the important characteristic of the cue compatibility. The largest compatibility effect can be gotten from the middle duration of SOA. 3, The validity probability of cues influence the cue compatibility significantly, the strength of the cue compatibility effect grows stronger with the higher validity probability of cues. 4, The cue compatibility affect the effect of SRC, especially when the cue is compatible with the stimulus; 5, The cue compatibility has two-fold meaning, the cue-stimulus compatibility and the cue-response compatibility, the former is stronger than the later when they compete each other. In summary, the compatibility, the basic feature of human information processing, is proved by the research, and the <b>dimension</b> <b>overlap</b> model and automatic activation hypothesis is tested by the studying on the cue compatibility. 随着对刺激-反应相容性原理的研究，越来越多的人认为相容性不仅存在于刺激和反应、刺激和刺激之间，还应该存在于信息加工过程的任两个阶段间，即相容性是人类信息加工过程的基本特征之一。对前置线索相容性效应的研究无疑是支持这个观点的有力证据。维度重合模型(Kornblum, 1990) 在解释相容性机制时，强调了集合间维度重合将自动激活相容反应的过程，相容反应对任务反应的促进或阻碍，产生了相容性效应；并由于自动激活过程与任务加工的时距带来了相容性的适时动态性(Kornblum, 1997) 。以上假设在解释刺激-反应相容性时，得到了广泛的支持，却没有应用于对线索相容性的研究。同时，随着环境心理学的兴起，外部信息对信息加工过程的影响引起了人们关注，线索的有效性能否影响相容性呢？此外，由于线索相容性的出现，与刺激-反应相容性的关系又如何呢？对这些问题的探讨，能够深入了解人类信息加工过程的特征，丰富对相容性现象和机制的研究结果，拓宽相容性研究的范围，并对人机系统的设计有一定实践意义。本研究运用前置线索技术，探讨了线索语义相容性的产生机制和影响因素。研究考察了不同刺激-反应相容性条件下，线索与刺激、线索与反应的维度关系对命名反应时的影响，是否符合的维度重合相容性效应的假设？线索与刺激的时间间隔(SOA) 和线索有效概率对线索相容性效应的影响。实验结果提示，线索相容性效应是存在的，并具有以下性质： 1 线索相容性的出现符合维度重合模型，与刺激、反应存在维度重合的线索影响了信息加工，其中与它们维度重合且一致的线索能促进加工过程，反应时较短，而与它们维度重合不一致的线索阻碍了加工过程，反应时较长； 2 线索相容性具有一定适时动态性，SOA是影响线索相容性的一个重要因素，支持了自动激活假设，较短或较长的SOA下，线索相容性效应较小，只有在中等SOA水平下，可以获得最大的线索相容性效应： 3 线索有效性影响了线索相容性，线索相容性效应随着线索有效性的增加而增强； 4 线索相容性影响了刺激-反应相容性，即使在无刺激－反应相容性时，线索-刺激的相容性极大地影响了信息加工过程； 5 作为线索相容性的两种类型，线索-刺激相容性和线索-反应相容性都存在，当两者发生冲突时，表现为线索－刺激相容性强于线索－反应相容性；通过本研究可以初步作出以下结论：存在着线索的语义相容性，进一步证实相容性是信息加工过程的基本特征；线索的语义相容性支持了维度重合模型和自动激活假设；线索有效性是线索语义相容性的一个影响因素；线索语义相容性影响了刺激-反应相容性，不同类型的线索相容性有一定强弱关系...|$|R
40|$|A new {{methodology}} {{has been}} developed that integrates the preliminary wing design with trailing edge high-lift systems and accounts for three-dimensional flap kinematics. The high-lift system in the developed application includes the kinematic synthesis of four common mechanisms (dropped-hinge, four-bar, link-track and hooked-track) and a preliminary actuation architecture. The paper details how each of these mechanisms is synthesized based {{on a set of}} intuitive input requirements such as gap and <b>overlap</b> <b>dimensions</b> in landing and take-off configuration. A SimMechanics multi-body mechanism model is generated to obtain the internal loads of the mechanism and actuation torque. The mechanisms and actuating drive train are structurally sized, leading to a determination of system weight and power consumption. A weight measurement of the outboard hooked-track mechanism of a VFW- 614 flap has been compared to a modeled hooked-track mechanism by using the proposed method. This resulted in a 13 % underestimation of the mechanism weight, which was attributed to modeling simplifications, sizing assumptions and a crude aerodynamic load estimation. A comparison study between the four different mechanism types to be applied on a Boeing 777 wing, shows that the method can give the designer valuable insight in the gap/overlap behavior of the flap during deployment as well as an initial estimation of the difference in required fairing size, mechanism weight, and actuation power between the four mechanisms.

The past two decades have witnessed a gradually changing paradigm in academic and policy debates regarding the questions of the normative basis of world order and possibilities for tackling imminent threats to security and peace (i. e. intra-state armed conflicts, failed states, terrorism, poverty, and deepening inequality). The introduction of concepts such as “human security” and “the right to humanitarian intervention/responsibility to protect (R 2 P) ” as well as critical examinations of peace-, nation-, and state-building missions (PNSB) {{have led to a}} relativist tendency of state sovereignty and a changing attitude regarding how to address the intersection of security, development, and human rights. Despite this shift, the policy commitments to integrating these policy considerations remain puzzling. How have they been redefined, conceptualized, and put into practice?

In addition, time constraints and other limitations mean that the role of good quality evidence is not as prominent as it should be and collaboration between different types of expert cannot be adequately developed.

Closely examining a video-recorded episode of girls telling on some boys highlights the practices that constitute cultural knowledge of children’s peer culture. This ethnomethodological study revealed a sequential pattern of telling with three distinct phases: 1) an announcement of telling after an antecedent event 2) going to the teacher to tell about the antecedent event and 3) post-telling events was observed. These findings demonstrate that telling is carefully orchestrated by children showing their competence to co-produce cultural knowledge.

The first is that China is an ancient urban civilization, but the processes we observe today are unprecedented.

The second thesis argues that urbanization {{is a set of}} multidimensional socio-spatial processes of at least seven different and <b>overlapping</b> <b>dimensions,</b> each with its own vocabulary and traditions of scholarship. The study of China's urbanization thus requires a trans-disciplinary approach. Thesis number three argues that urbanization involves rural-urban relations, but in contrast with many earlier studies, these relationships should be studied from an urban rather than rural perspective. Finally, and most contentiously, China's urbanization, although entwined with globalization processes, is to be understood chiefly as an endogenous process leading to a specifically Chinese form of modernity.

Driven to the brink of insanity by the shifts in reality the character has to solve puzzles and find answers in order to survive. Violence plays its part, but the terror is often on a pure psychological level.|$|R
40|$|Algebraic {{number theory}} relates SIC-POVMs in {{dimension}} $d> 3 $ {{to those in}} dimension $d(d- 2) $. We define a SIC in dimension $d(d- 2) $ to be aligned to a SIC in dimension $d$ {{if and only if}} the squares of the <b>overlap</b> phases in <b>dimension</b> $d$ appear as a subset of the <b>overlap</b> phases in <b>dimension</b> $d(d- 2) $ in a specified way. We give 19 (mostly numerical) examples of aligned SICs. We conjecture that given any SIC in dimension $d$ there exists an aligned SIC in dimension $d(d- 2) $. In all our examples the aligned SIC has lower dimensional equiangular tight frames embedded in it. If $d$ is odd so that a natural tensor product structure exists, we prove that the individual vectors in the aligned SIC have a very special entanglement structure, and the existence of the embedded tight frames follows as a theorem. If $d- 2 $ is an odd prime number we prove that a complete set of mutually unbiased bases can be obtained by reducing an aligned SIC to this dimension. Comment: 24 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
40|$|A fast {{routine for}} testing whether a {{triangle}} {{and a box}} are <b>overlapping</b> in three <b>dimensions</b> is presented. The test is derived using the separating axis theorem, whereafter the test is simplified and the code is optimized for speed. We show that this approach is 2. 3 vs. 3. 8 (PC vs. Sun) times faster than previous routines for this. It {{can be used for}} faster collision detection and faster voxelization in interactive ray tracers. The code is available online...|$|R
