Hemingway maintained permanent residences in Key West, Florida, (1930s) and Cuba (1940s and 1950s), and in 1959, he bought a house in Ketchum, Idaho, where he killed himself in mid-1961.|$|E

5|$|Todd {{purchases}} an SS uniform from {{a costume}} shop, and forces Dussander to wear it. When he {{spends more time}} with the old man, his grades suffer, he loses interest in his girlfriend, and he conceals his bad grades from his parents. In turn, the Nazi blackmails the young boy into studying to restore his grades, threatening to expose the boy's subterfuge and his dalliance with Nazism to his parents. Dussander even poses as Todd's grandfather and goes to an appointment with Todd's school counselor Edward French (David Schwimmer). Talking about the war crimes affects both the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> young boy, and an intoxicated Dussander attempts to kill a cat in his gas oven but fails when it attacks him and escapes. Dussander also takes great pride in Todd's unbelievable turnaround, going from near dropout to straight A's in a matter of weeks.|$|E

25|$|The answer {{assumes a}} third level on which The <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sea must be read—as {{a sort of}} allegorical {{commentary}} on all his previous work, by means of which it may be established that the religious overtones of The <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sea are not peculiar to that book among Hemingway's works, and that Hemingway has finally taken the decisive step in elevating {{what might be called}} his philosophy of Manhood {{to the level of a}} religion.|$|E

The sacristan fakes loyalty to the king, but during the battles he sends {{messages}} to the gaucho guerrillas hiding in the mountains by means of a messenger boy and by ringing of the bell. When the royalists discover this, they attack and burn the chapel and smash the sacristan's eyes. Blinded, the sacristan unwittingly guides the royalists to the patriot camp. The royalists then proceed to annihilate the gauchos. In the final sequence, after the battle, the only three surviving characters (the badly injured sacristan, an <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lieutenant who has fallen in love with Asunción and converted to the patriot cause) see Güemes' arriving troops, which will continue the battle.|$|E
500|$|In 1948, Hemingway and Mary {{traveled}} to Europe, staying in Venice for several months. While there, Hemingway {{fell in love}} with the then 19-year-old Adriana Ivancich. The platonic love affair inspired the novel Across the River and into the Trees, written in Cuba during a time of strife with Mary, and published in 1950 to negative reviews. The following year, furious at the critical reception of Across the River and Into the Trees, he wrote the draft of The <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sea in eight weeks, saying that it was [...] "the best I can write ever for all of my life". The <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sea became a book-of-the-month selection, made Hemingway an international celebrity, and won the Pulitzer Prize in May 1952, a month before he left for his second trip to Africa.|$|E

500|$|In 1958, Tracy {{appeared}} in The <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sea, {{a project that}} had been in development for five years. An adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's novella of the same name, Hemingway's agent, Leland Hayward, had previously written to the author: [...] "Of all Hollywood people, the one that comes the closest to me in quality, in personality and voice, in personal dignity and ability, is Spencer Tracy." [...] Tracy was delighted to be offered the role. He was told to lose some of his 210 pounds before filming began, but failed to do so. Hemingway thus reported that Tracy was a [...] "terrible liability to the picture", and had to be reassured that the star was being carefully photographed to disguise his weight. Appearing alone on screen {{for the majority of the}} film, Tracy considered The <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sea the toughest part he ever played. In reviewing the performance, Jack Moffitt of the Hollywood Reporter said it was [...] "so intimate and revealing of universal human experience that, to me, it almost transcended acting and became reality." [...] Tracy received Oscar and BAFTA Award nominations for the work.|$|E

Supplementing these were others with flattened blades that were neither hoes nor spades, but instead possessed the appearance of an unhappy attempt to combine the two implements in one.|$|R
