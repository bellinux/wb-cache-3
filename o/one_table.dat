5|$|A {{persistent}} thigh injury restricted Whalley's first-team involvement at {{the start}} of the following season, which also coincided with a change in management at the club, after a poor start to the season left Shrewsbury rooted to the bottom of the League <b>One</b> <b>table.</b> Whalley scored his first goal of the season against Oxford United, deep in injury time, to seal a 2–0 victory for new manager Paul Hurst in his first home league match in charge. After becoming a first-team regular under Hurst, and helping Shrewsbury avoid relegation once again in 2016–17, Whalley signed a two-year contract extension in May 2017.|$|E
5|$|After almost {{achieving}} a treble in the 1992–93 season, Al-Talaba were managed by Hussein Saeed {{in the first}} half of the 1993–94 season and Ayoub Odisho in the second; they finished in third place with 75 points. In the 1993 Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup, they came second in the Group <b>One</b> <b>table</b> behind Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya. In the semi-finals, Al-Talaba met Al-Zawra'a for the third time in a row and won 3–1. In the final, they faced Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya for the second time and defeated them 2–1 at the Al-Shaab Stadium, winning their second successive Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup under the management of Saeed. In the 1993–94 Iraq FA Cup, Al-Talaba again faced Al-Zawra'a in the final but lost by the same score as in the previous season, 2–1. In the 1994–95 Iraqi National League, Al-Talaba finished fourth with 105 points, two points behind Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya in second place and Najaf in third. In the last round, Al-Talaba faced Al-Zawra'a needing a win to finish second, but they lost 2–1. In the fourth edition of the Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup, Al-Talaba reached the final against Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya but lost 4–3 on penalties after a 0–0 draw.|$|E

The biblical text indicates that, when being carried, the table would be covered with a purplish-blue cloth, the loaves and vessels would be placed on the cloth, and another cloth, in scarlet, would be placed over it, with a fine skin being added on top of that.

25|$|Pardew {{was named}} the new manager of Southampton on 17 July 2009, after the new owner Markus Liebherr {{had taken over the}} club and sacked Mark Wotte a day after {{completing}} the deal to save the Saints. Pardew's first signing for the club was Dan Harding, who signed on a free transfer after being released by Ipswich Town. His first league match in charge was against Millwall on 8 August 2009, which ended in a 1–1 draw. He brought many new signings to the club, including League One strikers Rickie Lambert and Lee Barnard, the first of whom cost £1million. Pardew led his side up the League <b>One</b> <b>table,</b> and, despite their ten-point deduction, their challenge for a playoff place was kept alive until there were just two league games remaining.|$|E

The County Championship also moved towards its conclusion, with Nottinghamshire and Hampshire recording wins on the matches that started on 30 August to take the top two spots in the Division <b>One</b> <b>table.</b> In Division Two, Derbyshire came close to breaking their winless streak when they finished three runs short of a winning total against Durham, and {{had to settle for}} a draw; runners-up Lancashire lost further ground in the title battle through a 285-run defeat at the hands of Northamptonshire.|$|E
25|$|The {{appointment}} of Mark McGhee as player-manager, {{shortly after the}} takeover by John Madejski, in 1991 saw Reading move forward. They were crowned champions of the new Division Two in 1994. Thirty-five-year-old striker Jimmy Quinn {{was put in charge}} of the first team alongside midfielder Mick Gooding and guided Reading to runners-up in the final Division <b>One</b> <b>table</b> – only to be denied automatic promotion because of the streamlining of the Premier League, from 22 teams to 20. In 1995, Reading had eased past Tranmere Rovers in the play-off semi-finals and looked to have booked their place in the Premier League only to lose against Bolton Wanderers in the final. Quinn and Gooding's contracts were not renewed two years later after Reading had slid into the bottom half of Division One. Their successor, Terry Bullivant, lasted less than one season before being sacked in March 1998.|$|E
25|$|A massive batting {{effort from}} Warwickshire {{compounded}} with a remarkable second-innings bowling spell from Heath Streak and a spineless Gloucestershire effort in general, saw Warwickshire {{move to the}} top of the Division <b>One</b> <b>table.</b> It started all right enough for the hosts at Bristol, as a marathon three-hour fifty from James Pearson and 23 extras sent them to 254 on the first day. However, a partnership of 151 between Ian Bell and Jonathan Trott lifted Warwickshire into the ascendancy, as no Gloucestershire bowler found the required bite, and everyone of the top ten except Michael Powell went into double figures as Warwickshire amassed 473 in nearly 150 overs. Then, Streak stole the show. As Streak grabbed four wickets in the first hour, Gloucestershire were quickly 20 for 5, and despite a rescuing effort from Mark Alleyne and Ian Fisher, Gloucestershire were all out for 217 - two runs short of making Warwickshire bat again.|$|E

Under the new management team of Alec Stewart, appointed Director of Cricket, and Graham Ford, recruited before the 2014 season to be Head Coach, they won the Division Two title in 2015 and were also beaten finalists in the Royal London Cup. In January 2016 it was announced that Ford had left to rejoin Sri Lanka as head coach. Michael Di Venuto took over as Head Coach for the 2016 season and after a poor start, with Surrey bottom of Division One after seven games, the team had a strong finish to the season, finishing in the middle of the Championship and again runners-up in the Royal London Cup.|$|E
25|$|Wooden {{movable type}} {{had been used}} and experimented with by Bi Sheng in the 11th century, but it was {{discarded}} because wood was judged to be an unsuitable material to use. Wang improved the earlier experimented process by adding the methods of specific type cutting and finishing, making the type case and revolving table that made the process more efficient. In Wang's system, all the Chinese writing characters were organized by five different tones and according to rhyming, using a standard official book of Chinese rhymes. Two revolving tables were actually used in the process; <b>one</b> <b>table</b> that had official types {{from the book of}} rhymes, and the other which contained the most frequently used Chinese writing characters for quick selection. To make the entire process more efficient, each Chinese character was assigned a different number, so that when a number was called, that writing character would be selected. Rare and unusual characters that were not prescribed a number were simply crafted on the spot by wood-cutters when needed.|$|E
