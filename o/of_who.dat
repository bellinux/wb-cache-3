5|$|Renwick {{resisted}} the BBC's attempt to broadcast the episode at Christmas, feeling that such scheduling would contrast unfavourably with the grimness of the show, {{and would be}} viewed as an overt attempt to garner high ratings. The controller of BBC1 relented and the episode was first transmitted on BBC One on 20 November 2000. The broadcast coincided with the transmission <b>of</b> <b>Who</b> Wants to Be a Millionaire?s first UK jackpot win. Some people within the BBC alleged that Celador, the production company in charge <b>of</b> <b>Who</b> Wants to Be a Millionaire? had rigged Judith Keppel's victory to spoil the BBC's expected high ratings for the sitcom's finale. The Independent Television Commission (ITC) cleared Celador and ITV of any wrongdoing.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{a debate}} about whether a country should {{introduce}} financial planning to develop itself or rely on private entrepreneurs emerged. Nurkse believed that the subject <b>of</b> <b>who</b> should promote development does not concern economists. It is an administrative problem. The crucial idea was that {{a large amount of}} well dispersed investment should be made in the economy, so that the market size expands and leads to higher productivity levels, increasing returns to scale and eventually the development of the country in question. However, {{it should be noted that}} most economists who favoured the balanced growth hypothesis believed that only the state has the capacity to take on the kind of heavy investments the theory propagates. Further, the gestation period of such lumpy investments is usually long and private sector entrepreneurs do not normally undertake such high risks.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there were}} {{differences}} in season one, the current rules have applied in all subsequent seasons. One feature continued from season one {{was the way the}} show opened: viewers were shown the biggest and most intense physical altercation of the season, and the program then went back to a time before it happened. This fight usually gives you an idea <b>of</b> <b>who</b> {{is going to be the}} baddest, or one of the baddest, girls in the house. This altercation draws in many viewers and keeps them wondering what will happen next.|$|E
5|$|An infant with an anxious-avoidant {{pattern of}} {{attachment}} will avoid or ignore the caregiver—showing little emotion when the caregiver departs or returns. The infant will not explore very much regardless <b>of</b> <b>who</b> is there. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle {{in the early}} 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or {{turn away from the}} caregiver (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell theorized that the apparently unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants was in fact a mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart-rate of avoidant infants.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{question}} <b>of</b> <b>who</b> would represent the Earth as a whole, contact could create other international problems, {{such as the}} degree of involvement of governments foreign to the one whose radio astronomers received the signal. The United Nations discussed various issues of foreign relations immediately before {{the launch of the}} Voyager probes, which in 2012 left the Solar System carrying a golden record in case they are found by extraterrestrial intelligence. Among the issues discussed were what messages would best represent humanity, what format they should take, how to convey the cultural history of the Earth, and what international groups should be formed to study extraterrestrial intelligence in greater detail.|$|E

5|$|Assemblies and councils {{operated}} {{according to}} established procedures {{overseen by the}} augurs.

For elections, {{it was not a}} matter <b>of</b> <b>who</b> received the most votes, but rather who could first be approved by a majority of the voting blocs. All votes had to be completed within a single day and had to be done again if interrupted or abandoned.|$|E

5|$|Brezhnev's health worsened in {{the winter}} of 1981–82. In the meantime, the country was governed by Andrei Gromyko, Dmitriy Ustinov, Mikhail Suslov and Yuri Andropov while crucial Politburo {{decisions}} were made in his absence. While the Politburo was pondering the question <b>of</b> <b>who</b> would succeed, all signs indicated that the ailing leader was dying. The choice of the successor would have been influenced by Suslov, but he {{died at the age of}} 79 in January 1982. Andropov took Suslov's seat in the Central Committee Secretariat; by May, it became obvious that Andropov would try to make a bid for the office of the General Secretary. He, with the help of fellow KGB associates, started circulating rumours that political corruption had become worse during Brezhnev's tenure as leader, in an attempt to create an environment hostile to Brezhnev in the Politburo. Andropov's actions showed that he was not afraid of Brezhnev's wrath.|$|E

Carey also has played on the World Poker Tour in the Hollywood Home games for the Cleveland Public Library charity. In June 2007, Carey offered to donate up to $100,000 (in $10,000 increments) to the Mooch Myernick Memorial Fund if anybody could beat him at the video game FIFA Soccer 07 for the Xbox 360.

5|$|Carpentier {{reduces the}} {{individuality}} of the characters, enhancing {{the notion of}} humanity, keeping {{in line with the}} theme of history as a repetition of patterns regardless <b>of</b> <b>who</b> is in power. The simultaneous presence of fact and fiction and the cycle of reversal of fortunes presents characters as functional variants of each other. Through frequent use of metonymy, whereby a part replaces a whole, for example, referring to soldiers as uniformes (uniforms), Carpentier shifts the focus from individuals to the collective.|$|E
5|$|Christian baptismal {{theology}} {{prior to}} the Reformation taught that sacraments, including baptism, are means or instruments through which God communicates grace to people. The sacrament was considered valid regardless <b>of</b> <b>who</b> administered it. Not everyone who received a sacrament, however, received the grace signified by the sacrament. Some medieval theologians spoke of an obstacle of mortal sin which blocks the grace of the sacrament, while others insisted that the recipient be positively open and responding in faith to the sacrament {{in order to receive}} any benefit. Baptism was believed to be used by the Holy Spirit to transform the believer, and offered the benefits of remission of sins, regeneration, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. The sacrament of penance was believed to be necessary for forgiveness for sins committed after baptism.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{political}} sociology includes these areas of research, {{but it has}} been opened up to wider questions of power and politics. Today political sociologists are as likely to be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics <b>of</b> <b>who</b> knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions {{in such a way as}} to bring about widespread cultural and social change. Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of social movements and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.|$|E

5|$|Cross was a Liberal, {{and fast}} {{established}} himself {{was one of}} the party's leading Edmonton lights. By some assessments, he was the second most influential Liberal in the city after Frank Oliver, the owner of the Edmonton Bulletin and local Member of Parliament. Once {{the decision was made to}} create the province of Alberta, the question emerged <b>of</b> <b>who</b> would govern it: the Northwest Territories were governed on a non-partisan basis by Premier Frederick W. A. G. Haultain, who was a Conservative in federal politics. Some Liberals, such as Peter Talbot, were amenable to Haultain's becoming the first Premier of Alberta, either as the head of a non-partisan government or one formed by a coalition of Liberals and Conservatives. Cross was not among them.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{a decline}} in social {{mobility}} for those of less prominent clans, the local elites became far more integrated into a nationwide upper class social structure during the Eastern Han period, thus expanding the classification <b>of</b> <b>who</b> belonged to the upper class. The emerging gentry class—which became fully consolidated during the Eastern Han—consisted of unemployed scholars, teachers, students, and government officials. These men, although geographically separated and mired in local activities, started to view themselves as participants in wider national affairs of politics and scholarship. They recognized shared values of filial piety, deference, and emphasizing study in the Five Classics over holding public office. Emperors Yuan and Cheng were forced to abandon their resettlement schemes for officials and their families around the royal tombs settlement in 40 BCE and 15 BCE, respectively; unlike the days of Emperor Wu, historian Cho-Yun Hsu asserts {{that at this point}} officials and scholars had so much influence in both local and national-level politics that to forcibly relocate them became unthinkable.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker was the {{favourite}} {{throughout the}} leadership campaign. At the convention in Ottawa in December, {{he refused to}} abide by the custom of having a Quebecer be either the proposer or seconder of his candidacy, and instead selected an Easterner (from New Brunswick) and a Westerner to put his name in nomination. With most Quebec delegates backing his opponents, Diefenbaker felt that having a Quebecer as a nominator would not increase his support. Diefenbaker was elected on the first ballot, and a number of Quebec delegates walked out of the convention after his victory. Other Diefenbaker opponents, such as those who had urged Smith to run, believed that the 61-year-old Diefenbaker would be merely a caretaker, who would serve a few years and then step down in favour of a younger man, and that the upcoming election would be lost to the Liberals regardless <b>of</b> <b>who</b> led the Tories.|$|E
