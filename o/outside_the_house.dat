5|$|Harper {{denied any}} {{wrongdoing}} and subsequently filed a civil libel {{suit against the}} Liberal Party. Because libel laws {{do not apply to}} statements made in the House of Commons, the basis of the lawsuit was that statements made by Liberal party members <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> and in articles which appeared on the Liberal party web site made accusations that Harper had committed a criminal act.|$|E

In between cuts, they are shown in bed caressing each other. Johansson jumps into a pool <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> and floats below the surface as if she is drowning.

Charles leaves the house, intending to return to the United States, wondering whether Sarah is a manipulative, lying woman who exploited him.|$|E

5|$|Bamber's {{case was}} taken up by MPs George Galloway and Andrew Hunter and journalists Bob Woffinden and Eric Allison of The Guardian. Allison {{became one of the}} campaign's patrons. Woffinden argued between 2007 and 2011 that Sheila had shot her family, then watched as police {{gathered}} <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> before shooting herself. He changed his mind in 2011 and said he believed Bamber was guilty. In 2015 the human-rights campaigner Peter Tatchell appealed to the Chief Constable of Essex Police to disclose all evidence related to the case, in the interests of transparency.|$|E
5|$|Bamber's lawyers {{argued that}} images of Sheila {{taken by a}} police {{photographer}} at around 9am on 7 August 1985 showed her blood was still wet. According to the defence team, had she been killed before 3:30am, as the prosecution said, the blood would have congealed by 9am. They argue that she was alive when Bamber was standing <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> with the police, shot herself in the kitchen just as the police entered, then ran {{up one of the}} staircases to the bedroom, where she shot herself again, this time fatally.|$|E

His lifeless body is discovered lying on the ground <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> Though Scully concludes that Mr. Baiocchi died as the result of being pushed out of the window, Mulder discovers evidence suggesting he was pulled out by an outside force. Later, the agents learn that Lisa is another one of Karin Matthews' patients.|$|E

5|$|Driving past Silent Hill as a shortcut, Travis swerves {{his truck}} to avoid hitting a spirit manifestation of Alessa.

Losing consciousness <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> he awakens in the town and resolves to learn if she survived. During his journey, Travis unlocks his repressed childhood memories and defeats monstrous forms of his parents: {{his mother had been}} committed to a local mental institution after attempting to kill him, and his father had killed himself, unable to live with the guilt of having his wife condemned.

However, she explains that the tree house used to belong to her, and she promptly evicts them from their residence.|$|E
5|$|Griet (Scarlett Johansson) is a shy girl {{living in}} the Dutch Republic in 1665.

To help matters, Griet is sent {{to work as a}} maid in the household of famed painter Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth). Griet works hard, almost wordlessly, in the lowest position in a harsh hierarchy, doing her best despite spiteful treatment by one of Vermeer's children.

Chen's fellow activist Hu Jia stated that Chen had been {{planning}} escape for a long time, and had previously attempted to dig a tunnel for escape. In {{the weeks leading up}} to his escape, Chen gave his guards the impression that he was ill in bed, and stopped appearing <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> which allowed him several days before any absence would be discovered. Under cover of darkness and with the help of his wife, Chen climbed over the wall around his house, breaking his foot in the process.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenery and}} {{background}} of the story was meticulously copied from existing sources; car model types like the Opel Olympia 38 in which Calculus' abductors escaped the police were drawn from real examples, while Hergé closely adhered {{to the reality of}} the port and docks at Saint-Nazaire. Professor Tarragon's house was drawn from a real house in Avenue Delleur, Boitsfort, which Jacobs had identified for Hergé's purposes. Hergé and Jacobs stationed themselves <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and completed a sketch of the building. Immediately after, two grey cars containing German soldiers pulled up; the house had been requisitioned by the Schutzstaffel (SS). Hergé realised that, had he and Jacobs been discovered sketching, they would have been interrogated.|$|E

5|$|According to oral history, Rainilaiarivony {{was born}} on a {{day of the week}} {{traditionally}} viewed as inauspicious for births. Custom in much of Madagascar dictated that such unlucky children had to be subjected to a trial by ordeal, such as prolonged exposure to the elements, since it was believed the misfortune of their day of birth would ensure a short and cursed life for the child and its family. But rather than leave the child to die, Rainilaiarivony's father reportedly followed the advice of an ombiasy (astrologer) and instead amputated a joint from two fingers on his infant son's left hand to dispel the ill omen. The infant was nonetheless kept <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> to avert the possibility that evil might still befall the family if the child remained under their roof. Relatives took pity and adopted Rainilaiarivony to raise him within their own home. Meanwhile, Rainilaiarivony's older brother Rainivoninahitriniony enjoyed the double privilege of his status as elder son and freedom from a predestined evil fate. Rainiharo selected and groomed his elder son to follow in his footsteps as Commander-in-Chief and Prime Minister, while Rainilaiarivony was left to make his way in the world by his own merits.|$|E
5|$|As {{with each}} season since Big Brother 6, {{the program was}} filmed at CBS Studios in Studio City, California. The {{production}} team was located in the second story of the House which included the story department, audio department and the switchers and shaders.

The art department that created the competitions for the program was located <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>House.</b> The House theme was eco-friendly and modern California living was released on June 29 during media day, where select {{members of the press}} were invited to spend 12 hours inside the House. Official pictures of the House interior were released by CBS on the same day, showing the living room, bedrooms, kitchen, bathroom, lounge room and backyard. The living room featured chipboard walls with fake plants along the side.|$|E
5|$|Despite Sheila's erratic mental state, her {{psychiatrist}} {{told the}} court {{that the kind of}} violence necessary to commit the murders was not consistent with his view of her. In particular, {{he said he did not}} believe she would have killed her father or children, because her difficult relationship was confined to her mother. Her ex-husband said the same: that, despite her tendency to throw things and sometimes hit him, she had never harmed the children. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, testified that Sheila was not a violent person and that she had never known her to use a gun; June's niece, Ann Eaton, {{told the court}} that Sheila did not know how to use one. Bamber disputed this, telling police on the night of the shooting, as they stood <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> that he and Sheila had gone target shooting together. He acknowledged later that he had not seen her fire a gun as an adult.|$|E
