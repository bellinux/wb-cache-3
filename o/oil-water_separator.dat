40|$|We {{present a}} simple, {{environmentally}} friendly approach to fabricating superhydrophobic coatings with pH-induced wettability transition. The coatings are prepared from {{a mixture of}} silica nanoparticles and decanoic acid-modified TiO 2. When the coating is applied on cotton fabric, the fabric turns superhydrophobic in air but superoleophilic in neutral aqueous environment. It is permeable to oil fluids but impermeable to water. However, when the coated fabric is placed in basic aqueous solution or ammonia vapor, it turns hydrophilic but underwater superoleophobic, thus allowing water to penetrate through but blocking oil. Therefore, such a unique, selective water/oil permeation feature makes the treated fabric have capability to separate either oil or water from a water-oil mixture. It may be useful for development of smart <b>oil-water</b> <b>separators,</b> microfluidic valves, and lab-on-a-chip devices...|$|R

40|$|Compact <b>oil-water</b> <b>separators</b> are {{essential}} for treatment of the production streams of oil fields at deep waters. The aim of this work has been to develop {{a model for a}} compact oil-water separation system for optimization and control purposes. For these regards, the model is required to be relatively simple in order to achieve low computational costs. We have studied a system containing a gravity separator for the bulk separation of water and oil, and two inline swirl separators that are connected to it for further purification. One of the swirl separators is used to purify the water-rich product (oil-in-water emulsion) and the other one is used to purify the oil-rich product (water-in-oil emulsion). The separation system has been optimized for different inlet water cuts and flow rates. The optimization variables are the ratio between the product streams of each of the three separators. The models for the horizontal gravity separator and two co-current, in-line swirl separators have been developed and implemented in MATLAB. The models are based on a characteristic droplet size; the separation rate is given by the average terminal velocity, which is determined by the density difference of the dispersed and the continuous phase and the frictional force given by Stokes' law. The swirl separators use static swirl elements to generate swirling flows that facilitate separation. They are modeled with an inner forced vortex and an outer free vortex, which determine the centrifugal force on the dispersed droplets. The model for the swirl separator with oil-in-water emulsion in the inlet flow is compared to experimental data available in the literature and shows good agreement at different operational conditions...|$|R

Since this method of field development is not possible in a large city with no open land, all the wells tapping into the Beverly Hills field are clustered into four drilling islands—oil production and processing facilities tightly packed into windowless, soundproofed buildings—so as to have a minimal impact on adjacent land uses.

40|$|A {{novel and}} highly {{efficient}} <b>oil-water</b> <b>separator</b> {{equipped with a}} series of inclined multiple arc coalescence plates is developed and optimized for the removal of stable oil emulsions from produced water. The synthetic high salinity produced water with stable emulsions was prepared by mixing Catenex oil and the emulsifying surfactant (Armac T) with brine water. A series of experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of the arc coalescence plate geometry, produced water volumetric flow rate, influent oil concentration, and treatment temperature on the oil removal efficiency using the developed separator. Optimal coalescence plate arc geometry for maximum oil removal at different operating conditions was determined. Using the optimal coalescence plate arc geometry., strong correlations between oil removal efficiency from produced water, volumetric flow rate, and treatment temperature were established. The results demonstrated that the developed <b>oil-water</b> <b>separator</b> is highly effective in the treatment of stable emulsions in produced waters due to the combined effects of chemical demulsification and oil droplet coalescence.

40|$|The marine {{ecological}} environment and fishery resources can be severely polluted or destroyed by waste oil from fishing vessels {{if they are}} emitted directly into the ocean without any proper pre-treatment process. International conventions such as MARPOL 73 / 78 regulate waste-oil emissions and require the installation of a waste <b>oil-water</b> <b>separator</b> only for ocean-going ships of over 400 gross tons. Hence, these international conventions are not applicable to most fishing ships due to their low gross tonnages. In addition, space on most fishing vessels is too limited to allow waste-oil storage tanks or a waste <b>oil-water</b> <b>separator</b> to comply with international maritime regulations. Because {{a significant amount of}} waste oil is produced by fishing vessels around the world every day, effective strategies or measures are needed to prevent this waste oil from polluting the marine environment. This study thus investigates strategies and measures for improving the effectiveness of waste-oil collection from fishing vessels. This study found that existing procedures for the collection and treatment of waste lubricating oil on land could be applied to the management of waste oil and bilge water from fishing vessels. Sufficient oil-water separators and storage facilities for the collection of waste oil should be placed at each fishing port and shipyard. Fishermen should then be required to deliver their waste oil to these storage facilities, from where it can be transported to legal recycling companies for further treatment. In addition, fishing harbor authorities should bear definitive responsibility for monitoring the illegal dumping of waste oil and for checking the waste-oil record books of fishing vessels. Each maritime country should enforce relevant laws and regulations to reduce the emission of waste oil from fishing vessels into the ocean. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
