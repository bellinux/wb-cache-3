40|$|In {{this paper}} a general {{transfer}} matrix method (TMM) for rotors containing global and local coupler <b>offset</b> was derived.

The studies showed both global and local <b>offsets</b> played as an external excitation that is a combined effect of all the elements behind the <b>offset.</b> Differences between global <b>offset</b> and local <b>offset</b> were compared and the results showed both types basically retain the same mode patterns but different jumps at the <b>offset.</b> The global <b>offset,</b> yet, imposed more significant dynamic effects since all the <b>offsets</b> accumulate thereafter. The whirling orbits in front and behind the <b>offset</b> were illustrated as well. The results, as expected, showed global <b>offset</b> appeared much larger radii especially after <b>offset.</b> The rotor's whirling orientation reversed, as rotation fell within a certain range and this feature was not changed by <b>offsets.</b> The TMM proposed by this study can be well applied to multiple global and local <b>offsets...</b>|$|R

Clients (sovereign countries) have in place mechanisms to control their implementations, and to certificate milestone accomplishments in their <b>offset</b> programs. An <b>offset</b> supervision authority certifies the advancement in the <b>offset</b> completion in percentages, issuing <b>offset</b> certificates.

5|$|An {{individual}} {{currency devaluation}} has to involve a corresponding {{rise in value}} {{for at least one}} other currency. The corresponding rise will generally be spread across all other currencies and so unless the devaluing country has a huge economy and is substantially devaluing, the <b>offsetting</b> rise for any individual currency will tend to be small or even negligible. In normal times other countries are often content to accept a small rise in the value of their own currency or at worst be indifferent to it. However, if much of the world is suffering from a recession, from low growth or are pursuing strategies which depend on a favourable balance of payments, then nations can begin competing with each other to devalue. In such conditions, once a small number of countries begin intervening this can trigger corresponding interventions from others as they strive to prevent further deterioration in their export competitiveness.|$|E

Taking this latter point further, Plantinga argued that the moral value of human free will is a credible <b>offsetting</b> justification that God could have as a morally justified reason for permitting the existence of evil. Plantinga did not claim to have shown that the conclusion of the logical problem is wrong, nor did he assert that God's reason for allowing evil is, in fact, to preserve free will.

30|$|As {{a result}} of a time <b>offset,</b> a moving object edge will be {{spatially}} <b>offset.</b> Since the spatial <b>offsets</b> vary across tiles due to the synchronization mismatches, the edges of moving objects will suffer spatial <b>offsets</b> across the tiles. This is analogous to vernier acuity psychophysical experiments, where a line is presented with a break due to an orthogonal spatial <b>offset.</b> The distortions in our application are more general, where the <b>offset</b> break direction depends on the motion direction relative to the edge orientation. Further, in our application, the <b>offset</b> disappears with a nonmoving image, since the tiles are then essentially synchronized.

5|$|The Oddo–Harkins rule {{holds that}} {{elements}} with even atomic numbers {{are more common}} that those with odd atomic numbers, {{with the exception of}} hydrogen. This rule argues that elements with odd atomic numbers have one unpaired proton {{and are more likely to}} capture another, thus increasing their atomic number. In elements with even atomic numbers, protons are paired, with each member of the pair <b>offsetting</b> the spin of the other, enhancing stability. All the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers and they are not as common as the elements with even atomic numbers adjacent to them (the noble gases and the alkaline earth metals) in the Solar System. The heavier alkali metals are also less abundant than the lighter ones as the alkali metals from rubidium onward can only be synthesised in supernovae and not in stellar nucleosynthesis. Lithium is also much less abundant than sodium and potassium as it is poorly synthesised in both Big Bang nucleosynthesis and in stars: the Big Bang could only produce trace quantities of lithium, beryllium and boron due to the absence of a stable nucleus with 5 or 8 nucleons, and stellar nucleosynthesis could only pass this bottleneck by the triple-alpha process, fusing three helium nuclei to form carbon, and skipping over those three elements.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the He 111 A-L {{initially}} had a conventional stepped cockpit, {{with a pair of}} windscreen-like panels for the pilot and co-pilot. The He 111P and subsequent production variants were fitted with fully glazed cockpits and a laterally asymmetric nose, with the port side having the greater curvature for the pilot, <b>offsetting</b> the bombardier to starboard. The resulting stepless cockpit, which was a feature on a number of German bomber designs during the war years in varying shapes and formats, no longer had the separate windscreen panels for the pilot. Pilots had to look outside through the same bullet-like glazing that was used by the bombardier and navigator. The pilot was seated on the left and the navigator/bomb aimer on the right. The navigator went forward to the prone bomb-aiming position or could tilt his chair to one side, to move into the rear of the aircraft. There was no cockpit floor below the pilot's feet—the rudder pedals being on arms—giving very good visibility below. Sliding and removable panels were manufactured into the nose glazing to allow the pilot, navigator and or bomb aimer to exit the aircraft quickly, without a time-consuming retreat into the fuselage.|$|E
5|$|In May 1908, Archibald Leitch {{wrote to}} the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) – who had a rail depot {{adjacent}} to the proposed site for the football ground – {{in an attempt to}} persuade them to subsidise construction of the grandstand alongside the railway line. The subsidy would have come to the sum of £10,000, to be paid back at the rate of £2,000 per annum for five years or half of the gate receipts for the grandstand each year until the loan was repaid. However, despite guarantees for the loan coming from the club itself and two local breweries, both chaired by club chairman John Henry Davies, the Cheshire Lines Committee turned the proposal down. The CLC had planned to build a new station adjacent to the new stadium, with the promise of an anticipated £2,750 per annum in fares <b>offsetting</b> the £9,800 cost of building the station. The station – Trafford Park – was eventually built, but further down the line than originally planned. The CLC later constructed a modest station with one timber-built platform immediately adjacent to the stadium and this opened on 21 August 1935. It was initially named United Football Ground, but was renamed Old Trafford Football Ground in early 1936. It was served on match days only by a shuttle service of steam trains from Manchester Central railway station. It is currently known as Manchester United Football Ground.|$|E
