25|$|People {{who have}} ventromedial frontal cortex lesions {{were found to}} be more likely to reject unfair <b>offers.</b> <b>This</b> was {{suggested}} to be due to the abstractness and delay of the reward, rather than an increased emotional response to the unfairness of the offer.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, Berkeley {{initiated}} a revolutionary pilot program where homeowners {{are able to}} add the cost of solar panels to their property tax assessment, and pay for {{them out of their}} electricity cost savings. In 2009, more than a dozen states passed legislation allowing property tax financing. In all, 27 states offer loans for solar projects (though after the conclusion of the pilot program, due to issues with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Berkeley no longer <b>offers</b> <b>this</b> financing mechanism).|$|E
25|$|Drafted in {{the third}} round of the 1979 Major League Baseball Draft by the California Angels, Newman turned down their offer and {{returned}} to college. Again in 1980, Newman was drafted {{in the third}} round and declined contract <b>offers,</b> <b>this</b> time by the Texas Rangers. In the June secondary phase of the 1980 draft, he was selected in the 2nd round by the New York Mets. However, the Mets' offers were not enough so Newman chose to remain with his college team. A year later, on June 8, 1981, Newman was drafted in the first round (12th overall) by the Montreal Expos, with whom he would sign his first Major League Baseball contract.|$|E

25|$|Point-to-point sub-orbital spaceflight is a {{category}} of spaceflight in which a spacecraft uses a sub-orbital flight for transportation. This can provide a two-hour trip from London to Sydney, which would be much faster than what is currently over a twenty-hour flight. Today, no company <b>offers</b> <b>this</b> type of spaceflight for transportation. However, Virgin Galactic has plans for a spaceplane called SpaceShipThree, which could offer this service in the future. Suborbital spaceflight over an intercontinental distance requires a vehicle velocity that is only a little lower than the velocity required to reach low Earth orbit. If rockets are used, {{the size of the}} rocket relative to the payload is similar to an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM). Any intercontinental spaceflight has to surmount problems of heating during atmosphere re-entry that are nearly as large as those faced by orbital spaceflight.|$|E
25|$|The Singapore Sports School is for {{students}} who are perceived by the school to excel in sports it <b>offers.</b> <b>This</b> includes swimming, badminton, table tennis, soccer, golf, track and field, and sailing. It was opened in January 2004 and the school takes students directly into the school provided they have an active background in the sports offered by the school. When the school had its first intake, many students applied who were judged to excel in their sport but were posted to the Normal (Academic) or Normal (Technical) streams. The school rejected these pupils as the school sought pupils who excelled both physically and academically. The school was criticised for being too result wise instead of grooming them into future sportspeople. Some of the students were finally accepted on an appeal basis after that. Students in the school aim for the International Baccalaureate (IB) paper, similar to the Singapore Arts School.|$|E
25|$|Broadway District {{contains}} the major commercial thoroughfare of Broadway and houses the Broadway District commuter stop for NJ Transit's Bergen County Line train. Roughly located around the Warren Point and Lyncrest areas, the district also extends {{as far as}} Morlot Avenue along the tracks, roughly around or a little after Glen Rock Lumber, housing many industries on Banta Place. The Broadway District is mainly a shopping district as it contains many stores, eateries, hobby centers, salons, and other businesses. Not only is it the largest stretch of stores within Fair Lawn, it also houses {{one of the highest}} densities of nail and beauty salons in the United States. The Broadway District stretches from the Route 4 split with Route 208 and continues all through Fair Lawn and includes a few blocks of Elmwood Park before continuing to Downtown Paterson via the Broadway Bus Terminal. Broadway also hosts the route of local Paterson-New York Spanish Company mini buses, known locally as guaguas, as a cheaper alternative for commuters to and from New York. It is not only the sole district within the Borough that gives access to the guaguas but is {{one of only a handful}} of Bergen-Passaic-Hudson districts that even <b>offers</b> <b>this</b> service.|$|E

He should revere Prana (internal life force) because it is the yoni (womb, birthplace) of all fires. If he cannot obtain this fire, he should offer the oblation [...] "Om! I offer to all godheads, svaha" [...] with water as he begins the renunciation stage of life. As he <b>offers</b> <b>this</b> oblation, he should learn that the liberating mantra of Om is the three Vedas and the Brahman to be revered.|$|E
