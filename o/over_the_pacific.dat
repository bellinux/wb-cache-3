40|$|A {{regional}} model {{is used to}} study the radiative effect of boundary layer clouds <b>over</b> <b>the</b> southeast <b>Pacific</b> on large-scale atmosphere circulation during August–October 1999. With the standard settings, the model simulates reasonably well <b>the</b> large-scale circulation <b>over</b> <b>the</b> eastern <b>Pacific,</b> precipitation in <b>the</b> intertropi-cal convergence zone (ITCZ) north of the equator, and marine boundary layer stratocumulus clouds to the south. In a sensitivity experiment with the radiative effect of liquid clouds south of <b>the</b> equator <b>over</b> <b>the</b> eastern <b>Pacific</b> artificially removed, boundary layer clouds south of the equator almost disappear and precipitation in the ITCZ is reduced by 15 %– 20 %, indicating that <b>the</b> stratocumulus clouds <b>over</b> <b>the</b> southeast <b>Pacific</b> have both local and cross-equatorial effects. Examination {{of the differences between}} the control and sensitivity experiments indicates that clouds exert a net diabatic cooling in the inversion layer. In response to this cloud-induced cooling, an in situ anomalous high pressure system develops in the boundary layer and an anomalous shallow meridional circulation develops in <b>the</b> lower troposphere <b>over</b> <b>the</b> equatorial eastern <b>Pacific.</b> At <b>the</b> lower branch of this shallow circulation, anomalous boundary layer southerlies blow from the boundary layer high toward the northern ITCZ where the air ascends. An anomalous returning flow (northerly) just above the cloud layer closes the shallow circulation. This low-level anomalous shallow circulation enhances <b>the</b> subsidence <b>over</b> <b>the</b> southeast <b>Pacific</b> above <b>the</b> cloud layer, helping to maintain boundary layer clouds and temperature inversion there. Meanwhile, the strengthened cross-equatorial flow near the surface enhances moisture convergence and convection in the ITCZ north of the equator. This in turn strengthens the local, deep Hadley circulation and hence the large-scale subsidence and boundary layer clouds <b>over</b> <b>the</b> southeast <b>Pacific.</b> This positive feedback there-fore enhances the interhemispheric climate asymmetry <b>over</b> <b>the</b> tropical eastern <b>Pacific.</b> 1...|$|R

5|$|The Zeus missile began {{testing in}} 1959 at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) and early {{launches}} were generally successful. Longer range testing {{took place at}} Naval Air Station Point Mugu, firing out <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean. For full-scale tests, the Army built an entire Zeus base on Kwajalein Island in the Pacific, where it could be tested against ICBMs launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Test firings at Kwajalein began in June 1962; these were very successful, passing within hundreds of yards of the warheads, and even low-flying satellites.|$|E
5|$|The need to test Zeus against targets flying {{realistic}} ICBM profiles {{presented a}} problem. While White Sands was fine for testing the basic missile and guidance systems, {{it was too}} small to test Zeus at its maximum range. Such testing began at Point Mugu in California. where the Zeus missiles could fly out <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific.</b> Consideration was given to using Point Mugu to launch against ICBMs flying from Cape Canaveral, but range safety requirements placed limits on the potential tests. The Atlantic Test Range, to the northeast of Canaveral, had a high population density and little land available for building accurate downrange tracking stations, Ascension being the only suitable location.|$|E

The aircraft would ignite its rocket engine and adopt a trajectory that would take it over the Soviet Union at speeds of Mach 20 and {{at an altitude of}} over , before descending <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean to a landing at Groom Lake, Nevada, as a glider, landing on the lake bed using a skid landing gear.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Greg was {{the only}} eastern Pacific {{tropical}} cyclone in 1999 to make a direct landfall. Part of the annual hurricane season, Greg originated from a tropical wave that departed Africa in mid-August. The wave entered the eastern Pacific by September1, steadily organizing over subsequent days to become a tropical depression on September5. Amid a favorable environment, the cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Greg {{a few hours after}} formation and further organized into a Category 1 hurricane on September6. Greg paralleled the southwestern coastline of Mexico, where it destroyed over 250 homes, cut-off roads, killed 10 people, and left at least 4,000 more injured. The storm weakened to tropical storm intensity as it moved ashore Baja California Sur, although rain was generally beneficial there. Succumbing to cooler waters and high wind shear, Greg ultimately dissipated <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> on September9. Its remnants led to thunderstorms across northern California, with only minor impacts.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Liza was {{the third}} {{hurricane}} of the 1968 Pacific hurricane season. Forming from {{an area of the}} Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) on August 28 and reaching tropical storm strength in the same day, Liza meandered generally westward <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean, reaching hurricane strength on August 29 while far from land. It maintained that intensity until September 2, when the hurricane was downgraded to a tropical storm, but avoided tropical depression status despite the presentation seen by an Air Force reconnaissance plane. After weakening, the storm moved northwestward, weakening to a depression on September 4, when it began a turn to the east. There is a possibility that the depression completed a small loop between the downgrade and its dissipation on September 6.|$|E

5|$|Increasing {{wind shear}} {{accelerated}} {{the rate of}} weakening, causing Blanca's mid- and low-level circulation centers to decouple. By 18:00UTC on June7, the hurricane degraded to a tropical storm. Around 10:30UTC on June8, Blanca made landfall over Isla Santa Margarita {{off the coast of}} Baja California Sur before striking the mainland, near Puerto Argudin, at 11:15UTC. This marked the earliest known landfall in the state, and peninsula, on record during a calendar year. It surpassed the previous earliest—Tropical Storm Calvin on July8, 1993—by a month. Turning back to the northwest, the system briefly emerged back <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean before weakening to a tropical depression. Blanca made its third and final landfall near El Patrocinio around 20:30UTC. With deep convection no longer present, the depression degraded into a remnant low early on June9 over the central Baja California peninsula before dissipating hours later.|$|E
5|$|Launched in January 2001 after a {{short delay}} due to a problem with Mir, on 27 January Progress M1-5 became the last {{spacecraft}} to dock with the station. It spent two months attached to the Kvant-1 module before deorbiting the station on 23 March 2001. Mir re-entered the atmosphere with Progress M1-5 still docked, disintegrating <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean, with debris falling into the ocean at around 06:00 GMT. During {{the early stages of}} the unmanned Progress M1-5 mission, a manned Soyuz was placed on standby to launch in order to complete the mission if a problem occurred. The decision to deorbit Mir attracted both praise and criticism for Rosaviakosmos, while several campaigns to save the station were conducted.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald's Conservative {{government}} {{then fell}} from power <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Scandal, {{and was replaced}} by the Liberal administration of Alexander Mackenzie, who placed more credence on Morris's reports and had his own moral concerns about the whiskey trade. These worries were amplified by calls from Washington for Ottawa to secure the frontier and so prevent American Indians from purchasing whiskey in Canada. Mackenzie initially suggested sending a joint Canadian-United States military expedition, but, after the Governor General and others noted the serious implications of inviting the United States Army to deploy into Canadian territory, he instead agreed to deploy the new mounted police to carry out the operation. Another 150 men were recruited in eastern Canada and sent west by rail through the United States to rendezvous with {{the first part of the}} force at Fort Dufferin.|$|E

5|$|On November6, 2015, a {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the west coast}} of Africa into the Atlantic Ocean. Only sporadic convection—shower and thunderstorm activity—accompanied the system as it traveled west for the next ten days. As it reached the southwestern Caribbean Sea on November17, westerly winds associated with the Intertropical Convergence Zone spurred the development of an area of low pressure and extensive convection. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted potential for the system to develop into {{a tropical}} cyclone; however, persistent wind shear inhibited this system from consolidating before it reached Central America. The system emerged <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean near Nicaragua on November21; once back over water, convection blossomed near the low's center. Convection remained largely disorganized over the following two days as the system progressed westward in response to a subtropical ridge to the north.|$|E
5|$|The Puget Sound Convergence Zone is an {{important}} feature of Seattle's weather. In the convergence zone, air arriving from the north meets air flowing in from the south. Both streams of air originate <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean; airflow is split by the Olympic Mountains to Seattle's west, then reunited to the east. When the air currents meet, they are forced upward, resulting in convection. Thunderstorms caused by this activity are usually weak and can occur {{north and south of}} town, but Seattle itself rarely receives more than occasional thunder and small hail showers. The Hanukkah Eve Wind Storm in December 2006 is an exception that brought heavy rain and winds gusting up to , an event that was not caused by the Puget Sound Convergence Zone and was widespread across the Pacific Northwest.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Bavi, {{known in}} the Philippines as Tropical Storm Betty, {{influenced}} the trade winds <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean and was partially responsible {{for one of the}} strongest trade wind reversals ever observed. The system was first noted as a tropical disturbance during March 8, while it was located to the southeast of Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Over {{the next couple of days}} the system moved north-westwards through the Marshall Islands, before it was classified as a tropical depression during March 10. The system subsequently moved north-westwards and continued to develop further, before it was classified as the third tropical storm of the 2015 Pacific typhoon season and named Bavi by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) during March 11. After continuing its north-westwards movement, the system peaked as a tropical storm during March 14, before it started to weaken as it approached the Mariana Islands. The system subsequently passed over Guam during the next day, before continuing its west-northwestwards movement as it gradually weakened over the next few days. The system entered the Philippine area of responsibility, where it was named Betty by PAGASA during March 17 as the system weakened into a tropical depression. The system was subsequently last noted during March 21, as it dissipated over the Philippines.|$|E
