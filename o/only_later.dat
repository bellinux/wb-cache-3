5|$|According to the {{dominant}} scholarly view during the late 19th {{and much of the}} 20th century, Roman religion was originally animistic, directed towards spirits associated with specific objects or activities which were <b>only</b> <b>later</b> perceived as gods with independent personal existence. Terminus, with his lack of mythology and his close association with a physical object, seemed a clear example of a deity who had developed little from such a stage.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have been}} domesticated and bred as poultry {{for use as}} food {{for at least four}} {{thousand}} years. The most important species is the chicken. It appears to have been domesticated by 5000 BC in northeastern China, likely for cockfighting, and <b>only</b> <b>later</b> used for food. In ancient Egypt, poultry including ducks, geese, and pigeons were captured in nets and then bred in captivity.|$|E

5|$|In later years, {{through a}} study of many lunar {{orbiting}} satellites, scientists came to discover that most low lunar orbits (LLO) are unstable. PFS-2 had been placed, unknown to mission planners at the time, squarely {{into one of the}} most unstable of orbits, at 11 degrees orbital inclination, far from the four frozen lunar orbits discovered <b>only</b> <b>later</b> at 27°, 50°, 76°, and 86° inclination.|$|E
5|$|The Gates of Hell {{comprised}} 186 {{figures in}} its final form. Many of Rodin's best-known sculptures started as designs of figures for this composition, such as The Thinker, The Three Shades, and The Kiss, and were <b>only</b> <b>later</b> presented as separate and independent works. Other well-known works derived from The Gates are Ugolino, Fallen Caryatid Carrying her Stone, Fugit Amor, She Who Was Once the Helmet-Maker's Beautiful Wife, The Falling Man, and The Prodigal Son.|$|E
5|$|To promote ethnic harmony, in 1648 an {{imperial}} decree formulated by Dorgon allowed Han Chinese civilians to marry {{women from the}} Manchu Banners, {{with the permission of}} the Board of Revenue if they were registered daughters of officials or commoners, or the permission of their banner company captain if they were unregistered commoners. <b>Only</b> <b>later</b> in the dynasty were these policies allowing intermarriage rescinded.|$|E

5|$|According to {{linguistic}} sources, the Baltic tribes precursors appeared first inland, in {{the forest}} zone regions far from the sea, and <b>only</b> <b>later</b> settled the near Baltic Sea areas, extending from the northeastern part of the Vistula basin to the Daugava River basin. This westbound expansion resulted {{in the establishment of}} the two main Baltic branches: The Western Balts, represented by the extinct Old Prussians and Yotvingians, and the Eastern Balts including the modern nations of Lithuanians and Latvians.|$|E
5|$|After {{depositing}} {{his family}} in a London hotel, the Claimant called at Lady Tichborne's address and was told she was in Paris. He then went to Wapping in East London, where he enquired after a local family named Orton. Finding that they had left the area, he identified himself to a neighbour {{as a friend of}} Arthur Orton, who, he said, was now one of the wealthiest men in Australia. The significance of the Wapping visit would become apparent <b>only</b> <b>later.</b> On 29 December the Claimant visited Alresford and stayed at the Swan Hotel, where the landlord detected a resemblance to the Tichbornes. The Claimant confided that he was the missing Sir Roger but asked that this be kept secret. He also sought information concerning the Tichborne family.|$|E
5|$|Aqua's {{character}} has received mixed response from video game publications, with initial comments {{focused on her}} brief appearance in Kingdom Hearts II. Writing for GamesRadar, Chris Antista commented {{that he did not}} understand the importance of Aqua and the other characters being briefly featured in Kingdom Hearts II; <b>only</b> <b>later</b> was their importance explored at the end of Birth by Sleep. Prior to Aqua's appearance in Birth by Sleeps trailers, 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish stated that fans speculated the character would be male. Having played a demo from Birth by Sleep as Aqua in the E3 2010, Ryan Clements from IGN enjoyed her character due to her gameplay mechanics.|$|E

5|$|At {{the court}} in Ferrara, a {{collection}} of ladies skilled in music inspired the composer Luzzasco Luzzaschi and caught the Duke's interest. This group, {{which led to the}} formation of the concerto delle donne, performed within the context of the Duke's musica secreta, a regular series of chamber music concerts performed for an exclusive audience. This preliminary group was originally made up of talented but amateur members of the court: the sisters Lucrezia and Isabella Bendidio, Leonora Sanvitale, and Vittoria Bentivoglio. They were joined by bass Giulio Cesare Brancaccio, who was specifically brought to {{the court in}} 1577 for his singing ability. The preliminary ensemble was active throughout the 1570s, and its membership solidified in 1577. <b>Only</b> <b>later</b> did professionals replace these original singers.|$|E
5|$|Aurelian, {{learning}} about Zenobia's departure, sent a contingent which captured the queen {{before she could}} cross the Euphrates to Persia; Palmyra capitulated soon after news of Zenobia's captivity reached the city in August 272. Aurelian sent the queen and her son to Emesa for trial, followed by most of Palmyra's court elite (including Longinus). According to the Augustan History and Zosimus, Zenobia blamed her actions on her advisers; however, there are no contemporary sources describing the trial, <b>only</b> <b>later</b> hostile Roman ones. The queen's reported cowardice in defeat was probably Aurelian's propaganda; it benefited the emperor to paint Zenobia as selfish and traitorous, discouraging the Palmyrenes from hailing her as a hero. Although Aurelian had most of his prisoners executed, he spared the queen and her son to parade her in his planned triumph.|$|E
5|$|Curiously, {{the legend}} {{has not been}} {{reported}} by any Byzantine author. However, {{an investigation of the}} surviving holes wherein the metal letters were riveted verified its accuracy. It also showed that the first line stood on the western face of the arch, while the second on the eastern. According to the current view, this refers to the usurper Joannes (r. 423–425), while according to the supporters of the traditional view, it indicates the gate's construction as a free-standing triumphal arch in 388–391 to commemorate the defeat of the usurper Magnus Maximus (r. 385–388), and which was <b>only</b> <b>later</b> incorporated into the Theodosian Walls.|$|E

5|$|For ships, unlike aircraft, one {{deals with}} {{incompressible}} flows, where change in water density is negligible (a pressure rise close to 1000kPa {{leads to a}} change of only 2–3 kg/m3). This field of fluid dynamics is called hydrodynamics. A ship engineer designs for hydrodynamics first, and for strength <b>only</b> <b>later.</b> The boundary layer development, breakdown, and separation become critical because the high viscosity of water produces high shear stresses. Another consequence of high viscosity is the slip stream effect, in which the ship moves like a spear tearing through a sponge at high velocity.|$|E
5|$|In October 1932, Sargent {{suffered}} a near-fatal attack of tuberculosis. For {{almost two years}} {{he was unable to}} work, and it was <b>only</b> <b>later</b> in the 1930s that he returned to the concert scene. In 1936, he conducted his first opera at Covent Garden, Gustave Charpentier's Louise. He did not conduct opera there again until 1954, with Walton's Troilus and Cressida, although he did conduct the incidental music for a dramatisation of The Pilgrim's Progress given at the Royal Opera House in 1948.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s and 1980s Utopia became {{well known}} for the design and {{production}} of batiks. By 1981 there were 50artists at Utopia creating batik works; 88 artists participated in a major design project supported by the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association. Although several sources comment that artistic activity at Utopia began with batik and <b>only</b> <b>later</b> moved to painting, they do not state whether or not Minnie was a textile artist before she took up the brush. The National Gallery of Victoria's brief biography suggests {{that she did not}} participate in the making of batik, but she was aware of it.|$|E

5|$|Nielsen {{maintained}} {{the reputation of}} an outsider during his lifetime, both {{in his own country}} and internationally. It was <b>only</b> <b>later</b> that his works firmly entered the international repertoire, accelerating in popularity from the 1960s through Leonard Bernstein and others. In Denmark, Nielsen's reputation was sealed in 2006 when three of his compositions were listed by the Ministry of Culture amongst the twelve greatest pieces of Danish music. For many years, he appeared on the Danish hundred-kroner banknote. The Carl Nielsen Museum in Odense documents his life and that of his wife. Between 1994 and 2009 the Royal Danish Library, sponsored by the Danish government, completed the Carl Nielsen Edition, freely available online, containing background information and sheet music for all Nielsen's works, many of which had not been previously published.|$|E
5|$|No {{official}} canonization {{procedures have}} begun for Richard, though the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lafayette began collecting testimonials about reputed help obtained through her in 1991. Unlike the traditional support for canonization of a saint, which begins with popular devotion and is <b>only</b> <b>later</b> {{recognized by the}} Church, support for Richard began outside her immediate home area and was first promoted by the clergy, beginning with Brennan, Crowley, and Calais. The bishop of the Lafayette diocese {{at the time of}} her death, Maurice Schexnayder, visited her grave multiple times and referred to her as a saint. Another bishop of the diocese, Harry Flynn, presided at the thirtieth anniversary mass in 1989, along with sixteen other priests. The diocese also approved the creation of a private organization, the Friends of Charlene, to spread her story.|$|E

He was never found, however, and the Luftwaffe declared him missing in action, presumed dead, on 4 December 1940, earning him his last reference in the daily Wehrmachtbericht. Wick, on his 168th combat mission, was the first Oak Leaves recipient to lose his life in combat.|$|E
