[...] He went on to say, [...] "I just wanted to explore the conflicts between gays and Latinos and gays and blacks ... the real feelings [...] misapprehensions of each other.

500|$|Sabadino Parker from PopMatters wrote {{negatively}} {{about the}} mythology {{of the last two}} seasons, noting that [...] "story itself became even more convoluted" [...] and that [...] "the past two seasons should never have happened." [...] Entertainment Weekly reviewer Ken Tucker speculated that Chris Carter {{was the only one who}} seemed to understand the show's complex mytharc. Joyce Millman from The New York Times called the storyline involving Scully's child—which left her [...] "haunted and irritable"—"a sad misuse of the radiant Anderson". The A.V. Club was highly critical of the final season and its mythology story, calling them a [...] "clumsy mish-mash <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> had once worked and new serialized storylines about so-called 'super soldiers'".|$|E

500|$|The {{final game}} shipped {{with very little}} music, instead relying on the ambient sounds of the {{environment}} which was developed by Wabi Sabi Sound. Blow felt that the addition of music was a [...] "layer <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> works against the game". The ambient sound effects were made more difficult to include as the island the game takes place on lacks any other animal-based lifeform, making the player aware how alone they are while on the island. Most of the ambient sounds were recorded by Andrew Lackey of Wabi Sabi Sound, capturing them while walking around Angel Island in the San Francisco Bay. Lackey layered the various sound effects as to enable many different variations depending on the player's location on the island while also providing seamless transition from one environment to the next.|$|E

500|$|Soundgarden were {{pioneers of}} the grunge music genre, which mixed {{elements}} of punk rock and metal into a dirty, aggressive sound. [...] "Soundgarden are quite good..."

[...] Soundgarden's sound {{during the early years of}} the Seattle grunge scene has been described as consisting of [...] "gnarled neo-Zeppelinisms". The influence of Led Zeppelin was evident, with Q magazine noting that Soundgarden were [...] "in thrall to '70s rock, but contemptuous of the genre's overt sexism and machismo." [...] According to Sub Pop, the band had [...] "a hunky lead singer and fused Led Zeppelin and the Butthole Surfers". The Butthole Surfers' mix of punk, heavy metal and noise rock was a major influence on the early work of Soundgarden.|$|E
500|$|Bourque {{has been}} {{involved}} in many charitable endeavours both in Calgary and Lac La Biche. He says this lifestyle was tough growing up, which is why he started the Bourque Buddies charity to help Metis children have {{something to look forward to}} and work towards. “You see the effects <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> goes on in small towns or even in reserves and it’s a tough life for a lot of those kids,” Bourque says. He started the Rene Bourque Hockey Fund with the goal of providing hockey equipment to underprivileged kids, and has appeared as a spokesman for Native Americans in sport at youth symposiums. His fund led to the donation of 50 sets of equipment to underprivileged children in Northern Alberta during the 2008–09 season, and over 100 sets in 2010–11. [...] Also in 2010–11, he started a program called [...] "Bourque's Buddies" [...] that rewards kids from the Tsuu T'ina Nation who have made positive contributions in their schools with tickets to Flames games.|$|E
500|$|Kelly West of Cinema Blend {{was mixed}} towards the episode. While calling the new formula [...] "a {{breath of fresh}} air," [...] she was not entirely pleased with the final scene {{featuring}} Piz and Veronica's kiss, opining that the location {{and the fact that}} Veronica ran after Piz and kissed him back were not in keeping with Veronica's character. Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club was also critical of the case of the week and the episode in general. While admiring the show's decision to address the controversial issue of Islamophobia in the United States, he did not like the show's characterization of Rashad, the father, noting inconsistencies about whether his storyline was one of redemption or not. [...] "There are three seemingly equal interpretations: that Veronica Mars writers believe that the cartoon is worth ruining someone's life over; that Rashad is a complex character who can be petty and vindictive; or, it's just a bunch <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> happens and there is no moral." ...|$|E

500|$|The band {{took the}} {{approach}} of recording one song at a time, and agreed with O'Brien to mix the songs as each one was finished. O'Brien had the band members set up {{much as they do}} live, and most of the songs were developed out of jam sessions. Guitarist Stone Gossard said, [...] "I think we allowed things to develop in a more natural, band-oriented sort of way, rather than me bringing in a bunch <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> was already arranged." [...] Gossard added that most of the songs were arranged once Vedder joined in and started singing, elaborating, [...] "You could tell when the music wanted to change just by the way he was singing." [...] In a 2009 interview, Gossard stated, [...] " [...] was probably where it felt better recording wise. I saw how it could change and evolve which gave me a lot of inspiration to go we can do ballads, we can do fast stuff, we can do slow stuff, we can do punk stuff. That was where I realized there were gonna be a lot of places to go with Ed." ...|$|E
500|$|The ninth season {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews by critics and garnered negative reaction from many long-time fans and viewers. Sabadino Parker from PopMatters, called the show [...] "a pale {{reflection of the}} show it once was". Elizabeth Weinbloom from The New York Times concluded, [...] "shoddy writing notwithstanding, it was this halfhearted culmination {{of what was once}} a beautifully complicated friendship", between Mulder and Scully that ended remaining interest in what was a [...] "waning phenomenon". Another The New York Times review stated, [...] "The most imaginative show on television has finally reached the limits of its imagination." [...] The A.V. Club listed the ninth season and the 2008 film The X-Files: I Want to Believe as the [...] "bad apple" [...] of The X-Files franchise, describing the ninth season as [...] "clumsy mish-mash <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> had once worked and new serialized storylines about so-called 'super soldiers'". Brian Linder from IGN, on the other hand, was more positive to the ninth season, saying that the series could still have aired if the writers created a new storyline for Patrick and Gish's characters.|$|E
500|$|IGN Todd Gilchrist {{called it}} Bay's best film, and [...] "one {{of the few}} {{instances}} where it's OK to enjoy something for being smart and dumb at the same time, mostly because it's undeniably also {{a whole lot of}} fun". The Advertiser Sean Fewster found the visual effects so seamless that [...] "you may come to believe the studio somehow engineered artificial intelligence". The Denver Post Lisa Kennedy praised the depiction of the robots as having [...] "a believably rendered scale and intimacy", and ABC presenter Margaret Pomeranz was surprised [...] "that a complete newcomer to the Transformers phenomenon like myself became involved in the fate of these mega-machines". Ain't It Cool News's Drew McWeeny felt most of the cast grounded the story, and that [...] "it has a real sense of wonder, one of the things that's missing from so much of the big CGI lightshows released these days". Author Peter David found it ludicrous fun, and said that [...] " [...] manages to hold on to his audience's suspension of disbelief long enough for us to segue into some truly spectacular battle scenes". Roger Ebert gave the film a positive review, giving it 3 stars out of a possible 4, writing: [...] "It's goofy fun with a lot <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> blows up real good, and it has the grace not only to realize how preposterous it is, but to make that into an asset." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{season was}} {{produced}} by Bad Robot Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television. Though still set in Boston, the show's production for the second season moved from New York City to Vancouver out of financial necessity, as it lost access to New York's TV production tax incentive program. Fringe consequently got a mostly new writing staff and production team, though co-creators J.J. Abrams, Roberto Orci, and Alex Kurtzman, and producer Bryan Burk remained involved with the series. Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman returned as executive producers and showrunners. Jeff Vlaming and previous episode director Akiva Goldsman joined the crew as consulting producers. While Abrams had six episode writing credits for the first season he remained much more hands-off for the second, instead focusing on other commitments like the film Star Trek. He explained, [...] "Sometimes we'll talk every day. Then {{there will be a}} period of a couple weeks where we don't speak. But we're emailing a lot. There's a lot <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> happens that way." [...] Eden FX and Zoic Studios stayed as vendors for the series' visual effects, effectively giving Fringe a sense of continuity. Jay Worth, the overall visual effects supervisor, commented that having these two companies [...] "helped the show not feel as a big of a bump from one season to the next, particularly with different crews and a different vibe a little bit." [...] Despite his decreased involvement, Abrams was sent all of the visual effects for the series during production, and responded back with notes and tweaks.|$|E
500|$|The {{series has}} {{a score of}} 66 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on five reviews for season seven. In {{response}} to the season, Bianco from USA Today commented: [...] "Happily, it now seems to have landed on solid ground." [...] Also of the seventh season, Entertainment Weeklys Jennifer Armstrong said: [...] "It's in the shooting's emotional reverberations that the show is regenerating after the past few hit-and-miss seasons," [...] whereas Verne Gay of Newsday commented: [...] "Unfortunately, they've settled on far-too-easy and facile answers for the most part." [...] HitFix gave a positive review saying that, [...] "season 7 overall {{has been one of}} the show's strongest ever." [...] and added, [...] "There was a time when Grey's Anatomy was this show where I suffered through a lot <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> made me cringe to get to those genius melodrama moments it could do so well. Over the last couple of years, it's evolved into a show that's much more consistent in tone, where it may not move me as often as it did in the early years but also very rarely makes me question my reasons for watching." [...] Speaking of season eight, Entertainment Weekly Mandi Bierly called it a [...] "so-so season", and Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter called it [...] "emotional". Also acknowledging the fan base Verne Gay of Newsday wrote [...] "Grey's has had a good season and has an intensely loyal fan base to prove it." [...] regarding the 8th season.|$|E
500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "When I Grow Up" [...] {{is set in}} common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of E minor, with Scherzinger's vocal range spanning from low-note of E3 to the high-note of G5. Lyrically, the song is centered around {{the desire to be}} famous when one grows up. Using satirical and autobiographical lines, Scherzinger begins the song's first verse with: [...] "Now I've got a confession / When I was young I wanted attention". The [...] "repetitive and catchy chorus" [...] follows, where she sings the lines: [...] "When I grow up / I wanna be famous / I wanna be a star / I wanna be in movies". MTV News commented that the song contains a theme that is [...] "getting plenty of traction these days – beware the high cost of fame." [...] Meanwhile, group member Melody Thornton said of the song's concept: [...] "If you strive for higher and bigger things – along with that – comes hard work and dealing with a lot <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> you'd never assume you'd have to. So yeah, while the song is meant to be playful, it still does have that little warning twist to it". Bill Lamb from About.com named [...] "When I Grow Up" [...] a possible answer song to Pink's [...] "Stupid Girls" [...] (2006). Music critics were initially confused by the line [...] "I wanna have groupies" [...] in the chorus; mistaking the line as saying [...] "I wanna have boobies". American comedian Ellen DeGeneres also pointed this out when they performed the song on her talk show on September 23, 2008. Nicole Scherzinger said that [...] "All of us started with a dream...I know when I was young, and I would sign people's notebooks, I wrote, 'Remember me when I'm famous,' and I don't know of a little kid who hasn't aspired to be someone" ...|$|E
