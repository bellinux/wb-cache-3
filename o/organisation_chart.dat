40|$|It is now well-established, {{that there}} are three {{important}} aspects of business processes: the behaviour aspect, the information aspect, and the organisation aspect. Dependent on the application area and the purpose of the models, there are even more aspects that need to be considered. Conceptually, most of the aspects of business processes are completely independent of each other. In fact, modelling these different aspects requires quite different formalism such as Petri nets, Entity-Relationship diagrams, or <b>organisation</b> <b>charts.</b> And, in principle, it should be easy to replace a modelling formalism for one aspect by another formalism for that aspect without effecting the models and formalisms used for the other aspects. In practise, however, formalisms for modelling business processes integrate all aspects, which spoils the conceptual independence of the different aspects, and, even worse, puts the focus on one aspect and neglecting others. In this paper, we present an ontology of business process modelling that captures this independence of the different aspects and that is independent of a particular modelling formalism. This way, this ontology captures the essence of the different aspects of business process modelling. This ontology is formalised by UML class diagrams showing the different concepts and their relations. Besides a nice graphical illustration of the ontology, the use of UML provides a technical basis for defining interfaces that must be met by concrete formalisms in order to implement a particular aspect. This way, the UML formalisation of the ontology is a first step towards a formalism independent workflow architecture. The focus of this paper, however, is on the concepts and the ontology, which is not biased towards a particular formalism and reflects the independence of the models for the different aspects...|$|R

40|$|From {{time to time}} {{developers}} of (database) applications will encounter, explicitly or implicitly, structures such as trees, graphs, and networks. Such applications can for instance relate to bills of material, <b>organisation</b> <b>charts,</b> networks of (rail) roads, networks of conduit pipes, telecom -networks, and data dictionaries. Algorithms on such data structures often ask for recursion or iteration of which the number of repetitions is unknown beforehand. Such algorithms are usually programmed in a third generation language (3 GL) and are therefore typically "record-at- a-time". Extensions of SQL with procedures and "control of flow" constructions such as if-then-else and while {{make it possible to}} solve such graph problems completely (and compactly) on 4 GL-level. Actually, such SQL-extensions already exist for some time in several commercially available database management systems. In this paper we will work out the idea of graph algorithms on 4 GL-level starting with the "standard" recursive graph problem of the computation of the set of all paths in a graph. It will also be shown that the computation of the paths themselves can easily be extended with the computation of additional path properties. Such algorithms operate essentially different from the algorithms on 3 GL-level. One of the advantages of our approach is that it makes the development of ad hoc queries in such (recursive) application areas considerably easier (i. e., both simpler and faster), which in turn facilitates the development of the MIS-part of information systems in those application areas. Even on 4 GL-level we are able to influence the efficiency of our graph algorithms. We will therefore present some improvements on our algorithms, all leading to successively better results. It turns out that our intuition regarding the correctness (and the termination) of these (subtle) "set-at-a-time" algorithms sometimes lags behind. Therefore we also pay special attention to the correctness and termination of the algorithms (using invariants). All programs turn out to be rather compact: they consist of only a few SQL-statements. This clearly contributes to the transparency {{of the structure of the}} algorithm and the maintainability of the software. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{grew from}} two frustrations. The {{first was the}} personal frustration experienced when attempting to find information on websites; especially government websites. Often the sites were loaded down {{with all sorts of}} information such as corporate <b>organisation</b> <b>charts</b> and press releases but lacked the information which would allow clients to interact effectively with the agency or meet their information needs and move on. The second frustration was that of Edith Cowan University students who battled with a diverse, overlapping and incomplete set of both online and paper based resources as they sought to make decisions about their selections of supporting studies. Both frustrations arose from a lack of user centeredness in the design and construction of the information services provided. A solution would be to establish an effective and efficient method to find out what information users of online information services really needed in order to solve the problems which brought them to the sites in the first place. The sense-making metatheoretic approach of Brenda Dervin with its accompanying timeline interview methodology suggested itself as an in-depth way to elicit the information needs of potential users of online information services. However, timeline interview protocols require long, complex and highly structured interviews. This study, as a result, developed as a critical review of sense-making {{in the context of the}} timeline interview by comparing the insights into information needs obtained from timeline interviews with those of three, more widely used, information gathering methods; survey, semi-structured interview and focus group. Students, mainly from the Edith Cowan University Schools of Communication and Multimedia and Computer and Information Science, were asked about their information needs in relation to choosing supporting studies as required by their course structures. All data collection methods were analysed using the same qualitative content analysis techniques. The outcome showed a high degree of consistency between the information needs elicited by all four data collection methods. In addition, the timeline interviews did not identify any major information needs not found by the alternative methods. Another notable finding was that respondents to all four data collection methods expressed a strong preference for speaking to a real live person as a way of meeting their information needs. This goes against conventional view of the technology preferences of younger people. The time and resources required to carry out and analyse the timeline interviews were also much greater than for any of the other data collection methods. The implications for the designers of online information services are that many people are perfectly capable of explicating their information needs regardless of the way in which those needs are elicited. That being the case, the cheapest and quickest method chosen is likely to provide useful insight into information needs. A final implication is that online services which provide links to real people via technologies such as social networking, voice or video contact are the most likely to give users a feeling of assurance about the information they obtai...|$|R

40|$|Aim of abstract/paper - {{research}} question Over the last 30 years, {{the activities of}} international sport federations (ISF) have changed drastically from simply being the governing body, making and supervises international rules, to being a global actor at multiple levels, including the organisation of major events, commercialization of rights and development of and through their sport. By evolving from mainly administrative and volunteer-run organisations to more professionalized structures with an increased business focus, different forms of professionalization have emerged. To distinguish these forms, researchers need to analyse the federation’s internal situation (e. g. professionalization of individuals, structures and procedures, activities) as well as external factors (e. g. political factors such as regulatory requirements, economic {{factors such as the}} national economy, social factors such as image of the organisation and technology factors such as information and communication). This paper tries to elucidate the different forms of professionalization, and the respective consequences that these forms may entail, especially with regard to governance and strategic management. Theoretical background/literature review Though previous research has focused on organisational change in national federations and clubs, the professionalization of ISF has received very little attention. Organisational change, new institutionalism and strategic choice theory appear to be appropriate theoretical approaches to remedy this lack. Organisational change encompasses increasing rationalization of structures and procedures due to the gradual replacement of volunteers by professionals (Thibault, Slack, & Hinings, 1991), and the role of individual key actors as accelerators or decelerators of change in sport federations. The new institutionalism perspective allows us to look at the federations’ organisational context, which, in the course of business-orientation and commercialization, {{is becoming more and more}} influenced by political, economic and regulatory aspects, inevitably impacting on their decisions and actions (Greenwood & Hinings, 1996). In this field of constantly changing interactions and interdependencies, federations try to achieve stability by creating strategic alliances. The strategic choice theory will therefore be applied, implying dynamic processes at the external level as much as choices of individual key actors or groups (Miles, Snow, Meyer, & Coleman, 1978). Methodology, research design and data analysis The conceptual framework of Nagel et al. (Nagel, Schlesinger, Bayle, & Giauque, 2015) on causes, forms and consequences of professionalization of sport federations was employed. Focussing on the period 1990 - 2015, forms were examined by looking at three dimensions: activities (diversification, strategic planning), individuals (profiles of paid staff) and structures and processes (formalization, specialization). The analysis of consequences focussed on governance changes and aspects of leadership at the sport federation level, their impact on member federations and expectations of and relationships with external stakeholders. A two-tier approach was chosen: an exploratory study, nine case studies. Data collection started in September 2014 and comprises multiple sources of evidence. To gather in-depth information from within seven international sport federations, semi-structured interviews (n= 25) with staff members from different hierarchical levels and functions were conducted. Information from interviews was triangulated with federations’ internal documents (annual reports, <b>organisation</b> <b>charts,</b> statutes), external documents (IOC evaluation criteria, Agenda 2020), and relevant literature. Results, discussion and implications/conclusions Our analysis of forms and consequences of professionalization allowed us to distinguish specific adaptation configurations. These show strong resemblance with the typology of Miles and Snow (1978). Furthermore, an increasingly politicized environment induces new challenges. In this context, the role of individual key actors and their leadership styles (Bayle, 2001), as well as political stability play a crucial role in ISF strategic management, influencing notably the intensity and speed of organisational changes. Based on leaders’ ability to manage increasingly intricate political, economic and social aspects, ISF professionalize at different speeds...|$|R

40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 583 on 27. 02. 2017 by CS (TIS) Radical advances in microelectronics applications during the 1970 's precipitated rapid developments in new office technology {{which was held}} to threaten {{the very existence of}} the traditional secretarial task role. Many contemporary commentators conceived a correlative link between the emergence of the new technology and the displacement of administrative support staff, whilst others predicted that a form of "Taylorism" was about to invade the office environment with all manner of dehumanising connotations. The reality proved somewhat different and, far from eradicating the role of the secretary or reducing it to assembly-line proportions, the technology helped to facilitate the flattening of organisational structures, thereby exposing secretaries to new opportunities as they asserted control over the new communications. Companies subsequently perceived the benefits of horizontally enlarging secretarial roles to encompass paraprofessional activities such as personnel, finance, sales and marketing, etc., or vertically extending them to undertake supervisory or monitorial tasks that were previously the domain of functional managers. Thus, the training and development of secretarial and administrative support staff became of paramount importance, yet this was frequently left to the vagaries of chance, to the whim of management, or to questionable analytical practices. The following thesis discusses the role of the secretary in its inner and outer context and explores the literature to ascertain weaknesses in contemporary approaches to needs analysis. Moreover, from a survey of Times Top 1, 000 Companies, it examines the forces for change that are influencing these <b>organisations</b> and <b>charts</b> the ways that secretarial and administrative support staff are increasingly addressing performance gaps in corporate indices of effectiveness. Equally, in combining a survey of secretaries, it establishes the range of competencies that are considered important in reconciling individual, task and organisational goals and suggests a diagnostic procedure that might effectively accomplish this without the biases and concerns that have resolutely pervaded needs analysis methodologies...|$|R
