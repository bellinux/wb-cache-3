5|$|A trough {{extended}} from the northern Gulf of Mexico to the western Atlantic Ocean in early August. The trough remained nearly stationary, spawning Tropical Storm Bertha in the Gulf of Mexico and a tropical disturbance {{off the coast of}} South Carolina. The weak low pressure area off South Carolina drifted southward, with its associated deep convection increasing in organization on August 4.

The storm also dropped light rainfall of up to 1.75inches (44mm), and resulted in a storm tide of 5.7feet (1.7m) above the mean low water level.|$|E
