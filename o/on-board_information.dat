40|$|Abstract—The {{vehicle fleet}} of public {{transportation}} companies is often equipped with intelligent <b>on-board</b> passenger <b>information</b> systems. A frequently used but time and labor-intensive way for keeping the on-board controllers up-to-date is the manual update using different memory cards (e. g. flash cards) or portable computers. This paper describes a compression algorithm that enables data transmission using low bandwidth wireless radio networks (e. g. GPRS) by minimizing the amount of data traffic. In typical cases it reaches a compression rate of {{an order of magnitude}} better than that of the general purpose compressors. Compressed data can be easily expanded by the low-performance controllers, too. Keywords—Data analysis, data compression, differential encoding, run-length encoding, vehicle control. T I...|$|R

40|$|A {{new path}} {{planning}} method for Mobile Robots (MR) {{has been developed}} and implemented. On the one hand, based on the shortest path from the start point to the goal point, this path planner can choose the best moving directions of the MR, which helps to reach the target point as soon as possible. On the other hand, with an intelligent obstacle avoidance, our method can find the target point with the near-shortest path length while avoiding some infinite loop traps of several obstacles in unknown environments. The combination of two approaches helps the MR to reach the target point with a very reliable algorithm. Moreover, by continuous updates of the <b>on-board</b> sensors <b>information,</b> this approach can generate the MRs trajectory both in static and dynamic environments.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the functional requirement for an In-Vehicle Information System (IVIS), which will manage and display all driving-related information from many sources. There are numerous information systems currently being fielded or developed (e. g., routing and navigation, collision avoidance). However, without a logical integration {{of all of}} the possible <b>on-board</b> <b>information,</b> there is a potential for overwhelming the driver. The system described in this paper will filter and prioritize information across all sources, and present it to the driver in a timely manner, within a unified interface. To do this, IVIS will perform three general functions: (1) interact with other, <b>on-board</b> <b>information</b> subsystems and the vehicle; (2) manage the information by filtering, prioritizing, and integrating it; and (3) interact with the driver, both in terms of displaying information to the driver and allowing the driver to input requests, goals and preferences. The functional requirements described in this paper have either been derived from these three high-level functions or are directly mandated by the overriding requirements for modularity and flexibility. IVIS will {{have to be able to}} accommodate different types of information subsystems, of varying level of sophistication. The system will also have to meet the diverse needs of different types of drivers (private, commercial, transit), who may have very different levels of expertise in using information systems...|$|E

Micro/Nano Air vehicles (MAV/NAVs) are rapidly developing to become an integral component of a soldier’s real-time information and intelligence gathering capability on enemy strength, dispositions and tactics.
