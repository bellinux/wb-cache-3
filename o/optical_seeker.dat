50|$|There {{are three}} main {{variants}} in use: the Stinger basic, STINGER-Passive <b>Optical</b> <b>Seeker</b> Technique (POST), and STINGER-Reprogrammable Microprocessor (RMP). These {{correspond to the}} FIM-92A, FIM-92B, and FIM-92C and later variants respectively.|$|E
50|$|The Verbas primary {{new feature}} is its {{multispectral}} <b>optical</b> <b>seeker,</b> using three sensors - ultraviolet, near infrared, and mid-infrared - {{as opposed to}} the Igla-S two. Cross-checking sensors against one another better discriminates between relevant targets and decoys, and decreases the chance of disruption from countermeasures, including lasers that attempt to blind missiles.|$|E
40|$|Hypersonic endo-atmospheric interceptors must {{maneuver}} over {{a variety}} of flight environ-ments. Generally, these interceptor missions require flight below Mach 8 for some portion of the mission. Hypervelocity intercepts can occur at high altitudes but are more stressing at the lower alti-tude, high Reynolds number conditions. To obtain the high accuracy needed for hit-to-kill, endo-atmospheric interceptors use optically based <b>seeker</b> systems. These <b>optical</b> <b>seekers</b> rely on precise knowledge of the interceptor position to select an aimpoint. Optical aberrations caused by hypersonic flight can distort or shift the image posi-tion on the focal plane enough to add uncertainty i...|$|R
50|$|<b>Optical</b> {{contrast}} <b>seekers,</b> {{or simply}} contrast seekers, are {{a type of}} missile guidance system using a television camera as its primary input. The camera is initially pointed at a target and then locked on, allowing the missile to fly to its target by keeping the image stable within the camera's field of view.|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} aspect of theater missile defense is the multiband spectral characterization of plume radiation during the boost phase of a missile. Current Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) plans call for study of the utility of a dual-mode ultraviolet (UV) and mid-wave infrared (MWIR) seeker. Combining the conventional MWIR sensor with shorter wavelengths provides increased information content for the image and can aid in optical target characterization. However, even dual-mode seekers have potential problems. Onboard <b>optical</b> <b>seekers</b> are subject to some vehicle self-interference. Sources of optical interference include outgassing of vehicle contaminants, and by-products of the vehicle plume and attitude control systems, especially if solid aluminized propellants are used. Carbon particles are commonly present in the exhaust plume of kerosene liquid-oxygen (LOX) motors used by Atlas-type rockets. Once formed, carbon may contribute a continuum-like feature to the optical radiation of a rocket exhaust plume, especially in the near-UV [1]. ...|$|R
50|$|Since 2014 the Igla {{is being}} {{replaced}} in Russian service {{by the new}} 9K333 Verba (Willow) MANPADS. The Verba's primary feature is its multispectral <b>optical</b> <b>seeker,</b> using three sensors {{as opposed to the}} Igla-S' two. Cross-checking sensors against one another better discriminates between relevant targets and decoys, and decreases the chance of disruption from countermeasures, including lasers that attempt to blind missiles.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of the change in role and more relaxed weight limits of a vehicle-mounted SAM, the design team made the 9M31 a much heavier missile, which {{permitted}} fewer design compromises than in the case of Strela-2 to achieve acceptable kinematic performance. The most notable difference is the much larger diameter of the missile and a blunt seeker head that occupies the full width of the missile body. With all else being equal, the ability of an <b>optical</b> <b>seeker</b> to detect a target is directly proportional to its diameter, {{but on the other hand}} aerodynamic drag increases proportionally to the square of the diameter.|$|E
50|$|To date, the U.S. {{military}} has fielded four variants of the Stinger missile system: the basic Stinger, Stinger-POST, Stinger-RMP, and the Stinger-RMP Block I. In addition, the Army planned to field the Stinger-RMP Block II, but cancelled {{the program in}} 2000 due fiscal constraints.The Stinger-Passive <b>Optical</b> <b>Seeker</b> Technique (POST) variant replaced the original reticule-scan analog seeker of the Redeye with a dual IR and ultraviolet (UV) detector. The new seeker enhanced the missile's target detection capabilities, allowing it to discriminate between a target, countermeasures, and background clutter. Development of Stinger-POST began in 1971, with production running from 1981 to 1987. By 1987, when production of both the basic Stinger and Stinger-POST ended, more than 15,000 basic Stingers and almost 600 Stinger POST missiles had been produced.|$|E
30|$|Reflective or semi-reflective {{elements}} (detector or reticle) {{are installed}} at the focal plane of the lens used in various types of <b>optical</b> <b>seekers.</b> When exposed to a laser beam, the collimated reflected light returned from the original path can be generated. The reflected light energy is usually higher. The echo of the diffuse target is 102 to 104 times stronger. This characteristic is {{commonly referred to as}} the “cat’s eye” effect. The echo image effect of “cat eye effect” is very beneficial to photoelectric detection and tracking. The active laser detection technology utilizes the principle of “cat’s eye” effect to realize scanning reconnaissance and recognition tracking of these optical targets by emitting laser beams. Traditional infrared passive detection methods, due to the temperature characteristics of the target skin, change in the angle of the reflected light of the target, and the incoming missile tail flame interferes with the image processing system, making it impossible to effectively extract the target of the optical window. There is no guarantee of tracking, and the laser irradiation spot always acts on the optical window of the target optoelectronic device. This solution uses laser active detection technology based on the image effect of the cat’s eye. It directly recognizes, tracks, and strikes the target’s optical system of the seeker’s incoming target, so its image tracking accuracy and laser exposure accuracy will be greatly improved. Compared with laser passive detection technology, laser active detection technology has higher positioning accuracy and faster detection speed. At present, research hotspots in China mainly focus on theoretical researches such as research on the characteristics of the “cat’s eye” target, and no mature equipment has yet been applied to actual combat.|$|R
5000|$|US {{interest}} in television guidance essentially {{ended in the}} post-war period. Nevertheless, small scale development continued, and a team at the Naval Ordnance Test Station (NOTS) developed a way to automatically track light or dark spots on a television image, a concept today known as an <b>optical</b> contrast <b>seeker.</b> Early use of the AGM-12 Bullpup demonstrated that the [...] "silver bullet" [...] was too difficult to use and exposed the launch aircraft to anti-aircraft fire, {{and the need for}} a fire-and-forget weapon became clear. In January 1963, NOTS released a contact for a bomb and guidance system that could be used with their tracker. In spite of being a glide bomb, this was confusingly assigned a number as part of the new guided missile numbering system, becoming the AGM-62 Walleye.|$|R
50|$|The Blue Eye was a {{development}} of the AGM-12 Bullpup, intended {{to provide a more}} advanced homing system. The Bullpup was manually steered onto the target, whereas the guidance system in the Blue Eye was an <b>optical</b> area correlation <b>seeker.</b> A TV camera in the missile's nose provided an image to the pilot; he used this to select the target and lock the missile on before firing. Once launched the area correlation system could detect any deviation of the picture compared to the locked image and correct the missile's course accordingly.|$|R
30|$|The {{main reason}} that the passive imaging system cannot work {{effectively}} in the above environments and fields is that the energy radiated by the target is too weak or the grayscale contrast to the background radiation is insufficient, and it cannot be recognized by the imaging detector. This paper proposes that {{in the field of}} optoelectronic countermeasures, the target laser is used to illuminate the target with the same wavelength of illumination laser as the incoming target <b>optical</b> <b>seeker</b> to achieve the echo effect of the cat’s eye, and the echo amplitude of the seeker’s seeker at the progression level is amplified, relying on effective low-grayscale dynamic image differential processing algorithm, fast cut target and background image, and capture targets in a complex background in time [9 – 12]. This paper starts with the detection and recognition technology of long-range weak targets based on image information and studies the image information acquisition and real-time capture techniques for long-range weak targets under low illumination and complex background conditions. The factors influencing the extraction of optical system targets include complex background radiation, rapid dynamic motion of targets, scattering of atmospheric aerosols, atmospheric turbulence, the diameter of the seeker’s target optical system, focal length, defocus amount, laser wavelength, laser energy, and optical system transparency, over-rate, and atmospheric aerosol scattering. This paper discusses the current mechanism of laser active detection through theoretical analysis and establishes a fast image difference algorithm. Through the analysis of the detection distance and the clear edge of the lighting image tracking accuracy, simulation calculations have obtained specific indicators. The results of calculation and simulation were verified by equal proportion external field experiments. It was proved that this kind of high-dynamic and low-gray target image differential capture technology based on laser active detection has very good effectiveness [13 – 17].|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The millimeter-wave {{terminal}} guidance ammunition monitoring scanning field is small. The modified design {{is in order}} to improve the search section trajectory guidance. This study established seeker search area to capture the target model, which leads to the missile engine unpowered glide distance formula after flameout. At the millimeter-wave terminal on the missiles contraction section ballistic. Each missile is designed for the flat road, the swash decline ballistic programs. Flat missile road program scans and does not shrink. Its flight speed falls and declines rapidly, has different gliding distance and terminal velocity. After the missile engine is flameout, its start-gliding speed is great. Ramp fell ballistic program enhances the air-air (or air-ground) guided missile’s gliding ability, helping to improve range. But shortcomings are that target tracking scanning domain contracts. Using the <b>seeker</b> <b>optical</b> axis in the pitch direction can achieve accurate positioning with the height precession. Two ballistic designs can both meet the target seeker’s scanning, thus effectively improve the striking precision...|$|R
40|$|Subject of Research. The paper {{deals with}} {{operating}} principles of <b>optical</b> pulse target <b>seekers</b> based on quadrant photodiode when targets {{are located in}} short-range field region. Method. Target image shape and light intensity distribution can affect static characteristics and cause appearance of image energy maximums when targets are located in short-range field region. Physical modeling of static characteristics plotting process was carried out. The main idea of the proposed method lies in counting sums of image pixels intensities in every virtual area of the sensor while virtual frame of the whole photodetector is moving over the target image. Main Results. Most probable target illumination directions were analyzed. Critical distances when the first extra image energy maximum appears were calculated for every target illumination directions. Time of missile uncontrollable flight at a near miss distance was also estimated. Practical Relevance. Research results point out that using of control loop proper logic is required to provide reliable target shot down for active and semi-active laser homing systems. Also disabling of such systems should be carried out when targets are located in short-range field region...|$|R
40|$|NATO-SCI- 139 and its {{predecessor}} groups {{have more than}} a decade of history in the evaluation and recommendation of EO and IR Countermeasures against anti-aircraft missiles. Surrogate Seekers have proven to be a valuable tool for this work. The use of surrogate seekers in international co-operations has several advantages over the use of an operational seeker, which is in service or in development: 1) the system is flexible, allowing both hardware and software modifications to be made in order to test the effectiveness of specific IRCM techniques; 2) the seeker design is open – every last parameter is available to the science team, allowing detailed, end-to-end validation of software models and simulations; 3) the availability of an unclassified seeker facilitates open discussions on CM issues between the participants in the NATO-group. Testing of high intensity countermeasures (for example based on lasers) needs a system with realistic seeker optics, with proper representation of <b>optical</b> scatter in <b>seeker</b> optics, which differs from scatter in commercial infrared camera optics. A technical description of the ISS is given: an overview of the optical design and the detector, the principle of the tracking software and the possibilities to implement alternative tracking algorithms in order to represent different threat CCM techniques. The ISS is built for use both in the laboratory and in the field. Finally, some experimental results will be presented...|$|R
