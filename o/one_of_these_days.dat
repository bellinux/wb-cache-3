This Mass was not included in editions of the Roman Missal before the time of Pope Pius XII.

25|$|The {{increased}} {{sensitivity of}} the site meant that in 1996 the Wye River Accords, part of the Arab-Israeli peace process, included a temporary status agreement for the site restricting access for both Jews and Muslims. As part of this agreement, the waqf (Islamic charitable trust) controls 81% of the building. This includes {{the whole of the}} southeastern section, which lies above the only known entrance to the caves and possibly over the entirety of the caves themselves. In consequence, Jews are not permitted to visit the Cenotaphs of Isaac or Rebecca, which lie entirely within the southeastern section, except for 10 days a year that hold special significance in Judaism. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>days</b> is the Shabbat Chayei Sarah, when the Torah portion concerning the death of Sarah and the purchase by Abraham of the land in which the caves are situated, is read.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} ritual {{practices}} and beliefs {{are associated with}} birth among the Tanala. In the past, after delivery of a baby the mother would wash {{her hands in the}} blood of a freshly sacrificed chicken, bathe herself in hot water, and then rest upright beside a fire to make her sweat out impurities. The period that she needed to stay beside the fire varied; noblewomen might stay beside the fire for as long as several months, but more commonly the duration was eight days. Immediately after this period beside the fire was concluded, a party was held, which the mother had to attend regardless of her condition; the event was marked by the slaughter of zebu. Immediately after birth, the baby would be bathed in cold water, and a sorcerer would declare certain days to be lifelong fady (taboo days); if a baby was born on a day that was fady for both the mother and father, the child would be abandoned to die. In addition, there are eight fady days per month for all Tanala, and historically if a child was born on <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>days,</b> it would be drowned by holding its head in a water-filled winnowing pan.|$|E

McClellan wrote to his wife, [...] "Those in whose {{judgment}} I rely tell me that I fought the battle splendidly {{and that it was}} a masterpiece of art. ...

500|$|Two {{weeks later}} in the Super Bowl, the Falcons played the Broncos, the game pitting coach Dan Reeves against his former team and their star quarterback, John Elway. Reeves had led the Broncos to three Super Bowl appearances, all losses, and he was fired as the Broncos' head coach after the 1992 NFL season. Afterward, Elway was quoted as saying, [...] "These last three years have been hell. I know I {{would not have been}} back here if Dan Reeves had been here. It wasn't worth it to me. I didn't enjoy it. It wasn't any fun, and I got tired of working with him." [...] Reeves responded by saying, [...] "Just tell him it wasn't exactly heaven for me either. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>days</b> I hope he grows up. Maybe he'll mature sometime." [...] During his tenure, Reeves had also fired Shanahan, who was an {{assistant}} coach on the team, and these points of contention became a media storyline entering the game.

Instead, the writers created the role of Rolph, {{and several of the}} actors suggested James Urbaniak be cast in the role.

[...] Jennie Tan, the creator of The Office fansite OfficeTally.com, appeared as an extra during the picnic scenes; her site has grown so large she has become known by the cast and crew of the show, who invited her to appear on the season finale. Brian Stack, a writer and actor on Late Night with Conan O'Brien and The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien, had a small role as the Buffalo branch employee who yells angrily at David Wallace. The Office editor Dave Rogers makes a cameo appearance as the volleyball player who tells Andy he is wearing expensive sunglasses.

[...] (Sometimes this last threat was simply abbreviated: as [...] "Bang, zoom!") On other occasions, Ralph simply told Alice, [...] "Oh, are you gonna get yours." [...] All of this led to criticism, more than 40 years later, that the show displayed an acceptance of domestic violence. But, Ralph never carried out his threats, and others have pointed out that Alice knew he never would because of their deep love for each other In retaliation, the targets of Ralph's verbal abuse often responded by simply joking about his weight, a common theme throughout the series.
