5|$|Later, Hill {{attacked}} both Fielding and Smart, 13 August 1752, in the <b>only</b> <b>issue</b> of The Impertinent to be produced. Although {{the work}} was published anonymously, it was commonly known that it was produced by Hill, and he soon followed up the pamphlet with his 25 August 1752 The Inspector column in the London Daily Advertiser. With the column, he harshly criticized Smart's Poems on Several Occasions. Fielding eventually left the dispute after the sixth issue of The Covent-Garden Journal was published.|$|E

5|$|The Freshman Issue {{is another}} {{special edition of}} the Technique. It is the first issue {{published}} each academic year and {{is by far the}} longest issue, with each of the sections about as long as a normal issue. The content usually centers on the themes of welcoming Freshmen and welcoming returning students back to Tech. The Freshman Issue also contains a special section dedicated to helping Freshmen become more acquainted with Tech and its customs. It is generally the <b>only</b> <b>issue</b> in which content from previous issues is reprinted.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the stadium}} was opened on time, the late sod {{was not the}} <b>only</b> <b>issue</b> on opening day. The stadium's seats, which had {{previously}} been installed in Atlanta's Fulton County Stadium, arrived just in time. Construction of the backstop was still being completed on opening day. Players for both the Sounds and the visiting Braves had concerns {{about the safety of}} playing on the quickly installed infield, initially refusing to even play on the surface. Left fielders complained about the extra-steep slope in left field that prevented them from seeing home plate. Only two women's restrooms and one men's restroom were functioning; a few portable toilets were also available.|$|E
5|$|An error as to a {{precedent}} fact, if committed, deprives the public authority {{of power to}} take the action or make the decision in question. The existence or non-existence of the fact, {{as the case may}} be, is a condition precedent or prerequisite to the exercise of the power. An example of an error of this nature {{can be found in the}} United Kingdom case White & Collins v. Minister of Health (1939). In that case, under the relevant statute, the authority could <b>only</b> <b>issue</b> a compulsory purchase order affecting the applicants' land if it was not part of, among other things, a park. A minister confirmed the purchase order but the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that it should be quashed, finding that the minister could not exercise power to acquire the land since it was part of a park. Whether the land was or was not a park was {{a precedent}} fact, and the minister had committed an error concerning this fact.|$|E

5|$|The {{office of}} {{quaestor}} {{was considered the}} lowest-ranking of all major political offices. Quaestors were elected by the Tribal Assembly, and the assignment of their responsibilities was settled by lot. Magistrates often chose which quaestor accompanied them abroad, and these quaestors often functioned as personal secretaries responsible for the allocation of money, including army pay. Urban quaestors had several important responsibilities, such as {{the management of the}} public treasury, (the aerarium Saturni) where they monitored all items going into, and coming out of, the treasury. In addition, they often spoke publicly about the balances available in the treasury. The quaestors could <b>only</b> <b>issue</b> public money for a particular purpose if they were authorized to do so by the senate. The quaestors were assisted by scribes, who handled the actual accounting for the treasury. The treasury was a repository for documents, as well as for money. The texts of enacted statutes and decrees of the Roman Senate were deposited in the treasury {{under the supervision of the}} quaestors.|$|E

These universities <b>only</b> <b>issue</b> garland on the graduation day to new graduates and <b>only</b> <b>issue</b> mortar boards to chancellor, vice chancellor and registrars. Private universities issue mortar boards to graduates along with a hood in place of garland.|$|E

25|$|The Magyarization policy {{actually}} took shape {{as early as}} the 1830s, when Hungarian started replacing Latin and German in education. Magyarization lacked any religious, racial or otherwise exclusionary component. Language was the <b>only</b> <b>issue.</b> The eagerness of the Hungarian government in its Magyarization efforts was comparable to that of tsarist Russification from the late 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{extended}} usage of pallet-wide containers in Europe the EU started the Intermodal Loading Unit (ILU) initiative. This showed advantages for intermodal transport of containers and swap bodies. This {{led to the}} introduction of ILU-Codes defined by the standard EN 13044 which has the same format as the earlier BIC-Codes. The International Container Office BIC agreed to <b>only</b> <b>issue</b> ownership codes ending with U, J or Z. The new allocation office of the UIRR (International Union of Combined Road-Rail Transport Companies) agreed to <b>only</b> <b>issue</b> ownership reporting marks for swap bodies ending with A, B, C, D or K – companies having a BIC-Code ending with U can allocate an ILU-Code ending with K having the same preceding letters. Since July 2011 the new ILU codes can be registered, beginning with July 2014 all intermodal ISO containers and intermodal swap bodies must have an ownership code and by July 2019 all of them must bear a standard-conforming placard.|$|E

If convicted in court, an individual found guilty of contempt of Congress may be imprisoned for up to one year.|$|E

25|$|Rabbinic interpretation: (Modern) Orthodoxy {{contends that}} legal {{authority}} is cumulative, {{and that a}} contemporary posek (decisor) can <b>only</b> <b>issue</b> judgments based on a full history of Jewish legal precedent, whereas the implicit argument of the Conservative movement is that precedent provides illustrations of possible positions rather than binding law. Conservatism, therefore, remains free to select whichever position within the prior history appeals to it.|$|E
25|$|On 12 August 2015, Mordechai Vanunu and {{his wife}} applied for family reunification via the Norwegian embassy in Tel Aviv. Vanunu’s exit to Norway must be {{accepted}} by Israel and his entry approved by Norway. Norway had previously said that they could <b>only</b> <b>issue</b> emergency passports {{to people who are}} already on Norwegian soil. However, his wife is a Professor at the School of Theology in Oslo, and thus fulfills the requirement that one must be able to provide for their spouse.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} his late teens that {{it was pointed out}} that he would turn into an {{international}} wicket-keeper, as he was a budding fast bowler that was building up a good reputation at junior level. He was clocked at 75mph at the age of 14, although the <b>only</b> <b>issue</b> was that the majority of his bowling was waist-high. He then moved onto unorthodox off-breaks, which were deemed illegal right from the start, and so he started to keep wicket for his school.|$|E

25|$|Joseph Smith, {{as mayor}} {{of the town of}} Nauvoo, Illinois, had ordered the {{destruction}} of the facilities producing the Nauvoo Expositor, a newly established newspaper set up by a group of non-Mormons and people who had seceded from the church. The newspaper's first (and <b>only)</b> <b>issue</b> was deeply critical of Smith and other church leaders—reporting that Smith was practicing polygamy and claiming he intended to set himself up as a theocratic king. In response, Smith declared the paper a public nuisance and ordered its press destroyed.|$|E
25|$|While councils (can. 445) and diocesan synods (can. 391 & 466) {{have full}} {{legislative}} powers in their areas of competence, national episcopal conferences may <b>only</b> <b>issue</b> supplementary legislation when authorized {{to do so}} in canon law or by decree of the Holy See. Additionally, any such supplemental legislation requires a two-thirds vote of the conference and review by the Holy See (can. 455) to have the force of law. Without such authorization and review, episcopal conferences are deliberative only and exercise no authority over their member bishops or dioceses.|$|E
25|$|The loss {{of almost}} all of their land was not the <b>only</b> <b>issue</b> that the Havasupai were contending with: the {{increase}} in the number of settlers in the local region had depleted game used for hunting, and soil erosion (a result of poor irrigation techniques) touched off a series of food shortages. Furthermore, interaction with the settlers sparked deadly disease outbreaks amongst tribe members, who were ravaged by smallpox, influenza, and measles. By 1906 only 166 tribal members remainedhalf the number Garces saw when he first came across the tribe in 1776.|$|E
