25|$|One {{potential}} {{motive for}} the novel, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> political inspiration, was Behn's view that Surinam was a fruitful and potentially wealthy settlement that needed only a true noble to lead it. Like others sent to investigate the colony, she felt that Charles was not properly informed of the place's potential. When Charles gave up Surinam in 1667 with the Treaty of Breda, Behn was dismayed. This dismay is enacted in the novel in a graphic fashion: if the English, with their aristocracy, mismanaged the colony and the slaves by having an insufficiently noble ruler there, then the democratic and mercantile Dutch would be far worse. Accordingly, the passionate misrule of Byam is replaced by the efficient and immoral management of the Dutch. Charles had a strategy for a united North American presence, however, and his gaining of New Amsterdam for Surinam {{was part of that}} larger vision. Neither Charles II nor Aphra Behn could have known how correct Charles's bargain was, but Oroonoko {{can be seen as a}} royalist's demurral.|$|E
25|$|He had luck in {{the latter}} statement. In most {{amphibian}} organs including the heart, the concentration of adrenaline far exceeds that of noradrenaline, and adrenaline is indeed the main transmitter. In mammals, however, difficulties arose. In a comprehensive structure-activity study of adrenaline-like compounds, Dale and the chemist George Barger in 1910 pointed out that Elliott’s hypothesis assumed a stricter parallelism between the effects of sympathetic nerve impulses and adrenaline than actually existed. For example, sympathetic impulses shared with adrenaline contractile effects in the trigone but not relaxant effects in the fundus of the cat′s urinary bladder. In this respect, ″amino-ethanol-catechol″ – noradrenaline – mimicked sympathetic nerves more closely than adrenaline did. The Harvard Medical School physiologist Walter Bradford Cannon, who had popularized {{the idea of a}} sympatho-adrenal system preparing the body for fight and flight, and his colleague Arturo Rosenblueth developed an elaborate but ″queer″ theory of two sympathins, sympathin E (excitatory) and sympathin I (inhibitory). The Belgian pharmacologist Zénon Bacq as well as Canadian and US-American pharmacologists between 1934 and 1938 suggested that noradrenaline might be the – <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> – postganglionic sympathetic transmitter. However, nothing definite was brought to light till after the war. In the meantime, Dale created a terminology that since has imprinted the thinking of neuroscientists: that nerve cells should be named after their transmitter, i.e. cholinergic if the transmitter was ″a substance like acetylcholine", and adrenergic if it was ″some substance like adrenaline″.|$|E

[...] Writing for Billboard in 2001, Bill Holland grouped [...] "Only a Northern Song" [...] with the Byrds' [...] "So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star" [...] and early-1970s releases by the Kinks and Joni Mitchell, as songs that constitute {{the first wave of}} musical statements in which artists [...] "accuse or indict their industry's business policies".

2500|$|Initially Tejada {{developed}} a Hispanidad-oriented leadership theory of authoritarian state; {{according to some}} in the early 1940s he performed a volte-face becoming a vehement anti-Francoist, according to the others during decades to come his theory was progressively dissociated from Francoism, some see 3 phases of his evolution and some advance rambling summaries.

2500|$|... "Pseudohermaphroditism" [...] has, {{until very}} recently, been the term {{used in the}} medical {{literature}} to describe the condition of an individual whose gonads and karyotype do not match the external genitalia in the gender binary sense.

[...] A survey of French arms granted during the seventeenth century reveals a distinct split between the trends for the arms granted to nobles and commoners. [...] Among nobles, gules remained the most common tincture, closely followed by or, then by argent and azure at nearly equal levels; sable was a very distant fifth choice, while vert remained scarce. [...] Among commoners, azure was easily the most common tincture, followed by or, and only then by gules, argent, and sable, which was used more by commoners than among the nobility; vert, however, was even scarcer in common arms.
