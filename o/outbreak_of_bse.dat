BSE examination, killing and decontamination costs amounted to 18. 9 million CZK, compensation costs for killed animals reached almost 163. 9 million CZK and compensation for unaccomplished production accounted for over 13. 6 million CZK.

40|$|Abstract. The {{scientific}} community is divided {{in support of}} two major hypotheses of the controversial etiology of the Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE) variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The two hypotheses are the prion theory and the virus theory in conjunction with nemaviruses. The purpose of this review is to describe and understand these two major hypotheses in order to conclude which one is the most acceptable by analyzing the evidence that is available. Although {{it appears that the}} majority of the {{scientific community}} supports the theory based on prions, there is limited evidence to support how prions carry out their functions without genetic material. The foundation of the prion hypothesis relies on the belief that the infectious agent is too small to be a virus and that nucleic acids are not present. However, the overwhelming number of viral- like features exhibited by the infectious agent including the detection of nucleic acid binding proteins, the phenomenon of interference, and the number of strain mutations and variations has led us to conclude that the agent is indeed a virus. The hysteria caused by the <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> the <b>BSE</b> induced vCJD outbreak in the United Kingdom reflects the danger of the high transmissibility of the infectious agent and the importance of its identification in order to create preventative procedures and treatments...|$|R

Our interest is motivated primarily by the presence of market power that is alleged to occur in UK food retailing.

We also account for different aspects of the BSE crisis including the shift in the retail demand function as well as the shift in the farm supply function (due to the mutually opposing effects of a worldwide export ban and the cull of infected and older beef cattle) and control for the possibility of substitution by consumers.

From a theoretical perspective we show that if market power has an effect on the spread between retail and farm prices then this determines the specification of the co-integrating relationship. We also account for different aspects of the BSE crisis including the shift in the retail demand function as well as the shift in the farm supply function due to the mutually opposing effects of a worldwide export ban and the cull of infected and older beef cattle. The empirical results suggest that the impact of the BSE crisis on farm prices to be more than double that of retail prices, the main cause of the change in the retail-farm price spread being the shift in the consumer demand function. Our calculations suggest that the numbers removed via the cull offset the loss of exports, so that the net effect of the BSE crisis on prices is due to the depressed stated of demand.

40|$|The Danish poultry {{industry}} {{shifted to the}} use of feed derived from genetically-modified (GM) soybeans in February 2014, causing the potential for CO 2 emissions from land-use change in Argentina and Brazil to meet the demand. This problem is investigated within a framework of “hybrid geography” and actor-network theory, allowing for a mixed method investigation of the interconnections between both human and nonhumans. These heterogeneous networks are traced out by following the natural, social, economic and political developments which came to influence the Danish {{poultry industry}}’s shift, which is further quantitatively linked to its potential impact on carbon stock levels from the spatial expansion of GM soybeans. The analysis focuses on the differing lengths of and connections between GM and non-GM soybean networks, and how technologies such as the rendering of meat and bone meal, GM, and agricultural cultivation mobilized change within the social and natural worlds. These technologies were able to facilitate highly interconnected and expansive networks due to their efficiency and economic benefits, but also had unintended side-effects on natural networks, which “kicked back” in the form of BSE, “super weeds” and CO 2 emissions. The <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> strengthened the EU’s reliance on soymeal for feed, and lead to EU regulatory change which did not require the labeling of animals fed with genetically modified feed. As a result, the GM-free “quality” of Danish poultry was not identifiable for consumers. The lack of labeling combined with the comparative inefficiency of cultivation, dwindling supply and extra administrative costs related to non-GM feed reduced the competitiveness of the Danish poultry industry, motivating the shift in feed. Over 115, 000 hectares of land would have to change to facilitate the shifting demand, leading to highly differing CO 2 emissions depending largely on the type of vegetation on the changed land. Lack of precise data limits the conclusiveness, and motivates case-by-case evaluation of future changes in agricultural production and land-use, to account for environmental externalities...|$|E

Methodology: This community-based, cross-sectional study was carried out among a total sample of 200 women in rural area of Trichy. The participants were interviewed using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire to obtain information on their sociodemographic characteristics, awareness on breast cancer, and knowledge, attitude, practice <b>of</b> <b>BSE.</b> Data were entered into MS Excel and analyzed using SPSS version 20. 0.
