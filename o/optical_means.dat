25|$|A {{common cause}} of low visual acuity is {{refractive}} error (ametropia), or errors in how the light is refracted in the eyeball. Causes of refractive errors include aberrations {{in the shape of}} the eyeball, the shape of the cornea, and reduced flexibility of the lens. Too high or too low refractive error (in relation to the length of the eyeball) is the cause of nearsightedness (myopia) or farsightedness (hyperopia) (normal refractive status is referred to as emmetropia). Other optical causes are astigmatism or more complex corneal irregularities. These anomalies can mostly be corrected by <b>optical</b> <b>means</b> (such as eyeglasses, contact lenses, laser surgery, etc.).|$|E

2500|$|The {{most common}} {{way to treat}} forms of aniseikonia, {{including}} macropsia, is {{through the use of}} auxiliary optics to correct for the magnification properties of the eyes. [...] This method includes changing the shape of spectacle lenses, changing the vertex distances with contact lenses, creating a weak telescope system with contact lenses and spectacles, and changing the power of one of the spectacle lenses. [...] Computer software, such as the Aniseikonia Inspector, has been developed to determine the prescription needed to correct for a certain degree of aniseikonia. [...] The problem with correction through <b>optical</b> <b>means</b> is that the optics do not vary with field angle and thus cannot compensate for non-uniform macropsia. [...] Patients have reported significantly improved visual comfort associated with a correction of 5-10% of the aniseikonia.|$|E

It will be observed that the two processes lead to almost exactly the same result, and therefore the fairness of the photographic process may be taken for granted.

However, many people cannot take advantage of this because of the limited dilation of the human pupil. To overcome this, soldiers were sometimes issued atropine eye drops to dilate pupils.|$|E
