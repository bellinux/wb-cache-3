5|$|Tinker {{had serious}} health {{problems}} in his later life. Complications of diabetes mellitus and Bright's disease left Tinker near death in 1936, when his physician believed he had 24 hours to live, and 1944, when he was placed in an <b>oxygen</b> <b>tent.</b> However, he returned to health and scouted minor league players for the Boston Braves in 1946. Tinker developed an infection relating to diabetes that in 1947 required the amputation of a toe and persisted until his left leg above the knee was amputated as well. Tinker died at Orange Memorial Hospital in Orlando on July 27, 1948, his 68th birthday, of complications from diabetes. He was buried in Greenwood Cemetery and survived by his four children.|$|E

He was taken ill during the runs of pantomimes in both 1918 and 1919, was forced to rest for three months in 1919, and collapsed on stage during a performance in Newcastle upon Tyne in the 1920–21 pantomime season. Formby was advised by doctors to emigrate to South Africa for the benefit of his health, but he preferred to stay in Britain, with his wife and children, and continued to work. During his performances his wife would wait in the wings with ice for him to suck to stop internal bleeding, and an <b>oxygen</b> <b>tent</b> was present in the stage wings ready for emergencies.|$|E

2500|$|The {{profession}} of respiratory care was officially {{established in the}} United States c. 1930; and respiratory research has officially existed since the early 1900s.

In general, it is advisable not to smoke or have any inflammable material within the vicinity of any oxygen apparatus.

5000|$|Industry of the Ordinary's work {{deals with}} themes of faith, freedom, politics, youth culture, celebrity, {{competitive}} sports, sex and drinking. They often employ collaborative strategies, as in their piece 39 Verbs, {{for which they}} commissioned fellow arts professionals to create 39 works inspired by arbitrarily assigned verbs taken from their previous works' titles. This emphasis on collaboration subverts traditional conceptions of art creation as highly individualistic, calling into question the elitism of the institutional art world. Works like Celebrity and the Peculiar, an installation of <b>oxygen</b> <b>tents</b> suffused by humidifiers with various celebrity perfumes, question popular culture's obsession with notoriety and our individual attempts to identify with celebrities. IOTO's preoccupation with public interaction and stated intention that their work {{be completed by the}} creative interpretation and engagement of the audience has led some critics to categorize their work within the umbrella of Relational Aesthetics. Their work has also been linked to the Situationist International and Fluxus movements. Their public interventions, usually ephemeral and existing afterwards only in the form of documentary photographs, videos, or text, has also been compared to the Happenings of the 1960s. One piece, Re-Work (for Allan Kaprow, Marina Abramović and Philip-Lorca diCorcia), re-imagines Allan Kaprow's delegated performance, Work. In his original, Kaprow hired professional house painters to paint and re-paint the hallway of a gallery space. For their Re-Work at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, IOTO hired two sex workers to perform the same task while wearing their [...] "professional" [...] attire. Just as Kaprow's piece questioned the distinction of artist by contracting out the actual art-making process, IOTO's piece questions our assumptions about the nature of, and our subsequent judgements of, certain types of labor.|$|R
40|$|Many {{people who}} live in the low {{altitude}} areas are often suffered from hypoxia when they entered the high plateau. This problem may seriously influence the physical and mental state and work efficacy for the travelers and workers. Oxygen enrichment of a small space air at high altitude is considered as a simple way to provide lowlanders enriched oxygen for sleeping and resting, improving work efficiency, so we developed an oxygen concentration machine based on the technology of oxygen enrichment membrane. This paper tested 8 healthy male lowlanders (age 21. 63 ± 1. 77 yr) who have never exposed to plateau performed an incremental exercise on cycle ergometer at sea-level in order to be used as sea-level controls. Two days later, the same subjects were taken to Lhasa (3700 m) by air and exposed to the plateau, performed the same exercise as they did at sea-level. The next day, all subjects were asked to enter the experimental tent which was enriched with oxygen (higher than 24 %) by the oxygen concentration machine and sleep for 10 hours at night, then exposed to plateau and performed the same exercise twice at different time (2 hours and 10 hours after oxygen enrichment). During the tests, subjects must cycled continuously at 60 rpm beginning with a 3 min exercise intensity of 0 W followed by incremental increases of 25 W every 3 min until 150 W, pulse oxygen saturation (SpO 2) and heart rate (HR) were recorded. After sleeping in an <b>oxygen</b> enrichment of <b>tent</b> air, 2 hours later, the subjects’ load capacity had no difference compared with control group, but significant difference than before (higher SpO 2 and lower HR), which indicated that oxygen concentration machine is effective in increasing the oxygen concentration of the air for the tent and sleeping in the <b>oxygen</b> enrichment <b>tent</b> for l 0 h might be effective in improving exercise performance during high-altitude hypoxia. At the same time, 10 hours later, when work-load exceeded 125 W, the same effects were also found. The results indicated the effects of <b>oxygen</b> enrichment of <b>tent</b> air could last a certain period of time...|$|R

2500|$|In 2015 the {{president}} of the Nepal Mountaineering Association warned that pollution, especially human waste, has reached critical levels. As much as [...] "26,500 pounds of human excrement" [...] each season is left behind on the mountain. Human waste is strewn across the verges of the route to the summit, making the four sleeping areas on the route up Everest's south side minefields of human excrement. Climbers above Base Camp—for the 62-year history of climbing on the mountain—have most commonly either buried their excrement in holes they dug by hand in the snow, or slung it into crevasses, or simply defecated wherever convenient, often within meters of their tents. The only place where climbers can defecate without worrying about contaminating the mountain is Base Camp. At approximately 18,000 feet, Base Camp sees the most activity of all camps on Everest because climbers acclimate and rest there. In the late-1990s, expeditions began using toilets that they fashioned from blue plastic 50-gallon barrels fitted with a toilet seat and enclosed. The problem of human waste is compounded by the presence of more anodyne waste: spent <b>oxygen</b> tanks, abandoned <b>tents,</b> empty cans and bottles. The Nepalese government now requires each climber to pack out eight kilograms of waste when descending the mountain.|$|R

This fact can lead to unnecessary use of O 2 via facial tent. Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify the variations or FiO 2, SatO 2 and RR in different oxygen flows through race tent in patients without main diagnostk caused by pulmonary disease. Methodology: We studied the FiO 2 SaO 2 and RR In 20 patients breathing spontaneously, without main diagnostic caused by pulmonary disease when submited to oxygen therapy in facial tent with flows or 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 15 liters/minute of oxygen (1 /m O 2). Results: The FiO 2 varied from 23, 95 % (± 2, 46 %) with l 1 /m O 2 from 96, 30 % (± 0, 86 %) with 1 1 /m O 2 to 98, 75 % (± 0, 85 %) with 15 1 /m O 2 RR varied from 22, 8 bpm (± 6, 06) with 11 /m 0 1 to 23, 15 bpm (± 5, 84) with 15 1 /m O 2 Conclusion: Through this study was possible to obtain mean values of FiO 2 with oxygen flows of 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, l 5 1 /m O 2 administered by facial tent and, based In the variations of SaO 2 and RR, it also shows that use of <b>oxygen</b> via face <b>tent</b> is several times unnecessary in patients without main diagnostic caused by pulmonary disease.
