50|$|Monodisperse powders of {{colloidal}} silica, for example, {{may therefore}} be stabilized sufficiently {{to ensure a}} high degree of order in the <b>colloidal</b> crystal <b>or</b> polycrystalline <b>colloidal</b> solid which results from aggregation. The degree of order appears to be limited by the time and space allowed for longer-range correlations to be established.|$|R
50|$|Polyelectrolytes {{are charged}} {{polymers}} capable of stabilizing (<b>or</b> destabilizing) <b>colloidal</b> emulsions through electrostatic interactions. Their effectiveness can {{be dependent on}} molecular weight, pH, solvent polarity, ionic strength, and the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB). Stabilized emulsions are useful in many industrial processes, including deflocculation, drug delivery, petroleum waste treatment, and food technology.|$|R
30|$|Core-shell <b>or</b> hollow <b>colloidal</b> {{photonic}} crystals {{have revealed}} special optical properties and chemical sensing as reported elsewhere[7, 16 – 18]. In this study, we built upon a core-shell colloidal technique to fabricate inverse opals.

50|$|The U.S. Food and Drug Administration {{recommends}} {{applying a}} wet compress or soaking {{the affected area}} in cool water; topical corticosteroids (available over-the-counter) or oral corticosteroids (available by prescription); and topical skin protectants, such as zinc acetate, zinc carbonate, zinc oxide, and calamine. Baking soda <b>or</b> <b>colloidal</b> oatmeal can relieve minor irritation and itching. Aluminium acetate, sometimes known as Burow's solution, can also ease the rash.|$|E
50|$|Colloidal gold is a sol <b>or</b> <b>colloidal</b> {{suspension}} of nanoparticles {{of gold in}} a fluid, usually water. The liquid is usually either an intense red colour (for particles less than 100 nm) or blue/purple (for larger particles).Due to the unique optical, electronic, and molecular-recognition properties of gold nanoparticles, they {{are the subject of}} substantial research, with applications {{in a wide variety of}} areas, including electron microscopy, electronics, nanotechnology, and materials science.|$|E

In these emergency situations, a plasma expander is a more effective life-saving procedure than a blood transfusion, because the metabolism of transfused red blood cells does not restart immediately after a transfusion.|$|E
30|$|The {{nondestructive}} {{methods for}} separating CNTs couple well-dispersed colloidal suspensions of tubes/particles with materials which prevent aggregation such as surfactants, polymers, <b>or</b> other <b>colloidal</b> particles [37]. The other method as aim of size exclusion nanotubes uses {{size exclusion chromatography}} and porous filters [37] as well as ultrasonically assisted microfiltration which purifies SWNTs from amorphous carbon and catalytic particles [38].|$|R
50|$|Gold {{clusters}} in cluster chemistry are gold-derived {{materials that}} {{can either be}} discrete molecules <b>or</b> larger <b>colloidal</b> particles.

50|$|Keim {{laid the}} {{foundation}} for the success of Keimfarben in 1878 with KEIM Purkristalat, a two-component pure silicate paint. The second generation of Keim paints followed in 1962 with Keim Granital, the first silicate emulsion paint; in contrast to Purkristalat, this is a one-component paint which makes it easier to apply. In 2002, Keimfarben then launched Keim Soldalit, a sol-silicate <b>or</b> <b>colloidal</b> silicate paint (binding agent: colloidal silica and water glass), which makes it much easier to apply silicate paints so that they are suitable for universal use.|$|E
50|$|The {{point of}} zero charge (pzc), in {{physical}} chemistry, {{is a concept}} relating to the phenomenon of adsorption, and it describes the condition when the electrical charge density on a surface is zero. It is usually determined in relation to an electrolyte's pH, and the pzc value is assigned to a given substrate <b>or</b> <b>colloidal</b> particle. For example, the pzc of solid FeOOH is 9. In other words, pzc is (usually) the pH value at which a solid submerged in an electrolyte exhibits zero net electrical charge on the surface.|$|E
50|$|C-41 film {{consists}} of an acetate or polyester film base, onto which multiple emulsions are coated. Each layer is only sensitive to a certain color of visible light. In the classic illustrative example, there are three emulsions: one is red sensitive, another is green sensitive, and the top is blue-sensitive. Beneath the blue layer is a yellow filter, composed of dyes <b>or</b> <b>colloidal</b> silver. All silver-based photographic emulsions have some sensitivity to blue light, regardless of what other colors they may be sensitized for. This filter layer serves to remove the blue light, which would expose the layers beneath it. Beneath the blue-sensitive layer and the yellow filter are the green and red sensitive layers.|$|E
5000|$|Inverse opals <b>or</b> Inverse <b>Colloidal</b> Crystals-Spheres (such as {{polystyrene}} or silicon dioxide) can {{be allowed}} to deposit into a cubic close packed lattice suspended in a solvent. Then a hardener is introduced that makes a transparent solid out of the volume occupied by the solvent. The spheres are then dissolved with an acid such as Hydrochloric acid. The colloids can be either spherical or nonspherical.|$|R
5000|$|Patchy {{particle}} is a {{term used}} to describe micron- <b>or</b> nanoscale <b>colloidal</b> particles that are anisotropically patterned, either by modification of the particle surface chemistry ("enthalpic patches"), through particle shape ("entropic patches"), or both. Patchy particles are used as a shorthand for modelling anisotropic colloids [...] and proteins [...] and for designing approaches to nanoparticle synthesis. Patchy particles range in valency from two (Janus particles) or higher.|$|R
50|$|VLS {{synthesis}} {{requires a}} catalyst. For nanowires, the best catalysts are liquid metal (such as gold) nanoclusters, which {{can either be}} self-assembled from a thin film by dewetting, <b>or</b> purchased in <b>colloidal</b> form and deposited on a substrate.|$|R
50|$|Oxymorphone is commercially {{produced}} from thebaine, {{which is a}} minor constituent of the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) but thebaine is found in greater abundance (3%) in {{the roots of the}} oriental poppy (Papaver orientale).German patents from the middle 1930s indicate that oxymorphone as well as hydromorphone, hydrocodone, oxycodone, and acetylmorphone can be prepared—without the need for hydrogen gas—from solutions of codeine, morphine, and dionine by refluxing an acidic aqueous solution, or the precursor drug dissolved in ethanol, in the presence of Column 7 metals, namely palladium and platinum in fine powder <b>or</b> <b>colloidal</b> form or platina black. It is unclear if aluminium or nickel {{can be used as a}} catalyst in these reactions.|$|E
50|$|Colloidal {{particles}} are {{the components of}} a colloid. A colloid is a substance microscopically dispersed evenly throughout another substance. Such colloidal system can be solid, liquid, or gaseous; as well as continuous or dispersed. The dispersed-phase particles have a diameter of between approximately 5 and 200 nanometers. Soluble particles smaller than this will form a solution {{as opposed to a}} colloid. Colloidal systems (also called colloidal solutions <b>or</b> <b>colloidal</b> suspensions) are the subject of interface and colloid science. Suspended solids may be held in a liquid, while solid or liquid particles suspended in a gas together form an aerosol. Particles may also be suspended in the form of atmospheric particulate matter, which may constitute air pollution. Larger particles can similarly form marine debris or space debris. A conglomeration of discrete solid, macroscopic particles may be described as a granular material.|$|E
5000|$|In 1912 Benjamin Moore {{summarized}} the main facet of photogeochemistry, that of inorganic photocatalysis: [...] "the inorganic colloid must possess {{the property of}} transforming sunlight, or some other form of radiant energy, into chemical energy." [...] Many experiments, still focused on how plants assimilate carbon, did indeed explore {{the effect of a}} [...] "transformer" [...] (catalyst); some effective [...] "transformers" [...] were similar to naturally occurring minerals, including iron(III) oxide <b>or</b> <b>colloidal</b> iron hydroxide; cobalt carbonate, copper carbonate, nickel carbonate; and iron(II) carbonate. Working with an iron oxide catalyst, Baly concluded in 1930 that [...] "the analogy between the laboratory process and that in the living plant seems therefore to be complete," [...] referring to his observation that in both cases, a photochemical reaction takes place on a surface, the activation energy is supplied in part by the surface and in part by light, efficiency decreases when the light intensity is too great, the optimal temperature of the reaction {{is similar to that of}} living plants, and efficiency increases from the blue to the red end of the light spectrum.|$|E
50|$|Experiments {{performed}} in microgravity on the Space Shuttle Columbia {{suggest that the}} typical face-centered cubic structure may be induced by gravitational stresses. Crystals tend to exhibit the hcp structure alone (random stacking of hexagonally close-packed crystal planes), in contrast {{with a mixture of}} (rhcp) and face-centred cubic packing when allowed sufficient time to reach mechanical equilibrium under gravitational forces on Earth. Glassy (disordered <b>or</b> amorphous) <b>colloidal</b> samples have become fully crystallized in microgravity in less than two weeks.|$|R
40|$|Colloidal {{structures}} {{assembled in}} confined nematic liquid crystals are examined. Theoretical predictions based on Landau-type approaches are complemented {{with the latest}} studies of laser assisted colloidal assembling. Effective colloidal interactions are particularly sensitive to the confinement and external fields. Their complexity leads to numerous stable <b>or</b> metastable <b>colloidal</b> superstructures not present in isotropic solvents. Particularly important are colloidal structures coupled by entangled disclinations. Such a string-like coupling is very robust and opens new routes to assemble new photonic materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{viscosity}} of complex, anisotropic fluids, such as liquid crystals <b>or</b> their <b>colloidal</b> suspensions, {{is characterized}} by a number of coefficients. Methods to measure them are, typically, sensitive only to their particular combinations, hence unable to determine them individually. Using an Ericksen-Leslie model and propagation of light through aligned layers of such materials, we show theoretically and verify experimentally how this degeneracy can be lifted by exploiting both the amplitude and frequency of the voltage applied to the cell as control parameters...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to treating the liquid waste excreted by fish {{the solid waste}} must also be treated, this is done by concentrating and flushing the solids out of the system. Removing solids reduces bacteria growth, oxygen demand, {{and the proliferation of}} disease. The simplest method for removing solids is the creation of settling basin where the relative velocity of the water is slow and particles can settle {{at the bottom of the}} tank where they are either flushed out or vacuumed out manually using a siphon. However, this method is not viable for RAS operations where a small footprint is desired. Typical RAS solids removal involves a sand filter or particle filter where solids become lodged and can be periodically backflushed out of the filter. Another common method is the use of a mechanical drum filter where water is run over a rotating drum screen that is periodically cleaned by pressurized spray nozzles, and the resulting slurry is treated or sent down the drain. In order to remove extremely fine particles <b>or</b> <b>colloidal</b> solids a protein fractionator may be used with or without the addition of ozone (O3).|$|E

The degree of order appears to be limited by the time and space allowed for longer-range correlations to be established.
