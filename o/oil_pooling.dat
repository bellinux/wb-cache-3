25|$|Oil {{extraction}} {{is simply}} the removal of oil from the reservoir (<b>oil</b> <b>pool).</b> <b>Oil</b> is often recovered as a water-in-oil emulsion, and specialty chemicals called demulsifiers are used to separate the oil from water.

30|$|The lower Cambrian Niutitang Formation {{hydrocarbon}} source {{rocks at}} the Dingshan-Lintanchang structure in the southeast Sichuan Basin were of medium-good quality with two excellent hydrocarbon-generating centers developed in the periphery areas, with a possibility of forming a medium to large-sized oil-gas field. Good reservoir rocks were the upper Sinian (Dengying Formation) dolomites. The mudstone in the lower Cambrian Niutitang Formation with a good sealing capacity was the cap rock. The widely occurring bitumen in the Dengying Formation indicates that a paleo <b>oil</b> <b>pool</b> was once formed in the study area. The first stage of paleo <b>oil</b> <b>pool</b> formation was maturation of the lower Cambrian source rocks during the late Ordovician. Hydrocarbon generation from the lower Cambrian source rocks stopped due to the Devonian-Carboniferous uplifting. The lower Cambrian source rocks then restarted generation of large quantities of hydrocarbons after deposition of the middle Permian sediments. This was {{the second stage of}} the paleo <b>oil</b> <b>pool</b> formation. The <b>oil</b> in the paleo <b>oil</b> <b>pool</b> began to crack during the late Triassic and a paleo gas pool was formed. This paleo gas pool was destroyed during the Yanshan-Himalayan folding, uplifting and denudation. Bitumen can be widely seen in the Dengying Formation in wells and outcrops in the Sichuan Basin and its periphery areas. This provides strong evidence that the Dengying Formation in the Sichuan Basin and its periphery areas was once an ultra-large structural-lithologic oil-gas field, which was damaged during the Yanshan-Himalayan period.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} enhance the fire {{suppression}} performance of water mist, a new multi-component additive of water mist is produced through physics process for the typical fire (<b>oil</b> <b>pool</b> fires and wood crib fires). To study {{the effectiveness of the}} water mist adding this new multi- component additive in fire suppression, a laboratory-scale suppression system was built and a series of tests were conducted in this system. The experimental result reveals that the fire suppression effectiveness of water mist is improved greatly by adding the multi-component additives, Along with increasing the amount of multi-component additives, the fire suppression time of <b>oil</b> <b>pool</b> fire drops rapidly, then increases slightly at some points; but the time of wood crib fire declines gently, then tends to become stable. Finally, the suppression mechanism is discussed so as to find out the deep relationship between the multi-component additive and suppression effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt is {{the fact}} that {{combustion}} properties of large-scale crude <b>oil</b> <b>pool</b> fire have great significance for security design and firefighting of current crude oil reserves. Burning rate, the flame shape and radiation intensity are the most important parameters for fires properties. According to two-zone theoretical model, there are many calculation models for different parameters. Based on crude <b>oil</b> <b>pool</b> fire experiments in Tomakomai, Japan, several common kinds of model are analyzed. Some conclusions are drawn: Babrauska formula is accurate around 10 m diameter; Thomas model is appropriate for the flame heighten of smaller scale(less than 5 m), while Heskestad model is appropriate for the flame heighten of larger scale (greater than 10 m); when the thermal radiation intensity is greater than 5 kW/m 2, Shokri Beyler model is more applicable; when the thermal radiation intensity is less than 1 kW/m 2, Point source model is more accurate...|$|R

50|$|He gave many {{examples}} of substantial and sometimes commercial quantities of petroleum being found in crystalline or metamorphic basements, or in sediments directly overlying those. He cited cases in Kansas, California, western Venezuela, and Morocco.

This is evidenced by the Ghawar supergiant oil field (Saudi Arabia); the Panhandle Field in Kansas (United States), which also produces helium; the Tengiz Field (Kazakhstan); the White Tiger Field (Vietnam); and innumerable others. The Lost Soldier Field in Wyoming has <b>oil</b> <b>pools,</b> he stated, at every horizon of the geological section, from the Cambrian sandstone overlying the basement to the upper Cretaceous deposits.
