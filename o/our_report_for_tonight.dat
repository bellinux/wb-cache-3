5000|$|Every so often, Koppel {{ended the}} program with a [...] "Closing Thought", in which Koppel usually {{expressed}} his opinion {{on the subject of}} the night's broadcast. On his final night, urging viewers to continue watching the program, Koppel concluded his final Nightline broadcast with the following [...] "Closing Thought": There's this quiz I give to some of our young interns when they first arrive at Nightline. I didn't do it with the last batch; it's a little too close to home. [...] "How many of you", I'll ask, [...] "can you tell me anything about Eric Sevareid?" [...] Blank stares. [...] "How about Howard K. Smith or Frank Reynolds?" [...] Not a twitch of recognition. [...] "Chet Huntley? John Chancellor?" [...] Still nothing. [...] "David Brinkley" [...] sometimes causes a hand or two to be raised, and Walter Cronkite may be glad to learn that a lot of young people still have a vague recollection that he once worked in television news.What none of these young men and women in their late teens and early twenties appreciates, until I point it out to them, is that they have just heard the names of seven anchormen or commentators who were once so famous that everyone in the country knew their names. Everybody. Trust me, the transition from one anchor to another is not that big a deal. Cronkite begat Rather, Chancellor begat Brokaw, Reynolds begat Jennings. And each of them did a pretty fair job in his own right. You've always been very nice to me, so give this new anchor team for Nightline a fair break. If you don't, I promise you the network will just put another comedy show in this time slot. Then you'll be sorry. And that's <b>our</b> <b>report</b> <b>for</b> <b>tonight,</b> I'm Ted Koppel in Washington and from all of us here at ABC News, good night.|$|E

40|$|In <b>our</b> <b>report</b> <b>for</b> DG-Research of the European Commission {{entitled}} "Study on {{the economic}} and technical evolution of the scientific publication markets in Europe", published almost two years ago, we showed that, on average, journals published by for-profit publishers are three times more expensive than journals published by not-for-profit publishers. Not-for-profit publishers are, in general, not subsidized, and our results are thus consistent with impediments to effective competition {{on the market for}} scientific publications. Relying on these observations I address two questions sequentially. First, I review the potential, natural and strategic barriers to expansion and entry. Second, scientific associations have large market shares in some scientific disciplines. I discuss the objectives of not-for-profit publishers and study whether they help innovate and drive prices down. Finally, I conclude {{that there is a need}} to promote pro-competitive, i. e. much more flexible, pricing strategies, scrutinize mergers, and refund VAT to research institutions. © 2008 - IOS Press and the authors.
