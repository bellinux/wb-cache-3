5|$|In mid-1944, the Yugoslav Partisans formed two Royal Air Force squadrons, Nos.351 and 352, {{which both}} {{operated}} Hurricane fighter-bombers. No.351 Squadron flew Hurricane Mk IICs during training {{and was later}} equipped with Hurricane Mk IVs, and No.352 briefly flew Hurricane Mk IICs during training before re-equipping with Supermarine Spitfire Mk Vs. Both squadrons operated as part of No. 281 Wing RAF of the Balkan Air Force, conducting ground attack missions in support <b>of</b> <b>Partisan</b> operations {{until the end of}} the war. Hurricanes remained in service with the post-war Yugoslav Air Force until the early 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In outline, the XV Mountain Corps {{plan was}} for a heavy aerial {{bombardment}} <b>of</b> <b>Partisan</b> positions in and around Drvar by Luftwaffe aircraft, followed by a parachute and glider assault by the 500th SS Parachute Battalion who had the task of capturing or killing Tito and destroying his headquarters. The assault also included tasks to capture or destroy the Allied military missions to the Partisans. On the same day, ground elements of XV Mountain Corps were to converge on Drvar to link up with the 500th SS Parachute Battalion. A small reconnaissance aircraft was tasked to fly into Drvar after its capture to retrieve Tito or his body.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} years of the war, Yugoslav Partisans in Croatia did not have support of Croats. The {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>partisans</b> on the territory of Croatia were Croatian Serbs. However, in 1943 Croats started to join partisans in larger numbers. On the territory of the Independent State of Croatia, 75-80% <b>of</b> <b>partisans</b> were ethnic Serbs. In 1943, number <b>of</b> Croat <b>partisans</b> in Croatia increased, so in 1944 they composed 61% <b>of</b> <b>partisans</b> on the territory of Croatia, while Serbs made 28%.|$|R

5|$|Activists {{have played}} a {{significant}} role in MSU history. During the height of the Vietnam War, student protests helped create co-ed residence halls, and blocked the routing of Interstate 496 through campus.

Graduate campus groups include the Graduate Employees Union and the Council of Graduate Students. Michigan State also has a variety <b>of</b> <b>partisan</b> groups ranging from liberal to conservative, including the College Republicans, the College Democrats and several third party organizations. Other partisan activist groups include Young Americans for Freedom and Young Americans for Liberty on the right; Young Democratic Socialists, Students for Economic Justice, Young Communist League and MEChA on the left. Given MSU's proximity to the Michigan state capital of Lansing, many politically inclined Spartans intern for state representatives.|$|E
5|$|Escorted by {{elements}} of the 3rd Krajina Brigade, Tito {{made his way to}} Potoci, where he was met by a battalion of the 1st Proletarian Brigade. At Potoci, they were met by the staff of the Allied military missions. The British mission signals officer had brought the only surviving radio. Initially, Tito had been in favour of continuing the attack on the SS paratroopers, but after reassessing the situation, he cancelled further attacks. As the German intention to encircle the Supreme Command in a small area around Drvar with approaching units, and then destroy it with land forces had become apparent by now, serious reorganisation <b>of</b> <b>Partisan</b> dispositions was now required. After German troops were observed in the area of Potoci, Tito and his companions were escorted towards Kupres.|$|E

5|$|In September, it {{was placed}} {{under the command of}} the newly formed XV Mountain Corps led by Lüters. That month, the {{division}} concluded a collaboration agreement with the 260-strong Chetnik detachment of Mane Rokvić, who was in control of an area which included parts of both western Bosnia and Lika. The division utilised the Chetniks to protect railway lines and key industries in their area, as well as for scouting against the Partisans and attacks on the rear <b>of</b> <b>Partisan</b> formations. Desertions worsened particularly after the capitulation of Italy in early September 1943. For example, during October 1943, 334 men deserted from the division. It handled thousands of Italian prisoners {{in the aftermath of the}} surrender, feeding them and marching them under guard towards the Reich.|$|E
5|$|On a field near Ustikolina and Jahorina {{in eastern}} Bosnia, the Chetniks of Baćović and Ostojić massacred about 2,500 Muslims and burned {{a number of}} villages. Baćović also killed a number <b>of</b> <b>Partisan</b> sympathizers elsewhere. In September 1942, Baćović {{completed}} a tour of Chetnik units in Herzegovina, and reported that {{the morale of the}} population was excellent and that the actions of the Ustaše and Partisans were drawing the populace to the Chetniks. That same month, his Chetniks killed 900 Croats in the coastal town of Makarska. Baćović's reports made it plain that his forces were conducting planned operations to kill or drive out the Muslim and Catholic population of Herzegovina. One of these reports stated that during reprisal attacks against the towns of Ljubuški in western Herzegovina and Imotski in the Dalmatian hinterland, his Chetniks had skinned alive three Catholic priests, killed all men over fifteen, and razed 17 villages.|$|E
5|$|Stojanović left Grmeč {{and went}} to Skender Vakuf in {{northwest}} central Bosnia {{to participate in the}} first regional conference of the KPJ in Bosanska Krajina, which was held from 21 to 23February 1942. In the Partisan territorial structure, the military-political region of Bosanska Krajina included central Bosnia. At the Skender Vakuf conference, presided over by Pucar, Stojanović and Karabegović, the participants analysed the military and political situation in the region. The increase of Chetnik influencewhich was strongest in southeastern Bosanska Krajina and northwest central Bosnia in the zones of responsibility of the 3rd and 4th Krajina Detachmentswas a big problem for the KPJ. A number of Partisans of these detachments joined the Chetnik side. Only in Kozara had Chetnik influence been held at bay. At the conference, Stojanović was appointed to lead a unified command <b>of</b> <b>Partisan</b> forces in Bosanska Krajina, but on 24February he was replaced with Kosta Nađ. The unified command was named the Operational Headquarters for Bosanska Krajina, and Stojanović became its chief of staff and deputy commander.|$|E

5|$|Three organisations {{attempted}} {{to determine the}} location of Tito's headquarters and the disposition <b>of</b> <b>Partisan</b> forces in Drvar. The first of these was the Benesch Special Unit of Section II of the Abwehr (the Wehrmacht intelligence service), some members {{of which had been}} involved in identifying Tito's presence in the town of Jajce prior to the German offensive to retake the town. The Benesch Special Unit was part of the Brandenburg Division, and was staffed by ethnic Germans who spoke local languages. The unit had many contacts with both the Chetniks and Ustaše Militia, and had been tracking Tito since October 1943. Leutnant Kirchner of that unit had been responsible for locating Tito prior to the re-capture of Jajce, and he established a patrol base near Bosansko Grahovo. He got very close to the Drvar cave, and located the Allied military missions, but despite German radio intercepts confirming that Drvar was the site of Tito's headquarters, Kirchner was unable to pinpoint the cave as the location of the headquarters. Kirchner was attached to the 500th SS Parachute Battalion for the operation.|$|E
5|$|Two stallions, named Odin and Mazarin, {{had a large}} {{influence}} {{on the development of}} the Dole breed. Odin (son <b>of</b> <b>Partisan),</b> was a stallion of Thoroughbred (some sources say Norfolk Trotter) breeding, imported to Norway in 1834. Odin was said to cost ₤257 at the time and to have been bred to over 100 mares in his first four years in Norway. All Dole Trotter horses today contain Odin bloodlines. Mazarin was an Arabian imported to Norway in 1934. In 1849, another influential stallion was foaled, named Veikle Balder 4; he was a grandson of Odin and is considered the foundation stallion of the heavier Dole type. A stallion named Brimen 825 was used by breeders to maintain and improve some horses of the heavier Dole type for draft uses.|$|E
