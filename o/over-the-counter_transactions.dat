Some financial transactions are indeed likely to do more harm than good, especially when they contribute to the systemic risk of the financial system. However, such a financial transaction tax should be very small, much smaller than the negative externalities in question, because it is a blunt instrument that also drives out socially useful transactions. There is a case for taxing <b>over-the-counter</b> derivative <b>transactions</b> at a somewhat higher rate than exchange-based derivative transactions.

40|$|This paper {{combines}} {{the idea that}} securities should be information insensitive {{in order to be}} liquid, with the idea that an infrastructure which performs clearing of trades, and offers additional services to the counterparties, facilitates securities to be liquid. In a recent paper, Gorton et al. [3] argue that securities that serve as a transaction medium should be the least information-sensitive, and derive sufficient conditions for such security to be debt. Also, a few recent papers 1 emphasize the role of a Central Counterparty (CCP) in internalizing externalities that stem from the opacity of <b>over-the-counter</b> (OTC) <b>transactions</b> and the role of a CCP in providing the participants with insurance and cost effective clearing services. This paper focuses on the latter role: it develops a framework very similar to Gorton et al. [3], modified to analyze some of the functions that a CCP performs. It shows that for any type of security, regardless of whether it is debt or equity, clearing transactions through a CCP reduces the extent to which securities are information-sensitive. Two functions of a CCP are key: multilateral netting and the provision of insurance through a default fund. B...|$|R

40|$|The credit {{valuation}} adjustment (CVA) on an <b>over-the-counter</b> derivative <b>transaction</b> is {{the price}} of the risk associated with the potential default of the counterparties to the trade. This dissertation provides an introduction to the concept of CVA, beginning with the required backdrop of counterparty risk and the basics of default risk modelling. Right and wrong way risks are central themes of the dissertation. A model for the pricing of both the unilateral and the bilateral CVA on a credit default swap (CDS) is implemented. Each step of this process is explained thoroughly. Results are reported and discussed for a range of parameters. The trends observed in the CDS CVA numbers produced by the model are all justified and the right and wrong way nature of the exposures captured. In addition, the convergence and stability of the numerical schemes utilised are shown to be appropriate. A case study, in which the model is applied to a set of market scenarios, concludes the dissertation. Since the field is far from established, a number of areas are suggested for further research.

50|$|Internationally, gold is traded {{primarily}} via <b>over-the-counter</b> (OTC) <b>transactions</b> {{with limited}} amounts {{trading on the}} New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM). These forward contracts are known as gold futures contracts. Spot gold is traded for settlement two business days following the trade date, with a business day defined as a day when both the New York and London markets are open for business. Unlike many commodity markets, the forward market for gold is driven by spot prices and interest rate differentials, similar to foreign exchange markets, rather than underlying supply and demand dynamics. This is because gold, like currencies, is borrowed and lent by central banks and in the interbank market. Interest rates for gold tend to be lower than US domestic interest rates. This encourages gold borrowings so that central banks can earn interest on their large gold holdings. Except in special circumstances the gold market tends to be in positive contango, i.e. the forward price of gold {{is higher than the}} spot price. Historically this has made it an attractive market for forward sales by gold producers and contributed to an active and relatively liquid derivatives market.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} impact of central {{clearing}} of <b>over-the-counter</b> (OTC) <b>transactions</b> on counterparty exposures in a market with OTC transactions across several asset classes with heterogeneous characteristics. The impact of introducing a central counterparty (CCP) on expected interdealer exposure {{is determined by the}} tradeoff between multilateral netting across dealers on one hand and bilateral netting across asset classes on the other hand. We find this tradeoff to be sensitive to assumptions on heterogeneity of asset classes in terms of `riskyness' of the asset class as well as correlation of exposures across asset classes. In particular, while an analysis assuming independent, homogeneous exposures suggests that central clearing is efficient only if one has an unrealistically high number of participants, the opposite conclusion is reached if differences in riskyness and correlation across asset classes are realistically taken into account. We argue that empirically plausible specifications of model parameters lead to the conclusion that central clearing does reduce interdealer exposures: the gain from multilateral netting in a CCP overweighs the loss of netting across asset classes in bilateral netting agreements. When a CCP exists for interest rate derivatives, adding a CCP for credit derivatives is shown to decrease overall exposures. These findings are shown to be robust to the statistical assumptions of the model as well as the choice of risk measure used to quantify exposures...|$|R

This thesis addresses three research questions. The first research question is why <b>transactions</b> of <b>over-the-counter</b> derivatives are prone to "mis-selling" practices. The thesis explains that the vulnerability of over-the-counter derivatives to "mis-selling" is caused by dependence of consumers on financial institutions due to asymmetric information and knowledge, high profitability of selling over-the-counter derivatives and the expanding products and consumer base of over-the-counter derivatives. The second question is how social institutions such as statutory regulation and private law have dealt with "mis-selling" of over-the-counter derivatives. The thesis shows that statutory regulation demands that financial institutions assume fiduciary duties which cannot be denied or modified by contracts while private law sees an <b>over-the-counter</b> derivative <b>transaction</b> as {{just one of the}} commercial contracts between equal counterparties. It also explains the difference of the two institutions in testing causality between breach of standards and loss. The third research question is how to achieve harmonized interplay between private law and statutory regulation in regulating "mis-selling" of over-the-counter derivatives. The thesis proposes two legal reforms; the statutory "right of action" for breach of regulatory requirements should be extended to all consumers except for financial institutions; the causation test in private law should be relaxed to the 'significance' test...|$|R

This presentation focuses on how landfills {{are participating in}} voluntary carbon and renewable energy markets, and presents case studies from award-winning projects that utilize these funding mechanisms. Landfills participate in the voluntary carbon markets using one of two main mechanisms: on an exchange or through an <b>over-the-counter</b> (OTC) <b>transaction.</b> An exchange, such as the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX), is likely the most well known mechanism. At present, CCX has 35 registered landfill methane offset project providers in the United States [1]. As of April 2008, landfill methane projects comprised approximately 9 {{percent of all the}} carbon credits issued by CCX. OTC transactions are private between the seller, buyer, and/or broker involved in the transaction. Despite their private nature, the volume of OTC traded emissions has substantially grown in recent years according to research from Ecosystem Marketplace [2]. Recent data from Point Carbon indicate that 132 U. S. landfills have either made a transaction in the carbon market, or {{are in the process of}} developing, producing, certifying, or verifying their emissions reductions in order to prepare for an OTC transaction or exchange on the CCX [3]. In addition to carbon finance, LFGE projects generating electricity are also selling Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs).

Stakeholders are also using state and federal financial incentives to promote LFGE projects.

40|$|SUMMARY RECOMMENDATIONS 1. One of {{the major}} lessons from the current {{financial}} crisis refers to the systemic dimension of financial risk which had been almost completely neglected by bankers and supervisors in the pre- 2007 years. 2. Accordingly, the most needed change in financial regulation, {{in order to avoid}} a repetition of such a crisis in the future, consists of influencing individual bank behaviour such that systemic risk is decreased. This objective is new and distinct from what Basle II was intended to achieve. 3. It is important, therefore, to evaluate proposed new regulatory instruments on the ground of whether or not they contribute to a reduction, or containment of systemic risk. We see two new regulatory measures of paramount importance: the introduction of a Systemic Risk Charge (SRC), and the implementation of a transparent bank resolution regime. Both measures complement each other, thus both have to be realized to be effective. 4. We propose a Systemic Risk Charge (SRC), a levy capturing the contribution of any individual bank to the overall systemic risk which is distinct from the institution’s own default risk. The SRC is set up such that the more systemic risk a bank contributes, the higher is the cost it has to bear. Therefore, the SRC serves to internalize the cost of systemic risk which, up to now, was borne by the taxpayer. 5. Major details of our SRC refer to the use of debt that may be converted into equity when systemic risk threatens the stability of the banking system. Also, the SRC raises some revenues for government. 6. The SRC has to be compared to several bank levies currently debated. The Financial Transaction Tax (FTT) does not directly address systemic risk and is therefore inferior to a SRC. Nevertheless, a FTT may offer the opportunity to subsidize on-exchange trading at the expense of off-exchange (<b>over-the-counter,</b> OTC) <b>transactions,</b> thereby enhancing financial market stability. The Financial Activity Tax (FAT) is similar to a VAT on financial services. It is the least adequate instrument among all instruments discussed above to limit systemic risk. 7. Bank resolution regime: No instrument to contain systemic risk can be effective unless the restructuring of bank debt, and the ensuing loss given default to creditors, is a real possibility. As the crisis has taught, bank restructuring is very difficult in light of contagion risk between major banks. We therefore need a regulatory procedure that allows winding down banks, even large banks, on short notice. Among other things, the procedure will require to distinguish systemically relevant exposures from those that are irrelevant. Only the former will be saved with government money, and it will then be the task of the supervisor to ensure a sufficient amount of nonsystemically relevant debt on the balance sheet of all banks. 8. Further issues discussed in this policy paper and its appendices refer to the necessity of a global level playing field, or the lack thereof, for these new regulatory measures; the convergence of our SRC proposal with what is expected to be long-term outcome of Basle III discussions; as well as the role of global imbalances...|$|R
40|$|Introduction A {{revised version}} of this paper has been {{released}} in July 2009. The origins of BIS activities in the field of international financial statistics go back to the mid- 1960 s and the emergence of the so-called eurocurrency markets that had sprung up to circumvent domestic regulations. At that time the key policy concern that gave rise to the joint data collection exercise by the central banks of the G 10 countries {{under the aegis of the}} BIS was the need to monitor the rapid growth of these markets and its possible monetary implications. This led to the introduction of reporting by internationally active banks of their international positions in major individual currencies, with a geographical and partial sectoral breakdown. On the basis of these reports the central banks and the BIS compiled the so-called locational banking statistics for various lending and borrowing countries. In the subsequent years, the issue of recycling the current account surpluses of oil-producing countries shifted the emphasis in favour of a more detailed geographical breakdown and of flow data. In the context of the deregulation of domestic financial systems and capital flows in the 1970 s and 1980 s these concerns abated, but in their place came others, notably the rise in the indebtedness of many developing countries to international banks in the early 1980 s. This build-up was visible in the existing locational banking statistics collected and published by the BIS, but it was not possible to evaluate in a comprehensive way the risk characteristics of the exposures of national banking systems to individual borrowing countries. The need for such information therefore led to the reporting of a second set of international banking data on a fully consolidated basis. A maturity breakdown of the consolidated banking claims was also introduced at that time. In response to calls for more up-to-date information on the international lending activities of banks, the BIS began in the early 1990 s to collect and publish data on signed syndicated credit facilities. More recently, with the objective of enhancing the analysis of country risk exposures, efforts have been made to achieve a more complete and detailed reporting of consolidated banking data on an ultimate risk basis, including off-balance sheet positions relating to bank's derivatives transactions. As a result of the increasing role of the international securities markets in global financial intermediation, the BIS was mandated in the mid- 1980 s to collect and publish statistics on these markets on the basis of data from commercial databases and information available to individual central banks. In the 1990 s the BIS also became increasingly involved in the coordination of joint surveys that central banks carried out on a regular basis to monitor activity in global foreign exchange markets. Moreover, as derivatives markets expanded in the wake of financial innovation, central banks asked the BIS to collect and publish international data on exchange-traded and <b>over-the-counter</b> derivatives <b>transactions.</b> The development of the BIS international financial statistics thus reflects evolving central bank concerns relating to monetary and financial stability in the context of worldwide financial market deregulation, innovation and globalisation. In addition to their use for policy-related monitoring purposes by central banks, the international financial statistics have meanwhile proved to be of interest to private sector market participants. The latter have come to recognise the unique value of the BIS data for tracking the borrowing by emerging market countries from the international banking and securities markets. The BIS data are also used by the IMF in the compilation of its international financial statistics and in its surveillance of individual economies. Moreover, the BIS data have proved to be useful for improving balance of payment statistics and for measuring and monitoring developing countries' foreign debt. With respect to the latter, following the 1997 Asian debt crisis the IMF, OECD, World Bank and BIS pooled their respective statistics to collectively publish data from creditor and market sources on countries' foreign indebtedness. Apart from providing insights into the geographical distributions of international financial flows and external vulnerabilities and risk exposures of debtors and creditors, the international financial statistics collected and disseminated by the BIS contain important information on the structural developments in international financial markets. They can be used, for instance, to analyse the importance of individual financial centres (including so-called offshore centres), the emergence of new relationships between financial and non-financial firms, the level and concentration of activity in financial markets as well as spillovers between different market segments. Much of this is not easily available elsewhere. The statistics become even more valuable when they are combined with other sources covering financial asset prices, market liquidity and trading patterns, external ratings, and the activity of non-bank financial firms and non-financial companies. They then allow market participants and policymakers to make an assessment of credit and liquidity risks in domestic and international financial markets as well as of potential vulnerabilities to systemic disturbances in these markets. The usefulness of the international financial statistics is, of course, potentially affected by the fact that the boundaries between international and domestic markets are becoming more blurred. This could, on the one hand, constitute a weakness of the statistics as it may become increasingly difficult to define and distinguish pure international financial market activity from that in domestic markets. On the other hand, as this guide explains and illustrates, the methodology of the international statistics has tried to keep pace with such developments and to ensure that financial analysts are aware of the limitations of the statistics. Moreover, given that financial innovations have often started in the competitive environment of the international financial markets and that market sentiments are becoming increasingly correlated internationally, the BIS statistics have been and continue to be a very useful tool to capture structural and market developments in global markets at an early stage. The BIS, and the central banking community working through it, have also taken steps to complement the publication of the international financial statistics with a selection of highlights and analyses of major market trends. In the case of the BIS this applies to the press releases accompanying the release of new data; to the BIS Quarterly Review, which contains more in-depth analysis of specific issues, and to its Annual Report, which analyses long-term trends and emerging policy issues. The statistics are also mentioned and explained regularly in presentations by senior BIS officials to central banks, market participants and academics. Other initiatives to promote the use of the statistics include making them available in electronic form on the BIS website and updating the guidelines and methodological notes on a regular basis. Work on collecting, compiling and disseminating the BIS international financial statistics is closely related to, and guided by, the activities of the various Basel-based committees and expert groups as well as those of other international institutions. The Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) plays a key role in reaching a consensus on priorities to improve the BIS statistics. With respect to international banking data, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) is consulted on methodological issues to help ensure the collection of adequate statistical information from internationally active banks on risk exposures. The Financial Stability Forum (FSF) has also formulated a number of recommendations to enhance statistics on international financial markets and capital flows that are taken into account by the BIS in its statistical work. As a result of the strong support of these groups it has been possible to improve on the reporting frequency and timeliness of the international financial statistics in recent years. One of the major underlying objectives of the various Basel-based groups is to strengthen financial stability through transparency and market discipline. Increased public disclosure plays a key role in this and should, over time, lead to better quantitative and qualitative information on the activities and risk profiles of individual institutions as well as market infrastructures such as payment, settlement and trading systems. With respect to the functioning of domestic and international financial markets, various proposals have been made to complement the BIS statistics on banking, securities, foreign exchange and derivatives markets over time by improved aggregate information on liquidity, leverage and position-taking in these markets. More recently the IMF has been elaborating a methodology for the collection by individual countries of comprehensive financial soundness indicators, which should complement the BIS statistics. The disclosure framework on the exposures and capital structure of internationally active banks proposed under the New Basel Capital Accord (its so-called Pillar III) should contribute to better balance sheet data of individual internationally active banks. This Guide is structured around the three main areas of the BIS international financial statistics: the international banking statistics (Part II); the securities statistics (Part III); and the derivatives and foreign exchange statistics (Parts IV and V). It also provides a description of the joint BIS-IMF-OECD-World Bank statistics on external debt for which the BIS is a main contributor of data (Part VI). The guide provides a detailed description of the sources, compilation, transformation and publication of the data. Two separate chapters on the quality and the uses of the statistics (Parts VII and VIII) follow the description of the statistics. A more detailed description of the BIS international banking statistics and their underlying methodology is provided in a separate guide. This Guide has been prepared by Paul Van den Bergh, Rainer Widera, Karsten von Kleist, Jesper Wormstrup and others in the Monetary and Economic Department of the BIS. Chapter VIII draws largely on an article by Philip Wooldridge. ...|$|R
