40|$|AbstractThe lateral eyes of Crustacea and Insecta {{consist of}} many single <b>optical</b> <b>units,</b> the ommatidia, that are {{composed}} of a small, strictly determined and evolutionarily conserved set of cells. In contrast, the eyes of Myriapoda (millipedes and centipedes) are fields of <b>optical</b> <b>units,</b> the lateral ocelli, {{each of which is}} composed of up to several hundreds of cells. For many years these striking differences between the lateral eyes of Crustacea/Insecta versus Myriapoda have puzzled evolutionary biologists, as the Myriapoda are traditionally considered to be closely related to the Insecta. The prevailing hypothesis to explain this paradox has been that the myriapod fields of lateral ocelli derive from insect compound eyes by disintegration of the latter into single ommatidia and subsequent fusion of several ommatidia to form multicellular ocelli. To provide a fresh view on this problem, we counted and mapped the arrangement of ocelli during postembryonic development of a diplopod. Furthermore, the arrangement of proliferating cells in the eyes of another diplopod and two chilopods was monitored by labelling with the mitosis marker bromodeoxyuridine. Our results confirm that during eye growth in Myriapoda new elements are added {{to the side of the}} eye field, which extend the rows of earlier-generated <b>optical</b> <b>units.</b> This pattern closely resembles that in horseshoe crabs (Chelicerata) and Trilobita. We conclude that the trilobite, xiphosuran, diplopod and chilopod mechanism of eye growth represents the ancestral euarthropod mode of visual-system formation, which raises the possibility that the eyes of Diplopoda and Chilopoda may not be secondarily reconstructed insect eyes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the question of}} an <b>optical</b> <b>unit</b> designing for transmitting power laser radiation through an optical fiber. The aim of this work is designing a simple construction unit with minimized reflection losses. The source of radiation in the <b>optical</b> <b>unit</b> described below is an ultraviolet laser with diode pumping. We present the general functioning scheme and designing features for the three main parts: laser beam deflecting system, laser beam dump and <b>optical</b> <b>unit</b> control system. The described laser beam deflection system is composed of a moving flat mirror and a spherical scattering mirror. Comparative analysis of the production technology for such mirrors was carried out, and, as a result, {{the decision was made}} to produce both mirrors of 99. 99 % pure molybdenum without coating. A moving mirror deflects laser emission from a source through a fiber or deflects it on a spherical mirror and into the laser beam dump, moreover, switching from one position to another occurs almost immediately. It is shown that a scattering mirror is necessary, otherwise, the absorbing surface of the beam dump is being worn out irregularly. The laser beam dump is an open conical cavity, in which the conical element with its spire turned to the emission source is placed. Special microgeometry of the internal surface of the beam dump is suggested for the better absorption effect. An <b>optical</b> <b>unit</b> control system consists of a laser beam deflection system, laser temperature sensor, deflection system solenoid temperature sensor, and deflection mirror position sensor. The signal processing algorithm for signals coming from the sensors to the controller is described. The <b>optical</b> <b>unit</b> will be used in special technological equipment...|$|E

40|$|With the {{development}} of space and aviation industry, the optical systems with high resolution and better imaging quality are required. According to the alignment technical process, the factors of every step which have big influence to the imaging quality are analyzed. It is detected that the micro-stress assembly of the <b>optical</b> <b>unit</b> and the high co-axial precision of the entire optical system are the two important factors which are supposed to determine how well the imaging quality of the optical system is; also the technical methods are discussed to ensure these two factors from the engineering view. The reflective interference testing method to measure the surface figure and the transitive interference testing method to measure the wave aberration of the <b>optical</b> <b>unit</b> are combined to ensure the micro-stress assembly of the <b>optical</b> <b>unit,</b> so it will not bring astigmatism to the whole system imaging quality.
