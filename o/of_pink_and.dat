The Dining Room, Drawing Room and Ante Room, which overlook the northern bastion, date from the 1730s, when the Duke of Dorset constructed them to form a private set of chambers. These rooms feature a range <b>of</b> <b>pink</b> <b>and</b> purple window glass, which tradition says was installed by the Earl of Liverpool to protect his wife's eyesight; recent analysis shows {{that some of the}} pink-tinted glass dates from the 1730s, and discoloured naturally over time, while other panes were intentionally purchased around 1800 in these hues, but probably as status symbols and not for any medical purpose.|$|E

25|$|Pinot gris, Pinot grigio or Grauburgunder is a {{white wine}} grape variety of the species Vitis vinifera. Thought to be a mutant clone of the Pinot noir variety, it {{normally}} has a grayish-blue fruit, accounting for its name but the grapes can have a brownish pink to black and even white appearance. The word pinot supposedly could {{have been given to}} it because the grapes grow in small pine cone-shaped clusters. The wines produced from this grape also vary in color from a deep golden yellow to copper and even a light shade <b>of</b> <b>pink,</b> <b>and</b> {{it is one of the}} more popular grapes for skin-contact wine.|$|E

25|$|The maximum shell {{length of}} this species is up to 12cm, but it more {{commonly}} grows up to about 9cm. The shell of Haliotis asinina has a distinctly elongated contour, in clear resemblance to a donkey ear, hence the common name. Its outer surface is smooth and almost totally covered by the mantle in life, making encrustations of other animals (such as barnacles) quite uncommon in comparison to other abalones. The shell of H. asinina presents 5 to 7 ovate open holes {{on the left side}} of the body whorl. These holes collectively make up what is known as the selenizone which form as the shell grows. Its spire is somewhat conspicuous, with a mostly posterior apex. The color may variate between green olive or brown externally, with distinct roughly triangular patches. As is the case in many other abalones, the interior surface of the shell is strongly iridescent, with shades <b>of</b> <b>pink</b> <b>and</b> green.|$|E
25|$|Johnson {{designed}} a two-story portico with five arches that faced east toward the city’s skyline. The arches and their tapered support columns were clad in creamy Texas shellstone. The remaining three {{sides of the}} 20,000-square-foot building were also covered with shellstone cladding. Sheltered by the arched portico, the museum's front wall consisted of a two-story curtain of glass windows with bronze mullions. The main entrance lead directly into a two-story hall adorned with {{the same type of}} shellstone used on the exterior, teak wall coverings, and a floor <b>of</b> <b>pink</b> <b>and</b> gray granite. Beyond the main hall were five small galleries of equal size for the display of art. On the mezzanine level were five similar galleries, each with a balcony that overlooked the main hall. These mezzanine galleries served as library and office spaces. To take advantage of the expanse between the two-story portico and the site’s eastern boundary, Johnson {{designed a}} series of broad steps and terraces extending away from the building, with an expansive sunken, grassy plaza as the centerpiece, pointing toward the city’s center.|$|E

[...] In June 2011, German photographer Philipp Paulus sued Rihanna and her record labels, alleging further copyright violations with regard to a scene in the music video where Rihanna wears an expansive dress and is taped to the wall with a plastic sheet in front of her.

When cut or injured, the fruit bodies ooze a bitter white latex that does not change color upon exposure to air. The variety nordmanensis, in contrast, has latex that changes from white to yellow. Lactarius torminosus can be distinguished from similar species like L.pubescens or L.villosus by differences in morphology and coloration, or by microscopic characteristics like spore shape and size.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the video, Rowland is seen dressed in waist-high trousers, a white blouse, and a black tie. The first scene of the video features Rowland and her love interest, played by Alvino Lewis, arguing. During the song's build-up, she is dressed in a black-and-white netted catsuit, standing in front <b>of</b> <b>pink</b> <b>and</b> red streamers. Just before the chorus, she appears in a low cut corset against a dark backdrop with her hair tied in a tight bun. In the chorus, she appears in a gold dress on a turntable surrounded by smoke, spliced with scenes of the argument and a blue-tinged image of Rowland. As she sings the hook of the song, the camera flicks to a scene where she is surrounded by windswept rose petals (top frame). During the second verse, the blue tinged image of Rowland is seen again, as is a new scene where she is on the turntable again dressed in a black ball gown with frills around the neck and shoulder. This is spliced with more scenes of Rowland in her gold dress. As the chorus builds for a second time, Rowland is seen wearing a tube dress before switching to the dark corset scene where it begins to rain. Rowland is then seen surrounded by white doves (bottom frame) which fly around her while she spins on the circular trap. The bridge of the song focuses on the dark corset scenes where the rain increases and Rowland's facial expressions display deep sadness. Billboard commented on the last scenes: [...] "In the end, Rowland finally takes those 'Rose Colored Glasses' off – the ones that have prevented her from seeing how truly damaging her relationship is – punching through a glass wall before pastel-colored butterflies appear in representation of her breakthrough." [...] The video ends with blue-tinged images, where she sheds a single tear.|$|E

2500|$|The {{appearance}} of the petals and sepals is similar, both are elongated although the petals are slightly more narrow. Flower colors are generally greenish, white or variable shades <b>of</b> <b>pink</b> <b>and</b> the labellum (a special petal attractive to pollinators) can be spotted in pale yellow, light purple or lilac. The labellum is located along the column and trilobed (three lobes). [...] The lateral lobes are small and raised beside the column, although never involving it. The intermediate lobe is much bigger and quite variable between species. They can have either lanceolate or obovate shape, occasionally be fleshy, flat or bending backwards; in some species they have denticulated edges but are smooth in others. Rarely, calli are present, with claws holding them attached {{to the sides of}} the column. The column is short, thick and erect, normally greenish, biauriculated, and bears six pollinia of different sizes, two larger in the center and four smaller in two pairs held by a short caudicle in an arrangement that is unique among orchids.

2500|$|The {{diamonds}} {{produced at}} the Argyle diamond mine are {{of an average}} low quality. Only 5% of mined diamonds are of gem quality, compared to a worldwide average of 20% (Author Janine Roberts contends that the [...] "near-gem" [...] quality rating is subjective and misleading because these diamonds can be cut into gems if desired.); of the remaining 95%, they are about evenly split between classifications of [...] "near gem quality" [...] and industrial grade; 80% of Argyle diamonds are brown, followed by 16% yellow, 2% white, 2% grey, and less than 1% pink and green. Despite the low production volume <b>of</b> <b>pink</b> <b>and</b> red diamonds, the Argyle mine is the only reliable source in the world, producing 90 to 95% of all pink and red diamonds. Most Argyle diamonds are classified as type 1a (see material properties of diamond), and have low levels of nitrogen impurities, their colour resulting instead from structural defects of the crystal lattice. Argyle diamonds tend to fluoresce blue or dull green under ultraviolet light, and blue-white under X-ray radiation. The most common inclusion is unconverted graphite, followed by crystalline inclusions of orange garnet, pyroxene, and olivine.|$|E
