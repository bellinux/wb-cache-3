Methods: The second multinational Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes and Needs (DAWN 2) study cross-sectionally surveyed 2057 family members from 17 countries. Participants completed questions about demographics, diabetes, and psychosocial functioning, including <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> overall and nocturnal hypoglycemia.

Results: Eighty-five percent of family members (n = 1661) were at least occasionally very <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the risk <b>of</b> hypoglycemic events overall. Correlates <b>of</b> <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia included female gender, higher age and lower education in the family member, younger age of the person with diabetes and this person being a parent or another adult (versus spouse or partner), insulin or non-insulin injectable treatment, severe or non-severe hypoglycemia in the past 12 months, and family member recognition <b>of</b> hypoglycemia. Elevated <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia had a significant independent association with increased odds of diabetes-related family arguments and family member frustration in providing helpful support (OR range 1. 60 – 3. 72).

500|$|On 7October 1942, Walters took {{command of}} a new formation, No.1 (Fighter) Wing, at RAAF Station Richmond. Established to boost the air defence {{capability}} of Australia's North-Western Area, the wing comprised three Supermarine Spitfire squadrons that had been transferred from Europe: No.54 Squadron RAF, No.452 Squadron RAAF and No.457 Squadron RAAF. With Wing Commander Clive Caldwell, Australia's top-scoring flying ace of the war, as his wing leader, Walters began deploying aircraft and men to Darwin, Northern Territory, in December, providing a filip for morale in the region. Proudly declaring himself Australia's oldest fighter pilot, Walters was reported as taking every opportunity to join his men in the air. He flew as Caldwell's wingman in No.1 Wing's first major action against the Japanese over Darwin on 2May 1943. [...] Eight Spitfires crashed and several others made forced landings, {{for the destruction of}} one Japanese bomber and five fighters. Walters himself narrowly avoiding being shot down when he warned Caldwell of an attacking enemy fighter, to the detriment of his own safety. After they landed, Caldwell chided his commander, [...] "You silly old so-and-so. You want to look after your own skin instead <b>of</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> someone else's!" [...] On 20June, Walters participated in the wing's most successful combat against the Japanese to that time, personally accounting for one of fourteen raiders claimed by the Spitfires, for the loss of two of their own number. He posted out of Darwin a few days later, having earned the admiration of Caldwell {{and the rest of the}} wing's personnel.|$|E

2500|$|In his 1958 article Tobin {{also led}} the way in showing how to deal with utility {{maximization}} under uncertainty with an infinite number of possible states. As Palda explains [...] "One {{way to get out of}} the mess of figuring out asset prices using a model of maximizing the expected utility of investing in stocks is to make assumptions about either preferences or the probabilities of the different possible states of the world. Nobellist James Tobin (1958) took this line and discovered that in some cases you do not need to worry about the utility of income in thousands of states, and the attached probabilities, to solve the consumer’s choice on how to spread income among states. When preferences contain only a linear and a squared term (a case of diminishing returns) or the probabilities of different stock returns follow a normal distribution (an equation that contains a linear and squared terms as parameters), a simple formulation of a person’s investment choices becomes possible. Under Tobin’s assumptions we can reformulate the person’s decision problem as being one of trading off risk and expected return. Risk, or more precisely the variance of your investment portfolio creates spread in the returns you expect. People are willing to assume more risk only if compensated by a higher level of expected return. One can thus think of a tradeoff people are willing to make between risk and expected return. They invest in risky assets to the point at which their willingness to trade off risk and return is equal to the rate at which they able to trade them off. It is difficult to exaggerate how brilliant is the simplification of the investment problem that flows from these assumptions. Instead <b>of</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> the investor’s optimization problem in potentially millions of possible states of the world, one need only worry about how the investor can trade off risk and return in the stock market." ...|$|E

40|$|To {{understand}} preferred {{sources of}} {{acquired immunodeficiency syndrome}} (AIDS) information and level <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among community college students, a survey of 102 students in an inner-city community college was conducted. The survey requested information on preferred sources of information about AIDS, risk behaviors, and level <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> HIV infection compared with other life risks. Forty-six per cent of respondents had engaged in risk behaviors for AIDS. Of those who were sexually active, 81 % acknowledged not always using a condom. Students noted {{that they were more}} likely to believe AIDS information from a health professional than from a friend, relative, teacher, clergy, or celebrity. Overall, getting AIDS ranked third on a list <b>of</b> life <b>worries,</b> ranking only behind getting bad grades and the death of a family member. For students who identified themselves as black or Latino, however, getting AIDS ranked first on a list of life risks. For those students who reported highrisk behavior for getting HIV, getting AIDS also ranked first on a list <b>of</b> life <b>worries.</b> We conclude that those students at whom messages about risk status have been targeted are most likely to report being more <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> getting AIDS than about other adverse life events.

60|$|Teague and {{the cowboys}} were unleashing {{the rest of}} the pack. It surely was great to see them stretch out, yelping wildly. Like the wind they passed us. Jim and Sampson headed into the woods with deep bays. I was riding Teague's best horse for this sort of work and he {{understood}} the game and plainly enjoyed it. R.C.'s horse ran as fast in the woods as he did in the open. This frightened me, and I yelled to R.C. to be careful. I yelled to deaf ears. That is the first great risk--a rider {{is not going to be}} careful! We were right on top of Jim and Sampson with the pack clamoring mad music just behind. The forest rang. Both horses hurdled logs, sometimes two at once. My old lion chases with Buffalo Jones had made me skillful in dodging branches and snags, and sliding knees back to avoid knocking them against trees. For a mile the forest was comparatively open, and here we had a grand and ringing run. I received two hard knocks, was unseated once, but held on, and I got a stinging crack in the face from a branch. R.C. added several more black-and-blue spots to his already spotted anatomy, and he missed, just by an inch, a solid snag that would have broken him in two. The pack stretched out in wild staccato chorus, the little Airedales literally screeching. Jim got out of our sight and then Sampson. Still it was ever more thrilling to follow by sound rather than sight. They led up a thick, steep slope. Here we got into trouble in the windfalls of timber and the pack drew away from us, up over the mountain. We were half way up when we heard them jump the bear. The forest seemed full of strife and bays and yelps. We heard the dogs go down again to our right, and as we turned we saw Teague and the others strung out along the edge of the park. They got far ahead of us. When we reached the bottom of the slope they were out of sight, but we could hear them yell. The hounds were working around on another slope, from which craggy rocks loomed above the timber. R.C.'s horse lunged across the park and appeared to be running off from mine. I was a little to the right, and when my horse got under way, full speed, we had the bad luck to plunge suddenly into soft ground. He went to his knees, and I sailed out of the saddle fully twenty feet, to alight all spread out and to slide like a plow. I did not seem to be hurt. When I got up my horse was coming and he appeared to be patient with me, but he was in a hurry. Before we got across the wet place R.C. was out of sight. I decided that instead <b>of</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> him I had better think about myself. Once on hard ground my horse fairly charged into the woods and we broke brush and branches as if they had been punk. It was again open forest, then a rocky slope, and then a flat ridge with aisles between the trees. Here I heard the melodious notes of Teague's hunting horn, and following that, the full chorus of the hounds. They had treed the bear. Coming into still more open forest, with rocks here and there, I caught sight of R.C. far ahead, and soon I had glimpses of the other horses, and lastly, while riding full tilt, I spied a big, black, glistening bear high up in a pine a hundred yards or more distant.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} the {{findings on the}} development and validation of a Chinese version <b>of</b> the <b>Worry</b> Scale (WS), a measure <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia. A previously developed 16 -item WS was back-translated and applied to 117 Chinese diabetic patients living in Hong Kong. An iterative process of factor and item analyses identified a unidimensional 10 -item Chinese WS (WS- 10), which accounted for 57. 15 % of the total variance. Cronbach's alpha was 0. 91. Strong correlation was demonstrated between the WS- 10 and WS with 16 items (r = 0. 97, p = 0. 000). Comparing the level <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetic patients established a contrast-group validity of the WS- 10 (p = 0. 002). Criterion validity was established by correlating the WS- 10 with the respondents' glycosylated hemoglobin (r = ? 0. 29, p = 0. 002). Test-retest reliability using intraclass correlation (ICC) was established, ICC(1, 1) = 0. 68. As the clinical administration of this scale takes less than 5 min, the Chinese WS- 10 offers a useful instrument to identify patients with high levels <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia for clinical and education interventions.
