5|$|In 1926 a small {{aeroplane}} {{landed on the}} summit plateau of Helvellyn and took <b>off</b> <b>again.</b> The plane was an Avro 585 Gosport, a two-seater biplane flown by Bert Hinkler, a test pilot who worked for A V Roe, the plane's manufacturers, at Woodford Aerodrome near Manchester.|$|E
5|$|Twentymiles (32.2km) {{north of}} US-412, the highway meets US-60 near Lamont. The two roads share a brief {{concurrency}} before splitting <b>off</b> <b>again.</b> Eightmiles (12.9km) north of this, SH-74 intersects with SH-11 between Deer Creek and Numa, Oklahoma. It {{is at this}} intersection that the designation ends.|$|E
5|$|Captain Glušica {{was given}} {{clearance}} to land, however, he suddenly aborted the attempted landing. The aircraft's throttle handle {{was found in}} the forward position, suggesting that the pilot had attempted to abort the landing and take <b>off</b> <b>again.</b> The co-pilot Ahluwalia had warned his commander three times to go around instead of landing; the first of these warnings had come 2.5 miles before the runway threshold.|$|E
40|$|Statistical {{agencies}} have long recognized the fundamental tension between their mandate to provide high-quality data that informs sound research {{and public policy}} development and their requirement to protect the privacy and confidentiality of their respondents. These dynamics often operate at odds with one another, as demands for richer data products face <b>off</b> <b>agains...</b>|$|R

They reached the play <b>offs</b> <b>again</b> {{in the final}} season in 2012, this time reaching the Southern Final, before losing to the Peterborough Saxons.|$|R
50|$|Following a mid-table {{finish in}} their first season in Conference North, the 2006-07 season saw Workington finish in third place and qualify for the {{promotion}} play-offs where they lost 2-1 against Hinckley United.After two mid table finishes the following seasons, Workington made the play <b>offs</b> <b>again</b> in 2009-10 this time going down 4-1 on aggregate to Alfreton Town in the semi finals.|$|R
5|$|Frigatebirds {{remain in}} the air and do not settle on the ocean. They produce very little oil from their uropygial glands so their {{feathers}} would become sodden if they settled on the surface. In addition, with their long wings relative to body size, they would have great difficulty taking <b>off</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
5|$|Later in the year, she was recommissioned {{and served}} as a {{destroyer}} depot ship at Devonport. By April 1918, Essex was an accommodation ship there. As of 1 December, she was serving as a training ship, but she reverted to her previous role as an accommodation ship by 1 May 1919. Essex was paid <b>off</b> <b>again</b> by October 1919 and was later sold for scrap on 8 November 1921 and broken up in Germany.|$|E
5|$|A mountainside, at the magician's cavern. Goffredo and Eustazio {{are told}} by the Magician that Almirena is being held captive in Armida's palace at the mountain-top. Ignoring the magician's warning that they will need special powers, the pair set off for the palace but are quickly driven back by Armida's monsters. The magician then gives them magic wands that transcend Armida's power, and they set <b>off</b> <b>again.</b> This time they {{overcome}} the monsters, but as they reach {{the gates of the}} palace it disappears, leaving them clinging to a rock {{in the midst of a}} stormy sea. They climb the rock and descend out of sight.|$|E

5|$|Angel {{gives up}} {{his share of}} the gold to Pike in return for sending one crate of rifles and {{ammunition}} to a band of rebels opposed to Mapache. The holdup goes largely as planned until Deke's posse turns up on the train the gang has robbed. The posse chases them to the Mexican border, only to be foiled again as the robbers blow up a trestle spanning the Rio Grande, dumping the entire posse into the river. The pursuers temporarily regroup at a riverside camp and then quickly take <b>off</b> <b>again</b> after the Bunch.|$|E
5|$|Due to insistence by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA), the {{international}} governing body of football, that domestic leagues {{reduce the number}} of games clubs played, the number of clubs was reduced to 20 in 1995 when four teams were relegated from the league and only two teams promoted. On 8 June 2006, FIFA requested that all major European leagues, including Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga be reduced to 18 teams by the start of the 2007–08 season. The Premier League responded by announcing their intention to resist such a reduction. Ultimately, the 2007–08 season kicked <b>off</b> <b>again</b> with 20 teams.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Second Chance round {{became a}} full semifinal, {{taking place in}} a venue {{comparable}} in size to those hosting the others. The expanded Second Chance takes place on a Saturday night, adding an extra week to the event's timetable. The format of voting also changed {{with the introduction of}} a knock-out system. The system pairs the eight songs off against each other, then narrows them down to four before pairing them <b>off</b> <b>again.</b> The winners of the two second round pairings go through to the final. The two finalists do not reprise their songs {{at the end of the}} programme.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, {{the band}} went <b>off</b> silent <b>again</b> after the {{separation}} of Sezar and Sharlatan from the group and due to personal involvements of the now older band members.|$|R

5|$|Just {{under five}} {{seconds after the}} {{undercarriage}} left the ground, the plane's left wing scraped against the asphalt for 110 feet and the stick shaker activated. The crew received six stall warnings, before the jet began banking to the left, then to the right, {{and then to the}} left again, still only several meters above the ground. The aircraft struck two visual approach slope indicator posts, touched down again for approximately 100 feet, before lifting <b>off</b> <b>again</b> and striking an ILS beacon and a water pump house.|$|E
5|$|On 12 December 1964, Barrel Roll was {{approved}} by Souvanna Phouma. The program originally consisted of only two U.S bombing sorties per week that were to be conducted {{by no more than}} four aircraft in each strike. Due {{to the nature of the}} American agreement with the Thai government (most U.S. strike aircraft flew from bases in Thailand), the aircraft had to first fly to South Vietnam, land, and then take <b>off</b> <b>again</b> for Laos. By 24 December, six armed reconnaissance missions were being conducted per day, but the hoped for reaction from Hanoi did not materialize.|$|E
5|$|The {{water was}} turned off at the {{fountain}} from 2001 until 2004, reopening on August 2, 2004. San Francisco estimated the cost of electricity was approximately US$200,000 per year to operate the fountain. Peskin negotiated a public-private partnership where the city {{would pay for the}} operating costs (at a revised estimate of US$76,000 per year) and Boston Properties would pay for maintenance (estimated at US$20,000 per year). The fountain was shut <b>off</b> <b>again</b> during the winter of 2007–08 starting in November 2007 so that skaters at the Justin Herman Plaza ice rink would not be splashed. It reopened on January 21, 2008.|$|E
50|$|On November 29, 2009, Iron Chefs Morimoto and Flay faced <b>off</b> {{one-on-one}} <b>again</b> in Battle Egg Nog. The battle, {{which featured}} ice-carvers, was won by Morimoto {{by a single}} point.|$|R

5|$|Two tramps, named Dusty and Weary, awake {{from their}} slumber in a hay stock and are {{overcome}} with thirst. The two drink from a horse trough and Dusty complains of toothache. The two {{go to the}} dentist office only to be kicked out. When the dentist departs on a cruise the two tramps then pose as dentists and occupy the office and pull teeth with pincers and tongs. When the rightful owners return they drive <b>off</b> <b>again.</b> The tramps continue in their venture and quickly make a large sum of money before they desire their old way of life. The two tramps then surrender the office to its rightful owners.|$|E
5|$|Upon arrival No. 6 Commando took up {{defensive}} {{positions in}} the orange groves alongside troops from the 3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment, the Royal West Kents {{and a number of}} Frenchmen that decided to join their cause. A brief period of lull followed where the commandos were mainly involved in defending the airfield against air attacks from the Luftwaffe, before they moved <b>off</b> <b>again</b> {{to take part in the}} fighting around Medjez-el-Bab, where they fought on the left flank of the first French regular forces to engage the Germans since the fall of France in 1940, forming the spearhead of the advance towards Tunis.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} Wayne Downing in 57 {{seconds on}} 21 June 2008, Woodhouse stated {{his intention to}} retire from football {{at the end of}} the 2008–09 season, to concentrate on his boxing career. He was later appointed as team captain for his final season at the club. Woodhouse scored a decisive penalty in Rushden's opening game of the 2008–09 season, away on 9 August, against newly promoted Eastbourne Borough. He was sent <b>off</b> <b>again</b> in the home game against Histon on 25 August, after receiving two yellow cards. In his eighth boxing match, Woodhouse defeated Jimmy Beech on points on 20 September. He then proceeded to defeat Peter Dunn on 30 November, stopping him 23 seconds in the sixth and final round at Thurcroft's Consort Hotel, Rotherham.|$|E

5|$|After three days' rest, {{they set}} <b>off</b> <b>again,</b> {{searching for the}} trail. Eddy {{eventually}} succumbed to his hunger and ate human flesh, but that was soon gone. They began to take apart their snowshoes to eat the oxhide webbing and discussed killing Luis and Salvador for food, before Eddy warned the two men and they quietly left. Jay Fosdick died during the night, leaving only seven members of the party. Eddy and Mary Graves left to hunt, but when they returned with deer meat, Fosdick's body had already been cut apart for food. After several more days—25 since they had left Truckee Lake—they came across Salvador and Luis, who had not eaten for about nine days and were close to death. William Foster shot the pair, believing that their flesh was the group's last hope of avoiding imminent death from starvation.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} spacecraft, the Gemini Lunar Surface Survival Shelter, {{was designed}} to be sent to the Moon ahead of an Apollo mission. It would have landed close to the planned Apollo landing site, and if the Apollo Lunar Module's ascent stage failed to ignite, the crew would have performed an EVA to transfer to the LSSS. The shelter was not designed to take <b>off</b> <b>again</b> after landing, so an LSRS or another Apollo mission would then be sent to collect the crew, whilst the Command Module Pilot of the original Apollo mission would have returned to Earth alone aboard his spacecraft. It consisted of a Gemini Reentry Module, which would have housed the astronauts whilst they awaited rescue, and a descent stage containing life support systems, consumables, and the engine and propellant used to land the spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Dartnell's {{status as}} a {{professional}} actor was not forgotten. Several newspaper reports after his death postulated whether his VC was the first awarded to an actor, and he is commemorated on a plaque in the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Dartnell Street in Canberra is also named for him, while the German flag he captured at Bukoba is {{in the collection of}} the Royal Fusiliers headquarters in London. In 1981 Dartnell's VC and other medals were sold at a Sotheby's auction to Spink & Son for 24,000. The auction house held the medals for little more than two years before auctioning them <b>off</b> <b>again</b> in 1983 for A$36,000. The buyer donated the set to the Australian War Memorial, where they are displayed in the Hall of Valour.|$|E
