5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. One advertisement claimed, likely in error, that this film {{was based on the}} play The Man <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hour.</b> Written by George Broadhurst, the play focused on political corruption in the form of graft, but the play itself was apparently inspired by politicians of New York. The plot of the film includes a nod to the Women's suffrage movement, {{but it would be a}} decade before the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibited any United States citizen from being denied the right to vote on the basis of sex. The character, Congressman Casey, would later be seen again in Orator, Knight and Cow Charmer. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. There are no known credits for the cast, but Anna Rosemond and Frank H. Crane are two possible actors that were prominent players in 1910. Credits may have included Anna Rosemond, one of two leading ladies of the Thanhouser company in this era. Frank H. Crane was a leading male actor of the company and also involved since the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company. Bowers states that most of the credits are fragmentary for 1910 Thanhouser productions. A surviving film still leaves open the possibility of identifying two characters.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} liturgical reform {{that took place}} since Vatican II in <b>the</b> Liturgy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Syro-Malabar Church <b>of</b> Kerala in India which is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sui iuris Churches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman Catholic Church. This Rite has the East Syrian liturgical {{tradition}} since 6 thcentury. However, this Church had a crucial period of its growth with <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> Latin liturgical tradition from the 16 th century onwards, i. e., after <b>the</b> arrival <b>of</b> Portuguese missionaries in coastal areas <b>of</b> India. <b>The</b> present paper studies <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> revision and translation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Syrian Liturgical Texts into vernacular language since Vatican II and especially traces the revisions and changes in <b>the</b> prayers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Liturgy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hours</b> after <b>the</b> Syro-Malabar Church has received the Major Archiepiscopal status in 1992. In the Syro-Malabar Church, <b>the</b> latest revision <b>of</b> liturgical texts started after <b>the</b> establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Liturgical Research Centre (LRC) at Kakkanad, Kerala in 1993. Though, Vatican II gave <b>the</b> Liturgy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hours</b> <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> official public Church prayer, relatively less attention is given to <b>the</b> revision <b>of</b> this public prayer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church even after the Council. Liturgy celebrates what the Church believes. At this juncture, how far did the call for liturgical renewal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vatican II influence <b>the</b> liturgical revision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> texts in the Eastern rites, especially in the Syro-Malabar rite? What are the conciliar stamps on <b>the</b> hitherto revisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Liturgy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hours</b> in this tradition? Could one find appropriation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> II VC’s principles <b>of</b> revision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liturgical texts by the Syro-Malabar Church in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Liturgy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hours?</b> <b>The</b> paper examines how far <b>the</b> present text <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Liturgy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hours</b> in Syro-Malabar Church is in conformity with <b>the</b> guidelines <b>of</b> II VC. <b>The</b> present paper analyses these questions and provides a documentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> revision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Liturgy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hours</b> since II VC in the Syro-Malabar Rite. status: publishe...|$|R
