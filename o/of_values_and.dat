25|$|The 1st-century poet Manilius {{described}} Jupiter as temperate and benign, and {{the greater}} benefic. It was regarded as warm and moist in nature, and therefore favorable to life.

25|$|The {{most widely}} {{reported}} effect of culture on performance is that strong cultures result in high performance. The three {{reasons for this}} are goal alignment, motivation, and the resulting structure provided. Goal alignment {{is driven by the}} proposed unified voice that drives employees in the same direction. Motivation comes from the strength <b>of</b> <b>values</b> <b>and</b> principles in such a culture. And structure is provided by these same attributes which obviate the need for formal controls that could stifle employees. There are questions that concern researchers about causality and the veracity of the driving voice of a strong culture.|$|E
25|$|These {{developments}} {{led to a}} {{deep understanding}} of basic processes in free-radical polymerisation—the commonest industrial process. For the propagation reaction, Gilbert led an international team that produced a methodology that overcame the long-standing problem of obtaining reliable rate coefficients for this process. He showed that the Arrhenius parameters for different types of monomer take different classes <b>of</b> <b>values,</b> <b>and</b> developed qualitative and quantitative understanding of these classes from fundamental transition-state theory and quantum mechanics. These new methods were based on those that he had developed in his work on unimolecular gas-phase processes. For the termination reaction, his data and models led to the qualitative and quantitative understanding of this process as diffusion-controlled.|$|E
25|$|Thus {{computing}} a p-value {{requires a}} null hypothesis, a test statistic (together with deciding whether the researcher is performing a one-tailed test or a two-tailed test), and data. Even though computing the test statistic on given data may be easy, computing the sampling distribution under the null hypothesis, and then computing its {{cumulative distribution function}} (CDF) is often a difficult problem. Today, this computation is done using statistical software, often via numeric methods (rather than exact formulae), {{but in the early}} and mid 20th century, this was instead done via tables <b>of</b> <b>values,</b> <b>and</b> one interpolated or extrapolated p-values from these discrete values. Rather than using a table of p-values, Fisher instead inverted the CDF, publishing a list of values of the test statistic for given fixed p-values; this corresponds to computing the quantile function (inverse CDF).|$|E

25|$|Several {{scholars}} {{suggest that}} the historical fame and cultural influence of Shankara grew centuries later, particularly during the era of Muslim invasions and consequent devastation of India. Many of Shankara's biographies were created and published in and after 14th century, such as the widely cited Vidyaranya's Śankara-vijaya. Vidyaranya, also known as Madhava, who was the 12th Jagadguru of the Śringeri Śarada Pītham from 1380 to 1386, inspired the re-creation of the Hindu Vijayanagara Empire of South India {{in response to the}} devastation caused by the Islamic Delhi Sultanate. He and his brothers, suggest Paul Hacker and other scholars, wrote about Śankara as well as extensive Advaitic commentaries on Vedas and Dharma. Vidyaranya was a minister in Vijayanagara Empire and enjoyed royal support, and his sponsorship and methodical efforts helped establish Shankara as a rallying symbol <b>of</b> <b>values,</b> <b>and</b> helped spread historical and cultural influence of Shankara's Vedanta philosophies. Vidyaranya also helped establish monasteries (mathas) to expand the cultural influence of Shankara. It may be these circumstances, suggest scholars, that grew and credited Adi Shankara for various Hindu festive traditions such as the Kumbh Mela – one of the world's largest periodic religious pilgrimages.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{discipline}} of anthropology, the term culture represents the customs, values, morals, laws and rituals which a particular group or society shares. In the public imagination, Wall Street represents economics and finance. However, although Wall Street employees may exhibit greedy and self-interested behaviours to the public, these behaviours are justified through their own value system and social practices. Various anthropologists have conducted research on Wall Street and it is their research which can confirm the negative views of Wall Street while providing the public with information that can contribute {{to a better understanding}} of how Wall Street workers perceive themselves. Anthropologist Karen Ho, who has conducted ethnographic research on Wall Street, states in Situating Global Capitalisms that the markets are beginning to self-regulate themselves in terms of neoliberalism. Through the perception of the public, financial investors take on a role that has already been established for them. It is both appropriate and fitting to call Wall Street a culture because of the system <b>of</b> <b>values</b> <b>and</b> practices it holds onto. Moreover, anthropological insight can help improve the general public's understanding of Wall Street and in turn allow the public to appreciate the culture of Wall Street which is both logical and sensible to the workers themselves.|$|E
500|$|Znaniecki {{criticized the}} {{widespread}} definition of sociology as {{the study of}} society. In Znaniecki's culturalist perspective, sociology is a study of culture (though {{it is not the}} study of culture, as Znaniecki recognized that other social sciences also study culture). His definition of sociology has been described as that of [...] "a cultural science whose function is to study systems of social interaction based upon patterns <b>of</b> <b>values</b> <b>and</b> norms of behaviour, through the use of the humanistic coefficient", or more simply, [...] "the investigation of organized, interdependent interaction among human beings." [...] The part of the culture that sociology focused on was that of social relation or interaction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{classical}} labour theory <b>of</b> <b>value</b> generates two well-known contradictions: Ricardo’s {{problem of}} an invariable measure <b>of</b> <b>value</b> <b>and</b> Marx’s transformation problem. I show that both contradictions derive from a category-mistake of supposing that technical costs and total costs {{are of the}} same logical type. This category-mistake is the underlying cause of the almost two hundred year history of the ‘value controversy’. Once identified we can avoid the mistake, which reveals a more general labour theory <b>of</b> <b>value</b> with an invariable measure <b>of</b> <b>value</b> <b>and</b> without a trans-formation problem...|$|R
