The themes of class and sexual repression run through the film, particularly love between classes.|$|E

He argued that all the differences between humans and apes were explained by a combination of the selective pressures that came from our ancestors moving from the trees to the plains, and sexual selection. The debate over human origins, and over the degree of human uniqueness continued well into the 20th century.|$|E

25|$|The {{sessions}} for the album in mid-1958, {{along with the}} Milestones sessions from earlier that year, were seen by many music writers as elemental in Miles Davis' transition from bebop to the modal style of jazz and were viewed as precursors to his best-known work, Kind of Blue. Following audio engineering and digital restoration by engineer Larry Keyes at Sony Music New York Studio, the album was reissued on compact disc in 1991 as part of Columbia's Jazz Masterpieces Series. For later reissues, the album was retitled as 58 Sessions Featuring Stella by Starlight or 58 Miles Featuring Stella by Starlight. The complete 1958 {{sessions for}} Columbia were issued on the box set The Complete Columbia Recordings of Miles Davis with John Coltrane, and Jazz at the Plaza was reissued in 2001.

500|$|In 1958, {{however, the}} arrival of Ornette Coleman on the jazz scene via his fall {{residency}} at the Five Spot club, consolidated by the release of his The Shape of Jazz to Come LP in 1959, muted the initial impact <b>of</b> <b>Kind</b> of Blue, a happenstance that irritated Davis greatly. Though Davis and Coleman both offered alternatives to the rigid rules of bebop, Davis would never reconcile himself to Coleman's free jazz innovations, although he would incorporate musicians amenable to Coleman's ideas with his great quintet of the mid-1960s, and offer {{his own version of}} [...] "free" [...] playing with his jazz fusion outfits in the 1970s. The influence <b>of</b> <b>Kind</b> of Blue did build, and all of the sidemen from the album went on to achieve success on their own. Evans formed his influential jazz trio with bassist Scott LaFaro and drummer Paul Motian; [...] "Cannonball" [...] Adderley fronted popular bands with his brother Nat; Kelly, Chambers and Cobb continued as a touring unit, recording under Kelly's name as well as in support of Coltrane and Wes Montgomery, among others; and Coltrane went on {{to become one of the}} most revered and innovative of all jazz musicians. Even more than Davis, Coltrane took the modal approach and ran with it during his career as a leader in the 1960s, leavening his music with Coleman's ideas as the decade progressed.|$|E
500|$|As was Davis's penchant, {{he called}} for almost no {{rehearsal}} and the musicians had little idea what they were to record. As described in the original liner notes by pianist Bill Evans, Davis had only given the band sketches of scales and melody lines on which to improvise. Once the musicians were assembled, Davis gave brief instructions for each piece and then set to taping the sextet in studio. While the results were impressive with so little preparation, the persistent legend that the entire album was recorded in one pass is untrue. Only [...] "Flamenco Sketches" [...] yielded a complete take on the first try. That take, not the master, was issued in 1997 as a bonus alternate take. The five master takes issued, however, were the only other complete takes; an insert for the ending to [...] "Freddie Freeloader" [...] was recorded, but was not used for release or on the issues <b>of</b> <b>Kind</b> of Blue prior to the 1997 reissue. Pianist Wynton Kelly {{may not have been}} happy to see the man he replaced, Bill Evans, back in his old seat. Perhaps to assuage the pianist's feelings, Davis had Kelly play instead of Evans on the album's most blues-oriented number, [...] "Freddie Freeloader". The live album Miles Davis at Newport 1958 documents this band. However, the Newport Jazz Festival recording on July 3, 1958, reflects the band in its hard bop conception, the presence of Bill Evans only six weeks into his brief tenure in the Davis band notwithstanding, rather than the modal approach <b>of</b> <b>Kind</b> of Blue.|$|E
500|$|Gary Burton, of Berklee College of Music, {{noted the}} {{consistent}} innovation present throughout the album, stating: [...] "It wasn’t just one tune {{that was a}} breakthrough, it was the whole record. When new jazz styles come along, the first few attempts to do it are usually kind of shaky. Early Charlie Parker records were like this. But with Kind of Blue [...] all sound like they’re fully into it." [...] Along with the Dave Brubeck Quartet's Time Out (1959) and Coltrane's Giant Steps (1960), Kind of Blue has often been recommended by music writers as an introductory jazz album, for similar reasons: the music on both records is very melodic, and the relaxed quality of the songs makes the improvisation easy for listeners to follow, without sacrificing artistry or experimentation. Upon {{the release of the}} 50th anniversary collector's edition of the album, a columnist for All About Jazz stated [...] "Kind of Blue heralded the arrival of a revolutionary new American music, a post-bebop modal jazz structured around simple scales and melodic improvisation. Trumpeter/band leader/composer Miles Davis assembled a sextet of legendary players to create a sublime atmospheric masterpiece. Fifty years after its release, Kind of Blue continues to transport listeners to a realm all its own while inspiring musicians to create to new sounds—from acoustic jazz to post-modern ambient—in every genre imaginable." [...] Later in an interview, renowned hip-hop artist and rapper Q-Tip reaffirmed the album's reputation and influence when discussing the significance <b>of</b> <b>Kind</b> of Blue, stating [...] "It's like the Bible—you just have one in your house." [...] The 2014 album Blue by Mostly Other People Do the Killing is a note-for-note reproduction <b>of</b> <b>Kind</b> of Blue.|$|E

Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4.5 out of 5, calling it [...] "superb" [...] and [...] "very atmospheric". Gibron praised Dourif's guest role, and noted that the episode helped to lay the groundwork for the direction the series would take in its second season.

500|$|Originally {{there was}} a scene after the four had been reunited in the museum where Amy had a [...] "meltdown" [...] and Rory assured her it was okay; this was cut due to pacing issues, which pleased Darvill as he disliked his {{performance}} in the scene. Gillan stated that the episode was the [...] "most difficult" [...] for her, as it was [...] "a big climax for Amy and her story that's been building through the series...it just required a lot <b>of</b> <b>kind</b> of concentration and emotion." [...] In August 2011 she stated that the Doctor and Amy's farewell was the most emotional scene for her to film. The scene in which the Doctor gives a final speech to young Amelia was not filmed with Smith and Blackwood on the same set. Smith's dialogue was shot first in the bedroom set, while the corner with the bed was recreated and filmed with Blackwood as a pick-up. Blackwood fell asleep during filming. Amy and Rory's wedding reception was filmed at Miskin Manor. Gillan found wearing the dress strange, while Darvill {{felt as if he}} was gate-crashing someone else's wedding, as he did not know any of the extras there. Haynes wanted to first show the revelation that the TARDIS would appear at the reception in a small way with minor changes such as the glasses tinkling and chandelier shaking, and build it up from there. Moffat thought that Amy would want a big wedding with a lot of dancing. In the script it was written that the Doctor was a [...] "terrible dancer" [...] and danced like a [...] "drunk giraffe", and Smith additionally came up with his own routine.|$|E
500|$|Madhayamaka Buddhism goes even further, finding {{fault with}} the monist view of physicalist philosophies of mind {{as well in}} that these {{generally}} posit matter and energy as the fundamental substance of reality. [...] Nonetheless, this {{does not imply that}} the cartesian dualist view is correct, rather Madhyamaka regards as error any affirming view of a fundamental substance to reality.In denying the independent self-existence of all the phenomena that make up the world of our experience, the Madhyamaka view departs from both the substance dualism of Descartes and the substance monism—namely, physicalism—that is characteristic of modern science. The physicalism propounded by many contemporary scientists seems to assert that the real world is composed of physical things-in-themselves, while all mental phenomena are regarded as mere appearances, devoid of any reality in and of themselves. Much is made of this difference between appearances and reality.Indeed, physicalism or the idea that matter is the only fundamental substance of reality is explicitly rejected by Buddhism.In the Madhyamaka view, mental events are no more or less real than physical events. In terms of our common-sense experience, differences <b>of</b> <b>kind</b> do exist between physical and mental phenomena. While the former commonly have mass, location, velocity, shape, size, and numerous other physical attributes, these are not generally characteristic of mental phenomena. For example, we do not commonly conceive of the feeling of affection for another person as having mass or location. These physical attributes are no more appropriate to other mental events such as sadness, a recalled image from one’s childhood, the visual perception of a rose, or consciousness of any sort. Mental phenomena are, therefore, not regarded as being physical, {{for the simple reason that}} they lack many of the attributes that are uniquely characteristic of physical phenomena. Thus, Buddhism has never adopted the physicalist principle that regards only physical things as real.|$|E
500|$|Aurora is {{a member}} of a trifecta known as the [...] "Golden Era" [...] of Disney heroines. Alongside her two {{predecessors}} Snow White and Cinderella, Aurora is one of the three original Disney princesses. Kit Steinkellner of HelloGiggles wrote that Aurora continued the [...] "trend of passive heroines who wait around for magic to change their lives," [...] a recurring theme shared by Disney princesses who were introduced both during and prior to the 1950s. Sonia Saraiya of Nerve dubbed Aurora [...] "the apex" [...] of [...] "women who made no choices for themselves". Writing for MTV, Lauren Vino felt that the character [...] "followed the basic princess tenants of loving animals and sleeping in makeup", while About.com's David Nusair wrote that Aurora followed the [...] "pattern <b>of</b> <b>kind</b> yet helpless princesses", similar to Snow White and Cinderella. Mary Grace Garis of Bustle observed that the original trio [...] "seek out marriage as both their endgame and salvation", elaborating, [...] "It's literally their own means of escape, and their only final objective." [...] However, Aurora's dreams and fantasies are different {{in the sense that they}} are drawn from loneliness and isolation; the character essentially longs [...] "for human connections beyond her three fairy surrogate mothers." [...] The Walt Disney Family Museum volunteer Lucas O. Seastrom agreed that Aurora is more [...] "self-confident" [...] and [...] "more of repose than the usual naiveté of Disney heroines." [...] Observing that Aurora's actions are influenced by the decisions and opinions of those around her, while most of the film's action involves Prince Phillip, Steinkellner joked that the character is so passive that she remains asleep during the film's climax. Dubbing her [...] "a girl of reaction," [...] nerdology.org's Lisa Kaye Cunningham felt that Aurora's [...] "little screen time makes [...] difficult to classify as a feminist, but her single active decision shows great promise in the evolution of feminist Disney princesses," [...] despite the fact that her agency is constantly undermined by other characters. Cunningham concluded, [...] "By making one active decision to try and follow her dreams, this princess made a big step forward as a stronger feminist than Snow White, though Aurora remains bogged down with passive reactivity." [...] Author Melissa G. Wilson observed in her book Mashups for Teens: From Sleeping Beauty to Beyonce that Aurora's reaction upon learning that she is a princess differs from what one would expect from a young woman.|$|E
