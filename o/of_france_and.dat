5|$|Although still young, Henry was {{increasingly}} gaining {{a reputation as}} an energetic and capable leader. His prestige and power increased further when he unexpectedly married Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1152; Eleanor was the attractive Duchess of Aquitaine and the recently divorced wife of Louis VII <b>of</b> <b>France,</b> <b>and</b> the marriage made Henry the future ruler of a huge swathe of territory across France.|$|E
5|$|Although the Third Crusade, in the end, {{failed to}} retake Jerusalem, a three-year truce was {{eventually}} negotiated with Saladin.

Both sides had become exhausted by the struggle, Richard needed to return to Europe in order to protect his patrimony from the aggression of Philip <b>of</b> <b>France,</b> <b>and</b> Palestine was in a ruinous state.|$|E

5|$|As {{the decade}} progressed, Henry {{increasingly}} wanted {{to resolve the}} question of the inheritance. He decided that he would divide up his empire after his death, with Young Henry receiving England and Normandy, Richard being given the Duchy of Aquitaine, and Geoffrey acquiring Brittany. This would require the consent of Louis as king <b>of</b> <b>France,</b> <b>and</b> accordingly Henry and Louis held fresh peace talks in 1169 at Montmirail. The talks were wide-ranging, culminating with Henry's sons giving homage to Louis for their future inheritances in France, and with Richard being betrothed to Louis's daughter Alice.|$|E
