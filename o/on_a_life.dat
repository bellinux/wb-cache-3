5|$|Centuries after Lisa's death, Mona Lisa {{became the}} world's most famous {{painting}} and took <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> separate from Lisa, the woman. Speculation by scholars and hobbyists made {{the work of}} art a globally recognized icon and an object of commercialization. In 2005, Lisa was definitively identified as the model for the Mona Lisa.|$|E
5|$|In 1827, Mary Shelley was {{party to}} a scheme that enabled her friend Isabel Robinson and Isabel's lover, Mary Diana Dods, who wrote {{under the name}} David Lyndsay, to embark <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> {{together}} in France as man and wife. With the help of Payne, whom she {{kept in the dark}} about the details, Mary Shelley obtained false passports for the couple. In 1828, she fell ill with smallpox while visiting them in Paris. Weeks later she recovered, unscarred but without her youthful beauty.|$|E
5|$|For {{his first}} foreign project, Kurosawa chose a story based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Life</b> {{magazine}} article. The Embassy Pictures action thriller, to be filmed in English and called simply Runaway Train, {{would have been}} his first in color. But the language barrier proved a major problem, and the English version of the screenplay was not even finished by the time filming was to begin in autumn 1966. The shoot, which required snow, was moved to autumn 1967, then canceled in 1968. Almost twenty years later, another foreigner working in Hollywood, Andrei Konchalovsky, would finally make Runaway Train, though from a script totally different from Kurosawa's.|$|E

5|$|Himmler {{joined the}} Nazi Party (NSDAP) in August 1923; his Party number was 14,303. As {{a member of}} Röhm's {{paramilitary}} unit, Himmler {{was involved in the}} Beer Hall Putsch—an unsuccessful attempt by Hitler and the NSDAP to seize power in Munich. This event would set Himmler <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> of politics. He was questioned by the police about his role in the putsch, but was not charged because of insufficient evidence. However, he lost his job, was unable to find employment as an agronomist, and had to move in with his parents in Munich. Frustrated by these failures, he became ever more irritable, aggressive, and opinionated, alienating both friends and family members.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, after {{returning}} from military service in Germany, Banks married his first wife Mollye Ector. He proposed {{to her in a}} letter from Germany. Although he filed for divorce two years later, the couple briefly reconciled in early 1959. By that summer, they agreed on a divorce settlement that would pay $65,000 to Ector in lieu of alimony. Shortly thereafter, Banks eloped with Eloyce Johnson. The couple had twin sons within a year and a daughter four years after that. Ector filed suit against Banks in 1963 for failure to make payments <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> insurance policy agreed upon in their divorce settlement.|$|E
5|$|Shed Light was a crash {{development}} project, and {{was largely}} unguided. It was tasked with {{research and development}} of almost any piece of equipment that might help with the mission outlined in its charter. As a result, few of the programs came to fruition and fewer still left a definitive mark on the conflict. The developments under Shed Light were quickly eclipsed by new aircraft produced under Project Gunship (notably under Gunship II and Gunship III). They were fitted with many of the sensors developed under Shed Light, but took <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> all their own. Shed Light’s most visible programs, Black Spot and Tropic Moon, have largely fallen into obscurity.|$|E

5|$|In 1938, {{a section}} funded by MI6 {{was created for}} propaganda, headed by Sir Campbell Stuart. It was {{allocated}} premises at Electra House and was dubbed Department EH. On 25 September 1939 the unit was mobilised to Woburn Abbey where it joined a subversion team from MI6, known as Section D, and by July these teams {{became a part of}} the newly created Special Operations Executive (SOE). These SOE elements went on to form the core of the Political Warfare Executive in 1941. Their task was to spread false rumours and conduct psychological warfare. Inspired by a demonstration of petroleum warfare, one false rumour stated that the British had a new bomb: dropped from an aircraft, it caused a thin film of volatile liquid to spread over {{the surface of the water}} which it then ignited. Such rumours were credible and rapidly spread. American broadcaster William Shirer recorded large numbers of burns victims in Berlin; though it is not clear what he personally saw, it seems likely his reports were influenced by rumours. The interrogation of a Luftwaffe pilot revealed the existence of such weapons was common knowledge, and documents found after the war showed the German high command were deceived. The rumour seemed to take <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> of its own on both sides leading to persistent stories of a thwarted German invasion, in spite of official British denials. On 15 December 1940, The New York Times ran a story claiming that tens of thousands of German troops had been 'consumed by fire' in two failed invasion attempts.|$|E
