40|$|Cooperative Satellite Communications (SatComs) involve multi-antenna {{satellites}} enabled for {{the joint}} transmission and reception of signals. This joint processing of baseband signals is realized amongst the distinct but interconnected antennas. Advanced signal processing techniques –namely precoding and Multiuser Detection (MUD) – are herein examined in the multibeam satellite context. The aim of this thesis is to establish the prominence of such methods {{in the next generation}} of broadband satellite networks. To this end, two approaches are followed. On one hand, the performance of the well established and theoretically concrete MUD is analysed over the satellite environments. On the other, optimal signal processing designs are developed and evaluated for the forward link. In more detail, the present dissertation begins by introducing the topic of multibeam joint processing. Thus, the most significant practical constraints that hinder the application of advanced interference mitigation techniques in satellite networks are identified and discussed. Prior to presenting the contributions of this work, the multi-antenna joint processing problem is formulated using the generic Multiuser (MU) Multiple InputMultiple Output (MIMO) baseband signal model. This model is also extended to apply in the SatComs context. A detailed presentation of the related work, starting from a generic signal processing perspective and then focusing on the SatComs field, is then given. With this review, the main open research topics are identified. Following the comprehensive literature review, the first contribution of this work, is presented. This involves the performance evaluation of MUD in the Return Link (RL) of multiuser multibeam SatComs systems. Novel, analytical expressions are derived to describe the information theoretic channel capacity as well as the performance of practical receivers over realistic satellite channels. Based on the derived formulas, significant insights for the design of the RL of next generation cooperative satellite systems are provided. In the remaining of this thesis, the focus is set on the Forward Link (FL) of multibeam SatComs, where precoding, combined with aggressive frequency reuse configurations, are proposed to enhance the <b>offered</b> <b>throughput.</b> In this context, the alleviation of practical constraints imposed by the satellite channel is the main research challenge. Focusing on the rigid framing structure of the legacy SatCom standards, the fundamental frame-based precoding problem is examined. Based on the necessity to serve multiple users by a single transmission, the connection of the frame-based precoding and the fundamental signal processing problem of physical layer multigroup multicasting is established. In this framework and to account for the power limitations imposed by a dedicated High Power Amplifier (HPA) per transmit element, a novel solution for multigroup multicasting under Per Anntenna Constraints (PACs) is derived. Therefore, the gains offered by multigroup multicasting in frame-based systems are quantified over an accurate simulation setting. Finally, advanced multicast and interference aware scheduling algorithms are proposed to glean significant gains in the rich multiuser satellite environment. The thesis concludes with the main research findings and the identification of new research challenges, which will pave the way for the deployment of cooperative multibeam satellite systems...|$|E
40|$|Recently, the space-time block codes (STBCs) were {{suggested}} {{to use in}} wireless relaying networks (WRNs), denoted as distributed-STBCs (D-STBCs). This is to exploit effectively the spatial diversity and hence improve the link reliability. In addition, this usage may increase the network’s spectrum efficiency as it allows concurrent transmission from the relaying nodes. However, these networks encounter numerous issues that limit their wide practical use. This thesis addresses three critical issues of WRNs, and proposes solutions for each part individually. In Part I, WRNs are considered under imperfect synchronization. In the literature, most research tends to assume perfect synchronization among the cooperative relays. Unfortunately, this level of synchronization {{is almost impossible to}} achieve in real communication networks, and this introduces a significant performance degradation if imperfect synchronization is present in the network. This part includes mathematical models that are derived for WRNs, either one-way or two-way, under imperfect synchronisation conditions. Unlike existing models, this model provides a simple method of evaluating the problem for variant network configurations. In addition, this model considers the WRNs with N relays, each is equipped with Ra antennas, where N, Ra ∈ N+. With respect to current literature, the contributions of this part are : (1) both the existing PIC and SIC based detectors, which were proposed for specific network configurations instances, are extended here to work with the general model. (2) an enhanced interference cancellation based detector (EIC) is proposed. These proposed detectors shows significant performance improvement compared to the conventional detector under imperfect synchronisation conditions. In addition, the proposed EIC detector provides better improvement due to the designed interference cancellation process. It reduces the reliance on low-performance symbols and it benefits from interference components of currently-detected symbols using a modified maximum likelihood (ML) scheme. Accordingly, an extra performance improvement is achieved, particularly in the first iteration. Part II considers the issue of designing D-STBCs for WRNs with an arbitrary number of relays. It has been shown that the reliability of WRNs increases by adding more relays as a result of more communication paths becoming available. Unlike most existing D-STBCs, this part proposes two high rate coding schemes to accommodate an arbitrary number of relays, while retaining low decoding complexity at the destination. The first scheme, full-rate distributed space-time block coded-joint transmit/receive antenna diversity (D-STBC-JTRD), is proposed for AF WRNs. Its code rate is independent of the number of relays and hence no code rate loss is incurred as the relays number increases. In addition, this scheme deploys the same encoding matrices at every relay; this eliminates the need for additional network overhead to coordinate the code generation by the relays. In other words, {{there is no need to}} interrupt the transmission if a relay has been up/down. The second scheme aims to find a flexible trade-off between reliability and code-rate that can be offered by DF networks. Towards this end, a method to construct a D-STBC that is combined with spatial modulation (SM), denoted as D-STBC-SM, is proposed. This method is not restricted to a specific number of relays and can be constructed as necessary. In addition, a novel adaptive transmission protocol that uses the constructed codes, is proposed to achieve higher space diversity gain, even with relays equipped with a single antenna. Unlike most existing schemes, this protocol offers a throughput that increases as the number of relays increases. Moreover, the <b>offered</b> <b>throughput</b> is achieved using the same total average transmit energy, as only N 0 of the N available participating relays are active at any given time. In Part III, the multi-user interference of WRNs is considered. Two transmission protocols with an interference cancellation scheme are proposed: the concurrentS−R−D-PICR,D protocol for DF WRNs and the concurrentS−R−D-PICD protocol for AF WRNs. Unlike existing protocols, these protocols allow the concurrent transmission in both phases of the transmission. Thus, high spectral efficiency is offered while maintaining low decoding complexity. This low decoding complexity is maintained due to the adaptation of the partial interference cancellation group decoding (PICGD) approach for WRNs, which was initially proposed by Guo, et al., for point-to-point (P 2 P) communication link. For a WRN consisting of J users equipped each with Ja-antenna, a single half duplex (HD) Ra-antenna relay, and M-antenna destination, the concurrentS−R−D-PICR,D protocol achieves the interference-free diversity gain (i. e., Ra × min Ja,M) without imposing any conditions on a node’s antenna number. The interference-free is the diversity gain achieved, assuming that each user in the network is transmitting solely without experiencing any interference from other users, hence it is considered as the natural upper bound of the diversity gain in multi-user WRNs. Similar to most exiting protocols, this protocol requires the CSI of the users-relay links at the relay. In contrast, the concurrentS−R−D-PICR,D protocol achieves a diversity gain of Ja ×M, given that Ra > 8, while the CSI is required only at the destination. Although the diversity’s upper bound is not achieved, this protocol uses a simple relay as no CSI or encoding is required at the relay. In addition, and unlike the existing protocols, the achievable diversity gain is determined by both Ja and M and it is not sacrificed while J is increased. This part also establishes sufficient conditions for an STBC to achieve the prior mentioned diversity gains, when the PICGD approach is employed by multi-users WRNs...|$|E
