5|$|Annually, Manila is {{hit with}} 5 to 7 typhoons {{creating}} floods. In 2009, Typhoon Ketsana (Ondoy) struck the Philippines. In its aftermath, {{the lack of}} infrastructure led {{to one of the}} worst floodings in the Philippines and creating a significant amount <b>of</b> <b>pollution.</b> Following the aftermath of Typhoon Ketsana, the city began to dredge its rivers and improve its drainage network. The Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission is in charge of cleaning up the Pasig River and tributaries for transportation, recreation and tourism purposes. Rehabilitation efforts have resulted in the creation of parks along the riverside, along with stricter pollution controls.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study of pupils' {{knowledge}} and understanding <b>of</b> atmospheric <b>pollution.</b> Specifically, the study is aimed at identifying: 1) {{the extent to which}} pupils conceptualise the term 'air pollution' in a scientifically appropriate way; 2) pupils' knowledge <b>of</b> air <b>pollution</b> sources and air pollutants; and 3) pupils' knowledge <b>of</b> air <b>pollution</b> consequences. The sample consisted of 132 Greek pupils, aged 7 - 13 years. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews during which pupils were asked to provide open responses articulating their views concerning issues related to air <b>pollution.</b> The analysis <b>of</b> the data revealed that children have a concrete and generalised conceptualisation <b>of</b> air <b>pollution</b> and air pollutants. Moreover, they are familiar with the anthropogenic sources <b>of</b> air <b>pollution,</b> with the impacts <b>of</b> air <b>pollution</b> on human health, and with the interdependence of this issue with a variety of environmental aspects.
