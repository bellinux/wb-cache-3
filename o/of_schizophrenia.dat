40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{available}} research associated with childhood onset schizophrenia. Although childhood schizophrenia is a disease uncommonly found in children today, it is present nevertheless and invokes devastating symptoms with children who suffer from it. Because of its complex nature and debilitating symptoms, it is of great concern for many professionals in the mental health arena [...] 111 A comprehensive literature review was conducted to examine the complexities associated with childhood schizophrenia. The study was focused on the following areas: history <b>of</b> childhood <b>schizophrenia,</b> characteristics <b>of</b> childhood <b>schizophrenia,</b> diagnostic criteria <b>of</b> childhood <b>schizophrenia,</b> etiology <b>of</b> childhood <b>schizophrenia,</b> treatment <b>of</b> childhood <b>schizophrenia,</b> and educational implications <b>of</b> childhood <b>schizophrenia.</b> The extensive research concluded that there are still many mysteries left to be uncovered, especially regarding the areas of etiology and treatment.

40|$|The {{schizophrenia}} spectrum {{disorders are}} {{a group of}} psychiatric diagnoses that share several clinical features, typically involving reality distortion. Each is considered a disorder, diagnosed with a distinct set of diagnostic criteria. Spectrum conveys {{the idea that they}} are somehow similar to each other. Such similarity could be defined on purely clinical grounds or at the level of disease mechanism and aetiology. It is this tension of distinctiveness and similarity that makes the scientific study <b>of</b> the <b>schizophrenia</b> spectrum disorders challenging. The concept <b>of</b> the <b>schizophrenia</b> spectrum {{can be traced back to}} Bleuler and his book Dementia Praecox or the Group <b>of</b> <b>Schizophrenias.</b> 1 The schizophrenias are characterised by significant heterogeneity of signs and symptoms, disease course and outcome.

5|$|Many {{psychological}} mechanisms {{have been}} implicated {{in the development and}} maintenance <b>of</b> <b>schizophrenia.</b> Cognitive biases have been identified in those with the diagnosis or those at risk, especially when under stress or in confusing situations. Some cognitive features may reflect global neurocognitive deficits such as memory loss, while others may be related to particular issues and experiences.|$|E
5|$|Psychotic {{symptoms}} may {{be present}} in several other mental disorders, including bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, drug intoxication, and drug-induced psychosis. Delusions ("non-bizarre") are also present in delusional disorder, and social withdrawal in social anxiety disorder, avoidant personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder has symptoms that are similar but less severe than those <b>of</b> <b>schizophrenia.</b> Schizophrenia occurs along with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) considerably more often than {{could be explained by}} chance, although {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish obsessions that occur in OCD from the delusions <b>of</b> <b>schizophrenia.</b> A few people withdrawing from benzodiazepines experience a severe withdrawal syndrome which may last a long time. It can resemble schizophrenia and be misdiagnosed as such.|$|E

5|$|The causes <b>of</b> <b>schizophrenia</b> are {{not well}} understood, but {{numerous}} abnormalities of brain structure have been reported. The most thoroughly investigated alterations involve the cerebral cortex, but effects on the hippocampus have also been described. Many reports have found reductions {{in the size of}} the hippocampus in schizophrenic subjects. The left hippocampus seems to be affected more than the right. The changes noted have largely been accepted to be the result of abnormal development. It is unclear whether hippocampal alterations play any role in causing the psychotic symptoms that are the most important feature <b>of</b> <b>schizophrenia.</b> It has been suggested that on the basis of experimental work using animals, hippocampal dysfunction might produce an alteration of dopamine release in the basal ganglia, thereby indirectly affecting the integration of information in the prefrontal cortex. It has also been suggested that hippocampal dysfunction might account for the disturbances in long-term memory frequently observed.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} psychosocial {{interventions}} {{may be useful}} in the treatment <b>of</b> <b>schizophrenia</b> including: family therapy, assertive community treatment, supported employment, cognitive remediation, skills training, token economic interventions, and psychosocial interventions for substance use and weight management. Family therapy or education, which addresses the whole family system of an individual, may reduce relapses and hospitalizations. Evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in either reducing symptoms or preventing relapse is minimal. Evidence for metacognitive training is mixed with one 2016 review finding benefit and another not. Art or drama therapy have not been well-researched.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the prior}} belief that {{schizophrenia}} occurs at similar rates worldwide, its frequency varies across the world, within countries, {{and at the}} local and neighborhood level. This variation has been estimated to be fivefold. It causes approximately one percent of worldwide disability adjusted life years and resulted in 20,000 deaths in 2010. The rate <b>of</b> <b>schizophrenia</b> varies up to threefold depending on how it is defined.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of the {{heritability}} <b>of</b> <b>schizophrenia</b> {{is around}} 80%, which implies that 80% {{of the individual}} differences in risk to schizophrenia is explained by individual differences in genetics. These estimates vary {{because of the difficulty}} in separating genetic and environmental influences. The greatest single risk factor for developing schizophrenia is having a first-degree relative with the disease (risk is 6.5%); more than 40% of monozygotic twins of those with schizophrenia are also affected. If one parent is affected the risk is about 13% and if both are affected the risk is nearly 50%.|$|E
5|$|Factors such as hypoxia and infection, or {{stress and}} {{malnutrition}} {{in the mother}} during fetal development, {{may result in a}} slight increase in the risk <b>of</b> <b>schizophrenia</b> later in life. People diagnosed with schizophrenia {{are more likely to have}} been born in winter or spring (at least in the northern hemisphere), which may be a result of increased rates of viral exposures in utero. The increased risk is about five to eight percent. Other infections during pregnancy or around the time of birth that may increase the risk include Toxoplasma gondi and Chlamydia.|$|E

Later he worked on psychiatric genetics and genomics. In his Twin Cities MMPI study, part of his Ph.D. thesis, Gottesman found high levels of inheritance in the scales related to schizophrenia, depression, anti-social personality disorder, and social introversion. Genes strongly influenced social introversion and aggressive tendencies. This led to further studies on personality traits of identical twins such as the Minnesota Study of Identical Twins Reared Apart.|$|E

METHODS: The Brief Assessment <b>of</b> Cognition in <b>Schizophrenia</b> {{was administered to}} 116 stable patients with schizophrenia and 58 matched control subjects. To assess concurrent validity, a subset of patients underwent a traditional neuropsychological assessment. RESULTS: The patients with schizophrenia performed significantly worse than the controls (po 0. 001) on all subtests of the Brief Assessment <b>of</b> Cognition in <b>Schizophrenia</b> and on the total score, which attests to the discriminant validity of the test. The global score of the Brief Assessment <b>of</b> Cognition in <b>Schizophrenia</b> was significantly correlated {{with all of the}} subtests and with the global score for the standard battery.

5|$|The primary {{treatment}} <b>of</b> <b>schizophrenia</b> is antipsychotic medications, often {{in combination with}} psychological and social supports. Hospitalization may occur for severe episodes either voluntarily or (if mental health legislation allows it) involuntarily. Long-term hospitalization is uncommon since deinstitutionalization beginning in the 1950s, although it still occurs. Community support services including drop-in centers, visits by members of a community mental health team, supported employment and support groups are common. Some evidence indicates that regular exercise has {{a positive effect on}} the physical and mental health of those with schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|Auditory {{hallucinations}} {{are typical}} of psychoses: third-person hallucinations (i.e. voices talking about the patient) and hearing one's thoughts spoken aloud (gedankenlautwerden or écho de la pensée) are among the Schneiderian first rank symptoms indicative <b>of</b> <b>schizophrenia,</b> whereas second-person hallucinations (voices talking to the patient) threatening or insulting or telling them to commit suicide, may be a feature of psychotic depression or schizophrenia. Visual hallucinations are generally suggestive of organic conditions such as epilepsy, drug intoxication or drug withdrawal. Many of the visual effects of hallucinogenic drugs are more correctly described as visual illusions or visual pseudohallucinations, as they are distortions of sensory experiences, and are not experienced as existing in objective reality. Auditory pseudohallucinations are suggestive of dissociative disorders. Déjà vu, derealization and depersonalization are associated with temporal lobe epilepsy and dissociative disorders.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association {{released}} the fifth {{edition of the}} DSM (DSM-5).

The person had to be suffering from delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. A second symptom could be negative symptoms, or severely disorganized or catatonic behaviour. The definition <b>of</b> <b>schizophrenia</b> remained essentially the same as that specified by the 2000 version of DSM (DSM-IV-TR), but DSM-5 makes a number of changes.|$|E
