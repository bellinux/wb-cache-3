5|$|Large {{trucks and}} buses require a {{commercial}} driver's license (CDL) to operate. Obtaining a CDL requires extra {{education and training}} dealing with the special knowledge requirements and handling characteristics of such a large vehicle. Drivers <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> motor vehicles (CMVs) must adhere to the hours of service, which are regulations governing the driving hours <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> drivers. These and all other rules regarding the safety of interstate commercial driving are issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). The FMCSA is {{a division of the}} United States Department of Transportation (USDOT), which governs all transportation-related industries such as trucking, shipping, railroads, and airlines. Some other issues are handled by another branch of the USDOT, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).|$|E
5|$|While {{attempting}} {{to renew the}} station's license in early 1971, Mid-Atlantic Network ran into trouble with the FCC due to the quantity <b>of</b> <b>commercials</b> the station was airing. The station was carrying 22 minutes <b>of</b> <b>commercials</b> an hour according to a letter from then-FCC Broadcast Bureau Chief Francis R. Welsh. Welsh said in the letter that the FCC was not convinced the amount <b>of</b> <b>commercials</b> served the community in a positive way. At the time, the FCC allowed no more than 18 minutes <b>of</b> <b>commercials</b> per hour. However, the station's license was ultimately renewed on May 14, 1971.|$|R

5|$|When the QIZ program {{came into}} being in 1996, {{observers}} regarded it {{as a vehicle to}} support the development of peaceful relations and normalization <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> ties between Israel and the two Arab states (Jordan and Egypt) with which it had signed peace treaties. In both cases, however, a tenuous peace continues to prevail between Israel and the two Arab states. Since the conclusion of the JordanIsrael peace treaty in October 1994, large numbers of Jordanians, particularly fundamentalists, those of Palestinian origin, and members of the professional unions continue to oppose normalization with Israel and resist the expansion <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> relations. With the establishment of 13 QIZs in Jordan, there has been an increase in the volume of bilateral trade, though the overall totals remain modest.|$|E
5|$|After the Congress of Vienna {{there was}} a degree <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> {{cooperation}} between the various German states resulting {{in the setting of}} the German Customs Union (Zollverein).

This unit was used for inter-state movement of goods, but was not applied in all states for internal use.|$|E

Civilization III encountered development problems followed by a rushed release in 2001. Despite the excitement over Master of Orion III, its release in 2003 was met with criticism for its lack of player control, poor interface, and weak AI.
