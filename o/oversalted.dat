40|$|International audienceThe {{response}} of salt-marsh microphytobenthic communities to daily changes {{is characterized by}} high microalgal growth rates. In comparison, the irregular tidal submersions that prevail in the extreme macrotidal system of "La Baie du Mont-Saint-Michel" (France) could {{be considered as a}} large-scale disturbance. The physiological capacities of microphytobenthic communities along a salinity gradient were assessed for rapid response to osmotic stress, salinity tolerance and changes in response to short time submersion. The photosynthetic system response (Fv/Fm) of microphytobenthic communities sampled at different levels of the saltmarsh along a conductivity gradient was studied during spring-tide and neap-tide periods. All samples demonstrated a dominant adaptation of the microalgal community to coastal seawater salinity, but response heterogeneity ruled out euryhaline adaptation as the global {{response of}} microphytobenthic taxa. The higher and lower salinity tolerances at the seaward and uppermost stations, respectively, were probably due to the occurrence of <b>oversalted</b> or undersalted habitats during the neap tide period. Moreover, the seaward communities were characterized by successive stimulation and inhibition of Fv/Fm during the spring tide period. Such a phenomenon could result from the opposing influences of sea submersion, which supplies resources {{on the one hand and}} destabilizes the biofilm on the other hand. Despite the singular response of these saltmarsh microphytobenthic communities to a conductivity gradient, the rapid and irregular salinity changes due to seawater submersion cannot be considered as a stressor for the dominant taxa...|$|E
50|$|The {{products}} of the fermentation process are usually pale gray to white in color. To obtain the characteristic red or pink color of some bagoong, a kind of food coloring known as angkak is added. Angkak is made from rice inoculated with a species of red mold (Monascus purpureus). High quality salt with little mineral impurities are preferred. High metallic content in the salt used can often result in darker colors to the resulting bagoong and a less agreeable undertaste. Likewise, <b>oversalting</b> and undersalting also has {{a significant impact on}} the rate and quality of fermentation due to their effects on the bacteria involved in the process. Some manufacturers grind the fermented product finely and sell the resulting mixture as fish paste.|$|R

Within days of his arrival at the shop he sacks Annalise, and halves Kristy's (Jodie Haigh) hours. Debbie agrees to help Rick out during the holidays and hits on a winning formula using Helen's recipe for shepherd's pie. Things backfire when Rick and Debbie <b>oversalt</b> the pie leaving it inedible. Rick's management skills worsen when he buys {{a large amount of}} food extender which {{turns out to be a}} waste of money. After adding food dye to liven up the menu and make the food look more attractive, the plan goes awry when Nicholas Greenway (Justin D'Orazio) suffers an seizure. Rick then resigns as manager and returns to school.|$|R
500|$|Salt was {{ubiquitous}} and indispensable {{in medieval}} cooking. Salting and drying {{was the most}} common form of food preservation and meant that fish and meat in particular were often heavily salted. Many medieval recipes specifically warn against <b>oversalting</b> and there were recommendations for soaking certain products in water to get rid of excess salt. Salt was present during more elaborate or expensive meals. The richer the host, and the more prestigious the guest, the more elaborate would be the container in which it was served and the higher the quality and price of the salt. Wealthy guests were seated [...] "", while others sat [...] "below the salt", where salt cellars were made of pewter, precious metals or other fine materials, often intricately decorated. The rank of a diner also decided how finely ground and white the salt was. Salt for cooking, preservation or for use by common people was coarser; sea salt, or [...] "bay salt", in particular, had more impurities, and was described in colors ranging from black to green. Expensive salt, on the other hand, looked like the standard commercial salt common today.|$|R
40|$|The methods {{adopted in}} India for the curing of " Choodai " (Sardinella spp.) {{in places where}} this fish {{constitutes}} {{a major portion of}} the fishery can be broadly classified into the following, viz., sun-drying, dry-salting, wet-salting and pit-curing. A specialised method known as the ' Colombo method of curing' is practised on a commercial scale in some places on the West Coast (Nicholson, 1930). The choice of the method adopted by the fishermen seems to be based more on convenience rather than on convention. When there is heavy fishing the fishermen invariably resort to sun drying and often spread the fish on the sandy beach itself for drying. The product thus obtained will not be wholesome and may contain, besides sand, other materials from the mud. The fish is sometimes washed in sea-water before being spread for drying, but this practice also is not strictly followed anywhere. In the dry salting and wet salting processes also many such unhygienic practices are often met with. Immediately after catch, the fish is mixed with salt without washing and removal of the slimy matter (the quantity of salt being a matter of approximation in places where Government fish-curing yards are not available) and left in some containers until a good market is found for the fish. No strict time limit is followed for the salting process and as such the products can either be under-salted or <b>oversalted.</b> As regards pit-curing it can be considered to be the most unhygienic method practiced in the curing of "Choodai". The fish without washing is mixed with salt, generally in excess, and put in pits lined on the inside with palmyrah leaves, covered with palmyrah leaf mats with earth above and tramped upon to give pressure (Nicholson, 1930). The product obtained is often in a disintegrated form with a viciating smell and mixed with a very high percentage of sand...|$|E
