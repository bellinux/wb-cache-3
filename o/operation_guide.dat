40|$|The {{motivation}} for this thesis {{was the need}} for an inexpensive graphics package {{that could be used to}} support courses in computer graphics and computer vision in the Mathematical and Computer Sciences Department of Atlanta University. The implemented graphics package used a portion of the CORE Graphics System and the hardware used consisted of Zenith Z- 100 micro-computers in the Micro-computer Laboratory of Atlanta University. This graphics system was initially implemented in the Microsoft Pascal programming language. Due to limitations inherent in Pascal, the initial graphics package did not represent the best design practices. The graphics package was converted and expanded using the Ada programming language. The Ada programming language had the ability to satisfy all of the objectives of this project which were: to create a graphics package that was portable, expandable, represented the best software design practices, and able to support computer courses at Atlanta University.

40|$|Simulation of {{electronic}} transport in nanoscale devices plays {{a pivotal role}} in shedding light on underlying physics, and in guiding device-design and optimization. The length scale of the problem and the physical mechanism of device <b>operation</b> <b>guide</b> the choice of formalism. In the sub- 20 nanometer regime, semi-classical approaches start breaking down, thus necessitating a quantum-mechanical treatment of the electronic transport problem. Non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) is a theoretical framework for investigating quantum-mechanical systems - interacting with surroundings through exchange of quasiparticles - far from equilibrium. Although hugely computation-intensive with a realistic device-representation, it provides a rigorous way to include particle-particle interactions and to model phenomena that are inherently quantum-mechanical. We build the Berkeley Quantum Transport Simulator (BQTS) - a massively parallel, generic, NEGF-based numerical simulator - to explore low-power device-design opportunities. Demonstrating scalability and benchmarking results with experimental tunnel diode data, we set out to understand tunneling in devices and to leverage it for both digital and analog applications. Investigating InAs short-channel band-to-band tunneling transistors (TFETs), we show that direct source-to-drain tunneling sets the leakage-floor in such devices, thereby limiting the minimum subthreshold swing (SS) in spite of excellent electrostatics. A heterojunction TFET with a halo doping in the source-channel overlap region is proposed and is shown to achieve steep SS as well as large ON current. We discover that by band-offset engineering, the steepness therein could be controlled primarily by the modulation of heterojunction-barrier. Subsequently, exploring layered materials for analog applications, we demonstrate that doping the drain underlap region in graphene FETs prolongs the onset of tunneling in their output characteristics, and hence significantly increases their output resistance (r 0) and intrinsic gain (g m r 0). Due to large bandgap, and consequently, large r 0, monolayer-MoS 2 FETs exhibit a significant enhancement in maximum oscillation frequency (f max) over their graphene counterparts...|$|E

40|$|Extension of Wilms' tumor {{through the}} {{inferior}} vena cava {{into the heart}} presents a formidable clinical challenge. Excision of such a tumor without provoking emobilization may require cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The completeness of excision {{and the likelihood of}} tumor embolization during <b>operation</b> <b>guide</b> subsequent radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy. To help define these issues, the clinical records of 15 patients enrolled in three National Wilms' Tumor Studies (NWTS) who had intracardiac tumor extension (ICE) were reviewed. The median age at diagnosis was 4 years. One patient had clear cell sarcoma (CCS); the remainder had favorable histologic findings (FH). The clinicopathologic stage was stage II in one patient, stage III in eight patients, and stage IV in six patients. ICE was detected before operation in six patients, during operation in five patients, and after operation in five patients. CPB was used in 10 patients. Eleven patients (73 %) had operative complications, with major intraoperative hemorrhage occurring most often (six patients). Complications occurred less often when ICE was recognized before operation (three of six patients) than when it was not (eight of nine patients). Embolization occurred in only two patients. There were no operative deaths. The patient with CCS died. Eleven of 14 patients with FH survived, with an actuarial event-free, 2 -year survival rate of 86 %. There were no patients in the first NWTS. Of the six patients in the second NWTS (NWTS- 2), four died (67 %). All nine patients in the third NWTS (NWTS- 3) survived, but follow-up was shorter (median 4 years 9 months vs. 2 years 7 months). No particular surgical procedure was associated with an increased death rate. This review suggests Wilms' tumor with ICE presents a formidable surgical undertaking but has a relatively good prognosis. Embolization is an uncommon event in ICE (two patients, 13. 3 %), allowing a planned operative approach. Echocardiography and ultrasonography provide accurate preoperative diagnosis. And ICE should be suspected in patients with extensive vena cava thrombosis or who have hypotension or heart failure during examination or surgery...|$|E
40|$|Given the {{pervasive}} {{nature of information}} technology, the nature of evidence presented in court is now {{less likely to be}} paper-based and in most instances will be in electronic form. However, evidence relating to computer crime is significantly different from that associated with the more ‘traditional’ crimes for which, in contrast to digital forensics, there are well-established standards, procedures and models to which law courts can refer. The key problem is that, unlike some other areas of forensic practice, digital forensic practitioners work {{in a number of different}} environments and existing process models have tended to focus on one particular area, such as law enforcement, and fail to take into account the different needs of those working in other areas such as incident response or ‘commerce’. This thesis makes an original contribution to knowledge in the field of digital forensics by developing a new process model for digital data acquisition that addresses both the practical needs of practitioners working in different areas of the field and the expectation of law courts for a formal description of the process undertaken to acquire digital evidence. The methodology adopted for this research is design science on the basis that it is particularly suited to the task of creating a new process model and an ‘ideal approach’ in the problem domain of digital forensic evidence. The process model employed is the Design Science Research Process (DSRP) (Peffers, Tuunanen, Gengler, Rossi, Hui, Virtanen and Bragge, 2006) that has been widely utilised within information systems research. A review of current process models involving the acquisition of digital data is followed by an assessment of each of the models from a theoretical perspective, by drawing on the work of Carrier and Spafford (2003) 1, and from a legal perspective by reference to the Daubert test 2. The result of the model assessment is that none provide a description of a generic process for the acquisition of digital data, although a few models contain elements that could be considered for adaptation as part of a new model. Following the identification of key elements for a new model (based on the literature review and model assessment) the outcome of the design stage is a three-stage process model called the Advance Data Acquisition Model (ADAM) that comprises of three UML 3 Activity diagrams, overriding Principles and an <b>Operation</b> <b>Guide</b> for each stage. Initial testing of the ADAM (the Demonstration stage from the DSRP) involves a ‘desk check’ using both in-house documentation relating to three digital forensic investigations and four narrative scenarios. The results of this exercise are fed back into the model design stage and alterations made as appropriate. The main testing of the model (the DSRP Evaluation stage) involves independent verification and validation of the ADAM utilising two groups of ‘knowledgeable people’. The first group, the Expert Panel, consists of international ‘subject matter experts’ from the domain of digital forensics. The second group, the Practitioner Panel, consists of peers from around Australia that are digital forensic practitioners and includes a representative from each of the areas of relevance for this research, namely: law enforcement, commerce and incident response. Feedback from the two panels is considered and modifications applied to the ADAM as appropriate. This thesis builds on the work of previous researchers and demonstrates how the UML can be practically applied to produce a generic model of one of the fundamental digital forensic processes, paving the way for future work in this area that could include the creation of models for other activities undertaken by digital forensic practitioners. It also includes the most comprehensive review and critique of process models incorporating the acquisition of digital forensics yet undertaken...|$|E
