50|$|The <b>onion</b> <b>thrips</b> is {{the most}} serious insect pest attacking onion crops in the tropics. The thrips rasp and pierce the surface of the plant with their mouthparts, mostly {{choosing}} young plant growth. They then add digestive juices and suck up the fluids that seep from the wounds. As the plant part grows, so do the damaged regions, leaving silvery streaks. The more thrips that are present, the greater the area of plant damaged, reducing the area of foliage available for photosynthesis. At the same time, more water is transpired and pathogens {{can find a way to}} gain entry. In severely damaged plants, leaves may wither and the whole plant may appear silvery; the crop ripens prematurely but the yield is greatly reduced.|$|E

When these prey species are not available, it is able to survive and reproduce on a diet of pollen and plant exudates, although its fecundity and growth rates are reduced under these circumstances. Where two prey species are available, it will prey on the most available one.

40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>Onion</b> <b>thrips,</b> Thrips tabaci Lindeman (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), is a {{well-known}} onion pest worldwide. <b>Onion</b> <b>thrips</b> cause both direct and indirect damage to onion by feeding and ovipositing on leaves that may cause green onions (scallions) to be unmarket-able and dry bulb onion size to be reduced. <b>Onion</b> <b>thrips</b> can also transmit several plant pathogens that reduce onion bulb size and quality. One of the most economically damaging onion pathogens transmitted by <b>onion</b> <b>thrips</b> is Iris yellow spot virus (Bunyaviridae: Tospovirus). In this article, we discuss <b>onion</b> <b>thrips</b> geographical distribution, host range, biology, damage, monitoring, economic thresh-olds, and management in onion production...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to reveal if the UV-A, and visible light {{reflection}} of leaves of white cabbage varieties is correlated to resistance against <b>onion</b> <b>thrips.</b> The antixenotic resistance (AR) against <b>onion</b> <b>thrips</b> and thrips damage differed between varieties Balashi, Bloktor, Riana – considered resistant – and Green Gem, Hurricane, Quisor – considered susceptible. The solar UV-A (340 – 400 nm) and visible (401 – 650 nm) light reflection of white cabbage leaves were recorded. Correlation between AR against <b>onion</b> <b>thrips</b> and reflection of leaves in UV-A and visible range of the studied white cabbage varieties were computed. According to the AR evaluation <b>onion</b> <b>thrips</b> density was always higher on susceptible than on resistant varieties. The UV-A light reflection of head forming leaves and the contrast between head and exterior leaves (H/E) was negatively correlated with <b>onion</b> <b>thrips</b> host preference at an early stage of cabbage head formation. The visible light reflection of both head forming and exterior leaves was also negatively correlated with <b>onion</b> <b>thrips</b> host preference. Susceptible varieties had greater damage ratings at harvest than resistant ones and positive correlations were observed between AR and damage. AR against <b>onion</b> <b>thrips</b> may be affected by differences in reflection of cabbage leaves at an early growth stage. It is suggested that more intensive reflection of leaves and/or higher contrast values between the reflectance intensity of head versus outer leaves made the resistant varieties less attractive to <b>onion</b> <b>thrips.</b> Our results reported here provide the first evidence of negative correlation between UV-A and visible reflection of leaves and AR of white cabbag...|$|E

The Egyptian EPNs were tested at different concentrations and against different <b>onion</b> <b>thrips</b> stages (adult and nymph). When used as a foliage spray, the tested EPN isolates were efficient against both adult and nymph stages. Differences in pathogenicity were observed within the same EPN species as in Heterorhabditis indica (EGAZ 3) that caused higher reduction in population of T. tabaci (adult and nymph) after 24 and 48  h at a concentration of 10, 000 infective juveniles (IJs)/ml compared to H. indica (EGAZ 2) after 24  h post treatment at a concentration of 15, 000 IJs/ml. The same pattern was observed with Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (HP 88), where a higher reduction percent was recorded after 24  h at a concentration of 20, 000 IJs/ml. On the other hand, Steinernema carpocapsae (All), S. carpocapsae (EGAZ 9), and S. carpocapsae (BA 2) isolates were less effective in controlling <b>onion</b> <b>thrips</b> (adult and nymph) population. In general, controlling T. tabaci at the nymphal stage was more efficient than at the adult stage (12 – 73 % reduction at the nymph stage compared to 6 – 65 % at the adult stage).
