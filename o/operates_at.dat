5|$|A MOS Technology 6502 {{chip that}} <b>operates</b> <b>at</b> 894kHz generates the sound effects, and a speech {{synthesizer}} by Votrax generates Q*bert's incoherent expressions. The audio system uses 128B of random-access memory and 4KB of erasable programmable {{read only memory}} to store the sound data and code to implement it. Like other Gottlieb games, the sound system was thoroughly tested to ensure it would handle daily usage. In retrospect, audio engineer David Thiel commented that such testing minimized time available for creative designing.|$|E
25|$|Note that a {{compound}} engine (including multiple-expansion engines, see below) {{can have more}} than one set of variable-pressure cylinders. For example, an engine might have two cylinders <b>operating</b> <b>at</b> pressure x and two <b>operating</b> <b>at</b> pressure y, or one cylinder <b>operating</b> <b>at</b> pressure x and three <b>operating</b> <b>at</b> pressure y. What makes it compound (or double-expansion) as opposed to multiple-expansion is that there are only two pressures, x and y.|$|R
30|$|Table 4 {{shows the}} real,reactive power losses and minimum {{voltages}} after {{the placement of}} different types of DGs. The optimal location for 15 bus test system is 6. The minimum voltage is more in case of type III DG <b>operating</b> <b>at</b> 0.9 pf. The losses are also lower with DG type III <b>operating</b> <b>at</b> 0.9 pf when compared to DG <b>operating</b> <b>at</b> upf in Table 4. This is due to both real and reactive powers are supplied by the DG at lagging pf. Reactive power is not supplied by type III DG when <b>operating</b> <b>at</b> Unity pf. Hence, losses are higher when compared to DG <b>operating</b> <b>at</b> 0.9 pf lagging.|$|R

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the older AN/MPQ-53 Passive Electronically Scanned Array (PESA) radar set of the MIM-104 Patriot PAC-2, the Green Pine is an {{active electronically scanned array}} (AESA) solid state radar. Unlike the advanced AN/TPY-2 X band radar of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, Green Pine <b>operates</b> <b>at</b> L band - in the range 500 MHz to 1,000MHz, or 1,000MHz to 2,000MHz.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, BART {{had envisioned}} {{frequent}} local service, with headways {{as short as}} two minutes between trains on the quadruple-interlined section in San Francisco and six minutes on each individual line. However, headways have fallen short of the original plans. While trains do arrive every three minutes on the quadruple-interlined section between West Oakland and Daly City during weekday commute hours, each individual line <b>operates</b> <b>at</b> 15 minute intervals.|$|E
50|$|It is {{also served}} by tram line 708, <b>operated</b> <b>at</b> 10-12 minute {{intervals}} and bus route 725, <b>operated</b> <b>at</b> 10-20 minute intervals, both by Rheinbahn.|$|R

5|$|Robotron: 2084 {{features}} monaural {{sound and}} raster graphics on a 19-inch CRT monitor. It uses a Motorola 6809 {{central processing unit}} that <b>operates</b> <b>at</b> 1MHz. To produce multiple sounds on a single audio channel, the game uses a priority scheme to generate sounds in order of importance. A custom graphics coprocessor—which operates as a blitter chip—generates the on-screen objects and visual effects. The coprocessor increases the transfer speed of memory, which allows the game to simultaneously animate {{a large number of}} objects.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of the}} year, Sisimiut {{is served}} twice-weekly by coastal ferries of Arctic Umiaq Line which link the {{communities}} of the western coast. There is also a weekly Royal Arctic Line ferry to Itilleq and Sarfannguit. The port in Sisimiut is the northernmost year-round ice-free port in Greenland, serving as the country's primary maritime base north of Nuuk. Supply ships from the port head north, serving the entire coast, from the Uummannaq Fjord region, through Upernavik Archipelago, to Qaanaaq in the far north. M/S Akamalik, {{one of the largest}} ships in the fleet of Royal Greenland, is based in Sisimiut. Home to the first shipyard of Greenland dating from 1931, the port also handles more than 50 cruise liners per year. The local kayak club <b>operates</b> <b>at</b> the bay harbor east of the port.|$|E
5|$|Formerly {{known as}} the Kamloops Aero Club, the Kamloops Flying Club <b>operates</b> <b>at</b> the airport, which is a club where {{children}} receive a flight in an airplane with the pilot and learn about the airplanes themselves. In addition, the flight school Canadian Flight Centre is based on site; the branch based in Boundary Bay, Delta opened a location in Kamloops in May2012 and uses Cessna aircraft for its lessons. Canadian Helicopters operates a training facility for the Kamloops Airport Other related facilities include Astaris Canada, CC Helicopters, Highland Helicopters and WestAir Aviation. Formerly, Flight Discovery operated as a flight school at the airport, but the owner was deemed a fraud artist.|$|E

50|$|WiMAX cannot deliver 70 Mbit/s over 50 km. Like all {{wireless}} technologies, WiMAX can <b>operate</b> <b>at</b> higher bitrates or over longer distances but not both. <b>Operating</b> <b>at</b> {{the maximum}} range of 50 km increases {{bit error rate}} and thus results in a much lower bitrate. Conversely, reducing the range (to under 1 km) allows a device to <b>operate</b> <b>at</b> higher bitrates.|$|R
5|$|Law {{and order}} in the city is {{maintained}} by the Thanjavur subdivision of the Tamil Nadu Police, headed by a Deputy Superintendent (DSP). The Thanjavur district level police administration is headed by a Deputy Inspector General of Police, whose office {{is located in the}} city.

The PlayStation VR was released in October 2016.|$|E
5|$|The G <b>operates</b> <b>at</b> {{all times}} between Court Square in Long Island City, Queens, and Church Avenue in Kensington, Brooklyn, making local stops along its entire route. The G {{is the only}} non-shuttle service in the system that does not serve Manhattan. It suffers from {{constant}} service disruptions, infrequent train headways, few free transfers to other services, and low rolling stock capacity, leading to criticism from politicians and residents of the neighborhoods through which it travels. Since the 2000s, several improvements {{have been made to}} the G, including a route extension in Brooklyn and a full-route audit that identified solutions for issues on the G service.|$|E

5|$|The IEEE 802.3af Power over Ethernet (PoE) {{standard}} specifies a {{more elaborate}} power negotiation scheme than powered USB. It <b>operates</b> <b>at</b> 48VDC and can supply more power (up to 12.95W, PoE+ 25.5W) over a cable up to 100meters compared to USB2.0, which provides 2.5W {{with a maximum}} cable length of 5meters. This has made PoE popular for VoIP telephones, security cameras, wireless access points, and other networked devices within buildings. However, USB is cheaper than PoE provided that the distance is short and power demand is low.|$|E
5|$|The Museum of the Riverina was {{established}} in 1967 by the Wagga Wagga and District Historical Society. Wagga Wagga City Council took over its operations in the late 1990s and it now <b>operates</b> <b>at</b> two sites. The Historic Council Chambers site {{on the corner of}} Baylis and Morrow streets in central Wagga, hosts travelling exhibitions and the main site at the Botanic Gardens is home to the main collection including the Wagga Wagga Sporting Hall of Fame. The museum also has an important collection of memorabilia about the Tichborne Case, including a set of four rare plaster figurines depicting characters from the trial, a complete set of hard-bound court transcripts and a monumental painting entitled The Tichborne Trial painted in 1874 by Nathan Hughes, which hangs in the city's council chambers.|$|E
5|$|The league {{was formed}} in 1889 as the Birmingham & District League to cater for teams in Birmingham and the {{surrounding}} area, but soon became established {{as one of the}} strongest leagues outside the Football League itself, with teams from as far afield as Bristol and Wales taking part. After the Second World War it absorbed the rival Birmingham Combination to become firmly established as the leading league in the area, but a gradual decline in its status began in the late 1950s and it now <b>operates</b> <b>at</b> a much lower level than in its heyday.|$|E

50|$|The main public {{operator}} of high-speed trains (alta velocità AV, formerly Eurostar Italia) is Trenitalia, part of FSI. Trains {{are divided into}} three categories: Frecciarossa ("Red arrow") trains <b>operate</b> <b>at</b> a maximum of 300 km/h on dedicated high-speed tracks; Frecciargento (Silver arrow) trains <b>operate</b> <b>at</b> a maximum of 250 km/h on both high-speed and mainline tracks; Frecciabianca (White arrow) trains <b>operate</b> <b>at</b> a maximum of 200 km/h on mainline tracks only.|$|R
5|$|The {{low-pressure}} oxidizer turbopump (LPOTP) is an {{axial-flow pump}} which <b>operates</b> <b>at</b> approximately 5,150 rpm {{driven by a}} six-stage turbine powered by high-pressure liquid oxygen from the high-pressure oxidizer turbopump (HPOTP). It boosts the liquid oxygen's pressure from , with the flow from the LPOTP then being supplied to the HPOTP. During engine operation, the pressure boost permits the high-pressure oxidizer turbine to operate at high speeds without cavitating. The LPOTP, which measures approximately , {{is connected to the}} vehicle propellant ducting and supported in a fixed position by being mounted on the launch vehicle's structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{probability}} {{of the creation}} of strangelets decreases at higher energies. As the LHC <b>operates</b> <b>at</b> higher energies than the RHIC or the heavy ion programs of the 1980s and 1990s, the LHC is less likely to produce strangelets than its predecessors. Furthermore, models indicate that strangelets are only stable or long-lived at low temperatures. Strangelets are bound at low energies (in the range of 1–10MeV), while the collisions in the LHC release energies in the range of 7–14TeV. Thermodynamics very strongly disfavors the formation of a cold condensate that is an order of magnitude cooler than the surrounding medium. As an example, it is about as likely as producing an icecube in a furnace.|$|E
5|$|Tourist {{facilities}} in Sisimiut include several youth hostels and hotels, such as Hotel Sisimiut with Restaurant Nasaasaaq, and Seaman's Home, and a conference center. The other restaurant of note is the Misigisaq Restaurant, {{located at the}} harbor. It is the only Chinese restaurant {{in the country and}} it uses Greenlandic ingredients cooked in the Chinese style. The town has a heated open-air swimming pool, which is supported on stilts so that the heat does not melt the permafrost. Several camping sites are located in Sisimiut valley and near the Kangerluarsunnguaq bay.
