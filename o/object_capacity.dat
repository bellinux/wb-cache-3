40|$|What changes when an {{evolutionary}} transition in individuality takes place? Many different answers have been given, {{in respect of}} different cases of actual transition, but some have suggested a general answer: that a major transition {{is a change in}} the extent to which selection acts at one hierarchical level rather than another. The current paper evaluates some different ways to develop this general answer as a way to characterise the property ‘evolutionary individuality’; and offers a justification of the option taken in Clarke (J Philos 110 (8) : 413 – 435, 2013) —to define evolutionary individuality in terms of an <b>object’s</b> <b>capacity</b> to undergo selection at its own level. In addition, I suggest a method by which the property can be measured and argue that a problem which is often considered to be fatal to that method—the problem of ‘cross-level by-products’—can be avoided...|$|R
50|$|An {{interface}} {{is defined}} as the common boundary formed between two different phases, such as between a solid and gas. Electric potential, or charge, is the result of an <b>object's</b> <b>capacity</b> to be moved in an electric field. An interfacial potential is thus defined as a charge located at the common boundary between two phases (for example, an amino acid such as glutamate on the surface of a protein can have its side chain carboxylic acid deprotonated in environments with pH greater than 4.1 to produce a charged amino acid at the surface, which would create an interfacial potential). Interfacial potential is responsible for the formation of the electric double layer, which has a broad range of applications in what is termed electrokinetic phenomena. The development of the theory of the electric double layer is described below.|$|R

The overall {{aim of the research}} investigation is to disseminate current understanding and best practice on the relationships between designing and writing and their mutual interest in speculation, expression and research. While most discussions around this topic adopt one of two (often polarized) distinct positions – the written text as sole authority and a design <b>object’s</b> <b>capacity</b> to be read as a cultural artefact – our investigation looks at various media of design articulation directly linked to design as a system of inquiry including but not limited to diaries, diagrams and choreographic notation and comics.

40|$|Estimates of the {{capacity}} of visuospatial short-term memory (VSTM) have ranged from less than 1 item to 4 +/- 1 items. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to find {{the capacity}} of VSTM by looking at the contribution of the other working memory systems (phonological loop and central executive) and determine the factor that limits VSTM capacity (either number of objects or object complexity). In this study, the psychophysiological measure of cerebral blood flow velocity also was incorporated to determine whether changes in cerebral blood flow velocity were indicative of VSTM performance and capacity. Both performance measures and cerebral blood flow velocity indicate that capacity for random polygons is approximately one object. Complexity of the <b>objects</b> affected <b>capacity,</b> such that simple <b>objects</b> had higher <b>capacities</b> and lower cerebral blood flow velocity than complex objects. Other working memory systems were not found to have an effect on performance...|$|R
40|$|Of {{the many}} comfort foods available, {{chocolate}} {{is identified as}} being the most craved, tellingly expressed by the coinage of such terms as “chocolate addiction” or “chocoholic. ” It has become a fetishized commodity in the United States that people associate with reward, comfort, luxury and sensuality. “Chocolate consumption” is an appropriately ambiguous phrase for it may refer to either the purchasing or the eating of chocolate. The unresolved tension of this ambiguity draws forth the latent connotation of “consumption” where both meanings are combined – consumption is the act by which a consumer merges with a commodity. It is this deeper significance and its close relationship to the Marxist phenomenon of fetishism that I will explore. This paper seeks to answer the question, “How is chocolate {{an example of a}} fetishized commodity in 21 st century U. S. society?” My study will touch upon the overall structural and supportive role of fetishism within the capitalist system, but primarily aims to clarify the exact mechanism by which the consumer class is successfully manipulated by it. I argue that chocolate marketing exemplifies the way a commodity’s fetish status may be created and intensified through the promise of an <b>object’s</b> <b>capacity</b> to transform the consumer’s deepest aspects of his or her self...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{allocation}} of indivisible <b>objects</b> with <b>capacity</b> constraints {{to a set of}} agents when each agent receives at most one object and monetary compensations are not possible. Important applications of this model are the assignment of students to public schools, university admissions, and university housing allocation. We assume that students in these situations have strict preferences over the (object) types (e. g., admission to a specific school or university or dormitory rooms of a certain type) and that (object) types might come with a capacity constraint (the maximal number of students a school or university can admit or the maximal number of dormitory rooms of the same type). An allocation rule is a systematic way of solving any allocation problem (with capacity constraints). In most papers that study {{the allocation of}} indivisible <b>objects</b> with <b>capacity</b> constraints, externally prescribed priorities are also specified; this class of problems is usually referred to as “school choice problems ” or “student placement problems”. Balinski and Sönmez (1999) were the first to formulate the allocation problem based on priorities, which in many real life situation naturally arise, e. g., in school choice students who live closer to a school and/or have siblings attending a school have higher priority at that school.

40|$|The key {{question}} is: How can the optimal long term level of capacity be determined, if only short term conditions are known, and the agent's skills {{to uncover the}} long term characteristics are limited? This thesis develops a simple and unified solution algorithm as an alternative approach to long term decisions under uncertainty. It is based on stochastic approximation and the gradient method, and is designed such that an agent acquires knowledge of the best long term capacity via adaptive learning from discrete observations in a stochastic market. By non-linear programming, the choice of long term capacity made by a profit maximizing monopolist under uncertainty is simulated numerically. The effect of various types of uncertainty on the agent's long term decisions are examined. Both one (capacity) and multiple learning <b>objects</b> (<b>capacity</b> price and slope) are implemented in the experiments. Based on the numerical experiments it is shown that the algorithms produce results in line with economic intuition. The numerical results are also compliant to others findings {{for a wide range}} of initial guesses, and for all types of uncertainty applied in this thesis. Even when demand is unknown, and a proxy demand curve is applied, the algorithms provides sufficient information so that the agent becomes able to make an effecient long term capacity choice under uncertainty...|$|R

5000|$|Dharmakīrti's {{philosophy}} {{is based on}} the need to establish a theory of logical validity and certainty grounded in causality. Following Dignāga's Pramāṇasamuccaya, Dharmakīrti also holds that there are only two instruments of knowledge or 'valid cognition' (pramāṇa); [...] "perception" [...] (pratyaksa) and [...] "inference" [...] (anumāṇa). Perception is a non-conceptual knowing of particulars which is bound by causality, while inference is reasonable, linguistic and conceptual. In the Pramāṇavārttika Dharmakīrti defines a pramana as a [...] "reliable cognition". What it means for a cognition to be reliable has been interpreted in different ways. Following commentators like Dharmottara, who define it as meaning that a cognition is able to lead to the obtaining of one's desired object, some modern scholars such as Jose I. Cabezon have interpreted Dharmakīrti as defending a form of Pragmatism. Tillemans sees him as holding to a weak form of correspondence theory, which holds that to [...] "confirm causal efficacy" [...] (arthakriyāsthiti) is to have a justification that an object of cognition has the causal powers we expected. That justification comes through a certain kind of non-conceptual perception (pratyakṣa) which is said to be an [...] "intrinsical source of knowledge" [...] (svataḥ prāmāṇya) which is ultimately reliable. Dharmakīrti sees a cognition as being valid if it has a causal connection with the object of cognition through an intrinsically valid, un-conceptual perception of the object which does not err regarding its functionality. As Dharmakirti says: [...] "A pramāṇa is a reliable cognition. for reliability, it consists in cognition’s compliance with <b>object’s</b> <b>capacity</b> to perform a function" [...] (Pramāṇavārttika 2.1ac).|$|R

In an earlier work [1], we proposed a method based on multiscale edge detector and a sub-image homomorphic filtering, with parameters optimized by means of a genetic algorithm. An experiment using image measures and a subjective evaluation compared the results of that method with the ones of a plain Canny edge detector. Some benefits of the method were highlighted, but no inferential statistical analysis was presented at that time.|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} determination of sediments amount in Svitava river and Křtinský potok, which flows into Svitava river in Adamov. Elements are sedimented at the riverbed bottom if the resulting force {{caused by the}} water stream on particles is smaller than the gravitational force. Elements {{can get into the}} stream both by washing from surrounding terrain and by material erosion of the riverbed which happens more frequently. Therefore another part of this thesis is suggesting of suitable stabilization measures and flood protection of selected <b>objects.</b> The <b>capacity</b> of riverbeds becomes smaller due to their sedimentation. Particle-size characteristics of sediment runoffs have been prepared and thus the amount of sediment runoffs has been calculated and critically evaluated...|$|R

40|$|Visual {{short-term}} memory (VSTM) is limited, especially for complex <b>objects.</b> Its <b>capacity,</b> however, is greater for faces than for other objects; this advantage {{may stem from}} the holistic nature of face processing. If the holistic processing explains this advantage, object expertise-which also relies on holistic processing-should endow experts with a VSTM advantage. The authors compared VSTM for cars among car experts and car novices. Car experts, but not car novices, demonstrated a VSTM advantage similar to that for faces; this advantage was orientation specific and was correlated with an individual's level of car expertise. Control experiments ruled out accounts based solely on verbal- or long-term memory representations. These {{findings suggest that the}} processing advantages afforded by visual expertise result in domain-specific increases in VSTM capacity, perhaps by allowing experts to maximize the use of an inherently limited VSTM system. 14 page(s...|$|R

How large a group could you monitor successfully? This paper reports on six experiments in which observers monitor a group of entities, watching for an event. Whether the event was performed by a single entity or was an interaction between a pair, the capacity for event monitoring was two to three items. This was lower than the multiple <b>object</b> tracking <b>capacity</b> for the same stimuli (approximately six items). Capacity was essentially the same whether entities were identical circles or unique cartoon animals; nor was capacity changed by an added requirement to identify the entities involved in an event. Event monitoring appears to be related to, but not identical to, multiple object tracking.|$|R

40|$|In many {{economic}} environments - such {{as college}} admissions, student placements at public schools, and university housing allocation - indivisible <b>objects</b> with <b>capacity</b> constraints {{are assigned to}} a set of agents when each agent receives at most one object and monetary compensations are not allowed. In these important applications the agent-proposing deferred-acceptance algorithm with responsive priorities (called responsive DA-rule) performs well and economists have successfully implemented responsive DA-rules or slight variants thereof. First, for house allocation problems we characterize the class of responsive DA-rules by a set of basic and intuitive properties, namely, unavailable type invariance, individual rationality, weak non-wastefulness, resource-monotonicity, truncation invariance, and strategy-proofness. We extend this characterization to the full class of allocation problems with capacity constraints by replacing resource- monotonicity with two-agent consistent con ict resolution. An alternative characterization of responsive DA-rules is obtained using unassigned objects invariance, individual rationality, weak non-wastefulness, weak consistency, and strategy-proofness. Various characterizations of the class of "acyclic" responsive DA-rules are obtained by using the properties efficiency, group strategy-proofness, and consistency...|$|R
40|$|In {{college admissions}} and student {{placements}} at public schools, the admission decision {{can be thought}} of as assigning indivisible <b>objects</b> with <b>capacity</b> constraints to a set of students such that each student receives at most one object and monetary compensations are not allowed. In these important market design problems, the agent-proposing deferred-acceptance (DA-) mechanism with responsive strict priorities performs well and economists have successfully implemented DA-mechanisms or slight variants thereof. We show that almost all real-life mechanisms used in such environments - including the large classes of priority mechanisms and linear programming mechanisms - satisfy a set of simple and intuitive properties. Once we add strategy-proofness to these properties, DA-mechanisms are the only ones surviving. In market design problems that are based on weak priorities (like school choice), generally multiple tie-breaking (MTB) procedures are used and then a mechanism is implemented with the obtained strict priorities. By adding stability with respect to the weak priorities, we establish the first normative foundation for MTB-DA-mechanisms that are used in NYC...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{operational}} train timetabling {{is to find}} {{a conflict}} free timetable for a set of passenger and freight trains with predefined stopping time windows along given routes in an infrastructure network so that station capacities and train dependent running and headway times are observed. Typical models for this problem are based on time-discretized networks for the train routes coupled by conflict constraints. They grow very fast for large scale instances and quickly lead to intractable models. Motivated by the observation that relaxations mostly use a narrow corridor inside such networks, we develop a general dynamic graph generation framework in order to control this size even for infinite time horizons. It can be applied to time-discretized networks modelling the routing of <b>objects</b> through <b>capacity</b> restricted handling stations with the property that early paths in the network are preferred. Without sacrificing any information compared to the full model, it includes a few additional time steps on top of the latest arcs currently in use.
