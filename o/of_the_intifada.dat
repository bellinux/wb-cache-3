In the wake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Intifada,</b> unemployment rates rose from 14.2% in 1997 to 60% in 2004. According to an OCHA report in 2008, {{one of the reasons for}} the high unemployment was a ring of checkpoints around the city, leading to the relocation of many businesses.|$|E
25|$|Intra-Palestinian {{violence}} {{was also a}} prominent feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Intifada,</b> with widespread executions of an estimated 822 Palestinians killed as alleged Israeli collaborators, (1988–April 1994). At the time Israel reportedly obtained information from some 18,000 Palestinians who had been compromised, although fewer than half had any proven contact with the Israeli authorities.|$|E
25|$|The Israeli state {{apparatus}} carried out contradictory and conflicting policies that were {{seen to have}} injured Israel's own interests, such as the closing of educational establishments (putting more youths onto the streets) and issuing the Shin Bet list of collaborators.

25|$|The success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Intifada</b> gave Arafat and his {{followers}} the confidence they needed to moderate their political programme: At {{the meeting of the}} Palestine National Council in Algiers in mid-November 1988, Arafat won a majority for the historic decision to recognise Israel's legitimacy; to accept all the relevant UN resolutions going back to 29 November 1947; and to adopt the principle of a two-state solution.|$|E
25|$|After Israel's {{capture of}} the West Bank, Jerusalem, Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip from Jordan and Egypt in the Six-Day War in 1967, {{frustration}} grew among Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories. Israel opened its labor market to Palestinians in the newly occupied territories. Palestinians were recruited mainly to do unskilled or semi-skilled labor jobs Israelis did not want. By the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Intifada,</b> over 40 percent of the Palestinian work force worked in Israel daily. Additionally, Israeli confiscation of Palestinian land, high birth rates in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the limited allocation of land for new building and agriculture created conditions marked by growing population density and rising unemployment, even for those with university degrees. At the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Intifada,</b> only one in eight college-educated Palestinians could find degree-related work. Couple this with an expansion of a Palestinian university system catering to people from refugee camps, villages, and small towns generating new Palestinian elite from a lower social strata that was more activist and confrontational with Israel.|$|E
25|$|The Intifada is {{sometimes}} called the Oslo War (מלחמת אוסלו) by some Israelis who consider {{it to be the}} result of concessions made by Israel following the Oslo Accords, and Arafat's War, after the late Palestinian leader whom some blamed for starting it.

On March 5, as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Intifada</b> and the Mountain War, the Lebanese Government canceled the May 17 agreement and the Marines departed a few weeks later.|$|E
25|$|The First Intifada of mass {{protests and}} rioting by Palestinians in the {{occupied}} West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza started in 1987, and children frequently participated. In {{an article in the}} London Review of Books, American professors John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt claimed that the Israel Defense Forces ("IDF") encouraged troops to break protesters' bones. The Swedish branch of Save the Children estimated that during the first two years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>intifada,</b> between 23,600 and 29,900 children required medical treatment for such beating injuries and that nearly a third were under the age of ten.

25|$|On 25 June, a {{military}} outpost {{was attacked by}} Palestinian militants and a gunbattle followed that left 2 Israeli soldiers and 3 Palestinian militants dead.

In {{the early hours of}} 28 June Israeli tanks, APCs and troops entered the Gaza strip just hours after the air force had taken out two main bridges and the only powerstation in the strip, effectively shutting down electricity and water. Operation Summer Rains commenced, the first major phase of the Gaza–Israel conflict, which continues to run independently <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>intifada.</b>|$|E

50|$|According to B'Tselem, {{there was}} a decline, {{starting}} in 1998, in <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> Palestinians held in administrative detention.

However, with <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Second <b>Intifada</b> (2000), and particularly after Operation Defensive Shield (2002), the numbers steadily rose. According to the Fédération Internationale des ligues des Droits de l'Homme (FIDH), from <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Second <b>Intifada</b> to April 2003, more than 28,000 Palestinians were incarcerated.

25|$|On 26 September 2002, {{after an}} Israeli airstrike wounded Mohammed Deif, {{the leader of}} Hamas's {{principal}} armed wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Jabari became the commander and operational head of the military wing {{at the height of}} the Second Intifada (the armed Palestinian uprising against Israel from 2000–2007). However, Deif remains its official head. According to Hamas political leader Ayman Taha, since Jabari took over the al-Qassam Brigades' day-to-day operations, Hamas's armed wing became increasingly professional. During the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Intifada,</b> he directed several attacks against Israel, including suicide bombings, that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Israeli civilians and soldiers.|$|E
25|$|The ending {{date of the}} Second Intifada is disputed, {{as there}} was no {{definite}} event that brought it to an end. Some commentators such as Sever Plocker consider the intifada to have ended in late 2004. With the sickness and then death of Yasser Arafat in November 2004, the Palestinians lost their internationally recognised leader of the previous three decades, after which the intifada lost momentum and lead to internal fighting between Palestinian factions (most notably the Fatah–Hamas conflict), as well as conflict within Fatah itself. Israel's unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip, announced in June 2004 completed in August 2005, is also cited, for instance by Ramzy Baroud, as signalling the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>intifada.</b> Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas vowed {{in the days leading}} to the Sharm el-Sheikh Summit of 2005 that it would mark the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>intifada.</b> The summit resulted in Abbas declaring violence would come to an end, and Ariel Sharon agreeing to release 900 Palestinian prisoners and withdraw from West Bank towns, some consider this to be the official end of the Second Intifada, although sporadic violence still continued outside PA control or condolence. On February 8, 2005 Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon announced the cease-fire. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) refused to be parties to the agreement, the cease-fire being the position of the Palestinian Authority only. Five days later Abbass reached agreement with the two dissenting organisations to commit to the truce with the proviso that Israeli violation would be met with retaliation. Schachter addressed the difficulties in deciding when this intifada ended. He reasoned that suicide bombing was the best criterion, being arguably the most important element of second intifada-related violence, and that according to this criterion the intifada ended during 2005.|$|E
25|$|Israel {{adopted a}} policy of arresting key representatives of Palestinian institutions. After lawyers in Gaza went on strike to protest their {{inability}} to visit their detained clients, Israel detained the deputy head of its association without trial for six months. Dr. Zakariya al-Agha, {{the head of the}} Gaza Medical Association, was likewise arrested and held for a similar period of detention, as were several women active in Women's Work Committees. During Ramadan, many camps in Gaza were placed under curfew for weeks, impeding residents from buying food, and Al-Shati, Jabalya and Burayj were subjected to saturation bombing by tear gas. During the first year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Intifada,</b> the total number of casualties in the camps from such bombing totalled 16.|$|E

25|$|Rock-throwing {{and mass}} demonstrations had played {{no part in}} Fatah's {{previous}} guerrilla activities, and the uprising came as a complete surprise to the PLO Stone-throwing, which had been intermittent and confined locally, broke out on a large systematic organized and spontaneous grassroots scale and took root with the First Intifada in December 1987 {{after two decades of}} Israeli rule, becoming the major symbol <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>intifada</b> itself. Those who participated, among the best-educated in the Middle East, took to brandishing their banned national flag and throwing rocks and molotov-bombs at IDF forces, to express their frustrations at limited opportunities after decades of growing up under Israeli occupation. It has been called 'the first stone-throwing rebellion against Israel.' Shame and guilt for not doing enough to help their parents or free their land also played a motivational role.|$|E
25|$|I {{knew that}} the end of September was the last period (of time) before the explosion, but when Sharon reached the al-Aqsa Mosque, this was the most {{appropriate}} moment for the outbreak <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>intifada....</b> The night prior to Sharon's visit, I participated in a panel on a local television station and I seized the opportunity to call on the public to go to the al-Aqsa Mosque in the morning, for it was not possible that Sharon would reach al-Haram al-Sharif just so, and walk away peacefully. I finished and went to al-Aqsa in the morning.... We tried to create clashes without success because of the differences of opinion that emerged with others in the al-Aqsa compound at the time.... After Sharon left, I remained for two hours in the presence of other people, we discussed the manner of response and how it was possible to react in all the cities (bilad) and not just in Jerusalem. We contacted all (the Palestinian) factions.|$|E
25|$|In September 2000 the Second Intifada {{broke out}} after the Camp David Summit peace talks failed. A sharp rise in {{violence}} involving PA security forces and Israeli soldiers and civilians during this time, whether considered acts of resistance or of militancy, contributed to a cessation of security cooperation between Israel and Palestine though the U.S. attempted to restore ties. Israeli troops reoccupied areas formerly under PA rule and added hundreds of roadblocks and checkpoints throughout the territories and began {{the construction of a}} controversial barrier along {{the entire length of the}} West Bank, which was justified by Israel as a necessary security measure but described by Palestinians as an effort to take away their land. Additionally during the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Intifada,</b> Israel destroyed most of the PA security infrastructure including ministry buildings, barracks, and other facilities. U.S. covert assistance to Palestinian intelligence agencies for counter-terrorism work is reported to have continued throughout the Intifada, even though all public international security assistance was withheld from the PA during the course of the fighting.|$|E

25|$|The Israeli {{response}} to the Palestinian uprising was harsh. The IDF killed many Palestinians at the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Intifada,</b> the majority killed during demonstrations and riots. Since initially {{a high proportion of}} those killed were civilians and youths, Yitzhak Rabin adopted a fallback policy of 'might, power and beatings'. Israel used mass arrests of Palestinians, engaged in collective punishments like closing down West Bank universities for most years of the uprising, and West Bank schools for a total of 12 months. Round-the-clock curfews were imposed over 1600 times in just the first year. Communities were cut off from supplies of water, electricity and fuel. At any one time, 25,000 Palestinians would be confined to their homes. Trees were uprooted on Palestinians farms, and agricultural produce blocked from being sold. In the first year over 1,000 Palestinians had their homes either demolished or blocked up. Settlers also engaged in private attacks on Palestinians. Palestinian refusals to pay taxes were met with confiscations of property and licenses, new car taxes, and heavy fines for any family whose members had been identified as stone-throwers.|$|E
