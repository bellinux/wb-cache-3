500|$|Indigenous Australians in New South Wales mixed {{the venom}} {{with that of}} snakes and pine tree gum to form a broth used to coat spear tips. Slim Newton drew popular {{attention}} to redbacks with his song [...] "The Redback <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Toilet</b> Seat", which won the Golden Guitar at the first Country Music Awards of Australia in 1973. Newton recalled an occasion when a friend used his outside toilet where the light globe had blown and reported he was lucky {{there was not a}} redback spider <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> seat. The phrase inspired him to write the song. [...] A sculpture of an impossibly large redback, one of Australia's big things, was built in 1996 at Eight Mile Plains, Queensland. The Angels 1991 album Red Back Fever takes its name from the spider. Matilda Bay Brewing Company produces a wheat beer called Redback, with the distinctive red stripe as the logo. The redback appears in the name and emblem of the South Australia cricket team. The Airborne Redback, an Australian ultralight trike, was also named after the spider. Redback Boots is an Australian workboot manufacturing company, which uses the spider in its name and logo. In 2006 a redback spider stamp was designed as part of a [...] "Dangerous Australians" [...] stamp series, but was withheld from general circulation by Australia Post due to concerns that the realistic depiction would scare people opening their letter boxes.|$|E

500|$|On {{the evening}} of August 16, 1977, Presley was {{scheduled}} to fly out of Memphis to begin another tour. That afternoon, Ginger Alden discovered him in an unresponsive state on his bathroom floor. According to her eyewitness account, [...] "Elvis looked as if his entire body had completely frozen in a seated position while using the toilet and then had fallen forward, in that fixed position, {{directly in front of}} it. [...] It was clear that, from the time whatever hit him to the moment he had landed on the floor, Elvis hadn't moved." [...] Joel Williamson writes: [...] "For some reason— perhaps involving a reaction to the codeine and attempts to move his bowels— he experienced pain and fright while sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet.</b> Alarmed, he stood up, dropped the book he was reading, stumbled forward, and fell face down in the fetal position. He struggled weakly and drooled on the rug. Unable to breathe, he died." [...] Attempts to revive him failed, and death was officially pronounced at 3:30p.m. at Baptist Memorial Hospital.|$|E

A young man, Lee, enters the room but does not find the pair, though they are later found and joined by Rebecca's prudish brother Carl, and then Carl's flamboyant partner Stuart. Jeremy's ex-girlfriend Rachel finds the group and joins them. Ian mentions that Jeremy frequently talks about [...] "you", but {{it is unclear whether}} he is talking to Rebecca or Rachel. To Rebecca's annoyance, Stuart, Rachel and Ian briefly leave the wardrobe for a break. Stuart enters the en suite where Geraldine is sat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet.</b> In the wardrobe, Carl and Rebecca talk; the former is uncomfortable, and, when Rebecca asks why, he tells her to [...] "look where we are".|$|E
500|$|In each panel, Dyer {{is framed}} by a doorway, and set against a flat, {{anonymous}} foreground coloured with black and brown hues. In the left frame, he is seated on a toilet with his head crouched between his knees as if in pain. Although his arched back, thighs and legs are according to the Irish critic Colm Tóibín, [...] "lovingly painted", Dyer is by now clearly a broken man. The central panel shows Dyer sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> bowl in a more contemplative pose, his head and upper body writhing beneath a hanging lightbulb which throws a large bat-like shadow formed {{in the shape of}} a demon or Eumenide. The art critic Sally Yard has noted that in the portrayal of Dyer's flesh, [...] "life seems to visibly drain... into the substantial character of the shadow beneath him". Dyer's posture suggests he is seated on a lavatory bowl, though the object is not described. Schmied has proposed that in this frame the blackness of the background has enveloped the subject, and it [...] "seems to be advancing forward over the threshold, threatening the viewer like a flood or a giant bat with flapping wings and extended claws." ...|$|E

500|$|More recent {{research}} has revealed {{that it was only}} Dr Francisco who told the news people that Elvis apparently died of heart failure. In fact, the doctors [...] "could say nothing with confidence until they got the results back from the laboratories, if then. That would be a matter of weeks." [...] One of the examiners, Dr E. Eric Muirhead [...] "could not believe his ears. Francisco had not only presumed to speak for the hospital's team of pathologists, he had announced a conclusion that they had not reached." [...] "Early on, a meticulous dissection of the body ... confirmed [...] Elvis was chronically ill with diabetes, glaucoma, and constipation. As they proceeded, the doctors saw evidence that his body had been wracked over a span of years by a large and constant stream of drugs. They had also studied his hospital records, which included two admissions for drug detoxification and methadone treatments." [...] Therefore, Frank Coffey is of the opinion that a plausible cause of Elvis' death is [...] "a phenomenon called the Valsalva maneuver (essentially straining <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> leading to heart stoppage— plausible because Elvis suffered constipation, a common reaction to drug use)..." [...] In similar terms, Dr Dan Warlick, who was present at the autopsy, [...] "believes Presley's chronic constipation— the result of years of prescription drug abuse and high-fat, high-cholesterol gorging— brought on what's known as Valsalva's maneuver. Put simply, the strain of attempting to defecate compressed the singer's abdominal aorta, shutting down his heart." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} sessions {{took place}} in February 1973, Wexler provided Nelson and his band with a studio in New York City, {{where most of the}} recordings were produced. Doug Sahm and his band were also invited to the sessions. During the first session, Nelson recorded the songs for The Troublemaker. Later, he proceeded with Shotgun Willie. Wexler had encouraged Nelson after singing the gospel album to start with the new one, to couple old material with new, and covers. He initially recorded twenty-three tracks along with his and Sahm's band, but Nelson still was not inspired. He wrote the title song after one of the sessions. Pacing in his hotel room, he went to the bathroom, where he sat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> and took the empty envelope from a sanitary napkin from the sink, and penned the song on that. The title of the song refers to the nickname Nelson received after his daughter, Susie, warned him of the domestic abuse suffered by her sister Lana. Nelson drove to Lana's house, where he fought with her husband Steve Warren, and threatened to kill him if he repeated the assault. Soon after Nelson returned home, Warren arrived in his truck with his brothers. The men shot at the house with [...]22 caliber rifles. In response, Nelson and Paul English shot at the aggressors that retreated. When they returned later, Nelson took English's M1 Garand and shot the truck, causing them to surrender. He completed the rest of the song with a reference to John T. Floore, owner of the honky-tonk Floore's Country Store. After hearing the completed song, Wexler decided that the album was to be named after it.|$|E

No, not <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> but in public in the bar of our restaurant. It wasn't much money either, If I recall correctly it was fl. 50. Those few ten-guilder notes aren't even enough to cover the witnesses' expenses, since all the witnesses had to travel from Rotterdam to here. The KNVB pays fl. 0.35 per kilometre." [...] "Quite a crappy story indeed, Derksen wrote, but then again, that's what we're accustomed to. You wanna know who were present in court at the time? Me, another journalist and a man with a tape recorder. Derksen wasn't there. Probably on the toilet." ...|$|E
