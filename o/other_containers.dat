5|$|Beside the weapons, each zduhać {{carried a}} milk bucket and a peck measure; an {{alternative}} {{for the latter}} could be a shovel or broom from a threshing floor. If a band of zduhaći succeeded to seize the peck measures from the enemy band, they would thereby transfer the crop yield from the area of their enemies to their own area. Seizing the milk buckets meant that the milk yield would be transferred. According to the clan of Kuči, zduhaći used their peck measures, milk buckets, and <b>other</b> <b>containers</b> to grab off the overall yield of the enemy territory.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{melting point}} of gallium {{allows it to}} melt in the human hand, and then refreeze if removed. The liquid metal has a strong {{tendency}} to supercool below its melting point/freezing point. Seeding with a crystal helps to initiate freezing. Gallium {{is one of the}} four metals (with caesium, rubidium, and mercury) that are known to be liquid at, or near, normal room temperature. Of the four, gallium {{is the only one that}} is neither highly reactive nor highly toxic and can therefore be used in metal-in-glass high-temperature thermometers. It is also notable for having one of the largest liquid ranges for a metal, and for having (unlike mercury) a low vapor pressure at high temperatures. Gallium's boiling point, 2673K, is more than eight times higher than its melting point on the absolute scale, the greatest ratio between melting point and boiling point of any element. Unlike mercury, liquid gallium metal wets glass and skin, along with most other materials (with the exceptions of quartz, graphite, and Teflon), making it mechanically more difficult to handle even though it is substantially less toxic and requires far fewer precautions. Gallium painted onto glass is a brilliant mirror. For this reason as well as the metal contamination and freezing-expansion problems, samples of gallium metal are usually supplied in polyethylene packets within <b>other</b> <b>containers.</b>|$|E

25|$|The third very {{frequently}} used, however, qualitative technique is the T-maze and its adaptations for microplates.

The incubation is stopped with resetting the peg, the cell number is counted from the containers.|$|E
25|$|The huge waves which {{battered}} northern Somalia {{after the}} 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami were initially {{believed to have}} stirred up illegally dumped toxic and nuclear waste. There are also heavy metals such as lead, cadmium and mercury. The waves broke up rusting barrels and <b>other</b> <b>containers</b> and hazardous waste dumped along the long, remote shoreline in the war-racked country during the early 1990s, according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).|$|E
25|$|Carbohydrate-containing plant {{materials}} {{are allowed to}} ferment, producing a dilute solution of ethanol in the process. Spirits such as whiskey and rum are prepared by distilling these dilute solutions of ethanol. Components other than ethanol, including water, esters, and other alcohols, are collected in the condensate, which account for {{the flavor of the}} beverage. Some of these beverages are then stored in barrels or <b>other</b> <b>containers</b> to acquire more flavor compounds and characteristic flavors.|$|E

25|$|Usually {{during this}} maceration, the {{fermentation}} process starts with ambient yeasts in the cellar. Often the wine will have fermented {{to the point}} where the grape spirits are added before maceration has ended and the wine is pressed off the skins, a process known as mutage sur grains. The added alcohol during maceration allows for more ethanol-soluble phenolics and flavor compounds to be extracted. After pressing, the wine is left to settle in concrete vats over the winter before it is racked into barrels or <b>other</b> <b>containers.</b>|$|E
25|$|Windows Forms Designer: The Windows Forms {{designer}} is used {{to build}} GUI applications using Windows Forms. Layout can be controlled by housing the controls inside <b>other</b> <b>containers</b> or locking them {{to the side of}} the form. Controls that display data (like textbox, list box and grid view) can be bound to data sources like databases or queries. Data-bound controls can be created by dragging items from the Data Sources window onto a design surface. The UI is linked with code using an event-driven programming model. The designer generates either C# or VB.NET code for the application.|$|E

The second hall features finds from the area including clay figures, pots, <b>other</b> <b>containers,</b> and items of stone and shell, along with recreations of the two main murals of the pyramid complex.

25|$|Packaging is the {{operation}} {{to put the}} wine in the container in which it will be marketed. Over the ages it was kept in a barrel or cask and the client would fill his pitcher or bottle at the wine merchant. The appearance of the glass bottle revolutionized the world of wine. The absence of transfer and thus contact with the oxygen in the air has made a significant improvement {{to the quality of}} the product. <b>Other</b> <b>containers</b> have emerged: the brick from Tetra Pak, the bottle of polyethylene terephthalate or PET, the beverage can, and the Bag-In-Box. Their quality is in their chemical inertness in relation to wine and their hermetic character against oxygen.|$|E
25|$|In the United States {{federal law}} does not dictate any {{container}} requirements for cremation. Certain states, however, may require an opaque or non-transparent container of all cremations. This can be a simple corrugated-cardboard box or a wooden casket (coffin). Most casket manufacturers provide lines of caskets that are specially built for cremation. Another option is a cardboard box that fits inside a wooden shell, {{which is designed to}} look like a traditional casket. After the funeral service, the box is removed from the shell before cremation, permitting the shell to be re-used. Funeral homes may also offer rental caskets, which are traditional caskets used only during the services, after which the bodies are transferred to <b>other</b> <b>containers</b> for cremation. Rental caskets are sometimes designed with removable beds and liners, which are replaced after each use.|$|E
