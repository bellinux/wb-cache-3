500|$|The episode {{contained}} several {{sequences of}} Josef Kobold throwing up. Spotnitz had not intended {{the finished product}} to feature all the shots but the editor at that time, Chris Cooke, [...] "cut it that way." [...] Spotnitz felt that it [...] "was so completely over the top." [...] To create the shots, the production crew used tubes which supplied the faux vomit. The tubes were discreetly fitted to actor James Remar's mouth. Remar, in turn, only had to <b>open</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> during the shooting of the sequence. Spotnitz later joked that he had [...] "a thing for vomiting".|$|E
500|$|Turner interviewed flautist John Payne for the book, who had {{sat in on}} {{sessions}} with Van Morrison and later collaborated with him. Payne comments on their work together on the album Astral Weeks, which also included musicians Connie Kay, Warren Smith, Jay Berliner, and Richard Davis: [...] "Ironically, the image you have {{when you listen to}} the album now is of these guys who are all together, and they realise they are creating a monumental work of art. The fact is that it was just another session for them." [...] Payne states of his observations of Van Morrison's performance style: [...] "When (Van) was on stage, he would look like a space cadet, but then he'd <b>open</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and you would realize that he had channeled everything into the sound of his voice. The rest of it was just a shell that was there for the purpose of producing this noise." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{took about}} six weeks to write the Blood Beast script. It was written under the working title Creature from Galaxy 27, which was {{conceived}} by Varno, but the Corman brothers later changed it to Night of the Blood Beast. Gene Corman received film credit for conceiving the film's story, but Varno claimed he wrote the film almost entirely himself and that Corman {{had little to do}} with the story: [...] "He had some rambling ideas but they didn't have very much to do with the movie that became Night of the Blood Beast." [...] Varno also said of him: [...] "Gene didn't <b>open</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> really, until Roger told him he could." [...] Varno said he wrote the screenplay alone and showed parts of it to Roger and Gene Corman as he went along. Varno researched medical and aerospace technology at a library in Hollywood near Vine Street. The story, which fictionally portrays America's manned voyage into space, was heavily influenced by the real life Space Race ongoing between the United States and Soviet Union at the time. Gene Corman said another major inspiration was The Thing from Another World (1951), a Howard Hawks-directed science fiction film about a group of soldiers and scientists threatened by an alien creature in a remote Arctic research outpost. He said of the film, [...] "How could you not be ? We had to be, if only indirectly or subconsciously. That was a classic film then, a classic film today." [...] However, Varno said any influence from The Thing was only subconscious: [...] "I loved some of the scenes in The Thing and I'm sure that crept in one way or another, but not overtly." ...|$|E

2500|$|Marillac, {{reporting}} {{the news of}} Cromwell's arrest to Francis I, wrote that [...] "considering that public affairs thereby entirely change their course, especially as regards the innovations in religion of which Cromwell was principal author, the news seems of such importance that {{it ought to be}} written forthwith" [...] and in another letter to Montmorency noted [...] "the division among this King's ministers, who are trying to destroy each other. Cromwell's party seemed the strongest lately by the taking of the dean of the Chapel, bp. of Chichester, but it seems quite overthrown by the taking of the said lord Cromwell, who was chief of his band, and there remain only on his side the abp. of Canterbury, who dare not <b>open</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> and the lord Admiral, who has long learnt to bend to all winds, and they have for open enemies the duke of Norfolk and the others. The thing is the more marvellous as it was unexpected by everyone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some of the {{principal}} authors of such interpretations were William Durandus, Bishop of Mende (whose work is important as {{an account of the}} prayers and ceremonies of the thirteenth century), Benedict XIV and Cardinal John Bona. A favourite idea is that the Ordinary to the Sanctus, with its readings, represents Christ's public life and teaching; the Canon is a type of the passion and death, and is said in silence, because, though Christ taught plainly, he did not <b>open</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> when he was accused and suffered. From Durandus comes the idea of dividing the Mass according to the four kinds of prayer mentioned in : it is an [...] "obsecratio" [...] (supplication) to the Secret, an [...] "oratio" [...] (prayer) to the Pater Noster, a [...] "postulatio" [...] (intercession) to the Communion, and a [...] "gratiarum actio" [...] (thanksgiving) to the end. Benedict XIV and many others divide the Canon itself into four sets of threefold prayers: ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{his show}} Lou Dobbs Tonight, Dobbs {{stopped short of}} a full {{endorsement}} of Presidential candidate Donald Trump, saying, [...] "Whatever you think of Trump, whatever your politics, Trump has taken on enormous risk and threats in seeking the presidency ... promised to restore {{the voice of the}} people ... and a government that will respect all that our Constitution assures." [...] Dobbs has since endorsed Donald Trump. In October 2017, Dobbs said that the Trump presidency [...] "may be the most accomplished in modern American history." [...] Trump praised Dobbs in return. Later that month, Dobbs interviewed Trump, with numerous observers describing Dobbs's interview style as fawning and sycophantic. Dobbs opened the interview with [...] "You have accomplished so much", and later said to Trump that he was “one of the most loved and respected” presidents “in history.” The New York Times described the interview as a love-fest and [...] "courtier-like session", as Dobbs [...] "didn’t so much ask questions as <b>open</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and let rose petals fall out".|$|E
