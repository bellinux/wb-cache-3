One is too much taken up with what <b>one</b> <b>sees</b> and hears in Paris, however firm one may be, and what I am painting here has at least the merit of not resembling anyone...because it will be simply the expression of what I shall have felt, I myself, personally.|$|E
5|$|The eastern clock face {{features}} an outer ring of large golden Roman numerals, {{on which the}} larger hand indicates the hour, {{and an inner ring}} on which the smaller hand indicates the minutes. The golden sun on the hour hand is pivot-mounted so that it always faces up. Below the clock face <b>one</b> <b>sees</b> an idealised profile of city founder Duke Berchtold V of Zähringen. While the exact decoration of the clockface has varied from renovation to renovation, the current (post-1983) layout is generally that of 1770.|$|E
5|$|There are {{virtually}} no {{parts of the}} world left where the weapon dance is directly connected with imminent or recent combat. This is especially true of European states, which have long since moved away from the tribalism that usually gives rise to such folk dances. It is, however, also true of {{parts of the world}} where tribal traditions have succumbed to colonialism and the forces of globalism. The dances that <b>one</b> <b>sees</b> today are often part of general movements to preserve and rejuvenate tribal or local traditions. Some of these movements are quite strong now, such as those among native North American tribes and the aboriginal peoples of Australia.|$|E

50|$|Nature {{reserves}} in Poland are divided into: fauna (141), landscape (108), forest (722), peat-bog (177), flora (169), water (44), inanimate nature (72), steppe (32) and halophyte (4). Another division is into the regular and strict nature reserves; the strict <b>ones</b> <b>see</b> no human activity, whereas the regular <b>one</b> <b>see</b> limited maintenance.|$|R

5|$|Similar to the Moor-Christian {{confrontation}} of the morisca—whether in Spain or in transplanted versions in Central America—there are also elaborate ritual dances in Mexico {{such as the}} Danza de la Pluma that exploit {{the trauma of the}} Spanish conquest of indigenous America. Weapons employed may be swords (and shields) whips, even firearms. These representations take place over a large area of Mesoamerica and, in part, are an obvious adaptation of Spanish tradition, but in Mexico will pit the native Aztec against the Spanish invader. The most interesting aspect of these dances is that—depending on where <b>one</b> <b>sees</b> them and under what conditions—it is plausible to read into the dances an outcome other than the historical Spanish victory. That is, indigenous performers may take inspiration {{from the fact that the}} natives of Spain drove out the Moorish invaders; thus, the natives of Mesoamerica, too, shall one day drive out the invaders.|$|E

25|$|Helnwein {{is part of}} a {{tradition}} going back to the 18th century, to which Messerschmidt's grimacing sculptures belong. <b>One</b> <b>sees,</b> too, the common ground of his works with those of Arnulf Rainer and Hermann Nitsch, two other Viennese, who display their own bodies in the frame of reference of injury, pain, and death. And <b>one</b> <b>sees</b> how this fascination with body language goes back to the expressive gesture in the work of Egon Schiele.|$|E

25|$|The {{separation}} between {{interior and exterior}} - and between structure and image - was to be developed very purposefully in the Renaissance and beyond, especially once the dome became reinstated in the Western tradition as {{a key element in}} church design. Michelangelo's dome for St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, as redesigned between 1585 and 1590 by Giacomo della Porta, for example, consists of two domes of which, however, only the inner is structural. Baltasar Neumann, in his baroque churches, perfected light-weight plaster vaults supported by wooden frames. These vaults, which exerted no lateral pressures, were perfectly suited for elaborate ceiling frescoes. In St Paul's Cathedral in London there is a highly complex system of vaults and faux-vaults. The dome that <b>one</b> <b>sees</b> from the outside is not a vault, but a relatively light-weight wooden-framed structure resting on an invisible - and for its age highly original - catenary vault of brick, below which is another dome, (the dome that <b>one</b> <b>sees</b> from the inside), but of plaster supported by a wood frame. From the inside, one can easily assume that one is looking at the same vault that <b>one</b> <b>sees</b> from the outside.|$|E

25|$|What <b>one</b> <b>sees</b> are roundels {{depicting}} various common animals—pigs, monkeys, water buffaloes, roosters and snakes.

25|$|In {{coniferous}} or softwood species {{the wood}} cells are mostly of one kind, tracheids, {{and as a}} result the material is much more uniform in structure than that of most hardwoods.

25|$|Hilbert {{spaces are}} central to many applications, from quantum {{mechanics}} to stochastic calculus. The spaces L2 and ℓ2 are both Hilbert spaces.
