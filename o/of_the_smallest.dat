Some of the largest seeds come from trees, but the largest tree, Sequoiadendron giganteum, produces one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> tree seeds. The great diversity in tree fruits and seeds reflects the many different ways that tree species have evolved to disperse their offspring.|$|E

5|$|Three small moons orbit between Mimas and Enceladus: Methone, Anthe, and Pallene. Named {{after the}} Alkyonides of Greek mythology, they are some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> moons in the Saturn system.

5|$|A {{considerable}} amount of new knowledge about plant function comes from studies of the molecular genetics of model plants such as the Thale cress, Arabidopsis thaliana, a weedy species in the mustard family (Brassicaceae). The genome or hereditary information contained in the genes of this species is encoded by about 135 million base pairs of DNA, forming one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> genomes among flowering plants. Arabidopsis was the first plant to have its genome sequenced, in 2000. The sequencing of some other relatively small genomes, of rice (Oryza sativa) and Brachypodium distachyon, has made them important model species for understanding the genetics, cellular and molecular biology of cereals, grasses and monocots generally.|$|E

He turned to hockey as an outlet when he borrowed an old pair of skates and a broken stick to play his first game at the age of five. From that point on, he played hockey at every opportunity, often accompanying his father to the arena in Russell in the pre-dawn hours. He was described by his teachers as a determined youth, who would repeat any activity he failed at until he got it right.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Clement Attlee, the Labour Prime Minister, {{called a}} general election. Dunglass {{was invited to}} stand once again as Unionist {{candidate}} for Lanark. Having been disgusted at personal attacks during the 1945 campaign by Tom Steele, his Labour opponent, Dunglass did not scruple to remind the voters of Lanark that Steele had warmly thanked the Communist Party and its members for helping him take the seat from the Unionists. By 1950, with the Cold War at its height, Steele's association with the communists was a crucial electoral liability. Dunglass regained the seat with one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> majorities in any British constituency: 19,890 to Labour's 19,205. Labour narrowly won the general election, with a majority of 5.|$|E
5|$|Lord Grey's first {{announcement}} as Prime Minister was {{a pledge}} to carry out parliamentary reform. On 1 March 1831, Lord John Russell brought forward the Reform Bill in the House of Commons on the government's behalf. The bill disfranchised 60 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> boroughs, and reduced the representation of 47 others. Some seats were completely abolished, while others were redistributed to the London suburbs, to large cities, to the counties, and to Scotland and Ireland. Furthermore, the bill standardised and expanded the borough franchise, increasing {{the size of the}} electorate (according to one estimate) by half a million voters.|$|E

5|$|Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> {{species have}} become extinct, {{requiring}} vigilance in {{the conservation of}} the wild species. Narcissi are increasingly under threat by over-collection and threats to their natural habitats by urban development and tourism. N. cyclamineus has been considered to be either extinct or exceedingly rare but is not currently considered endangered, and is protected. The IUCN Red List describes five species as 'Endangered' (Narcissus alcaracensis, Narcissus bujei, Narcissus longispathus, Narcissus nevadensis, Narcissus radinganorum). In 1999 three species were considered endangered, five as vulnerable and six as rare.|$|E
5|$|Mura {{also has}} support during their matches from their ultras group, named the Black Gringos. Statistically, both teams always enjoyed {{one of the}} biggest attendances on their matches and, in term of numbers, both teams had one of the largest fan bases in the country. The fact that Prekmurje is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> and least {{populated}} regions in Slovenia has made Mura's fans labeled, by the general public, {{as one of the most}} loyal in the country. Statistically, Maribor is the more successful club, considering either the case of matches from the period from 1967 to 2005, or the whole period from 1967 to present day.|$|E
5|$|State law {{requires}} that wards be compact and contiguous and that the largest ward may not exceed the population <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> by more than 10% of the average ward size. Ward boundaries are redrawn, as needed, by a board of ward commissioners consisting of two Democrats and two Republicans appointed at the county level and the municipal clerk. Redrawing of ward lines in previous decades have shifted traditional boundaries, so that downtown currently occupies portions of the East and Central Wards. The boundaries of the wards are altered for various political and demographic reasons and sometimes gerrymandered, especially the northeastern portion of the West Ward.|$|E

5|$|Switzerland has an {{overwhelmingly}} private sector economy and low tax rates by Western World standards; overall taxation is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> of developed countries.

The slow growth Switzerland experienced in the 1990s and the early 2000s has brought greater support for economic reforms and harmonisation with the European Union. According to Credit Suisse, only about 37% of residents own their own homes, {{one of the lowest}} rates of home ownership in Europe. Housing and food price levels were 171% and 145% of the EU-25 index in 2007, compared to 113% and 104% in Germany.|$|E
5|$|The Shetland is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> British breeds. The ewes {{are usually}} polled (hornless) and the rams usually horned, {{although}} horned ewes and polled rams do occur occasionally. The breed is {{noted for its}} very fine, soft wool and the high quality of its meat, though its smaller size limits its use in commercial meat markets. They are small-bodied animals, with some wool on their faces, noses or legs, but not in excess. The legs are of medium length and finely boned. They have small, erect ears. A distinguishing feature of northern short-tailed sheep is the short, fluke-shaped tail, broad at the base, tapering to a point, and covered towards the tip in hair, not wool.|$|E
5|$|The meat, blubber, baleen, and oil of baleen whales have {{traditionally}} {{been used by the}} indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Once relentlessly hunted by commercial industries for these products, cetaceans are now protected by international law. However, the North Atlantic right whale is ranked critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Besides hunting, baleen whales also face threats from marine pollution and ocean acidification. It has been speculated that man-made sonar results in strandings. They have rarely been kept in captivity, and this has only been attempted with juveniles or members of one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> species.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to sleeve gastrectomy procedure, {{the connection between}} the stomach and the duodenum is closed off from <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second segment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> duodenum.

Thus, distal part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine is ‘’interposed’’ between proximal part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine and <b>the</b> stomach.

5|$|Andromeda {{is one of}} the 48 constellations {{listed by}} the 2nd-century Greco-Roman {{astronomer}} Ptolemy and remains one of the 88 modern constellations.

Andromeda is most prominent during autumn evenings in the Northern Hemisphere, along with several other constellations named for characters in the Perseus myth. Because of its northern declination, Andromeda is visible only north of 40° south latitude; for observers farther south it lies below the horizon. It {{is one of the}} largest constellations, with an area of 722 square degrees.
