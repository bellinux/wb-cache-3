5|$|Coimbre died on November 4, 1989, when he {{was trapped}} in a house fire. The fire {{originated}} in the house's kitchen while he was cooking, consuming the structures wooden frame. When Coimbre tried to escape {{he was unable to}} <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> because he had locked it with a padlock.|$|E
25|$|Moyne {{arrived in}} his car with his driver, Lance Corporal Arthur Fuller, his secretary, Dorothy Osmond, and his ADC, Major Andrew Hughes-Onslow. The ADC went to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> of the {{residence}} and the driver got out {{to open the door}} for Moyne. They were suddenly told not to move, as Bet-Zuri emerged and shot Fuller in the chest, causing him to collapse in the driveway and bleed to death in minutes. Hakim then pulled the car door open and shot Moyne three times. The first bullet hit him in the neck on the right side, just above the clavicle, the second penetrated his abdomen, punctured his colon and large intestine, and became embedded {{to the right of the}} second lumbar vertebrae, while the third shot, fired after Moyne raised his right hand, ripped across four of his fingers and went in and out of his chest, causing no serious injuries.|$|E
2500|$|The Sherritt {{home was}} a typical period two-room slab hut, which Dan {{could see through the}} bedroom and kitchen to Joe in the back. When Weekes had first knocked, Constable William Duross had been talking with Sherritt and his wife in the kitchen. He joined the three other policemen, Henry Armstrong, Thomas P. Dowling, and Robert Alexander, in the bedroom. Even though they were big men, well-armed and {{experienced}} [...] "protectors", they remained there in the dark in fear while Sherritt was shot. Byrne then told Ellen Barry to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> of the hut. When she did, Dan Kelly was revealed a few feet away. Joe ordered the frightened women to leave the house, then the outlaws began shooting into the walls of the bedroom. The police threw themselves to the floor.|$|E

60|$|Jeeves made a long arm and <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> and <b>the</b> old boy crawled in, looking licked to a splinter.|$|R
60|$|Uncle Roger {{unlocked}} {{and flung}} <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> As he did so, clear and sweet, rang out ten bell-like chimes.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Jobling, {{to conceal}} his amazement and to obtain a little fresh air walked out of <b>the</b> room and <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R

60|$|It {{was nearly}} mid-day when Alvina heard the gate. She hurried to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> Madame {{was in her}} little black hat and her black spotted veil, Ciccio in a black {{overcoat}} was closing the yard door behind her.|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt, no doubt. Is Mr Bold's horse there? That's right; <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> Good-morning, Mr Bold;" [...] and {{the doctor}} stalked into his own drawing-room, {{closing the door behind}} him, and making it quite {{impossible}} that John Bold should speak another word.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Grant and Mohegan {{continued}} in the hall, while {{the remainder of the}} party withdrew to an eating parlor, if we except Benjamin, who civilly remained to close the rear after the clergyman and to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> for the exit of the Indian.|$|E

60|$|Under {{this last}} trial of her fortitude, Mrs. Bowmore's feeble {{reserves}} of endurance completely gave way. The poor lady turned faint and giddy. Amelia placed {{her on a}} chair in the hall, and told the cook to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> and let in the fresh air.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell {{her not to}} come here. This is {{no place}} for her now. They never <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> now. This {{is no place for}} any one now, but just father and me. But tell her how I love her. I'll never forget her; no, not in my grave!" ...|$|E
60|$|He profited by Fitzpiers's example; dismounting, he tied {{his horse}} under an {{adjoining}} tree, {{and went on}} to the house on foot, as the other had done. He was no longer disposed to stick at trifles in his investigation, and did not hesitate to gently <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> without ringing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait a minute," [...] {{said the}} youth, {{and left the}} window. Presently he <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> slipped gently out {{and closed the door}} behind him.|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't care," [...] {{she said}} with a little laugh. [...] "That is the first kiss I have ever given to a man, and very likely it will be the last.

60|$|Thady {{at length}} {{succeeded in getting}} her to the house; and pushing <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> which was still unlatched, with his foot, took her into her own room on the left hand side of the passage, and {{deposited}} her still insensible on the sofa. He then went into the kitchen, and sent Katty to her assistance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Coffee for one, cook," [...] I says, and she understood. Her cap and apron {{were hanging}} behind the door. I flung them across to her, and she caught them; and then I <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{took the}} key {{out of the}} lock, and led me downstairs into the hall. After a little consideration, he <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> of <b>the</b> house. The {{gardener}} was still quietly {{at work in the}} grounds.|$|R
