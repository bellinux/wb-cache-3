The {{development}} of a state project is started from the ideal stage, feasibility study, the preparation of a proposal to the issuance of the project filling-in list in a work. After {{the completion of the}} process of financing the work, the process is then continued to arrange a contractor service in getting the work done through a competitive. The contractors will adopt strategy to wits the bid and the owner will give the contractor with the lowest, responsive and responsible opportunity to win the project, through an administrative, technical and price evaluations for the bids meeting the requirements at the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tender.</b> The objective <b>of</b> the study is to investigate the competing bidding strategy in a <b>tender</b> <b>of</b> the irrigation project of Dinas Pekerjaan Unium Daerah Tingkat I Bengkulu. The study is conducted using secondary and primary data. The secondary data is used to investigate the strategy used by the contractor in establishing the bidding price value with the calculation of Friedman strategy model and to determine the impact of the bidding percentage on the real cost. The primary data is used to investigate the implementation of the system evaluation in the competitive bidding. Based on the result of the study it is clearly observed that for the project of Water Source Management and Flood Controlling in the first work to the sixth work the mark-up taking place is 3. 35 % to 9 % because of the difficulty rate of the work, while for the seventh work to the tenth work the mark-up approaches 80 % OE (real work cost). The condition indicates that the competition becomes increasingly strict. At the Project of Swampy Area Development there is a variation of - 13. 82 %, and the average of negative in nature. It is because the OE is too high determined that once the evaluation process have been in completion the value - 13. 82 % is still considered to be normal to win. The winner <b>of</b> the <b>tender</b> <b>of</b> the first work experience a high rate of difficulties at the Irrigation Project, that the contractor gives the bid just at the upper level. The mark-up value for the second work is - 2. 23 % because of the OE value is too high determined. In general, the value of the winner <b>of</b> the <b>tender</b> is on the limiting line of 80 % OE, because the value is the limit of the bidding price that can be. accounted for...|$|R

This paper explores the barriers to understanding the cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering.</b> Throughout the worldwide construction industry tendering is acknowledged to be complicated, adding considerable cost to construction. Efforts to understand the cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> are confounded by issues that are both visible and invisible to formal accounting of the construction process. This paper intends to demonstrate the problems and their causes. Anecdotes are derived from the literature, observations of construction purchases, and interview data to demonstrate the barriers to understanding the cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering.</b> This is augmented by corresponding observations of other major purchases. Problems and causes are described in terms of these anecdotes. Because of the diverse activities undertaken by constructors and limitations of accounting categories, expenses associated with tendering are difficult to capture and quantify. These problems are explained through examples. Even in those cases where there are genuine intentions to capture costs <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> there is a failure to do so. It appears that implementation difficulties are so insurmountable that either people do not bother or management redirects effort from collecting cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> data. It is also shown that the expense <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> and uncertainty <b>of</b> outcomes leads tenderers to engage in concealed behaviour to reduce the uncertainty and cost associated with tendering. That is, collusion. For this reason especially, it is concluded that tendering and associated costs need to be understood in greater detail...|$|R
