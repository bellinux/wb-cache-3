40|$|Abstract – Blighted {{red pine}} shoots, either having {{symptoms}} only <b>on</b> <b>the</b> most <b>recent</b> year’s growth or having symptoms present both on most recent and previous year’s growth, were examined for pycnidia of Sirococcus conigenus, Diplodia pinea, or both. On shoots having symptoms only <b>on</b> <b>the</b> most <b>recent</b> year’s growth, S. conigenus was detected {{more frequently than}} D. pinea. On shoots having symptoms <b>on</b> both <b>the</b> most <b>recent</b> and <b>the</b> previous year’s growth, however, D. pinea was detected more frequently than S. conigenus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> most <b>recent</b> year’s growth. In addition, on those shoots having symptoms <b>on</b> both <b>the</b> most <b>recent</b> and <b>the</b> previous year’s growth, D. pinea was detected almost eight times more frequently <b>on</b> <b>the</b> previous year’s growth than <b>the</b> most <b>recent</b> year’s growth. Whether only one pathogen was detected or the two pathogens were detected co-occurring on a single year’s growth also varied with shoot condition and shoot year of growth, but the two fungi co-occurred on shoots of each condition.

25|$|According to Ashley Mallett's {{biography}} of Ian Chappell, Chappelli Speaks Out, Bill Lawry was considering selecting Jordon {{to play in}} the fourth test instead of Taber because of the former's superior batting. Chappell said he would not play in the side if Jordon was picked because the wicketkeeper was a cheat. This was based on an incident during a game <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> Indian tour when Australia was playing South Zone. E. A. S. Prasanna was facing Alan Connolly with Jordon standing up to the stumps – he appeared to miss the ball and his off stump was knocked forward. Jordon appealed and Prasanna eventually walked but Chappell believed the ball had missed Prasanna's stumps and rebounded off Jordon's pads to break the wicket – and that Jordon knew this.|$|E

25|$|The {{delay in}} {{finalising}} {{the form of}} the Commission and its membership was caused by disputes within the government and parliament. The Secretary of State for the Colonies expressed doubts about an inquiry related to Nyasaland alone, and governor Armitage was opposed to any form of Commission, particularly one containing any member of parliament. Despite strong parliamentary pressure for its members' involvement, the cabinet decided on 17 March 1959 that the inquiry would be carried out by a Commission of three and a presiding judge: the government announced its composition on 24 March. The commission was to inquire into and report <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> disturbances in Nyasaland and the events leading up to them. They arrived in the protectorate on 11 April and spent five weeks there, a week in Southern Rhodesia and four days in London. They took evidence from 455 individual witnesses and 1,300 witnesses in groups. The Nyasaland government presented many documents to the Commission and later gave it oral evidence. Although Devlin had been a Conservative supporter and the other commissioners were Conservatives party members, the Commission went about its work in a way that concerned the Nyasaland government, which had hoped that its declaration of the State of Emergency and the subsequent actions of the police and troops would be vindicated.|$|E

500|$|With {{liability}} established, {{the court}} then recommended an amount for the damages {{to be paid}} by Harrison and Apple to Bright Tunes, which Owen totalled at $1,599,987 – amounting to three-quarters of the royalty revenue raised in North America from [...] "My Sweet Lord", {{as well as a}} significant proportion of that from the All Things Must Pass album. This figure has been considered over-harsh and unrealistic by some observers, since it both underplayed the unique elements of Harrison's recording – the universal spiritual message of its lyrics, the signature guitar hook, and its production – and ignored the critical acclaim his album received in its own right. Elliot Huntley observes: [...] "People don't usually hear a single and then automatically go and buy an expensive boxed-set triple album on the off-chance." [...] The award factored in the royalty revenue raised from [...] "My Sweet Lord"'s inclusion <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> Best of George Harrison compilation, though at a more moderate percentage than for the 1970 album.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} a new [...] {{motorcycle}} was conceived in 1956, when Honda Motor's Soichiro Honda and Takeo Fujisawa toured Germany and witnessed the popularity of mopeds and lightweight motorcycles. Soichiro Honda was primarily the engineering and production leader of the company, always with an eye towards winning on the racetrack, while his close partner Fujisawa was the man of finance and business, heading up sales and formulating strategies intended to dominate markets and utterly destroy Honda Motor's competitors. Fujisawa {{had been thinking about}} a long term expansion strategy, and unlike other Japanese companies, {{they did not want to}} simply boost production to cash in <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> economic boom in Japan. A small, high-performance motorcycle was central to his plans. Upwardly mobile consumers in postwar Europe typically went from a bicycle to a clip-on engine, then bought a scooter, then a bubble car, and then a small car and onwards. Fujisawa saw that a motorcycle did not fit in this pattern for the average person, and he saw an opportunity to change that. Soichiro Honda was at the time tired of listening to Fujisawa talk about his new motorcycle idea; Honda came to Europe to win the Isle of Man TT race and wanted to think about little else.|$|E
500|$|Jeff {{has stated}} that {{starting}} from the album The Painful Experience they incorporated their own approach to record drum tracks in the studio which they call [...] "hybrid drums", a mix of real-time performance and software-based matrix programming. He also mentioned the efficiency of using the hybrid drumming compared with getting a drummer: [...] "About the drummer, it is still {{very hard to find}} a right drummer because Kekal music is ranging from very extreme-metal with blast beats and fast double-kicks, to powerful rock beats that demand steady tempo, and to some polyrhythmic playing and time-signature shifts in the characteristics of jazz and prog drumming. We would need 2 or 3 kinds of drummer for Kekal. That's why the best thing for the recording is to make the hybrid drumming." [...] In other interview, Jeff mentioned the process of recording of The Habit of Fire, starting from collecting samples and creating MIDI information, then manipulating the sounds to create what he called the 'skeleton'. Then riffs, MIDI-triggered instruments, synthesizers, and melodies would be added and the structure re-arranged once again. Once the song structure was set, the guitars would be re-recorded, then bass and drum tracks would be put on top, then vocals. Jeff also mentioned during the interview about the 2011 Futuride EP, that he has experimented with additive synthesis <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> songs he has recorded and uses guitars to counterbalance the sounds generated by the additive synthesis.|$|E

500|$|During {{the early}} production, {{what type of}} game it would be became crucial to whether Atlus or Fire Emblem {{developer}} Intelligent Systems would develop it. One {{of the problems that}} needed to be overcome was the form of the initial proposal, which was for a simulation game similar to Fire Emblem developed by Atlus. Atlus, who were better known for making traditional role-playing games, were unsure which series to emulate. The decision was eventually made to create {{something along the lines of}} a traditional RPG, so Atlus took on primary development. Their first concept turned out to be a grid-based strategy game with strategic positioning elements similar to Fire Emblem, but they were eventually convinced by Yamagami and staff from Intelligent Systems to keep within their own skillset rather than attempting anything radically different. The final product was visualized as a game only Atlus could make, incorporating elements from both series while standing as an original title that could be enjoyed by fans of both Shin Megami Tensei and Fire Emblem. The game's platform was chosen based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> successful Fire Emblem entries for the 3DS: as Fire Emblem had appeared on the 3DS, Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE was to be a different [...] "expression" [...] designed for the Wii U. During these early stages, proposals were also made for a 3DS version, but this never materialized. Despite its ultimate form, some of the conceptual ideas were taken from early plans for Fire Emblem Awakening to take place in a modern-day setting. The inclusion of a sharp symbol in the title, which represents a semitone increase in pitch of a note in musical notation, denoted the game's status as a unique hybrid of the two series. The inclination of the logo was also designed to represent the game's altered perspective on the Fire Emblem series. The game's cutscenes were created by Studio Anima and Studio 4°C.|$|E
