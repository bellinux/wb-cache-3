5|$|History {{may never}} know {{the true story of}} Lee's {{intentions}} at Gettysburg. He never published memoirs, and his after-action report from the battle was cursory. Most of the senior commanders of the charge were casualties and did not write reports. Pickett's report was apparently so bitter that Lee <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> to destroy it, and no copy has been found.|$|E
5|$|In a climactic confrontation, Falco reveals to Susan {{that it was}} {{her brother}} who <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> to destroy Dallas's {{reputation}} and their relationship. Hunsecker makes a call to Kello to come after Falco, who tries to flee but is caught in Times Square by the brutal cop.|$|E
5|$|A March 1779 {{letter from}} Washington to Scott, still on {{furlough}} in Virginia, <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> to recruit volunteers in Virginia and join Washington at Middlebrook on May 1. Men and supplies proved difficult to obtain, delaying Scott's return; during the delay, Washington ordered the recruits to South Carolina to join Benjamin Lincoln, {{who was in}} command of the militia forces there. Reports of significant British troop movements toward Georgia had convinced Washington that the enemy was preparing an invasion from the south.|$|E

5|$|Amir's brigade was {{now down}} to one {{battalion}}, which was to attack with Nir's brigade of 50 tanks. To Amir's surprise, a reserve armored battalion of 25 tanks commanded by Colonel Eliashiv Shemshi arrived in the area, en route to Keren's brigade. Short of forces, Amir, with Adan's approval, commandeered Shemshi's battalion, and <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> to provide covering fire for Nir's assault on the Firdan bridge.|$|E
5|$|De la Rúa {{was also}} indicted {{for the police}} {{repression}} that {{took place during the}} crisis; he was tried by judge Claudio Bonadio, who declared him innocent in 2009. The Supreme Court overturned Bonadio's ruling and <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> to further investigate the matter. De la Rúa and Cavallo were indicted for illegally benefiting the banks that took part in the Megacanje. They were declared innocent on October 6, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Even after {{becoming}} a bishop, Bloet continued to witness royal writs, witnessing six of Rufus' writs while bishop, {{to add to}} his 11 witnessed writs during his chancellorship. Bloet {{was one of the}} bishops in 1097 that attempted to persuade Anselm when the archbishop was in a dispute with Rufus over travelling to Rome to consult with the papacy. When Anselm refused to be persuaded not to go, the king <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> to leave the kingdom, with the support of most of the bishops and nobility.|$|E

5|$|General Germanus died {{in battle}} against the Persians. An army sent by Phocas against Khosrow was {{defeated}} near Dara in Upper Mesopotamia, leading to the capture of that important fortress in 605. Narses escaped from Leontius, the eunuch appointed by Phocas to deal with him, but when Narses attempted to return to Constantinople to discuss peace terms, Phocas <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> seized and burned alive. The death of Narses along with the failure to stop the Persians damaged the prestige of Phocas' military regime.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the very}} next day, Thiệu ordered Trưởng and General Lâm Quang Thi to abandon Huế and to {{concentrate}} only sufficient numbers of South Vietnamese units to hold Da Nang. On March 29, as Trưởng was about to board the navy transport ship HQ-404, he {{received a phone call}} from Thiệu, who <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> to turn back and retake Da Nang from the North Vietnamese forces. By then, however, South Vietnamese units in I Corps had virtually disappeared, and their commanding officers had fled from their posts.|$|E
5|$|I {{called to}} him to turn hard opposite, so I could {{sandwich}} the Red fighters, but in his standard-rate bomber turn he got hit. I saw {{the whole thing and}} <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> to dive and bail out immediately. To my intense relief I saw him leave the aircraft and his parachute blossom. I was happy to get this Airacobra, but I was mad at myself for not harkening to my intuition not to fly with Günther Capito.|$|E

5|$|In 1802, Nguyễn Ánh, who had {{declared}} himself Emperor Gia Long after capturing Phú Xuân (Huế), appointed Duyệt {{to the position}} of Khâm Sai Chưởng Tả Quân Dinh Bình Tây Tướng Quân ("Marshal of King's Left Division, Tây Sơn Pacification General") and <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> to attack Tây Sơn-controlled northern Vietnam. In October 1802, Duyệt captured the north, and then renamed it from Bắc Hà ("Northern River") to Bắc Thành ("Northern Citadel") thus marking ultimate victory of the Nguyễn against the Tây Sơn.|$|E

With the rest of the cavalry reserve he attacked Gregory's flank. Here again, under simultaneous attacks from the front and flanks, the Byzantines fell back, but more slowly because they had to maintain their formation.|$|E
5|$|On September 20, 2007, the Royal Bank of Canada filed a {{civil lawsuit}} in the U.S. District Court in Newport News against Vick for more than $2.3 million over a loan tied to real estate.

5|$|Prokofiev's latest opera projects, {{among them}} his {{desperate attempt to}} appease the {{cultural}} authorities, The Story of a Real Man, were quickly cancelled by the Kirov Theatre. The snub, in combination with his declining health, caused Prokofiev to progressively withdraw from public life and from various activities, even his beloved chess, and increasingly devote himself to his own work. After a serious relapse in 1949, his doctors <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> to limit his composing to an hour a day.|$|E
5|$|Word of the {{incidents}} spread, eventually reaching Patton's superior, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> to apologize to the men. Patton's actions were initially suppressed in the news until journalist Drew Pearson publicized them in the United States. While the U.S. Congress {{and the general public}} expressed both support and disdain for Patton's actions, Eisenhower and Army Chief of Staff George Marshall opted not to fire Patton as a commander. He was nonetheless sidelined from combat command for almost a year.|$|E
5|$|About 19:45, the 1st Army Group held {{a conference}} in Zagreb, just as German tanks were {{entering}} the city. Nedeljković told Petrović that {{he could no longer}} hold his positions, but despite this, Petrović <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> to hold for at least 2–3 days to enable the withdrawal of the 7th Army to the Kupa river. Nedeljković replied that he no longer had an army, and suggested that all Serb officers and men be ordered back to form a defensive line along the Sava and Una rivers. Petrović refused to consider this, but ordered the 1st Cavalry Division to form a defensive line along the Sava between Jasenovac and Zagreb.|$|E

(Honorius wrote another letter on the same day to the Bishop-elect of Whithorn, <b>ordering</b> <b>him</b> to be consecrated by Thurstan at York). However John remained unwilling, and the year 1127 was set to continue discussion about the archbishop's rights, effectively stalling Thurstan's claims.|$|R

5|$|After John Sigismund died in 1571, the Diet of Transylvania elected Stephen Báthory voivode (or ruler) in 1571. Stephen {{adopted the}} title of prince of Transylvania after he was elected king of Poland and grand duke of Lithuania in 1575. The childless king decided {{to take charge of}} his nephew's {{education}} and <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> to come to Poland in late 1578. Andrew studied at the Jesuit college in Pułtusk. His fellow-students were mainly young Protestant noblemen from Transylvania or Royal Hungary, but Polish, Lithuanian, German and Italian noblemen and commoners were also chosen to study together with him. He could speak Latin, Italian, Polish and German {{by the end of his}} studies.|$|E
5|$|After the {{publication}} of Go Quietly, Agnew largely disappeared from public view. In a rare TV interview in 1980, he advised young people not to go into politics because too much was expected of those in high public office. In 1983 a Maryland court <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> to pay the state the sum of $268,000, including interest and penalties, {{the sum of the}} bribes he had taken while a public employee. Agnew did not dispute the judgement, but seven years later applied unsuccessfully for this sum to be treated as tax-deductible. He was briefly in the news in 1987, when as the plaintiff in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, he gave the public some insight into his recent business activities.|$|E
5|$|Benedict Arnold {{continued}} on to Philadelphia, {{where he met}} with members of Congress about his rank. His action at Ridgefield, coupled {{with the death of}} Wooster due to wounds sustained in the action, resulted in Arnold's promotion to major general, although his seniority was not restored over those who had been promoted before him. Amid negotiations over that issue, Arnold wrote out a letter of resignation on July 11, the same day that word arrived in Philadelphia, that Fort Ticonderoga had fallen to the British. Washington refused his resignation and <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> north to assist with the defense there.|$|E
