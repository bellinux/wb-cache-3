40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} {{the effects of}} L 1 and L 2 glosses and their effectiveness on reading comprehension and vocabulary recall with and without computer to explore whether providing glosses can facilitate reading comprehension and vocabulary acquisition. For this purpose, 180 students who were studying English as a Foreign language (EFL) at Shokouh Language Institute (Urmia Branch, Iran) and were homogeneous according {{to the results of}} the proficiency test and identified as intermediate-level learners were selected and randomly assigned to six equivalent groups of participants: 1) computer-based text <b>without</b> <b>gloss</b> (computer-based control group), 2) computer-based L 1 (Persian) gloss, 3) computerbased L 2 (English) gloss, 4) paper-based text <b>without</b> <b>gloss</b> (traditional control group), 5) paper-based L 1 (Persian) gloss, 6) paper-based L 2 (English) gloss. Those in groups 1 and 4 had to read the texts with no access to glosses. The remaining four groups received treatment on two passages with 20 glossed words under one of four conditions. According to results of this study, glossing {{has been shown to be}} effective in reading comprehension and vocabulary recall but there was no significant difference while the focus was on the type of gloss (Persian or English). Results also showed that the availability of the computer in conducting the study had no effect on the performances of the students. This means that the compute...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to compare microhardness, {{roughness}} and micromorphology of the examined materials of a newly developed glass carbomer dental filling material to two different resin modified glass ionomers and a glass ionomer dental filling material. Specimens tested were prepared from a glass carbomer <b>without</b> <b>gloss</b> (Glass Carbomer, GCP), a glass carbomer (Glass Carbomer, GCP) with gloss, two different resin modified glass ionomers (Fuji II LC, GC and Riva LC, SDI) and a glass ionomer (Equia, GC). Seven specimens of each material were prepared according to manufacturer’s recommendations. After setting, samples were polished and stored in 37 ◦C distilled water for 24 h. Indentation microhardness of examined restorative materials was measured using the Vickers indenters. In addition surface roughness of the materials was measured using surface profilemeter. Surface morphology was analyzed by using scanning electron microscopy. There was a significant difference in microhardness and roughness between the restorative materials (p < 0. 05). The highest microhardness was measured for Equia and lowest for glass carbomer with gloss. The roughness was fully definite for the glass carbomer with gloss and indefinite for the glass carbomer <b>without</b> <b>gloss.</b> Small cracks and voids were observed in all groups. High viscosity glass ionomer cement Equia exhibits the high physical strength than RMGIC. Gloss application does not influence the hardness behavior of GCP...|$|R

Writing for British Film Institute's Screenonline website, Alexander Larman also praised Miller's performance, saying in {{a profile of the}} actor that his portrayal of Byron was [...] "sensitive and nuanced". Peter Chochran, writing about Byron portrayal on screen, described Miller as [...] "outstanding in the lead: the most successful screen Byron there is".|$|R

30|$|The {{treatment}} {{generates a}} film at the papers’ surface. The overall optical impression {{is closely related}} to the amount of nanocellulose applied: From approximately 2 % nanocellulose, slight (BNC) or very slight (NFC) hazes are clearly visible and become much more apparent with increasing amounts. Thus, letters appear more veiled with 8 % NFC or 15 % BNC. The signs of BNC look shinier when a higher amount is applied, whereas the films of NFC occur more as matt, white hazes <b>without</b> <b>gloss.</b> This is an important advantage of NFC. Besides the amount applied, the gloss with BNC is increased by using the film applicator.|$|R

This paper {{is not so much}} about how I teach, or how I could teach. Rather, it is more conceptual with respect to planning itself. More to the point: how does planning fit into this emerging, and dark, worldview? Planning, after all, is a discipline steeped in hope, and climate change seems to be bringing forth, at least for some, a palpable wave of despair. This is a direct challenge both the to idealism (if not happiness) of my students and to the principles underlying the practice of planning itself...|$|R

60|$|A great {{interpreter}} of life ought not himself to need interpretation, {{least of all}} can he need it for contemporaries. When time has wrought changes of fashion, mental and social, the critic serves a useful turn in giving to a poet or a teacher his true place, and in recovering ideas and points of view that are worth preserving. Interpretation of this kind Emerson cannot require. His books are no palimpsest, 'the prophet's holograph, defiled, erased, and covered by a monk's.' What he has written is fresh, legible, and in full conformity with the manners and the diction of the day, {{and those who are}} unable to understand him <b>without</b> <b>gloss</b> and comment are in fact not prepared to understand what it is that the original has to say. Scarcely any literature is so entirely unprofitable as the so-called criticism that overlays a pithy text with a windy sermon. For our time at least Emerson may best be left to be his own expositor.|$|R
40|$|Every {{empirical}} {{study of}} land use–travel relationships {{begins with a}} review of the literature. At least two bibliographies cover the lit-erature in annotated form (1, 2). Five extensive literature surveys are already available (3 – 7). The reader may wonder whether another literature survey can add much value. Existing surveys tend to zoom in on bottom-line results. They sel-dom tell exactly what was done in studies or how it was done, mak-ing it impossible to judge the validity and reliability of study results. Also, they seldom generalize across studies or make sense of dif-fering results. Readers are left with glimpses of many trees rather than a panoramic view of this complex and rich forest of research. This literature review generalizes across studies <b>without</b> <b>glossing</b> over real differences. It focuses on recent research for two reasons: the greater methodological sophistication and the greater variety of local land use, transportation, and site design variables tested. For earl...|$|R

Most early two-liters had a separate <b>opaque</b> <b>base</b> glued to the hemispherical bottom of the clear PET flask. This base had a coaxial corrugation and drain holes.

50|$|After cleaning, an <b>opaque</b> <b>base</b> coat {{of powder}} {{is applied to}} the glass {{substrate}} as the initial, most important layer of UV protection. Once the powder attracts, the product is heated to activate the process of gelling, which secures the adhesive bond. It is crucial to control the amount of powder that goes on to the surface. With too little, the coating becomes transparent and the protection is diminished. Too much can create a dripping effect or disperse uneven amounts, leading {{to one side of the}} glass container being heavier than the other. In the case of powder coating nail polish and other cosmetics bottles, experienced powder coaters typically use a highly chemical-resistant form of powder, which makes it impervious to the aggressive chemicals inherent with polish and primer.|$|R

40|$|In this article, a {{novel by}} the North American ecofeminist Starhawk is read for its theorisation of the {{challenge}} of imagining futures which do not secure justice for some {{at the expense of}} others. The article puts this reading of The Fifth Sacred Thing (1993) in dialogue with Jessica Benjamin's work on intersubjectivity and Vivian Sobchack's work on interobjectivity to argue that the working through of intersubjective and interobjective relationality engaged in by Starhawk's protagonists may be read as the narrative theorisation of a praxis of hope. It further claims that the practice of reading fiction as theory rather than critiquing fiction with theory can expand the potential of our capacity to imagine social transformation. It argues that feminist theory is always already hopeful because of its production from within an imagined or interpretive community that is passionately invested in the possibility of social transformation. The article concludes that the novel theorises the transformative potential of working through the anxiety and despair provoked by threats to that possibility <b>without</b> <b>glossing</b> over the risks that such a strategy entails...|$|R
