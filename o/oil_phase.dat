25|$|Mayonnaise is an oil-in-water {{emulsion}} which is stable {{at room temperature}} because it reaches phase equilibrium. At freezing temperatures, the structures inside mayonnaise undergo crystallization {{depending on the type}} of emulsion. Unlike mayonnaise, butter is a water-in-oil emulsion with the water phase having a higher freezing point than oil. When frozen, the small water droplets suspended in the continuous <b>oil</b> <b>phase</b> freeze where they are, while the rest of the oil stays in place. On thawing the butter, it regains its properties as the water droplets melt in their original locations.|$|E

Studies have shown that by surrounding the water soluble flavor extracts with the continuous <b>oil</b> <b>phase</b> of the emulsion resulted in a slower rate of flavor dispersion from the water, leading to the prolonged taste of flavor in the final product.

40|$|The {{preparation}} of Fe-particles {{by reduction of}} FeSO 4 with either sodium borohydride or lithium triethylborohydride in water, and reverse micelles in rapeseed and mineral <b>oil</b> <b>phases</b> is described in electrochemical terms. The influence of surfactants on the electrochemical parameters and resulting size of iron particles was studied as well. The resulting size of Fe-particles synthesized in water (with and without surfactants) correlates with the determined values of open circuit potential (OCP) : the more negative OCP, the obtained Fe-particles are bigger, because values of OCP correspond to different range of polarization determined for the reduction of Fe 2 +. The sizes of Fe-particles synthesized in water or <b>oil</b> <b>phases</b> without surfactants using LiBEt 3 H are less than using NaBH 4 because of electrochemical factors. By varying oils and surfactants {{it is possible to}} obtain opposite results as in water phase: smaller Fe-particles obtained using NaBH 4 than using LiBEt 3 H. It is explained by the simultaneous influence of electrochemical and steric stabilization factors, and the last one becomes dominating in some cases. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R

30|$|Because {{t-butyl alcohol}} is a water-{{miscible}} solvent and also miscible with CLA menthyl ester, {{the addition of}} t-butyl alcohol greatly changes {{the state of the}} reaction mixture which consists of two phases, i.e., aqueous and <b>oil</b> <b>phases.</b> When a small amount of t-butyl alcohol is added to the mixture, water and CLA menthyl ester are partitioned into the <b>oil</b> and aqueous <b>phases,</b> respectively. Meanwhile, the mixture will become one phase when more t-butyl alcohol is added.

40|$|Droplet {{microfluidics}} {{has recently}} {{emerged as a}} new engineering tool for biochemical analysis of small sample volumes. Droplet generation is most commonly achieved by introducing aqueous and <b>oil</b> <b>phases</b> into a T-junction or a flow focusing channel geometry. This method produces droplets that are sensitive to changes in flow conditions and fluid composition. Here, we present an alternative approach using a simple peristaltic micropump to deliver the aqueous and <b>oil</b> <b>phases</b> in antiphase pulses resulting in a robust “chopping”-like method of droplet generation. This method offers controllable droplet dynamics, with droplet volumes solely determined by the pump design, and is insensitive to liquid properties and flow rates. Importantly, sequences of droplets with controlled composition can be hardcoded into the pump, allowing chemical operations such as titrations and dilutions to be easily achieved. The push–pull pump is compact and can continuously collect samples, generating droplets close to the sampling site and with short stabilisation time. We envisage that this robust droplet generation method is highly suited for continuous in situ sampling and chemical measurement, allowing droplet microfluidics {{to step out of}} the lab and into field-deployable applications...|$|R

This biliquid foam technology was patented as polyaphron dispersions (PAD) containing a complex internal phase, which are made as droplets of oil or multiphase liquid in an aqueous (or other hydrogen-bonding liquid) phase. Oil-soluble drug molecules can be dissolved within the <b>oil</b> <b>phase,</b> and drug delivery can be influenced by modifying the materials used in each phase.

50|$|Water is {{converted}} to steam during the baking process, which is the main factor behind the leavening of the dough. The water for steam production comes from both the dough layers and the roll-in fat. As the fat melts, the continuous <b>oil</b> <b>phase</b> is {{no longer able to}} stabilize the water droplets, which are then released and converted to steam. Although the exact mechanism of steam entrapment is still unclear, it is likely a result of both steam expanding inside each dough layer and steam migrating to oil layers, where it inflates gas bubbles. The steam migration to <b>oil</b> <b>phase</b> is likely due to the smaller pressure differential required to inﬂate a bubble of steam in liquid fat than in solid dough. As the concentration of steam increases between dough layers, the increased pressure causes the dough to lift. It {{is important to note that}} during the entire baking process, only half of the water vapor contributes to dough lift, as the other half is lost through micropores and capillaries of interconnected dough layers.|$|E
