MGR had a simple beginning in stage plays {{at the age of}} six. MGR was first invited by Annadurai to star in one of his movies in the 1950s. From then on MGR actively participated in the party's meetings. His films such as Nadodi Mannan (Vagabond King, 1958), Enga Vitu Pillai (Son <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>House,</b> 1965), Nam Nadu (Our Nation, 1969), Adimai Penn (Slave Girl, 1969) and Engal Thangam (Our Gold or Our Precious, 1970) displayed a stereotypical image of a philanthropic, mundane hero made out of a vagrant who becomes a king.|$|E

2500|$|When queried by the French weekly, Point de Vue, {{as to why}} {{he claimed}} headship of the Imperial dynasty in view of his republican pretensions, Charles replied, [...] "I assume the 'moral heritage' of my name. To renounce today to my ability to become the head <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>House</b> would imply that I accept a certain number of grievances of which I have been accused...I cannot accept this {{sentence}} from another era. As for my republican sentiments, those who reproach me misunderstand the history of our family. Bonaparte – General, then First Consul – defended the Republic." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the words}} of the Qur'an never {{explicitly}} state that Abraham's dream was a Divine command. The Quran only states that Abraham had a dream, which he interpreted as a command from God, and Abraham was eventually stopped by God Himself from [...] "sacrificing" [...] his son. This is {{in stark contrast to the}} Jewish/Christian narratives, and also the mainstream Sunni/Shia narratives which assume the biblical narrative is true. According to Islam, the problem with this interpretation is that it yields a logical contradiction, as it is clearly stated that no life can be taken without a just cause, and there was no just cause for Abraham to take the life of his son. There are non-mainstream translations and expositions of the Qur'an which harmonize the incident of Abraham's sacrifice and make the narrative of these verses consistent with the Quran's own laws, such as the one by Ghulam Ahmed Pervez, who translates the key verses as follows: 'We immediately removed this thought from Abraham’s mind and called out to him, O Abraham. You considered your dream as Allah's command and laid your son for the purpose of slaughtering him! This was not Our command, but merely a dream of yours. Therefore, We have saved you and your son from this. We have done so because We keep those who lead their lives according to Divine guidance safe from such mishaps.' (37: 104-105). As for the term [...] "sacrifice", the meaning of this term as it relates to Ishmael in the following verses is explained as: [...] "As far as the son is concerned, We saved him for a far greater and tremendous sacrifice. (This great sacrifice refers to the fact that instead of keeping his leadership confined to Syria, We wanted him to become the custodian <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> <b>House</b> the Ka'bah, which was located in the far off barren land of Arabia and which had to become the center and gathering place of all those the world over, who believed in the unity of God (internal reference 14:37))." ...|$|E
