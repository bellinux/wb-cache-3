40|$|Software Process Improvement {{initiatives}} {{have been implemented}} by many companies {{in order to achieve}} quality of products and practices. Many models like CMMI and IDEAL have been adopted as a means to gain competitive advantages among competitors and trustworthiness of customers. Although these models have proved successful results, the inherent characteristics of SMEs make it difficult and in many cases unfeasible to implement such models, without meaning that those companies are less capable of producing quality products or adopting well-defined practices. This research presents a model to guide Software Process Improvement (SPI) according to the context of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) using the <b>Open</b> <b>Maturity</b> Model (OMM) elaborated by the QualiPSo consortium. Different literature reviews, a survey and a focus group were done in order to build the theoretical foundations that support the structure of the proposed SPI model, validate the findings and evaluate the resulting SPI model. SPI in SMEs, CMMI implementations in SMEs, issues affecting SPI programs, and Knowledge Management approaches supporting improvement of software processes and practices are the four main pillars of the theoretical background supporting the design of the proposed SPI model, which is the major outcome of this thesis project and is aimed to guide SPI programs considering OMM assessment results. The proposed SPI model was subject of a preliminary evaluation with researchers and a validation with practitioners. The results have confirmed that SPI outcomes are more valuable when business requirements and SPI objectives are chosen to drive the improvement actions. The importance of organizational awareness and the value of knowledge management strategies to mitigate potential problems faced when implementing SPI has also been highlighted when evaluating the model...|$|E

40|$|Open {{innovation}} {{can introduce}} {{new ways of}} organizing the innovation process within companies, but these new activities and processes naturally require some time to mature and work effectively. Continuous improvement of capacities and results is therefore required (Teece et al., 1997; Winter, 2003). The basic aim {{of this research was}} to develop, in collaboration with 15 companies, an <b>open</b> innovation <b>maturity</b> framework to measure and benchmark excellence in open innovation. The <b>open</b> innovation <b>maturity</b> framework that was developed combines metrics in several areas of open innovation to illustrate the expertise of that organization. It can reveal organizational excellence as well as areas of improvement in order to reach the next level of <b>maturity.</b> <b>Open</b> innovation, metrics, excellence, maturity framework...|$|R

50|$|The {{fruit is}} usually a schizocarp, but {{sometimes}} a drupe. A typical schizocarp is the regma, a capsular fruit with three or more cells, each of which splits <b>open</b> at <b>maturity</b> into separate parts and then breaks away explosively, scattering the small seeds.|$|R
50|$|The seed cones are globose, 8-15 mm long, with 6-10 scales (usually 8), green, {{maturing}} {{dark brown}} about 24 months after pollination. The cones <b>open</b> at <b>maturity</b> to shed the seed. The pollen cones are 3-5 mm long, and release pollen in early spring.|$|R
50|$|The cones are conic to ovoid, reddish brown, and 9 cm long by 6 cm broad when open. They <b>open</b> at <b>maturity</b> in September to October of {{the second}} year to release the oblong black seeds, 4 - 5 mm long with a 16 mm wing.|$|R
50|$|Many of {{the species}} are adapted to forest fires, holding their seeds {{for many years in}} closed cones until the parent trees are killed by a fire; the seeds are then {{released}} to colonise the bare, burnt ground. In other species, the cones <b>open</b> at <b>maturity</b> to release the seeds.|$|R
50|$|It is a tree {{growing to}} 27-34 m tall, with a trunk {{diameter}} up to 1 m with flaky reddish-grey bark. The leaves are pinnate, with 11-13 leaflets. The flowers are produced in panicles. The fruit is a thorny pod 6-9 cm long, {{which does not}} split <b>open</b> at <b>maturity.</b>|$|R
50|$|The non-fleshy {{fruit is}} usually a capsule, {{breaking}} <b>open</b> at <b>maturity</b> to release the seeds through pores (poricidal), through the partitions between the cells (septicidal), or by means of valves (valvular). The numerous seeds are small. Their nutritive tissue (endosperm) is oily and farinose. The fruit of Platystemon is a schizocarp.|$|R
50|$|Fruit-bodies (ascomata) are large, {{more or less}} spherical to turbinate (like a top), thick-walled, and solid. The asci {{are formed}} in marbled veins {{interspersed}} with sterile tissue. The asci are cylindrical to spherical, indehiscent (not splitting <b>open</b> at <b>maturity),</b> and sometimes stain blue in iodine. Ascospores are hyaline to pale brown, spherical, and uninucleate.|$|R
50|$|Over {{much of its}} range, it is fire-adapted to stand-replacing wildfires, {{with the}} cones {{remaining}} closed for many years (clausa = closed), until a natural forest fire kills the mature trees and opens the cones. These then reseed the burnt ground. Some populations differ in having cones that <b>open</b> at <b>maturity,</b> with seed dispersal not relying on fires.|$|R
50|$|The single {{inflorescence}} grows extremely fast, {{and reaches}} 0.9-3 m tall, bearing hundreds of elliptical (bell shaped) white to purplish flowers 3 cm diameter on a densely branched panicle up to 70 cm broad, covering {{the upper half}} of the inflorescence. The fruit is a dry winged capsule, which splits <b>open</b> at <b>maturity</b> to release the seeds.|$|R
5000|$|The {{flower of}} this orchid closes after pollination, forming a papery capsule. [...] Yellow, brown, or black dust-sized seeds are {{produced}} in the capsule, which dries and splits <b>open</b> at <b>maturity,</b> releasing millions of seeds that are dispersed by wind or water. [...] However, the seeds only germinate upon infection by mycorrhizal fungus, and so few seeds mature into full plants.|$|R

50|$|It {{is a small}} {{evergreen}} tree, 4-12 m (rarely to 20 m) high, with a trunk up to 50 cm diameter. The {{leaves are}} scale-like, 2-6 mm long and 0.5 mm broad, arranged in decussate whorls of three on very slender shoots 0.7-1 mm diameter. The cones are globose, 1-2 cm diameter, with six triangular scales, which <b>open</b> at <b>maturity</b> to release the seeds.|$|R
50|$|Raphanus species grow as annual or {{biennial}} plants, with a taproot {{which is}} much enlarged in the cultivated radish. Unlike many other genera in the family Brassicaceae, Raphanus has indehiscent fruit that do not split <b>open</b> at <b>maturity</b> to reveal the seeds. The genus is native to Asia, but its members can now be found worldwide. Growing wild, they are regarded as invasive species in many regions.|$|R
50|$|The {{flowers are}} irregularly shaped. It has five {{conspicuous}} sepals, bright dark blue or purplish, with the rear sepal elongated into a spur. The inconspicuous petals occur in two pairs. The lower pair is oblong and blue-purple, the upper pair oblique and white. Seeds are produced in several dry, many-seeded fruits that split <b>open</b> at <b>maturity</b> {{on only one}} side. The species flowers from April through May.|$|R
50|$|The cones {{may either}} <b>open</b> at <b>maturity</b> {{to release the}} seeds, or remain closed for several years, only opening after the parent tree is killed in a wildfire, {{allowing}} the seeds to colonise the bare ground exposed by the fire. The male cones are 3-4 mm long, and release pollen in February-March. In most of its natural environment rainfalloccurs with more quantity in summer.|$|R
50|$|The cupule holds {{and protects}} the fruit during its growth and maturation. In some genera (e.g. Lithocarpus, Quercus), it only partly {{encloses}} the single nut, while in others (e.g. Castanea, Fagus), it fully encloses {{the two or}} more nuts, and splits <b>open</b> at <b>maturity</b> into four valves to release the nuts. It {{is derived from the}} vegetative part of the flower (its attachment {{to the rest of the}} plant).|$|R
50|$|The {{indehiscent}} fruit are 4 to 5 mm long, 2.5 mm wide. They {{usually do not}} <b>open</b> at <b>maturity</b> to release seed. These thin-walled fruit have two internal capsules, and support seed dormancy. Placentation is apical, the style is 5 to 6 mm long. The plant regenerates from the base after fire or physical damage. However, seedlings have been observed after fire. Hybrids with Kunzea capitata have been recorded.|$|R
50|$|Geastrum fornicatum, {{commonly}} known as the acrobatic earthstar or the arched earthstar, is an inedible species of mushroom in the family Geastraceae. Like other earthstar mushrooms, the thick outer skin splits <b>open</b> at <b>maturity</b> to expose the spore sac to the elements; the specific epithet fornicatum (Latin for 'arched' or 'vaulted') refers to the arched shape of the rays which extend downwards to rest on the mycelial sac and elevate the spore sac.|$|R
2500|$|The {{species is}} monoecious, with pollen and seed cones {{on the same}} plant. The seed cones are ovoid, [...] long, with 15–25 spirally {{arranged}} scales; pollination is in late winter with maturation about 8–9 months after. Each cone scale bears three to seven seeds, each seed [...] long and [...] broad, with two wings [...] wide. The seeds are released when the cone scales dry out and <b>open</b> at <b>maturity.</b> The pollen cones are ovular and [...] long.|$|R
50|$|Plantago ovata is {{an annual}} herb that grows to {{a height of}} 30 - 46 cm. Leaves are opposite, linear or linear {{lanceolate}} 1 x 19 cm. The root system has a well-developed tap root with few fibrous secondary roots. A large number of flowering shoots arise {{from the base of}} the plant. Flowers are numerous, small, and white. Plants flower about 60 days after planting. The seeds are enclosed in capsules that <b>open</b> at <b>maturity.</b>|$|R
50|$|Spores are elliptical, hyaline, with small, fine warts on the surface, {{and have}} {{dimensions}} of 12-14 x 7-8 µm. They are biguttulate, containing two oil droplets {{at either end}} of the spore. The asci are 250-300 x 10-12 µm. Like other Pezizales, the asci <b>open</b> at <b>maturity</b> by means of an apical, lid-like flap of tissue termed an operculum. The paraphyses are club-shaped, filled with violet granules, and have bent tips; they are up to 7 µm wide.|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{much of its}} range, {{lodgepole}} pine (Pinus contorta Dougl.) produces serotinous cones. Because of a resinous bond between the cone scales, serotinous cones do not <b>open</b> at <b>maturity.</b> When subjected to temperatures of 45 to 50 degrees C. (or even higher), the bond breaks, the cones are free to open, and stored seed is released. Wildfires cause cones to open and cones {{on or near the}} ground are opened by normal summer soil surface temperatures (Crossley, 1956; Lotan, 1964) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{fruits of}} Polylepis are {{essentially}} achenes {{composed of the}} floral cup fused to the ovary. Fruits of all species are indehiscent (they do not <b>open</b> at <b>maturity)</b> and one seeded. The surface of the fruit of different species has ridges, knobs, spines or wings. There are no definite sites for the placement of these different types of protrusions that appear irregularly over the surface. The type of protrusion, wings verses spines, or knobs versus wings, is useful for distinguishing between species.|$|R
50|$|The {{leaves are}} needle-like, in fascicles (bundles) {{of two and}} three mixed together, and from 7 - 11 cm long. The cones are 4 - 7 cm long, with thin scales with a {{transverse}} keel and a short prickle. They <b>open</b> at <b>maturity</b> but are persistent. Shortleaf pine seedlings develop a persistent J-shaped crook near the ground surface. Axillary and other buds form near the crook and initiate growth if the upper stem is killed by fire or is severed.|$|R
5000|$|The spores of Rhizina undulata are [...] (fuse-shaped), apiculate, {{minutely}} verricose at maturity, {{with one}} or two oil drops, and have dimensions of 30-40 by 8-11 µm. The asci are roughly cylindrical, and 250-280 by 14-18 µm. Like most other Pezizales, the asci <b>open</b> at <b>maturity</b> by means of an apical, lid-like flap of tissue termed an operculum. The paraphyses are slightly club-shaped, tips encrusted with tubular setae, thin-walled, brown, aseptate and parallel-sided, tapering to a blunt point, and are 7-11 µm wide.|$|R
50|$|Hickories are {{deciduous}} {{trees with}} pinnately compound leaves and large nuts. Hickory flowers are small, yellow-green catkins produced in spring. They are wind-pollinated and self-incompatible. The fruit is a globose or oval nut, 2 - 5 cm long and 1.5 - 3 cm diameter, enclosed in a four-valved husk, which splits <b>open</b> at <b>maturity.</b> The nut shell is thick and bony in most species, and thin in a few, notably the pecan (C. illinoinensis); it {{is divided into}} two halves, which split apart when the seed germinates.|$|R
50|$|The cones are slender, 10 to 18 mm long, and 4 to 5 mm broad, with 8 to 12 (rarely 14) thin, {{overlapping}} scales. They {{are green}} to yellow-green, ripening brown in fall {{about six months}} after pollination, and <b>open</b> at <b>maturity</b> to shed the seeds. The seeds are 4 to 5 mm long and 1 mm broad, with a narrow papery wing down each side. The pollen cones are 3 to 4 mm long, red or purple at first, and shed yellow pollen in spring.|$|R
50|$|Abies fraseri {{is a small}} {{evergreen}} {{coniferous tree}} typically growing between 30 and 50 feet (10-15 m) tall, but rarely to 80 ft (25 m), with a trunk diameter of 16 to 20 inches (40-50 cm), but rarely 30 in (75 cm). The crown is conical, with straight branches either horizontal or angled upward at 40° from the trunk; it is dense when the tree is young and more <b>open</b> in <b>maturity.</b> The bark is thin, smooth, grayish brown, and has numerous resinous blisters on juvenile trees, becoming fissured and scaly in maturity.|$|R
50|$|It is an {{herbaceous}} perennial plant {{growing from}} tuberous roots, with stems 40-150 cm tall. The leaves are linear, 50-90 cm long and 1-2.8 cm broad. The flowers are 5-12 cm across, orange-red, with a pale central line on each tepal; they are produced from early summer through late autumn on scapes of ten through twenty flowers, {{with the individual}} flowers' opening successively, each one only lasting one day. The fruit is a three-valved capsule 2-2.5 cm long and 1.2-1.5 cm broad which splits <b>open</b> at <b>maturity</b> to release the seeds.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} monoecious, with pollen and seed cones {{on the same}} plant. The seed cones are ovoid, 15 - 32 mm long, with 15-25 spirally {{arranged}} scales; pollination is in late winter with maturation about 8-9 months after. Each cone scale bears three to seven seeds, each seed 3 - 4 mm long and 0.5 mm broad, with two wings 1 mm wide. The seeds are released when the cone scales dry out and <b>open</b> at <b>maturity.</b> The pollen cones are ovular and 4 - 6 mm long.|$|R
50|$|The {{leaves are}} alternate, ovate to lanceolate, {{often with a}} toothed or lobed margin. The flowers are large, conspicuous, trumpet-shaped, with five or more petals, color from white to pink, red, orange, peach, yellow or purple, and from 4-18 cm broad. Flower color in certain species, such as H. mutabilis and H. tiliaceus, changes with age. The fruit is a dry five-lobed capsule, {{containing}} several seeds in each lobe, which are released when the capsule dehisces (splits <b>open)</b> at <b>maturity.</b> It is of red and white colours. It {{is an example of}} complete flowers.|$|R
5000|$|Onygena equina, {{commonly}} known as the horn stalkball, is a species of fungus in the family Onygenaceae. The fungus grows on putrefying hooves and horns, and can digest the keratin in those substrates. Fruit bodies are small and white, with thick stipes supporting a [...] "head" [...] shaped like a flattened sphere. The skin, or peridium, of the head appears powdery or like a white crust, and breaks <b>open</b> in <b>maturity,</b> falling off in irregular pieces to expose the pale reddish-brown powdery spores within. The fungus is known from Europe and North America.|$|R
