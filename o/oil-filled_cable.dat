50|$|The {{high-voltage}} cable of the Kontek is implemented as paper-isolated <b>oil-filled</b> <b>cable</b> with two copper conductors with {{a cross section}} of 800 mm2 permanently joined in parallel. For better monitoring of the oil, the land sections of the Kontek cable are divided in sections of approx. 8 km, which are separated by oil-impermeable sockets from each other. In the proximity of these sockets - at some distance from the cable route - there are automatic stations for the monitoring of the oil pressure, the oil temperature and other operating parameters of the cable. For practical reasons, the 45 km long submarine cable section through the Baltic Sea between Germany and Denmark was implemented as a single oil-filled section without sockets. As electrode cables of the Kontek, on the German and on the Danish side, commercial plastic-isolated 17 kV-cables are used.|$|E

40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{investigation of}} the influence of gas pressure on the electrical breakdown of thin oil, as used in <b>oil-filled</b> <b>cables,</b> was carried out at gas pres-sure between about 5 x 10 - ~ mm Hg and 1000 mm Hg. The test cell consisted of a glass container enclosing a platinum sphere gap (0. 5 ram). Tests were carried out at ambient temperature. The results of this investigation showed that the dielectric strength of the oil is absolutely independent of the gas pres-sure, provided a perfect equil ibrium is reached between the gas dissolved in the oil and the free gas remaining in the cell above the oil surface. The inf luence of dissolved gas on the dielectr ic strength of oil has been discussed often and some data have been publ ished giv ing the re lat ion be-tween oil dielectr ic s t rength and gas pressure (1, 2).

40|$|The {{assessment}} of the suitability of cables of 6 â€“ 110 kV with XLPE insulation in comparison with cables of the same voltage but possessing paper-oil insulation has been fulfilled {{on the basis of}} the criterion of reduced costs. Thus, the comparison was undertaken between cables of various design and material of insulation: three-core paper insulated ones vs. three-core XLPE insulated ones; three-core paper-insulated ones vs. solid wires with XLPE insulation; single-core <b>oil-filled</b> <b>cables</b> of 110 kV with paper insulation vs. solid wires of 110 kV with XLPE insulation. The increase in long-term permissible current loads for cables with XLPE insulation because of the larger permissible temperature of heating in comparison with cables with paper-oil insulation complies with as would increase in the cross-sectional area of cable cores (equal to 0. 61 from the original) and therefore reduces the cost of the cable by reducing the cost of manufacture of conductors. The reduced costs of the construction and operation of cable lines with XLPE insulation (accounting the increase in the cost of a cable 1. 2 and 2 times as compared with the cost of a cable with three-core insulation), despite the decline in the cost of manufacture of conductors and the reduced annual operating costs (9 % and 17 % respectively of cable lines of voltage of up to 35 kV and 110 kV), occurred to be more than the reduced costs of the construction and operation of cable lines with paper insulation. Currently the cost of one meter of cable with XLPE insulation is less than the cost of cables of AAB, CASB, AASv types of a voltage of 10 kV with aluminium cores, that ensures their undeniable efficacy. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} of the suitability of cables of 6 â€“ 110 kW with XLPE insulation in comparison with cables of the same voltage but possessing paper-oil insulation has been fulfilled {{on the basis of}} the method of multi-objective optimization that makes it possible to account not only the quantitative characteristics (of reduced costs), but also qualitative ones. As an indicator of the reliability of the cable line the maximum mean time to failure (the value inversely proportional to the parameter of succession of failures), which is an order more for cable lines with XLPE insulation than for cable lines with paper insulation, is adopted. A comprehensive {{assessment of}} the convenience of installation of cable lines revealed that the installation of cable with XLPE insulation features a 1. 2 â€“ 1. 6 times easier installation as compared to three-wire (voltage 10 kW) and 1. 4 times easier installation as compared to single-core <b>oil-filled</b> <b>cables</b> (voltage of 110 kW). The efficacy of the cables 6 â€“ 110 kW with XLPE insulation is proved on the basis on the method of multi-objective optimization, that took into account as the costs for the construction and operation of cable lines and the reliability of its operation, ease of its installation and other quality indicators. If the goals taken into account are considered as equally important, the polyethylene-insulated cables for a voltage of 10 â€“ 110 kW is more efficient as compared to three-wire (voltage 10 kW) and solid (110 kW) cables with paper insulation. Herewith, the cost of the cable with XLPE insulation may exceed the cost of cable with paper insulation up to two times. If the most important aim is to provide the minimum reduced costs for the construction and operation of the cable line, the use of cables with XLPE insulation for voltage of 10 kW is most advisable in individual cases. </p...|$|R
40|$|Forced-cooled {{systems for}} <b>oil-filled</b> pipe-type <b>cable</b> {{circuits}} {{have recently been}} considered. In such systems the conduction resistance through the paper insulation of the cables is the limiting thermal resistance. Assuming bilateral symmetry, steady-state conditions, and two-dimensional heat transfer, a FORTRAN IV computer program was written to solve the heat conduction problem in the cable insulation for arbitrary configurations of a three-cable system. For a steel pipe, a cable system is most susceptible to overheating in the equilateral configuration with the three cables touching. Proximity effects are very significant in forced cooling, especially when cables are not provided with a copper tape under the insulation moisture seal assembly, accounting {{for as much as}} 21 % of the total oil temperature rise between refrigeration stations. This figure, however, is reduced to 8 % when 0. 005 inch thick copper tape is present. Forced cooling of underground electric power transmission lines, pt. 2 Consolidated Edison Co. of New Yor...|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} {{submarine}} power cables is {{the transport of}} electric current at high voltage. The electric core is a concentric assembly of inner conductor, electric insulation and protective layers. The conductor is made from copper or aluminum wires, the latter material having a small but increasing market share. Conductor sizes â‰¤ 1200 are most common, but sizes â‰¥ 2400 mm2 have been made occasionally. For voltages â‰¥ 12 kV the conductors are round. Three different types of electric insulation around the conductor are mainly used today.Cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) is used up to 420 kV system voltage. It is produced by extrusion in insulation thickness of up to about 30 mm. 36 kV class cables have only 5.5 - 8 mm insulation thickness. Certain formulations of XLPE insulation {{can also be used}} for DC.Low-pressure <b>oil-filled</b> <b>cables</b> have an insulation lapped from paper strips. The entire cable core is impregnated with a low-viscosity insulation fluid (mineral oil or synthetic). A central oil channel in the conductor facilitates oil flow when the cable gets warm. Rarely used in submarine cables due to oil pollution risk at cable damage. Is used up to 525 kV.Mass-impregnated cables have also a paper-lapped insulation but the impregnation compound is highly viscous and does not exit when the cable is damaged. MI insulation can be used for massive HVDC cables up to 525 kV. Cables â‰¥ 52 kV are equipped with an extruded lead sheath to prevent water intrusion. No other materials have been accepted so far. The lead alloy is extruded onto the insulation in long lengths (over 50 km is possible). In this stage the product is called cable core. In single-core cables the core is surrounded by a concentric armoring. In three-core cables, three cable cores are laid-up in a spiral configuration before the armoring is applied.The armouring consists most often of steel wires, soaked in bitumen for corrosion protection. Since the alternating magnetic field in ac cables causes losses in the armoring those cables are sometimes equipped with non-magnetic metallic materials (stainless steel, copper, brass). Modern three-core cables, e.g. for the interconnection of offshore wind turbines) carry often optical fibers for data transmission or temperature measurement.|$|R

40|$|Contamination {{of oil in}} low-pressure, <b>oil-filled,</b> paper-insulated, {{high-voltage}} <b>cables</b> {{connected to}} the high-pressure chambers of gas-insulated switchgear, due to the leakage of SF 6 gas, have often been reported by electric power utilities. As a consequence this contamination can impair not only the dielectric behavior of oil and oil-paper composite but also the dielectric integrity of adjoining termination. This experimental investigation explores the impact of trace amounts of SF 6 gas in oil on its dielectric strength under the power frequency and lightning impulses. The results show that minor leakages of SF 6 gas improve the power frequency dielectric strength of oil. However, longer contact of gas with oil can significantly reduce it both under the power frequency {{as well as the}} lightning impulses of both polarities.

40|$|The worldâ€™s first {{commercial}} High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission link {{was built in}} 1954 between the Swedish mainland and the island of Gotland. At that time, it was proved that HVDC transmission is technically feasible. Since then, HVDC cable systems have been used worldwide in electrical energy transportation. Most HVDC installations in use around the world today, use paper-insulated, <b>oil-filled</b> type <b>cables.</b> Extruded dielectric cables with cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) {{has long been the}} preferred solution in HVAC applications due to a combination of low material and processing costs, reliability and appropriate mechanical and electrical properties. However, polymeric HVDC cables suffer greatly from space charge accumulation during dc voltage application and from â€˜lowâ€™ depletion rate of accumulated space charge when the external field is removed. As a result, considerable modifications of the electric field distribution with respect to the geometric Laplacian field occur, especially in case of voltage polarity inversion. This may cause insulation degradation and premature breakdown. Manufacturers are trying to tackle the problems related to space charge phenomena by introducing additives to the insulation or semicon layers. The development of new polymeric materials with improved performance under dc electrical stress requires a thorough investigation of the properties governing charge injection, transport and trapping. Particularly mobility and trap depth distribution are very useful to describe and compare the behavior of different materials from the view point of charge dynamics and field modification. In this thesis, different polymeric mini-cables are examined under DC stresses with regard to their space charge dynamics. Two different types of XLPE insulation and four types of semi-conductive layers compose eight different combinations of mini-cables. The specimens are subjected to space charge measurements and conduction current measurements in order for their electric field thresholds to be determined. The threshold for space charge trapping is an important parameter for the design of insulation systems subjected to dc electrical fields. If the applied electric field exceeds the threshold, charge injected from the electrodes can accumulate in traps located at the interface with electrodes and in the insulation bulk. Furthermore, depolarization characteristics obtained at high electric fields and temperatures, are used in order to further investigate the performance of the mini-cables with respect to their apparent trap-controlled mobilities and trap depths, including the space charge distribution along the trap levels. The main goal of this thesis is to evaluate how the composition of insulation and semi-conductive layers affects the space charge dynamics in polymeric mini-cables.
