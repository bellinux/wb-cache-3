50|$|In the United States, the SPAC public <b>{{offering}}</b> <b>structure</b> {{is governed}} by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A public offering for a SPAC is typically filed with the SEC under an S-1 registration statement (or an F-1 for a foreign private issuer) and is classified by the SEC under SIC code 6770 - Blank Checks. Full disclosure of the SPAC structure, target industries or geographic regions, management team biographies, share ownership, potential conflicts of interest and risk factors are standard topics included in the S-1 registration statement. It is believed that the SEC has studied SPACs {{to determine whether they}} require special regulations to ensure that these vehicles are not abused like blind pool trusts and blank-check corporations have been over the years. Many believe that SPACs do have corporate governance mechanisms in place to protect shareholders. SPACs listed on the American Stock Exchange are required to be Sarbanes-Oxley compliant {{at the time of the}} offering including such mandatory requirements as a majority of the board of directors being independent and audit and compensation committees.|$|E

40|$|Las madres de hijos con síndrome de Asperger suelen vivenciar elevados niveles de estrés parental, incluso más que la mayoría de madres. Además, la percepción sobre sus propias competencias parentales tiende a ser disminuida. La {{literatura}} muestra una relación inversa entre dichos procesos, los cuales no han sido investigados en este grupo de madres en nuestro medio. Por ello, el presente estudio buscó identificar si existe tal relación y cuál era su naturaleza. Las 33 madres que conformaron la muestra respondieron al Índice de Estrés Parental y a la Escala de Competencia Parental Percibida. Se hallaron tres correlaciones significativas; una inversa y dos directas, respectivamente. Las madres que sentían la relación con su hijo como una escasa fuente de refuerzo positivo, se percibían menos competentes para brindarle estructura y guía. De otro lado, las madres de hijos con menor habilidad adaptativa, brindaban mayor tiempo y espacio para conversar y aclarar dudas. Por otra parte, las madres de hijos con escasa expresión de afectos positivos, percibían estar más adaptadas al hecho de tener un hijo. Respecto a variables sociodemográficas, las madres divorciadas o separadas reportaron menor capacidad para la crianza, mayor aislamiento, más síntomas depresivos, menor apoyo del padre, y menor competencia parental general. Similarmente, las madres de hijos únicos reportaron mayor aislamiento, mayor restricción debido al rol materno, más síntomas depresivos, menor apoyo del padre, y menor adaptación al hecho de ser madre. Los resultados se discuten e interpretan reconociendo la baja confiabilidad de ciertas sub-escalas de los instrumentos. Mothers {{of children}} with Asperger’s syndrome tend to experience high levels of parenting stress, even more than most mothers. In addition, their perception of their own parenting competence is usually diminished. Literature review shows an inverse correlation between these processes, which have not been studied in this group of mothers in our society. Taking that into consideration, the current investigation intended to identify if such relation existed and what its nature was. The sample consisted of 33 mothers who answered the Parental Stress Index and the Perceived Parenting Competence Scale (Escala de Competencia Parental Percibida). The results indicated three significant correlations; one inverse and two direct, respectively. First, mothers who felt their relationship with their child was a scarce source of positive reinforcement, felt less competent in <b>offering</b> <b>structure</b> and guidance. Second, mothers {{of children with}} less adaptive skills, offered more time and space to talk and solve doubts. Third, mothers of children who presented low expression of positive affects, felt more adapted to the fact of raising a child. Regarding sociodemographic variables, mothers who were divorced or separated reported less parenting ability, more isolation, more depressive symptoms, less support from the father, and less overall parenting competence. Similarly, mothers of an only child reported more isolation, more restriction related to the maternal role, more depressive symptoms, less support from the father, and less adaptation to the fact of being a mother.

40|$|The rapid {{progress}} of multi/many-core architectures has caused data-intensive parallel applications {{not yet fully}} optimized to deliver the best performance. In the advent of concurrent programming, frameworks <b>offering</b> <b>structured</b> patterns have alleviated developers' burden adapting such applications to multithreaded architectures. While some of these patterns are implemented using synchronization primitives, others avoid them by means of lock-free data mechanisms. However, lock-free programming is not straightforward, ensuring an appropriate use of their interfaces can be challenging, since different memory models plus instruction reordering at compiler/processor levels can interfere in the occurrence of data races. The benefits of race detectors are formidable in this sense; however, they may emit false positives if are unaware of the underlying lock-free structure semantics. To mitigate this issue, this paper extends ThreadSanitizer, a race detection tool, with the semantics of 2 lock-free data structures: the single-producer/single-consumer and the multiple-producer/multiple-consumer queues. With it, {{we are able to}} drop false positives and detect potential semantic violations. The experimental evaluation, using different queue implementations on a set of Î¼ benchmarks and real applications, demonstrates {{that it is possible to}} reduce, on average, 60 % the number of data race warnings and detect wrong uses of these structures...|$|R

For example, the use of synchronization mechanisms in multithreaded applications is essential on shared-cache multi-core architectures.

The benefits of race detectors are formidable in this sense, nevertheless if lock-free data structures with no high-level atomics are used, they may emit false positives. In this paper, we extend the ThreadSani- tizer race detection tool {{in order to support}} semantics of the general Single-Producer/Single-Consumer (SPSC) lock- free parallel queue and to detect benign data races where it was correctly used. To perform our analysis, we leverage the FastFlow SPSC bounded lock-free queue implementa- tion to test our extensions over a set of μ-benchmarks and real applications on a dual-socket Intel Xeon CPU E 5 - 2695 platform.

The World Health Organisation (WHO 2010) says that regular, moderate intensity physical activity can have significant health benefits, such as reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, colon and breast cancer, and depression. But there is also evidence that exercise can have more specific health benefits for people with dementia, for example by improving quality of life, neurocognitive function and affective symptoms (mood), and that it can possibly influence the rate of cognitive decline (Erikson 2011; Scarmeas et al 2011). This led to a collaboration between the Liverpool-based exercise service Liveability and a European research project called Innovate Dementia to evaluate the role of exercise for people with dementia.

50|$|The {{traditional}} apprenticeship framework's {{purpose was}} to provide a supply of young people seeking to enter work-based learning via apprenticeships by <b>offering</b> <b>structured</b> high-value learning and transferable skills and knowledge. Apprenticeship training was enabled by linking industry with local technical colleges and professional engineering institutions. The apprenticeship framework offered a clear pathway and competency outcomes that addressed the issues facing the industry sector and specific companies. This system was in place since the 1950s. The system provided young people with an alternative to staying in full-time education post- 16/18 to gain purely academic qualifications without work-based learning. The apprenticeship system of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s provided the necessary preparation for young people to qualify as a Craft trade (Machinist, Toolmaker, Fitter, Plumber, Welder, Mechanic, Millwright etc.), or Technician (quality inspector, draughtsman, designer, planner, work study, programmer), or Technician Engineer (tool design, product design, methods, stress and structural analysis, machine design etc.) and even enabled a path to a fully qualified Chartered Engineer in a specific discipline (Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, Aeronautical, Chemical, Building, Structural, Manufacturing etc.). The Chartered Engineer qualification was usually achieved aged 28 and above. Apprentices undertook a variety of job roles in numerous shop floor and office technical functions to assist the work of master craftsmen, technicians, engineers, and managers in the design, development, manufacture and maintenance of products and production systems.|$|R
