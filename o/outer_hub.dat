40|$|In this thesis, a novel {{torsion spring}} design {{for use in}} knee {{prostheses}} and exoskeletons is presented and analyzed. The planar spring design features an <b>outer</b> <b>hub</b> and an inner hub, which are connected by slender beams and store torsion energy in beam bending. The beams are fixed to the <b>outer</b> <b>hub</b> on one end and attached to the inner hub by a pin and slot on the other. The modeled spring design is capable of deflecting ± [pi]/ 6 radians, higher than any existing planar torsion spring designs, and is capable of providing 100 N-m of torque. The maraging steel spring is predicted to have a total diameter of 0. 112 meters, width of 0. 005 meters, and mass of 98 grams. With this form factor, the planar spring design provides a more compact alternative to elastic elements currently used in series elastic actuators. From the presented models, the design dimensions, material, and slot geometry can be parametrized to design springs that meet specific requirements for different applications. In addition to quantifying performance, the models presented provide the foundation for further weight, efficiency, and performance optimization. by Thuan D. Doan. Thesis: S.

40|$|Abstract: The {{elastic stress}} {{concentrations}} {{developed from the}} keyless frictionless static press-fit of a shaft into a hub are addressed. Two configurations are examined, namely (a) an infi-nitely long solid shaft press-fitted into a hollow hub with bore rounded edges, and (b) a shaft with filleted extremity, partially inserted into a hub. Derived from an analytical approach, a normalizing parameter is proposed that accounts for the combined effects on the stress con-centrations of the fillet radius, the shaft radius, the interference, and Young’s modulus. With the aid of finite elements, various design charts are compiled that report the elastic stress con-centrations within the hub versus the proposed normalizing parameter. Each curve is valid for a fixed ratio of inner to <b>outer</b> <b>hub</b> radii...|$|E

40|$|The {{elastic stress}} {{concentrations}} are addressed that are {{developed from the}} keyless frictionless press fit of a shaft subjected to bending into a hub with rounded bore edges. Derived from a formal modeling of the title problem {{in terms of an}} integral equation, a set of normalized parameters is proposed that accounts for the combined effects on the hub stress concentration of the fillet radius, the shaft radius, the <b>hub</b> <b>outer</b> radius, the <b>hub</b> axial length, the interference, the Young's modulus, and the bending couple. A numerical validation of the normalized parameters is presented. With the aid of Finite Elements, various design charts are compiled that (a) forecast the bending couple initiating the detachment between the shaft and the hub, and (b) report the elastic stress concentrations within the hub versus the proposed normalized parameters in the absence of shaft–hub detachment. Such charts assist the designer in dimensioning an interference fit {{in the presence of a}} bending couple...|$|R

A planar two-link flexible arm with rotary joints subject only to bending deformations {{in the plane}} of motion is considered (torsional effects are neglected).

The device is composed of an identical pair of cylindrical hub assemblies connected at their inner faces by a spring loaded hinge; each hub assembly having a structural half column attached to its <b>outer</b> end. Each <b>hub</b> assembly has a spring loading locking ring member movably attached adjacent to its inner face and includes a latch member for holding the locking ring in a rotated position subject to the force of its spring. Each hub assembly also has a hammer member for releasing the latch on the opposing hub assembly when the hub assemblies are rotated together. The spring loaded hinge connecting the hub assemblies rotates the hub assemblies and attached structural half columns together bringing the inner faces of the opposing hub assemblies into contact with one another...|$|R
40|$|Relay (or remote) {{synchronization}} {{between two}} not directly connected oscillators {{in a network}} is an important feature allowing distant coordination. In this work, we report a systematic study of this phenomenon in multiplex networks, where inter-layer synchronization occurs between distant layers mediated by a relay layer {{that acts as a}} transmitter. We show that this transmission can be extended to higher order relay configurations, provided symmetry conditions are preserved. By first order perturbative analysis, we identify the dynamical and topological dependencies of relay synchronization in a multiplex. We find that the relay synchronization threshold is considerably reduced in a multiplex configuration, and that such synchronous state is mostly supported by the lower degree nodes of the <b>outer</b> layers, while <b>hubs</b> can be de-multiplexed without affecting overall coherence. Finally, we experimentally validated the analytical and numerical findings by means of a multiplex of three layers of electronic circuits. the analytical and numerical findings by means of a multiplex of three layers of electronic circuits...|$|R
40|$|The peak contact {{stresses}} {{are addressed}} that are {{developed from the}} frictionless press fit of a shaft subjected to bending into an elastically similar hub with bore rounded edges. The non-linear behavior of this progressive contact is addressed by scaling a local solution available from the literature, {{with the aid of}} intermediate, auxiliary problems extracted from the fracture mechanics realm. The title problem being linear on the global domain with both the bending couple and the interference, this problem is solved by combining the FE forecasts obtained for two separate load cases, i. e. a) the interference alone and, b) the bending couple alone. Such results are expressed in terms of a) stress intensity factors for the auxiliary FM problems, and b) hoop strain component, as sampled in the proximity of the indenting edge for both the mating members. Design formulae for the contact stresses are proposed, that account for various normalized geometrical parameters, such as the <b>outer</b> to inner <b>hub</b> radii ratio, the radius of the hub bore fillet, and the contact length. Comprehensive coefficient tables are provided as well. Finally, an error analysis for the proposed method is presented...|$|R
40|$|A {{bascule bridge}} {{is a type}} of movable bridge that can be opened or closed to {{facilitate}} the movement of water-borne traffic such as ships and yachts. Trunnion-Hub-Girder (THG) assembly plays a role as a fulcrum in the bascule bridge. To make the fulcrum, the trunnion is shrink-fitted into the hub, and then the trunnion-hub assembly is shrink-fitted into the girder. Hundreds of thousands of dollars could be lost due to failures during this step. Crack formations in the hubs of various Florida bascule bridges during assembly led the Florida Department of Transportation to commission a project with USF professors to investigate. Finite elements method (ANSYS package) is employed to model the THG assembly procedure and solve for the critical crack length and critical stress in this transient thermal structural problem. Design of experiments (DOE) is used with different cooling processes and the geometrical dimensions of the THG assembly to find the sensitivity of these parameters on the outputs. The influence of the <b>hub</b> <b>outer</b> diameter and the radial interference (between the trunnion and hub) is at different levels on the critical crack length and the stress ratio as it is dependent on fulcrum geometry. If we include four staged cooling methods as follow Type 1 : liquid nitrogen Type 2 : dry-ice/ alcohol bath followed by liquid nitrogen Type 3 : refrigerated air chamber followed by liquid nitrogen Type 4 : refrigerated air chamber followed by dry-ice/alcohol bath and then by liquid nitrogenthe cooling type factor contributes the most to both critical crack length (up to 79 %) and the stress ratio (up to 84 %) in the TH assembling procedures in all three considered bascule bridges. The staged cooling procedure type 2, which is, immersing the TH assembly into the dry ice medium, followed by immersing the TH set into the liquid nitrogen, give larger critical crack length (up to 400 %) and stress ratio (up to 87 %) compared to the case that used only liquid nitrogen...|$|R
40|$|In {{work package}} 2. 2. 4 "NLG Low-Noise Enabling Technologies" of the Clean Sky GRA LNC project, the Fraunhofer Institute proposes hubcaps for {{reducing}} noise from a {{nose landing gear}} (NLG) as the most promising solution. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to prove the effect of the hubcaps experimentally and numerically. A simplified and 1 : 5 -scaled model of a NLG was first created by the rapid prototyping technique together with hubcaps that can cover both the <b>outer</b> and inner <b>hub</b> cavities. Noise radiated from various NLG configurations with and without hubcaps were measured during they were placed in the wind tunnel. In the configuration without hubcaps, two major noise peaks in addition to a continuous spectrum were observed in the direction parallel to the wheel axle. When the inner hubcaps were attached to the NLG, the levels of the peaks were significantly reduced. The outer caps have no effects on the noise reduction. Nearly the same noise spectrum as the original no-hubcap configuration was observed. Although the peaks were not clearly observed in the direction perpendicular to the axle, the same noise reduction could be recognized in the inner-hubcap configuration. In the numerical examination, a stationary CFD analysis with a k- 0 ́f turbulence model was first performed and a CAA analysis was then carried out based on Lighthill's aeroacoustic analogy after reconstructing a time-varying turbulent flow by a stochastic noise generation and radiation model. In the CAA analysis of the no-hubcap configuration, a strong fluctuation in the right and left inner hub cavities, where pressure is oscillating alternately, was observed. This fluctuation served as a dipole noise source whose direction is parallel to the wheel axle. The simulated spectrum of far field sound pressure in this direction has the peaks corresponding to the ones experimentally observed. In the hubcap configuration, the pressure fluctuation in the inner hubcap cavities was greatly reduced. Because of this, the noise peaks were well depressed. Due to the dipole characteristics of the noise source, no clear peaks were simulated in the far field spectrum in the direction perpendicular to the axle. In conclusion, the effectiveness of the inner hubcaps has been proved in the wind tunnel experiment and confirmed in the numerical analysis. The mechanism of noise reduction by the inner caps has also been clarified...|$|R
