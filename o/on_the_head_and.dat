5|$|Excepting for the head, snakes have imbricate scales, {{overlapping}} {{like the}} tiles on a roof. Snakes have rows of scales along the whole {{or part of}} their length and also many other specialised scales, either singly or in pairs, occurring <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{other regions of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|Nikolai Zarudny and Härms {{described}} a subspecies, rubripersonatus, from Baluchistan in 1902. This was {{described a}}s having a deeper reddish orange skin <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> a yellow-tipped dark bill. This has rarely been considered a valid subspecies but the intermediate pattern of bill colouration suggests intermixing of subspecies.|$|E

5|$|The impala has {{a special}} dental {{arrangement}} on the front lower jaw similar to the toothcomb seen in strepsirrhine primates, which is used during allogrooming to comb the fur <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> the neck and remove ectoparasites.|$|E
5|$|The juveniles’ {{markings}} {{follow a}} similar pattern to adult birds, but they are washed with a rusty brown <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> upper breast, and the back and wings are mottled buff or brown with prominent white tips. The young birds’ eyes are brown.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 review {{reported}} 46% of bites occurring on distal extremities of the limbs, 25% on proximal {{areas of}} limbs (upper arms and thighs), 21% on the trunk, and 7% {{on the head}} or neck. In some cases the same spider bites a victim multiple times. Historically, victims were often bitten on the genitalia, though this phenomenon disappeared as outhouses were superseded by plumbed indoor toilets. Conversely, bites <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> neck have increased with use of safety helmets and ear muffs. Precautions to avoid being bitten include wearing gloves and shoes while gardening, not leaving clothes on the floor, and shaking out gloves or shoes before putting them on. Also, children can be educated not to touch spiders.|$|E

5|$|A frog's skin is protective, has a {{respiratory}} function, {{can absorb}} water and helps control body temperature. It has many glands, particularly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> back, which often exude distasteful and toxic substances (granular glands). The secretion is often sticky and {{helps keep the}} skin moist, protects against the entry of moulds and bacteria, and make the animal slippery and more able to escape from predators. The skin is shed every few weeks. It usually splits {{down the middle of}} the back and across the belly, and the frog pulls its arms and legs free. The sloughed skin is then worked towards the head where it is quickly eaten.|$|E
5|$|Adult dragonflies hunt on {{the wing}} using their {{exceptionally}} acute eyesight and strong, agile flight. They are almost exclusively carnivorous, eating {{a wide variety of}} insects ranging from small midges and mosquitoes to butterflies, moths, damselflies, and smaller dragonflies. A large prey item is subdued by being bitten <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> is carried by the legs to a perch. Here, the wings are discarded and the prey usually ingested head first. A dragonfly may consume as much as a fifth of its body weight in prey per day.|$|E
5|$|At {{medium to}} close range, an adult red-throated loon in either {{breeding}} or non-breeding plumage is usually easily recognised. However, in certain light conditions, {{at certain times}} in its moulting cycle, or at greater distances, it may be mistaken for another species—most commonly the black-throated loon, but also occasionally the great crested grebe. It shows more white <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> neck than does the black-throated loon, and—provided it is not sitting low in the water—tends to show more white on the flanks as well. If it is sitting lower in the water, so that the white on the flanks is reduced to a patch on the rear flank (thus resembling {{the pattern of the}} black-throated loon), that patch tends to be less clearly defined than the comparative patch on the black-throated.|$|E

5|$|Gestation is {{typically}} six months long, after which a single calf is born. Newborn are a light yellow; infant males {{may have a}} black patch <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> the neck. Young are precocial - they can {{stand on their own}} soon after birth. Females can mate again after a month of parturition. Juveniles remain active and playful throughout the day. Juvenile males turn black gradually, darkening notably after the third year. The lifespan {{is typically}} 10 to 15 years.|$|E
5|$|In December 1923, {{while visiting}} the Winchester {{residence}} of W. A. Baker, a fellow {{director of the}} Winchester and Western Railroad, Cornwell was rendered unconscious after a large longcase clock in a hallway toppled over, striking him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> knocking him down. The longcase clock inflicted a severe wound {{to the back of}} Cornwell's head. He received first aid treatment from a physician present at the residence and was taken to his Winchester home where he regained consciousness.|$|E
5|$|In benign infections {{found in}} some wild and captive African elephants, these viruses can affect either the skin or the {{pulmonary}} system. In the former case, it produces small pinkish nodules <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> trunk in juveniles, which appear {{for a few weeks}} and then regress, suggesting an intermittently reactivated localized infection that mostly remains dormant. In the second case, it has been found in small white pulmonary nodules on necropsy of many asymptomatic adults. These are both characteristic of EEHV2, EEHV3 and EEHV6.|$|E

5|$|Some {{frogs and}} toads inflate {{themselves}} to make themselves look large and fierce, and some spadefoot toads (Pelobates spp) scream and leap towards the attacker. Giant salamanders of the genus Andrias, as well as Ceratophrine and Pyxicephalus frogs possess sharp teeth and are capable of drawing blood with a defensive bite. The blackbelly salamander (Desmognathus quadramaculatus) can bite an attacking common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis) {{two or three times}} its size <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> often manages to escape.|$|E
5|$|The Maine Coon {{is a long}} {{or medium}} haired cat. The coat is soft and silky, {{although}} texture may vary with coat color. The length is shorter <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> shoulders, and longer on the stomach and flanks with some cats having a lion-like ruff around their neck. Minimal grooming {{is required for the}} breed, compared to other long-haired breeds, as their coat is mostly self-maintaining owing to a light-density undercoat. The coat is subject to seasonal variation, with the fur being thicker in the winter and thinner during the summer.|$|E
5|$|The {{base coat}} of the jaguar is {{generally}} a tawny yellow, but can range to reddish-brown and black, {{for most of}} the body. However, the ventral areas are white. The cat is covered in rosettes for camouflage in the dappled light of its forest habitat. The spots vary over individual coats and between individual jaguars: rosettes may include one or several dots, and the shapes of the dots vary. The spots <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> neck are generally solid, as are those on the tail, where they may merge to form a band.|$|E

5|$|The {{body of the}} Izak {{catshark}} is {{firm and}} stout, tapering dramatically towards the tail. The head is very short, wide, and flattened, with a blunt snout. The horizontally oval eyes are placed high <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> have thick ridges beneath; each has a rudimentary nictitating membrane and {{is followed by a}} spiracle. The nostrils are preceded by triangular flaps of skin that almost reach the long, angular mouth. The mouth contains prominent papillae on both the roof and the floor, and lacks furrows at the corners. The upper and lower jaws contain on average 65 and 60 tooth rows respectively; each tooth is relatively large, with a narrow central cusp flanked by 1–2 smaller cusplets. There are five pairs of gill slits.|$|E
5|$|The newly hatched American white ibis {{is covered}} with violet down feathers, {{deepening}} to dark brown or black <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> wings. The chest is often bare and {{there can be a}} white tuft on the head. The irises are brown. The exposed skin is pinkish initially, apart from the tip of the bill which is dark gray, but turns gray within a few days of hatching. The bill is short and straight at birth and has an egg tooth which falls off between days five and nine, and develops three black rings from around day six, before turning gray by around six weeks of age. The gray to sandy gray brown juvenile plumage appears between weeks two and six, and face and bill become pink a few weeks later, while the legs remain gray. The irises have turned slate-gray by this stage. Once fledged, the juvenile American white ibis has largely brown plumage and only the rump, underwing and underparts are white. The legs become light orange. As it matures, white feathers begin appearing on the back and it undergoes a gradual molt to obtain the white adult plumage. This is mostly complete {{by the end of the}} second year, although some brown feathers persist <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> neck until the end of the third year. Juvenile birds take around two years to reach adult size and weight.|$|E
5|$|The tail is {{moderately}} {{short and}} does not have large thorn-like structures called dermal denticles that are normally found on skates. This lack of denticles distinguishes it from all but two species of skates that {{are found in the}} western Atlantic. Larger individuals do have three rows of smaller denticles on the tail, and mature females also possess denticles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> shoulders, and along the dorsal midbelt of the disk and tail. Denticles are completely absent on small individuals.|$|E
50|$|The slaty spinetail is {{typically}} 15 cm long, and weighs 18.5 g. It is a slender bird with a long, pointed wispy tail. The plumage is mainly dark grey-brown becoming dark grey <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> <b>The</b> crown <b>and</b> shoulder patches are rich rufous.|$|R
