There is a big variety of both original and alternative (cheaper) inks and print media for the consumers. But {{there is a question}} if the cheaper material provides also comparable printout quality. For this reason, it is important to test the properties of such inkjet printouts. There are several ways how to test the lightfastness of the printouts: long term storage under environmental conditions, or short, accelerated ageing tests. The stability of printouts is affected by many factors, such as ink-receiving layer, ink composition, UV and visible light intensity and air pollutants concentration in the environment. Some inkjet printouts exposed to light usually undergo surprisingly fast fading, but light is not the only dangerous condition for inkjet printout. The two types of test targets printed with dyebased inkjet inks on various paper types were subjected to both accelerated test in a xenon test chamber and light and environmental pollutants long-term test in a sunny indoor corridor. The values of light intensity were continuously monitored and samples properties were regularly measured with a spectrophotometer. Another type of testing included accelerated <b>ozone</b> <b>ageing</b> of inkjet dyes. The colour gamuts and gamut volumes were calculated from collected spectral data. Total colour difference E*ab was also evaluated, its increase served as a tool for finding the formal printout degradation rate constant. It was found out that the dyes in ink-receiving layers of printouts underwent significant degradation in all tested conditions. The degradation rate depended on the type of used print media. The reciprocity behaviour of printouts was also studied. Recent inkjet printouts testing miss some actual ISO norm which should show the way of effective lightfastness evaluation. One of the main aims of this work was to find some new and alternative ways of inkjet printouts lightfastness evaluation. The method of printed inks concentration determination from the test charts spectrophotometric measurements was also proposed...|$|E

5000|$|Nitrile rubber (NBR, HNBR, HSN): {{a common}} {{material}} for o-rings {{because of its}} good mechanical properties, its resistance to lubricants and greases, and its relatively low cost. The physical and chemical resistance properties of NBR materials {{are determined by the}} acrylonitrile (ACN) content of the base polymer: low content ensures good flexibility at low temperatures, but offers limited resistance to oils and fuels. As the ACN content increases, the low temperature flexibility reduces and the resistance to oils and fuels improves. Physical and chemical resistance properties of NBR materials are also affected by the cure system of the polymer. Peroxide-cured materials have improved physical properties, chemical resistance and thermal properties, as compared to sulfur-donor-cured materials. Standard grades of NBR are typically resistant to mineral oil-based lubricants and greases, many grades of hydraulic fluids, aliphatic hydrocarbons, silicone oils and greases and water to about 80 °C. NBR is generally not resistant to aromatic and chlorinated hydrocarbons, fuels with a high aromatic content, polar solvents, glycol-based brake fluids and non-flammable hydraulic fluids (HFD).

40|$|In this dissertation, {{results are}} {{presented}} of laboratory investigations and mathematical modeling efforts designed {{to better understand the}} interactions of ozone with surfaces. In the laboratory, carpet and duct materials were exposed to ozone and measured ozone uptake kinetics and the ozone induced emissions of volatile organic compounds. To understand the results of the experiments, mathematical methods were developed to describe dynamic indoor aldehyde concentrations, mass transport of reactive species to smooth surfaces, the equivalent reaction probability of whole carpet due to the surface reactivity of fibers and carpet backing, and <b>ozone</b> <b>aging</b> of surfaces. Carpets, separated carpet fibers, and separated carpet backing all tended to release aldehydes when exposed to ozone. Secondary emissions were mostly n-nonanal and several other smaller aldehydes. The pattern of emissions suggested that vegetable oils may be precursors for these oxidized emissions. Several possible precursors and experiments in which linseed and tung oils were tested for their secondary emission potential were discussed. Dynamic emission rates of 2 -nonenal from a residential carpet may indicate that intermediate species in the oxidation of conjugated olefins can significantly delay aldehyde emissions and act as reservoir for these compounds. The ozone induced emission rate of 2 -nonenal, a very odorous compound, can result in odorous indoor concentrations for several years. Surface ozone reactivity is a key parameter in determining the flux of ozone to a surface, is parameterized by the reaction probability, which is simply the probability that an ozone molecule will be irreversibly consumed when it strikes a surface. In laboratory studies of two residential and two commercial carpets, the ozone reaction probability for carpet fibers, carpet backing and the equivalent reaction probability for whole carpet were determined. Typically reaction probability values for these materials were 10 {sup {minus} 7 }, 10 {sup {minus} 5 }, and 10 {sup {minus} 5 } respectively. To understand how internal surface area influences the equivalent reaction probability of whole carpet, a model of ozone diffusion into and reaction with internal carpet components was developed. This was then used to predict apparent reaction probabilities for carpet. He combines this with a modified model of turbulent mass transfer developed by Liu, et al. to predict deposition rates and indoor ozone concentrations. The model predicts that carpet should have an equivalent reaction probability of about 10 {sup {minus} 5 }, matching laboratory measurements of the reaction probability. For both carpet and duct materials, surfaces become progressively quenched (aging), losing the ability to react or otherwise take up ozone. He evaluated the functional form of aging and find that the reaction probability follows a power function with respect to the cumulative uptake of ozone. To understand <b>ozone</b> <b>aging</b> of surfaces, he developed several mathematical descriptions of aging based on two different mechanisms. The observed functional form of aging is mimicked by a model which describes ozone diffusion with internal reaction in a solid. He shows that the fleecy nature of carpet materials in combination with the model of ozone diffusion below a fiber surface and internal reaction may explain the functional form and the magnitude of power function parameters observed due to ozone interactions with carpet. The ozone induced aldehyde emissions, measured from duct materials, were combined with an indoor air quality model to show that concentrations of aldehydes indoors may approach odorous levels. He shows that ducts are unlikely to be a significant sink for ozone due to the low reaction probability in combination with the short residence time of air in ducts...|$|R
40|$|Does ozone {{carryover}} aloft affect day-of-the-week phenomena? Given substantially {{limited and}} intermittent data aloft {{that are currently}} available, both in time and in space, we cannot resolve this question. As ozone levels have declined, the relative contribution of carryover may also have declined. However, day-of-week variations in the amounts and proportions of ozone precursors could have implications for day-of-week variations in ozone aloft that are not directly proportional to the day-of-week variations observed in surface ozone concentrations. If ozone formation at ground level is VOC-limited and ozone formation aloft is NOX-limited, the relative differences in VOC and NOX emissions from weekdays to weekends could result in ozone concentrations aloft being poorly related to the ozone concentrations measured at ground level.

We present laboratory studies of ice nucleation for immersion and deposition mode on <b>ozone</b> <b>aged</b> mineral dust particles for 233 T < 263 K. Heterogeneous ice nucleation of untreated kaolinite (Ka) and Arizona Test Dust (ATD) particles is compared to corresponding aged particles that are subjected to ozone concentrations of 0. 4 – 4. 3 ppmv in a stainless steel aerosol tank. The portable ice nucleation counter (PINC) and immersion chamber combined with the Zurich ice nucleation chamber (IMCA-ZINC) are used to conduct deposition and immersion mode measurements, respectively. Ice active fractions as well as ice active surface site densities (n s) are reported and observed to increase as a function of decreasing temperature. We present first results that demonstrate enhancement of the ice nucleation ability of aged mineral dust particles in both the deposition and immersion mode due to ageing. We also present the first results to show a suppression of heterogeneous ice nucleation activity without the condensation of a coating of (in) organic material. In immersion mode, low ozone exposed Ka particles showed enhanced ice activity requiring a median freezing temperature of 1. 5 K warmer than that of untreated Ka, whereas high ozone exposed ATD particles showed suppressed ice nucleation requiring a median freezing temperature of 3 K colder than that of untreated ATD. In deposition mode, low exposure Ka had ice active fractions of an order of magnitude higher than untreated Ka, whereas high ozone exposed ATD had ice active fractions up to a factor of 4 lower than untreated ATD.

For rubber reinforced composites, Resorcinol Formaldehyde Latex (RFL) is known as a fibre surface coating which is able to provide good adhesion between rubber and fibres. But the {{performance of}} this substance in many cases can be largely affected due to exposure of the coated fibres to air and light.

The effects of gaseous ozone exposure on development of post-harvest green and blue molds {Penicillium digitatum and Penicillium italicum) in artificially inoculated citrus fruit (104 cfu ml" 1) were evaluated. Oranges were pre-treated according with the following protocol: control (not washed), washing with ozonized water (0. 6 ppm), washing with chlorinated water (50 ppm). After the washing-pre-treatments, fruits were stored for 8 weeks at 5 °C and 90 - 95 % relative humidity in an intermittent ozone exposure (treatment) and in normal cold storage room (control). Gaseous ozone at 0. 25 ppm did not reduce Penicillium mold incidence in no-wash fruit, apparently the fungal structures in wounds remain protected from the oxidant effect of ozone.

Observed greenhouse gas concentrations, halogen concentrations, aerosol amounts, and sea surface temperatures are all specified in the model as time-varying fields. The results are compared with two experiments (time-slice runs) with constant forcings for the years 1960 and 2000, in which the sea surface temperatures are set to the same climatological values, aerosol concentrations are fixed at background levels, while greenhouse gas and halogen concentrations are set to the values for the relevant years. The time-slice runs indicate an increase in stratospheric water vapor from 1960 to 2000 due primarily to methane oxidation.

Our zonally resolved analysis at the 390 K potential temperature level reveals that not only (deseasonalized) ENSO-related temperature anomalies are confined to the tropical Pacific (180 – 300 °E) but also anomalous wave propagation and breaking, as quantified in terms of the Eliassen-Palm (EP) flux divergence, with strongest local contribution during the La Niña phase. This anomaly is coherent with respective anomalies of water vapor (± 0. 5 ppmv) and ozone (± 100 ppbv) derived from CLaMS being in excellent agreement with the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder observations. Thus, during El Niño a more zonally symmetric wave forcing drives a deep branch of the Brewer-Dobson (BD) circulation. During La Niña this forcing increases at lower levels (≈ 390 K) over the tropical Pacific, likely influencing the shallow branch of the BD circulation. In agreement with previous studies, wet (dry) and young (old) tape recorder anomalies propagate upward in the subsequent months following El Niño (La Niña). Using CLaMS, these anomalies are found to be around + 0. 3 (− 0. 2) ppmv and − 4 (+ 4) months for water vapor and AoA, respectively.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate physiological and biochemical responses of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp) to ozone. There were two main factors of the experiment; level of ozone concentration at 40 and 70 ppb and plant ages at 7 and 21 days. Plants were grown in fumigation chambers in which inlet air was filtered by a charcoal filter. Additional ozone was given 8 hours/day for 7 days in ozone fumigating chambers. The ozone concentration in the control chambers was less than 10 ppb. The results showed the biomass of ozone-fumigated plants was significantly lower and leaf injury of ozone fumigated plants was significantly greater compared to the control group. The major visible-injury symptom appeared as chlorosis on the upper surface of the leaves. Antioxidant levels in the charcoal filtered (CF) plants and ozoned plants had significant differences because of their detoxification role in removing ozone and its derivatives. The ozone treatment of 7 -day-old plants showed superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) levels significantly higher than in 21 -day-old plants and total ascorbate concentrations significantly lower than 21 -day-old plants. These results showed that different ozone concentrations exhibit different effects on antioxidant production. Analysis of antioxidants daily for 7 days found that antioxidant levels rapidly changed. Notably, SOD and total ascorbate could be selected as indicators for ozone-effect monitoring in plants. This indicates that cowpea is sensitive to ozone and may be usable as an ozone bioindicator.

40|$|Lu's "cosmic-ray-driven electron-induced {{reaction}} (CRE) theory" {{is based}} on the assumption that the CRE reaction of halogenated molecules (e. g., chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), HCl, ClONO 2) adsorbed or trapped in polar stratospheric clouds in the winter polar stratosphere is the key step in forming photoactive halogen species that are the cause of the springtime ozone hole. This theory has been extended to a warming theory of halogenated molecules for climate change. In this comment, we discuss the chemical and physical foundations of these theories and the conclusions derived from the theories. First, it is unclear whether the loss rates of halogenated molecules induced by dissociative electron attachment (DEA) observed in the laboratory can also be interpreted as atmospheric loss rates, but even if this were the case, the impact of DEA-induced reactions on polar chlorine activation and ozone loss in the stratosphere is limited. Second, we falsify several conclusions that are reported on the basis of the CRE theory: There is no polar ozone loss in darkness, there is no apparent 11 -year periodicity in polar total <b>ozone</b> measurements, the <b>age</b> of air in the polar lower stratosphere is much older than 1 – 2 years, and the reported detection of a pronounced recovery (by about 20 – 25 %) in Antarctic total ozone measurements by the year 2010 is in error. There are also conclusions about the future development of sea ice and global sea level which are fundamentally flawed because Archimedes' principle is neglected. Many elements of the CRE theory are based solely on correlations between certain datasets which are no substitute for providing physical and chemical mechanisms causing a particular behavior noticeable in observations. In summary, the CRE theory cannot be considered as an independent, alternative mechanism for polar stratospheric ozone loss and the conclusions on recent and future surface temperature and global sea level change do not have a physical basis...|$|R

Simulations with the Model for Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers, version 4 (MOZART- 4), a global chemical transport model, have been used to provide a regional context for these observations and assist in their interpretation. These MOZART- 4 simulations reproduce the aircraft observations generally well, but some differences in the modeled volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the observations result from incorrect VOC speciation assumed for the emission inventories. The different types of CO sources represented in the model have been "tagged" to quantify the contributions of regions outside Mexico, as well as the various emissions sectors within Mexico, to the regional air quality of Mexico. This analysis indicates open fires have some, but not a dominant, impact on the atmospheric composition in the region around Mexico City when averaged over the month. However, considerable variation in the fire contribution (2 – 15 % of total CO) is seen during the month. The transport and photochemical aging of Mexico City emissions were studied using tags of CO emissions for each day, showing that typically the air downwind of Mexico City was a combination of many <b>ages.</b> <b>Ozone</b> production in MOZART- 4 is shown to agree well with the net production rates from box model calculations constrained by the MILAGRO aircraft measurements. Ozone production efficiency derived from the ratio of Ox to NOz is higher in MOZART- 4 than in the observations for moderately polluted air. OH reactivity determined from the MOZART- 4 results shows the same increase in relative importance of oxygenated VOCs downwind of Mexico City as the reactivity inferred from the observations.

40|$|Ozone {{pollution}} {{transported to}} the Arctic is a significant concern because of the rapid, enhanced warming in high northern latitudes, which is caused, in part, by short-lived climate forcers, such as ozone. Long-range transport of pollution contributes to background and episodic ozone levels in the Arctic. However, {{the extent to which}} plumes are photochemically active during transport, particularly during the summer, is still uncertain. In this study, regional chemical transport model simulations are used to examine photochemical production of ozone in air masses originating from boreal fire and anthropogenic emissions over North America and during their transport toward the Arctic during early July 2008. Model results are evaluated using POLARCAT aircraft data collected over boreal fire source regions in Canada (ARCTAS-B) and several days downwind over Greenland (POLARCAT-France and POLARCAT-GRACE) during the study period. Model results are generally in good agreement with the observations, except for certain trace gas species over boreal fire regions, in some cases indicating that the fire emissions are too low. Anthropogenic and biomass burning pollution (BB) from North America was rapidly uplifted during transport east and north to Greenland where pollution plumes were observed in the mid- and upper-troposphere during POLARCAT. A model sensitivity study shows that CO levels are in better agreement with POLARCAT measurements (fresh and aged fire plumes) upon doubling CO emissions from fires. Analysis of model results, using &Delta;O 3 /&Delta;CO enhancement ratios, shows that pollution plumes formed ozone during transport towards the Arctic. Fresh anthropogenic plumes have average &Delta;O 3 /&Delta;CO enhancement ratios of 0. 28 increasing to 0. 99 for aged anthropogenic plumes, indicating additional <b>ozone</b> production during <b>aging.</b> Fresh fire plumes are only slightly enhanced in ozone (&Delta;O 3 /&Delta;CO= 0. 11), but form ozone downwind with &Delta;O 3 /&Delta;CO of 0. 50 for aged BB plumes.

In this work, a 29  m 3 smog chamber in the ILMARI facility of the University of Eastern Finland was utilized to investigate the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from a small-scale modern masonry heater commonly used in northern Europe. Emissions were oxidatively aged in the smog chamber {{for a variety of}} dark (i. e., O 3 and NO 3) and UV (i. e., OH) conditions, with OH concentration levels of (0. 5 – 5)  [*]×[*]  10 6  molecules cm − 3, achieving equivalent atmospheric aging of up to 18  h. An aerosol mass spectrometer characterized the direct OA emissions and the SOA formed from the combustion of three wood species (birch, beech and spruce) using two ignition processes (fast ignition with a VOC-to-NO x ratio of 3 and slow ignition with a ratio of 5). Dark and UV aging increased the SOA mass fraction with average SOA productions 2. 0 times the initial OA mass loadings. SOA enhancement was found to be higher for the slow ignition compared with fast ignition conditions. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was used to separate SOA, primary organic aerosol (POA) and their subgroups from the total OA mass spectra. PMF analysis identified two POA and three SOA factors that correlated with the three major oxidizers: ozone, the nitrate radical and the OH radical. Organonitrates (ONs) were observed to be emitted directly from the wood combustion and additionally formed during oxidation via NO 3 radicals (dark aging), suggesting small-scale wood combustion may be a significant ON source. POA was oxidized after the <b>ozone</b> addition, forming <b>aged</b> POA, and after 7  h of aging more than 75  % of the original POA was transformed.

The highest levels for total particle concentration, NO, NO 2, SO 2, benzene, PM 10, PM 2. 5 and chemical elements such as As or Cu were found under flows associated with industrial-urban emissions from the Huelva-Portugal sector which are transported to the site before significant removal by chemical or deposition mechanism can occur. The air masses from the north were affected mainly by crustal elements and biogenic sources, the latter being exemplified by the biogenic species such as isoprene, particularly {{in the first part of}} the campaign. The urban air from the Seville area, before arriving at El Arenosillo traverses the Doñana National Park and therefore, was affected by industrial-urban and biogenic emissions. This air can transport low levels of NO x, total particle concentration and SO 2 with <b>aged</b> <b>ozone</b> and some isoprene. Marine air masses from the Atlantic Ocean influence El Arenosillo frequently. Under these conditions the lowest levels of almost all the species were measured with the exception of ozone levels associated to long-range transport...|$|R
