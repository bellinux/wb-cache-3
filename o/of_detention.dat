5|$|An {{order for}} review <b>of</b> <b>{{detention}}</b> directs someone holding {{a person in}} detention to produce the detainee before the High Court so that {{the legality of the}} detention can be established. The power of the Court to require that this be done is specifically mentioned in Article 9(2) of the Constitution of Singapore. While the other prerogative orders may only be applied for with the court's permission, an order for review <b>of</b> <b>detention</b> may be applied for without prior permission from the court.|$|E
5|$|Since {{an order}} for review <b>of</b> <b>detention</b> is a remedy for {{establishing}} the legality <b>of</b> <b>detention,</b> {{it may not be}} used to challenge the conditions under which a person is held, if the detention itself is lawful. Moreover, an order can only be sought where a person is being physically detained, and not {{if he or she is}} merely under some other form of restriction such as being out on bail.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, while {{a student}} at Bennington College, Dworkin was arrested during an anti-Vietnam War protest at the United States Mission to the United Nations {{and sent to the}} New York Women's House <b>of</b> <b>Detention.</b> Dworkin testified that the doctors in the House <b>of</b> <b>Detention</b> gave her an {{internal}} examination which was so rough that she bled for days afterwards. She spoke in public and testified before a grand jury about her experience, and the media coverage of her testimony made national and international news. The grand jury declined to make an indictment in the case, but Dworkin's testimony contributed to public outrage over the mistreatment of inmates. The prison was closed seven years later.|$|E

5|$|The {{procedure}} for applying for {{an order for}} review <b>of</b> <b>detention</b> differs from that for obtaining a mandatory order, prohibiting order or quashing order because the latter orders are only available by leave of court, whereas an order for review <b>of</b> <b>detention</b> may be applied for without prior permission from the court. The {{procedure for}} doing so is set out in Order 54 of the Rules of Court. An application {{must be made to}} the High Court by way of an ex parte originating summons, supported, if possible, by an affidavit from the person being restrained which shows that the application is being made at his or her instance and explaining the nature of the restraint. If the person under restraint is unable to personally make an affidavit, someone may do so on his or her behalf, explaining the reason for the inability.|$|E
5|$|The {{test for}} {{judicial}} review on matters not {{relating to the}} ISA remains the objective test. In Kamal Jit Singh v. Minister for Home Affairs (1992), the High Court held that validity <b>of</b> <b>detention</b> under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act is not dependent on the Minister's subjective satisfaction. Rather, the Minister must be objectively satisfied that the person was associated with criminal activities.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the filing}} of the application, the Court may either make an order immediately, or direct that a summons for the order for review <b>of</b> <b>detention</b> be issued to enable all the parties {{involved}} to present arguments to the Court. If the latter course is taken, the ex parte originating summons, supporting affidavit, order of court and summons must be served on the person against whom the order is sought. Unless the Court directs otherwise, {{it is not necessary}} for the person under restraint to be brought before the Court for the hearing of the application. In addition, the Court may order that the person be released while the application is being heard. Once the Court decides to make an order for review <b>of</b> <b>detention,</b> it will direct when the person under restraint is to be brought before the court.|$|E

5|$|After {{questioning}} during 96 hours <b>of</b> <b>detention,</b> Tabak {{was charged}} on 22 January 2011 {{with the murder}} of Joanna Yeates. He made a brief appearance at Bristol's Magistrates' Court on 24 January and was remanded in custody. Tabak, legally represented by Paul Cook, declined to request bail during a hearing the following day. Tabak was moved from Bristol Prison because of fears for his safety, and was placed under suicide watch at Long Lartin Prison near Evesham. Tabak's family and friends in the Netherlands started to raise funds for his court defence.|$|E
5|$|Article 9(2) of the Constitution enshrines {{the right}} of persons who have been {{detained}} {{to apply to the}} High Court challenging the legality of their detention. The application is for an order for review <b>of</b> <b>detention,</b> which was formerly called a writ of habeas corpus. The Court is required to inquire into the complaint, and order the detainee to be produced before the Court and released unless it is satisfied that the detention is lawful.|$|E
5|$|Once an {{individual}} has been detained, there are administrative processes which the executive is required to follow under sections 9, 11 and 12 of the Act. The detainee is to be informed of the grounds <b>of</b> <b>detention</b> as soon as possible, unless their disclosure is against the national interest. He or she is to be served {{with a copy of}} the detention order as well as the grounds and allegations of fact on which the detention order was made.|$|E

In general, where {{the manner in which}} the detention is conducted is alleged to be unlawful, the detainee's remedy is to challenge the validity of the conditions <b>of</b> the <b>detention,</b> not the lawfulness <b>of</b> the <b>detention</b> itself.|$|R

5|$|The {{subjective}} test was rejected {{for several reasons}} by the Court of Appeal. It held that applying the {{subjective test}} to sections 8 and 10 of the ISA would render the provisions unconstitutional. The word law in Article 12(1) of the Constitution was held in Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor (1980) to encompass fundamental rules of natural justice. Hence, Parliament cannot pass legislation which authorizes the executive to exercise power in breach of these fundamental rules or to exercise power in an arbitrary manner. If the subjective test were to be adopted, it would in effect allow the executive to exercise arbitrary powers <b>of</b> <b>detention,</b> therefore rendering sections8 and 10 of the ISA inconsistent with Article12(1). When the case was decided, Article149(1) of the Constitution, which protects the validity of anti-subversion laws notwithstanding inconsistencies with specified fundamental liberties, did not cover inconsistencies with Article12. Also, the Court noted that adopting the objective test {{would be consistent with}} Article93 of the Constitution, which vests judicial power in the courts. It did not, however, directly address the argument by counsel that the subjective test, in conferring arbitrary powers <b>of</b> <b>detention,</b> would be inconsistent with Article93.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the exact}} number of French prisoners who escaped from captivity in Germany is unknown, it has been {{estimated}} at around 70,000, representing approximately five per cent of all French prisoners. The Vichy government did not encourage prisoners to escape, but many of its officials were sympathetic to escapees who reached French territory. Some prisoners, particularly those working in agriculture, spent substantial amounts of time without guards, and prisoners caught by the Germans trying to escape were rarely severely punished. During the period <b>of</b> <b>detention</b> in France, fines were sometimes imposed on locals for mass escapes of prisoners in the region. It was partially to prevent escapes that led to the German decision to deport prisoners to the Reich.|$|E

He {{was described by}} the media as self-radicalized, having been deeply influenced by the lectures of Feiz Mohammad and Anwar al-Aulaqi which he had accessed online. Around this time, two other people influenced by al-Aulaqi were placed under restriction orders. Between January and July 2011, three Muslim radicals were deported to Singapore from other countries and detained. JI members Jumari bin Kamdi and Samad bin Subari were arrested in Malaysia and Indonesia respectively; while Abdul Majid s/o Kunji Mohammad, {{a member of the}} Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), was arrested in Malaysia. As of 13 September 2011, there were 17 people on orders <b>of</b> <b>detention,</b> one whose detention had been suspended, and 49 people on restriction orders. On 7 March 2013, it was mentioned in Parliament that 64 people had been detained under the ISA for activities related to terrorism since 2002.|$|E

The Franks, van Pelses, and Pfeffer were taken to RSHA headquarters, where they were interrogated and held overnight. On 5 August they were {{transferred}} to the Huis van Bewaring (House <b>of</b> <b>Detention),</b> an overcrowded prison on the Weteringschans. Two days later they were transported to the Westerbork transit camp, through which by that time more than 100,000 Jews, mostly Dutch and German, had passed. Having been arrested in hiding, they were considered criminals and sent to the Punishment Barracks for hard labour.|$|E

While snooping in her desk to take back his yo-yo, he discovers her personal ad, and decides to get revenge on her pulling a prank and responding by mail. He creates a new adult male alter ego named Woodrow, after former President Woodrow Wilson. Edna responds by sending a suggestive photograph. Bart writes a response to Edna, using lines from a old love letter Homer had sent Marge.|$|E
5|$|The detainee {{is also to}} be {{informed}} within 14 days {{of his or her}} right to make representations against the order to an advisory board, which is required to hear and consider the detainee's representations. Each advisory board is chaired by a Supreme Court judge appointed by the President, and has two other members appointed by the President in consultation with the Chief Justice. The board has the powers of a court to summon and examine witnesses, and to order that documents be produced. It evaluates the evidence and must make recommendations to the President concerning the matter within three months of the date <b>of</b> <b>detention.</b> When the advisory board recommends the release of the detainee against the Minister's decision, the President exercises personal discretion whether the detainee should be released. Before exercising his discretion, the President is required to consult the Council of Presidential Advisers.|$|E

50|$|The use of Guantánamo Bay as a {{military}} prison has drawn criticism from human rights organizations and others, who cite reports that detainees have been tortured or otherwise poorly treated.

50|$|At that time, the {{government}} announced that it suspected 10 to 15 of the detainees as being al Qaeda sympathizers, but said that no evidence links them directly to the attacks.

5|$|The {{length of}} time that a typical {{prisoner}} was kept at the Bastille continued to decline, and by Louis XVI's reign the average length <b>of</b> <b>detention</b> was only two months. Prisoners would still be expected to sign a document on their release, promising {{not to talk about}} the Bastille or their time within it, but by the 1780s this agreement was frequently broken. Prisoners leaving the Bastille could be granted pensions on their release by the Crown, either as a form of compensation or as a way of ensuring future good behaviour – Voltaire was granted 1,200 livres a year, for example, while Latude received an annual pension of 400 livres.|$|E
5|$|The {{remedies}} {{available in}} Singapore administrative law are the prerogative orders – the mandatory order (formerly known as mandamus), prohibiting order (prohibition), quashing order (certiorari), and order for review <b>of</b> <b>detention</b> (habeas corpus) – and the declaration, {{a form of}} equitable remedy. In Singapore, administrative law is the branch of law that enables a person to challenge an exercise of power by {{the executive branch of}} the Government. The challenge is carried out by applying to the High Court for judicial review. The Court's power to review a law or an official act of a government official is part of its supervisory jurisdiction, and at its fullest may involve quashing an action or decision and ordering that it be redone or remade.|$|E
5|$|Article 20 {{provides}} {{protection from}} conviction for offences in certain respects, including the rights against {{ex post facto}} laws, double jeopardy and freedom from self-incrimination. Article 22 provides specific rights to arrested and detained persons, in particular the rights to be informed of the grounds of arrest, consult a lawyer of one's own choice, be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest, and the freedom not to be detained beyond that period without an order of the magistrate. The Constitution also authorizes the State to make laws providing for preventive detention, subject to certain other safeguards present in Article 22. The provisions pertaining to preventive detention were discussed with skepticism and misgivings by the Constituent Assembly, and were reluctantly approved after a few amendments in 1949. Article 22 provides that {{when a person is}} detained under any law of preventive detention, the State can detain such person without trial for only three months, and any detention for a longer period must be authorised by an Advisory Board. The person being detained also has the right to be informed about the grounds <b>of</b> <b>detention,</b> and be permitted to make a representation against it, at the earliest opportunity.|$|E
