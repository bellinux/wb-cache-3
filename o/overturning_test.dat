40|$|During {{the last}} years the {{increasing}} number of fatal coach accidents with tragic consequences for passengers showed the importance of passive safety in addition to the driver’s competence and active safety. In the European countries the certification of sufficient deformation strength when overturning is compulsory for the approval of a coach according to the ECE R 66 regulation. The certification is granted after positive results from crash tests or computer simulations with partial or full bus structure. The ECE R 66 regulation defines a survival space for the passengers which must remain intact after the accident. The tests specify either the overturning of the vehicle structure from a tilting platform or the impact of a plate on the coach structure as it would correspond to the crash of the structure when falling onto the ground. Since such tests with real vehicle structures are costly and computer efficiency, on the other hand, is becoming increasingly better and cheaper, crash simulations will play a more important role for the approval in the future. This paper will present different LS-DYNA – time simulations of the <b>overturning</b> <b>test</b> with a segment of a bus structure according to ECE R 66 and time simulations with a pivoted plate hitting with the same kinetic energy against the structure as the model falling from the tilting platform and crashing onto the floor. Several modelling configurations with deformable and rigid undercarriage, with different friction coefficients of the contact ground-structure, are simulated. These calculations shall serve as a preparation for future calculations to obtain the necessary certification. Unfortunately no experimental results are available at present to enable the comparison between hardware test and computer simulation. However, the experience gained with tilting tests of similar coach structures in the past indicates the trustworthiness of the calculations. As these experiences are published on the panel of a users’ meeting, this paper goes more then usual into detail regarding the modelling and the difficulties in simulations which the authors, until that time unfamiliar with LS-DYNA, has to overcome. A short introduction to the variable test possibilities explained in regulation ECE R 66 is given...|$|E

40|$|Robust {{analytical}} models {{accounting for}} the dynamic behavior of historic masonry buildings have to date received limited attention. Dynamic testing using shaking table are constrained by cost and results depend highly on the specific characteristic of the masonry. Based on results by several authors obtained both experimentally by static <b>overturning</b> <b>tests</b> and analytically by use of the discrete element approach, {{the aim of the}} work presented is to gain better insight into the behavior of masonry historic structures subjected to seismic action by using multi rigid body dynamics. A large number of tests were conducted on a shaking-table on 1 / 10 -scale 3 dimensional dry masonry specimens. Prototypes of same plan area and different height and mass were considered. Sinusoidal waves varying in frequencies based on both constant amplitudes and constant accelerations were used as input. The models are relatively simple, made of a number of blocks sufficient to ensure that the fundamental interaction among parts of masonry walls connected in three dimensions to form buildings is accurately replicated. Results are presented in terms of relative displacement, frequency and energy content of the motion. Global results in terms of deformed shape and crack pattern of the walls are also discussed. An analytical approach to represent the various phenomena observed is proposed...|$|R

40|$|Analyses of {{accident}} statistics {{have revealed that}} in Germany about 1000 accidents happen every year in which tank trucks transporting hazardous materials are involved. In about 60 of these cases leakage of hazardous materials is likely, thus adding {{to the risk of}} injuries to persons, large damage to property and the environment. The idea of the THESEUS project was to lessen this risk. Systematic and reproducible experiments were conducted on single components, tank trucks in their entirety and safety devices to look into driving stability, overturning and crash performance. By this approach the safety level under accident-induced loads was to be analysed and to made assessable. Accident data were collected and analysed with a view to defining realistic test parameters. The most frequent types {{of accident}}s turned out to be those caused solely by the driver's negligence (i. e. not involving other vehicles) accounting for 70 % of the total hazardous materials spills, the rear-end collision and the side collision of a commercial vehicle with a tank truck. To help avoid accidents involving overturning caused solely by the driver's negligence, a limit value of 25 degrees should become mandatory for the dumper-body angle. Liquids in motion do not {{have an effect on the}} overturning limit in non-stationary driving manoeuvres. In crash and <b>overturning</b> <b>tests</b> durations of impact of up to 420 ms, mean forces of impact of up to 600 kN, deformation work of up to 780 kJ and pressures of up to 5 bar were recorded which can be referred to as design loads. Improved impact protection devices were found to prevent tank failures in rear-end collisions up to 60 km/h, in side impacts up to 50 km/h. To design the tank to withstand local load applications a new wall thickness formula was proposed taking acoount of the tensile strength of the tank material and the entire mass of the tank truck. To test the global load application a representative section of the tank was subjected to a drop test. The combination of a lowered centre of gravity, overturning hazard warning devices, optimized dome covers, pipes as well as valves and fittings and ranging systems led to the highest cost-benefit ratios.

40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{a contribution to}} the study of seismic behaviour of unreinforced masonry structures by means of both experimental and modelling approaches. To this purpose, a shake-table laboratory campaign on a tuff masonry U-shaped assemblage is presented. The specimen is made of a facade wall, which is adjacent but not interlocked with two transverse walls; such condition is common in actual historical buildings due non-synchronic construction and/or later addition. Scaled natural accelerograms are adopted, which induce on the facade an out-of-plane motion of increasing intensity, from the starting of rocking up to <b>overturning.</b> The <b>tests</b> confirm the existence of a significant dynamic reserve of stability, which allows the facade to be set into motion without necessarily collapsing. Furthermore, the main factors affecting the dynamic behaviour of the wall are highlighted, such as the presence of imperfections and tilted foundation, the dependency on the input and on the energy dissipations. Two modelling approaches are presented, based on the Discrete Element Method and on a Single-Degree-of-Freedom analytic model, respectively. The two approaches prove capable of reproducing the tests, in terms of both entire time history and maximum rotation, even if model parameters are roughly assumed. Eventually, experimental and numerical data, generated through the established models, are used to check force and displacement-based seismic code assessment procedures...|$|R

40|$|Modeling studies {{predict that}} changes in {{radiocarbon}} (14 C) reservoir ages of surface waters during the last deglacial episode will reflect changes in both atmospheric 14 C concentration and ocean circulation including the Atlantic Meridional <b>Overturning</b> Circulation. <b>Tests</b> of these models require the availability of accurate 14 C reservoir ages in well-dated late Quaternary time series. We here test two models using plateau-tuned 14 C time series in multiple well-placed sediment core age-depth sequences throughout the lower latitudes of the Atlantic Ocean. 14 C age plateau tuning in glacial and deglacial sequences provides accurate calendar year ages that differ {{by as much as}} 500 - 2500 years from those based on assumed global reservoir ages around 400 years. This study demonstrates increases in local Atlantic surface reservoir ages of up to 1000 years during the Last Glacial Maximum, ages that reflect stronger trades off Benguela and summer winds off southern Brazil. By contrast, surface water reservoir ages remained close to zero in the Cariaco Basin in the southern Caribbean due to lagoon-style isolation and persistently strong atmospheric CO 2 exchange. Later, during the early deglacial (16 ka) reservoir ages decreased to a minimum of 170 - 420 14 C years throughout the South Atlantic, likely in response to the rapid rise in atmospheric pCO 2 and Antarctic temperatures occurring then. Changes in magnitude and geographic distribution of 14 C reservoir ages of peak glacial and deglacial surface waters deviate from the results of Franke et al.

40|$|This chapter {{describes}} the idea beyond Noar, a persuasive urban game designed to enquire if and how players can get {{affected by a}} game experience aimed at subverting common patterns of interaction, triggering reflections about usual or unusual social interactions.

Can we push social interactions via in-game mechanics for impacting on players, creating or increasing understanding? The game aims at involving players into a story of transformation, where they are not spectators who watch and empathise with the characters portrayed. They become actors in the story who can directly put themselves to the <b>test,</b> <b>overturning</b> their way of experiencing interactions. Tackling the fundamental issue of how individuals relate to their surroundings and to others, Noar intends to start a game-based process of change, which fundamentals are rooted in situated transformational learning theory (Mezirow, 1996). This game is indeed designed to challenge our ordinary way of perceiving and experiencing social interactions, and suggests consequential meaning making...|$|R

Additionally, reactiontimes in tortoises placed in a normal or overturned positionwere measured as a proxy of antipredator response. More than 400 adult Hermann’s tortoises from six populations were testedin the field during two seasons. Measures of travellingability and antipredator response varied markedly among populations,and thus with environmental characteristics such as habitat type, terrain ruggedness and presence of predators. Tortoises from rugged and hot habitats (e. g.
