5|$|Harding {{retired in}} 1859 and was succeeded {{by his son}} William White Harding, who had become a partner three years earlier. William Harding changed {{the name of the}} {{newspaper}} to its current name, The Philadelphia Inquirer. Harding, in an attempt to increase circulation, cut the price <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper,</b> began delivery routes and had newsboys sell papers on the street. In 1859, circulation had been around 7,000; by 1863 it had increased to 70,000. Part of the increase was due to the interest in news during the American Civil War. Twenty-five to thirty thousand copies of The Inquirer were often distributed to Union soldiers during the war and several times the U.S. government asked The Philadelphia Inquirer to issue a special edition specifically for soldiers. The Philadelphia Inquirer supported the Union, but Harding wanted their coverage to remain neutral. Confederate generals often sought copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper,</b> believing that the newspaper's war coverage was accurate.|$|E

40|$|Context: <b>The</b> quality <b>of</b> an Systematic Literature Review (SLR) {{is as good}} as <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{reviewed}} <b>papers.</b> Hence, it {{is vital}} to rigorously assess <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> included in an SLR. There has been no tertiary study aimed at re- porting <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> practice <b>of</b> quality assessment used in SLRs in Software Engineering (SE). Objective: We aimed to study <b>the</b> practices <b>of</b> quality as- sessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> included in SLRs in SE. Method: We conducted a tertiary study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SLRs that have performed quality assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reviewed <b>papers.</b> Results: We identified and analyzed different aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quality assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> included in 127 SLRs. Conclusion: Researchers use a variety of strategies for quality assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> reviewed, but report lit- tle about the justification for the used criteria. The focus is creditability but not relevance aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>papers.</b> Appro- priate guidelines are required for devising quality assessment strategies.

30|$|Effects of pH, sizing agent, and starch on <b>the</b> natural {{deterioration}} <b>of</b> 45 printed wood-free papers stored 1 â€“ 32 {{years was}} investigated in terms of MIT folding endurance, brightness, and L*a*b* values. The neutral and alkaline papers retained their folding endurances well and significantly lost their yellow color (b*) during storage. <b>The</b> folding endurance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acidic <b>papers</b> stored more than 15 years showed a declining trend with increased storage time. The sizing agent content in <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> stored more than 10 years increased and <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> starch decreased with increasing storage years. A larger amount <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sizing agents correlated with less folding endurance and more yellow color <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>papers.</b> <b>The</b> relation between the starch content and <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> yellow color <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> was unclear, and <b>the</b> endurance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> increased with <b>the</b> increase in starch content.|$|R

25|$|Contrary to Gutenberg {{printing}}, {{which allowed}} printing {{on both sides}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> from its very beginnings (although not simultaneously until very recent times), East Asian printing was done only on one side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper,</b> because the need to rub the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> when printing would have spoilt the first side when the second side was printed. Another reason was that, unlike in Europe where Gutenberg introduced more suitable oil-based ink, Asian printing remained confined to water-based inks which tended to soak through the paper.|$|E
