40|$|In 2008, {{various aspects}} of the tree stem profile were {{measured}} and 200 bark samples removed from 55 individual stems of beech species at Tosakoti sites in Mazandaran provinces in the north of Iran in the Hyrcanian forest. Hyrcanian forests are located at green strip extending over the northern slopes of Alborz range of mountains and the southern coasts of the Caspian Sea. Bark thickness was measured from each stem with bark gauges at 6 different relative heights. The measured stem variables used in this study are diameter <b>over</b> <b>bark</b> at relative heights 1, 10, 30, 50, 70 and 90 %; bark thickness at the same relative heights; diameter <b>over</b> <b>bark</b> at breast height; bark thickness at breast height; tree height; tree age. In this study, bark amount is expressed either as double bark thickness or as the proportion of <b>over</b> <b>bark</b> diameter or volume. Percent of bark volume of beech trees is about 6. 04 % of tree volume. Average double bark thickness was greatest at the base (1 % relative height) 18 mm and decreased uniformly towards the top (90 % relative height) 8 mm. Bark proportion (from the diameter) decreased from the base to the 20 % relative height being 4 % at its minimum. After that the bark proportion increased first slowly then rapidly being finally 10 % at a relative height of 90 %. The general form of bark curves at different breast height diameter classes is highly similar and therefore we can assume that the general form of a bark curve does not depend on tree size.

In the beginning the plan was to study and measure 20 sites before and after harvest. Due to storms during the summer of 2010, complete data could only be obtained from 8 of these 20 sites. Seven of these sites were privately owned and one was owned by UPM, all of the sites had been pre-commercially thinned. The mean stem density before harvest was 2578 stems per ha and the mean stem volume was 0. 074 m 3 solid <b>over</b> <b>bark.</b> On average 1518 stems/ha was harvested. The mean tree size was 0. 077 m 3 s of harvested stems, which corresponds to a basal area removal of 11 m 2 /ha or biomass removal of 59 raw tonnes /ha of which 41. 2 raw tonnes (raw density) was pulpwood and 17. 9 raw tonnes were energy wood.

Mean root depth and spread of the lateral roots, hereafter referred to as root depth and root spread, were measured in situ (Table  1).
