5|$|At the beginning, {{jumping on}} every cube once {{is enough to}} advance. In later stages, each cube must be hit twice to reach the target color. Other times, cubes change color every time Q*bert lands on them, instead of {{remaining}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> color once they reach it. Both elements are then combined in subsequent stages. Jumping off the pyramid results in the character's death.|$|E

5|$|After launch, {{the missile}} was guided towards the target {{location}} {{as determined by}} the ship using a three-axis Attitude Reference Assembly (ATA) in an AN/DSQ-44 guidance section. The ATA was less accurate than a full-fledged inertial system, but good enough for Harpoon's range. For stabilization and control, the AGM-84A had four fixed cruciform wings (3x BSU-42/B, 1x BSU-43/B) and four movable BSU-44/B tail fins. The missile flew at a low cruise altitude and at a predetermined distance from the expected target position, its AN/DSQ-28 J-band active radar seeker in the nose was activated to acquire and lock <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>target.</b> The radar switch-on distance could be set to lower or higher values, the former requiring a more precisely-known target location but reducing the risk to be defeated by enemy Electronic Counter Measures (ECM).|$|E

5|$|Australia {{received}} a fire-control director sometime between mid-1915 and May 1916; this centralised fire control under the director officer, who now fired the guns.

Australia was also fitted with an additional inch of armour around the midships turrets following the Battle of Jutland.|$|E
5|$|Broke drilled {{his crew}} to an {{extremely}} {{high standard of}} naval gunnery; he regularly had them fire at targets, such as floating barrels. Often these drills would be made into competitions to see which gun crew could hit the target and how fast they could do so. He even had his gun crews fire at targets 'blindfold' to good effect; they were only given the bearing to lay their gun on without being allowed to sight the gun <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> themselves. This constituted a very early example of 'director firing'.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{several groups}} were {{involved}} {{in an attempt to}} relocate the Minnesota Timberwolves of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from Minneapolis, Minnesota to New Orleans, Louisiana. The proposed relocation would have been the second involving a Minneapolis-based franchise in the span of two years, as Minneapolis had lost its National Hockey League (NHL) franchise to Dallas in 1993. Timberwolves owners Marv Wolfenson and Harvey Ratner were considering selling the team due to problems with the mortgage <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Target</b> Center, the team's arena that had been built only four years earlier as part of Minneapolis' 1989 entry into the NBA. The events of the attempted relocation resulted in Glen Taylor, businessman and former Minnesota State Senator, purchasing the team and keeping it in Minneapolis.|$|E

5|$|Princess Royal {{received}} a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised fire-control under the gunnery officer who now fired the guns.

5|$|Several {{designs for}} the exact method of {{destroying}} the target were suggested. One of these {{was to have the}} satellite carry out a kamikaze attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> while another was to coat it with black paint, blocking its ability to see or transmit, rendering it inoperable. Yet another was for it to use a laser to disable reconnaissance or optical sensors of the target. Another suggestion was for the satellite to carry a nuclear missile, of up to one megaton yield, and launch it at the satellite. However, in July 1959, Joseph V. Charyk directed that all technical efforts were to be focused on developing the inspection function, rather than the kill function, effectively ending its role as a satellite interceptor, and shifting the project {{to the development of a}} satellite inspector.|$|E
5|$|She {{received}} a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised fire control under the director officer who now fired the guns. The turret crewmen merely {{had to follow}} pointers transmitted from the director to align their guns <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>target.</b> This greatly increased accuracy since the ship's roll no longer dispersed the shells as each turret fired on its own; also, the fire-control director could more easily spot {{the fall of the}} shells.|$|E

5|$|Testing of the Disney bombs {{began in}} early 1945. Bombs were {{initially}} dropped on a bombing range near Southampton to photographically record their trajectory and calibrate bombsights. This was necessary as the flight-path of a rocket-accelerated bomb differed considerably {{from that of}} a free–falling bomb. Test drops were then conducted on the Watten bunker, German codename Kraftwerk Nord West (now known as the Blockhaus d'Éperlecques), a large German concrete bunker near Watten in northern France. This was ideal for the purpose as the area had been captured by Allied forces in September 1944, so damage to the structure could be inspected after bomb tests. Four bombs, carried by two B-17s, were used and two hits scored <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>target.</b> The resultant damage was considered satisfactory by Royal Navy observers on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The main {{design feature}} of the Mk. XIV was that it gave the bomb aimer more {{time to work on}} the problem of {{bringing}} the aircraft to the proper location to drop the bombs. As the calculations of this location were being carried out automatically, he could concentrate solely on the sight throughout the bomb run. The sight projected crosshairs into space so they were in focused at infinity, allowing the user to focus their eyes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> and not have to change focus to see the line.|$|E
5|$|Brain {{activity}} {{is made possible}} by the interconnections of neurons that are linked together to reach their targets. A neuron consists of a cell body, axon, and dendrites. Dendrites are often extensive branches that receive information in the form of signals from the axon terminals of other neurons. The signals received may cause the neuron to initiate an action potential (an electrochemical signal or nerve impulse) which is sent along its axon to the axon terminal, to connect with the dendrites or with the cell body of another neuron. An action potential is initiated at the initial segment of an axon, which contains a complex of proteins. When an action potential, reaches the axon terminal it triggers the release of a neurotransmitter at a synapse that propagates a signal that acts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> cell. These chemical neurotransmitters include dopamine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter. Neurons link at synapses to form pathways and elaborate neural networks, and the activity between them is driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{evaluate}} inflation targeting for ten countries.

Testing this hypothesis I find that the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and Korea have focused strongly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inflation <b>target.</b> <b>The</b> United Kingdom has had <b>the</b> strongest focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inflation <b>target</b> and Poland <b>the</b> least. In an extended approach I add lagged output gap as an information variable for countries where data was available. I then get the result that the null hypothesis of central banks focusing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inflation <b>target</b> can be rejected for six countries. ...|$|R
