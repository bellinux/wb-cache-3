5|$|It {{is often}} {{held that the}} Renown and Courageous classes were {{designed}} for Fisher's plan to land troops (possibly Russian) on the German Baltic coast. Specifically, they were designed with a reduced draught, which might be important in the shallow Baltic. This is not clear-cut evidence that the ships were designed for the Baltic: it was considered that earlier ships had too much draught and not enough freeboard under <b>operational</b> <b>conditions.</b> Roberts argues that {{the focus on the}} Baltic was probably unimportant at the time the ships were designed, but was inflated later, after the disastrous Dardanelles Campaign.|$|E
5|$|However it was {{considered}} the low-level sight's chief advantages would be demonstrated under <b>operational</b> <b>conditions.</b> The sight {{was considered}} a great advancement on any previous method of low-level bombing, either by eye or with a bombsight. The best figures from No. 59 Squadron's trials were 6yd range error with release from 800ft, and 5yd error when approaching at 100ft, but releasing from 400ft with the aircraft's nose slightly up. Some academics in the ORS stated a 20yd error range existed but maintained the Mark III was promising. Some crews did not trust the device, which was the case when asked to use equipment of which they had little experience. Instead, many continued relying on their own trusted eyesight. A continued lack of resources meant there was no widespread use of the sights. In later months, the aircrew changed tactics and with new weapons, they decided {{that it would take}} too long to zero-in on a target using the device. Pilots and crew often opted to use their own judgement by direct sighting with considerable success.|$|E
25|$|A capacitor's {{lifetime}} {{for different}} <b>operational</b> <b>conditions</b> {{can be estimated}} using special formulas or graphs specified in the data sheets of serious manufacturers. They use different ways achieve the specification; some provide special formulas, others specify their capacitor lifetime calculation with graphs that {{take into account the}} influence of applied voltage. The basic principle for calculating the time under <b>operational</b> <b>conditions</b> is the so-called “10-degree-rule”.|$|E

25|$|The {{lifetime}} of electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolytes {{depends on the}} evaporations rate and therefore on the core temperature of the capacitor. This core temperature {{on the other hand}} depends on the ripple current load. Using the 10-degree-rule with the capacitor case temperature gives a good approach to <b>operational</b> <b>conditions.</b> In case of higher ripple currents the lifetime could be influenced positively with force cooling.|$|E
25|$|In November 1936, Richthofen {{left the}} Technical Service staff {{to take a}} field command in the Condor Legion, a Luftwaffe {{contingent}} sent to support General Francisco Franco's Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War. Udet continued with the dive bomber concept and the Ju 87 first saw action under Richthofen's command in Spain. Wolfram retained his position as Head of Development, but he was now tasked with the evaluation of aircraft under <b>operational</b> <b>conditions.</b> His role expanded in January 1937, and he became Chief of Staff to Hugo Sperrle, who was to command the Legion.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{advantages}} of the plug-in hybrid design is that the generator can be completely decoupled from the traction. Unlike a conventional engine, which operates over a wide variety of power settings and <b>operational</b> <b>conditions,</b> the range extender can be operated under optimum conditions at all times. High-efficiency power sources that are not suitable for normal automotive use may be perfectly suitable for PEV use. These include advanced close-cycle steam engines, stirling engines, Wankel engines, and microturbines due primarily to their light weight and small size.|$|E

25|$|Unable {{to obtain}} the Norden, the RAF {{continued}} development of their own designs. Having moved to night bombing, where visual accuracy was difficult under even the best conditions, they introduced the much simpler Mark XIV bomb sight. This was designed not for accuracy above all, but ease of use in <b>operational</b> <b>conditions.</b> In testing in 1944, it was found to offer a CEP of , about what the Norden was offering at that time. This led to a debate within the RAF whether {{to use their own}} tachometric design, the Stabilized Automatic Bomb Sight, or use the Mk. XIV on future bombers. The Mk. XIV ultimately served into the 1960s while the SABS was removed from service almost immediately after the war.|$|E
25|$|The Special Casualty Access Team (SCAT) {{was first}} formed in 1986, {{from the need}} for {{paramedic}} ambulance officers {{to be able to}} provide high quality pre-hospital care to patients wherever they are. The Service currently has sixty SCAT officers throughout NSW. The roles of SCAT are many and varied including: medical support to the various rescue agencies, specialist police units (such as the State Protection Group) and fire brigades in Urban Search and Rescue / Hazmat; bushfires and urban search and rescue; working on Rescue and medical retrieval helicopters; and accessing and treating patients in caves, canyons, mines, and on cliff ledges. SCAT officers are self-sufficient and often ‘camp out’ with their patients when weather or <b>operational</b> <b>conditions</b> dictate a need to ‘stay put’ for a period (at times up to 24 hours without support). 'Core' SCAT skills focuses on safety and personal attributes (resilience, adaptability, teamwork & leadership) which is assessed under a range of testing conditions during an eight-week course.|$|E
25|$|The 6C 2500 Coloniale was a staff car {{version of}} the third series 6c 2500. It had been {{commissioned}} in 1938 by the Italian Ministry of Defense, for military use in the Italian colonies. Two prototypes 6C 2500 Coloniale were manufactured in 1939. One of them was shipped to Italian East Africa, where Giambattista Guidotti had been instructed to conduct testing in the harsh <b>operational</b> <b>conditions.</b> The car {{was the first to}} be manufactured using technology developed by the renowned Carrozzeria Touring, the Superleggera. The car had two spare wheels, a fuel tank of 120 litres and four additional reserves with a capacity of 70 litres of gasoline. In addition there was a locking differential, engaged from the dashboard by the driver. Regular production started in 1941, and the first batch of 150 vehicles was delivered between 1941 and 1942; afterwards production stopped due to the war events Total production amounted to 150 series cars plus two prototypes.|$|E

25|$|After Germany {{attacked}} the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, the British government allied {{itself with the}} Soviet Union on 12 July and Churchill pressed Sikorski to also reach {{an agreement with the}} Soviets. The Sikorski–Mayski treaty was signed on 30 July despite strong resistance from Sikorski's opponents in the exile government (three cabinet ministers resigned, including Foreign Minister August Zaleski and General Sosnkowski) and Polish-Soviet diplomatic relations were restored. The territorial aspects of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact had been invalidated. Polish soldiers and others imprisoned in the Soviet Union since 1939 were released and the formation of a Polish army there was agreed, intended to fight on the Eastern Front, help the Red Army to liberate Poland and establish a sovereign Polish state. Other issues, including Poland's borders, were left to be determined in the future. A Polish-Soviet military agreement was signed on 14 August; it attempted to specify the political and <b>operational</b> <b>conditions</b> for the functioning of the Polish army. Sikorski's preference, stated around 1 September, was for the Polish army to be deployed in defense of the Caucasus oil fields, which would allow it to maintain close contacts with the British forces.|$|E
25|$|Another {{tactical}} consideration led to operational innovation. Richthofen {{adopted the}} shuttle air tactic. In order to maximise support over the frontline, aircraft operated from bases {{near the front}} to keep and gain an advantage. It was very successful in the 1937 battles. Aircraft were sent in small formations to bomb frontline positions, while other groups of ground attack aircraft were en route and refuelling. This way a constant air presence was maintained over the battlefield which eroded the effectiveness and morale of the enemy. In order {{for this to be}} able to work effectively, three or more sorties needed to be flown per day. This required a large number of personnel to set up and man forward airfields. At the operational level, the Luftwaffes logistics units had to be completely motorised to bring in fuel, ammunition and spare parts. These units had the opportunity to be tested under tough <b>operational</b> <b>conditions.</b> The experience in Spain had shown air transport units were invaluable to logistics, and with Richthofen's input, were expanded accordingly. By 1939, the Luftwaffe would have the largest, and most capable transport service in the World.|$|E
25|$|The Terrex AV81 is an {{armoured}} fighting vehicle weighing between 25 and 30 tons an 8×8 {{wheeled chassis}} and modern armour. Multiple weapon platforms are supported, including both the remote and overhead weapons stations. The Terrex's modular design allows for different level of armour protection and weapon systems. It {{is designed to}} be air-portable by C-130s or equivalent cargo aircraft. The Terrex uses a patented independent double wishbone suspension, which greatly improves ground mobility and comfort during rides over rough terrains. The use of automatic traction control and the capacity for large footprint off-road tyres enables the Terrex to reach high speed on soft ground. The vehicle has a double hull with an external V-hull that improves mine blast survivability. Add-on armour provides further protection for troops. It is also capable of providing full chemical, biological and nuclear protection in extreme <b>operational</b> <b>conditions.</b> The baseline configuration is fully amphibious. Two water jets mounted on either side {{at the back of the}} hull propel the vehicle through water at 10km/h. Initially developed for export sales from the number of emerging wheeled armoured vehicle requirements including U.S. Interim Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) concept, which calls for the need of wheeled armoured fighting vehicles (AFV) as opposed to tracked AFVs. In 2006, the SAF decided to purchase 135 units to replace their aging V-200 armoured vehicles. The Indonesian Army also indicated plans to purchase 420 units and to produce the Terrex under license locally.|$|E

500|$|The {{difference}} between bombing {{results on the}} test range and in <b>operational</b> <b>conditions</b> {{was by no means}} unique to the Mk. XIV.
