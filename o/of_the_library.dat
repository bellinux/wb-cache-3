5|$|Rodney K. Waldron {{served as}} the head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>library</b> from 1954 until 1984. In {{the same year as}} Waldron's departure, Melvin R.

In 1986, a room was added to the library to accommodate a donation from alumnus Linus Pauling, which consisted of his papers and two Nobel Prizes.|$|E

5|$|A {{library was}} {{operating}} from the wooden church building by 1860. Patronage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>library</b> had declined markedly by the 20th century {{and by the}} 1930s it was virtually unused. A mobile library began calling in the 1960s {{and for a time}} called once per month. The bookmobile service was finally ended, for all places not only Whitemore, in 1998.|$|E

25|$|Suppose {{that every}} public library has {{to compile a}} {{catalogue}} of all its books. Since the catalogue is itself one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>library's</b> books, some librarians include it in the catalogue for completeness; while others leave it out as it being one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>library's</b> books is self-evident.|$|R
5|$|Both Bach's {{autograph}} {{score and}} the parts {{used for the}} cantata's first performance survive. The score, previously owned by Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, Philipp Spitta and Paul Wittgenstein, among others, came in the possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Library</b> of Congress in 1948. The original parts remained in Leipzig, where they were entrusted to the Bach Archive in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Hatfield Library is {{the main}} library on Willamette's campus, with the law school's library as the only other library at the school. The {{director}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>library</b> is Craig Milberg, who heads a staff of 18 employees, of which 10 are librarian. Regular circulation transactions totaled 14,158 in 2015, with an additional 1,923 in reference requests.|$|E
5|$|In 1802, George hired Reverend Thomas Frognall Dibdin as an {{official}} librarian {{to look after the}} collection and the library contains his many catalogues entitled Aedes Althorpianæ, documenting the books <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>library.</b> The collection became so enormous that the massive library became inadequate to hold the contents, and books began being stored along the long picture gallery on the first floor above it. By the time of George John's death in 1834, he had amassed one of the largest private collections in Europe of some 110,000 volumes. Alcoves were added to the ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>library</b> during the Holland restoration, creating extra room for the growing collection.|$|E
5000|$|In 2001, ESLS {{initiated}} EasiCat, an [...] "online shared automated catalog <b>of</b> all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> items {{owned by}} all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>libraries</b> and <b>the</b> bookmobile."

5|$|The Lindley Library, {{the largest}} horticultural library {{in the world}} and named after the British {{botanist}} John Lindley (1799–1865), was established in 1868 by the acquisition of Lindley's 1,300 volumes upon his death. It had recently undergone considerable change. In 1930, the library had been rehoused in a new floor added to the Society's Vincent Square headquarters, but the role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>library</b> was somewhat downgraded. Frederick Chittenden had been appointed as Keeper <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Library</b> (1930–1939), and Hutchinson reported directly to him. Stearn related that when he reported for duty, Hutchinson was completely unaware of the appointment of his new assistant.|$|E

50|$|On May 1, 1876, Solberg {{began working}} in <b>the</b> <b>Library</b> <b>of</b> Congress as a cataloguer. In 1876, he became part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Library's</b> law {{department}} staff, despite {{not being a}} lawyer. While there, he played {{an active role in}} the direction and control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Library's</b> copyright registration and deposit functions.

5|$|Two manuscripts are {{recorded}} {{in an old}} catalogue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>library</b> of Durham; they are described as cronica duo Anglica. In addition, Parker included a manuscript called Hist. Angliae Saxonica in his gifts but the manuscript that included this, now Cambridge University Library MS.

5|$|After the Japanese {{surrender}} in September 1945, Lieutenant-Colonel G. Archey of the British Military Administration {{took over}} Directorship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Library</b> and museum on 6 September. The Library only suffered minimal losses and damages {{during the three}} and a half years of Japanese Occupation, as the Japanese preserved the Library well due to its respected reputation in academia. Compared to other libraries in Malaya which lost nearly half of their collections, only some 500 reference books were looted according to a stocktake done after the war.|$|E

5|$|Another bust of {{particular}} value is the marble portrait of Armand Gaston, sculpted in 1730–1731 in Rome by Edmé Bouchardon. It is also {{displayed in the}} library. The floor of the chapel is partly covered with a 1745 imitation of a Turkish carpet, woven in the Aubusson manufactory and bearing in its centre the coat of arms of Armand Gaston deRohan. The carpet covering the large table in the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>library</b> was woven in Portuguese India around 1730. It {{was given to the}} Cathedral chapter after 1806 and sold to the Musée de Cluny in 1865 but was returned to the city of Strasbourg on permanent loan in 1939.|$|E

Many new programs and majors were inaugurated, as were important social outreach efforts. New ties were established with the private and industrial sectors, and a growing partnership developed with federal and state governments in creating programs for the economically and educationally disadvantaged.|$|E
