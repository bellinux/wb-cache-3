This is a mathematical relation that exists in certain physical theories between a class <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> called bosons and a class <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> called fermions. Roughly speaking, fermions are the constituents of matter, while bosons mediate interactions between particles. In theories with supersymmetry, each boson has a counterpart which is a fermion, and vice versa. When supersymmetry is imposed as a local symmetry, one automatically obtains a quantum mechanical theory that includes gravity. Such a theory is called a supergravity theory.|$|E

We think all particles {{can be divided}} into three kinds: The first kind <b>of</b> <b>particle</b> is its velocity in the range of 0 ≤ v < c, e. g. electron, atom, molecule and so on (c is light velocity, i. e., the limit velocity of the first kind <b>of</b> <b>particle).</b> The second kind <b>of</b> <b>particle</b> is its velocity in the range of 0 ≤ v < c_m 1, e. g. photon (c_m 1 is the limit velocity of the second kind <b>of</b> <b>particle).</b> The third kind <b>of</b> <b>particle</b> is its velocity in the range of c≤ v < c_m 2, e. g. tachyon, and muonic neutrinos (c_m 2 is the limit velocity of the third kind <b>of</b> <b>particle).</b> The first kind <b>of</b> <b>particle</b> is described by the special relativity.

5|$|A lattice gas {{automaton}} is {{a cellular}} automaton designed {{to simulate the}} motion <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> in a fluid or an ideal gas. In such a system, gas particles move on straight lines with constant velocity, until undergoing elastic collision with other particles.

5|$|As {{shown in}} the figure, and as {{originally}} described by , Rule 184 {{may be used to}} model deposition <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> onto a surface. In this model, one has a set <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> that occupy a subset of the positions in a square lattice oriented diagonally (the darker particles in the figure). If a particle is present at some position of the lattice, the lattice positions below and to the right, and below and {{to the left of the}} particle must also be filled, so the filled part of the lattice extends infinitely downward to the left and right. The boundary between filled and unfilled positions (the thin black line in the figure) is interpreted as modeling a surface, onto which more particles may be deposited. At each time step, the surface grows by the deposition of new particles in each local minimum of the surface; that is, at each position where it is possible to add one new particle that has existing particles below it on both sides (the lighter particles in the figure).|$|E

We focus particularly on the fluctuations <b>of</b> <b>particle</b> activity, which {{is defined as the}} number <b>of</b> moving <b>particles</b> per unit bed length. Based on a stochastic model recently proposed by Ancey 2013, we derive the second moment <b>of</b> <b>particle</b> activity analytically; that is the spatial correlation functions <b>of</b> <b>particle</b> activity. From these expressions, we show that large moving particle clusters can develop spatially. Also, we provide evidence that fluctuations <b>of</b> <b>particle</b> activity are scale-dependent. Two characteristic lengths emerge from the model: a saturation length ℓ_sat describing the length needed for a perturbation in particle activity to relax to the homogeneous solution, and a correlation length ℓ_c describing the typical size <b>of</b> moving <b>particle</b> clusters. A dimensionless Péclet number can also be defined according to the transport model. Three different experimental data sets are used to test the theoretical results. We show that the stochastic model describes spatial patterns <b>of</b> <b>particle</b> activity well at all scales. In particular, we show that ℓ_c and ℓ_sat may be relatively large compared to typical scales encountered in bed load experiments (grain diameter, water depth, bed form wavelength, flume length [...] .) suggesting that the spatial fluctuations <b>of</b> <b>particle</b> activity have a non-negligible impact on the average transport process...|$|R
