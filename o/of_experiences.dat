5|$|Although Dawkins {{invented the}} term meme, {{he has not}} claimed that the idea was entirely novel, {{and there have been}} other {{expressions}} for similar ideas in the past. For instance, John Laurent has suggested that the term may have derived from the work of the little-known German biologist Richard Semon. In 1904, Semon published Die Mneme (which appeared in English in 1924 as The Mneme). This book discusses the cultural transmission <b>of</b> <b>experiences,</b> with insights parallel to those of Dawkins. Laurent also found the term mneme used in Maurice Maeterlinck's The Life of the White Ant (1926), and has highlighted the similarities to Dawkins's concept.|$|E
5|$|Like many of Verne's novels, {{the play}} is deeply imbued with themes of initiation, echoing the {{traditional}} mythic pattern of a young hero coming of age and reaching maturity through a dangerous and transformative journey. In Journey Through the Impossible, the young Georges, initially trapped by obsessions {{similar to those that}} drove his father mad, resolves his inner torments during a harrowing series <b>of</b> <b>experiences</b> in which Ox and Volsius compete as substitute father-figures. Both father-figures are highly symbolic: Ox is a sinister tempter representing knowledge and science, balancing the Guardian Angel Volsius.|$|E
5|$|Norman pioneered {{a form of}} past-life therapy, {{teaching}} her disciples how to recall details <b>of</b> <b>experiences</b> from their past incarnations. These recollections contributed to the group's mythology, which developed over time with student input. Unarius' members occasionally recalled crimes that they had committed in past lives, including times they harmed incarnations of Ruth Norman. The students sometimes acted out and filmed scenes from their previous incarnations, an experience that participants found therapeutic; they cited this benefit as proof that the events were real. Norman's therapy, according to R. George Kirkpatrick of San Diego State University and Tumminia, differed from most New Age past-life therapies {{in the way that}} it wove her followers into the group's narrative.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{oriented}} to The Intensity <b>of</b> <b>Experience</b> {{and its role}} in The Dramaturgy of Experiential Courses. The main concepts: The Intensity <b>of</b> <b>Experience</b> and The Dynamics <b>of</b> <b>Experience,</b> are described in the theoretical part. At first, the author defines the concept of The Intensity <b>of</b> <b>Experience,</b> furthermore she describes diferences between The Intensity and Dynamics <b>of</b> <b>Experience</b> in order to implement both concepts into the context of Experiential Education. The second chapter is aimed at Experiential Courses, their background and history, principles of Experiential Education and Dramaturgy of Experiential Education Courses. The main part of the thesis is the third chapter, which is devoted to quantitative-qualitative research. This research is focused on The Intensity <b>of</b> <b>Experience</b> evaluated by the participants, which the author further compares with The Intensity <b>of</b> <b>Experience</b> intended by instructors. The research results indicate differences between The Intensity <b>of</b> <b>Experience</b> intended by the instructor and The Intensity <b>of</b> <b>Experience</b> that participants felt after courses...|$|R
40|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> has two sides: {{it implies}} that {{knowledge}} is acquired through the senses, and {{it implies that}} knowledge is acquired over time. Different traditions of thought have emphasized either {{one or the other}} of these two aspects <b>of</b> <b>experience,</b> with epistemology gravitating toward an idea <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> as perception and political philosophy gravitating toward an idea <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> as repetition. In this paper, I argue that Hume's great innovation consisted in taking the notion <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> traditionally associated with political philosophy and applying it to epistemology. Meanwhile, Kant aimed his critique at the traditional epistemological notion <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> and thus failed to appreciate Hume's originality.  </p...|$|R

The book covers themes of the children's education, leisure, religion, transitions to freedmen, and work expectations.

5|$|Additionally, the {{development}} of Theory of Mind {{may play a role}} in emotional development. Theory of Mind is the ability to know that the experience of knowledge and intention lies behind human actions such as facial expressions. Although it is reported that very young infants have different responses to humans than to non-human objects, Theory of Mind develops relatively gradually and possibly results from predictable interactions with adults. However, some ability of this kind must be in place before mutual communication through gaze or other gesture can occur, as it does by seven to nine months. Some neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, have been attributed to the absence of the mental functions that underlie Theory of Mind. It is possible that the congenital absence of this ability, or the lack <b>of</b> <b>experiences</b> with caregivers who communicate in a predictable fashion, could underlie {{the development}} of reactive attachment disorder.|$|E

5|$|The East End {{has been}} the subject of {{parliamentary}} commissions and other examinations of social conditions since the 19th century, as seen in Henry Mayhew's London Labour and the London Poor (1851) and Charles Booth's Life and Labour of the People in London (third, expanded edition 1902-3, in 17 volumes). Arthur Morrison's novel A Child of the Jago (1896) is set in Bethnal Green, and recounts the story of a boy growing up in a slum surrounding Arnold Circus. Narrative accounts <b>of</b> <b>experiences</b> amongst the East End poor were also written by Jack London in The People of the Abyss (1903), by George Orwell in parts of his novel Down and Out in Paris and London, recounting his own experiences in the 1930s, as well as the Jewish writer Emanuel Litvinoff in his autobiographical novel Journey Through a Small Planet set in the 1930s. A further detailed study of Bethnal Green was carried out in the 1950s by sociologists Michael Young and Peter Willmott, in Family and Kinship in East London.|$|E

40|$|The article {{examines}} the reception of Kantian conception <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> in Martin Heidegger’s book Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics. The context of Immanuel Kant’s theory <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> forms the basis for collation of Kant’s and Heidegger’s philosophies. Epistemological and metaphysical components of Kantian conception <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> are extracted. Two main Kant’s theoretical distinctions are discussed: {{the difference between the}} sensual matter <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> and conceptual form of experience; and the difference between the thing-in-itself and appearance. The research is focused on Kantian understanding <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> or empirical cognition, which is a process of synthesis of sensuous data and concepts. Collation of Kant’s and Heidegger’s philosophies and evaluation of Heidegger’s interpretational position appeals to theoretical contexts of metaphysical nominalism and metaphysical realism. The basic conclusion states that Heidegger’s interpretation of Kant’s theory <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> is transfused by the premises of Heidegger’s fundamental Dasein ontology. These premises determine significant transformations of Kant’s philosophy and the omission of some aspects of Kant’s theory <b>of</b> <b>experience...</b>|$|R
