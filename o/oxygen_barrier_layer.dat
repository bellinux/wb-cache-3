The thermal conductivity of as-sprayed YAG/YSZ coatings was reduced due to excessive porosity and amorphous {{areas in the}} YAG layer. After long-term heat treatments, the conductivity of the multilayer was unaffected {{by the presence of}} YAG. Sintering and recrystallization of the amorphous YAG regions occurred during high-temperature heat treatments. While YAG itself possesses excellent phase stability, its presence also improved the phase stability of zirconia near the YAG/YSZ interface, inhibiting the outward diffusion of yttrium from high-yttria t-ZrO_ 2 The YAG layer reduced the NiCoCrAlY bond-coat oxidation rate by a factor of three during isothermalfurnace tests conducted at 1200 ° C...|$|E
40|$|A three-layer {{laminate}} fi lm {{was developed}} {{with the following}} structure: polyethylene terephthalate (PET) /fi sh gelatin (FG) –nanoclay composite/low-density polyethylene (LDPE). The FG–nanoclay composite material functioned as the <b>oxygen</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> and demonstrated comparable oxygen barrier properties when compared with a similar laminate utilizing ethylene vinyl alcohol as the barrier layer at a relative humidity (RH) of up to 50 %. The introduction of nanometer-sized fi ller clay into the FG matrix lowered the oxygen permeability (OP) because of the tortuosity effect of the clay particles. In addition, the FG–nanoclay composite fi lm exhibited bond strengths similar to both LDPE and PET. The hydrophilic nature of FG signifi cantly increases OP under high (> 50 %) RH conditions. However, this new FG laminate fi lm could be a possible alternative for packaging designers desiring a more sustainable packaging material for low-R...|$|E

The data are related to “Tuning of co-extrusion processing conditions and film layout to optimize the performances of PA/PE multilayer nanocomposite films for food packaging” by Garofalo et al.

Nanocomposite multilayer films, with different relative layer thicknesses and clay types, were produced using a laboratory scale co-extrusion blown-film equipment and were analyzed in terms of transport to oxygen and water vapor, mechanical properties and overall migration. The results have shown that all the multilayer hybrid films, based on the copolyamide layer filled with Cloisite 30 B, displayed the most significant oxygen barrier improvements and the best mechanical properties compared to the unfilled films. No significant alteration of the overall migration values was observed, as expectable [2]; [3]; [4].

40|$|Improving barrier {{properties}} {{through the use}} of nanocomposites is an important area of research, especially for the food packaging industry. In this work, Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) /Low density Poly Ethylene (LDPE) nanocomposites were synthesized as the <b>oxygen</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> through the co-extrusion process. The Oxygen permeability of the nanocomposite with 4 % of TiO 2 decreased for about 16 % compared to the pristine LDPE. Furthermore, the rancidity of almonds in the packaging which is made of the former is about 78 % less than the latter. Therefore, from the data obtained from the permeation, mechanical and degradation experiments, it can be concluded that these nanocomposites provide promising applications as O 2 -barrier and anti-degradation agents in food packaging...|$|R

40|$|Providing {{a package}} that can {{actively}} participate in prolonging the product shelf life of orange juice adds value, both financially and nutritionally, to the product and to the package. The code date and shelf life of orange juice is in part determined by {{the ability of the}} product to maintain the level of vitamin C as stated on the nutritional label. Vitamin C deteriorates in the presence of oxygen; therefore, removal of oxygen from the package will decelerate the process of oxidation thereby diminishing the loss of vitamin C and prolonging the quality of the orange juice. The refrigerated shelf life of orange juice packaged in a polyethylene-coated paperboard gable top carton generally has a limited shelf life of three weeks. The addition of an <b>oxygen</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>layer,</b> such as nylon, on the inside structure of the carton can extend the shelf life of orange juice to 6 weeks. It has been our finding that at eight weeks orange juice packaged in a gable top carton with an Oxygen Scavenger (OSPTM) lining maintained 35 % more vitamin C than the standard barrier carton.

40|$|Green {{additives}} such as prodegradants {{based on}} natural fatty acids and iron {{can improve the}} environmental profile of thermoplastic packaging materials. We present two studies in which this is demonstrated. In the first study, {{the addition of a}} green prodegradant to a 5 -layer gas barrier laminate during processing provided a laminate with significantly reduced oxygen transmission due to the resulting oxygen-consuming degradation process. The result shows that material reduction and cost efficiency of packaging laminates can be combined, since 5 -layer laminates with reduced <b>oxygen</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> thickness and retained gas barrier properties are feasible. The products are interesting from an ecological and economic aspect. In the second study, the addition of a green prodegradant to several qualities of polypropylene that are used in packaging applications leads to materials that are readily degraded in accelerated weathering. The molecular weight of the modified polypropylenes after 830 hours of accelerated weathering is reduced from typically 80. 000 [*]g/mole to 1. 500 – 2. 500 [*]g/mole. At such molecular weight levels, digestion by microorganisms is feasible. The mild prodegradant used in the study does not lead to degradation during processing.

A feasible solution to overcome the problem of possible nanoparticles migration can be the use of a functional barrier between the nanomaterial and the food. In this work, multilayer packaging films, incorporating a layered silicate/polyamide nanocomposite (as <b>oxygen</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>layer)</b> and low-density polyethylene (as moisture resistant and sealable layer) in direct contact with food, were produced by a lab-scale blown co-extrusion equipment using different processing conditions and film layouts, to determine the key parameters for performance improvement and to assess their potential applicability on an industrial scale. In particular, a copolyamide 6, 66 was used as polymer matrix and two organomodified layered silicates (Cloisite 30 B and Dellite 43 B) were selected as nanofillers. The results demonstrated the potential technological interest of the proposed packaging solutions in terms of increased performances and ecofriendliness because all the multilayer hybrid films, particularly the ones filled with Cloisite 30 B, display significant improvements in barrier and mechanical properties not only with respect to the corresponding unfilled systems, but also compared to similar PA/PE commercial films. The observed increments, up to 60 % for oxygen barrier and 55 % for stiffness, are more relevant {{in the case of the}} films with the thinner nanocomposite layer. Moreover, no detectable changes in film ductility, optical properties, and overall migration behavior were measured as consequence of nanofiller addition...|$|E

An approach {{to increase the}} shelf life of the {{packaged food}}, while exploiting the advantages of flexible packaging, is to use flexible multi-layer polyethylene (PE) -based films including a <b>barrier</b> <b>layer.</b> This paper reviews different <b>oxygen</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> used in Doy Pack flexible pouches for fruit puree and presents the impact of storage conditions on the organoleptic properties.

40|$|Abstract. The {{concept of}} the {{diffusion}} barrier coating system (DBC system) is summarized and the latest results are presented. The DBC system is comprised of alloy substrate/diffusion barrier/Al-reservoir/an external scale. Diffusion flux (JAl) of Al through the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> will be given approximately by JAl = DAl x SAl x (CAl/x), where DAl and SAl are the diffusion coefficient and solubility limit of Al in the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer,</b> respectively as well as CAl / x is driving force given by the concentration difference across the barrier (CAl) divided by {{the thickness of the}} <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> (x). A slow diffusion flux can be obtained by using low values of DAl, SAl, or (CAl / x). Accordingly, a selection of a <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> with lower DAl and SAl is essential. A low driving force is also an important factor, and can be achieved by using lower CAl with a constant <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> thickness x. At higher temperatures, however, the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> can react with the alloy substrate and Al-reservoir layer, resulting in gradual degradation of the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer.</b> This means that the thickness x of the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> tends to decrease and may finally disappear.

It was observed that copper can penetrate through both electroless-plated and LIP Ni <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> in LDSE cells that have been heated for 5 hours at 200 °C or 400 °C, followed by quenching in ethylene glycol (fast cooling). Current-voltage measurements were used to characterise the electrical performance of LDSE cells with different nickel <b>barrier</b> <b>layers.</b> Significant degradations in cell efficiency, fill factor and open-circuit voltage were observed for LDSE cells with electroless-plated nickel <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> after heating at 200 °C and subsequent quenching in ethylene glycol. In the worst case, the fill factor was reduced from 66 % to 31 %, causing severe efficiency degradation. However, the fill factor of cells with LIP nickel <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> were only reduced from 66 % to 58 % under the same conditions. When cells were cooled slowly the electrical performance of the cells was only slightly affected and was independent of the type of nickel <b>barrier</b> <b>layer.</b> Furthermore, LDSE cells with electroless-plated nickel <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> that were originally heat-treated followed by fast cooling, were exposed to a second heat treatment at 250 °C for 2 hours, followed by slow cooling.

However, on slow cooling (which is likely in the field), the copper can out-diffuse to regions of the cell where the cell&# 146;s electrical performance is not degraded.

Intermediate layers are located between the outer layer and the substrate and include a mullite-containing layer and a chemical <b>barrier</b> <b>layer.</b> The mullite-containing layer includes 1) mullite or 2) mullite and an alkaline earth metal aluminosilicate. The chemical <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> is located between the mullite-containing layer and the outer <b>layer.</b> The chemical <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> includes {{at least one of}} mullite, hafnia, hafnium silicate and rare earth silicate (e. g., at least one of RE. sub. 2 SiO. sub. 5 and RE. sub. 2 Si. sub. 2 O. sub. 7 where RE is Sc or Yb). The multilayer article is characterized by the combination of the chemical <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> and by its lack of a layer consisting essentially of barium strontium aluminosilicate between the mullite-containing layer and the chemical <b>barrier</b> <b>layer.</b> Such a barium strontium aluminosilicate layer may undesirably lead to the formation of a low melting glass or unnecessarily increase the layer thickness with concomitant reduced durability of the multilayer article. In particular, the chemical <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> may include at least one of hafnia, hafnium silicate and rare earth silicate...|$|R
40|$|Variability in {{the surface}} {{isothermal}} and mixed layers of the Sulu and Celebes Seas is examined using the conductivity–temperature–depth data from the Navy’s Master Oceanographic Observational Data Set (MOODS). Vertical gradient is calculated to determine isothermal layer depth with a criterion of 0. 058 C m 21 for temperature profiles and mixed layer depth with a criterion of 0. 015 kg m 24 for density profiles. When the isothermal layer depth {{is larger than the}} mixed <b>layer</b> depth, the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> occurs. This study shows that the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> occurs often in the Sulu and Celebes Seas. In the Sulu Sea, the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> has seasonal variability with a minimum occurrence (38 %) and a minimum thickness (3 m) in May and a maximum occurrence (94 %) and a maximum thickness (36. 5 m) in September. In the Celebes Sea, the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> thickness changes from a maximum (49. 7 – 62. 0 m) in March–April to a minimum (9. 6 m) in June. Possible mechanisms responsible for the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> formation are discussed. In the Sulu Sea, the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> may be formed by both rainfall and stratification; in the Celebes Sea, a rain-formed mechanism seems a major factor. 1...|$|R
