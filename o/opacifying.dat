25|$|Colourants/Opacifiers: These can be {{naturally}} {{present in}} the glass due to impurities in the raw materials, e.g. {{in the case of}} green/blue-green glass which results from the presence of iron in the sand. Other colourants are likely to be deliberate additions to the glass melt of small quantities of mineral-rich material or in some cases slags from metalworking processes. The elements in ancient glass that affect its appearance are mainly iron, manganese, cobalt, copper, tin and antimony. The presence or absence of lead is also important, while it doesn’t produce a colour itself (except in the form lead-tin oxide or lead-antimony oxide) it can change the hue of other colourants. In addition when added to opaque glasses it ensures that the colourants form in a controlled way and are uniformly distributed. Opacity in glass can be due to a number of factors; intensity of colour, bubbles in the glass or the inclusion of <b>opacifying</b> agents, such as tin (SnO2 & PbSnO3) and antimony (Ca2Sb2O7 & CaSb2O6 & Pb2Sb2O7).|$|E

40|$|AIM: To study forward light-scattering {{characteristics}} of calcified explanted intraocular lenses (IOLs) (Aquasense, Ophthalmic Innovation International Ontario). METHODS: The {{amount of light}} scattered by the <b>opacified</b> IOLs was measured using a validated in vitro set-up for angles from 1. 7 degrees to 22 degrees. This set-up gives results directly comparable with straylight values as valid for the in vivo situation. RESULTS: Straylight is highest at large angles and declines steeply approaching 0 degrees angle. This corresponds to the in vivo findings that <b>opacified</b> IOLs cause important visual complaints but have little effect on visual acuity. At 7. 5 degrees, log (s) is around 1. 8 and 2. 9 for the two lenses respectively. This corresponds to 8 x and 100 x increases in straylight values compared with values in young, normal eyes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} the preoperative and postoperative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), {{as well as of the}} incidence of perioperative and postoperative complications after <b>opacified</b> hydrogel intraocular lens (IOL) exchange. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We exchanged <b>opacified</b> hydrogel IOLs (Hydroview H 60 M, Bausch; Lomb) in 55 patients (55 eyes). Preoperative and postoperative BCVA were compared. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were recorded. Follow-up period ranged from 3 months to 24 months. RESULTS: Mean BCVA improved significantly from 0. 05 preoperatively to 0. 4 at 3 months postoperatively and to 0. 2 at the end of the follow-up period. Forty patients (72. 7 %) reported visual improvement. The procedure was uneventful in 30 eyes (54. 5 %) with complete removal of the <b>opacified</b> IOL optics and haptics. Intraoperative complications included partial zonular dehiscence in 10 eyes (18. 2 %), en block capsular bag-IOL extraction in 2 eyes (3. 6 %), posterior capsule rupture in 2 eyes (3. 6 %), hyphema in 3 eyes (5. 5 %), retained haptics in 8 eyes (14. 5 %). Postoperative complications included corneal decompensation in 5 eyes (9. 1 %), cystoid macular edema in 15 eyes (27. 3 %), elevated intraocular pressure in 6 eyes (10. 9 %), and retinal detachment in 1 eye (1. 8 %).

We report on the analyses of <b>opacified</b> Euromaxx ALI 313 Y and ALI 313 IOLs (Argonoptics, Germany) using light and scanning electron microscopy, X-ray spectroscopy and optical bench analysis. Methods: <b>Opacified</b> Euromaxx ALI 313 Y and ALI 313 IOLs were explanted after patients presented with a decrease in visual acuity. The explants were sent to our laboratory and examined using light and scanning electron microscopy. The composition of the deposits was analysed using X-ray spectroscopy. The optical quality of the intraocular lens (IOL) was assessed using the OptiSpheric IOL PRO optical bench (Trioptics GmbH Wedel, Germany). Modulation transfer function (MTF) was measured at all spatial frequencies and United States Air Force (USAF) 1951 resolution target pictures were documented. Results: Macroscopically, the entire optic was <b>opacified</b> in all IOLs. Light and scanning electron microscopy revealed numerous fine, granular, crystalline-like deposits, which were always distributed in a line parallel to the anterior and posterior surfaces of the IOLs. X-ray spectroscopy could prove the deposits consisted of Calcium and Phosphate. Measurements in the optical bench showed deterioration of MTF values at all spatial frequencies and the USAF target pictures demonstrated a significant reduction of brightness as well as resolution with the <b>opacified</b> IOLs. Conclusions: The calcification of hydrophilic IOLs only occurs rarely. The exact chemical composition of the deposits can be assessed by means of X-ray spectroscopy. Optical quality analysis of the explanted Euromaxx ALI 313 Y and ALI 313 IOLs showed significant reduction of MTF values, which was confirmed by USAF target pictures...|$|R

50|$|Tin-glazed pottery, or faience, {{originated}} in Iraq in the 9th century, {{from where it}} spread to Egypt, Persia and Spain before reaching Italy in the Renaissance, Holland in the 16th century and England, France and other European countries shortly after. Important regional styles in Europe include: Hispano-Moresque, maiolica, Delftware, and English Delftware. By the High Middle Ages the Hispano-Moresque ware of Al-Andaluz was the most sophisticated pottery being produced in Europe, with elaborate decoration. It introduced tin-glazing to Europe, which {{was developed in the}} Italian Renaissance in maiolica. Tin-glazed pottery was taken up in the Netherlands from the 16th to the 18th centuries, the potters making household, decorative pieces and tiles in vast numbers, usually with blue painting on a white ground. Dutch potters took tin-glazed pottery to the British Isles, where it was made between about 1550 and 1800. In France, tin-glaze was begun in 1690 at Quimper in Brittany, followed in Rouen, Strasbourg and Lunéville. The development of white, or near white, firing bodies in Europe from the late 18th century, such as Creamware by Josiah Wedgwood and porcelain, reduced the demand for Delftware, faience and majolica. Today, tin oxide usage in glazes finds limited use in conjunction with other, lower cost <b>opacifying</b> agents, although it is generally restricted to specialist low temperature applications and use by studio potters, including Picasso who produced pottery using tin glazes.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{effectiveness}} of MR urography (MRU) with that of ultrasonography (US) in the evaluation of urinary tract when this failed to <b>opacify</b> during excretory urography (EXU). Materials and Methods: Twelve urinary tracts in 11 patients were studied. In each case, during EXU, the urinary system failed to <b>opacify</b> within one hour of the injection of contrast media, and US revealed dilatation of the pelvocalyceal system. Patients underwent MRU, using a HASTE sequence with the breath-hold technique; multi-slice acquisition was then performed, and the images were reconstructed using maximal intensity projection. Each set of images was evaluated by three radiologists to determine the presence, level, and cause of urinary tract obstruction. Results: Obstruction was present in all twelve cases, and in all of these, MRU accurately demonstrated its level. In this respect, however, US was successful in only ten. The cause of obstruction was determined by MRU in eight cases, but by US in only six. In all of these six, MRU also successfully demonstrated the cause. Conclusion: MRU is an effective modality for evaluation of the urinary tract when this fails to <b>opacify</b> during EXU, and appears to be superior to US in demonstrating the level and cause of obstruction.
