From the results, {{it was found that}} the coefficient of discharge is affected by geometrical characteristics represented by radius of the weir and the angle of inclination with the wall of the channel. It was noticed that the increase in the radius of the weir lead to a low discharge coefficient of the cylindrical weir.

40|$|The {{problem of}} <b>oblique</b> <b>cylindrical</b> linearized wave motion is {{considered}} for a fluid of infinite depth or finite constant depth {{in the presence of}} an impermeable cylindrical wall and coaxial porous wall immersed vertically in the fluid. The motion is generated once by the oscillations, which are periodic in time and in ÃŽÂ¸-direction, of the impermeable wall and next by the porous wall. The velocity potentials have been found in closed forms in the different regions of the fluid and then calculating the hydrodynamic pressure distribution on the porous wall and the profile of the free surface. The scattering problem of oblique waves is then considered. A wave trapping phenomenon is investigated. Numerical results are given to the case of radial incident waves and the case when the angle of incident waves is 30 Ã‚Â° to the radial direction...|$|R
50|$|The National Maps of Switzerland are {{a set of}} {{official}} map series designed, edited and distributed by Swisstopo, the Swiss Federal Office of Topography.

40|$|No map can {{perfectly}} {{reproduce the}} earth. The globe comes nearest to accomplishing this. Yet maps are valued {{more than the}} globe today because of their vastly superior utility. That the Mercator projection more than all others has been continuously used through the years {{may be explained by}} the fact that navigators believed loxodromics was the best means of navigation. It seems to me, the Mercator projection should be replaced by any one of several others based upon orthodromics, since they are more useful in this Air Age. Perhaps both inertia from the past and ignorance of other map projections caused the delay in replacement of the older map projections. In the new Air Age in which all of us live the most useful maps are those which fulfill the following three conditions: 1) maps which give great circles as straight lines; 2) maps which give true azimuths; 3) maps which locate the North Pole somewhere in them. Even though a single projection cannot meet these three requirements, I believe the oblique equidistant azimuthal projection, the <b>oblique</b> simple <b>cylindrical</b> projection and the <b>oblique</b> equal-area <b>cylindrical</b> projection are to be recommended as best suited for the purpose. In the comparison of the simple cylindrical projection with the equidistant azimuthal projection, the former is found to have a determinative advantage in that it necessitates neither a scale nor a protractor as the result of starightening up the parallels, while, in the latter, its user requires both. The equal-area cylindrical projection has even more merit than the simple cylindrical projection. In the former, the areal relationships on the earth are kept true. The distances from the centre of the projection can be easily read on the Y-axis although the distance relationships on the earth are no longer preserved. In terms of the conventional concept of maps, the shape distortions at the margins of each of these three projections are so conspicuous that they would hardly be put in the category of maps. This is particularly true of the last two projections. They may as well be called nomographs rather than maps. However, it is inevitable that maps should be inclined towards nomographs if their special qualities are to be maintained. The author feels that out-moded maps should not be perpetuated since they are not the most useful projections...|$|R

It is flesh-colored, painted with radiating white streaks, the apex blackish-violet. The granulate whorls are a little convex, the last one rounded-angulate, above a little concave. The granules of the surface are hemispherical, closely crowded. The superior whorls are entirely flat and contain 6 or 8 granulate cinguli, close, separated by a narrow granulate line. The base of the shell is granose-cingulate, with about 8 principal cinguli, alternating with smaller ones. The aperture rhomdoidal and depressed. The outer lip is superficially sulcate within, corresponding to the principal lirae of the outer surface.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} two {{relatively}} unexplored types of surface defects on silicon nitride balls – ‘star’ type defects and ‘missing material’. The main {{objective of this}} research is to determine failure modes and the critical or tolerable defect sizes for rolling bearing applications. This is achieved by means of both experimental and numerical techniques (for finding crack initiation location). A modified four-ball machine is used for the rolling contact fatigue experiments on star features and missing material defects (both during manufacturing process and artificially produced) on the surface of silicon nitride balls. Experiments are conducted at different loads (3. 8 - 4. 8 GPa), lubrication types, specific speed (7500 rpm) and temperature conditions (75 °C) to find rolling contact fatigue limitations in relation to these defects. Laser micromachining is used to produce precise holes and trenches to simulate missing material. Two different types of bearing grade silicon nitride are tested to determine tolerance and failure modes in rolling contact fatigue. Scanning electron microscopy, light microscopy and white light interferometry are used for surface analysis and topography. Post-experiment analysis in the star feature experiments has shown that star like radial cracks are prone to develop into missing material by internal fracture over the extent of the star in lubricated rolling contact. Lubrication quality or film thickness and orientation of the pre-existing cracks to the rolling direction influenced the damage process and severity. In the case of missing material experiments, samples with different diameters (50 - 100 μm), depths (5 - 50 μm) and shape (right <b>cylindrical,</b> conical and <b>oblique</b> <b>cylindrical)</b> were tested. It has been confirmed that, apart from the main experimental parameters like applied pressure, cavity diameter and depth, parameters such as cavity base profile, shape and cavity location and orientation on the contact track are important for rolling contact fatigue of silicon nitride material. Replica produced cavity base profiles to investigate failure reasons. Cross-sectioning also gave very good insight of surface and subsurface features both before and after testing (including un-failed specimens). Incipient spalls on tested samples provided the information to understand the failure mechanism (mainly spalling) in the material. FEM is used for finding stress fields at surface and sub-surface positions and ultimately predicting the location and position of crack initiation. 2 D (Axi-symmetric and plane strain) and 3 D models are developed to compare the results, whereas static versus quasi static analysis is presented to examine the effect of rolling. Models are verified using classical contact theory. Hydrostatic pressure effects are also successfully modeled using the finite element analysis approach. Fluid elements modeling on the solid interface of the cavity produced a different stress field and have indicated the location of crack initiation...|$|R

The plane whorls are angulated with a sharp carina a little above the sutures, the last one biangulate with a second carina. The sculpture of the upper surface consists of five, fine thread-like or hair-like granulate spirals, the last forming the sharp carina over the suture. There are in the interstices finer granulose lines. The base of the shell is a little convex with 9 to 10 concentric, little elevated smooth lirae, nearly as broad as their interstices.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was performed to}} elucidate the fundamental physics of shock-induced mixing for a simple three-dimensional interface. The interface studied consists of a gravity stabilized SF 6 -based heavy gas jet that produced a circular column with a diffuse interface into the surrounding air. The effects of density gradient (Atwood number, A), shock strength (Mach number, M), and column inclination angle (theta) were examined. Concentration was measured using Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) of an acetone vapor tracer mixed with the heavy gas jet and illuminated by a pulsed Nd-YAG laser. Shocks with Mach numbers of 1. 13, 1. 5, 1. 7, and 2. 0 were used for inclinations of 0 degrees (planar normal shock wave), 20 degrees and 30 degrees. Columns with Atwood numbers of 0. 25, 0. 4, and 0. 60 were tested at Mach 1. 7 for inclinations of 0 degrees and 20 degrees. The <b>oblique</b> shock-accelerated <b>cylindrical</b> interface produced a typical Richtmyer- Meshkov instability (RMI) consisting of a primary counter-rotating vortices. The streamwise extent of the vortex pair in the centerline plane (cross-section) images of the column {{is proportional to the}} square root of A divided by the square root of M, regardless of oblique shock angle for theta 1. 13. Transition to turbulent, or well-mixed flow, was determined by analyzing the second-order structure function of intensity (I 2 (r)) in the PLIF images.

40|$|We {{present the}} new general-relativistic {{magnetohydrodynamics}} (GRMHD) {{capabilities of the}} Einstein Toolkit, an open-source community-driven numerical relativity and computational relativistic astrophysics code. The GRMHD extension of the Toolkit builds upon previous releases and implements the evolution of relativistic magnetised fluids in the ideal MHD limit in fully dynamical spacetimes using the same shock-capturing techniques previously applied to hydrodynamical evolution. In {{order to maintain the}} divergence-free character of the magnetic field, the code implements both hyperbolic divergence cleaning and constrained transport schemes. We present test results for a number of MHD tests in Minkowski and curved spacetimes. Minkowski tests include aligned and <b>oblique</b> planar shocks, <b>cylindrical</b> explosions, magnetic rotors, Alfvén waves and advected loops, as well as a set of tests designed to study the response of the divergence cleaning scheme to numerically generated monopoles. We study the code's performance in curved spacetimes with spherical accretion onto a black hole on a fixed background spacetime and in fully dynamical spacetimes by evolutions of a magnetised polytropic neutron star and of the collapse of a magnetised stellar core. Our results agree well with exact solutions where these are available and we demonstrate convergence. All code and input files used to generate the results are available on [URL] This makes our work fully reproducible and provides new users with an introduction to applications of the code.

40|$|The author {{reported}} {{stress analysis}} of infinite isotropic {{plate with a}} cylindrical circular hole and oblique hole. The present work deals with infinite isotropic plate under uniform tensile load. Three components of different material with different obliquity angle were used for analysis. These components having holes circular & oblique at angles 0, 30 and 60 degree are considered for study. The long twisted blades of gas turbine blade will be treated as infinite plate with oblique holes/cooling holes constituting a geometrically complex, three- dimensional body that is subjected to the action of systems centrifugal force. Stress concentration and stress field around oblique holes is a major challenge area in design of aerofoil in aerospace applications for safety because of their highly specialized applications in aerospace field under severe operating conditions. In design, Stress Concentration Factor (SCF) {{can be used as}} multiplication factor, and using that maximum stress can be predicted, thus it shows the stress field around local region. The experimental methods used are photo elastic and strain gauge techniques. When a infinite plate containing a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>oblique</b> hole is subjected to remotely applied uniform tensile load, the circumferential stresses along the boundary of the hole are produced which have been successfully used to predict stresses around holes. The resulting Stress Concentration Factor (SCF) obtained by Finite Element (FE) analysis are compared with experimentally obtained values. The results of FEA technique are in good agreement with experimental values, thus providing a means of analysing more effectively realistic Gas turbine blades. For analysis FEA software MSC/PATRAN, MSC/ NASTRAN-NX v 7. 0 has been used...|$|R
