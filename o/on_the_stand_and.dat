25|$|Iraqi {{authorities}} put Saddam {{and seven}} other former Iraqi officials on trial on 19 October 2005, {{four days after}} the 15 October 2005 referendum on the new Iraq constitution. The tribunal specifically charged the defendants with the killing of 148 Shiites from Dujail, in retaliation for the failed assassination attempt of 8 July 1982. Supporters of Saddam protested against the trial in Tikrit. After the charges were read to them, all eight defendants pleaded not guilty. While initially open to the public, the trial was closed to them on 15 March 2006, after Saddam began making political statements <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> <b>and</b> an argument began between him and the presiding judge.|$|E

It was very brief: she knew nothing of the matter except that the likeness of herself was her property, and had, she thought, been left on the parlor table when she had retired {{on the night of}} the arrest.

He righted himself almost at once, however, and came on. Then they reached the water jump. There was a sudden silence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> <b>and</b> the hillside. Somerfield took off first, the Prince lying well away from him. Both cleared it, but whereas Lady Grace's mare jumped wide and clear, and her rider never even faltered in his saddle, Somerfield lost all his lead and only just kept his seat. They were on the homeward way now, with only one more jump, a double set of hurdles. Suddenly, in the flat, the Prince seemed to stagger in his saddle. Lady Grace cried out.|$|E
