5|$|It is {{generally}} {{believed that the}} propaganda of the Goan priests and the alliance of the Christians with the English cause Tipu to banish the community from Canara.

40|$|On {{the base}} of the solar {{magnetic}} field measurements obtained in Stanford in 1976 [...] 2003 the properties of the cyclic evolution <b>of</b> the <b>large-scale</b> magnetic field are investigated. Some regularities are found in longitudinal and latitudinal evolution of the magnetic field in cycles 21, 22 and 23. The cyclic development <b>of</b> the <b>large-scale</b> magnetic field can be divided into two main phases. The phase I, which includes a period approximately from two years before and until three years after the maximum of the solar cycle, is studied in detail. It is found that before the reversal <b>of</b> the <b>large-scale</b> magnetic field the neutral line of the magnetic field in antipodal longitudinal intervals shifts from the equator to opposite directions in cycles 21 and 22, but not in cycle 23. During the sign reversal <b>of</b> the <b>large-scale</b> magnetic field in cycles 21 and 22 in the antipodal longitudinal intervals the magnetic field of opposite polarity is observed in all latitudes, thereby forming an equatorial dipole. After the magnetic field reversal a longitudinal oscillation of the magnetic neutral line with regard to the equator takes place, which has a period about 2 years and damps to the minimum of the 11 -year cycle. The intervening longitudinal intervals <b>of</b> the <b>large-scale</b> magnetic field correspond to positions of the active longitudes of sunspot activity, thus indicating a close connection <b>of</b> the <b>large-scale</b> and the local magnetic fields. In evolution <b>of</b> the <b>large-scale</b> magnetic field a periodicity with period 1. 23 ± 0. 16 year is revealed, which is close to the period found by helioseismological methods in variations of the solar rotation near the tachocline.

5|$|Evidence <b>of</b> <b>large-scale</b> Mesolithic nut processing, {{radiocarbon}} {{dated to}} circa 7000BC, {{has been found}} in a midden pit at Staosnaig on Colonsay. The dig discovered the remains {{of hundreds of thousands of}} burned hazelnut shells and gives an insight into communal activity and forward planning in the period. The nuts were harvested in a single year and pollen analysis suggests that the hazel trees were all cut down at the same time. The scale of the activity, unparalleled elsewhere in Scotland, and the lack of large game on the island, suggests the possibility that Colonsay contained a community with a largely vegetarian diet for the time they spent on the island.|$|E

As debate about the future employment of Australian forces in the Pacific continued, the future of the unit was in doubt and there was consideration given to it being disbanded.
