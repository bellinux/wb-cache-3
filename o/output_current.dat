25|$|Later {{versions}} of this amplifier schematic may show a somewhat different method of <b>output</b> <b>current</b> limiting.|$|E
25|$|Limited output current: The <b>output</b> <b>current</b> must be finite. In practice, most op-amps are {{designed}} to limit the <b>output</b> <b>current</b> {{so as not to}} exceed a specified level – around 25mA for a type 741 IC op-amp – thus protecting the op-amp and associated circuitry from damage. Modern designs are electronically more rugged than earlier implementations and some can sustain direct short circuits on their outputs without damage.|$|E
25|$|Output {{amplifier}} (outlined cyan and green) — provides {{high current}} gain (low output impedance), along with <b>output</b> <b>current</b> limiting, and output short-circuit protection.|$|E
30|$|However, {{when the}} {{improved}} VSynC with Target 1 is employed, the negative-sequence currents are fully eliminated and the balanced <b>output</b> <b>currents</b> are obtained as Fig.  14 b with {{the positive and}} negative-sequence power references as (9). The active and reactive power oscillations are obviously reduced but still existing. It is effective to avoid the trip-off and damage of VSC aroused by too large <b>output</b> <b>currents.</b> Moreover with Target 2 and 3 as Fig.  14 c and d, the active and reactive power ripples are eliminated, respectively. And the unbalance of <b>output</b> <b>currents</b> is reduced in spite that the negative -sequence currents are still existing.|$|R
40|$|A new current-mode {{sinusoidal}} oscillator circuit {{is presented}} {{of which the}} frequency and phase are single-element controlled. The circuit has two <b>output</b> <b>currents.</b> The frequency of oscillation is controlled by using a grounded resistor without disturbing the condition of oscillation. The phase {{difference between the two}} <b>output</b> <b>currents</b> can be controlled using a grounded passive element (resistor or capacitor or inductor) without disturbing the frequency of oscillation. The theoretical results are confirmed using SPICE simulation...|$|R
25|$|It {{can provide}} very high <b>output</b> <b>{{currents}},</b> since large currents {{can be controlled}} by very small ones, again due to avalanche multiplication.|$|R
25|$|Rectifiers supply polarised voltage for welding. In such {{circuits}} {{control of}} the <b>output</b> <b>current</b> is required; this is sometimes achieved by replacing some of the diodes in a bridge rectifier with thyristors, effectively diodes whose voltage output can be regulated by switching on and off with phase fired controllers.|$|E
25|$|In {{the present}} circuit, if the input {{voltages}} {{change in the}} same direction, the negative feedback makes Q3/Q4 base voltage follow (with 2VBE below) the input voltage variations. Now the output part (Q10) of Q10-Q11 current mirror keeps up the common current through Q9/Q8 constant in spite of varying voltage. Q3/Q4 collector currents, and accordingly the <b>output</b> <b>current</b> {{at the base of}} Q15, remain unchanged.|$|E
25|$|The {{impedance}} seen by {{the load}} needs further discussion. The load in Figure 5 {{is connected to the}} collector of the output transistor, and therefore is separated from the body of the amplifier by the infinite impedance of the <b>output</b> <b>current</b> source. Therefore, feedback has no effect on the output impedance, which remains simply RC2 as {{seen by the}} load resistor RL in Figure 3. AOL) requires care, particularly for the case of output impedance using series feedback. See Jaeger, note below.|$|E
40|$|A {{universal}} active biquad {{using the}} four-terminal floating nullors (FTFNs) is presented. The proposed circuit uses two FTFNs, two capacitors and two resistors. The proposed circuit has two input currents and can provide two highimpedance <b>output</b> <b>currents.</b> Without changing the circuit topology, the <b>output</b> <b>currents</b> can realize lowpass, highpass, bandpass, and allpass transfer functions. A notch transfer function {{can be obtained}} by adding a voltage-to-current converter using an additional FTFN. The proposed circuit enjoys low passive sensitivities and orthogonal tuning of the parameters omegao and omegao/Qo...|$|R
50|$|In {{power systems}} {{it is often}} desired to {{eliminate}} harmonic content found in line currents. VSIs {{can be used as}} active power filters to provide this compensation. Based on measured line currents and voltages, a control system determines reference current signals for each phase. This is fed back through an outer loop and subtracted from actual current signals to create current signals for an inner loop to the inverter. These signals then cause the inverter to generate <b>output</b> <b>currents</b> that compensate for the harmonic content. This configuration requires no real power consumption, as it is fully fed by the line; the DC link is simply a capacitor that is kept at a constant voltage by the control system. In this configuration, <b>output</b> <b>currents</b> are in phase with line voltages to produce a unity power factor. Conversely, VAR compensation is possible in a similar configuration where <b>output</b> <b>currents</b> lead line voltages to improve the overall power factor.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Generic ladder filters {{with either}} (a) voltage input/voltage <b>output,</b> (b) <b>current</b> input/voltage <b>output,</b> (c) voltage input/current <b>output</b> or (d) <b>current</b> input/ <b>current</b> <b>output.</b> The output {{may also be}} the voltage across or the current through an {{internal}} component of the last element.|$|R
25|$|Electrically, RO is a {{resistance}} {{controlled by the}} current flowing through the light source. In the dark state, the resistance typically exceeds a few MOhm; when illuminated, it decreases as the inverse of the light intensity. In contrast to the photodiode and phototransistor, the photoresistor can operate in both the AC and DC circuits and have a voltage of several hundred volts across it. The harmonic distortions of the <b>output</b> <b>current</b> by the RO are typically within 0.1% at voltages below 0.5 V.|$|E
25|$|Note: Tabulated {{formulas}} in Table 3 {{make the}} g-equivalent circuit of the transistor from Figure8 agree with its small-signal low-frequency hybrid-pi model in Figure9. Notation: r = base resistance of transistor, rO = output resistance, and gm = transconductance. The negative sign for g12 reflects the convention that I1, I2 are positive when directed into the two-port. A non-zero value for g12 means the <b>output</b> <b>current</b> affects the input current, that is, this amplifier is bilateral. If g12 = 0, the amplifier is unilateral.|$|E
25|$|These are {{extremely}} light-sensitive vacuum tubes with a photocathode coated onto part (an end or side) {{of the inside}} of the envelope. The photocathode contains combinations of materials such as caesium, rubidium and antimony specially selected to provide a low work function, so when illuminated even by very low levels of light, the photocathode readily releases electrons. By means of a series of electrodes (dynodes) at ever-higher potentials, these electrons are accelerated and substantially increased in number through secondary emission to provide a readily detectable <b>output</b> <b>current.</b> Photomultipliers are still commonly used wherever low levels of light must be detected.|$|E
25|$|Absolute maximum {{ratings are}} defined for {{regulator}} components, specifying the continuous and peak <b>output</b> <b>currents</b> {{that may be}} used (sometimes internally limited), the maximum input voltage, maximum power dissipation at a given temperature, etc.|$|R
5000|$|Z-parameters {{are also}} known as {{open-circuit}} impedance parameters as they are calculated under [...] conditions. i.e., Ix=0, where x=1,2 refer to input and <b>output</b> <b>currents</b> flowing through the ports (of a two-port network in this case) respectively.|$|R
5000|$|Among other {{important}} {{characteristics of a}} linear regulator is the quiescent current, also known as ground current or supply current, which accounts for the difference, although small, between the input and <b>output</b> <b>currents</b> of the LDO, that is: ...|$|R
500|$|The {{behaviour}} of many {{electronic components}} {{can be described}} using matrices. Let A be a 2-dimensional vector with the component's input voltage v1 and input current i1 as its elements, and let B be a 2-dimensional vector with the component's output voltage v2 and <b>output</b> <b>current</b> i2 as its elements. Then the behaviour of the electronic component can be described by [...] B = H · A, where H is a 2 x 2 matrix containing one impedance element (h12), one admittance element (h21) and two dimensionless elements (h11 and h22). Calculating a circuit now reduces to multiplying matrices.|$|E
2500|$|Excellent {{linearity}} of <b>output</b> <b>current</b> as {{a function}} of incident light ...|$|E
2500|$|Transistor Q16 (outlined in green) {{provides}} the quiescent current for the output transistors, and Q17 provides <b>output</b> <b>current</b> limiting.|$|E
50|$|Motor-generators {{have even}} been used where the input and <b>output</b> <b>currents</b> are {{essentially}} the same. In this case, the mechanical inertia of the M-G set is used to filter out transients in the input power. The <b>output's</b> electric <b>current</b> can be very clean (noise free) and {{will be able to}} ride-through brief blackouts and switching transients at the input to the M-G set. This may enable, for example, the flawless cut-over from mains power to AC power provided by a diesel generator set.|$|R
40|$|A Doherty {{amplifier}} {{that combines}} four transistors is proposed. Two transistors are operated in class-B and are interleaved with another two operated in class-C. The interleaved transistors {{are driven by}} a travelling-wave feed and their <b>output</b> <b>currents</b> are combined using a single distributed power combiner...|$|R
5000|$|... 3020 High {{impedance}} (off-state) low-level <b>output</b> leakage <b>current</b> ...|$|R
2500|$|The <b>output</b> <b>current</b> upon {{contact with}} the target will depend on {{various factors such as}} target's resistance, skin type, moisture, bodily salinity, clothing, the {{electroshock}} weapon's internal circuitry, discharge waveform, and battery conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Limited {{dissipated}} power: The <b>output</b> <b>current</b> {{flows through}} the op-amp's internal output impedance, dissipating heat. [...] If the op-amp dissipates too much power, then its temperature will increase above some safe limit. The op-amp may enter thermal shutdown, {{or it may be}} destroyed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{negative}} sign of [...] arises to {{make the}} <b>output</b> <b>current</b> of one cascaded stage (as it appears in the matrix) equal to the input current of the next. [...] Without the minus sign the two currents would have opposite senses because the positive direction of current, by convention, is taken as the current entering the port. [...] Consequently, the input voltage/current matrix vector can be directly replaced with the matrix equation of the preceding cascaded stage to form a combined [...] matrix.|$|E
5000|$|... 3021 High {{impedance}} (off-state) high-level <b>output</b> leakage <b>current</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|In some {{applications}} of a current mirror, particularly for biasing and active load applications, it is advantageous to produce multiple current sources {{from a single}} input reference current. This is not possible in the Wilson configuration while maintaining an accurate match of the input <b>current</b> to the <b>output</b> <b>currents.</b>|$|R
25|$|Output sink current: The <b>output</b> sink <b>current</b> is {{the maximum}} current allowed {{to sink into}} the output stage. Some {{manufacturers}} show the output voltage vs. the <b>output</b> sink <b>current</b> plot, which gives {{an idea of the}} output voltage when it is sinking current from another source into the output pin.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{for the current}} amplifier, the <b>output</b> <b>current</b> βIout of the {{feedback}} network is applied in parallel and with an opposite direction to the input current Ix. As a result, the total current flowing through the circuit input (not only through the input resistance Rin) increases and the voltage across it decreases so that the circuit input resistance decreases (Rin apparently decreases). Its new value can be calculated by applying the dual Miller theorem (for currents) or the basic Kirchhoff's laws: ...|$|E
2500|$|Linacs {{are also}} capable of prodigious output, {{producing}} a nearly continuous stream of particles, whereas a synchrotron will only periodically raise the particles to sufficient energy to merit a [...] "shot" [...] at the target. (The burst {{can be held}} or stored in the ring at energy to give the experimental electronics time to work, but the average <b>output</b> <b>current</b> is still limited.) The high density of the output makes the linac particularly attractive for use in loading storage ring facilities with particles in preparation for particle to particle collisions. The high mass output also makes the device practical {{for the production of}} antimatter particles, which are generally difficult to obtain, being {{only a small fraction of}} a target's collision products. These may then be stored and further used to study matter-antimatter annihilation.|$|E
2500|$|The tuning of the {{synaptic}} projections between {{speech sound}} map and motor map (i.e. tuning of forward motor commands) is accomplished {{with the aid}} of feedback commands, since the projections between sensory error maps and motor map were already tuned during babbling training (see above). Thus the DIVA model tries to [...] "imitate" [...] an auditory speech item by attempting to find a proper feedforward motor command. Subsequently the model compares the resulting sensory <b>output</b> (<b>current</b> sensory state following the articulation of that attempt) with the already learned auditory target region (intended sensory state) for that speech item. Then the model updates the current feedforward motor command by the current feedback motor command generated from the auditory error map of the auditory feedback system. This process may be repeated several times (several attempts). The DIVA model is capable of producing the speech item with a decreasing auditory difference between current and intended auditory state from attempt to attempt.|$|E

40|$|A new photo-stimulated triboelectric {{generation}} occurring {{between a}} metal-oxide and polyimide during friction was demonstrated. The <b>output</b> <b>currents</b> of the triboelectric nanogenerator were significantly enhanced, under light illumination, up to approximately 5 times {{depending on the}} wavelength of the light, providing a new route for energy harvesting devices as well as self-powered selective photodetectors...|$|R
2500|$|Saturation:Output voltage {{is limited}} to a minimum and maximum value close to the power supply voltages. The output of older op-amps can reach to within one or two volts of the supply rails. The output of newer {{so-called}} [...] "rail to rail" [...] op-amps can reach to within millivolts of the supply rails when providing low <b>output</b> <b>currents.</b>|$|R
