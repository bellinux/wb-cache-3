25|$|<b>Online</b> <b>advertisement</b> through banners {{along the}} top or side of a website {{has been the most}} {{prevalent}} form of livelihood for webcomics. In 2005, the creators of Megatokyo, Goats, and Sexy Losers found that they could charge between $1 and $2 USD per 1,000 pageviews. Advertising prices have risen and fallen with the Web's perceived value. With Ad blocking software becoming more prevalent, advertising revenue may drastically decline.|$|E
25|$|Creators of webcomics {{are able}} to do so professionally through various revenue channels. Webcomic artist may sell {{merchandise}} based on their work, such as T-shirts and toys, or they may sell print versions or compilations of their webcomic. Many webcomic creators make use of <b>online</b> <b>advertisement</b> on their websites, and some have undergone product placement deals with larger companies.

40|$|Abstract The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to classify the types of information in online advertising that Internet users prefer and to examine whether different forms of <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> cause disturbance in information searching prior to product purchases. The data were gathered by conducting surveys to college students in three universities in Taipei, Taichung, and Kaohsiung in Taiwan. The total valid samples were 283, out of 300 surveyed respondents. The mobile phone is used in this study as objects due to the familiarities of the products to college students and abundance of information provided online. The informativeness of <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> including dimensions of price/promotion, service, design, and function are what respondents intend to view. Due to the characteristics of the Internet, advertisers are able to utilize animated, colored, and interactive advertisements on Websites to draw attention of users. The concern is that certain advertisements disturb what users are currently doing online. This study intends to examine the reactions to different forms of <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> and to reveal whether respondents express feelings of annoyance for certain forms of <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> during information searching activities. Subsequent behavior of the respondents after verifying whether they are annoyed upon viewing certain types of <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> is examined. Respondents are categorized into two clusters, ad-neutral and ad-annoyed, using variables measuring annoyance of <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> while searching information of mobile phones. For respondents in the ad-neutral cluster, price/promotion and service are factors valued more importantly while viewing information in <b>online</b> <b>advertisements.</b> On the contrary, for respondents in the ad-annoyed cluster, design and function are more important factors than price/promotion and service in terms of information upon seeing <b>online</b> <b>advertisements.</b> Nearly all kinds of <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> cause annoyance to a certain level. For those young adults who do not have reactions of being disturbed by <b>online</b> <b>advertisements,</b> they tend to have subsequent behavior of ignoring the <b>online</b> <b>advertisements.</b> These results indicate Internet users are aware of <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> and understand the disturbance caused by <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> is unavoidable. In sum, if marketers or advertisers intend to design <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> that do not cause too much annoyance to the majority of Internet users, the banners or interstitials should be ideal. Certain types of <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> like pop-ups and mouse-tailing need to be used with caution. When Internet users are disturbed and the annoyance can be tolerated, the information searching behavior goes on. When Internet users are disturbed and the annoyance cannot be tolerated, the information searching behavior is terminated. The effort of designing <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> ended up with users' ignorance or termination can be wasted and useless. Marketers and advertisers not only try to attract attentions of <b>online</b> users with <b>advertisements,</b> but also need to restrict the annoyance or disturbance of <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> to an acceptable level to reduce the opportunities of being ignored or terminated.

500|$|HBO {{reportedly}} {{invested in}} Carnivàle promotion {{as much as}} for any of its primetime series launches. The series' unconventional and complex narrative made the network deviate from its traditional marketing strategies. Teaser trailers were inserted on CD-ROMs into Entertainment Weekly issues {{to draw attention to}} the show's visual quality. 30-second TV spots were aired in national syndication, cable and local avails for four weeks before the show's premiere instead of the usual seven days. The historical context of Carnivàle was deliberately emphasized in the show's print art, which depicted the 17-member cast surrounding a carnival truck. This image was accompanied by a tagline of the show's good versus evil theme: [...] "Into each generation is born a creature of light and a creature of darkness." [...] These measures were hoped to be backed up by positive critical reviews. To give ratings an initial boost, HBO placed the premiere of Carnivàle directly after the series finale of the successful Sex and the City. The series continued to receive extensive <b>online</b> <b>advertisement</b> for almost its entire run.|$|E

In response to Wheeler's video, the kidnappers make another vlog and cut off Holden's ear on-camera to prove they are serious. Although the ear is mailed to forensics and proven to be real, police quickly discover that Willow and Holden placed an <b>online</b> <b>advertisement</b> seeking actors to play kidnapper roles; they soon identify actor Reggie Luckman (Pedro Pascal) {{as one of the}} kidnappers in the WeepingWillow17 videos. Yet another vlog is released, this time with Holden escaping his bonds and shooting one of the kidnappers, before being shot himself by Reggie. Police come to the scene and find Holden alive, along with the dead body of one of the supposed kidnappers named Todd (Trevor Oswalt). Holden insisted the on-camera shooting was fake, and that Reggie shot Todd over a dispute over money after the video was filmed. Holden says the kidnapping videos started as a hoax, but that Reggie has now actually kidnapped Willow.|$|E

In contrast to traditional advertising, <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> establish an interactive communication. Now-a-days, teenagers are frequently using the internet either for educational purposes or at least for entertainment.

Hence, the present study analyses the overall attitude of teenagers about <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> based on gender, educational qualifications and age. To capture the responses from the teenagers being respondents of the study, a well-structured questionnaire was administered to 2500 respondents with a yielding rate of 80. 04 % (2001 usable Questionnaires). The various factors such as general perception, advertising utility, indignity, price perceptions and regulation were captured on a five point scale and further classified into three groups namely favorable, neutral and unfavorable based on the total score. The geographical area of Tamil Nadu State in India was used as the sampling area. The questionnaire was administered in person to students in identified schools and colleges all over Tamil Nadu.
