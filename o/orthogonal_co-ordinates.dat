In shell cases, several mathematical layers must be introduced to approximate the curvature terms and to obtain differential equations with constant coefficients. The present work investigates the convergence of the proposed method related to the order N used for the expansion of the exponential matrix and to the number of mathematical layers M used for the solution of shell equations.

40|$|A {{non-linear}} shell {{theory that}} includes transverse shear strains and its implementation {{in the material}} point method framework are discussed. The applicability of the shell implementation to model large deformations of thin shells is explored. Results suggest that an implicit time stepping scheme may be required for improved modeling of thin shells by the material point method. 1 Shell Formulation The continuum-based approach to shell theory has been chosen because of the relative ease of implementation of constitutive models in this approach compared to exact geometrical descriptions of the shell. In order to include transverse shear strains in the shell, a modified Reissner-Mindlin assumption is used. The major assumptions of the shell formulation are [1, 2] 1. The normal to the mid-surface of the shell remains straight but not necessarily normal. The direction of the initial normal is called the “fiber ” direction {{and it is the}} evolution of the fiber that is tracked. 2. The stress normal to the mid-surface vanishes (plane stress) 3. The momentum due to the extension of the fiber and the momentum balance {{in the direction of the}} fiber are neglected. 4. The curvature of the shell at a material point is neglected. The shell formulation is based on a plate formulation by Lewis et al. [2]. A discussion of the formulation follows. The velocity field in the shell is given by w(α,β) = u(α,β) + z ω(α,β) × n(α,β) + ˙z n(α,β) (1) where w is the velocity of a point in the shell, u is the velocity of the center of mass of the shell, n is the normal or director vector, ω is the angular velocity of the director, (α,β) are <b>orthogonal</b> <b>co-ordinates</b> on the mid-surface of the shell, z is the perpendicular distance from the mid-surface of the shell, and ˙z is the rate of change of the length of the shell director...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe paper {{presents}} a semi analytical method for solution of a statically indeterminate non-uniform bar problem. The solution of such statically indeterminate bar problem becomes more complicated {{due to the}} presence of singularity points in domain. Some examples of such one dimensional problems include, (i) stress and deformation analysis of a clamped–clamped (C–C) bar subjected to a concentrated load within domain, (ii) thermal stress analysis of a ‘C–C’ bar with a point heat source within domain, (iii) three point bending analysis of a roller supported curved beam under a concentrated transverse load, etc. In the present bar problem, only one such singularity point arising from the application of a concentrated axial load, is considered. Governing equation of the problem is derived from equilibrium condition and expressed in variational form with assumed displacement field by using direct variational principle. The computational domain is divided into two sub-domains based on the location of singularity point within the domain. An approximate solution of the governing equation is obtained assuming a series expression of the unknown variable by using Galerkin's principle. This approximation is carried out by a linear combination of sets of <b>orthogonal</b> <b>co-ordinate</b> functions which satisfy prescribed conditions at three points. The three conditions comprises of two boundary conditions and another condition at the point of application of concentrated load.

As known penetrable surfaces {{in some cases}} can be described with Leontovich impedance boundary condition. Here we examine creeping and whispering gallery waves running along curvilinear interfaces in electromagnetic media. We discover that if the contrast of parameters in the two media is su ciently large, then waves of creeping and of whispering gallery types are possible. Both can be simulated by an impedance boundary condition. If the contrast is small, then waves appear of mixed type. Such waves do not satisfy to an impedance boundary condition, their attenuation parameters are subject to a more complicated dispersion equation [1]. We examine the excitation of interface waves both for large and for small contrast.

40|$|Accurate and {{efficient}} numerical solutions {{have been described}} for a selection of financial options pricing problems. The methods are based on finite difference discretisation coupled with optimal solvers of the resulting discrete systems. Regular Cartesian meshes have been combined with <b>orthogonal</b> <b>co-ordinate</b> transformations chosen for numerical accuracy rather than reduction of the differential operator to constant coefficient form. They allow detailed resolution in the regions of interest where accuracy is most desired, and grid coarsening where there is least interest. These transformations are shown {{to be effective in}} producing accurate solutions on modest computational grids. The spatial discretisation strategy is chosen to meet accuracy requirements as sell as to produce coefficient matrices with favourable sparsity and stability properties. In the case of single factor European options, a modified Crank-Nicolson, second order accurate finite difference scheme is presented, which uses adaptive upwind differences when the mesh Peclet conditions are violated. The resulting tridiagonal system of equations is solved using a direct solver. A careful study of grid refinement displays convergence towards the true solution and demonstrates a high level of accuracy can be obtained with this approach. Laplace inversion methods are also implemented as an alternative solution approach for the one-factor European option. Results are compared to those produced by the direct solver algorithm and are shown to be favourable. It is shown how Semi-Lagrange time-integration can solve the path-dependent Asian pricing problem, by integrating out the average price term and simplifying the finite difference equations into a parameterised Black-Scholes form. The implicit equations that result are unconditionally stable, second order accurate and can be solved using standard tridiagonal solvers. The Semi-Lagrange method is shown to be easily used in conjunction with co-ordinate transformations applied in both spatial directions. A variable time-stepping scheme is implemented in the algorithm. Early exercise is also easily incorporated, the resulting linear complementarity problem can be solved using a projection or penalty method (the penalty method is shown to be slightly more efficient). Second order accuracy has been confirmed for Asian options that must be held to maturity. A comparison with published results for continuous-average-rate put and call options, with and without early exercise, shows that the method achieves basis point accuracy and that Richardson extrapolation can also be applied.

The full non-linear Navier-Stokes equations are written in cylindrical co-ordinates with {{the advantage of the}} co-ordinate system fitting the estuary 2 ̆ 7 s shape. Thus the bending of the coastline can be more accurately described. Also, this way a fine mesh is obtained in the coastal area, while a coarse mesh is defined away from the coast provided that the position of the pole is appropriately chosen. The new model aims at improving the resolution of study areas and getting results without increasing computational costs. Validation of the cylindrical co-ordinates numerical model is done by comparison with robust industry-standard models, tidal basin measurements and analytical solution. Three test cases are proposed for comparison with other numerical models: horizontal bed with constant value of the scale factors in the radial direction, horizontal bed with one variation of the scale factors in the radial direction, horizontal bed with two variations of the scale factors in the radial direction. Variation of the scale factors in the radial direction is done with an exponential function. Comparisons with results of the two numerical models show very good agreement. Comparison with tidal basin data is done in three cases: cylindrical co-ordinates (the rectangular geometry is generated from cylindrical co-ordinates), uniform Cartesian co-ordinates, and non-uniform Cartesian co-ordinates.

By treatment of [MOL,(OR) ] solutions with HX (X = halide), further reduction to lower-oxidation-state species occurs when M = Tc, while another class of stable and neutral oxo complexes, termed 'twisted', is produced when M = Re. Two mutually <b>orthogonal</b> L- chelates <b>co-ordinate</b> the metal while still preserving the cis-phosphorus configuration, one ligand bridging an equatorial and an apical position (with the phosphinoamido nitrogen trans to the Re-O linkage) and the other two equatorial positions. The equatorial plane is completed by a halide atom. The chloro derivative [ReOL 2 Cl] exhibits two crystalline forms, alpha (12) and beta (13), the crystal structures of which have been determined: 12, monoclinic, space group P 2 (1) /n, Z = 4, a = 9. 594 (l), b = 18. 565 (4), c = 17. 656 (2) angstrom, beta = 91. 00 (1) -degrees, R' 0. 0477 using 2979 observed reflections; Re- 0 1. 767 (7), Re-Cl 2. 436 (3), Re-P(1) 2. 429 (3), Re-P(2) 2. 479 (3), Re-N(1) 1. 986 (9), Re-N(2) 2. 029 (8) angstrom; O-Re-N(2) 162. 8 (3), O-Re-N(l) 108. 6 (3) -degrees; 13, orthorhombic, space group P 2 (1) 2 (1) 2 (1), Z = 4, a = 10. 196 (5), b = 14. 047 (6), c = 21. 987 (8) angstrom, R' 0. 0671 using 2501 observed reflections; Re- 0 1. 69 (l), Re-Cl 2. 422 (6), Re-P(1) 2. 434 (5), Re-P(2) 2. 476 (5), Re-N(l) 2. 01 (l), Re-N(2) 2. 04 (1) angstrom; O-Re-N(2) 162. 7 (6), O-Re-N(l) 109. 0 (7) -degrees. The interconversion between 'equatorial' and 'twisted' species is discussed. Elemental analyses, FAB mass, IR, electronic, H- 1 and P- 31 NMR spectra are reported. The P- 31 NMR signal is diagnostic for both classes of complexes in solution, being a singlet for the 'equatorial' and two doublets for the 'twisted' species, respectively...|$|R
