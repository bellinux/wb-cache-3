5|$|In 1980, an Italian {{promoter}} {{encouraged the}} original Pentangle to reform {{for a tour}} and a new album. The reunion started badly, with Terry Cox being injured in a car accident, resulting in the band's debuting at the Cambridge Folk Festival as a four-piece Pentangle. They managed to complete a tour of Italy (with Cox in a wheelchair) and Australia, before Renbourn left the band in 1983. There then followed a series of personnel changes, including Mike Piggott replacing John Renbourn from 1983 to 1987 and recording <b>Open</b> <b>the</b> <b>Door</b> <b>and</b> In the Round, but ultimately leaving Jansch and McShee as the only original members. The final incarnation consisting of Jansch, McShee, Nigel Portman Smith (keyboards), Peter Kirtley (guitar and vocals) and Gerry Conway (drums) survived from 1987 to 1995 and recorded three albums: Think of Tomorrow, One More Road and Live 1994. As a solo artist in the mid-1980s, he often appeared on Vivian Stanshall and Ki Longfellow-Stanshall's showboat, the Old Profanity Showboat, in Bristol's Floating Harbour.|$|E

Around that time she started working on her first novel <b>Open</b> <b>the</b> <b>Door!</b> <b>and</b> became engaged to Donald Carswell, an old acquaintance from Glasgow University and the Glasgow Herald, whom she married early in 1915. Their son John {{was born in the}} following autumn.|$|E
25|$|Hearing her screams {{from behind}} the door, Teresa (Jenna Dewan Tatum) is spotted by Bloody Face who kicks <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> attacks her. Grabbing her, Bloody Face then throws Teresa against a wall, {{knocking}} her unconscious. Bloody Face prepares to kill Teresa when Leo (Adam Levine), {{in an attempt to}} save her life, throws himself into Bloody Face's way, knocking both of them onto the floor and Bloody Face unconscious. While Teresa regains consciousness, Leo kicks the murder weapon away from Bloody Face towards Teresa. Grabbing the weapon, Teresa violently stabs Bloody Face. They attempt to run down the hall to escape and another Bloody Face on the other end stops them. In disbelief, they turn around to see a third Bloody Face, who fatally shoots them. The two Bloody Faces removed their masks and discuss the recent events, with one appearing nervous of their crime. One of them notices Leo's arm and questions it just as another Bloody Face approaches them.|$|E

It was incredible, I have never experienced anything like that. It was really reportage, loose, not planned, we went with feeling, we went with instinct... It's a beautiful cycle of energy." ...|$|E
500|$|James Hunt with Den of Geek {{stated that}} [...] " [...] is, quite genuinely, brilliant. Everything that {{went wrong with}} Agents Of SHIELD goes right in Agent Carter. It looks fantastic, doing its level best to {{recreate}} 1940s New York on what is probably quite a low budget, and succeeding. It ties into the MCU in ways that feel natural ...There isn't a weak performance in the cast, and even the writing is strong, with compelling plots giving space to subplots which chug along at a nice pace. And the most surprising part? It's actually funny." [...] He was positive about Atwell's performance, but praised D'Arcy as [...] "the breakout star of the cast". Amy Ratcliffe of Nerdist concluded her review of the episode saying [...] "Overall, Agent Carter didn’t <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> tiptoe in; it busted through and took charge. Atwell is a magnetic force of nature and seems completely {{at home in the}} role, and she’s complemented by D’Arcy and Gjokaj." [...] She also felt that lessons had been learned from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and thought that all the work put into creating the period setting had paid off. Britt Hayes, reviewing for Screen Crush, felt that the episode [...] "fumbles a little, as most series do when they’re introducing us to a new world", but was positive of Atwell, D'Arcy, and the cinematography. Hayes' major issue was the score, which she explained [...] "often lingers a little too long and feels slightly tone deaf—it definitely cheapens the proceedings, and reminds us that this is television, not film." ...|$|E

2500|$|The lyrics for [...] "T.W.L" [...] {{are about}} going forward towards a goal without looking back. The chorus {{emphasizes}} this with, [...] " [...] Ok! Don't say 4... 5.../Just prepare yourself/Rush through that door/What's {{waiting for us}} there (We'll just go anyway)". The song also uses a lot of bilingual word puns and regular Japanese puns to bring double meaning to the song.

2500|$|On {{the other}} side, Anthony Kennedy felt that Prima Paint and {{subsequent}} decisions had [...] "certainly displaced {{the states and}} state law from this area [...] a very substantial extent". It {{was up to the}} Court to resolve confusion similar to that created in the instant case, he added. Antonin Scalia worried that ruling in Cardegna's favor would open the floodgates of litigation. [...] "All {{you have to do is}} <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> you will have litigation in court," [...] Ginsburg agreed, [...] "and then the court will decide what the arbitrator would otherwise decide." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cantrell is a {{recovering}} addict and alcoholic {{and has been}} sober since 2003. He was awarded the 2012 Stevie Ray Vaughan Award from MusiCares, for his work helping other addicts with the recovery process. Cantrell said in his acceptance speech, [...] "I crash landed here almost 9 years ago, in Los Angeles. Sean [...] was {{at the door with}} my brother, so my choices were <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> go to rehab or jump out the back window down a cliff into some black berry bushes. That’s the choice I took. Luckily they caught me because I couldn’t go anywhere, I was kind of stuck in a bush {{at the bottom of a}} cliff bleeding, and I ended up here. I didn’t intend to get here but I’m very grateful I am here, and it took a lot of people to help me get here. It's been an amazing day. It's overwhelming. I'm as imperfect as they come. I just don't get high today and wake up the next morning and try and do the same thing. A lot of people stand and get the fuck back up after falling. Some people don't get that chance. My band's been a harsh example of that – what happens when you don't deal with it." [...] Cantrell and his Alice in Chains bandmates played a five-song set at the awards event and Cantrell stated, [...] "We really miss Layne [...] and Mike , and we carry them with us in our hearts".|$|E
2500|$|Kirsten {{told police}} he went to Cornell’s room at 12:15a.m., but couldn't access the locked room. He then had a {{telephone}} conversation with Vicky Cornell. [...] "I told Vicky that they wouldn’t come <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> {{she told me to}} kick it open. I did. Upon entry, I found the bedroom door locked. I called the hotel operator and told her that I needed security to open the bedroom door. They refused again, and I told them that I’m going to damage the hotel room and (they) need to send security, call 911 and call an ambulance. I kicked the bedroom door 6-7 times before it somehow popped open. I went inside and the bathroom door was partially opened and I could see his feet." [...] Kirsten told police in a signed statement. Kirsten said that Vicky {{was on the phone with}} him the whole time asking for updates, [...] "She told me that she called the front desk and they hung up on her. It was a female. She called back a couple minutes later and a male answered, saying that it was (the first) that he was hearing about the incident." [...] Kirsten said in his statement that he loosened the band around Cornell's neck then tried to resuscitate him by compressing his chest. Medical personnel arrived at 12:56 a.m and tried to resuscitate the singer with no success. Cornell was pronounced dead at 1:30a.m., an hour and 15 minutes after his bodyguard was first contacted by Cornell's wife. It's unknown how long it took the bodyguard to gain entry to the hotel room and find Cornell.|$|E
