5|$|Bristol Rovers {{are known}} for their {{distinctive}} blue and white quartered shirts, which they have worn for most <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>history.</b> The current home kit consists of a light blue and white quartered shirt and white shorts, while the away kit is black and gold with the same colours as the trim. During the 2008–09 season a special third strip, which is black with a gold sash, and is a reproduction of the original Black Arab shirt, was used for a single match to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the club.|$|E
5|$|For the {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>history,</b> Bristol Rovers have played their home {{games at the}} Eastville Stadium, where they remained {{for a period of}} 89 years from 1897–1986. Financial problems led to the team being forced to leave Eastville, and they found a temporary home at Twerton Park, the home of Bath City. They stayed in Bath for 10 seasons, before returning to Bristol in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Macedonism (Македонизъм) is the {{political}} ideology or simply views that the Slavs of Macedonia are an ethnic group separate from Bulgarians, with their own separate language, history and culture. It {{is also used to}} describe what Bulgarians view as the falsification <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>history</b> whether by Macedonian or foreign scholars who subscribe to the Macedonist point of view. It carries strong negative connotations.|$|E

5|$|Since their {{election}} to the Football League in 1894, Leicester have spent much <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>history</b> within the top two tiers of English football. Leicester have played outside the top two tiers only once in their history to date; during the 2008–09 season they played in League One, the third tier of English football, after relegation from the Championship the season prior. However, they made a swift return to the second tier, as they were promoted as champions in the 2008–09 season. The club have never played lower than England's third tier.|$|E

The club has won the League Championship four times, the FA Cup five times, the League Cup three times and the European Cup Winners' Cup once.|$|E

5|$|Widespread {{restoration}} {{work was}} then carried out; at Calshot, Deal, Hurst, Pendennis, Portland, St Catherine's and Southsea, the more modern {{additions to the}} fortifications were destroyed {{in an attempt to}} recreate the appearance of the castles at earlier periods <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>history,</b> ranging from the 16th to the 19th centuries. There was extensive research into the forts during this period, commencing in 1951 with a long-running research project commissioned by the Ministry of Works into the Device Forts, which in turn led to heightened academic interest in their histories during the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} as runners-up in Allsvenskan for {{the final}} {{two years of the}} 1960s, Malmö FF started the most successful decade <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>history</b> with a Swedish Championship in 1970. The club won Allsvenskan in 1970, 1971, 1974, 1975 and 1977 as well as Svenska Cupen in 1976 and 1978. The 1977 Allsvenskan victory qualified the club for the 1978–79 European Cup, and after victories against AS Monaco, Dynamo Kyiv, Wisła Kraków and Austria Wien, they reached the final of the competition, which they played at Olympiastadion in Munich against Nottingham Forest. Trevor Francis, who scored the only goal of the match, won it 1–0 for Forest. Nevertheless, the 1979 European Cup run is the biggest success in the history of Malmö FF. The team were given the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal the same year, awarded for the most significant Swedish sporting achievement of the year, for their achievement in the European Cup.|$|E
5|$|Albion and Wolves have contested the Black Country derby, {{it is one}} of {{the longest}} {{standing}} derbies in world football, being played more than 150 times; their first major clash was an FA Cup tie in 1886. The rivalry came to prominence when the two clubs contested the league title in 1953–54, and during the 1990s it intensified to new heights among supporters, with both clubs languishing in Division One for much of the decade and only local pride at stake. Moreover, in 2002 Albion came from being 11 points adrift to overhaul Wolves to gain promotion. The rivalry was further heightened after the sides met in the play-offs in 2007. A 2004 survey by Planetfootball.com confirmed that the majority of both Albion and Wolves supporters consider the other to be their main rival. Despite their geographical location, fellow Black County club Walsall are seen as lesser rivals, having played in a lower division than Albion for most <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>history.</b>|$|E

5|$|Albion {{had spent}} the {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>history</b> in the top-flight of English football, but when the FA Premier League was founded in 1992 the club found themselves in the third tier, which had been renamed Division Two. In 1992–93, Albion finished fourth and entered {{the playoffs for the}} first time, having just missed out the previous year. Albion's first appearance at Wembley for over 20 years – and their last ever at the original stadium – saw them beat Port Vale 3–0 to return to the second level – now renamed the First Division. Manager Ossie Ardiles then joined Tottenham Hotspur, however, and a succession of managers over the next few seasons saw Albion consolidate their Division One status without ever mounting a serious promotion challenge.|$|E
5|$|Andover's {{traditional}} {{strip of}} red and black stripes was worn {{for the vast majority}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>history.</b> This was changed to red and black quarters in 1950 and remained so until 1957 when the club reverted to the traditional stripes. When promotion to the Southern League was gained in 1972, the team's colours were changed, this time to red with a single white stripe. This kit was worn until 1988, when the familiar red and black stripes were re-introduced. For the 2008–09 season, a plain red kit was introduced to commemorate the club's 125th anniversary—this was worn {{for the first time in}} the pre-season friendly against Salisbury City. The last away kit worn by the team was yellow and black shirts with white shorts. However, various combinations have been worn in recent years, such as white shirts with blue sleeves and blue shorts, and tangerine shirts with white shorts.|$|E
5|$|Battleship {{doctrine}} emphasised {{the concentration}} of the battlegroup. In order for this concentrated force {{to be able to}} bring its power to bear on a reluctant opponent (or to avoid an encounter with a stronger enemy fleet), battlefleets needed some means of locating enemy ships beyond horizon range. This was provided by scouting forces; at various stages battlecruisers, cruisers, destroyers, airships, submarines and aircraft were all used. (With the development of radio, direction finding and traffic analysis would come into play, as well, so even shore stations, broadly speaking, joined the battlegroup.) So for most <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>history,</b> battleships operated surrounded by squadrons of destroyers and cruisers. The North Sea campaign of the First World War illustrates how, despite this support, the threat of mine and torpedo attack, and the failure to integrate or appreciate the capabilities of new techniques, seriously inhibited the operations of the Royal Navy Grand Fleet, the greatest battleship fleet of its time.|$|E

50|$|Having {{no other}} teams {{of a similar}} size in its nearest proximity, FC Groningen lacks {{traditional}} rivals. SC Veendam was the nearest professional team to Groningen until the club dissolved in 2013, but as Groningen and Veendam were in different divisions during most <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>histories,</b> and Veendam had a significantly smaller following, a strong two-sided rivalry never developed.|$|R
5|$|Hibs {{played on}} The Meadows {{for the first}} two years <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>history,</b> before moving to grounds in Newington (Mayfield Park) and Bonnington Road, Leith (Powderhall), in {{different}} spells between 1877 and 1879. After the lease on Mayfield Park expired, Hibs moved to a ground known as Hibernian Park, on what is now Bothwell Street in Leith. Hibs failed to secure the ground lease and a builder started constructing houses on the site in 1890. Hibs obtained a lease on a site that is now known as Easter Road in 1892 and have played their home matches there since February 1893.|$|E

5|$|Monotype's {{development}} of Ehrhardt took {{place under the}} influence of executive and historian of printing Stanley Morison, not long after their successful creation of Times New Roman. It began from a recognition that the Janson designs were well-respected by fine printers of the Arts and Crafts period such as Daniel Berkeley Updike, who could print books from them using hand-set type cast from surviving original matrices owned by the Stempel company of Germany. Morison had discussed what he knew <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>history</b> with Updike in their extensive correspondence from the 1920s onwards. Modernised versions of the Janson designs for hot metal printing were being created by Linotype and Monotype's American branch at the same time. In addition, Morison was interested in the history of printing in Leipzig, a centre of the German book trade, and would later write an article on the topic.|$|E
5|$|Several {{buildings}} were constructed {{on the summit}} during the Saxon and early medieval periods; they have been interpreted as an early church and monks' hermitage. The head of a wheel cross dating from the 10th or 11th century has been recovered. The original wooden church was destroyed by an earthquake in 1275, and the stone Church of St Michael built on the site in the 14th century. Its tower remains, {{although it has been}} restored and partially rebuilt several times. Archaeological excavations during the 20th century sought to clarify the background of the monument and church, but some aspects <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>history</b> remain unexplained. The Tor is mentioned in Celtic mythology, particularly in myths linked to King Arthur, and has a number of other enduring mythological and spiritual associations.|$|E
5|$|Stockport County {{joined the}} Football League in 1900 and competed in it {{continuously}} from 1905 to 2011.

However, instability {{on and off the}} pitch eventually led to Stockport falling back to the lower divisions. The club started the 2011–12 season in the Conference National, having been relegated from Football League Two {{for the first time in}} their history at the end of 2010–11. At the end of 2012–13, Stockport were relegated to the Conference North.|$|E
