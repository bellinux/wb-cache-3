5|$|The English Garden is a {{rectangular}} garden featuring brick paths, a pergola that features cypress {{trees at the}} head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden,</b> {{and a number of}} statues and garden ornaments. The garden has hundreds of native trees, shrubs, and perennials, most notably azaleas. It also features a wall garden, which was built in 1922. The centerpiece <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> is a large wisteria arbor.|$|E
5|$|Behind {{these three}} halls lies the Imperial Garden (M). Relatively small, and compact in design, the garden {{nevertheless}} contains several elaborate landscaping features. To the north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> is the Gate of Divine Might.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the World Monuments Fund began {{a program}} to restore the lead sculptures by British {{sculptor}} John Cheere, {{as well as some}} of the other features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden.</b> The project is ongoing.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> marvel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gardens</b> <b>of</b> Versailles - {{then as now}} - is the fountains.

50|$|<b>The</b> first curator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gardens</b> was Daniel Bunce, who was {{appointed}} in 1857. In 1859 a conservatory and greenhouse were erected in <b>the</b> <b>gardens.</b> John Raddenberry took over <b>the</b> curatorship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gardens</b> in 1872 after <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> Bunce <b>the</b> same year.|$|R
50|$|The {{estate was}} divided into lots in 1949 {{and they were all}} sold, and the house was given its Grade I {{designation}} on 29 May 1957. <b>The</b> house and <b>gardens</b> were sold to Northcliffe School in 1961, and the school demolished parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gardens</b> to make way for several new buildings. <b>The</b> remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gardens</b> were not well cultivated during the school's tenure. The Atherley School took over Northcliffe School in 1995 and built further buildings on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gardens.</b> <b>The</b> school closed in 2006.|$|R
5|$|In 2015, the Royal Horticultural Society {{announced}} plans for a restoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> at Worsley New Hall, to open in 2019 under the name RHS Garden Bridgewater.|$|E
5|$|In literature, Bahrain was {{the site}} of the ancient land of Dilmun {{mentioned}} in the Epic of Gilgamesh. Legend also states that it was the location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Garden</b> of Eden.|$|E
5|$|The nearest {{relatives}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> warbler {{outside the}} sister group {{are believed to}} be the African hill babbler and Dohrn's thrush-babbler, both of which should probably be placed in Sylvia rather than their current genera, Pseudoalcippe and Horizorhinus respectively.|$|E

50|$|Public {{awareness}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gardens</b> {{increased with}} <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Friends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Botanical <b>Gardens</b> in 1989. During the 1990s <b>the</b> educative function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> botanic <b>garden</b> was emphasised. Interpretative services and guided walks were introduced {{and an annual}} Botanical Garden Festival introduced.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Botanic <b>Gardens</b> became in {{due course}} also <b>the</b> Conservator <b>of</b> forests. <b>The</b> <b>gardens</b> stayed under his care until <b>the</b> {{creation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> Agriculture in 1913. The latter then took over <b>the</b> responsibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gardens</b> and they have remained under its control ever since.|$|R
5|$|To {{complement}} the garden, a bath house and summer house were constructed {{at the corners}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> furthest from the castle. The bath house is ruined, but the two-storey summer house survives intact. It comprises a groin-vaulted lower room, with an upper chamber, containing the only surviving example of the castle’s carved-oak wall panelling. Charles McKean attributes the design and construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> buildings to Thomas Leiper, an Aberdeenshire stonemason, based on the elaborately decorated gun holes in the summer house.|$|E
5|$|A snail {{does not}} have a dart to fire the very first time it mates, because the first mating is {{necessary}} to trigger the process of dart formation. Once a snail has mated, it fires a dart before some, but not all, subsequent matings. A snail often mates without having a dart to use, because it takes time to create a replacement dart. In the case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> snail Cornu aspersum, it takes a week for a new dart to form.|$|E
5|$|At Vauxhall, Sir Samuel Morland built a fine room, anno 1667, {{the inside}} all of looking-glass, and fountains very {{pleasant}} to behold, {{which is much}} visited by strangers: it {{stands in the middle}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden,</b> covered with Cornish slate, on the point of which he placed a punchinello, very well carved, which held a dial, but the winds have demolished it.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Dow <b>Gardens</b> {{were started}} in 1899 by Herbert Dow, founder <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Dow Chemical Company, and {{gardener}} Elzie Côte, on eight acres (3.2 ha) of flat, sandy land. The Herbert H. Dow House {{is located at}} <b>the</b> southwest corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gardens.</b> <b>The</b> Alden Dow House and Studio are on <b>the</b> west side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gardens,</b> separated by a pond.

Upon his election to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1971 the Celtics retired his #14 jersey and hung it in the rafters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Garden.</b> Cousy {{was named to the}} NBA 25th Anniversary Team in 1971, the NBA 35th Anniversary Team in 1981, and the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1996, making him one of only four players that were selected to each of those teams. He was also the first president of National Basketball Players Association.|$|E
5|$|Ellen Biddle Shipman {{designed}} the Italian Garden in May 1931. It features {{two rows of}} clipped evergreens between two long, rectangular reflecting pools. It has a focal point at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> {{in the form of}} a marble fountain surrounded by an arched gloriette. There are also a number of statues, ornaments, tubs of small trees, and flowers.|$|E
5|$|Every {{configuration}} of Rule 90 has exactly four predecessors, other configurations {{that form the}} given configuration after a single step. Therefore, in contrast to many other cellular automata such as Conway's Game of Life, Rule 90 has no Garden of Eden, a configuration with no predecessors. It {{provides an example of}} a cellular automaton that is surjective (each configuration has a predecessor) but not injective (it has sets of more than one configuration with the same successor), showing that the converse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Garden</b> of Eden theorem is not true.|$|E

5|$|From there north, it is a rural two-lane {{road that}} runs northeasterly through woodland. The {{trunkline}} turns north along LI Road through farmland, and then east along 16th Road near Puffy Bay. South of Garden, the highway turns north {{through the village}} on State Street. M-183 continues north of town running through the farms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Garden</b> Peninsula along Big Bay de Noc through the Lake Superior State Forest to the northern terminus at US2 in Garden Corners.|$|E
5|$|In 1654, when Michael Roberts was principal, {{the college}} {{accounts}} record payment {{for construction of}} a ball court. This was {{to the west of}} the principal's garden (which is to the north of the lodgings, alongside Ship Street), between a privy, stables, and the wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden.</b> Ball courts, bowling greens and groves were often added within the precincts of colleges during the 17th century so that undergraduates could amuse themselves under the watchful eyes of their tutors, rather than indulge in forbidden pursuits such as drinking in alehouses. In 1757, principal Thomas Pardo added the area of the ball court to the garden of the lodgings and had a coach-house built there, which was reached from an entrance on the corner of Turl Street and Ship Street along a driveway across the north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden.</b>|$|E

5|$|In his History of Animals, Aristotle {{considered}} that the garden warbler eventually metamorphosed into a blackcap. The composer Olivier Messiaen used the song <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> warbler {{as the basis}} for his 1971 solo piano piece La fauvette des jardins, the title being the French name of the species. His Turangalîla-Symphonie, a major work inspired by the legend of Tristan and Iseult, has a summer garden scene as its sixth movement. This features the song of the warbler, along with those of the nightingale and blackbird.|$|E
5|$|In the three-acre garden, when Jane and Kingsley lived there, {{there was}} an old barn that was itself a listed building, a conservatory, a gravel drive, three {{descending}} lawns, a rose garden, cedar trees, a mulberry tree (where Lucy Snowe, their cat, was buried), and a weathervane dating to 1775. At the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden,</b> through a five-bar gate, there lay a five-acre meadow that also belonged to the property and had been let out to two local women for their horses.|$|E
5|$|M-183 is a north–south state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the Upper Peninsula of the US state of Michigan. It serves Fayette State Park as an access route from US Highway 2 (US2).

It has been a state park since the late 1950s, and the connecting road has been a state highway since the 1980s.|$|E
