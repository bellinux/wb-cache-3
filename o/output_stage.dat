25|$|Fuzzy {{controllers}} {{are very}} simple conceptually. They consist of an input stage, a processing stage, and an <b>output</b> <b>stage.</b> The input stage maps sensor or other inputs, such as switches, thumbwheels, and so on, {{to the appropriate}} membership functions and truth values. The processing stage invokes each appropriate rule and generates a result for each, then combines {{the results of the}} rules. Finally, the <b>output</b> <b>stage</b> converts the combined result back into a specific control output value.|$|E
25|$|Low-impedance outputs {{typically}} require high quiescent (i.e., idle) {{current in}} the <b>output</b> <b>stage</b> and will dissipate more power, so low-power designs may purposely sacrifice low output impedance.|$|E
25|$|Output {{sink current}}: The output sink current is the maximum current allowed {{to sink into}} the <b>output</b> <b>stage.</b> Some {{manufacturers}} show the output voltage vs. the output sink current plot, which gives {{an idea of the}} output voltage when it is sinking current from another source into the output pin.|$|E
50|$|RF <b>output</b> <b>stages</b> (RF {{amplifiers}} and filters).|$|R
50|$|Sziklai pairs {{are often}} used in the <b>output</b> <b>stages</b> of power {{amplifiers}} due to their advantages both in linearity and bandwidth when compared with more common Darlington emitter follower <b>output</b> <b>stages.</b> They are especially advantageous in amplifiers where the intended load {{does not require the}} use of parallel devices.|$|R
5000|$|Single-ended <b>output</b> <b>stages</b> have an {{asymmetrical}} transfer function, {{meaning that}} even-order harmonics in the created distortion tend to not cancel out (as {{they do in}} push-pull <b>output</b> <b>stages).</b> For tubes, or FETs, most distortion is second-order harmonics, from the square law transfer characteristic, which to some produces a [...] "warmer" [...] and more pleasant sound.|$|R
25|$|With {{advances}} in power semiconductors, it became possible to output high voltage {{directly from the}} <b>output</b> <b>stage</b> of the amplifier. For example, in 1967, Crown International introduced the DC300 amplifier, which is capable of directly driving 70-volt lines, as well as traditional speaker loads, thanks to its overall power of 500W. In 1987, Crown introduced the Macrotech 2400, capable of driving 100-volt lines directly. Since that time, further developments in high-power amplifier technology have widened the choices; many manufacturers make amplifiers capable of direct connection to a high-impedance constant-voltage speaker line. High-voltage audio amplifiers have almost become a one chip solution. For example, National Semiconductor's LME49810 (and similar products LME49811 and LME49830) can output 100 V peak to peak signals, but have relatively low current output, so a standard circuit includes a Darlington or FET discrete <b>output</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{practical}} {{amplifier circuit}} {{to the right}} could {{be the basis for}} a moderate-power audio amplifier. It features a typical (though substantially simplified) design as found in modern amplifiers, with a class-AB push–pull <b>output</b> <b>stage,</b> and uses some overall negative feedback. Bipolar transistors are shown, but this design would also be realizable with FETs or valves.|$|E
25|$|Amplifiers {{often have}} {{multiple}} stages in cascade to increase gain. Each stage of these designs {{may be a}} different type of amp to suit the needs of that stage. For instance, the first stage might be a class-A stage, feeding a class-AB push–pull second stage, which then drives a class-G final <b>output</b> <b>stage,</b> taking advantage of the strengths of each type, while minimizing their weaknesses.|$|E
50|$|The Emulator II has {{a unique}} sound due to its DPCM mu-255 companding, divider-based {{variable}} sample-rate principle and analog <b>output</b> <b>stages</b> featuring SSM2045 24 dB/oct analogue four-pole low pass resonant filters. Equivalent <b>output</b> <b>stages</b> in modern samplers perform similar functions purely in the digital domain and aficionados of the sound of analogue electronics argue that some of this analogue 'magic' is lost.|$|R
40|$|An {{output device}} for {{optimizing}} propagation delay and minimizing chip area is described. An optimum means of tapering the <b>output</b> <b>stages</b> to minimize propagation delay is determined. The minimum delay {{is a function}} of the capacitive load to node ratio, the number of <b>output</b> <b>stages,</b> and the interstage propagation delay. The effects on area are also presented. A figure of merit which {{is a function of}} area and propagation time is defined which is of use in designing <b>output</b> <b>stages.</b> An optimum exists which can be considered the best compromise between further decreasing propagation delay and increasing chip area. Data are also presented which allow a designer to determine the minimum chip area once the capacitive load and the maximum allowable delay are known...|$|R
50|$|Isolation {{amplifiers}} {{may include}} isolated power supplies {{for both the}} input and <b>output</b> <b>stages,</b> or may use external power supplies on each isolated portion.|$|R
25|$|A {{vertical}} input {{goes to a}} frequency-compensated step attenuator {{to reduce}} large signals to prevent overload. The attenuator feeds a low-level stage (or a few), which in turn feed gain stages (and a delay-line driver {{if there is a}} delay). Following are more gain stages, up to the final <b>output</b> <b>stage</b> which develops a large signal swing (tens of volts, sometimes over 100 volts) for CRT electrostatic deflection.|$|E
25|$|Some of Widlar's designs {{mentioned}} by Swanson and Hodgson, like the LM12 power amplifier and the LM10 ultra-low-voltage amplifier introduced in 1978, remain in {{production in the}} 21st century. LM10 is capable of operating with a 1.1 volt power supply, thus instead of a conventional bandgap reference it employs Widlar's sub-bandgap circuit locked at 200 mV and the low-voltage Widlar <b>output</b> <b>stage.</b> For 10 years, {{no one else in}} the industry was able to produce a circuit that matched the LM10.|$|E
25|$|Following World War II, tubes {{intended}} {{to be used in}} series heater strings were redesigned to all have the same ("controlled") warm-up time. Earlier designs had quite-different thermal time constants. The audio <b>output</b> <b>stage,</b> for instance, had a larger cathode, and warmed up more slowly than lower-powered tubes. The result was that heaters that warmed up faster also temporarily had higher resistance, because of their positive temperature coefficient. This disproportionate resistance caused them to temporarily operate with heater voltages well above their ratings, and shortened their life.|$|E
25|$|Amplitude {{modulated}} (AM) transmitters with optionally–variable frequency, using class-C power <b>output</b> <b>stages</b> with plate modulation, are the workhorses {{of international}} shortwave broadcasting, including numbers stations.|$|R
50|$|The design used triodes as phase {{inverters}} and drivers. The original <b>output</b> <b>stages</b> used triode-connected KT66 tetrodes, {{although a}} 6L6, with slightly lower output, could be used.|$|R
50|$|Most modern power {{amplifiers}} (including {{those used in}} hi-fi) employ both techniques, using both class-AB in their <b>output</b> <b>stages,</b> and feedback, offering reasonable efficiency and good distortion figures.|$|R
25|$|A hybrid {{amplifier}} involves {{one of two}} {{combinations of}} tube and solid-state amplification. It may have a tube power amp fed by a solid-state pre-amp circuit, as {{in most of the}} original MusicMan Amps, later amplifier models from Alamo Electronics, the Fender Super Champ XD, and the Roland Bolt amplifier. Randall Amplifiers V2 and T2 use hybrid amp technology. Alternatively, a tube pre-amp can feed a solid-state <b>output</b> <b>stage,</b> as in models from Kustom, Hartke, SWR and Vox. This approach dispenses with the need for an output transformer and easily achieves modern power levels.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of outputs, {{comparators}} can also be classified as open drain or push–pull. Comparators with an open-drain <b>output</b> <b>stage</b> use an external pull up resistor to a positive supply that defines the logic high level. Open drain comparators {{are more suitable for}} mixed-voltage system design. Since the output is high impedance for logic level high, open drain comparators {{can also be used to}} connect multiple comparators on to a single bus. Push pull output does not need a pull up resistor and can also source current unlike an open drain output.|$|E
25|$|The third-generation iPod had a weak bass response, {{as shown}} in audio tests. The {{combination}} of the undersized DC-blocking capacitors and the typical low impedance of most consumer headphones form a high-pass filter, which attenuates the low-frequency bass output. Similar capacitors {{were used in the}} fourth-generation iPods. The problem is reduced when using high-impedance headphones and is completely masked when driving high-impedance (line level) loads, such as an external headphone amplifier. The first-generation iPod Shuffle uses a dual-transistor <b>output</b> <b>stage,</b> rather than a single capacitor-coupled output, and does not exhibit reduced bass response for any load.|$|E
50|$|Optimal {{quiescent}} current in an amplifier using Sziklai pairs {{also tends to}} be much lower than in Darlington-based <b>output</b> <b>stages,</b> {{on the order of}} 10mA vs. 100mA or more for some emitter follower <b>output</b> <b>stages.</b> This means that idle power consumption is on the order of a few watts versus tens of watts for the same performance in many cases. This is a very compelling reason to use the Sziklai pair in cases where output power is moderate (25-100W), fidelity is critical and relatively low idle power consumption is desired.|$|R
5000|$|There is no valve analog of the {{complementary}} devices {{widely used in}} [...] "totem pole" [...] <b>output</b> <b>stages</b> of silicon circuits. Push-pull valve topologies therefore require a phase splitter.|$|R
50|$|The term {{single-ended}} triode amplifier {{is mainly}} used for <b>output</b> <b>stages</b> of audio power amplifiers.The phrase directly heated triode single-ended triode amplifier (abbreviated to DHT SET) is used when directly heated triodes are used.|$|R
25|$|The μA709, which {{followed}} the compromised μA702, became a technical and commercial success. Widlar increased the μA709's voltage gain tenfold over {{that of the}} μA702 (70,000 vs. 7,000), and improved output performance with a push-pull <b>output</b> <b>stage,</b> although the output lacked protection against short circuit. The input stage was governed by a Widlar current source which allowed operation at low currents. The transistors were equipped with beta-compensation resistors to level the inevitable mismatch in their performance. Fairchild R staff spoke against Widlar's decision to employ lateral PNP transistors. Widlar locked himself up for 170 hours of continuous experimental work and {{came out with a}} robust design that blended two resistive diffusion areas into a lateral PNP device.|$|E
25|$|The {{negative}} feedback into the difference amplifier allows the amplifier {{to compare the}} input to the actual output. The amplified signal from Q1 is directly fed to the second stage, Q3, which is a common emitter stage that provides further amplification of the signal and the DC bias for the output stages, Q4 and Q5. R6 provides the load for Q3 (a better design would probably use some form of active load here, such as a constant-current sink). So far, all of the amplifier is operating in class A. The output pair are arranged in class-AB push–pull, also called a complementary pair. They provide {{the majority of the}} current amplification (while consuming low quiescent current) and directly drive the load, connected via DC-blocking capacitor C2. The diodes D1 and D2 provide a small amount of constant voltage bias for the output pair, just biasing them into the conducting state so that crossover distortion is minimized. That is, the diodes push the <b>output</b> <b>stage</b> firmly into class-AB mode (assuming that the base-emitter drop of the output transistors is reduced by heat dissipation).|$|E
25|$|A power {{amplifier}} is an amplifier designed primarily {{to increase the}} power available to a load. In practice, amplifier power gain depends on the source and load impedances, {{as well as the}} inherent voltage and current gain. A radio frequency (RF) amplifier design typically optimizes impedances for power transfer, while audio and instrumentation amplifier designs normally optimize input and output impedance for least loading and highest signal integrity. An amplifier that is said to have a gain of 20dB might have a voltage gain of 20dB and an available power gain of much more than 20dB (power ratio of 100)—yet actually deliver a much lower power gain if, for example, the input is from a 600Ω microphone and the output connects to a 47kΩ input socket for a {{power amplifier}}. In general the power amplifier is the last 'amplifier' or actual circuit in a signal chain (the <b>output</b> <b>stage)</b> and is the amplifier stage that requires attention to power efficiency. Efficiency considerations lead to the various classes of power amplifier based on the biasing of the output transistors or tubes: see power amplifier classes below.|$|E
50|$|Early color {{television}} receivers also used a complex dynamic convergence system, which {{was driven by}} both the horizontal and vertical <b>output</b> <b>stages.</b> Failure of part of this system could overload either tube, though this author has {{never seen such a}} failure in person.|$|R

500|$|The {{amplifier}} {{has what}} the manufacturer calls a [...] "dual-mode power supply", where the <b>output</b> <b>stage</b> is only loosely regulated, {{so it is}} free to supply the high voltages needed for musical transients and the large currents at lower voltages needed for driving low-impedance loads in the power amplifier circuitry. The design also incorporates a separate regulated power supply circuit, fed from a secondary winding on the transformer, dedicated to the pre-amplifier and tone control stages. It is thus claimed that intermodulation distortion and blurring of the stereo image due to power supply functioning cannot occur.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>output</b> <b>stage</b> (Q14, Q20, {{outlined}} in cyan) is a Class AB complementary-symmetry amplifier. It provides an output drive with impedance of ≈50, in essence, current gain.|$|E

30|$|At {{the input}} and <b>output</b> <b>stages,</b> there are multiplications by one, so those multiplications are avoided {{at all in}} our approach. Also, the multiplications by one at the input stage are also avoided {{depending}} on whether DFTDIF−DIT−Pr or DFTDIT−DIF−Pr was executed in the particular employed pruned decomposed transform modality.|$|R
50|$|The <b>output</b> <b>stages</b> of {{professional}} AM radio broadcast transmitters {{of up to}} 50 kW need to be linear and are now usually constructed using solid state technologies.

50|$|This {{configuration}} {{is commonly}} used in the <b>output</b> <b>stages</b> of class-B and class-AB amplifiers. The base circuit is modified to operate the transistor in class-B or AB mode. In class-A mode, sometimes an active current source is used instead of RE (Fig. 4) to improve linearity and/or efficiency.|$|R
