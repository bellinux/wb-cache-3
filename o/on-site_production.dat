2500|$|There are {{two primary}} uses for {{hydrogen}} today. About half {{is used in}} the Haber process to produce ammonia (NH3), which is then used directly or indirectly as fertilizer. Because both the world population and the intensive agriculture used to support it are growing, ammonia demand is growing. The other half of current hydrogen production is used to convert heavy petroleum sources into lighter fractions suitable for use as fuels. This latter process is known as hydrocracking. Hydrocracking represents an even larger growth area, since rising oil prices encourage oil companies to extract poorer source material, such as tar sands and oil shale.

40|$|Bioethanol {{production}} from lignocellulosic raw materials involves process steps like pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, fermentation and distillation. In this study, wheat straw was explored as feedstock for <b>on-site</b> cellulase <b>production</b> by T. reesei 3 EMS 35 mutant, {{and as a}} substrate for second generation bioethanol {{production from}} baker yeast. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffractography (XRD) of untreated wheat straw (UWS) and acid treated wheat straw (TWS) were done to understand the structural organization {{and changes in the}} cellulase accessibility and reactivity. The effect of delignification and structural modification for <b>on-site</b> cellulase enzyme <b>production</b> was comparably studied. The efficiency of crude cellulase enzyme for digestion of UWS and TWS and then production of ethanol from TWS was studied using same-vessel saccharification and fermentation (SVSF) technique, both in shaking flasks as well as in fermenters. Two different methods of operation were tested, i. e. the UWS Enz method, where UWS was used for <b>on-site</b> enzyme <b>production,</b> and TWS Enz method where TWS was applied as substrate for cellullase production. Results obtained showed structural modifications in cellulose of TWS due to delignification, removal of wax and change of crystallinity. UWS was better substrate than TWS for cellulase production {{due to the fact that}} lignin did not hinder the enzyme production by fungus but acted as a booster. On-site cellulase enzyme produced by T. reesei 3 EMS 35 mutant hydrolyzed most of cellulose (91 %) in TWS within first 24 hrs. Shake flasks experiments showed that ethanol titers and yields with UWS Enz were 2. 9 times higher compared to those obtained with TWS Enz method respectively. Comparatively, titer of ethanol in shake flask experiments was 10 % higher than this obtained in 3 L fermenter with UWS Enz. Outcomes from this investigation clearly demonstrated the potential of <b>on-site</b> cellulase enzyme <b>production</b> and SVSF for ethanol production from wheat straw...|$|R

40|$|Techno-economic {{analysis}} was conducted to compare hot water pretreatment and dilute acid pretreatment for biochemical production of ethanol from corn stover, and to compare several enzyme production schemes as alternatives to <b>on-site</b> enzyme <b>production.</b> Each of these scenarios was modeled in detail and economic {{analysis was}} performed to estimate the total capital investment (TCI) and Minimum Ethanol Selling Price (MESP), and Equivalent Purchased Enzyme Price for the enzyme production scenarios. In Chapter 2 hot water and dilute acid pretreatment technologies are compared for both an nth plant design {{as well as a}} pioneer plant. Plants are modeled assuming they receive 2000 MT/day (metric tonne per day) of biomass. The dilute acid pretreatment process has the lowest MESP, which is estimated to be $ 3. 40 /gal EtOH, compared to $ 4. 29 /gal EtOH for the hot water pretreatment scenario. Sensitivity analysis shows that the MESP for the dilute acid pretreatment scenario is most sensitive to feedstock costs, enzyme loading, enzyme cost, and installed equipment costs. The MESP ranges from $ 3. 37 to $ 3. 93 under the assumed ranges for sensitivity parameters. Cellulosic ethanol production has yet to be commercialized and a pioneer plant is expected to be significantly more expensive than an nth plant. To assess the impact of technological maturity on pioneer plant capital cost and plant performance a cost growth analysis was performed using a method developed by the RAND Corporation. Pioneer plant costs are estimated for three scenarios: optimistic, most probable and pessimistic. The estimated range of MESPs for the pioneer plant were substantially larger than for the nth plant. The MESPs for the model with dilute acid pretreatment were $ 4. 19, $ 5. 22 and $ 6. 68 /Gal EtOH for the optimistic, most probable and pessimistic scenarios, respectively. The Total Capital Investmetn (TCI) for the three respective scenarios increased by 54 %, 24 %, and 97 % above the nth plant TCI. Enzymes {{are one of the most}} significant costs of cellulosic ethanol production. Chapter 3 analyzes two enzyme production schemes as alternatives to purchasing enzymes. The first is the <b>production</b> of enzymes <b>on-site</b> for a stand-alone plant. The competitiveness of <b>on-site</b> enzyme <b>production</b> with purchasing enzymes is compared among plant scales varying from 500 MT/day to 3000 MT/day. The second scheme is the production of both ethanol and excess enzymes at a central plant for export to satellite plants producing only ethanol. Two cases were examined for this scheme [...] one in which the central plant supplies enzymes to two satellite plants and another with four satellite plants. Both the central plant and satellite plants in this scheme receive 2000 MT/day of corn stover. For the <b>on-site</b> enzyme <b>production</b> scheme it was found that the competitiveness of <b>on-site</b> enzyme <b>production</b> with purchasing enzymes varies significantly with plant scale. At the 500 MT/day scale <b>on-site</b> enzyme <b>production</b> is economically advantageous at enzyme prices above $ 1. 07 /gal EtOH ($ 7. 82 /kg protein). The competitive price drops to $ 0. 66 /gal EtOH ($ 4. 81 /kg protein) for the 3000 MT/day plant scale. The MESPs for the 500 MT/day and 3000 MT/day are $ 4. 70 and $ 3. 24 /gal EtOH, respectively. The results from the central enzyme production scheme are similar to those of the 2500 MT/day on-site enzyme plant. This scheme is more economically advantageous than purchasing enzymes at enzyme prices higher than $ 0. 71 and $ 0. 69 /gal EtOH ($ 5. 15 and $ 5. 02 /kg protein) for the cases with two and four satellite plants, respectively. The central enzyme production scheme with both two and four satellite plants has lower MESPs than a stand-alone 2000 MT/day plant with <b>on-site</b> enzyme <b>production.</b> This is due primarily to the economy of scale that exists with the enzyme production equipment, resulting in a lower capital cost per gallon of ethanol production capacity...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of <b>on-site</b> renewable energy <b>production</b> and demand management in buildings {{calls for a}} deeper understanding of the interaction between building operation and the electricity grid. Electricity consumption in buildings varies in terms of seasons (heating and cooling), day of the week (professional activities) and hour of the day, which is also the case of <b>on-site</b> electricity <b>production</b> (e. g. photovoltaic systems). Centralised electricity production varies as well according to the demand (e. g. during peak hours). This research aims at improving the evaluation of potential environmental impacts of an energy efficient house attributable to electricity consumption and production by taking into account the temporal variation of the electricity production. Electricity end-uses and <b>on-site</b> electricity <b>production</b> were evaluated on an hourly basis in the case of an energy-efficient house. Another objective was to investigate the sources of errors in the assessment. Life cycle assessment was used to evaluate potential environmental impacts based on electricity production data for the year 2013 in France. Results were compared using an annual average electricity supply mix versus hourly data. This case study demonstrates that the use of an annual average mix instead of hourly mix data can lead to underestimation of potential impacts up to 39 % for Abiotic Depletion Potential (ADP) and 36 % for Global warming potential (GWP) when combining all end-uses. Increase of GWP and ADP when using hourly mix data is mainly explained by higher share of coal and gas power plant in the electricity mix in winter. This coincides with a higher electricity consumption of the studied house in this season due to space heating, electric back-up of the solar water heating system and a lower onsite production (photovoltaic system) ...|$|R

Alternatively, feeding of cow manure during cellulase production by P. oxalicum achieved high lignocellulosic enzyme productivities in the present study.
