5|$|A common neo-creationist {{objection}} to evolution is that evolution does not adhere to normal scientific standards—that {{it is not}} genuinely scientific. It is argued that evolutionary biology does not follow the scientific method and therefore should not be taught in science classes, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> least should be taught alongside other views (i.e., creationism). These objections often deal with {{the very nature of}} evolutionary theory, the scientific method, and philosophy of science.|$|E

Hybrid systems are most often found on islands.|$|E
