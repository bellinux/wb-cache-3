40|$|The {{highland}} region {{forming the}} western {{slopes of the}} Western Ghats of Kerala state, India, is increasingly affected by shallow landslides and consequent debris flows. Many researchers suspected that the spatio-temporal probabilities of shallow landslide initiation {{in this area are}} dependent on the land use which in turn determines the mechanical and hydrological effects of vegetation on slope stability. A physically-based spatially distributed shallow landslide initiation model named STARWARS (Storage and Redistribution of Water on Agricultural and Revegetated Slopes) + PROBSTAB (Probability of Stability) model was identified as the most suitable for this research. This model was calibrated and validated for the Aruvikkal catchment (~ 9 km 2). Climatic and hydrological data necessary for this was acquired from 13 automated <b>open</b> stand <b>pipe</b> <b>piezometers,</b> one discharge station (stage gauge) and one weather station starting from May 2007 onwards. Time series analysis revealed that the discharge of the catchment will respond within 1 hr after a rainfall event while perched water level may need about 6 hrs. Soil properties necessary and the soil depth were measured at representative locations and spatially interpolated using geostatistical techniques. Depending on the dominant plant species in each land use unit and the soil depth the corresponding root reinforcement applicable was derived from measured root tensile strength, pull out strength, root diameter and root density data using the perpendicular root model. Nine species of plants were tested of which Teak (Tectona grandis) trees offered the highest amounts of net root reinforcement. In order to evaluate the effects of long term and short term land use changes on slope stability in the region, historic (1913 to 2008) land use maps, soil depth maps and root reinforcement maps were derived. In addition the land use maps and corresponding root reinforcement maps of two future scenarios (2016 and 2058) were also derived. These data sets were used to simulate the corresponding slope stability and probability of failure conditions based on the 1985 rainfall time series which included the most extreme daily rainfall that has caused at least one shallow landslide in the study area in the past 57 years. In light of the empirical observations and the modelling results it can be concluded that a continuous rain storm of 4 to 26 hrs, totaling about 106 to 290 mm can cause a steep rise in the perched water table up to critical levels in regolith filled bedrock depressions and the persistence of this level for ~ 10 hrs may lead to shallow landslides in the study area. It was evident that land use changes which occurred {{in the early part of}} 20 th century have reduced the root cohesion and altered the soil depth significantly by terracing. The land use changes from the pre-plantation (1913) scenario to present (2008) have resulted in an average increase in the potential area of failure by 43 % and the spatio-temporal probability of failure by 49 %. Thus, the research showed that in the study area the transition probability of land use change (and consequently the changes in soil depth and root cohesion) outweighs the rainfall quantity in determining the spatio-temporal probability of shallow landslide occurrence. This is in contradiction with the commonly held belief that the temporal probability of shallow landslides can be quantified with only the return probability of landslide-causing extreme rainfall events. Hence, transition probabilities of land use should be assessed and incorporated in regional scale landslide hazard assessments that utilize heuristic and stochastic techniques, especially in such anthropogenically modified terrain...|$|R
40|$|Soil-pipes (porous pipes {{inside a}} hillslope) are often {{detected}} in collapsed slopes indicating {{their influence on}} slope failure processes. Only limited studies can be found regarding the impacts of soil-pipes on landslide mechanisms. Hillslope models prepared in a flume are experimented with different soil-pipe configurations: a) no pipe, b) closed <b>pipe</b> and c) <b>open</b> <b>pipe.</b> Pore-water pressures were measured at six different locations along a slope. Discharges at the outlet of soil-pipe and groundwater seepage were also recorded. For the above mentioned pipe configurations two types of experiments were conducted: a) rainfall-induced failure and b) seepage-induced failure. Experimental results show that a closed pipe accumulates water around its lower end and continuously increases pore-water pressure till a failure. An <b>open</b> <b>pipe</b> works {{as a means of}} hillslope drainage and reduces the pore-water pressure of an entire slope. However, if <b>open</b> <b>pipe</b> is blocked, pore-water pressure close to its lower end rises rapidly, leading to immediate soil mass movement. For both seepage and rainfall-induced failure experiments, the maximum pressure before the failure was larger at a slope with an <b>open</b> <b>pipe</b> (once it is closed) than a slope with a pipe closed from the beginning or that without a soil-pipe. This indicates that the blockage of soil-pipes makes a slope more susceptible to failure. Displacement vectors show that soil movement velocity close to the surface was highest at slopes with <b>open</b> <b>pipes</b> after closure and lowest at slopes without pipes because of a higher degree of saturation and pore-water pressure at the time of failure of the former. Before a large failure, small fluctuations in pore-water pressure were also observed which can be an indicator of impending failure...|$|R
