5|$|The {{development}} of comparative philology in the 19th century, together with ethnological discoveries in the 20th century, established the science <b>of</b> <b>myth.</b> Since the Romantics, all study <b>of</b> <b>myth</b> has been comparative. Wilhelm Mannhardt, James Frazer, and Stith Thompson employed the comparative approach {{to collect and}} classify the themes of folklore and mythology. In 1871 Edward Burnett Tylor published his Primitive Culture, in which he applied the comparative method {{and tried to explain}} the origin and evolution of religion.* Robert A. Segal, Theorizing about Myth, 16 Tylor's procedure of drawing together material culture, ritual and myth of widely separated cultures influenced both Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell. Max Müller applied the new science of comparative mythology to the study <b>of</b> <b>myth,</b> in which he detected the distorted remains of Aryan nature worship. Bronisław Malinowski emphasized the ways myth fulfills common social functions. Claude Lévi-Strauss and other structuralists have compared the formal relations and patterns in myths throughout the world.|$|E
5|$|Roman Academic Cotta ridicules both {{literal and}} allegorical {{acceptance}} <b>of</b> <b>myth,</b> declaring roundly that myths {{have no place}} in philosophy. Cicero is also generally disdainful <b>of</b> <b>myth,</b> but, like Varro, he is emphatic in his support for the state religion and its institutions. It is difficult to know how far down the social scale this rationalism extended. Cicero asserts that no one (not even old women and boys) is so foolish as to believe in the terrors of Hades or the existence of Scyllas, centaurs or other composite creatures, but, on the other hand, the orator elsewhere complains of the superstitious and credulous character of the people. De Natura Deorum is the most comprehensive summary of Cicero's line of thought.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{exploratory}} examination of identity construction and children’s media, {{with a focus}} on the Palestinian political groups of Fatah and Hamas. It looks at how children’s media are framed {{within the context of the}} Arab-Israeli conflict. It examines how internal and external social factors contribute to identity formation and the interaction among these elements during times of conflict and war. This thesis hypothesizes that both Fatah and Hamas use various myths to differing degrees in order to frame their conception of a Palestinian identity. Specifically, it explores the use <b>of</b> the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Battle, the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Hero, the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Victim, the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Religion, the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Land and the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Other. It seeks to determine which <b>of</b> these <b>myths</b> each group emphasizes through a qualitative and quantitative visual ethnographic content analysis. The quantitative analysis uncovered interesting, albeit not statistically significant, differences between Fatah’s and Hamas’ use of all <b>of</b> the <b>myths</b> in their videos. Specifically it found that both groups made equal and great use <b>of</b> the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Religion; that Hamas produced the videos with the greatest focus on the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Battle and the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Hero; and that neither group greatly emphasized the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Victim, the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Land or the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Other. Finally, the analysis discovered positive correlations between the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Hero and the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Battle as well as between the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Battle and the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Other...|$|R

5|$|The {{director}} {{relied on}} a change of locale to inspire him to write Pi and Requiem for a Dream. For The Fountain, Aronofsky {{was inspired by a}} research trip he took to Guatemala with Handel to learn about Mayan history and philosophy. The script for The Fountain was influenced by the accounts of Uruguayan journalist Eduardo Galeano, who wrote examples <b>of</b> <b>myth</b> from an indigenous perspective, particularly Galeano's Genesis trilogy. The film Once Upon a Time in America also served as an influence on the script. Aronofsky, influenced by Bernal Díaz del Castillo's The Conquest of New Spain, applied the narrative in writing the film's conquistador scenes.|$|E

The Penelopiad was translated into 28 languages and released simultaneously around the world by 33 publishers, including Canongate Books in the UK, Knopf in Canada, Grove/Atlantic Inc. in the US, and Text Publishing in Australia and New Zealand. The French translation was published in Canada by Éditions du Boréal and in France by Groupe Flammarion. The trade paperback was released in 2006. Laural Merlington narrated the 3-hour unabridged audiobook which was published by Brilliance Audio and released alongside the hardcover.

40|$|This {{article is}} an attempt at {{presenting}} Mircea Eliade’s classification <b>of</b> <b>myths.</b> Despite {{the fact that the}} Romanian scholar did not attach great importance to the formal definition <b>of</b> the <b>myth,</b> both his definition and classification <b>of</b> <b>myths</b> reveal a very interesting structure of the mythical vision of the world.

5|$|This {{game was}} {{designed}} at Nintendo's Research and Development 1 (R) division, while the programming was {{handled by the}} external company Intelligent Systems (known as Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena at the time). The game was developed for the Family Computer Disk System (FDS) because the peripheral's Disk Card media allowed for three times the storage capacity of the Family Computer's (and NES's) console's cartridges. Combined with the possibility to store the players' progress, the floppy disk format enabled the developers to create a longer game with a more extensive game world. Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena was Toru Osawa's debut as a video game designer, {{and he was the}} only staff member working on the game {{at the beginning of the}} project. Osawa (credited in the U.S. version as Inusawa) intended to make Light Myth: Palutena's Mirror an action game with role-playing elements, and wrote a story rooted in Greek mythology, which he had always been fond of. He drew the pixel art, and wrote the technical specifications, which were the basis for the playable prototype that was programmed by Intelligent Systems. After Nintendo's action-adventure Metroid had been finished, more staff members were allotted to the development <b>of</b> <b>Myth</b> of Light: The Mirror of Palutena.|$|E
5|$|Rationalizing hermeneutics <b>of</b> <b>myth</b> {{became even}} more popular under the Roman Empire, thanks to the physicalist {{theories}} of Stoic and Epicurean philosophy. Stoics presented explanations of the gods and heroes as physical phenomena, while the Euhemerists rationalized them as historical figures. At the same time, the Stoics and the Neoplatonists promoted the moral significations of the mythological tradition, often based on Greek etymologies. Through his Epicurean message, Lucretius had sought to expel superstitious fears from the minds of his fellow-citizens. Livy, too, is skeptical about the mythological tradition and claims {{that he does not}} intend to pass judgement on such legends (fabulae). The challenge for Romans with a strong and apologetic sense of religious tradition was to defend that tradition while conceding that it was often a breeding-ground for superstition. The antiquarian Varro, who regarded religion as a human institution with great importance for the preservation of good in society, devoted rigorous study to the origins of religious cults. In his Antiquitates Rerum Divinarum (which has not survived, but Augustine's City of God indicates its general approach) Varro argues that whereas the superstitious man fears the gods, the truly religious person venerates them as parents. According to Varro, there have been three accounts of deities in the Roman society: the mythical account created by poets for theatre and entertainment, the civil account used by people for veneration {{as well as by the}} city, and the natural account created by the philosophers. The best state is, adds Varro, where the civil theology combines the poetic mythical account with the philosopher's.|$|E

50|$|David Wiles {{points that}} the {{traditional}} mythos of Ancient Greece, was primarily a part of its oral tradition.

Instead multiple variants <b>of</b> <b>myths</b> were in circulation. These variants were adapted into songs, dances, poetry, and visual art.
