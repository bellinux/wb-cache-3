The programme is conducted by the Croatian Red Cross, the Ministry of Science, Education and Sports {{and a number of}} NGOs in cooperation with the Croatian Mine Action Centre. The Croatian Mine Action Centre actively supports NGOs to develop as many programmes as possible and attract new NGOs to mine-awareness and educational activities.

5|$|The massive {{amount of}} {{exponentially}} growing sequence data is a daunting challenge that {{is complicated by the}} complexity of the metadata associated with metagenomic projects. Metadata includes detailed information about the three-dimensional (including depth, or height) geography and environmental features of the sample, physical data about the sample site, and the methodology of the sampling. This information is necessary both to ensure replicability and to enable downstream analysis. Because of its importance, metadata and collaborative data review and curation require standardized data formats located in specialized databases, such as the Genomes <b>OnLine</b> <b>Database</b> (GOLD).|$|E
5|$|Many viruses can be {{synthesised}} de novo ("from scratch") and {{the first}} synthetic virus was created in 2002. Although somewhat of a misconception, {{it is not the}} actual virus that is synthesised, but rather its DNA genome (in case of a DNA virus), or a cDNA copy of its genome (in case of RNA viruses). For many virus families the naked synthetic DNA or RNA (once enzymatically converted back from the synthetic cDNA) is infectious when introduced into a cell. That is, they contain all the necessary information to produce new viruses. This technology is now being used to investigate novel vaccine strategies. The ability to synthesise viruses has far-reaching consequences, since viruses can no longer be regarded as extinct, as long as the information of their genome sequence is known and permissive cells are available. , the full-length genome sequences of 3843 different viruses, including smallpox, are publicly available in an <b>online</b> <b>database</b> maintained by the National Institutes of Health.|$|E

40|$|Describes {{a survey}} of 26 {{libraries}} at private colleges and universities (PCU) in Malaysia to ascertain the types of access given to <b>online</b> <b>databases.</b> The PCUs include (a) private colleges that offer franchised undergraduate programmes in collaboration with foreign universities; (b) institutions that are branch campuses of foreign universities; and (c) Malaysian-based PCUs that are owned by Malaysian corporations. Out of the 26 PCUs, only 8 out of 19 colleges and 7 local private universities and foreign branch campuses provide access to <b>online</b> <b>databases</b> to their students. The types of access given are: (a) the private universities provide access to <b>online</b> <b>databases</b> that they subscribe through their own funding and control usage through a mixture of user name/password and IP-based access; (b) the foreign universities with branch campuses in Malaysia provide access by three modes (<b>online</b> <b>databases</b> subscribed from branch campusâ��s own funding; <b>online</b> <b>databases</b> subscribed by foreign partner university; <b>online</b> <b>databases</b> subscribed by local branch campus own funding {{as well as those}} subscribed by the foreign partner university). Almost all PCUs provide their undergraduates with computer facilities to access the databases. A variety of methods are used to promote usage, which include library induction, library brochures, library notices and providing links through the libraryâ��s own web pages. Most PCUs do not charge for access and provide users with the option to print, download or receive documents...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} remain {{relevant}} in today's society, museums are increasingly utilizing the Internet by creating <b>online</b> collections <b>databases.</b> However, the museum field has not reached {{a consensus on}} how these databases should be built. History museums often face the greatest challenge in creating <b>online</b> <b>databases</b> because of {{the wide variety of}} their holdings, minimal budgets, and small staff. This thesis analyzes the methods by which collections managers at history museums are creating and maintaining <b>online</b> collections <b>databases.</b> A review of the published literature is conducted, followed by three case studies of history museums in Northern California, including interviews with collections managers. A practical resource for history museums that are creating or updating their <b>online</b> <b>databases</b> is then presented.
