500|$|A typical {{killer whale}} distinctively bears a black back, white chest and sides, {{and a white}} patch above and behind the eye. Calves are born with a {{yellowish}} or <b>orange</b> <b>tint,</b> which fades to white. It has a heavy and robust body with a large dorsal fin up to [...] tall. Behind the fin, it has a dark grey [...] "saddle patch" [...] across the back. Antarctic killer whales may have pale gray to nearly white backs. Adult killer whales are very distinctive and are not usually confused with any other sea creature. When seen from a distance, juveniles can be confused with other cetacean species, such as the false killer whale or Risso's dolphin. The killer whale's teeth are very strong and its jaws exert a powerful grip; the upper teeth fall into the gaps between the lower teeth when the mouth is closed. The front teeth are inclined slightly forward and outward, thus allowing the killer whale to withstand powerful jerking movements from its prey while the middle and back teeth hold it firmly in place.|$|E
500|$|The stem is [...] long, [...] thick, and is {{attached}} {{to the center of the}} cap. It tapers slightly towards the apex, and is solid, dry, white or sometimes with a pale <b>orange</b> <b>tint,</b> and covered with tufts of soft woolly hairs. If handled, the stem will slowly bruise and discolor to approximately the same color as the cap. The basal bulb is large, reaching up to , and is broadly spindle- to turnip-shaped. The bulb has a circular ridge on its upper part where the universal veil was previously attached, and the bulb may have longitudinal splits. It is covered with pinkish to reddish veil remains. The partial veil forms an ephemeral ring on the upper part of the stem. It is white to pale yellow, and usually falls off as the cap expands; fragments of the ring may often be found lying on the ground near the base of the stem. The universal veil remnants, when present, are similar to that on the cap. The flesh is firm and white. Fruit bodies have an odor that is strong and unpleasant, described as [...] "sweet and nauseous". The odor has also been compared to that of [...] "an old ham bone or soap" [...] or [...] "decaying protein", especially older specimens.|$|E
2500|$|Buckskin horses {{have a black}} mane and tail, {{but instead}} of a red or brown coat, they have a cream or gold coat. [...] Though once called a [...] "Sandy" [...] bay in older texts on horse color, the genetic {{distinction}} created by the cream gene is significant. [...] They are a bay horse that is also heterozygous for the dominant creme (CCr) allele. The black pigment remains largely unchanged, but any red pigment in the coat is diluted to gold. [...] Buckskins are seldom mistaken for bays because their coats are significantly lighter and have no hint of a red or <b>orange</b> <b>tint.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{spore print}} is dark brownish. The spores are 4.5-6.0 x 3.5-4.0 µm on average, nonamyloid, and elliptical. The flesh turns {{slightly}} in yellow when cut or bruised, sometime with <b>orange</b> <b>tints</b> in stipe.|$|R
2500|$|The {{pectoral}} fins are small, broad, and rounded; the pelvic fins {{are similar}} {{and almost as}} large. The two dorsal fins have straight trailing margins and are spaced well apart. The first dorsal fin is as large or larger than the pelvic fins, originating behind {{the middle of the}} pelvic fin bases. The second dorsal fin is slightly smaller than the first but has a longer base. There is a prominent midline ridge along the back, which continues between the dorsal fins. The long, keel-like anal fin originates behind the second dorsal fin. The caudal fin is low and lacks a lower lobe; the upper lobe has a strong ventral notch near the tip. Adults are a plain tan color above and white below, sometimes with an <b>orange</b> <b>tint</b> on the fin margins; juveniles have faint lighter spots on the fins.

Exasperated out of his quiet superciliousness, without looking at anyone right or left, he accosted Massy straightway in so determined a manner that the engineer, taken aback, began to stammer unintelligibly. Nothing could be heard but the words: [...] "Mr. Van Wyk [...] . Indeed, Mr. Van Wyk [...] . For the future, Mr. Van Wyk"--and by the suffusion of blood Massy's vast bilious face acquired an unnatural <b>orange</b> <b>tint,</b> out of which the disconcerted coal-black eyes shone in an extraordinary manner.|$|E
60|$|In museums a {{vast amount}} of {{difference}} is seen in the colours of this species, caused by the method of preparation: if dried without having been in spirits, and subsequently kept dry, the <b>orange</b> <b>tint</b> round the orifice is preserved; if kept long in spirits, this is quite lost; but sometimes in specimens in spirits the colour of the membrane of peduncle is preserved and rendered pinker. The colours of the sack and animal are either quite discharged or rendered extremely dark. The valves themselves also often become more opaque. In some specimens well preserved in spirits, the sack and cirri were purplish-brown or lead-colour, tinted with dirty green, or orange, or bright yellow, or brick-red.|$|E

60|$|Mrs Verloc’s mother’s {{complexion}} {{had become}} yellow by {{the effect of}} age and from a natural predisposition to biliousness, favoured by the trials of a difficult and worried existence, first as wife, then as widow. It was a complexion, that {{under the influence of}} a blush would take on an <b>orange</b> <b>tint.</b> And this woman, modest indeed but hardened in the fires of adversity, of an age, moreover, when blushes are not expected, had positively blushed before her daughter. In the privacy of a four-wheeler, on her way to a charity cottage (one of a row) which by the exiguity of its dimensions and the simplicity of its accommodation, might well have been devised in kindness as a place of training for the still more straitened circumstances of the grave, she was forced to hid from her own child a blush of remorse and shame.|$|E
60|$|Colours.--When fresh, valves blueish-grey {{from the}} {{underlying}} corium, edges {{of all the}} valves and round the orifice, and round {{the top of the}} peduncle, bright orange-yellow, passing into the finest scarlet, and varying slightly in tint in different specimens. Space between the carina and the other valves, and between the occludent margins of the scuta, rich purplish-brown; peduncle either pale or purplish-brown, or only clouded on the sides with the same. In young specimens, peduncle nearly colourless; and in those under a quarter of an inch long in the capitulum, the top of the peduncle has not acquired its <b>orange</b> <b>tint.</b> Sack pale, leaden-purple, body the same, but paler and more reddish; cirri (but only the tips of first pair) tinted with fine golden orange. Immature ova in peduncle beautiful blue. After being long kept in spirits, the colours are changed, weakened, or discharged, as in L. anatifera and L. anserifera, and the valves become opaque. In some long-kept specimens the corium everywhere had become pale brown; more usually it assumes a dirty purplish lead-colour.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned her}} face landward and {{strained}} her eyes to discern, if possible, some sign of Owen's return. Nothing was visible save the strikingly brilliant, still landscape. The wide concave which lay {{at the back of}} the hill in this direction was blazing with the western light, adding an <b>orange</b> <b>tint</b> to the vivid purple of the heather, now at the very climax of bloom, and free from the slightest touch of the invidious brown that so soon creeps into its shades. The light so intensified the colours that they seemed to stand above the surface of the earth and float in mid-air like an exhalation of red. In the minor valleys, between the hillocks and ridges which diversified the contour of the basin, but did not disturb its general sweep, she marked brakes of tall, heavy-stemmed ferns, five or six feet high, in a brilliant light-green dress--a broad riband of them with the path in their midst winding like a stream along the little ravine that reached to the foot of the hill, and delivered up the path to its grassy area. Among the ferns grew holly bushes deeper in tint than any shadow about them, whilst the whole surface of the scene was dimpled with small conical pits, and here and there were round ponds, now dry, and half overgrown with rushes.|$|E

50|$|Agaricus santacatalinensis is {{a species}} of agaric fungus. Described as new to science in 1998 by Edgardo Albertó, it is found in {{deciduous}} forests of Brazil, where it grows under privets (Ligustrum) and elm (Ulmus). The fruit bodies feature caps that are 7 - 12 cm in diameter with felt-like surfaces. Somewhat unusually, the gills mature centrifugally (from the cap center outward to the edge). Initially, they are ochre yellow before turning dark brown after the spores mature. The stipe measures 8.5 - 12 cm long by 1.5 - 2 cm thick. It is white from the cap down to the ring, below which it becomes yellowish with <b>orange</b> <b>tints.</b> The base of the stipe has short yellowish rhizomorphs. The ring is membranous, measuring 1-2 mm thick. The edibility of the mushroom is unknown.|$|R
