5|$|The bill's passage was {{met with}} concern by Catholic authorities, {{including}} Pope John Paul II — who warned of a weakening <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>values</b> — and his successor Pope Benedict XVI. Cardinal López Trujillo, president of the Pontifical Council for the Family, said the Church was making an urgent call for freedom of conscience for Catholics and appealing to them to resist the law. He said every profession linked with implementing same-sex marriages should oppose it, {{even if it meant}} losing their jobs. Gay rights supporters argued that while the Catholic Church also formally opposed opposite-sex, non-religious marriage, its opposition was not as vocal; for example, the Church did not object to the marriage of Prince Felipe to Letizia Ortiz, who had divorced from a previous civil marriage. The church was unable to gather enough support to derail the bill, even though 80% of Spaniards identify as members of the Catholic Faith. Sociologists believe {{this may be due to}} the significant increase of liberalism in the realm of individual rights in recent years, where the Church traditionally had most influence, especially on family issues. A poll showed that three quarters of Spaniards believe the church hierarchy is out of touch with social reality. A complementary explanation might be that the Church's influence on Spaniards declined after the death in 1975 of the dictator General Francisco Franco, whose regime was closely linked to the Church.|$|E

25|$|West Ham United is {{frequently}} mentioned among the locals at The Queen Victoria tavern in the BBC soap opera EastEnders, created by Tony Holland and Julia Smith.

25|$|Those mining {{communities}} {{had good}} working class values {{and a sense}} <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>values.</b> The men did real men's heavy work going down the pit. There were also some very close-knit communities which were {{able to deal with}} the few troublesome kids. If they had any problems they would take the kid round the back and give them a good clip round the ear {{and that would be the}} end of that. Many of these communities were completely devastated, with people out of work turning to drugs and no real man's work because all the jobs had gone. There is no doubt that this led to a breakdown in these communities with families breaking up and youths going out of control. The scale of the closures went too far. The damage done to those communities was enormous as a result of the strike.|$|E
25|$|On 22–23 October, 6,500 Jewish Germans and Gentile Germans of Jewish {{descent from}} Baden and the Palatinate were {{deported}} to Gurs, occupied France. Now Grüber got himself a passport, {{with the help}} of Dietrich Bonhoeffer's brother-in-law Hans von Dohnanyi from the Abwehr, to visit the deported in the Gurs (concentration camp). But before he left the Gestapo arrested Grüber on 19 December and deported him two days later to Sachsenhausen concentration camp, and in 1941 to Dachau concentration camp, becoming the inmate with the No. 27832. For 18 December 1942 Grüber's wife Margarete, still living in the rectory of the Kaulsdorf congregation, managed to get a visitor's permit to speak him, accompanied by their elder son Hans-Rolf, for 30 min. in Dachau, arguing that he, being the husband and thus according to the garbled Nazi ideas <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>values</b> the decision-taking party in the family, would have to decide about important financial matters, about which he would have to instruct the remaining eldest, though minor, male family member. Grüber survived Dachau and built up good relations with many other inmates, among them also communists. He was released from Dachau to his wife Margarete, née Vits and their three children Ingeborg, Hans-Rolf, and Ernst-Hartmut in Kaulsdorf on 23 June 1943, after he signed not to help the persecuted any more.|$|E

500|$|The {{painting}} {{shows an}} aproned matriarch presenting a roasted turkey {{to a family}} of several generations, in Rockwell's idealistic presentation <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>values.</b> The patriarch looks on with fondness and approval {{from the head of}} the table, which is the central element of the painting. Its creased tablecloth shows that this is a special occasion for [...] "sharing what we have with those we love", according to Lennie Bennett. The table has a bowl of fruit, celery, pickles, and what appears to be cranberry sauce. There is a covered silver serving dish that would traditionally hold potatoes, according to Richard Halpern, but Bennett describes this as a covered casserole dish. The servings are less prominent than the presentation of white linen, white plates and water-filled glasses. The people in the painting are not yet eating, and the painting contrasts the empty plates and vacant space in their midst with images of overabundance.|$|E
500|$|Development and {{production}} for Tucker: The Man and His Dream included {{the involvement of}} Tucker's children and grandchildren. Jeff Bridges was cast {{in the title role}} and, for research, studied Preston Tucker's mannerisms and movements through home movies. Tucker's descendants also granted Bridges the opportunity to sport the man's black pearl ring and cuff links for his wardrobe. Preston's son, John Tucker, said that Bridges has [...] "got it all in the mannerisms and the look. My father was very positive, always thinking of what came next. Jeff captures that." [...] Martin Landau was enthusiastic about accepting the pivotal role of Abe Karatz as a means to avoid typecasting. The construct <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>values</b> {{played a crucial role in}} the Tuckers' life and Coppola studiously selected Joan Allen for the part of Vera, Tucker's devoted wife while Christian Slater and Elias Koteas fill in the other central roles of eldest son and Tucker's friend and confederate, Alex Tremulis. Coppola's family was undergoing a stressful time during the production and he dedicated the film to Gio, his eldest son, who died before filming began.|$|E

The results from another replication I conducted on comparable German data further corroborate my argument (Ochsenfeld 2016 b).|$|R

2500|$|Carlson {{argues that}} the family's {{greatest}} challenge in the early 21st century comes from what he calls [...] "soft totalitarianisms", which are [...] "packaged around a militant secular individualism, but still seeking to build a marriage-free, post-family order." [...] This includes same-sex marriage, the Left's association <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>values</b> with abortion, and [...] "equity feminism". Samuel T. Francis uses similar ideas to argue that society should regulate sexual behavior, specifically laws against sodomy and gays in the military.|$|E
2500|$|During his Senate {{campaign}} in Massachusetts in 1994, Romney {{said that he}} would support federal funding to schools to teach the importance <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>values,</b> ethics, and personal economics, but that he was opposed to public schools' endorsing any specific religious beliefs or teaching prayer. [...] More recently, during his presidential campaigns in 2007 and 2012, he said that while he was not seeking for teachers to lead their classes in prayer in public schools every day, he did believe it to be appropriate for there to be public recognition of the Creator in public schools at graduation ceremonies, football games, and other school events, and he also said that he supported the display of religious symbols such as Nativity scenes in the public square during holidays.|$|E

Amidst the intricate caper, the song emphasizes the importance <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>values.</b> As Common says in the song's intro [...] "I don't know what was on y'all niggaz birds {{to go up to the}} boat - and start robbin old folks". The song ends in a skit involving police officers at the scene of a crime where, breaking out of character, one of the officers can be heard saying [...] "the skit definitely needs more added to it... Someone get Prince Paul on the phone please" [...] - the last remark being a recognition of Prince Paul's reputation as a pioneer of the album skit.|$|E

2500|$|The next {{companion}} Dorothy meets on {{the yellow}} brick road is the Tin Woodman {{who has been}} cursed by the now deceased Wicked Witch of the East. He was once a hard worker yearning to earn money {{to start a family}} with a Munchkin girl. The witch enchanted his axe so that the Woodman chopped off each of his limbs and eventually his body. Each time a tinner healed the Woodman by replacing his body with tin, however once the Tin Woodman's heart was removed he could no longer love. The Tin Woodman symbolizes the Eastern working man competing in an industrialized society. The 19th-century man had {{to keep up with the}} machine in order to be useful and relevant. In this way the Witch of the East's curse [...] "dehumanized a simple laborer so that the faster and better he worked the more quickly he became a kind of machine." [...] The Tin Woodman was caught in the rain and rusted in the same position for one year before Dorothy oils his joints to set him free. The Tin Woodman's year of waiting is parallel to the unemployment of Eastern workers during the severe depression of 1893-1897. His calls of help that were never heard relate to President Grover Cleveland's [...] "hard-hearted refusal" [...] to take action during this time to reinstate the economy. While the Tin Woodman stood still for a year, he finally slowed down enough to ponder life. During this time, he discovers that [...] "the greatest loss [...] had known was the loss of [...] heart" [...] for without it he cannot love. Baum portrays the Tin Woodman as an Eastern worker who lost sight <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>values</b> for a moment. [...] Part of the Progressive movement in the 19th century was to reestablish the family as the center of American life. The curse of the Tin Woodman by the Wicked Witch of the East is consistent with the depiction of the witch representing Wall Street and other Eastern big businesses during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E
