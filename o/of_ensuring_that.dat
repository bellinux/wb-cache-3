5|$|On 18 November, while Allenby {{was at the}} British XXI Corps {{headquarters}} at El Kastine, {{the decision was made}} to closely follow the Ottoman Seventh Army into the Judean Hills. This was in the hope <b>of</b> <b>ensuring</b> <b>that</b> the Ottoman army had little time to regroup or construct defences which, given more time, might prove impregnable.|$|E
5|$|Like all Canadian provinces, Manitoba {{is governed}} by a unicameral {{legislative}} assembly. The executive branch is formed by the governing party; the party leader is the premier of Manitoba, {{the head of the}} executive branch. The head of state, Queen ElizabethII, is represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba, who is appointed by the Governor General of Canada on advice of the Prime Minister. The head of state is primarily a ceremonial role, although the Lieutenant Governor has the official responsibility <b>of</b> <b>ensuring</b> <b>that</b> Manitoba has a duly constituted government.|$|E
5|$|In October 1980, he {{interacted with}} a {{delegation}} of Solidarity members that included Lech Wałęsa, future President of the Third Republic of Poland. When Wałęsa complained that the Polish government was not keeping to its promise of allowing the independent labour movement enough of an opportunity to publicize itself, Jagielski indicated that {{he would try to}} give the movement better access to the Polish press, and to the Polish radio network. Jagielski led a delegation that went to a meeting in Moscow of Comecon, the Eastern Bloc economic community, during January 1981. That month, the government declared that the poor economy was forcing it to cut back on its promise <b>of</b> <b>ensuring</b> <b>that</b> Polish workers did not have to work on Saturdays, and that it would offer a number of Saturdays as work-free instead.|$|E

5|$|In {{ex parte}} Hosenball, Lord Denning {{referred}} to Lord Reid's comments in R. v. Lewes Justices, ex parte Secretary of State for Home Department (1972), {{that there was}} a public interest for certain documents in the police's possession not to be produced during court proceedings, otherwise members of the public might withhold information from the police if they realized the potential existed for the information to be disclosed to the Gaming Board. Such withholding of information would prevent the police from properly discharging their statutory duty <b>of</b> <b>ensuring</b> <b>that</b> unsuitable persons were not granted licences to run gaming establishments. Lord Reid stated that the requirement for natural justice in that case was clearly outweighed by the public interest.|$|E
5|$|With the Eastern Front {{entering}} Polish territories in 1944, the Home Army {{established an}} uneasy truce with the Soviets. Even so, the main Red Army and NKVD forces conducted operations against Home Army partisans, including during or directly after Poland's Operation Tempest, which the Poles had envisioned to be a joint Polish-Soviet operation against the retreating Germans which would also establish Polish claims to those territories. The Home Army helped Soviet units with scouting assistance, uprisings, and assistance in liberating some cities (e.g., Operation Ostra Brama in Vilnius, and the Lwów Uprising), {{only to find}} that immediately afterwards Home Army troops were arrested, imprisoned–even executed. Unknown to the Poles, their Operation Tempest had been fatally flawed from the start due to Joseph Stalin's intention <b>of</b> <b>ensuring</b> <b>that</b> an independent Poland would never re-emerge after the war.|$|E
5|$|In Ireland, the {{population}} was split into three main socio-political groups: the Gaelic Irish, who were Catholic; the Old English, who were descended from medieval Normans and were also predominantly Catholic; and the New English, who were Protestant settlers from England and Scotland aligned with the English Parliament and the Covenanters. Strafford's administration had improved the Irish economy and boosted tax revenue, but had done so by heavy-handedly imposing order. He had trained up a large Catholic army {{in support of the}} king and had weakened the authority of the Irish Parliament, while continuing to confiscate land from Catholics for Protestant settlement {{at the same time as}} promoting a Laudian Anglicanism that was anathema to Presbyterians. As a result, all three groups had become disaffected. Strafford's impeachment provided a new departure for Irish politics whereby all sides joined together to present evidence against him. In a similar manner to the English Parliament, the Old English members of the Irish Parliament argued that while opposed to Strafford they remained loyal to Charles. They argued that the king had been led astray by malign counsellors, and that, moreover, a viceroy such as Strafford could emerge as a despotic figure instead <b>of</b> <b>ensuring</b> <b>that</b> the king was directly involved in governance.|$|E

5|$|Most {{countries}} place {{dietary supplements}} {{in a special}} category under the general umbrella of foods, not drugs. As a result, the manufacturer, and not the government, has the responsibility <b>of</b> <b>ensuring</b> <b>that</b> its dietary supplement products are safe before they are marketed. Regulation of supplements varies widely by country. In the United States, a dietary supplement is defined under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. There is no FDA approval process for dietary supplements, and no requirement that manufacturers prove the safety or efficacy of supplements introduced before 1994. The Food and Drug Administration must rely on its Adverse Event Reporting System to monitor adverse events that occur with supplements. In 2007, the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21, part III took effect, regulating Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) in the manufacturing, packaging, labeling, or holding operations for dietary supplements. Even though product registration is not required, these regulations mandate production and quality control standards (including testing for identity, purity and adulterations) for dietary supplements. In the European Union, the Food Supplements Directive requires that only those supplements that have been proven safe can be sold without a prescription.|$|E
5|$|On 17 September 1374, Louis granted various {{concessions}} to the Polish nobility by the Privilege of Koszyce, {{in exchange for their}} promise that a daughter of his would succeed him and that he, Elizabeth or his mother could indicate which one. In Hungary, he focused on the centralization of power as means <b>of</b> <b>ensuring</b> <b>that</b> his daughters' rights would be respected. Securing marriage to one of the princesses was a priority in European royal courts. Mary was scarcely one year old when she was promised to Sigismund of Luxembourg. In 1374, Catherine was betrothed to Louis of France, but died towards the end of 1378. The same year, Hedwig, promised to William of Austria in a sponsalia de futuro, left her mother's court and moved to Vienna, where she spent the next two years. The Polish lords swore to uphold Mary's rights in 1379, while Sigismund received this recognition three years later. Elizabeth was present, along with her husband and mother-in-law, at a meeting in Zólyom on 12 February 1380, whereby Hungarian lords confirmed Hedwig's Austrian match; this indicates that Louis may have intended to leave Hungary to Hedwig and William.|$|E
5|$|In 1206 William was {{in charge}} of the naval forces in the Cinque Ports and {{commanded}} the fleet that invaded Poitou. Whether he accompanied the fleet or stayed in England after it sailed is unclear; according to two historians– F. W. Brooks and R. W. Powell– it is more likely he stayed. From 1206 until 1215 he was effectively commander of King John's navy, and helped to develop Portsmouth as a royal dockyard. In 1208 William was put in charge <b>of</b> <b>ensuring</b> <b>that</b> no ships sailed without royal permission. That year he also oversaw the naval preparations made by the Cinque Ports. The purpose of these preparations is unknown; the Annals of Dunstable ascribe to John a desire to oppress the Cinque Ports. During May 1208 a royal order was issued that William's deputies in all the seaports should seize any ships in the ports that were from foreign countries, excluding Denmark, Norway and other countries that did not oppose John's diplomatic efforts. A gap in the governmental records does not allow a detailed view of William's activities for the next years, until 1212, when William is shown performing many of the same duties as earlier. He {{was in charge}} of repair of some ships and the construction of a large new ship, named the Deulabenit, owned by the king. William was also responsible for impressing privately owned merchant ships into royal service. These ships were used in the naval action of the Battle of Damme at Zwyn in 1213, when a fleet under William Longespee, the Earl of Salisbury, destroyed a substantial French naval force and sacked the town of Damme.|$|E
