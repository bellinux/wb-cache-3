50|$|<b>Oxaflozane</b> (INN) (brand name Conflictan) is an {{antidepressant}} and anxiolytic {{drug that}} {{was introduced by}} Solvay in France in 1982 {{for the treatment of}} depression but has since been discontinued. It is a prodrug of flumexadol (N-dealkyloxaflozane; 2-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)morpholine; CERM-1841 or 1841-CERM), which is reported to act as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A (pKi = 7.1) and 5-HT2C (pKi = 7.5) receptors and, to a much lesser extent, of the 5-HT2A (pKi = 6.0) receptor. In addition to its serotonergic properties, <b>oxaflozane</b> may also produce anticholinergic side effects at high doses, namely in overdose.|$|E
5000|$|Flumexadol (INN) (developmental {{code name}} CERM-1841 or 1841-CERM) {{is a drug}} {{described}} and researched as a non-opioid analgesic which was never marketed. It {{has been found to}} act as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A (pKi = 7.1) and 5-HT2C (pKi = 7.5) receptors and, to a much lesser extent, of the 5-HT2A (pKi = 6.0) receptor. According to Nilsson (2006) in a paper on 5-HT2C receptor agonists as potential anorectics, [...] "The (+)-enantiomer of this compound showed ... affinity for the 5-HT2C receptor (Ki) 25 nM) ... and was 40-fold selective over the 5-HT2A receptor in receptor binding studies. Curiously, the racemic version ..., also known as 1841 CERM, was originally reported to possess analgesic properties while no association with 5-HT2C receptor activity was mentioned." [...] It is implied that flumexadol might be employable as an anorectic in addition to analgesic. Though flumexadol itself has never been approved for medical use, <b>oxaflozane</b> (brand name Conflictan) is a prodrug of the compound that was formerly used clinically in France as an antidepressant and anxiolytic agent.|$|E
