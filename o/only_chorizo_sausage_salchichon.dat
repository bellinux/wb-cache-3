40|$|The {{effect of}} {{packaging}} treatments on {{the attributes of}} commercial fresh <b>chorizo</b> <b>sausages</b> during chilled storage was studied. Four different types of commercial packaging were tested, namely, overwrapping, vacuum packaging and modified atmosphere packaging using 20 %CO 2 / 80 %N 2 (CO 2 /N 2) or 30 %CO 2 / 70 % argon (CO 2 /Ar). Characteristics of product were evaluated through pH levels, microbial growth, biogenic amines (BAs) formation, and sensory analysis. The sausages had high levels of lactic acid bacteria and total viable counts, which increased slightly (P 0. 05) between lots. Except for spermidine and spermine, BA levels in the product were generally low. BA increased gradually over the storage period, but this trend could not be clearly related to microbial population levels. Overall acceptability decreased over the storage period, the highest scores (P< 0. 05) were recorded for the unopened packages of the lots CO 2 /N 2 and CO 2 /Ar. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
