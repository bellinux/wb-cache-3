40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{characterize}} practices {{related to}} observation care {{and to examine}} the current models of pediatric observation medicine in US children's hospitals. DESIGN: We utilized 2 web‐based surveys to examine observation care in the 42 hospitals participating in the Pediatric Health Information System database. We obtained information regarding the designation of <b>observation</b> <b>status,</b> including the criteria used to admit patients into observation. From hospitals reporting the use of <b>observation</b> <b>status,</b> we requested specific details relating to the structures of observation care and the processes of care for observation patients following emergency department treatment. RESULTS: A total of 37 hospitals responded to Survey 1, and 20 hospitals responded to Survey 2. Designated observation units were present in only 12 of 31 (39 %) hospitals that report observation patient data to the Pediatric Health Information System. <b>Observation</b> <b>status</b> was variably {{defined in terms of}} duration of treatment and prespecified criteria. Observation periods were limited to < 48 hours in 24 of 31 (77 %) hospitals. Hospitals reported that various standards were used by different payers to determine <b>observation</b> <b>status</b> reimbursement. Observation care was delivered in a variety of settings. Most hospitals indicated that there were no differences in the clinical care delivered to virtual <b>observation</b> <b>status</b> patients when compared with other inpatients. CONCLUSIONS: Observation is a variably applied patient status, defined differently by individual hospitals. Consistency in the designation of patients under <b>observation</b> <b>status</b> among hospitals and payers may be necessary to compare quality outcomes and costs, as well as optimize models of pediatric observation care.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: Accumulating {{evidence}} has shown {{increasing use of}} observation stays for patients presenting to emergency departments and requiring diagnostic evaluation or time-limited treatment plans, but critics suggest that this expansion arises from hospitals' concerns to maximize revenue and shifts costs to patients. Perspectives of physicians making decisions to admit, observe, or discharge have been absent from the debate. We examine the views of emergency physicians in the United States and England on observation stays, and what influences their decisions to use observation services. METHODS: We undertook in-depth, qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of physicians in 3 hospitals across the 2 countries and analyzed these using an approach based on the constant-comparison method.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Inpatient {{administrative}} datasets often exclude observation stays, as {{observation is}} considered to be outpatient care. The extent to which this status is applied to pediatric hospitalizations is not known. OBJECTIVE: To characterize trends in <b>observation</b> <b>status</b> code utilization and 1 ‐day stays among children admitted from the emergency department (ED), and to compare patient characteristics and outcomes associated with observation versus inpatient stays. DESIGN: Retrospective longitudinal analysis of the 2004 – 2009 Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS). SETTING: Sixteen US freestanding children's hospitals contributing outpatient and inpatient data to PHIS. PATIENTS: Admissions to observation or inpatient status following ED care in study hospitals. MEASUREMENTS: Proportions of observation and 1 ‐day stays among all admissions from the ED were calculated each year. Top ranking discharge diagnoses and outcomes of observation were determined. Patient characteristics, discharge diagnoses, and return visits were compared for observation and 1 ‐day stays. RESULTS: The proportion of short‐stays (including both observation and 1 ‐day stays) increased from 37 % to 41 % between 2004 and 2009. Since 2007, observation stays have outnumbered 1 ‐day stays. In 2009, more than half of admissions from the ED for 6 of the top 10 ranking discharge diagnoses were short‐stays. Fewer than 25 % of observation stays converted to inpatient status. Return visits and readmissions following observation were no more frequent than following 1 ‐day stays. CONCLUSIONS: Children admitted under <b>observation</b> <b>status</b> make up a substantial proportion of acute care hospitalizations. Analyses of inpatient administrative databases that exclude observation stays likely result in an underestimation of hospital resource utilization for children.

One such method {{is the idea of}} placing a patient in <b>observation</b> <b>status,</b> a place where the patient is still an outpatient but may spend nights in the hospital. The use of this new method is known to have significant and possibly unexpected financial impact on the patient while the provider is simultaneously reacting to reduce costs associated with having this outpatient occupy space for days.

This essay looks at the observation patient status as a new vehicle for the provision of healthcare while seeking to build understanding for the relevance of the patient experience surrounding the observation patient service line. A pilot which highlights the very real problems hospitals are facing is presented in the essay.

40|$|Background: Recent {{data are}} lacking {{about the number}} of {{patients}} with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) -induced angioedema who present to the emergency department (ED). Current management of the condition and clinical outcomes also are not known. Objective: To describe the clinical epidemiology of ACEI-induced angioedema in patients who present to the ED. Methods: We performed a medical record review of ACEI-induced angioedema in patients who presented to 5 EDs in the Emergency Medicine Network. A structured data abstraction form was used to collect each patient's demographic factors, medical history, and details about the angioedema that prompted the ED visit. The medical record review also focused on treatment provided in the ED and subsequent need for hospitalization. Results: We identified a total of 220 patients with ACEI-induced angioedema. The frequency of ACEI-induced angioedema among all patients with angioedema who presented to the ED was 30 % (95 % confidence interval, 26 %- 34 %). The annual rate of visits for ACEI-induced angioedema was 0. 7 per 10, 000 ED visits. The most frequent presenting signs were shortness of breath, lip and tongue swelling, and laryngeal edema. Most patients (58 %) were sent home directly from the ED, whereas 12 % were regular inpatient admissions, 11 % were admitted to the intensive care unit, and 18 % were admitted under <b>observation</b> <b>status</b> (< 24 hours). Pharyngeal swelling and respiratory distress were independent predictors of hospital admission and longer length of stay.

40|$|Objective: Many {{emergency}} department (ED) patients with cardiopulmonary {{symptoms such as}} chest pain or dyspnea are placed in observation units but do not undergo specific diagnostic testing for pulmonary embolism (PE). The role of observation units in the diagnosis of PE has not been studied. We hypothesized {{that there was a}} small but significant rate of unsuspected PE in our observation unit population. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review at an urban academic hospital of all ED patients with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis of PE between January 2005 and July 2006. The number of such patients assigned to observation at any point in their stay was recorded, in addition to events leading to diagnosis and subsequent in-hospital outcomes. Results: Thirteen of the 190 ED patients diagnosed with PE were placed in the observation unit. Six of these either had a known recent diagnosis of PE or had testing for PE initiated prior to placement in the observation unit. Two of the remaining seven patients with undiagnosed PE were placed in observation for undifferentiated chest pain, accounting for 0. 09 % of the 2190 patients under the chest pain protocol. Twelve of 13 PE patients (92 %) were admitted with an average stay of 4. 3 days. Of the 13 patients, five were ultimately determined after admission to not have PE, leaving a rate of confirmed PE in the observation unit population of 0. 12 % (8 / 6182), with five of eight being classified as unsuspected prior to assignment to observation (0. 08 % rate). Conclusion: We identified a small number of patients assigned to observation with unsuspected PE. The high rate of hospital admission and prolonged hospital stay suggests that patients with PE are inappropriate for <b>observation</b> <b>status.</b> Given the low incidence of unsuspected PE, there may be a need for a specific approach to screening for PE in observation unit patients.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{the use of}} paediatric “observation status” in the {{accident and emergency department}} (A&E). METHOD: A prospective survey was performed in 12 Belgian hospitals during 2 weeks straddling October and November 2010. All patients (< 16 years) attending A&E were included. “Observation status” was defined when after the first medical evaluation, instead of hospitalization or home discharge, the situation required further observation of the patient. The clinicians in charge were asked {{at the start of the}} “observation” period to prognosticate whether the child would be discharged or admitted. RESULTS: Among 3220 children included in the study, the observation rate was 38. 6 %. The characteristics of these children were as follows. Median age: 5. 0 years old (IQR: 1. 7 - 11. 3), boys: 53. 5 %. The median length of stay in A&E was 110 minutes (IQR: 65 - 175) and 14. 3 % were admitted as in-patient. The most common observations concerned orthopaedic, medical digestive and respiratory affections. The three main reasons for observation were additional procedures (69. 0 %), diagnostic determination (10. 7 %), and treatment testing (8. 3 %). Most of the observations (86. 9 %) were performed in a waiting room (not in a bed), 9. 7 % in an observation unit dedicated to children and 3. 4 % in an observation unit to adults. Only 4. 1 % of the observations satisfied the French paediatric short-stay definition (patient in a bed monitored hourly). Compared to the clinicians’ prognosticated rate, 1. 3 % less children were admitted as in-patients. CONCLUSION: Despite the absence of financial and regulatory frame in Belgium, observation is a frequent modality of care. Observation helped to refine diagnosis and treatments and to reduce in-patient admission rate. However, with regards to the French guidelines less than 5 % could be qualified as paediatric A&E short-stay. Flexible observation units should be recommended.

40|$|Because of {{the expense}} {{associated}} with hospital admissions, {{the use of}} <b>observation</b> <b>status</b> has grown. One of the most consistently measured outcomes in observation is the patient length of stay (LOS). Research supports the positive impact that nurse practitioners (NP) have on LOS when added to other service lines that {{could be applied to}} observation. Banner Desert Medical Center (BDMC) is currently attempting to decrease their observation LOS. Adding acute care nurse practitioners (ACNP) to the care delivery model is a potential intervention. The purpose of this project was to develop an executive summary to inform staff of current evidence that supports the addition of ACNPs to observation. Then, via a survey, the project aimed to determine the level of staff support by identifying the Transtheoretical Model of Change (TTM) Stage of Change and to recommend appropriate stage-matched interventions for staff based on TTM processes of change. The 10 Likert scale survey questions were adapted from two validated TTM surveys. The final question asked for {{the pros and cons of}} the intervention to determine the Decisional Balance (DB). The registered nurse (RN) cohort demonstrated consistently strong support for the proposed intervention with an average mean response of 6. 57 on affirmative questions and a correspondingly low average mean of 2. 2 on negative questions. When compared to the RN cohort, the physician cohort had lower mean responses with an average of 4. 29 on every affirmative, a higher average mean response of 3. 85 on the negatively worded questions. The DB for RNs was 19 pros to two cons. The DB for physicians was eight cons to three pros. These finding reflect that nurses are in the Preparation Stage of Change and are ready to move forward with adding ACNPs. An appropriate stage-matched intervention for registered nurses would be the development of change teams. In contrast, the physician cohort is in the Precontemplation stage and is not ready to proceed with adding ACNPs. Appropriate stage-matched interventions for physicians would include facilitating consciousness-raising activities such as an open forum to communicating information about the proposed change and to explore concerns and questions regarding the intervention...|$|E

The hypothesis of this study was that there has been an increase in observation charge code use over time and variations in the application of observation charge codes across hospital types. MethodsThis was a cross‐sectional analysis of 5  years (2007 through 2011) of administrative claims data from Michigan residents enrolled in Medicaid, Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Michigan preferred provider organization, and Blue Cross Network health maintenance organization compiled into a single data set. Emergency department (ED) visits to facilities in Michigan made by children (younger than 18  years) were selected. Observation‐prone ED visits were identified based on the presence of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD‐ 9 ‐CM) codes. Counts of observation‐prone ED visits were determined and descriptive statistics were calculated. Changes over time in the proportion of visits with observation charge codes by hospital type were assessed with chi‐square analysis. ResultsThe observation‐prone ICD‐ 9 ‐CM codes were identified in 881, 622 ED visits made by children to 142 Michigan facilities during the 5 ‐year study period. Overall, the vast majority of visits (n =  646, 499; 91. 0 %) with the selected ICD‐ 9 ‐CM codes resulted in discharge from the ED without associated observation or inpatient charge codes. Among the 64, 288 visits that resulted in admission for observation or inpatient care, observation charge codes without inpatient charge codes were applied to 22, 933 (35. 7 %) admissions, observation and inpatient charge codes were applied to 4, 756 (7. 4 %) admissions, and inpatient charge codes without observation charge codes were applied to 36, 599 (56. 9 %) admissions. Hospitals with pediatric ED and inpatient services (Type 1 and Type 2 hospitals) had higher proportions of ED visits that went on to admission for observation or inpatient care (15. 9 and 10. 7 %) than hospitals without pediatric ED services (Type 3 and Type 4 hospitals; 7. 2 and 3. 7 %). The proportion of admissions that had observation charge codes for all hospital types increased over time, most prominently among Type 1 and Type 2 hospitals. ConclusionsThe application of observation charge codes to Michigan children with observation‐prone conditions has increased over time across all hospital types. There is a need to evaluate pediatric observation care in diverse settings to compare the effectiveness of different models...|$|E

This Article focuses primarily on the specific criteria to be used in determining whether a patient 2 ̆ 7 s admission into a psychiatric hospital is voluntary. The questions it seeks to answer include: should psychiatrists be required to administer a mental status exam? Should witnesses be present at the time the person is voluntarily admitted and what, if any, documentation should be required? Should the mental disorder diagnosis of the patient be a major factor in determining competence to give voluntary consent? Should periodic review be required to determine whether the person continues to meet the criteria for voluntary admission? This Article will make specific recommendations as to when a psychiatric hospital will be permitted to accept and treat a mentally ill person as a voluntary patient and will ask what the legal significance is of the phrase 2 ̆ 2 knowingly and competently 2 ̆ 2 as used in defining consent to hospitalization. Related to its primary focus, this Article examines the process through which a mentally ill person is voluntarily confined to a psychiatric hospital. It reviews diagnostic methods in order to help identify the existence of patient coercion. It discusses the need for a waiting period before the time the hospital assigns patient status and the time a patient signs an admission form. It also discusses the relevance of the proximity between the time a patient signs the form and his initial confinement involuntary civil commitment hearing. In particular, the Article explores whether there are certain time periods during the initial <b>observation</b> <b>status</b> of a patient in which there {{is more likely to be}} stress, anxiety, misunderstanding, coercion, or clear understanding as to the significance of the voluntary status. A further aspect of the article is an exploration of the legal issues surrounding voluntary confinement. The questions addressed in this regard include: should a legal guardian or power of attorney be permitted to voluntarily admit a person into a psychiatric facility? What are the legal implications of an advanced medical directive or living will? Should an attorney be consulted by the patient prior to any voluntary admission, and should a judge review the voluntary admission to ensure that the patient is legally competent to be voluntarily admitted? What is the relevance of a prior court determination of the patient to being found legally incompetent? Voluntary psychiatric hospitalization should be the result of a competent and informed decision arrived at within a non-coercive environment. Hospitalization based on anything less is not only involuntary, but it is an infringement of personal liberty. Because of the uncertainties surrounding voluntary patient status-uncertainties exacerbated by the absence of due process protections-the criteria and procedures of voluntary admission demand careful and thorough scrutiny. By ensuring that voluntary admission is in fact voluntary, such scrutiny is the first step in protecting a mentally ill patient 2 ̆ 7 s personal liberty...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a simple method for nonparametric estimation of a distribution function {{based on current}} <b>status</b> data where <b>observations</b> of current <b>status</b> information are subject to misclassification. Nonparametric maximum likelihood techniques lead to use of a straightforward set of adjustments to the familiar pool-adjacent-violators estimator used when misclassification is assumed absent. The methods consider alternative misclassification models and are extended to regression models for the underlying survival time. The ideas are motivated by and applied to an example on human papilloma virus (HPV) infection status of a sample of women examined in San Francisco...|$|R
