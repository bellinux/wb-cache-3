Ventilation {{in the mines}} was controlled {{by a series of}} wooden doors across the passages, these children would sit in a niche dug <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> opening and closing these doors to allow miners and tubs to pass. It was common for them to sit in the dark for up to 8 hours a day. Other young children were employed as pony tenters, they would feed and water the pit ponies in the underground stables.|$|E

The middle figure and the two figures {{on each side of}} the door are raised by about half their height above the other figures.

Below the outer two Wise Virgins and the two Foolish Virgins, two faces peer <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> on each side. On the wise side, they represent the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon. On the foolish side, they represent Zephaniah and, maybe, Isaiah. In the center, between the two doors, is Justice flanked by two angels. Below Justice and the angels is a scroll commemorating the laying of the cornerstone in 1421.|$|E

500|$|Darshan is a Sanskrit word {{which means}} [...] "sight" [...] and [...] "beholding" [...] (also means: [...] "the viewing of an idol or a saint") which {{was adopted by}} Mughals for their daily {{appearance}} before their subjects. This also showed a Hindu influence, It was first practiced by Humayun before Akbar adopted it as a practice at sunrise. Jharokha is an easterly facing [...] "ornate bay-window", canopied, throne-balcony, the [...] "balcony for viewing" [...] (an oriel window projecting <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall)</b> provided in every palace or fort where the kings or emperors resided during their reign. Its architecture served not only the basic need for lighting and ventilation but also attained a divine concept {{during the reign of}} Mughals. The jharokha appearances by the Mughals have been depicted by many paintings.|$|E
500|$|... "Ron and Tammy" [...] {{was written}} by Mike Scully and {{directed}} by Troy Miller. The episode featured comedian and actress Megan Mullally in a guest appearance as Ron's ex-wife, Tammy. Mullally is the real-life wife of Nick Offerman, who plays Ron. Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur conceived {{the idea for the}} story, and asked Offerman whether he and Mullally would be opposed to her playing such a terrible character. Offerman was extremely responsive to the idea. Mullally said she enjoyed the script, particularly the dialogue of Ron describing Tammy, more than Tammy's part herself. Offerman and Mullally improvised many of their on-screen fights, as well as the varied methods of unusual kissing between the two characters. During the diner scene, in which Ron and Tammy switch between violent fighting and passionate kissing, Offerman accidentally pulled a diner table <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> after placing Mullally on top of it and kissing her. The scene was used in the final episode. Offerman said of filming the diner scenes, [...] "At the end of doing that for a few hours, we said, you know that feels like it was five weeks worth of really good therapy." ...|$|E
500|$|Finally in space, Homer reveals he has smuggled {{potato chips}} on board. He opens the bag, but is unaware that, {{due to the}} effects of weightlessness, they will spread around and clog the instruments. His {{appetite}} seems to save the day as he floats after the chips, eating them, but he manages to fly into an experimental ant farm, letting the ants loose in the shuttle. James Taylor comes in over the radio to sing [...] "You've Got a Friend", but the disaster continues on board as the ants destroy the navigation system. James Taylor suggests that they blow the bugs out the front hatch, which the astronauts do, but Homer fails to put on his harness and is nearly blown out of the open hatch before grabbing its handle and clinging for life. Buzz pulls him inside, but due to the vacuum's sheer force, Homer bends the hatch handle, preventing the door from closing and potentially resulting in the shuttle's destruction on re-entry. When Race declares he will attack Homer in frustration, Homer pulls a rod <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> to defend himself, and he inadvertently uses it to seal the door shut. With the problems solved, the shuttle successfully returns to Earth, making a convenient crash-landing through the roof of a press reporters' convention.|$|E

500|$|The {{architectural}} writer Geoffrey Tyack {{has written}} that Nuffield College was Oxford's [...] "most important architectural project of the immediate post-war years". Opinions about the architecture merits of the college have varied, although most have been unfavourable. The authors of a 1961 booklet on the architecture of modern Oxford {{said that it was}} [...] "Oxford's biggest monument to barren reaction". The Cotswold style was [...] "taken absurdly out of context and mercilessly stretched", and did not [...] "harmonise with the clumsy tower", whilst the spire [...] " [...] uneasily... despite its elaborate base". An unnamed journalist wrote in The Times in 1959 that the main buildings of the quadrangles were [...] "somewhat oddly wedded to small basins which irresistibly suggest a Lilliputian Versailles". The same writer said that the tower rose [...] "Manhattan-wise for 10 storeys through the twentieth century, only to have a diminutive spire, escaped from the fifteenth, push through its top to steal the last laugh". Peter Sager, too, thought that the [...] "high-rise library" [...] could [...] "easily stand on the Hudson". Sir Howard Colvin said that the [...] "utilitarian function" [...] of the tower [...] "accorded ill with its original ornamental purpose", and that the architects had [...] "failed to find a satisfactory solution" [...] to the [...] "repetitive uniformity of fenestration". [...] Of the fl√®che, Colvin said that it [...] "makes its contribution to the Oxford skyline without any overt reference to historical precedent". Geoffrey Tyack also disliked the tower, describing it as [...] "an ungainly structure" [...] that was [...] "lit by a monotonous array of windows punched <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> surface"; however, he thought the hall was [...] "an effective reinterpretation of the traditional collegiate pattern".|$|E

[...] In the interior of the church a quatrefoil shape was cut <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> through which she could receive the Eucharist and a squint (or hagioscope) for her use for prayer and reflection. [...] She left her cell and in 1332 she applied again and was granted permission to be re-enclosed.|$|E

He tried to calmly tell them how unhappy the police were with the assignment and its aftermath. [...] "We've got cops back there in ambulances who've been hit." [...] But the lull ended. Thirty to seventy protesters re-entered the park. A witness said the mob rammed a police barricade through the glass door of the Christodora House, a high-rise luxury building on Avenue B. They overturned planters and tore a lamp <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> threatened residents and staff with bodily harm, and screamed and chanted [...] "Die Yuppie Scum". At 6 a.m., the last protesters dispersed, vowing to demonstrate again.|$|E
