5|$|The {{special purpose}} {{entities}} {{were used for}} more than just circumventing accounting conventions. As a result of one violation, Enron's balance sheet understated its liabilities and overstated its equity, and its earnings were overstated.

However, investors were <b>oblivious</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that the special purpose entities were actually using the company's own stock and financial guarantees to finance these hedges.

5|$|The {{meeting at}} Aintree had been beset by {{problems}} before the race. Fifteen animal rights protesters invaded the course near the first fence (as had also {{happened at the}} 1991 Grand National) resulting in a delayed start. A first false start was caused by several riders becoming tangled in the starting tape. Starter Keith Brown, who was officiating his last National before retirement, waved his red recall flag and a second official, Ken Evans, who was situated 100 yards further down the track, in turn signalled to the leading runners to turn around. At the second attempt, the tape became tangled again — {{around the neck of}} jockey Richard Dunwoody — and Brown called another false start. However, this time his recall flag did not unfurl as he waved it. As a result, 30 of the 39 riders set off around the track, <b>oblivious</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> recall.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—L 7 -filter is a {{significant}} deep packet inspection (DPI) extension to Netfilter in Linux’s QoS framework. It classifies network traffic based on information hidden in the packet payload. Although the computationally intensive payload classification can be accelerated with multiple processors, the default OS scheduler is <b>oblivious</b> <b>to</b> both <b>the</b> software characteristics and the underlying multicore architecture. In this paper, we present a parallelized L 7 -filter algorithm and an efficient scheduler technique for multicore servers. Our multithreaded L 7 -filter algorithm can process the incoming packets on multiple servers boosting the throughput tremendously. Our scheduling algorithm is based on Highest Random Weight (HRW), which maintains the connection locality for the incoming traffic, but only guarantees load balance at the connection level. We present an Adapted Highest Random Weight (AHRW) algorithm that enhances HRW by applying packet-leve...|$|R
5|$|The {{painting}} {{contains the}} same white angular rails as the mid-grounds of his 1949 Head II, Head VI, and Study for Portrait {{of the same}} year.

The horizontal angular geometrical shape is sketched in white and grey in the mid-ground, and represents an early form of a spatial device Bacon was to develop and perfect during the 1950s, when it effectively became a cage used to frame the anguished figures portrayed in Bacon's foregrounds. In the mid-ground, the artist has sketched a street scene, which features walking stick figures and cars. The pedestrians appear <b>oblivious</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> slaughter before them.|$|E

5|$|Chatwin went to Australia {{to learn}} more about Aboriginal culture, {{specifically}} the songlines or dreaming tracks. Each songline is a personal story and functions as a creation tale and a map, and each Aboriginal Australian has their own songline. Chatwin thought the songlines could be a metaphor he could use to support his ideas about humans' need to wander, which he believed was genetic. However, he struggled to fully understand and describe the songlines and their place in Aboriginal culture. This was due to Chatwin's approach to learning about the songlines. He spent several weeks in 1983 and 1984 in Australia, during which he primarily relied on non-Aboriginal people for information. Chatwin was limited by his inability to speak the Aboriginal languages. He interviewed people involved in the Land Rights movement, and he alienated many of them because he was <b>oblivious</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> politics and also because he was an admirer of Strehlow's work.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a novel approach}} <b>to</b> reduce <b>the</b> impact of spoofing by a subtle change in the login process. At {{the heart of our}} contribution is the understanding that current anti-spoof technologies fail {{largely as a result of}} <b>the</b> difficulties <b>to</b> communicate security and risk to typical users. Accordingly, our solution is <b>oblivious</b> <b>to</b> whether <b>the</b> user was tricked by a fraudster or not. We achieve that by modifying the user login process, and letting the browser or operating system cause different results of user login requests, based on whether the site is trusted or not. Experimental results indicate that our new approach, which we dub “SpoofKiller”, will address approximately 80 % of spoofing attempts. Free licenses <b>to</b> <b>the</b> technology are offered by the organization owning it, and serious discussions with a major OS vendor have been initiated, with the goal of protecting payments made from apps running on their platform. ...|$|R
