40|$|Alkali-activated fly ash (AAFA) {{has been}} {{identified}} as a low-carbon alternative to Portland cement (PC). However, conventional thermal <b>oven</b> <b>curing,</b> typically at 85 oC, is commonly required to firstly initiate and then accelerate the chemical reaction, which may result in more energy consumption, offsetting the environmental benefits which could be obtained from AAFA. In this study, the potential of using microwave as an alternative low-energy thermal curing method for manufacturing AAFA has been explored. A microwave curing regime based on a control strategy using temperature feedback data was developed and evaluated in the manufacture of AAFA. The temperature profile within the AAFA sample produced under microwave curing was obtained by using an embedded optical fibre temperature sensor, which was thus used to adjust the microwave power in real-time in order to achieve a desired internal temperature. The AAFA samples manufactured by microwave curing were characterized using compressive strength, XRD, NMR, MIP and SEM, which were also compared with the samples from thermal <b>oven</b> <b>curing.</b> The results indicated that the AAFA manufactured with microwave curing not only showed an equivalent performance, similar reaction products and microstructure, but also showed dramatic reduction inenergy consumption...|$|E

40|$|Abstract]: To process composites, {{post-curing}} {{with heat}} is often required {{in order to}} achieve the desired heat distortion temperature (HDT). Post-curing the composites with conventional oven would often take 6 or 8 hours. However, if the composites are post-cured in a microwave oven, it only requires a few minutes. Hence, the aim of the project is to investigate the suitability of microwave for material processing. Epoxies are polyethers and they are widely used to produce coatings, structural adhesives because they have excellent adhesion and low cure shrinkage. Epoxies are also good dielectric and have been used to manufacture printed circuit boards (PCB). The main objectives of this project are: • To produce specimens with different percentage by weight of sawdust. • To measure the loss tangent and dielectric constant of the specimens. • To measure the tensile strength of the specimens. • To measure the glass transition temperature of the specimens • To consider both of the material costs and the test results to recommend the best specimens for different industrial applications. This report has found that the sawdust reinforced epoxy resins have higher Young’s modulus, higher dielectric constant but lower tensile strength and yield strength. The loss tangents of the sawdust reinforced epoxy resins were slightly higher than the loss tangents of pour epoxy resins. Hence, the sawdust reinforced epoxy resin is slightly more efficient to be post-cured in microwave than pure epoxy resin. This report has also found that <b>oven</b> <b>cured</b> epoxy resins have the lowest dielectric constant, the lowest loss tangent, and the highest glass transition temperature. Hence, <b>oven</b> <b>cured</b> epoxy resin is the best candidate for making PCBs...|$|R
