40|$|Conventional {{fracture}} {{data collection}} methods are usually implemented on planar surfaces or assuming they are planar; these methods may introduce sampling errors on uneven <b>outcrop</b> surfaces. Consequently, data collected on limited types of <b>outcrop</b> surfaces (mainly bedding surfaces) {{may not be a}} sufficient representation of fracture network characteristic in <b>outcrops.</b> Recent development of techniques that obtain DOMs from <b>outcrops</b> and extract the full extent of individual fractures offers the opportunity {{to address the problem of}} performing the conventional sampling methods on uneven <b>outcrop</b> surfaces. In this study, we propose a new method that performs <b>outcrop</b> fracture characterization on suppositional planes cutting through DOMs. The suppositional plane is the best fit plane of the <b>outcrop</b> surface, and the fracture trace map is extracted on the suppositional plane so that the fracture network can be further characterized. The amount of sampling errors introduced by the conventional methods and avoided by the new method on 16 uneven <b>outcrop</b> surfaces with different roughnesses are estimated. The results show that the conventional sampling methods don't apply to <b>outcrops</b> other than bedding surfaces or <b>outcrops</b> whose roughness > 0. 04 m, and that the proposed method can greatly extend the types of <b>outcrop</b> surfaces for <b>outcrop</b> fracture characterization with the suppositional plane cutting through DOMs. Comment: Research article, 18 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates three bedrock {{exposures}} at Erebus crater, an 300 m diameter crater approximately 4 km {{south of}} Endurance crater on Mars. These <b>outcrops,</b> called Olympia, Payson, and Yavapai, provide additional {{evidence in support}} of the dune–interdune model proposed for the formation of the deposits at the Opportunity landing site in Meridiani Planum. There is evidence for greater involvement of liquid water in the Olympia <b>outcrop</b> exposures than was observed in Eagle or Endurance craters. The Olympia <b>outcrop</b> likely formed in a wet interdune and sand sheet environment. The facies observed within the Payson <b>outcrop,</b> which is likely stratigraphically above the Olympia <b>outcrop,</b> indicate that it was deposited in a damp-wet interdune, sand sheet, and eolian dune environment. The Yavapai <b>outcrop,</b> which likely stratigraphically overlies the Payson <b>outcrop,</b> indicates that it was deposited in primarily a sand sheet environment and also potentially in an eolian dune environment. These three <b>outcrop</b> exposures may indicate an overall drying-upward trend spanning the stratigraphic section from its base at the Olympia <b>outcrop</b> to its top at the Yavapai <b>outcrop.</b> This contrasts with the wetting-upward trend seen in Endurance and Eagle craters. Thus, the series of <b>outcrops</b> seen at Meridiani by Opportunity may constitute a full climatic cycle, evolving from dry to wet to dry conditions. ...|$|R
40|$|Habitat {{disturbance}} poses a {{major threat}} to biodiversity worldwide. The broad-headed snake (Hoplocephalus bungaroides) has become Australia 2 ̆ 7 s most endangered snake due to a dependence on rock habitats that are subject to high rates of human-induced degradation. The permanence of degradation can only be reversed by <b>outcrop</b> restoration. We constructed experimental <b>outcrops</b> near (3 ̆c 150 [*]m) and far (3 ̆e 500 [*]m) from roads and walking trails (access points). We tested two hypotheses over a 14 -year period: that <b>outcrop</b> restoration can restore habitat quality, and that the frequency of <b>outcrop</b> degradation is influenced by distance from access points. We confirmed that habitat value was restored: lizard prey of the broad-headed snake was more abundant in constructed compared to natural outcrops; broad-headed snakes were detected equally in constructed and natural <b>outcrops.</b> Disturbance to constructed <b>outcrops</b> occurred more often and was more severe at near compared to far <b>outcrops.</b> The probability of occupancy by broad-headed snakes was 0. 75 [*]±[*] 0. 13 in 29 far <b>outcrops</b> compared to 0. 41 [*]±[*] 0. 11 in 35 near <b>outcrops,</b> suggesting a response to disturbance and more frequent poaching at near <b>outcrops.</b> Habitat restoration for the broad-headed snake should have its greatest value at locations far from access points. Restricting access should be a principal strategy to manage rock <b>outcrop</b> ecosystems. <b>Outcrop</b> disturbance is not unique to Australia. These findings have relevance to management of rock <b>outcrops</b> worldwide. Habitat restoration is an expensive conservation tool for endangered species, particularly if unsuccessful.

5|$|John Kadlec, a {{consulting}} engineer {{on the original}} construction, has testified that he raised concerns at the time about sloppy workmanship and inadequate construction materials at the site, including structural columns that were already crooked, steel beams that were already rusting despite being new, and the ultimately fateful decision to place the complex's parking area on the roof.

40|$|Protected {{areas are}} {{commonly}} viewed as safe havens for endangered species. To test this notion, we experimentally constructed small rock <b>outcrops</b> for the endangered broad-headed snake (Hoplocephalus bungaroides) within {{a national park}} near Sydney, Australia. Rock <b>outcrops</b> provide vital shelter sites during the cooler months of the year. Constructed rock <b>outcrops</b> (3 × 5 m) were placed at 11 paired sites located near (≤ 250 m) and far from (3 ̆e 400 m) walking tracks and roads. Eight of our 22 rock <b>outcrops</b> were disturbed by people over a 15 -month period. Disturbance consisted of displacement of some rocks or complete destruction of the <b>outcrop.</b> Disturbed <b>outcrops</b> occurred up to 450 m from a walking track or road. Disturbance to natural <b>outcrops</b> has also been observed in this park. This demonstrates a continuing decline {{in the quality of}} this snake 2 ̆ 7 s habitat. Twenty of our rock <b>outcrops</b> were colonized by velvet geckos (Oedura lesueurii), the primary prey of this snake. One broad-headed snake was found in one <b>outcrop.</b> According to these findings, attempts to restore the habitat of this endangered snake should be centered on sites located ≥ 500 m from a walking track or road.

40|$|Aim Granite <b>outcrops</b> are {{prominent}} {{throughout the world}} and harbour many endemic species. Their topographic complexity and range of environments {{have led to the}} hypothesis that they act as refugia facilitating the persistence of species through climate change. We evaluate this hypothesis by investigating the phylogeographic patterns in a common granite endemic shrub. Location Granite <b>outcrops</b> of the Southwest Australian Floristic Region. Methods Chloroplast haplotypes of 89 Kunzea pulchella individuals from 16 granite <b>outcrops</b> were determined from sequences of three chloroplast intergenic spacer regions. Phylogenetic reconstruction and divergence dating was inferred using Bayesian and Parsimony analyses and phylogenetic relationships between haplotypes were examined in relation to geographic distributions. Nuclear diversity and differentiation of populations were assessed through analysis of 11 nuclear microsatellite loci across 384 individuals from the 16 granite <b>outcrops.</b> Results Kunzea pulchella exhibited low haplotype and allelic diversity within <b>outcrops</b> and high levels of divergence among <b>outcrops,</b> indicating an ancient restriction to specific <b>outcrops</b> with genetic drift as the main driver of evolution. Two divergent lineages were revealed in the chloroplast phylogeny dating to the Pliocene and potentially reflecting the initial impact of increased aridity prior to isolation on individual <b>outcrops.</b> Main conclusions Rather than uncovering the typical pattern for Pleistocene refugia with contraction to, and expansion from particular granite <b>outcrops,</b> we observed persistence, prolonged isolation and divergence of populations. We suggest the persistence of K. pulchella on multiple <b>outcrops</b> through a period of considerable climatic change may be a result of broad climatic tolerances or contraction and expansion dynamics operating at microrefugial scales within <b>outcrops.</b> Our observations of low haplotype and allelic diversity within populations of K. pulchella provide some support for the latter. The enduring nature of K. pulchella and evolutionary potential of populations on individual <b>outcrops</b> accentuates the value of these environments for biodiversity conservation planning in a changing climate...|$|R

5|$|Faced {{with the}} {{prospect}} of French intervention, the British sought to concentrate their land and naval forces in one location, New York City. In May 1778, the British began to evacuate Philadelphia. On 18 May, Washington dispatched Lafayette with a 2,200-man force to reconnoiter near Barren Hill, Pennsylvania. The next day, the British heard that Lafayette had made camp nearby and sent 5,000men to trap and capture him. On 20 May, General Howe led a further 6,000soldiers and ordered an attack on his left flank. The flank scattered, and Lafayette organized a retreat while the British remained indecisive. To feign numerical superiority, Lafayette ordered men to appear from the woods on an <b>outcropping</b> (now Lafayette Hill) and to fire upon the British periodically.

40|$|Bushy-tailed woodrats (Neotoma cinerea) are nocturnal rodents {{that are}} usually {{confined}} to discrete rock <b>outcrops.</b> Several females may bred on one <b>outcrop,</b> {{and are expected to}} compete for limited resources. I monitored individual reproductive output of female woodrats on 22 <b>outcrops</b> in the Kananaskis Valley in Alberta during the breeding seasons from 1987 to 1989 to investigate the influence of competition among females on reproductive success.;My aims were two-fold. First, I tested the hypothesis that competition among females on <b>outcrops</b> reduces reproductive success in yearling females. I reduced densities of breeding females by approximately 50 % on 11 <b>outcrops</b> at the initiation of the three breeding seasons, and compared reproductive success of yearlings breeding on experimental and unmanipulated (N = 11) <b>outcrops.</b> Relative to yearlings on control <b>outcrops,</b> those on removal <b>outcrops</b> raised more offspring to weaning, their female offspring exhibited faster post-weaning growth, and they and their daughters tended to exhibit higher annual survival. Among females that were known to have bred in one year only, those on removal <b>outcrops</b> produced more offspring to weaning and more daughters to breeding (in their lifetime) than did those on control <b>outcrops.</b> I conclude that yearling bushy-tailed woodrats experience significant socially-mediated fitness costs.;My second goal was to investigate the influence of mother-offspring relationships on space use, behaviour, and reproductive success. Adult mothers and yearling daughters that bred simultaneously on their natal <b>outcrops</b> were closely associated in space throughout the breeding season. Behavioural interactions between mothers and daughters were amicable, while those between adult females and non-kin were strongly agonistic. This behavioural asymmetry was maintained when all females were reproductively active. Matrilineal females (those that shared an <b>outcrop</b> with their mother) experienced enhanced survival over their first winter, and raised more offspring to weaning than did non-matrilineal females. I suggest that adult mothers provide their daughters with access to critical resources (e. g., den sites), and provide a protective environment against aggressive conspecifics.;Woodrat sociality appears to be characterized by (1) competitive interactions among non-kin, and (2) cohesive, beneficial relationships among mothers and daughters...|$|R
