5|$|From {{his later}} {{marriage}} to Matasuntha, {{he had a}} son, also called Germanus, born posthumously (late 550/early 551). Nothing further is known <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> certainty, although he can possibly be identified with the patricius Germanus, a leading senator in the reign of Emperor Maurice (r. 582–602) whose daughter married Maurice's eldest son Theodosius. Michael Whitby identifies the younger Germanus with Germanus, a son-in-law of Tiberius II Constantine and Ino Anastasia.|$|E

5|$|After Marge leaves Bart with Nelson, Bart discovers two {{eggs in a}} bird's nest. Since he {{does not}} want the babies to die like their mother, he decides to hatch the eggs, and {{secretly}} keeps the eggs warm in his treehouse. After Bart spends more time in his treehouse, Marge starts to suspect he is up to something. After Marge finds out what Bart has been doing, she tells him she is proud <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> <b>With</b> Marge's help, the eggs eventually hatch, but the Simpson family is shocked when instead of birds, a pair of lizards emerge from the eggs, whom Bart names Chirpy Boy and Bart Jr.|$|E

5|$|After {{visiting the}} village of Annisa to see his dying sister Macrina, he {{returned}} to Nyssa in August. In 380 he travelled to Sebaste, {{in the province of}} Armenia Prima, to support a pro-Nicene candidate for the election to the bishopric. To his surprise, he himself was elected to the seat, perhaps due to the population's association <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> his brother. However, Gregory deeply disliked the relatively unhellenized society of Armenia, and he was confronted by an investigation into his orthodoxy by local opponents of the Nicene theology. After a stay of several months, a substitute was found - possibly Gregory's brother Peter, who was bishop of Sebaste from 381 - and Gregory returned home to Nyssa to write books I and II of Against Eunomius.|$|E
5|$|Betances openly hated Estrada when {{he first}} met him in the late 1870s, but grew more {{tolerant}} <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> time, and even defended Estrada's actions as leader when he assumed control of the Cuban Revolutionary Party. The Puerto Rican affiliates to the Party viewed Estrada's leadership with great skepticism, since Estrada sympathized {{with the idea of}} having the United States intervene in the Cuban independence war to have the Spanish evicted from Cuba. They suspected that his weak leadership allowed opportunists to profit from an invasion and even suggest that the United States keep Puerto Rico in exchange for independence for Cuba. Some written evidence points to the truth of their affirmations, at least to the extent of wanting to have the Puerto Rican section of the Cuban Revolutionary Party shut down, which eventually did happen.|$|E
5|$|Gilchrist's attacking batting {{has been}} {{a key part of}} Australia's one-day success, as he usually opened the batting. He {{was a part of the}} {{successful}} 1999, 2003 and 2007 Cricket World Cup campaigns. Gilchrist's Test batting average in the upper 40s is unusually high for a wicket-keeper. He is currently 45th on the all–time list of highest batting averages. He maintains a Test strike-rate of 82 runs per hundred balls, the highest since balls were recorded in full. His combination of attack and consistency create one of the most dynamic world cricketers ever, playing shots to all areas of the field with uncommon timing. He is second on the all-time list of most sixes in Tests at 100 with only Brendon McCullum ahead <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> 107. Gilchrist's skills as a wicket-keeper are sometimes questioned; some people claim that he is the best keeper in Australia whilst others claim that Victorian wicket-keeper Darren Berry is the best Australian wicket-keeper of the 1990s and early 2000s.|$|E

5|$|In Sandoz's apartment, Mulder and Scully find {{a picture}} <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> Albert Hosteen; they also find Merkmallen's dismembered {{body in a}} trash bag. The agents report to Skinner, with Mulder believing that Sandoz is being framed and that the {{artifact}} emits galactic radiation. He also seems to know that someone else is involved on the case, but Skinner remains silent. However, after the agents leave, Skinner hands a video tape of their conversation to Alex Krycek, who later provides it to Barnes. Scully travels to New Mexico and discovers that Hosteen is dying of cancer; Scully runs into Sandoz and corners him. Sandoz claims that Albert was helping him translate the artifacts, which had included passages from the Bible. Meanwhile, Mulder goes to the university to tail Barnes, but is overcome by his headache and passes out in the stairwell.|$|E
5|$|Making his Summer Olympics debut, Yazaldes Nascimento {{qualified}} for the 2004 Athens Games as a wildcard, without competing in any notable sporting event. He competed on 21 August in Heat 1 against seven other athletes. He ran a time of 11.00 seconds, finishing last of the eight athletes competing. Singapore's Poh Seng Song placed ahead <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> a time of 10.75 seconds, in a heat led by Namibia's Frank Fredericks who posted a time of 10.12 seconds, 0.88 seconds quicker than Nascimento's time. Out of 84 athletes, Nascimento ranked 67th and was 0.65 seconds behind the slowest athlete that progressed to the quarter-finals. Therefore, {{that was the end}} of his competition.|$|E
5|$|Susanna's second husband—Jamshed Singh Rathod (John Abraham), who renames himself Jimmy Stetson {{after their}} {{marriage}}—is a singer whose flaw is pride. The marriage begins well, but Jimmy becomes successful and misuses his new-found fame. He steals songs, dallies {{with other women}} and becomes dependent on drugs. Susanna wants to be lucky in love the second time; she tries to wean him from his addiction, but he continues in secret. She gives up, disposing <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> a heroin overdose. Police investigators find footprints near his body indicating that a person with six toes is the murderer.|$|E

5|$|The oldest part of {{the temple}} was built in 652 by Songtsen Gampo. To find a {{location}} for the temple, the king reportedly tossed his hat (a ring in another version) ahead <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> a promise to build a temple where the hat landed. It landed in a lake, where a white stupa (memorial monument) suddenly emerged over which the temple was built. In another version of the legend, Queen Bhrikuti founded the temple to install the statue she had brought and Queen Wencheng selected the site according to Chinese geomancy and feng shui. The lake was filled, leaving a small pond now visible as a well fed by the ancient lake, and a temple {{was built on the}} filled area. Over the next nine centuries, the temple was enlarged; its last renovation was carried out in 1610 by the Fifth Dalai Lama.|$|E
5|$|A {{short time}} later, Luke escapes again by using string to shake a bush and {{distract}} the guards, visiting a nearby {{house where he}} uses an axe to remove his shackles. To keep the guard dogs from following his scent, he spreads curry powder and chili powder across the ground to send them into sneezing fits and overload their sensitive sense of smell. While free, Luke mails Dragline a magazine that includes a photograph <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> two beautiful women. He is soon recaptured, beaten, returned to the prison camp, and fitted with two sets of leg irons. Luke is warned by the Captain that if he ever attempts to escape again, he will be killed on the spot. Luke is now annoyed by the other prisoners fawning over the magazine photo and reveals {{it to be a}} fake. At first, the other prisoners are angry, but after a long stay in the box, when Luke is forced to eat a huge serving of rice, they come to help him finish it.|$|E
5|$|From May 1980 {{to early}} 1981 he acted as {{editor for the}} {{magazine}} POL. In 1982, {{he moved to the}} neighbouring state of Victoria, and was appointed the Director of Tourism. This sparked an outcry in South Australia due to the two states' traditional rivalry. For his part, Dunstan said that he had yearned to be given a role in shaping and building the future of his native state, but that he had been snubbed for three years. He said that public figures in South Australia had told him that his high profile and ability to overshadow others could have caused a loss of face to them, and thus his departure would be seen favourably by them, while Victoria's offer gave him an opportunity to be constructive. Dunstan was appointed to the Victorian Economic Development Corporation on 12 July 1983, resigning on 23 June 1986. Dunstan stayed in the Director of Tourism role until 1986, when he returned to Adelaide after falling out with the government of John Cain. His retirement from these positions followed the provocative publication of a photograph <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> Monsignor Porcamadonna, member of the gay community Order of Perpetual Indulgence, taken after he had launched a collection of coming out stories by gay historian Gary Wotherspoon.|$|E

5|$|In May 2005, {{while still}} {{a member of}} the under-21 team, Carson was called up to the England senior team squad for the team's tour of the United States later that month. A year later, he came on as {{substitute}} for Robert Green, who had suffered a serious injury, in the England B international friendly against Belarus in May 2006. The injury to Green, who had been named in the England squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, led to Carson, who was on standby, being promoted to the England squad for the tournament, although he did not make any appearances. Carson continued to be selected for the England senior team squad, and in May 2007, made his second appearance for the England B team in a 3–1 win over Albania. Following the 2007 UEFA Under-21 Championships, he made his full England debut in a friendly against Austria in November 2007 when he kept a clean sheet. A week later, he made his competitive debut in a crucial match against Croatia, which England lost 3–2, resulting in their failure to qualify for UEFA Euro 2008. Carson was held particularly culpable for the first goal, when Niko Kranjčar's speculative shot from 30 yards dipped and bounced in front <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> <b>with</b> Carson only succeeding in parrying the ball into the net. England coach Steve McClaren was sacked the next day, as commentators criticised McClaren for selecting an inexperienced goalkeeper for the match.|$|E
5|$|Lauren Fenmore Baldwin (Tracey E. Bregman) {{gave birth}} to Fenmore prematurely, and {{he was forced to}} remain in the {{hospital}} for a short time. Shortly after his birth, he was kidnapped, along with Phyllis Summers Newman (Michelle Stafford) and her daughter, Summer Newman, by Sheila Carter, who had had cosmetic surgery to look like Phyllis. All are rescued when Lauren tracked down Sheila and shot her. In 2012, Fenmore was sent to stay with his half-brother, Scotty Grainger, in Canada due to Lauren's fear that Daisy Carter (Yvonne Zima), Sheila's daughter, would end up harming him. Months later, Fenmore returns a moody teenager, kindling a friendship with a teenaged Summer. They became close and later began a relationship. When Summer began harassing a boy named Jamie Vernon (Daniel Polo) online, Fenmore was against the idea, but when his father, Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc), began looking out for Jamie, he became jealous and took over the bullying by sending him harassing text messages from a disposable cell phone. Fenmore's jealously continued when Michael and Lauren had Jamie move in with them temporarily. He attempted to frame Jamie for stealing his mother's expensive decoration, and attempted to take pictures <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> the decoration on a rooftop. The boys struggled and Jamie was found face down in the snow below. He accused Fenmore of pushing him, Michael believed Jamie over his own son and he was arrested. However, Jamie later confessed that Fenmore did not push him and he was exonerated. Michael and Lauren's marriage suffered due to the bullying ordeal.|$|E
