40|$|Society {{today is}} {{increasingly}} {{exposed to the}} effects of emergencies. These situations not only affect the normal functioning of the society but also the functioning of <b>medical</b> <b>facilities.</b> The preparedness of <b>medical</b> <b>facilities</b> is a very important factor influencing the success in dealing with emergencies and crisis situations. The preparedness {{of the health care system}} as a whole consists of all <b>medical</b> <b>facilities</b> in the Czech Republic. Therefore, it is desirable that they are prepared to address them. The objective of the thesis, in its theoretical part, was to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of crisis preparedness in <b>medical</b> <b>facilities.</b> The practical part was intended to introduce in more detail the territory of the South Moravian Region and its issues and to map out emergency preparedness in the specified research set. The research set included <b>medical</b> <b>facilities</b> in the region that are not university hospitals but that are part of the region traumatology plan. The data on this issue was collected using a questionnaire. The questionnaire was in a format of selected work indicators of emergency preparedness and it was uniform for all the respondents. The work indicators were as follows: theoretical preparedness, organizational preparedness and practical preparedness. Based on the questionnaire survey, analysis of the results and determining the average level of preparedness of all the participating <b>medical</b> <b>facilities,</b> it was concluded that the preparedness of the <b>medical</b> <b>facilities</b> of a non-university type in the South Moravian Region is very diverse: from hospitals whose preparedness is excellent to those who do not reach the required basis. In the overall assessment, 40. 0 % of the respondents did not reach the determined average. Overall, the level of preparedness of the research set can be seen as slightly below average. To increase the level of preparedness of non-university <b>medical</b> <b>facilities,</b> it is suggested, for example, to create unified procedures for processing various types of plans, to assign each <b>medical</b> <b>facility</b> the obligation to employ a professional emergency manager, and to establish cooperation among individual <b>medical</b> <b>facilities...</b>|$|R

40|$|In a paper {{published}} in Management Science in 1982, George Moore and Charles ReVelle proposed a location model for siting a hierarchical system of <b>medical</b> <b>facilities.</b> In this paper we apply the Moore and ReVelle Hierarchical Maximal Covering Model {{to the location}} of <b>medical</b> <b>facilities</b> in the Kohat district in Pakistan. Optimal solutions of the Moore and ReVelle model are compared against the actual location of <b>medical</b> <b>facilities</b> in this district. We then extend the Moore and ReVelle formulation to include fixed and variable costs for siting and operating the facilities. We compare the solutions of that formulation with the results of the original Moore and ReVelle model. Facility siting Hierarchical Maximal Covering Models <b>Medical</b> <b>facilities...</b>|$|R
