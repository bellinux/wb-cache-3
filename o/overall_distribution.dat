Developing a coherent distribution plan is a central component of strategic planning. At the strategic level, there are three broad approaches to distribution, namely mass, selective or exclusive distribution. The number and type of intermediaries selected largely depends on the strategic approach. The <b>overall</b> <b>distribution</b> channel should add value to the consumer.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{terrestrial}} planets and dwarf planets (and likewise the larger satellites, like the Moon and Io) have irregular surfaces, this definition evidently has some flexibility, but a specific means of quantifying an object's shape by this standard {{has not yet}} been announced. Local irregularities may be consistent with global equilibrium. For example, the massive base of the tallest mountain on Earth, Mauna Kea, has deformed and depressed the level of the surrounding crust, so that the <b>overall</b> <b>distribution</b> of mass approaches equilibrium. The amount of leeway afforded the definition could affect the classification of the asteroid Vesta, which may have solidified while in hydrostatic equilibrium but was subsequently significantly deformed by large impacts (now 572.6×557.2×446.4km).|$|E
25|$|Since about 1800 in England and Wales {{and in the}} U.S., the {{popularity}} distribution of given names has been shifting so that the most popular names are losing popularity. For example, in England and Wales, the most popular female and male names given to babies born in 1800 were Mary and John, with 24% of female babies and 22% of male babies receiving those names, respectively. In contrast, the corresponding statistics for in England and Wales in 1994 were Emily and James, with 3% and 4% of names, respectively. Not only have Mary and John gone out of favour in the English speaking world, also the <b>overall</b> <b>distribution</b> of names has changed significantly over the last 100years for females, but not for males.

25|$|On {{the issue}} of whether most Americans do not stay put in any one income bracket, Krugman quotes from 2011 CBO {{distribution}} of income study Household income measured over a multi-year period is more equally distributed than income measured over one year, although only modestly so. Given the fairly substantial movement of households across income groups over time, it might seem that income measured {{over a number of years}} should be significantly more equally distributed than income measured over one year. However, much of the movement of households involves changes in income that are large enough to push households into different income groups but not large enough to greatly affect the <b>overall</b> <b>distribution</b> of income. Multi-year income measures also show the same pattern of increasing inequality over time as is observed in annual measures.|$|E
25|$|Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do {{not occur}} {{homogeneously}} across the human genome. In fact, there is enormous diversity in SNP frequency between genes, reflecting different selective pressures on each gene as well as different mutation and recombination rates across the genome. However, studies on SNPs are biased towards coding regions, the data generated from them are unlikely to reflect the <b>overall</b> <b>distribution</b> of SNPs throughout the genome. Therefore, the SNP Consortium protocol was designed to identify SNPs with no bias towards coding regions and the Consortium's 100,000 SNPs generally reflect sequence diversity across the human chromosomes.The SNP Consortium aims to expand the number of SNPs identified across the genome to 300 000 {{by the end of}} the first quarter of 2001. Changes in non-coding sequence and synonymous changes in coding sequence are generally more common than non-synonymous changes, reflecting greater selective pressure reducing diversity at positions dictating amino acid identity. Transitional changes are more common than transversions, with CpG dinucleotides showing the highest mutation rate, presumably due to deamination.|$|E
2500|$|The British Geological Survey {{reported}} {{the amount and}} distribution of PAH compounds including parent and alkylated forms in urban soils at 76 locations in Greater London, UK. The study showed that parent (16 PAH) content ranged from 4 to 67mg/kg (dry wt soil) and an average PAH concentration of 18mg/kg (dry wt soil) whereas the total PAH content (33 PAH) ranged from 6 to 88mg/kg and fluoranthene and pyrene were generally the most abundant PAH. Benzopyrene (BaP) the most toxic of the parent PAH is widely considered a key marker PAH for environmental assessments; the [...] normal background concentration of BaP in the London urban sites was 6.9mg/kg (dry wt soils). London soils contained more stable 4-6 ring PAH which were indicative of combustion/pyrolytic sources such as coal/oil burning and traffic sourced particulates. However, the <b>overall</b> <b>distribution</b> also suggested that the PAHs in London soils had undergone weathering and been modified {{by a variety of}} pre-and post-depositional processes such as volatilization and microbial biodegradation.|$|E

This study sought to examine how the updated SIRs varied from the previous SIRs calculated using older baselines for acute care hospital 0 HAIs. MethodsWe analyzed NHSN data for healthcare facility-onset laboratory-identified Clostridium difficile [CDI] and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA] bacteremia reported {{in accordance with the}} CMS 2 ̆ 019 inpatient quality reporting program requirement. The unit of analysis was CMS certification number (CCN) facility reporting in 2015. We compared <b>overall</b> <b>distributions</b> of CCN-level SIRs (CCN-SIRs) between new risk-adjustment models using a 2015 baseline (SIR_NEW) and old models using a 2011 baseline (SIR_OLD) and tested location shift (median away from null) of pairwise differences. We also examined the magnitude of shift in SIR from old to new baseline. ResultsFor each HAI, the national pooled mean SIR of the new baseline was 1. 0. For CDI, the <b>overall</b> <b>distributions</b> of CCN SIR_NEW and CCN-SIR_OLD were different, and the median of pairwise difference was away from null with CCN-SIR_NEW slightly higher.

40|$|Background: A recent {{genome-wide}} linkage study mapped {{blood pressure}} (BP) -related loci on human chromosome 1 q and identified the regulator of G-protein signaling 5 (RGS 5) {{as a candidate}} for regulation of BP. Thus, we assessed the relationship between RGS 5 genetic polymorphisms and essential hypertension (EH) in Chinese. Methods: A total of 906 patients with EH and 894 age- and gender-matched normotensive (NT) controls were enrolled. Sixteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in RGS 5 were genotyped. Results: There {{were no significant differences in}} the <b>overall</b> <b>distributions</b> of the genotypic and allelic frequencies for each SNPs between the two groups. However, in haplotype analysis, significant differences for the <b>overall</b> <b>distributions</b> were noted for four haplotypes constructed by five SNPs (rs 12041294 C/T, rs 10917690 A/G, rs 10917695 T/C, rs 10917696 T/C and rs 2662774 G/A), viz. H 2 (C–A–C–T–A) (p= 0. 038), H 5 (C–G–T–T–G) (p= 0. 001), H 6 (T–G–C–T–A) (p= 0. 021) and H 12 (T–A–T–T–G) (p= 0. 023). Serum concentrations of high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol showed significant associations with haplotypes revealed by a global test (p= 0. 0001 and 0. 0309). Conclusions: Multiple SNPs in combination in RGS 5 may confer risk for hypertension. Our results also lend support for the effect of RGS 5 SNPs on lipid metabolism. Further studies are warranted to find the causal SNPs in RGS 5 for EH. Clin Chem Lab Med 2009; 47 : 1483 – 8. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
