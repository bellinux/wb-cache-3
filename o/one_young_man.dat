5|$|<b>One</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> {{kicked and}} smashed {{the window of}} a police car, lit a pack of matches, and set the {{upholstery}} on fire. After burning for a short time, the fuel tank exploded; a dozen more police cars and eight other automobiles would be destroyed in a similar fashion. The photo on the front cover of the Dead Kennedys 1980 album Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables, which shows several police cars on fire, was taken that night. Several crowd members threw tear gas, which they had stolen from police vehicles. Riots began to break out, with one mob disrupting traffic. Electric trollies were disabled when their overhead wires were pulled down, and violence broke out against the police officers, who were outnumbered. Police Chief Charles Gain, standing inside City Hall, ordered officers not to attack and to simply stand their ground.|$|E
5|$|Several years prior, one of {{the most}} {{powerful}} men in the small island nation of Horai, Tenro Horai, discovered an incredible magical power deep within the ground that gave him god-like strength, the Ubusunagami Okinokai. Tenro and his followers used this power to conquer other nations. A rebel federation called Tenkaku emerged to challenge the Horai. They fought to free the world of Horai's conquests, but lost battle after battle. Eventually they were almost completely wiped out, except <b>one</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> survived named Shinra. Shinra set off to battle Horai again, but he was shot down and crashed in a remote village called Ikaruga. The village was inhabited by people exiled due to the Horai expansion.The village inhabitants saved Shinra from the plane wreckage and nursed him back to health. After healing, Shinra stated that he was still determined to continue the battle against Horai. The villagers entrusted him with a fighter plane they had built themselves called the Ikaruga. The ship was specially designed and hidden away in a secret underground location beneath the village. It was the first ship built to utilize and switch between two energy polarities, black and white.|$|E

25|$|Into {{the early}} decades of the twentieth century Vietnam, young men and women used the festival as a chance to meet future life companions.

25|$|Our true {{academic}} mission — to liberally educate {{each and}} every student — is a timeless reminder of the lives we change here at Wabash College, <b>one</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> at a time.

These profound gifts — the ability to act, to see, and to speak — are the bedrock that underpin teaching and learning at Wabash College.|$|E
25|$|The {{house at}} Avenida 3 Ote 201 {{in the city}} of Puebla belonged to Pedro de Carvajal, who was a wealthy and {{respected}} man. However, he lost his young wife as she gave birth to their second child, a boy. When his daughter turned 15, there were many interested suitors but she was not interested in them. One day a monster appeared at a party in the city provoking terror. The monster went to the Carvajal house and ate the younger son, who was playing out front of the house. Pedro offered a large reward for the capture of the beast. <b>One</b> <b>young</b> <b>man,</b> who wanted the hand of Pedro’s daughter, appeared at another festival, bearing the head of the beast.

40|$|From {{a medical}} perspective, {{exercise}} {{and physical activity}} are valuable tools for losing weight, through an increase in energy expenditure. However, beyond this instrumental value, physical activity has meaning for the person experiencing it. Among individuals categorized as obese, that meaning is often problematic. The aim {{of this paper is}} to produce essential knowledge about <b>one</b> <b>young</b> <b>mans</b> embodied experiences of practicing martial art. Through a phenomenological analysis of research material concerning the young man’s passionate relationship to martial arts, we identify ways in which someone who has a body often regarded negatively, might still derive great pleasure from his movement experiences...|$|R
60|$|This was Carker the Manager. Mr Carker the Junior, Walter's friend, was his brother; two {{or three}} years older than he, but widely removed in station. The younger brother's post was {{on the top of the}} {{official}} ladder; the elder brother's at the bottom. The elder brother never gained a stave, or raised his foot to mount <b>one.</b> <b>Young</b> <b>men</b> passed above his head, and rose and rose; but he was always at the bottom. He was quite resigned to occupy that low condition: never complained of it: and certainly never hoped to escape from it.|$|R

2500|$|This section {{bears the}} title of Townsend Hoopes' best-known book. In 2004, of a seminar that brought a group of Muslim {{students}} to the US, he observed [...] "A vital {{point here is that}} the realities of modernity (technical, social, political) are inexorable. They cannot be wished away, which means that traditional societies are faced with a crucial choice: to adjust, to adapt or to risk steady decline and perhaps ultimate disappearance. Given this daunting paradigm, the genuine enthusiasm for America shown by our 21 Muslim guests was a heartening sign. They seemed impressed with the depth of our national commitment to human freedom and individual opportunity, and the stability of our institutions, both governmental and private. Several declared that exposure to America had reinforced their determination to work for social change in their own countries. Two Pakistani women, both law students, said they planned to devote their lives to fighting for broader women's rights at home. <b>One</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> said it was his ambition to become his country's prime minister.|$|E
