5|$|Despite {{being an}} internationally {{successful}} film, Let the Right One In was not submitted by Sweden for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The details surrounding the film's eligibility for the award resulted in some confusion. Being released on 24 October 2008, the film {{would normally be}} eligible for submission for the 82nd Academy Awards. However, the producers decided to release it on 24 September as a seven-day limited run only in Luleå. This would be exactly enough to meet the criteria for the 81st Academy Awards instead. When the Swedish Film Institute on 16 September announced that Jan Troell's Everlasting Moments had been selected instead <b>of</b> <b>Let</b> the Right One In, the Luleå screenings were cancelled. Despite {{the fact that the}} film was released within the eligibility period for the 82nd Academy Awards, it wasn't among the films considered because the Swedish Film Institute doesn't allow a film to be considered twice.|$|E
5|$|Interest in {{producing}} an English-language version <b>of</b> <b>Let</b> the Right One In began in 2007 shortly {{before it was}} released to audiences. In 2008, Hammer Films acquired the rights for the English adaptation and initially offered Tomas Alfredson, {{the director of the}} Swedish film, the opportunity to direct, which he declined. Reeves was then signed to direct and write the screenplay. Reeves made several changes for the English version such as altering the setting from Stockholm to New Mexico and renaming the lead characters. The film's producers stated that their intent was to keep the plot similar to the original, yet make it more accessible to a wider audience. Principal photography began in early November 2009, and concluded in January 2010. The film's budget was estimated to be $20 million.|$|E

500|$|The lyrics <b>of</b> <b>Let</b> the Blind Lead are autobiographical in nature, {{reflecting}} {{life experiences}} of Cox. [...] These include abuses he {{received as a}} child, past drug addictions, and the time he spent hospitalized as a teenager due to his genetic disorder Marfan syndrome. [...] Several songs concern his best friend Lockett Pundt, the guitarist for Deerhunter, whom the album is dedicated to. [...] "Winter Vacation" [...] is a reflection on {{the first time the}} two met, while in [...] "Ativan", Cox examines his relationship with Pundt. [...] Let the Blind Lead was generally well-received by critics; some praised Cox's emotional lyrics, while others criticized his music for lacking substance.
