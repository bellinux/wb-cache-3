5|$|It is {{possible}} that <b>other</b> <b>planets</b> with shorter orbital periods than HAT-P-33b exist in the system. However, {{at the time of}} HAT-P-33b's discovery, not enough radial velocity measurements had been collected to determine if this is so.|$|E
5|$|Paleontology even {{contributes}} to astrobiology, {{the investigation of}} possible life on <b>other</b> <b>planets,</b> by developing models of how life may have arisen and by providing techniques for detecting evidence of life.|$|E

5|$|The {{gravitational}} perturbations of the <b>other</b> <b>planets</b> in the Solar System {{combine to}} modify the orbit of the Earth and the orientation of its spin axis. These changes can influence the planetary climate.|$|E
5|$|There {{could conceivably}} be <b>other</b> <b>planets</b> {{in the system}} that do not transit the star, but they would only be {{detectable}} by the effects of their gravity on {{the motion of the}} visible planets (much as how Neptune was discovered).|$|E
5|$|Cirrus clouds form on <b>other</b> <b>planets,</b> {{including}} Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, {{and possibly}} Neptune. They {{have even been}} seen on Titan, one of Saturn's moons. Some of these extraterrestrial cirrus clouds are composed of ammonia or methane ice rather than water ice. The term cirrus is also used for certain interstellar clouds composed of sub-micrometer-sized dust grains.|$|E
50|$|A {{major feature}} of Planet Half-Life, and all <b>other</b> <b>planet</b> sites, is its public forum. These forums include boards ranging from general {{discussion}} to technical help.|$|R
50|$|The {{eccentricity}} {{is greater}} than that of every <b>other</b> <b>planet</b> except Mercury, and this causes a large difference between the aphelion and perihelion distances—they are 1.6660 and 1.3814 AU.|$|R

5|$|Converts were {{provided}} with elaborate details of Ernest and Ruth Norman's purported spiritual visits to <b>other</b> <b>planets.</b> The couple believed that humans could learn from great teachers on these journeys; Ernest said that this contact held the potential to educate and heal humanity. Ernest also spoke of the scientific advancements of other worlds. The couple also discussed revelations about their past lives, including Jesus and Mary of Bethany among their past identities. Ruth stated that she had lived about 50lives over several million years; she recalled being several well-known and a few obscure people on Earth, as well as beings from <b>other</b> <b>planets</b> and an archangel. Their group developed a mythology from the accounts that Ernest and Ruth gave of these lives, including tales from their past incarnations in Atlantis and Lemuria. Some of their stories were similar to the plots of contemporary books and films, prompting Tumminia to cast their beliefs as a pastiche or bricolage of the surrounding culture.|$|E
5|$|Mars has a {{relatively}} pronounced orbital eccentricity of about 0.09; {{of the seven}} <b>other</b> <b>planets</b> in the Solar System, only Mercury has a larger orbital eccentricity. It is known that in the past, Mars has had a much more circular orbit. At one point, 1.35 million Earth years ago, Mars had an eccentricity of roughly 0.002, much {{less than that of}} Earth today. Mars's cycle of eccentricity is 96,000 Earth years compared to Earth's cycle of 100,000 years. Mars has a much longer cycle of eccentricity, with a period of 2.2 million Earth years, and this overshadows the 96,000-year cycle in the eccentricity graphs. For the last 35,000 years, the orbit of Mars has been getting slightly more eccentric because of the gravitational effects of the <b>other</b> <b>planets.</b> The closest distance between Earth and Mars will continue to mildly decrease for the next 25,000 years.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent radial {{velocity}} measurements by the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer on the telescopes of W.M. Keck Observatory confirmed the planetary {{nature of the}} transit event and established a mass estimate for the planet. The planet's existence was announced on January 4, 2010 along with four <b>other</b> <b>planets</b> detected by Kepler: Kepler-5b, 6b, 7b and 8b at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington, D.C.|$|E

50|$|The Sunday, Tuesday, Saturday and Rahu {{planets are}} {{considered}} to be Malefics, or planets with an evil influence while the Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday planets are considered Benefics, or planets with benign influence. Ketu is considered to be the most powerful and a Benefic but as the chief planet, it cannot be grouped with any <b>other</b> <b>planet.</b> However, modern Burmese astrology rarely uses Ketu, and tends to use only the <b>other</b> eight <b>planets.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Some asteroids have unusual {{horseshoe}} orbits {{that are}} co-orbital with Earth or some <b>other</b> <b>planet.</b> Examples are 3753 Cruithne and [...] The first instance {{of this type}} of orbital arrangement was discovered between Saturn's moons Epimetheus and Janus.|$|R
5|$|The angular {{value of}} the {{obliquity}} is found by observation of the motions of Earth and <b>other</b> <b>planets</b> over many years. Astronomers produce new fundamental ephemerides as the accuracy of observation improves and as {{the understanding of the}} dynamics increases, and from these ephemerides various astronomical values, including the obliquity, are derived.|$|E
5|$|The game {{follows the}} {{anthropomorphic}} character Ratchet meeting the robot Clank {{on his home}} planet. Clank discovers that the villainous Chairman Drek of the Blarg race plans {{to create a new}} planet for his species, destroying <b>other</b> <b>planets</b> in the process. Clank convinces Ratchet to help him in his mission to gain the help of the famous superhero Captain Qwark.|$|E
5|$|The high {{eccentricity}} of the planet's orbit {{suggests that}} either the Kozai mechanism (there is an exchange between the inclination of a planet and its eccentricity) is at work, or that the planet's orbit was distorted by the unstable orbit of <b>other</b> <b>planets</b> {{that used to be}} part of the HD 154672 system.|$|E
50|$|Each {{of these}} Chiefs, Chieftainesses, Gods and Goddesses are only {{advanced}} angels according to Oahspe. And every angel, regardless of rank or office, {{was once a}} mortal, either from this planet earth or from some <b>other</b> <b>planet</b> in the universe.|$|R
50|$|Astrobiophysics is a {{field of}} {{intersection}} between astrophysics and biophysics concerned with {{the influence of the}} astrophysical phenomena upon life on planet Earth or some <b>other</b> <b>planet</b> in general. It differs from astrobiology which is concerned with the search of extraterrestrial life.|$|R

5|$|A third {{suggested}} alignment {{was some}} sort of planetary conjunction occurring on 21 December 2012; however, there was no conjunction on that date. Multi-planet alignments did occur in both 2000 and 2010, each with no ill result for the Earth. Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System; larger than all <b>other</b> <b>planets</b> combined. When Jupiter is near opposition, the difference in gravitational force that the Earth experiences is less than 1% of the force that the Earth feels daily from the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Aether is a {{video game}} {{designed}} by Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel and published by Armor Games, released on September 3, 2008. Players control a lonely boy and an octopus-like monster that the boy encounters, solving puzzles on different planets to restore them from monochrome to color. The pair travel through space by swinging on clouds and asteroids with the monster's elongated tongue, searching <b>other</b> <b>planets</b> for life to which the boy can relate. It is {{also a part of}} The Basement Collection.|$|E
5|$|All of the Solar System planets except Mercury have {{substantial}} atmospheres because their gravity {{is strong enough}} to keep gases close to the surface. The larger giant planets are massive enough to keep large amounts of the light gases hydrogen and helium, whereas the smaller planets lose these gases into space. The composition of Earth's atmosphere is different from the <b>other</b> <b>planets</b> because the various life processes that have transpired on the planet have introduced free molecular oxygen.|$|E
25|$|The air {{pressure}} at Venus' surface is about 92 {{times that of}} the Earth. The enormous amount of CO2 in the atmosphere creates a strong greenhouse effect, raising the surface temperature to around 470°C, hotter than that of any <b>other</b> <b>planet</b> in the Solar System.|$|R

50|$|K2-33b {{is known}} remarkably for its {{extremely}} young age, only one <b>other</b> <b>planet</b> is younger (V830 Tau b), with {{an age of}} around 2 million years, while K2-33b is only 9.3 million years old. Nonetheless, {{it is quite a}} discovery in the search of exoplanets.|$|R
5|$|Because their {{elliptical}} orbits frequently {{take them}} {{close to the}} giant planets, comets are subject to further gravitational perturbations. Short-period comets have a tendency for their aphelia to coincide with a giant planet's semi-major axis, with the JFCs being the largest group. It is clear that comets {{coming in from the}} Oort cloud often have their orbits strongly influenced by the gravity of giant planets {{as a result of a}} close encounter. Jupiter is the source of the greatest perturbations, being more than twice as massive as all the <b>other</b> <b>planets</b> combined. These perturbations can deflect long-period comets into shorter orbital periods.|$|E
5|$|Between September 2008 and December 2010, twenty-two spectra were {{collected}} using the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) instrument at Hawaii's W.M. Keck Observatory. This data {{was used to}} derive HAT-P-33's radial velocity. A far greater number of spectra were gathered for HAT-P-33 than the number usually gathered for planetary candidates {{to compensate for the}} data's jitter effect. It was concluded that the jitter in the data was caused by stellar activity and not the presence of <b>other</b> <b>planets.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cicero {{stated the}} twins {{objection}} (that with close birth times, personal outcomes {{can be very}} different), later developed by Saint Augustine. He argued that since the <b>other</b> <b>planets</b> are much more distant from the earth than the moon, they could have only very tiny influence compared to the moon's. He also argued that if astrology explains everything about a person's fate, then it wrongly ignores the visible effect of inherited ability and parenting, changes in health worked by medicine, or {{the effects of the}} weather on people.|$|E
5000|$|Each planet's {{movement}} is perturbed by {{the gravity of}} every <b>other</b> <b>planet.</b> This leads to short-term fluctuations in its speed, and therefore its period from year to year. Moreover, it causes long-term changes in its orbit, and therefore also long-term changes in these periods.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{epicyclic}} gear trains employ two planetary gears which mesh with each other. One of these planets meshes {{with the sun}} gear, the <b>other</b> <b>planet</b> meshes with the ring gear. This results in different ratios being generated by the planetary. The fundamental equation becomes: ...|$|R
5000|$|One <b>other</b> <b>planet</b> {{has been}} {{detected}} {{within the same}} planetary system. It is designated [...] "Kapteyn c" [...] and orbits further out from the star, beyond {{the outer edge of}} the habitable zone. It is considered to be too cold for stellar-light based life.|$|R
