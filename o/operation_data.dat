40|$|Our {{research}} has investigated {{the feasibility of}} directly sourcing autonomous <b>operations</b> <b>data</b> from a construction-vehicle positioning system, so as to enable productivity analysis and simulation modeling in the practical context of ready mixed concrete production and delivery. In this paper, we first review research efforts related to applying radio frequency identification tags and global positioning system for tracking construction resources and acquiring <b>operations</b> <b>data</b> in the field. We then describe the technical design and system components of an automated data collection (ADC) solution to accumulating concrete delivery <b>operations</b> <b>data,</b> which is extended from a construction-vehicle positioning system tailored for highly dense urban areas. We further elaborate on how our ADC system captures, transforms, and analyzes data of mixer truck operations. Truck-tracking experiment results based on field trials are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of data sourced from our ADC system with respect to: (1) analyzing truck-waiting time versus truck-unloading time on site; and (2) predicting truck's plant-to-site travel time. In conclusion, the ADC solution resulting from this research not only allows sophisticated analysis of mixer truck resource utilization at concreting sites situated in highly dense urban areas, but also provides an accumulation of input data that will enable concrete plant operations simulation modeling.

5000|$|By 1985, the satellite's {{batteries}} were degrading. This {{caused more}} and more frequent [...] "under-voltage cutoffs", a condition where the satellite detected a low main bus voltage and automatically shut down all non-vital systems. In addition, {{the last of the}} three tape recorders failed in the spring of 1985, so data collection could only occur while the spacecraft was in contact with a ground station. A normal contact lasted only about 15 minutes, so this was a serious impediment. Special arrangements could be made to string several contacts together. As a result of these failures, an ever-increasing amount of time and network resources were spent reconfiguring the satellite for normal <b>operation.</b> <b>Data</b> collection from the few remaining payloads was severely limited. Because of the additional burden on the Air Force Satellite Control Network (e.g., extra support and antenna time at the tracking stations), discussions were already underway to terminate the mission.|$|E
5000|$|The G-15 was {{inspired}} by the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE). It is a [...] serial-architecture machine, in which the main memory is a magnetic drum. It uses the drum as a recirculating delay line memory, in contrast to the analog delay line implementation in other serial designs. Each track has a set of read and write heads; as soon as a bit was read off a track, it is re-written on the same track a certain distance away. The length of delay, and thus the number of words on a track, is determined by the spacing of the read and write heads, the delay corresponding to the time required for a section of the drum to travel from the write head to the corresponding read head. Under normal <b>operation,</b> <b>data</b> are written back without change, but this data flow can be intercepted at any time, allowing the machine to update sections of a track as needed.|$|E
5000|$|Programs written using SHMEM can {{be started}} on several computers, {{connected}} together with some high-performance network, supported by used SHMEM library. Every computer runs {{a copy of}} a program (SPMD); each copy is called PE (processing element). PEs can ask the SHMEM library to do remote memory-access operations, like reading ("shmem_get" [...] operation) or writing ("shmem_put" [...] <b>operation)</b> <b>data.</b> Peer-to-peer operations are one-sided, which means that no active cooperation from remote thread is needed to complete the action (but it can poll its local memory for changes using [...] "shmem_wait"). Operations can be done on short types like bytes or words, or on longer datatypes like arrays, sometimes evenly strided or indexed (only some elements of array are sent). For short datatypes, SHMEM can do atomic operations (CAS, fetch and add, atomic increment, etc.) even in remote memory. Also there are two different synchronization methods: task control sync (barriers and locks) and functions to enforce memory fencing and ordering. SHMEM has several collective operations, which should be started by all PEs, like reductions, broadcast, collect.|$|E
