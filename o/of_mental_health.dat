5|$|Changeling is a 2008 American mystery thriller film directed, co-produced {{and scored}} by Clint Eastwood and written by J.

The script was based on real-life events, specifically the 1928 Wineville Chicken Coop Murders in Mira Loma, California. The film stars Angelina Jolie as a woman reunited with a boy whom she immediately realizes is not her missing son. When she tries to demonstrate this {{to the police and}} city authorities, she is vilified as delusional, labeled as an unfit mother, and then confined to a psychiatric ward.|$|E

5|$|Non-genetic, environmental, post-infectious, or psychosocial factors—while not causing Tourette's—can {{influence}} its severity.

Children who meet five diagnostic criteria are classified, according to the hypothesis, as having Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections (PANDAS).

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{what kinds of}} background variables predict stigma and what impact stigma has on the utilization <b>of</b> formal <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services. Prior research indicates that gender, age cohort, rural versus urban residency, and socioeconomic status have differing effects on utilization. A model of health behavior was tested using data from a panel study of 1, 487 adults {{in the state of}} Iowa. The results indicate that stigma reflects the use <b>of</b> formal <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services and that the impact is different for men and women. For women, stigma has a direct effect on utilization <b>of</b> formal <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services and for men stigma has an indirect or moderating effect on symptoms <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> illness and utilization <b>of</b> formal <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services.

5|$|According to American {{psychiatrist}} Oleg Lapshin, Russia until 1993 did {{not have}} any specific legislation in the field <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> except uncoordinated instructions and articles of laws in criminal and administrative law, orders of the USSR Ministry of Health. In the Soviet Union, any psychiatric patient could be hospitalized by request of his headman, relatives or instructions of a district psychiatrist. In this case, patient's consent or dissent mattered nothing. The duration of treatment in a psychiatric hospital also depended entirely on the psychiatrist. All of that made the abuse of psychiatry possible to suppress those who opposed the political regime, and that created the vicious practice of ignoring the rights of the mentally ill.|$|E
5|$|According to Robert van Voren, {{although}} for several years, {{especially after the}} implosion of the USSR and during {{the first years of}} Boris Yeltsin's rule, the positions of the Soviet psychiatric leaders were in jeopardy, now one can firmly conclude that they succeeded in riding out the storm and retaining their powerful positions. They also succeeded in avoiding an inflow of modern concepts of delivering mental health care and a fundamental change in the structure of psychiatric services in Russia. On the whole, in Russia, the impact <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> reformers has been the least. Even the reform efforts made in such places as St. Petersburg, Tomsk, and Kaliningrad have faltered or were encapsulated as centrist policies under Putin brought them back under control.|$|E
5|$|Among Wetherby's other accomplishments {{were the}} {{creation}} of a Department <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> <b>Health</b> and the construction of fifteen hospitals and thirty health centers throughout the state. In 1952, he created the Youth Authority as a central point for the administration of services to delinquent children. He constructed new state prisons, modernized the probation and parole systems, and established a more orderly system of selecting grand and petit juries. He also oversaw some voting reform measures, including the provision of funds to purchase voting machines in areas where they were desired. He was not as successful in the area of government reform. He failed in his efforts to amend the state's constitution to allow the governor to succeed himself in office. He was also unable to win support for a plan to consolidate some of Kentucky's counties. In 1955, the state's voters approved a constitutional amendment granting suffrage to eighteen-year-olds over Wetherby's objections.|$|E

5|$|Mental health {{consists}} of a broad scope of measurements of mental well being including depression, stress and measurements of self-worth. Numerous factors affect the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> disorders among women in India, including older age, low educational attainment, fewer children in the home, lack of paid employment and excessive spousal alcohol use. There is also {{evidence to suggest that}} disadvantages associated with gender increase the risk for mental health disorders. Women who find it acceptable for men to use violence against female partners may view themselves as less valuable than men. In turn, this may lead women to seek out fewer avenues of healthcare inhibiting their ability to cope with various mental disorders.|$|E
