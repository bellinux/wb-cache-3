5|$|As {{many of the}} {{clinical}} {{signs and symptoms of}} ethylene glycol poisoning are nonspecific and occur in many poisonings the diagnosis is often difficult. It is most reliably diagnosed by the measurement of the blood ethylene glycol concentration. Ethylene glycol in biological fluids can be determined by gas chromatography. Many hospital laboratories do not have the ability to perform this blood test {{and in the absence of}} this test the diagnosis must be made based on {{the clinical}} presentation of the patient. In this situation a helpful test to diagnose poisoning is the measurement of the osmolal gap. The patients' serum <b>osmolality</b> is measured by freezing point depression and then compared with the predicted <b>osmolality</b> based on the patients' measured sodium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, and any ethanol that may have been ingested. The presence of a large osmolal gap supports a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning. However, a normal osmolar gap does not rule out ethylene glycol exposure because of wide individual variability.|$|E

In 1966, Crandell and colleagues reported a series in which 17/95 (18%) of patients developed an unusual type of nephropathy after operations in which methoxyflurane was used as a general anesthetic. This particular type of renal insufficiency was characterized by vasopressin-resistant high-output renal failure (production of large volumes of poorly concentrated urine) with a negative fluid balance, pronounced weight loss, elevation of serum sodium, chloride, <b>osmolality</b> and blood urea nitrogen. The urine of these patients was of a relatively fixed specific gravity and an <b>osmolality</b> very {{similar to that of the}} serum. Furthermore, the high urine output persisted a challenge test of fluid deprivation.

In 50 mosmol kg(− 1) solutions with 2. 5 – 5 mM L(− 1) KCl the motility inhibition was total, but reversible. The acrosome reaction was not induced by one of the described solutions, but the percentage of spermatozoa with reacted acrosomes was low (< 20 %) and highly variable in all experiments. The optimal extender base for cryopreservation was a solution consisting of 50 mM L(− 1) NaCl, 5 mM L(− 1) KCl, 10 mM L(− 1) Tris (pH 8. 5). From the tested cryoprotectants only dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and methanol provided sufficient cryoprotection.

25|$|A {{number of}} avian species use nasal salt glands, {{alongside}} their kidneys, to control hypertonicity {{in their blood}} plasma. However, the common ostrich shows no nasal glandular function in regard to this homeostatic process. Even {{in a state of}} dehydration, which increases the <b>osmolality</b> of the blood, nasal salt glands show no sizeable contribution of salt elimination. Also, the overall mass of the glands was less than that of the duck’s nasal gland. The common ostrich, having a heavier body weight, should have larger, heavier nasal glands to more effectively excrete salt from a larger volume of blood, {{but this is not the}} case. These unequal proportions contribute to the assumption that the common ostrich’s nasal glands do not play any role in salt excretion. The nasal glands may be the result of an ancestral trait, which is no longer needed by the common ostrich, but has not been bred out of their gene pool.|$|E
25|$|Normally {{metabolizing}} {{tooth root}} cells have an internal cell pressure (<b>osmolality)</b> of 280-300 mOs and a pH of 7.2. When {{there is an}} uninterrupted blood supply, all of the metabolites (calcium, phosphate, potassium) and glucose that the cells require are provided. When the tooth is knocked-out, this normal blood supply is cut off and within 15 minutes most of the stored metabolites have been depleted and the cells will begin to die. Within one to two hours, enough cells will die that rejection of the tooth by the body {{at a later time}} is the usual outcome. The method by which the body rejects the replanted tooth is a process called “replacement root resorption”. During this process, the tooth root cells become necrotic (dead) and will activate the immunologic mechanism of the body to attempt to remove this necrotic layer and literally eats away the tooth root. This is called “root resorption” It is a slow, but non-painful, process that is sometimes not observed by x-rays for years. Once this process starts, it is irreversible and the tooth will eventually fall out. In growing children, this can cause bone development problems because the replacement resorption (also termed ankylosis) attaches the tooth firmly to the jaw bone and stops normal tooth eruption and impedes normal jaw growth.|$|E

2500|$|Common ostrich kidneys {{are fairly}} large, {{and so are}} able to hold {{significant}} amounts of solutes. Hence, common ostriches drink relatively large volumes of water daily, and excrete generous quantities of highly concentrated urine. It is when drinking water is unavailable or withdrawn, that the urine becomes highly concentrated with uric acid and urates. It seems that common ostriches who normally drink relatively large amounts of water tend to rely on renal conservation of water when drinking water is scarce within the kidney system. Though {{there have been no}} official detailed renal studies conducted on the flow rate (Poiseuille's Law) and composition of the ureteral urine in the ostrich, knowledge of renal function has been based on samples of cloacal urine, and samples or quantitative collections of voided urine. Studies have shown that the amount of water intake, and dehydration impacts the plasma <b>osmolality</b> and urine <b>osmolality</b> within various sized ostriches. During a normal hydration state of the kidneys, young ostriches tend to have a measured plasma <b>osmolality</b> of 284 mOsm, and urine <b>osmolality</b> of 62 mOsm. Adults have higher rates with a plasma <b>osmolality</b> of 330 mOsm, and a urine <b>osmolality</b> of 163 mOsm. The <b>osmolality</b> of both plasma and urine can alter in regards to whether there is an excess or depleted amount of water present within the kidneys. An interesting fact of common ostriches is that when water is freely available, the urine <b>osmolality</b> can reduce to 60–70 mOsm, [...] not losing any necessary solutes from the kidneys when excess water is excreted. Dehydrated or salt-loaded ostriches can reach a maximal urine <b>osmolality</b> of approximately 800 mOsm. When the plasma <b>osmolality</b> has been measured simultaneously with the maximal osmotic urine, it is seen that the urine:plasma ratio is 2.6:1, the highest encountered among avian species.

40|$|Objective To {{identify}} the molecular basis and clinical characteristics of X-linked congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (CNDI) presenting {{with an unusual}} phenotype characterized by partial resistance to AVP. Subjects The proband was admitted {{at the age of}} 4 years with a history of polydipsia and polyuria since infancy. Initial clinical testing confirmed a diagnosis of diabetes insipidus (DI). Urine osmolarity rose during fluid deprivation and after 20 microg of intranasal desmopressin [1 -deamino- 8 -d-arginine-vasopressin (dDAVP) ]. A similar DI phenotype was found in his brother. Methods The coding regions of the AVP gene and the AVP receptor 2 (AVPR 2) genes were sequenced in two affected and three unaffected family members. Clinical studies included a fluid deprivation test, intranasal dDAVP challenge, infusion of graded doses of dDAVP and AVP, and measurements of 24 -h urine output before {{and at the end of}} a 7 -day therapeutic trial of intranasal dDAVP. Results A novel missense mutation (1454 C > A) in exon 3 of the AVPR 2 gene predicting a Ser 329 Arg substitution was identified in the X-chromosome of the two affected brothers and in one of the X-chromosomes in the mother. The AVPR 2 gene was normal in two unaffected siblings. Under basal conditions, the 24 -h urine volumes of the two affected boys were 5. 5 l (229 ml/kg) and 3. 5 l (192 ml/kg), the urine <b>osmolalities</b> were 78 and 90 mosm/kg, and plasma AVP 13. 5 and 19. 0 pg/ml. Urine <b>osmolalities</b> increased to 573 and 720 mosm/kg while plasma AVP levels were practically unchanged, 13. 6 and 8. 8 pg/ml, during fluid deprivation. Infusion of AVP resulted in urine <b>osmolalities</b> of 523 and 623 mosm/kg at plasma AVP levels of 58 and 42 pg/ml. Infusion of dDAVP had a similar effect, while treatment with standard doses of intranasal dDAVP had no effect on urine output. Discussion The affected members of this Belgian kindred have CNDI with partial resistance to AVP caused by a mutation in the AVPR 2 gene that differs from any of the six mutations reported previously to produce this phenotype.
