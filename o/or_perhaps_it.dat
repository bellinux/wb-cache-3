25|$|The {{earliest}} known publication {{describing the}} Syrian hamster was in Patrick Russell's 1797 revision and second {{edition of his}} half-brother Alexander Russell's 1756 The Natural History of Aleppo. Alexander Russell was a Scottish physician who {{had been living in}} Syria from 1740 till 1750 or 55, and while in Aleppo, he documented the natural history of the region. Patrick Russell moved to Aleppo in 1750 and stayed there till 1781, and like his brother documented natural history. It is uncertain which brother wrote the description of the hamster for the book. Perhaps Patrick took it from Alexander's unpublished notes <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> was Patrick's own addition to the book in the second edition.|$|E
500|$|A {{specialist}} in Catholic social doctrine argues, circa 1994, that [...] "the words 'bank' and 'banking' are almost nonexistent {{in the documents}} of modern Catholic social teaching. Perhaps because the medieval teaching was never formally retracted that money was unproductive and therefore money lending at interest was therefore immoral, yet the church itself became an active investor.... <b>Or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> was because the church was deeply involved in financial matters {{at the highest levels}} that it was in no position to criticise." ...|$|E
500|$|The oldest (and {{also the}} only) {{manuscript}} {{was written in}} 1762, after Bach's death. The provenance of the cantata is disputed: some suggest {{that it may not}} be a Bach work because of its [...] "unpretentious" [...] nature and the lack of authoritative original music, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> was a transposition of an earlier work. Alternatively, part of the cantata may have been written by Bach, while other parts (likely the choruses and the bass aria) were added or amended by other composers. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, remarks on the stylistic similarity of the text structure to Bach's early cantatas written in Mühlhausen. He also sees similar musical expression to the cantata for the inauguration of a new town council there, Gott ist mein König, BWV 71, written in 1708. While some musicologists assume that it may have been composed for the same occasion one year later, Gardiner proposes that it could either be a still earlier work, or that it [...] "was, at least in part, an apprentice piece written in Weimar under Bach's direct tutelage.|$|E

500|$|According to Procopius (The Vandalic War, I.11), {{the army}} {{consisted}} of 10,000 infantry, partly {{drawn from the}} field army (comitatenses) and partly from among the foederati, as well as 5,000 cavalry. There were also some 1,500–2,000 of Belisarius' own retainers (bucellarii), an elite corps (it is unclear if their number {{is included in the}} 5,000 cavalry mentioned as a total figure by Procopius). In addition, there were two additional bodies of allied troops, both mounted archers, 600 Huns and 400 Heruls. The army was led by an array of experienced officers, among whom the eunuch Solomon was chosen as Belisarius' chief of staff (domesticus) and the former praetorian prefect Archelaus was placed in charge of the army's provisioning. The whole force was transported on 500 vessels manned by 30,000 sailors under admiral Calonymus of Alexandria, guarded by ninety-two dromon warships. The traditional view, as expressed by J.B. Bury, is that the expeditionary force was remarkably small for the task, especially given the military reputation of the Vandals, and that perhaps it reflects the limit of the fleet's carrying capacity, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> was an intentional move to limit the impact of any defeat. Ian Hughes however comments that even in comparison with the armies of the early Roman Empire, Belisarius' army was a [...] "large, well-balanced force capable of overcoming the Vandals and may have contained a higher proportion of high quality, reliable troops than the armies stationed in the east".|$|E
500|$|This episode {{received}} generally {{positive response}} from critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave [...] "Road to the North Pole" [...] a positive review, stating {{that it is}} [...] "a satisfying episode of Family Guy all around, filled with funny gags and nice moments." [...] He especially praised the musical segments, and the portrayal of the North Pole, writing that [...] "the way the episode kept piling more and more ridiculous horrors {{on top of each}} other kept the whole thing funny." [...] He rated the episode an [...] "A-". Jason Hughes of TV Squad also praised the songs and the depiction of Santa's factory, though he found the delivery of the episode's message [...] "heavy-handed." [...] Kate Moon of TV Fanatic gave the episode 3.6 out of 5 stars. She said, [...] "I had mixed feelings about this one, despite its clever moments and hopeful ending. [...] While I normally have no problems about Family Guys shocking or offensive themes, I felt bit disconcerted about the direction of this Christmas episode." [...] She went on to say, [...] "Perhaps it was the way that the series stomped on something as innocent as Santa and his elves and twisted them all around. <b>Or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> was the cannibalistic reindeer. [...] Whatever the specific reason, the irreverent nature of Family Guy seemed just a little too graphic for me this time around." [...] Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number twelve on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and described the episode as [...] "Christmas comedy gold", praising the 'Christmastime is Killing Us' song and Boreanaz's cameo.|$|E

2500|$|Whilst {{the style}} of Giorgione's {{painting}} clearly relates to that of his presumed master, Giovanni Bellini, his subject matter makes {{him one of the}} most original and abstruse artists of the Renaissance. One of his paintings, of a landscape known as The Tempest, with a semi-naked woman feeding a baby, a clothed man, some classical columns and a flash of lightning, perhaps represents Adam and Eve in their post-Eden days, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> does not. [...] Another painting attributed to him and traditionally known as The Three Philosophers, may represent the Magi planning their journey in search of the infant Christ, but this is not certain either.|$|E
2500|$|The {{origin of}} the name Alvis {{has been the subject}} of a great deal of {{speculation}} over the years. Some have suggested that de Freville proposed the name Alvis as a compound of the words [...] "aluminium" [...] and [...] "vis" [...] (meaning [...] "strength" [...] in Latin), <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> may have been derived from the Norse mythological weaponsmith, Alvíss. De Freville however vigorously rejected all of these theories. In 1921 he specifically stated that the name had no meaning whatsoever, and was chosen simply because it could be easily pronounced in any language. He reaffirmed this position in the early 1960s, stating that any other explanations for the source of the name were purely coincidental.|$|E

2500|$|The infinitive suffix -i may {{derive from}} Latin {{deponent}} verbs, such as loqui (to speak). With elements like these {{that are only}} one or two letters long, {{it is difficult to know}} whether resemblances are due to the forms being related, or just coincidence. For example, it is speculated that the jussive -u is from the Hebrew imperative -û, but it could also be from the Greek [...] imperative of deponent verbs such as dekhou (receive!); <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> was inspired by [...] being found in both Hebrew and Greek. Similarly, adverbial -e is found in Latin and Italian (bene) as well as in Russian (after a palatalized consonant); the participle bases -t- and -nt- are found in Latin, Italian, Greek, and German; and the pronominal base -i is found in Italian (-mi, -ti, -vi, -si, -gli for Esperanto mi, ci, vi, si, li) and English (me, we, he, she).|$|E
2500|$|Cecil is {{also very}} serious when doing this {{research}} to develop games that have strong ties to historic locales and myths, [...] "I take the historical research and research of our locations very seriously and will generally visit the locations to undertake recces. Of course this is almost always a pleasure – the games aim to feature locations that are exciting and interesting." [...] In the same interview he stated that the name Broken Sword may have been chosen {{because it is a}} symbol of peace. He also added that {{it might have been a}} fate of history that this name was chosen: [...] "I live in the city of York in England and a few years ago a statue of Constantine the Great was erected next to the cathedral to commemorate his coronation in the city in 306AD. The statue depicts Constantine sitting atop a broken sword; it seemed a fun coincidence, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> is down to fate." ...|$|E
2500|$|The BA was {{introduced}} and first produced in 1940. No more than 17 were built. [...] Some sources, however, claim the model {{did not enter}} production, such as it was, until 1943, with one giving the date of June 1943. But judging from 1943's production figures, the majority of which would have to represent the AC, it would {{not seem to be}} the case that all 17 BA production cars were built that year. [...] The production of the 17 cars may have occurred in 1940 and 1943, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> was stretched over the 1940–1943 period, with the last few being completed in 1943, when the model was said to have started [...] "official" [...] production. Support for the notion that at least a few of these cars were produced in 1943 would come from a photograph (obtained from Toyota Motor Co.

2500|$|Émile Courtet's job as one {{of several}} assistants to Gill was to {{complete}} the backgrounds; he may have done {{a few of the}} illustrations by himself. [...] During this process, the young man developed a style of caricature based on Gill's. Gill's trademark was the large, recognizable head of the target (with a fairly benign expression) atop a small puppet body (doing something ridiculous). Clearly, it was based on Fantoche puppetry. Émile took this style and added touches to suggest movement and imagery from the rest of Guignol puppetry. At about this time he adopted the pseudonym of Émile Cohl. The meaning of [...] "Cohl" [...] is obscure: it may be from the pigment known as [...] "kohl", <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> means that Émile stuck to his mentor Gill like glue ("colle" [...] in French). Perhaps it was chosen because it sounded exotic. The visual signature of a paste-pot appears in a few of Cohl's caricatures.|$|E
