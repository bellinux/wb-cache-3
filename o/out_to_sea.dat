5|$|MV New Carissa was a {{freighter}} {{that ran}} aground {{on a beach}} near Coos Bay, Oregon, United States, during a storm in February 1999 and subsequently broke apart. An attempt to tow the bow section of the ship <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> failed when the tow line broke, and the bow was grounded again. Eventually, the bow was successfully towed <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> and sunk. The stern section remained on the beach near Coos Bay. Fuel on board the ship was burned off in situ with napalm, but a significant amount was also spilled from the wreckage, causing ecological damage to the coastline.|$|E

5|$|Although each {{adult and}} {{independent}} juvenile forages alone, sea otters tend to rest together in single-sex groups called rafts. A raft typically contains 10 to 100 animals, with male rafts being larger than female ones. The largest raft ever seen contained over 2000 sea otters. To keep from drifting <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> when resting and eating, sea otters may wrap themselves in kelp.|$|E
5|$|For several days, Gert {{threatened}} to strike Bermuda, prompting {{the evacuation of}} tourists. Although Gert's center did not make landfall, it passed a short distance east of the island, producing hurricane-force winds that left 11,000people without power. High waves swept two people <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> at Acadia National Park in Maine. Later, strong waves struck Newfoundland and left heavy marine damage.|$|E

5|$|Nevada then {{departed}} for Norfolk Navy Yard in June for further modernization. After this was completed, Nevada went on Atlantic convoy duty. Old battleships such as Nevada {{were attached to}} many convoys across the Atlantic to guard against the chance that a German capital ship might head <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> on a raiding mission.|$|E
5|$|September 13–14, 1997: Hurricane Linda was at {{one point}} {{forecast}} to make landfall in southern California. Instead, it moved <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea,</b> although large waves caused by Linda did wash five people off a jetty in Newport Beach. Also, Linda's outer rainbands generated thunderstorms over southern California, causing flash floods in some regions.|$|E

5|$|The first {{tropical}} storm {{of the season}} formed 75mi (120km) south-southwest of Puerto Vallarta on June 11. Tropical Storm One headed <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> without intensifying further than 50mph (80km/h). Heading west-northwestward, the storm dissipated on July 12, centered roughly halfway between Socorro Island and Cabo San Lucas.|$|E
5|$|The {{second reason}} is the general path of {{tropical}} cyclones in the eastern Pacific. They generally move north-westward or westward due to steering by the prevailing upper level winds, which takes them far <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> and away from land.|$|E
5|$|The storm then {{continued}} north {{for twenty minutes}} over the North Shore suburbs of Sydney before regaining strength and veering northnorthwest again, redeveloping severe thunderstorm characteristics. The storm's redevelopment again caught the Bureau of Meteorology off-guard, who had expected the storm to dissipate and move <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> without causing further substantial damage.|$|E

5|$|While <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> in August of the 1965 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season, Stormfury meteorologists {{decided that}} Hurricane Betsy {{was a good}} candidate for seeding. However, the storm immediately swung towards land, and on September 1, the planned flights were canceled. For some reason, the press was not notified that there were no seedings, and several newspapers reported that it had begun. As Betsy passed close to the Bahamas and smashed into southern Florida, the public and Congress thought that seeding was underway and blamed Stormfury. It took two months for Stormfury officials to convince Congress that Betsy was not seeded, and the project was allowed to continue. A second candidate, Hurricane Elena, stayed too far <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{additional}} weather-related delays, on February 26 salvors {{managed to}} float the 440foot(132m) bow section {{and began the}} process of towing it <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> for disposal. By March 1, the tugboat Sea Victory had towed the bow from the beach and <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea,</b> initially followed by an oil skimmer vessel, OSRV Oregon Responder. However, another severe storm forced the skimmer back to port, and when the tug was 50miles(65km) off the coast, the tow line broke. The bow section floated for fourteen hours until it ran aground near Waldport, Oregon on March 3, approximately 80miles (130km) {{to the north of}} the original grounding site. On March 8, the bow was again refloated, and by March 11 it was successfully towed 280miles(450km) off the coast by Sea Victory and a second tug, Natoma. At this location, the Pacific Ocean is approximately 10,000feet (3,000m) deep. The bow was sunk by two US Navy ships, the destroyer USS David R. Ray and the submarine USS Bremerton. Four hundred pounds (180kg) of high explosives were attached to the bow and detonated. Sixty-nine rounds of gunfire from David R. Rays 5-inch (127mm) deck guns then punctured the hull. After 40 minutes, the ship was still afloat with darkness and a storm approaching. To expedite the sinking, Bremerton fired a Mark 48 torpedo at the underside of the ship. Within ten minutes, the bow section flooded and sank stern-first, trapping the remaining oil within.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} {{the list of}} 21 tropical cyclone names {{for the first time}} ever, the NHC began naming storms with the Greek alphabet. Epsilon was the fifth name of the list, and ultimately there was one additional storm, making the 2005 season the most active on record with 27named storms. Since Epsilon stayed well <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> and never approached land, no warnings or watches were issued. No ships reported tropical storm force winds from Epsilon and there were no damages or fatalities.|$|E
