40|$|Abstract: Laboratory {{testing in}} <b>office</b> <b>practice</b> is an {{important}} element in the comprehensive delivery of ambulatory health services to both primary care and specialty patients. Laboratory testing occurs in 10 - 20 % of ambulatory office visits, but its impact on patient care outcomes remains largely unknown. Efforts to understand better laboratory problems in <b>office</b> <b>practice</b> should focus on pre- and post-analytic phases {{as well as on the}} impact of other forces currently shaping <b>office</b> <b>practice</b> (e. g., managed care). The process of obtaining adequate tests is becoming at least as complex and expensive as the issues surrounding the accurate performance of the tests themselves. Future research efforts should examine which office-based laboratory testing is essential for timely clinical decision making and favorable patient care outcomes. Wherever possible, methods of streamlining and consolidating the process of laboratory testing should be pursued, while appropriate safeguards for accuracy and adequacy of results are maintained. Realizing that we all approach the issues patients into the medical neighborhood. It involved with the Clinical Laboratory must be a system that is functional...|$|R
