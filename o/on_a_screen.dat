5|$|Sega later {{produced}} gun games which resemble first-person light gun video games, {{but were}} in fact electro-mechanical games that used rear image projection {{in a manner similar}} to a zoetrope to produce moving animations <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>screen.</b> An early example of this was Duck Hunt, which Sega released in 1969; it featured animated moving targets <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>screen,</b> printed out the player's score on a ticket, and had sound effects that were volume controllable.|$|E

5|$|Blissymbols {{were first}} used in Canada in 1971 to provide {{communication}} to those {{not able to}} use traditional orthography; their use quickly spread to other countries. With improved technology, keyboard communication devices developed in Denmark, the Netherlands and the US increased in portability; the typed messages were displayed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>screen</b> or strip of paper. By {{the end of the}} 1970s, communication devices were being commercially produced, and a few, such as the HandiVoice, had voice output. Countries such as Sweden, Canada and the United Kingdom initiated government-funded services for those with severe communication impairments, including developing centres of clinical and research expertise.|$|E
5|$|Cowboys & Aliens is a 2011 American {{science fiction}} Western film {{directed}} by Jon Favreau and starring Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, and Olivia Wilde. The film {{is based on}} the 2006 graphic novel of the same name created by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg. The plot revolves around an amnesiac outlaw (Craig), a wealthy cattleman (Ford), and a mysterious traveler (Wilde) who must ally to save a group of townspeople abducted by aliens. The screenplay was written by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof, Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>screen</b> story by the latter two along with Steve Oedekerk. The film was produced by Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, Kurtzman, Orci and Rosenberg, with Steven Spielberg and Favreau serving as executive producers.|$|E
5|$|For {{scenes in}} the film that {{featured}} the moon in the background, a circle was drawn <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>screen</b> which was lit {{to make it look}} like the moon. Though having other lights were not possible, Bartley made sure that all the characters in such scenes had their shadows away from the moon. Despite this, many of the transformations of elements in this film were shown using dissolve techniques. No lights were hidden behind the painted moon, as a source for lighting.|$|E

5|$|Madonna trained {{physically}} doing aerobics, jogging and weight-lifting, to {{cope with}} the choreography and the dance routines. For the costumes, she collaborated with designer Marlene Stewart, expanding on the idea of bringing her popular video characters to life onstage, reworking scenes from her music videos. The stage had four video screens, multimedia projectors and a flight of stairs in the middle. Patrick Leonard, who was the music director, encouraged Madonna to go with the idea of remixing and presenting her older songs for the show. The title Who's That Girl came to Madonna's mind when during rehearsals one-day when she looked at a gigantic image of herself, projected <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>screen</b> on the stage.|$|E
5|$|On 15 October 2011, {{the stadium}} {{was open to}} Welsh Rugby Union fans free of charge, {{providing}} that they wear red {{so that they could}} watch a live screening of the 2011 Rugby World Cup semi-final between Wales and France that was played at Eden Park, Auckland, New Zealand. The match was screened on the stadium's existing large screens, on all of their television screens and <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>screen</b> that was brought in for the occasion. The same was done for the Bronze Final between Wales and Australia which saw Wales defeated and take fourth place.|$|E
5|$|Bushnell and Dabney {{began to}} design custom {{hardware}} {{to run the}} game's functions, and they soon discovered that the cost to build the whole game's computing systems would be much lower. As a result, they would not need to have multiple instances of the game running on the same machine {{in order to be}} profitable. On the other hand, however, the custom hardware was not as powerful as the more expensive Nova computer, which meant that the pair needed to make gameplay modifications. Spacewar was a two-player game featuring dogfights around the gravitational field of a central star; neither of these features could be run on the dedicated circuits the pair were making, so the game was cut down to a single-player game wherein the player would fight against two computer-controlled spaceships in open space. By January 1971, the pair had built some basic hardware which could connect to a monitor, with plans to continue expanding it to make a game now named Cosmic Combat, but they were still far away from turning what was then a dot moving <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>screen</b> into a full Spacewar-like game cabinet.|$|E

The film premiered at Carnegie Hall in New York City on December 17, 1999 for three nights {{as part of a}} five city concert tour. The animation was presented <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>screen</b> above the stage while Levine conducted the Philharmonia Orchestra with a video auto-cue to time the music to the images. Performances followed at the Royal Albert Hall in London on December 21; the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris on December 22; the Orchard Hall in Tokyo on December 27; and the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in Pasadena, California on December 31, where Derrick Inouye conducted as part of a black tie $2,000-per-head New Year's Eve event. Each of the seven performances cost over $1 million.|$|E
5|$|John pleads with General Ashdown {{to delay}} the {{offensive}} so he can formulate a plan to extract the human captives, but Ashdown refuses and relieves John of his command. However, the Resistance disobeys Ashdown's orders and instead, await John's signal. Marcus enters the base, interfaces with the computer, and disables perimeter defenses so that Connor can infiltrate the cellblock and release human prisoners. Wright learns from Skynet (which assumes the form of Dr. Kogan <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>screen),</b> that he was created and built from the original Wright's corpse to lure John to the base; when the Resistance launches its attack, John will be killed, achieving the goal that Skynet had failed to accomplish in the past. The hidden signal that the Resistance received earlier is revealed {{to have been a}} ruse, and Skynet uses it to track down and destroy the command submarine with the Resistance's leaders aboard.|$|E
5|$|When {{a crystal}} is mounted and exposed to an intense beam of X-rays, it {{scatters}} the X-rays into {{a pattern of}} spots or reflections that can be observed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>screen</b> behind the crystal. A similar pattern may be seen by shining a laser pointer at a compact disc. The relative intensities of these spots provide the information to determine the arrangement of molecules within the crystal in atomic detail. The intensities of these reflections may be recorded with photographic film, an area detector or with a charge-coupled device (CCD) image sensor. The peaks at small angles correspond to low-resolution data, whereas those at high angles represent high-resolution data; thus, an upper limit on the eventual resolution of the structure can be determined from the first few images. Some measures of diffraction quality can be determined at this point, such as the mosaicity of the crystal and its overall disorder, as observed in the peak widths. Some pathologies of the crystal that would render it unfit for solving the structure can also be diagnosed quickly at this point.|$|E

25|$|Originally, sprites were {{a method}} of {{integrating}} unrelated bitmaps so that {{they appeared to be}} part of the normal bitmap <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>screen,</b> such as creating an animated character that can be moved <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>screen</b> without altering the data defining the overall screen. Such sprites can be created by either electronic circuitry or software. In circuitry, a hardware sprite is a hardware construct that employs custom DMA channels to integrate visual elements with the main screen in that it super-imposes two discrete video sources. Software can simulate this through specialized rendering methods.|$|E
