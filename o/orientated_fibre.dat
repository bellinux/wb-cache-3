An expression is found relating the observed intensity function with the weighted integral along a circle of the intensity derived from the molecular structure factor. From this result in the case where the layer-line width is very small a correction factor may be derived which, if applied to the observed intensity, yields the intensity which would be obtained from a perfectly <b>orientated</b> <b>fibre.</b> The general problem of correcting for disorientation can only be treated by a numerical deconvolution procedure...|$|E
40|$|Electrospinning is {{a method}} used to produce {{nanoscale}} to microscale sized polymer fibres. In this study we electrospin 1 : 1 blends of deuterated and hydrogenated atactic- Polystyrene from N,N-Dimethylformamide for small angle neutron scattering experiments in order to analyse the chain conformation in the electrospun fibres. Small angle neutron scattering was carried out on randomly <b>orientated</b> <b>fibre</b> mats obtained using applied voltages of 10 kV- 15 kV and needle tip to collector distances of 20 cm and 30 cm. Fibre diameters varied from 3 μm – 20 μm. Neutron scattering data from fibre samples were compared with bulk samples of the same polymer blend. The scattering data indicates that there are pores and nanovoiding present in the fibres; this was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. A model that combines the scattering from the pores and the labelled polymer chains was used to extract values for the radius of gyration. The radius of gyration in the fibres is found to vary little with the applied voltage, but varies with the initial solution concentration and fibre diameter. The values for the radius of gyration in the fibres are broadly equivalent {{to that of the}} bulk state...|$|E
40|$|Electrospinning {{process is}} a simple and widely used method for {{producing}} polymeric nanofibres. However, despite its popularity, significant challenges remain in controlling the fibre deposition due to the complex nature of electrospinning process. The process is renowned for its chaotic motion of fibre deposition, {{also known as the}} whipping instability. This instability is caused by electrostatic and fluid dynamics interactions of the charged jet and it is partly responsible for the thinning of the fibres into nanoscale diameters. Due to the instability, an electrospinning process typically deposits random orientated fibres in a circular deposition area. Furthermore, there is no control over the location where the fibres land on the collector electrode except that the fibres always travel through the shortest trajectory between the source and the collector electrodes. In this study, an alternative controlled deposition technique was proposed based on electric field manipulation (EFM). The main hypothesis {{of this study is that}} a consistent and repeatable method of controlled deposition can be achieved by using EFM. EFM was achieved by introducing a pair of charged auxiliary electrodes positioned adjacent and perpendicular to the fibre deposition direction. The applied voltage of either direct current (dc) or time-varying (ac) voltage at the auxiliary electrodes act as control to influence the spatial location and size of the deposition area. Samples were produced on black paper substrates and scanned into greyscale images. An image analysis technique was developed to measure the shift and size of the deposition area. A computer simulation was used to calculate the electric field strength and to simulate the behaviour of fibre response based on the trajectory of a charged particle. An image analysis based on greyscale intensity measurement was also developed to examine the uniformity of the deposition area. Finally, fibre characterisation was carried out to examine the fibre morphology, diameter, and orientation based on scanning electron micrographs. The results from this study showed that EFM can provide a consistent and repeatable control of the deposition area. When the auxiliary electrodes were independently charged with two dc voltages, it was observed that the deposition area moved away from the most positive electrode. The magnitude of shift of the deposition area was found to increase linearly with voltage difference between the auxiliary electrodes. Furthermore, the aspect ratio of the deposition area (ratio of width over height) decreased linearly with base voltage i. e. lower of the two auxiliary electrode voltages. These two controls were found to act independently from each other and can be described as two separate controls i. e. voltage difference for spatial location and base voltage for aspect ratio of the deposition area. A similar response was observed in simulation i. e. the particle moved away from the most positive electrode. Simulation results also showed that the x-axis component of the electric field (Ex) was responsible for the shift in location and the reduction of aspect ratio of the deposition area. When the auxiliary electrodes were charged with two antiphase time-varying voltages, continuous scanning of the electrospinning jet was observed producing a wide electrospun fibre mat. It was first thought the smooth oscillation of a sine wave would produce a more uniform deposition pattern compared to a triangle wave, but the results showed otherwise. The inferior uniformity of the sine wave sample was found due to the variability of the jet scanning speed when compared to the constant speed achieved when using a triangle wave. It was also observed that the deposition pattern can be further improved by using two clipped triangle wave voltages. The results open up the possibility for further exploiting the control voltage to achieve the desired deposition pattern. Two case studies were presented to demonstrate the applicability of the technique in real electrospinning applications. In the first case study, it was demonstrated that the continuous scanning of electrospinning jet was capable of eliminating the stripe deposition pattern which is commonly associated to a multi-spinneret electrospinning system. In the second case study, it was found that the alignment and distribution of aligned fibres in a gap electrospinning system can be improved by using the EFM technique. A new technique was also introduced to produce a multi-layer <b>orientated</b> <b>fibre</b> construct. These application examples showed that the EFM technique is ready for the production of engineered electrospun fibre constructs. This would extend the use of electrospun fibres to applications which is currently limited by geometrical constraints of the fibre constructs...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to produce a simulation of fibrous thermal insulation, so that the overall thermal conductivity of the insulation can be predicted. This allows the thermal conductivity of the insulation to be determined, and the optimum fibre layup can be investigated. In order to ensure the model is behaving correctly, it was compared to the thermal conductivity of a glass fibre blanket. This blanket was produced using the needle-punch technique, and so was made largely of in-plane randomly <b>orientated</b> <b>fibres</b> with regular out-of-plane fibres extending through multiple fibre layers and holding all the fibre layers together. The geometry was generated using MATLAB, before being converted into a 3 D CAD model using ANSYS APDL, with the finite element analysis being carried out using ANSYS Workbench. The results of the simulation give an overall thermal conductivity that is very close to the experimentally measured thermal conductivity. As a result, the simulation can be considered to be accurate for at least some fibre orientations...|$|R

Herein, we evaluated the response of tenocytes, osteoblasts and corneal fibroblasts to the topographies created through electro-spinning and solvent casting. We also evaluated the influence of topography on mechanical properties. At day 14, human osteoblasts seeded on aligned orientated electro-spun mats exhibited the lowest metabolic activity (P 0. 05). Osteoblasts and corneal fibroblasts aligned parallel to the direction of the aligned orientated electro-spun mats, whilst tenocytes aligned perpendicular to the aligned orientated electro-spun mats. Mechanical evaluation demonstrated that aligned <b>orientated</b> electro-spun <b>fibres</b> exhibited significant higher stress at break values than their random aligned counterparts (P < 0. 006) and random <b>orientated</b> electro-spun <b>fibres</b> exhibited significant higher strain at break values than the aligned orientated scaffolds (P < 0. 006).

40|$|AbstractThe {{production}} of CFRP needs edge trimming {{in order to}} remove burrs as well as undefined <b>orientated</b> <b>fibres</b> and to shape the final part contour. Edge trimming is usually done by contour milling. The quality of machined edges may be affected by fibre protrusions and delaminated fibres which cause manual repair or may even lead to scrap. Delamination of fibres is often initiated by stresses applied during engagement of the cutting edge. Based on measured cutting forces, the stress distribution and the inter fibre fracture modes in the boundary zone of the machined surface are calculated using Lekhnitskii's theory of elasticity for anisotropic elastic bodies and the fracture criteria of Puck. In course of the continuing edge trimming process, fibre ends in the damaged boundary zone might not be cut off but deflected by subsequent tool engagements, as {{can be observed in}} high speed videos. In the case of existing fibre protrusions, a relation between the minimum depth of the damaged zone, the fibre orientation at the machined edge and the fibre properties was derived using elementary bending models. The analysis underlines the existence of only one type of surface ply delamination i. e. fibre protrusions and fibre delamination always occur together...|$|R

A Cedip Silver IR system is used for the TSA measurements with a standard 27 mm lens and a high resolution G 1 magnifying lens.

40|$|African {{elephants}} (Loxodonta africana) {{use their}} tusks for digging, carrying and behavioural display. Their healing ability following traumatic injury is enormous. Pain experience caused by dentin or pulp damage of tusks {{seems to be}} negligible in elephants. In this study we examined the pulp tissue and the nerve distribution using histology, electron microscopy and immunhistochemistry. The results demonstrate that the pulp comprises two differently structured regions. Randomly <b>orientated</b> collagen <b>fibres</b> characterize a cone-like part lying rostral to the foramen apicis dentis. Numerous nerve fibres and Ruffini endings are found within this cone. Rostral to the cone, delicate collagen fibres and large vessels are orientated longitudinally. The rostral two-thirds of the pulp are highly vascularized, whereas nerve fibres are sparse. Vessel and nerve fibre distribution {{and the structure of}} connective tissue possibly play important roles in healing and in the obviously limited pain experience after tusk injuries and pulp alteration.

40|$|Tendon {{injuries}} and degenerative conditions constitute an unmet clinical need with pharmacological strategies and tissue grafts failing to recapitulate native tendon function. Advancements in bioengineering have enabled {{the development of}} various scaffold fabrication technologies, using natural or synthetic in origin polymers that closely imitate the native tendon anisotropic architecture. Anisotropic collagen sponges, extruded collagen fibres, isoelectric focused collagen fibres, electro-spun polymeric fibres and imprinted polymeric substrates are {{at the forefront of}} scientific and technological research and innovation. Herein, we ventured to assess whether onestep functionalisation of electro-spun fibres with nano / micro particles is possible and whether anisotropic imprinted substrates can maintain tenogenic phenotype in vitro and promote functional neotissue formation in vivo. Starting with electro-spinning, mechanical evaluation demonstrated that aligned <b>orientated</b> electro-spun <b>fibres</b> exhibited significant higher stress at break values than their random aligned counterparts and random <b>orientated</b> electro-spun <b>fibres</b> exhibited significant higher strain at break values than the aligned orientated scaffolds. While maintaining fibre structure, a co-deposition method of spraying and electro-spinning was developed that enabled the incorporation of microspheres within the threedimensional structure of the scaffold. Of significant importance is that bovine tenocytes aligned perpendicular to the fibre orientation, possibly due to the absence of mechanical tension. With respect to imprinting, it is still unclear whether surface topography can be translated into a clinically functional response in vivo at the tissue / device interface. Herein, we demonstrated that anisotropic substrates with groove depth of ~ 317 nm and ~ 1988 nm promoted human tenocyte alignment parallel to underlined topography XVII in vitro. However, none of the topographies assessed (~ 37 nm, ~ 317 nm and ~ 1988 nm groove depth) induced parallel to the substrate cellular orientation in a subcutaneous model and none of the topographies promoted directional tenogenesis in vivo. Further, the rigid poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) substrate used induced transdifferentiation towards chondrogenic / osteogenic lineage, as evidenced by gene analysis. Collectively, these data indicate that two-dimensional imprinting technologies are useful tools for in vitro cell phenotype maintenance, rather than for directional neotissue formation, should multifactorial approaches that consider both surface topography and substrate rigidity are established. Overall, both electro-spinning and imprinting technologies show great promise for tendon repair and regeneration. Imprinting could be the ideal technology for cell phenotype maintenance in vitro, as we can closely control architectural features. Although it was not investigated here, electro-spinning is the ideal technology for in vivo positive outcomes, as the three-dimensional architecture would allow directional tissue formation within the fibrous construct...|$|R
40|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} {{and determination}} of optical anisotropy show that collagen fibres in pig and human lumbar interspinous ligaments {{tend to be}} orientated parallel to the spinous processes. There is a distribution of fibre orientations about this preferred direction. Flexion of the spine {{does not change the}} direction of preferred orientation but the angular spread of fibres increases. This pattern of collagen fibre orientations is consistent with the interspinous ligaments being able to transmit tension from the thoracolumbar fascia to the vertebrae. Since the collagen fibres tend to be aligned antero-posteriorly, they provide a high efficiency of reinforcement in this direction. The lack of <b>fibres</b> <b>orientated</b> perpendicular to the spinous processes will lead to low strength in the cranio-caudal direction so that the ligament can provide little resistance to flexion of the spine...|$|R

The anisotropic behaviour of through-air bonded structures is demonstrated through theoretical stress-strain curves and the relationship between the fibre re-orientation and fabric strain is also analysed.

Together with the experimental evaluation of the mechanical characteristics of the tissue, the development of constitutive models capable of describing its response under general conditions is important. In fact, this is a mandatory step to develop numerical analyses which help in investigating complex phenomena {{that are at the}} basis of the role of PDL, representing a valid tool for interpreting clinical applications. The authors have proposed different constitutive models to describe the non-linear response of PDL considering non-linear elastic behaviour, visco-elastic response and possible damage phenomena due to relevant strains. The visco-elastic model adopted was limited to the assumption of linear viscosity, considering a suitable set of constant relaxation times and relative stiffness parameters. In this work the possible nature of nonlinear visco-elasticity of the PDL is considered, in particular focusing the attention to experimental data taken from relaxation tests on samples of animal model PDL. A non-linear visco-elastic constitutive model is developed {{on the basis of the}} theory of the fibre-reinforced continua, in order to define also the anisotropic response of the PDL due to the presence of highly <b>orientated</b> collagen <b>fibres</b> in the tissue.

The FRP, which can be in the form of pultruded plates or applied in the wet lay-up procedure, acts as external FRP stirrups resisting vertical shear {{in the same way as}} the conventional internal steel stirrups. However, internal steel stirrups are ductile as they are both fully anchored and can yield, which is in contrast to external FRP stirrups that can debond in a brittle fashion and do not yield. Hence, there is no guarantee that the peak vertical shear forces that can be resisted by the steel stirrups and by the transverse FRP plates coincide.

The project was in collaboration with Notts Sports Ltd. who wished to compare the performance of existing pitches with potential new, improved artificial sports turfs. The various materials (from different manufacturers, and of differing pile yarn weight and worn in situ and new) were imaged by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy to assess the tribological behaviour of the artificial sports turfs. X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was used to assess the structure of the artificial sports turfs. Pin on disk wear testing, tensile and fatigue testing was conducted on the artificial sports turfs to assess the wear life/mechanisms and how the structure performs under loading. Optical and scanning electron microscopy reveal the wear mechanisms can be identified by the damage incurred as either adhesive, or abrasive or both. Additionally a directionality in the mechanical properties of the materials was observed. Visual and structural investigation by X-ray CT revealed a directionality to the materials. X-ray CT also showed inconsistencies in the structure negatively affect the performance of the artificial sports turfs, which was seen to be the case with some tensile and fatigue experiments. MRI was explored but found not useful in assessing the structure of the artificial sports turfs. Wear testing showed different behaviour for differing artificial sports turfs, whilst the tensile and fatigue testing showed the orientation of the samples affects these properties, in that the horizontal orientation was stronger than vertical orientation. Tensile testing revealed the artificial sports turfs behave similarly to randomly <b>orientated</b> short <b>fibre</b> composites.

The aim of this study is to fully explore Small Angle Light Scattering (SALS) as a means to non-destructively assess collagen fibre architecture in arterial tissue and subsequently gain insights into load induced reorientation. The optimised configuration of the SALS system for arterial tissue was determined using quantitative comparisons to histological analyses of porcine carotid artery as its basis. Once established, layer specific fibre orientation and the influence of tissue loading was determined for thin sections of carotid artery using SALS. This process was subsequently repeated for intact carotid artery layers. A single family of circumferentially <b>orientated</b> collagen <b>fibres</b> were found in the intima ((- 0. 1 ? 1. 4 ?

An increase in fibre alignment in response to a 20 % circumferential strain was also identified using SALS, characterised by an increase in scattered light eccentricity.

Slump ranging from 80 mm to 200 mm was employed as the parameter to reflect the flowability of SFRC. The results showed that an increase of flowability had no influence on the orientation of steel fibres and led to a decrease of sectional uniformity. Steel <b>fibres</b> <b>orientated</b> in the longitudinal direction of higher-flowability SFRC tended to precipitate toward the bottom layer of the specimens. This resulted in much better flexural performance, including flexural toughness and fracture energy. Analysis of the data suggested that instead of studying the whole cross-section, the distribution rate and distribution coefficient of steel fibres in the tensile zone of specimens should be considered as the main factor determining flexural performance of SFRC. Calculations for bending stiffness and flexural stress based on the distribution rate of high-flowability SFRC are recommended.

In the controls long axis shortening significantly preceded minor axis shortening (mean (1 SD) difference 25 (40) ms) so that the minor axis increased more during isovolumic contraction (0. 25 v 0. 09 cm), indicating that the left ventricle became more spherical. Changes in the long and short axes were synchronous at end ejection and in early diastole in the controls. Epicardial excursion preceded endocardial excursion by 50 (20) ms at its peak. These time relations were consistently disturbed in all patient groups, irrespective {{of the extent of}} fractional shortening of the minor axis. The onset of long axis shortening was delayed, and this was often associated with premature shortening of the minor axis, the normal spherical shape change during isovolumic contraction was lost, and peak epicardial and endocardial changes became more synchronous. In patients with coronary disease these changes are the expected consequence of ischaemic injury to longitudinally <b>orientated</b> subendocardial <b>fibres.</b> In left ventricular hypertrophy their presence consistently showed systolic dysfunction when orthodox measures were still normal. They were more pronounced after mitral valve replacement when the papillary muscles had been sectioned; long axis shortening was reduced during systole and prolonged into early diastole, while normal shortening of the minor axis was maintained only by abnormal epicardial excursion. Relations between long and short axis motion in healthy individuals are characteristic, and their loss is an early index of systolic ventricular disease. These disturbances precede changes in orthodox measures such as fractional shortening or peak velocity of circumferential fibre shortening...|$|R

Mesh <b>fibres</b> <b>orientated</b> at or close to right angles to the lid margin were thicker and denser than the transverse and oblique fibres linking them. The elastic lamina was most substantial in the marginal conjunctiva bridging the interval between the tarsal plate and the mucocutaneous junction where it terminated abruptly.

Dense collagen bundles enclosed the lamina, infiltrating the mesh spaces and attaching the lamina firmly to the tarsal plate. In the marginal zone thick elastic fibres branched forward from the lamina in a brush-like fashion penetrating the relatively soft marginal eyelid tissue obliquely between tarsal gland ducts, while other finer, more numerous fibrils passed backwards attaching the lamina to the basement membrane of the epithelium.

Chemical properties of the resulting composites were evaluated by FTIR and physical properties by SEM. Tensile mechanical testing was carried out on all electrospun scaffolds. MLO-A 5 osteoblastic mouse cells and human embryonic mesenchymal progenitor cells, hES-MPs were seeded on the scaffolds to test their biocompatibility and ability to support mineralised matrix production over a 28 day culture period. Cell viability was assayed by MTT and calcium and collagen deposition by Sirius red and alizarin red respectively. SEM images of both electrospun PU scaffolds and PU–HA composite scaffolds showed differences in fibre morphology with changes in solvent combinations and size of HA particles. Inclusion of THF eliminated the presence of beads in fibres that were present in scaffolds fabricated with 100 % DMF solvent, and resulted in fibres with a more uniform morphology and thicker diameters. Mechanical testing demonstrated that the Young׳s Modulus and yield strength was lower at higher THF concentrations. Inclusion of both sizes of HA particles in PU–HA solutions reinforced the scaffolds leading to higher mechanical properties, whilst FTIR characterisation confirmed the presence of HA in all composite scaffolds. Although all scaffolds supported proliferation of both cell types and deposition of calcified matrix, PU–HA composite fibres containing nano-HA enabled the highest cell viability and collagen deposition.

The shadow-sensors {{were designed to}} detect ‘Violin-Mode’ (VM) resonances in the 0. 4 mm diameter silica fibre suspensions of the test-masses / mirrors of advanced LIGO gravitational wave interferometers. Each sensor illuminated the fibre under test, so as to cast its narrow shadow onto a ‘synthesized split photodiode’ detector, the shadow falling over adjacent edges of the paired photodiodes. The apparatus described here translated a vertically <b>orientated</b> silica test <b>fibre</b> horizontally through a collimated Near InfraRed illuminating beam, whilst simultaneously capturing the separate DC ‘shadow notch’ outputs {{from each of the}} paired split photodiode detectors. As the ratio of AC to DC photocurrent sensitivities to displacement was known, a calibration of the DC response to quasi-static shadow displacement allowed the required AC sensitivity to vibrational displacement to be found. Special techniques are described for generating the required constant scan-rate for the test-fibre using a DC motor-driven stage, for removing ‘jitter’ at such low translation rates from a linear magnetic encoder, and so for capturing the two shadow-notch signals at each micrometre of the test-fibre’s travel. Calibration, across the four detectors of this work, gave a vibrational responsivity in voltage terms of (9. 45 ± 1. 20) MV (rms) / metre (rms), yielding a VM displacement sensitivity of (69 ± 13) picometres (rms) / √Hz, at 500 Hz, over the required measuring span of ± 0. 1 mm...|$|R
40|$|In {{modern times}} {{there has been}} a growing focus towards {{environmental}} awareness and sustainability which has entered the fibre composite industry. This attitude has seen an emergence in the occurrence of environmentally friendly, sustainable materials. Traditional synthetic composites are predominately constructed from petro-chemical based resins and synthetic fibres. These traditional petro-chemical based composites have benefited society in many different ways. Recently there has been increasing concerns over the finite nature and the unsustainably of these resources. A genuine concern is the increase of costs as the availability of the resource reduces. There is a requirement to find a sustainable replacement material for use in industry, and this is where natural fibre composites are being positioned. This project has compared natural fibre composites made from epoxidized vegetable oils and hemp fibres with traditional glass fibre composites through the investigation of mechanical and thermal properties. An understanding of the benefits of making the composites has been gained throughout this project. Traditional glass fibre composites were manufactured using the hand layup technique and the microstructure, thermal and mechanical properties were characterised through flexural tests, impact tests, DMA and microscopic analysis. Natural fibre composites were manufactured from different types of hemp fibre (short bleached and raw long) and different types and quantities of EVO using randomly <b>orientated</b> short hemp <b>fibres</b> and also unidirectional hand laid hemp fibres. The effects of fibre content and alkali treatment of the hemp fibre were analysed through mechanical, thermal and microscopic analysis. Natural fibre composites were compared with traditional glass fibre composites through mechanical, thermal and microscopic analysis. This study has confirmed the ability of natural fibres and plant-oil based resins as feasible resources from which to manufacture fibre composites. Improvements were realised through the use of alkali treatment of the fibres. In terms of cost and specific material properties, natural composites represent an alternative to traditional synthetic fibre composites in certain application...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of load-bearing osseous implant with desired mechanical and surface properties {{in order to}} promote incorporation with bone and to eliminate risk of bone resorption and implant failure is a very challenging task. Bone formation and resoption processes depend on the mechanical environment. Certain stress/strain conditions are required to promote new bone growth and to prevent bone mass loss. Conventional metallic implants with high stiffness carry most of the load and the surrounding bone becomes virtually unloaded and inactive. Fibre-reinforced composites offer an interesting alternative to metallic implants, because their mechanical properties can be tailored to be equal to those of bone, by the careful selection of matrix polymer, type of fibres, fibre volume fraction, orientation and length. Successful load transfer at bone-implant interface requires proper fixation between the bone and implant. One promising method to promote fixation is to prepare implants with porous surface. Bone ingrowth into porous surface structure stabilises the system and improves clinical success of the implant. The experimental part of this work was focused on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) -based composites with dense load-bearing core and porous surface. Three-dimensionally randomly <b>orientated</b> chopped glass <b>fibres</b> were used to reinforce the composite. A method to fabricate those composites was developed by a solvent treatment technique and some characterisations concerning the functionality of the surface structure were made in vitro and in vivo. Scanning electron microscope observations revealed that the pore size and interconnective porous architecture of the surface layer of the fibre-reinforced composite (FRC) could be optimal for bone ingrowth. Microhardness measurements showed that the solvent treatment did not {{have an effect on the}} mechanical properties of the load-bearing core. A push-out test, using dental stone as a bone model material, revealed that short glass fibre-reinforced porous surface layer is strong enough to carry load. Unreacted monomers can cause the chemical necrosis of the tissue, but the levels of leachable resisidual monomers were considerably lower than those found in chemically cured fibre-reinforced dentures and in modified acrylic bone cements. Animal experiments proved that surface porous FRC implant can enhance fixation between bone and FRC. New bone ingrowth into the pores was detected and strong interlocking between bone and the implant was achieved...|$|R
40|$|The {{engineering}} of {{skeletal muscle}} requires platforms that facilitate the proliferation {{and maintenance of}} primary muscle stem cells (myoblasts) and muscle fibre maturation {{in a manner that}} reflects native muscle structure. We have been investigating the use of nanostructured conducting polymer surfaces for the orientation and electrical stimulation of cells and tissues and have developed a hybrid conducting polymer and carbon nanotube plaform, suitable for ex vivo muscle growth, differentiation and electrical stimulation. In this study, Carbon nanotube fibres were laid down in parallel on gold coated mylar. Layers of polypyrrole (doped with pTS) were galvinostatically grown over the carbon nanotube fibre mats to create a nanostructured polypyrrole surface. Myoblasts extracted from 8 &# 8201;week old mice were seeded onto polymer platforms and induced to differentiate into myotubes. Analysis of myofibre differentiation and orientation was then performed. In addition, total RNA was harvested from myotubes that had undergone bipolar electrical stimulation on the platforms 8 hours a day, for 3 &# 8201;days. Whole genome arrays (Codelink) were then used to assess gene expression changes in the electrically stimulated myotubes. Platforms were developed to encourage the alignment and differentiation of skeletal muscle stem cells (myoblasts) to reflect the orientation of mature skeletal muscle. Nanostructured platforms were created by orientation of carbon nanotube fibres on a conducting gold mylar surface, over which a layers of conductive polypyrrole were deposited. Human and murine myoblasts could be grown and differentiated on these platforms without the use of cell adhesion molecules. A significant increase in myotube orientation was seen on nanostructured surfaces, i. e. polypyrrole films with an underlying layer of <b>orientated</b> carbon nanotube <b>fibres.</b> This orientation decreased with increasing thickness of the polypyrrole, suggesting a strong influence of the nanostructure on the orientation of myofibres. In addition, a significant number of gene expression changes were detected in myofibres electrically stimulated on the platforms. A number of these genes were associated with muscle differentiation and myoblast fusion, demonstrating that these platforms can be used to influence the differentiation state of skeletal myoblasts through electrical stimulation. These studies demonstrate that novel hybrid platforms can be used to influence skeletal muscle differentiation ex vivo, through electrical stimulation. In addition these platforms can influence muscle fibre orientation in a manner reflecting the in vivo architecture of the parent tissue. Such platforms have application for controlling the regeneration of skeletal muscle in vivo and for the integration of bionic devices designed to facilitate muscle regeneration and function...|$|R
40|$|Summary Tissue {{engineering}} and regenerative medicine strategies until now have mostly relied on static culture using chemical stimulation to induce cell differentiation. However, these strategies neglect the dynamic {{environment in which}} cells reside in the body where they are surrounded by a chemically and physically well-defined threedimensional (3 D) topography. Not only does this environment control cellular differentiation, but its structure also determines the mechanical function of that tissue. Alongside physical cues, external mechanical forces play {{an essential role in}} the homeostasis of many tissues, particularly bone. In order to develop tissue engineered constructs that are suitable for implantation, it may be important to incorporate these essential cues into pre-culture methods and in order to do this, {{a better understanding of the}} cellular responses is required. The main aim of this research was to understand how physical and mechanical cues affect cell behaviour, differentiation and matrix production, with particular emphasis on osteogenesis and collagen organisation. In order to achieve this, electrospun scaffolds were fabricated with controllable fibre orientation for studies involving fibroblast matrix organisation, and the affect on the differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells. Short bouts of tensile loading were conducted using a previously established bioreactor model for conditioning collagen-producing cells. A simple rocking platform method for subjecting cells to fluid-flow was also investigated for its potential to enhance osteogenesis and collagen organisation. This system was further used to study the role of the primary cilium for the mechanotransduction of bone cells. The overall goal was to understand how to manipulate cell differentiation and matrix production in order to develop a more suitable construct with correct tissue structure in a rapid manner. Monitoring of the major structural matrix protein collagen was achieved using the minimally-invasive technique of second harmonic generation, which was optimised. Electrospun scaffolds with a random architecture caused cells to deposit matrix in a similar random manner, however highly aligned scaffolds caused deposited collagen to <b>orientate</b> in the <b>fibre</b> direction giving superior tensile properties. Further to this, random fibres appeared to be more favourable for the differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells than highly aligned substrates. 9 Short bouts of tensile stimulation of collagen producing cells on 3 D substrates caused an increase in collagen deposition. Another stimulation method, a simple rocking platform, created oscillatory fluid shear stress (FSS) suitable for stimulation of osteogenic cells and enhanced collagen organisation. Further to this, human dermal fibroblasts could be induced to form a mineralised matrix when cultured in osteogenic media, which was further enhanced with FSS. It was also demonstrated that this simple rocking system could be used to test a wide variety of loading parameters. Finally, rocking was used to examine the role of the primary cilium in the load-induced mineral deposition response of bone cells. When mature bone cells were subjected to FSS, primary cilia shortened in length and removal of primary cilia resulted in loss of the load-induced matrix response suggesting that primary cilia are mechanosensors in bone cells...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to improve the utility of hollow fibre bioreactors (HFB) {{for the growth of}} {{clinically}} applicable cell populations by improving initial rates of cell attachment using a novel dynamic seeding methods, and to investigate their use as a novel cell encapsulation device for the delivery of cell therapies to infarcted heart tissue. Cardiac cell therapies starting are traditionally administered by direct injection or intravenous infusion to a target area in the heart. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have shown promise as a cell therapy and can be isolated from a patient’s adipose tissue surrounding the heart, allowing 812, 800 ± 318, 400 cells to be harvested; however this population requires expansion to a minimum of 50 million cells to be an effective traditionally administered dose in humans. Hollow fibre bioreactors have shown to offer the highest rates of MSC growth compared to other bioreactor designs, owing to their large surface area to volume ratio and their ability to provide the cells with a low shear environment that can emulate in vivo conditions. However, a concern with using HFBs is the relatively low rates of initial cell attachment, with authors observing rates around 20 %. At this rate of attachment and with an initial population of 812, 800 ± 318, 400 cells, it would take 12. 6 ± 5. 2 days to grow 50 million MSCs in a HFB. For use as a medical intervention the MSCs must be grown as soon as possible, and to ensure this the efficiency of cell seeding on the external hollow fibre surface must be as high as possible. In an attempt to improve rates of initial cell attachment Chapter 4 illustrated how dynamic seeding can allow additional opportunities for a given cell to make contact with hollow fibres contained in a bioreactor. MG 63 human osteosarcoma cells were used as an alternative cell type due to their lower cost and increased resilience over a greater number of passages. Static horizontal seeding of MG 63 cells on single fibre bioreactors provided 18 % ± 16 % cell attachment confirming values found in literature, however dynamic attachment on horizontally <b>orientated</b> multi <b>fibre</b> bioreactors rotating at 6 RPM offered improved attachment of 39 % ± 12 %, double the rate of static attachment. At this improved rate of cell attachment, it would now take 11. 2 ± 4. 7 days to grow 50 million cells, 1. 4 days quicker than before. This novel approach to HFB seeding will lead to quicker administration of medical treatments for patients. While traditional delivery methods have shown to improve heart function, the active dose retained at the wound site is around 2 %, much lower than that actually administered. Cells can be ejected from the insertion site due to heart contractions, and doses contained in the bloodstream become highly diluted. Engineered alternatives include cellular sheets, cell-loaded sutures, and cell encapsulation within hydrogels. However, each of these have their own inherent limitations, with cellular sheets demonstrating poor rates of migration into infarct site, cells on suture surfaces shearing away when sown into a wound site, and cells in hydrogels suffering from poor initial rates of engraftment. Hollow fibres made from poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) were further investigated for use as an engineered cell delivery vector, with cells seeded within the hollow fibre lumen, allowing cells to be protected during implantation, biodegrade, and provide a concentrated cell dose at a wound site. Hollow fibre scaffolds have been used as a delivery device for encapsulation of pharmaceuticals, but never for encapsulation of cells in this manner. Chapter 5 investigates the development of a hollow fibre with internal and external surface porosity, which allowed passive permeation of liquid through its structure {{from one side to the}} other. Manufacturing a hollow fibre using NaCl porogen at 60 % the weight of PLGA resulted in pores 4 – 6 μm in diameter, which provided the desired liquid permeation characteristics and a flux of 6. 6 m 3 m- 2 h- 1 bar- 1 (± 77 %). Chapter 6 sought to encapsulate a population of MG 63 cells within the lumen of the hollow fibre, fed by permeation of media flowing in the extracapillary space (ECS), and investigate the viability of cells over a 6 day time course. Studies revealed that the cells became non-viable after 24 hours as a result of poor rates of dissolved oxygen permeation. Subsequent modelling of the system showed that an increased ECS flow rate of a 1. 49 mL/min should provide sufficient dissolved oxygen to sustain a population of 100, 000 cells in this system. This work demonstrates a vital first step in exploring a potential evolution in cell delivery, with further investigation required to fully explore the viability of hollow fibre devices for cell encapsulation...|$|R
40|$|Fourier transfonn (FT) Raman, Raman {{microspectroscopy}} and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy {{have been}} used for the structural analysis and characterisation of untreated and chemically treated wool fibres. For FT -Raman spectroscopy novel methods of sample presentation have been developed and optimised for the analysis of wool. No significant fluorescence was observed and the spectra could be obtained routinely. The stability of wool keratin to the laser source was investigated and the visual and spectroscopic signs of sample damage were established. Wool keratin was found to be extremely robust with no signs of sample degradation observed for laser powers of up to 600 m W and for exposure times of up to seven and half hours. Due to improvements in band resolution and signal-to-noise ratio, several previously unobserved spectral features have become apparent. The assignment of the Raman active vibrational modes of wool have been reviewed and updated to include these features. The infrared spectroscopic techniques of attenuated total reflectance (ATR) and photoacoustic (P A) {{have been used}} to examine shrinkproofed and mothproofed wool samples. Shrinkproofing is an oxidative chemical treatment used to selectively modifY the surface of a wool fibre. Mothproofing is a chemical treatment applied to wool for the prevention of insect attack. The ability of PAS and A TR to vary the penetration depth by varying certain instrumental parameters was used to obtain spectra of the near surface regions of these chemically treated samples. These spectra were compared with those taken with a greater penetration depth, which therefore represent more of the bulk wool sample. The PA and ATR spectra demonstrated that oxidation was restricted to the near-surface layer of wool. Extensive curve fitting of ATR spectra of untreated wool indicated that cuticle was composed of a mixed protein conformation, but was predominately that of an a. -helix. The cortex was proposed to be a mixture of both a. helical and -pleated sheet protein conformations. These findings were supported by PAS depth profiling results. Raman microspectroscopy was used in an extensive investigation of the molecular structure of the wool fibre. This included determining the orientation of certain functional groups within the wool fibre and the symmetry of particular vibrations. The orientation ofbonds within the wool fibre was investigated by <b>orientating</b> the wool <b>fibre</b> axis parallel and then perpendicular to the plane of polarisation of the electric vector of the incident radiation. It was experimentally determined that the majority of C=O and N-H bonds of the peptide bond of wool lie parallel to the fibre axis. Additionally, a number of the important vibrations associated with the a-helix were also found to lie parallel to the fibre axis. Further investigation into the molecular structure of wool involved determining what effect stretching the wool fibre had on bond orientation. Raman spectra of stretched and unstretched wool fibres indicated that extension altered the orientation ofthe aromatic rings, the CH 2 and CH 3 groups of the amino acids. Curve fitting results revealed that extension resulted in significant destruction of the a-helix structure a substantial increase in the P-pleated sheet structure. Finally, depolarisation ratios were calculated for Raman spectra. The vibrations associated with the aromatic rings of amino acids had very low ratios which indicated that the vibrations were highly symmetrical...|$|R
40|$|Adhesive organs enable insects to {{reversibly}} {{adhere to}} substrates even during rapid locomotion. In this process {{a very fast}} but reliable change of adhesion and detachment is realised. These abilities had aroused high interest by scientists many years ago, trying to create artificial reusable adhesion devices. Within the frame of this thesis the detailed structures and the functionalites of the adhesive organs of the stick insect Carausius morosus were analysed {{and based on the}} obtained data artificial adhesion devices were constructed and finally validated. Initially, the morphology and the ultrastructure of the adhesive organs was analysed using SEM, TEM, CLSM, micro-CT, FIB and light microscopy. By these analyses the detailed ultrastructure of the smooth adhesive organs of stick insects, the so called arolia, and of the hairy adhesive organs, the so called euplantulae, could be revealed. Especially, new insights into the structure of the treelike branching fibres within the procuticula were obtained, which support the thin membranous epicuticula by which arolia are covered. Presumably, this very thin epicuticula can conform to the smallest surface roughnesses and the treelike branching fibres support the epicuticula without preventing its flexibility. Due to this design smooth adhesive organs most likely can conform to substrates so close, that adhesion forces on the basis of van der Waals forces were developed. Several further issues concerning the adhesion of stick insects were analysed {{in the course of this}} thesis. Among others the development of a new method for the determination of the Young´s modulus of thin and superficial membranes enabled to determine the Young´s modulus of the epicuticula. In this method arolia of stick insects adhering upside down to a latex membrane were stretched by stretching the latex membrane. Meanwhile, the elongation of the contact area between the arolium and the latex membrane was recorded. The observed elongations were analysed using finite element simulations yielding Young´s moduli of about 60 MPa. This value is much higher than the values determined or assumed for the epicuticula of adhesive organs before. Based on all results four construction plans for the fabrication of artificial adhesion devices were developed. All construction plans contained an outer, thin, flexible and adhesive membrane out of a silicone, which was supported by different resilient substructures. In the first adhesion device the substructure consisted of a silicone foam and in the second adhesion device the substructure was formed by an array of parallel <b>fibres,</b> <b>orientated</b> at an angle of 57 deg. The third adhesion device included thin flock <b>fibres,</b> which were <b>orientated</b> about perpendicularly to the adhesive surface of the adhesion device and which were infused with a very elastical silicone gel. In the fourth adhesion device the substructure was solely made out of the same elastic silicone gel, which found a use in the third adhesion device. During the course of this thesis the constructional ideas how to fabricate artificial adhesion devices were submitted to the Deutsches Patent- und Markenamt. Among the four adhesion devices the one with flock fibres showed the highest adhesion force of about 1. 25 N/sq cm, which is a bit higher than the adhesion force of stick insects without the contribution of friction. This high adhesion force seems to be based on the reinforcement of the adhesion device with fibres, by which pulling forces are uniformly transferred to the contact area of the adhesion device to the substrate. A non-uniform loading of the contact area easily leads to a local detachment at the area of the highest loading, which could lead to a gradual detachment of the whole adhesion device. Such a gradual detachment goes along with small adhesion forces. Taking into account all results, a new construction plan for the fabrication of artificial adhesion devices was developed. According to this plan adhesion devices should be covered with a preferably thin membrane with a high Young´s modulus. This membrane should be supported by a substructure made of a resilient and elastic foam or gel. Besides, the substructure should be reinforced by very thin fibres, which equip the adhesion devices with a high tensile strength without reducing the resiliency of the substructure. Biomimetic adhesion devices fabricated according to this construction plan should show high adhesion forces as well as high resistances against abrasion and contamination...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this thesis}} were to: 1) {{develop a new}} method for the {{determination}} of interstitial pH at rest and during exercise in vivo, 2) systematically explore the effects of different ingestion regimes of 300 mg. kg- 1 sodium citrate on blood and urine pH at rest, and 3) to combine the new interstitial pH technique {{with the findings of}} the second investigation in an attempt to provide a greater understanding of H+ movement between the extracellular compartments. The purpose of the first study was to develop a method for the continuous measurement of interstitial pH in vastus lateralis was successfully developed using microdialysis and 2, 7 -bis-(2 -carboxyethyl) - 5 -(and- 6) -carboxyfluorescein (BCECF). To avoid the presence of an artificial alkalosis during exercise, it was necessary to add 25 mM HCO 3 - to the perfusate. The outlet of the probe was cut less than 10 mm from the skin and connected to a stainless steel tube completing the circuit to a microflow-through cuvette (8 fÝl) within a fluorescence spectrophotometer. This prevented the loss of carbon dioxide from the dialysate and any subsequent pH artefact. Interstitial pH was collected from six subjects before, during and after five minutes of knee-extensor exercise at three intensities 30, 50, and 70 W. Mean,,bSEM interstitial pH at rest was 7. 38,,b 0. 02. Exercise reduced interstitial pH in an almost linear fashion. The nadir value for interstitial pH at 30, 50 and 70 W exercise was 7. 27, 7. 16 and 7. 04, respectively. The lowest pH was obtained 1 min after exercise, irrespective of workload, after which the interstitial pH recovered in a nearly exponential manner. The mean half time of interstitial recovery was 5. 2 min. The changes in interstitial pH exceeded the changes in venous blood pH. This study demonstrated that interstitial pH can be measured using microdialysis and that it is continuously decreased during muscle activity. The purpose of the second study was to establish an optimal ingestion regime for the ingestion of 300 mg. kg- 1 of sodium citrate and maximise the alkalotic effect while minimising any side effects. Increasing the effectiveness of alkali ingestion may lead to further increases in muscle performance. Ingesting 300 mg. kg- 1 sodium citrate at a rate of 300 mg. min- 1 was identified as the optimal ingestion regime to maximise alkalosis at rest, which occurred 3. 5 h post-ingestion. This was determined by monitoring eight human subjects ingesting 300 mg. kg- 1 sodium citrate at five different rates, control (no ingestant), bolus, 300, 600 and 900 mg. kg. min- 1 on five days separated by at least 48 hours. Sodium citrate was ingested in capsule form with water ad libitum, with the exception of bolus, which was combined with 400 ml less than 25 percent orange juice and consumed in less than 1 min. Arterialised blood (mean 71. 3,,b 3. 5 mmHg) acid-base and electrolyte status was assessed via the withdrawal of ~ 5 ml of blood every 30 min across an eight hour duration, placed on ice and analysed within five minutes. No alkalotic difference was found between ingestion rates (mean 7. 445,,b 0. 004, 7. 438,,b 0. 004 and 7. 442,,b 0. 004 for 300, 600 and 900 mg. min- 1, respectively). All experimental ingestion regimes were associated with elevations in [HCO 3 -] (29. 6, 29. 7, 29. 8, 29. 9 and 26. 3 mmol. l- 1 for bolus, 300, 600, 900 and control, respectively). The 300 ingestion regime had the greatest impact on [H+], a 0. 66 meq. l- 1,,e 10 - 8 change. Bolus ingestion (3. 93,,b 0. 08 mmol. l- 1) of sodium citrate had no effect on control (4. 06,,b 0. 08 mmol. l- 1) blood [K+], however, 300 mg. min- 1 decreased blood [K+] (p less than 0. 05). There was no effect of sodium citrate on blood [Cl-], but after 2. 5 h blood [Cl-] was lower than pre-ingestion values (p less than 0. 05). All ingestion rates of sodium citrate increased (p less than 0. 05) urine pH above control. This is the first study to investigate the effect of varying ingestion rates on acid-base status at rest in humans. The results suggest that ingesting sodium citrate in small doses in quick succession induce a greater blood alkalosis than the commonly practised bolus protocol. Using the interstitial pH technique described above and the optimal ingestion regime (300 mg. min- 1) identified above, the final experiment was designed to assess the influence of sodium citrate ingestion on interstitial pH at both rest and during exercise. Five subjects ingested 300 mg. kg- 1 sodium citrate at 300 mg. min- 1 again in capsule form with water ad libitum. Prior to ingestion, each subject had a cannula placed into their cephalic vein and one microdialysis probe (CMA- 60) inserted into their left thigh, <b>orientated</b> along the <b>fibres</b> of vastus lateralus. This probe was used for the measurement of pH as described above. At the end of this period, an exercise protocol required five subjects to perform light exercise (10 W) for 10 min, before starting an intense exercise period (~ 90 - 95 % leg VO 2 peak) to exhaustion followed by a 15 min recovery period. Dialysate and blood samples were collected across all periods. Mean,,bSEM interstitial pH for placebo and alkalosis were 7. 38,,b 0. 12 and 7. 24,,b 0. 16, respectively. Sodium citrate ingestion was not associated with an interstitial alkalosis. An exercise induced acidosis was observed in the interstitium during placebo but not during alkalosis (p less than 0. 05). Mean,,bSEM venous pH were 7. 362,,b 0. 003 and 7. 398,,b 0. 003 for placebo and alkalosis, respectively. Sodium citrate ingestion was not associated with a venous alkalosis. Sodium citrate ingestion was associated with an increase in mean,,bSEM venous [HCO 3 -] (placebo 25. 5,,b 0. 2, alkalosis 28. 1,,b 0. 2). This increase in the blood bicarbonate buffer system was not associated with an increase in time to exhaustion (placebo 352,,b 71, alkalosis 415,,b 171). This was the first study to investigate the effects of sodium citrate ingestion on interstitial pH. The results of this study demonstrated that an interstitial alkalosis does not ensue after alkali ingestion, however, it was associated with the lack of an exercise induced acidosis suggesting an improved pH regulation during exercise...|$|R
