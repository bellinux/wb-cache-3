This paper {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} a Parameterised Search System (PSS), which allows flexibility in user queries, and, more importantly, allows system engineers to easily define customised search strategies.

These specifications should stay {{as close as possible to}} the problem definition (i. e., the retrieval model to be used in the search application), abstracting away the details of the physical <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> and content.

40|$|The work {{focuses on}} the {{description}} of the polysemy of a range of English spatial particles in a contrastive perspective with Italian. This area has always proved to be quite problematic, and the complexities of the cross-linguistic mapping have traditionally been dealt with via arbitrary accounts of correspondences and divergences. In fact, since Brugman and Lakoff’s ground-breaking work on the polysemy of over in the 80 s, there have been increasing attempts in the cognitive linguistics literature to account for the different meanings of these particles in a motivated way capable of translating into psychologically plausible descriptions. However, as far as spatial particles are concerned, the main trends in the actual practice of the teaching of English as a foreign language to Italians are still largely based on idiosyncratic listings of examples. 	 The major contribution to theoretical and applied contrastive research of the present study rests on the cognitively grounded rationale (Lexical Complexity, cf. Bertuccelli Papi and Lenci 2007) underlying the <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>data,</b> which attempts to overcome the limits of a chaotic view and correlated arbitrary cross-linguistic accounts of the phenomenon in question. This logic is here conceived as an overarching paradigm explicitly applied to a cognitively realistic theory of lexical representation (Principled Polysemy Networks, esp. cf. Tyler and Evans 2003). Furthermore, the Lexical Complexity framework proposes a contrastive account of conceptual structure where the <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> is motivated by universal parameters that are assumed to reflect the cognitive organisation of lexical systems within and across languages. Although the details of network expansion cannot be predicted, what, in fact, the proposed organisation can presumably predict is the cognitive complexity involved in the cross-linguistic mapping of particles, and possible ensuing difficulty in learning and translation...|$|E

40|$|English and Italian differ a {{great deal}} in their {{respective}} repertoires of spatial particles (an important subset of which are prepositions), an area which seems to be quite problematic in foreign language learning. Most current EFL textbooks and didactic grammars tend to provide partial and idiosyncratic cross-linguistic descriptions of such items, while the majority of dictionaries' accounts are grounded in an alphabetical order. This article contributes to the field of research on Cognitive Linguistics applications to pedagogical grammar (see, e. g., Tyler and Evans 2004, Evans and Tyler 2005, Boers et al. (eds) 2010) by proposing a motivated, cognitively grounded contrastive account of particles in English and Italian which ideally addresses the needs of pedagogy professionals as well as of advanced Italian learners of English. The proposal draws on Tyler and Evans's (2003) Principled Polysemy Network model (also see Evans 2010) and applies the rationale of a cognitively oriented view of Lexical Complexity (Bertuccelli Papi and Lenci 2007) to the overall <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>data.</b> Spatial and non-spatial senses of particles of verticality are here focused on, especially those in the lower section of the vertical axis.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} coexistence of 'narrative', popular history, {{which aims to}} tell a story to edify and entertain, with 'structural' history, which gained precedence in the university from the nineteenth century onward. Using the case studies of Simon Schama and Niall Ferguson, popular historians who transitioned from early 'structural' works to 'narrative' books and finally documentary, the precise nature of narrative is examined through the theory of literary historical tropes developed by Hayden White, where a political perspective engages an 'emplotment' where a form of narrative develops. After examining how tropes apply to the life experience, ideology and resulting emplotment of Schama and Ferguson, it looks at the academic criticisms of their narratives, in text and television documentary - namely, that the <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> into a compelling story negates accuracy and objectivity in the name of entertainment. Subsequently, the similarity of Schama and Ferguson's narrative style is compared to pre-academic historical writings from before Leopold von Ranke. The final argument is that the popular history espoused by Schama and Ferguson is a re-emergence of the older, pre-academic style, based on narrative, which predates the structural history which displaced it. This dissertation concludes by examining how the two historiographies might coexist, arguing that the new narrative can offer excitement and purpose to the structural historian, giving relevance to the rigorous work of structural history...|$|E
