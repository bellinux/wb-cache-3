40|$|Parents use {{different}} ways <b>of</b> <b>disciplining</b> {{the children in}} the family. The purpose of the research is to study ways, attitudes and intergenerational relations between disciplining {{the children in the}} family. One hundred and three parents appraised their ways <b>of</b> children <b>disciplining,</b> their attitudes towards the ways <b>of</b> <b>disciplining,</b> the context <b>of</b> experiencing, modes <b>of</b> implementing <b>discipline</b> and ways <b>of</b> <b>disciplining</b> <b>of</b> their mother and father when they were 10 years old. More than half of the parents describe the use of {{at least one of the}} ways of physical punishment respectively, at least one of the ways of psychical violence as a way <b>of</b> <b>disciplining</b> children in the family. Punishment ways <b>of</b> <b>disciplining</b> are connected with the experience of spousal conflict in the family, ineffectiveness, stress and the impulsive way of a response due to children <b>disciplining.</b> The acceptability <b>of</b> punishment and non-punishment ways <b>of</b> <b>disciplining</b> are positively connected with the frequency of use of this ways <b>of</b> <b>disciplining.</b> The research presented here shows a possibility that the use of a certain way <b>of</b> <b>disciplining</b> children in the family does not necessarily have a connection with a similar disciplining experience in the childhood. Corporal punishment is connected with the experience of other ways <b>of</b> punitive <b>disciplining</b> in the childhood, especially with the ways <b>of</b> <b>disciplining</b> used by mother...|$|R

5|$|American {{officers}} serving under Pulaski {{had difficulty}} taking orders from a foreigner who could scarcely speak English and whose ideas <b>of</b> <b>discipline</b> and tactics differed enormously from those {{to which they}} were accustomed. This resulted in friction between the Americans and Pulaski and his fellow Polish officers. There was also discontent in the unit over delays in pay, and Pulaski's imperious personality was a regular source of discontent among his peers, superiors, and subordinates. Pulaski was also unhappy that his suggestion to create a lancer unit was denied. Despite a commendation from Wayne, these circumstances prompted Pulaski to resign his general command in March 1778, and return to Valley Forge.|$|E

5|$|In 1886 {{a colonel}} renowned for lack <b>of</b> <b>discipline</b> {{published}} newspaper articles criticizing the Minister of War, {{an act of}} insubordination forbidden by law. Instead of being punished, the colonel was supported by his commander, Field Marshal (nowadays Divisional General) Deodoro da Fonseca. The minister, {{as well as the}} conservative cabinet headed by João Maurício Wanderley, decided not to penalize the colonel in an attempt to quiet dissention. However, the cabinet went further and removed any constraint on military officers broadcasting their views. In consequence of this policy, subordinates were thenceforth able to publicly criticize their superiors, thus undermining both military and political authority, including that of the cabinet itself.|$|E

5|$|Kosygin {{would prove}} to be a very {{competent}} administrator, with the Soviet standard of living rising considerably due to his moderately reformist policy. Kosygin's moderate 1965 reform, as with Nikita Khrushchev's thaw, radicalised the Soviet reform movement. While Leonid Brezhnev was content to maintain the centralised structure of the Soviet planned economy, Kosygin attempted to revitalise the ailing economic system by decentralising management. Following Brezhnev's death in 1982, the reform movement was split between Yuri Andropov's path <b>of</b> <b>discipline</b> and control and Gorbachev's liberalisation of all aspects of public life.|$|E

5|$|Schreck, a {{founding}} member of the SA and a close confidant of Hitler, became the first SS chief in March 1925. On 15 April 1926, Joseph Berchtold succeeded him as chief of the SS. Berchtold changed the title of the office to Reichsführer-SS (Reich Leader-SS). Berchtold was considered more dynamic than his predecessor, but became increasingly frustrated by the authority the SA had over the SS. This led to him transferring leadership of the SS to his deputy, Erhard Heiden, on 1 March 1927. Under Heiden's leadership, a stricter code <b>of</b> <b>discipline</b> was enforced than would have been tolerated in the SA.|$|E
