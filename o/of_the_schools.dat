5|$|As {{is common}} in Northern Ireland, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> in Lurgan are {{attended}} mainly by children from one or other of the two main ethno-religious blocs, reflecting the existence of deep-seated ethnic, sectarian and political divisions in society. Some schools are in the Catholic 'maintained' sector, i.e. maintained by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, and others are controlled directly by the state. Directly-controlled state schools generally have a predominantly Protestant intake.|$|E

5|$|By the 1850s {{there were}} several {{versions}} of football played in public schools and clubs throughout England. Each school played by their own code despite an attempt by Cambridge University to unify them in 1848. Their rules were generally inaccessible outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools.</b> There the football tended to be unorganised and fairly lawless games known as mob football. Although there are matches between small, equal numbered teams it remained a minority sport until the 1860s.|$|E
5|$|Each of the {{principal}} Upanishads {{can be associated with}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> of exegesis of the four Vedas (shakhas). Many Shakhas are said to have existed, of which only a few remain. The new Upanishads often have little relation to the Vedic corpus and have not been cited or commented upon by any great Vedanta philosopher: their language differs from that of the classic Upanishads, being less subtle and more formalized. As a result, they are not difficult to comprehend for the modern reader.|$|E

5|$|Following the government's {{closure of}} most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> in the 1960s, {{the work of}} Indigenous activists and historians led to greater {{awareness}} by the public of the damage the schools had caused, {{as well as to}} official government and church apologies, and a legal settlement.
