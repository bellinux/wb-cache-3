5000|$|Fome Is Dape is {{the sole}} album from hip-hop duo, Little-T and One Track Mike. It was {{released}} on August 28, 2001 on Lava Records, and it features their <b>one-off</b> <b>hit,</b> [...] "Shaniqua".|$|E
5000|$|BBC Radio has {{described}} [...] "Life on Mars?" [...] as having [...] "one {{of the strangest}} lyrics ever" [...] consisting of a [...] "slew of surreal images" [...] like a Salvador Dalí painting. The line [...] "Look at those cavemen go" [...] is {{a reference to the}} song [...] "Alley Oop", a <b>one-off</b> <b>hit</b> in 1960 for American doo-wop band The Hollywood Argyles.|$|E
50|$|He capitalised on {{his initial}} success with a <b>one-off</b> <b>hit</b> record, a novelty version of The Ugly Duckling {{recorded}} on PYE records. In 1975 it reached number 10 in the BBC Top 50 Singles Chart. In 1975 he also became {{the host of}} the ITV children's TV quiz show Runaround, fondly remembered for its incomprehensible rules and the incongruity of Reid as presenter. Runaround ended in 1981.|$|E
500|$|Prior to 2000, {{only seven}} film series had grossed over $1 billion {{at the box}} office: James Bond, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Rocky, Batman, Jurassic Park and Star Trek. Since {{the turn of the}} century that number has {{increased}} to over fifty (not including <b>one-off</b> <b>hits</b> such as Avatar, Titanic and Frozen). This is partly due to inflation and market growth, but also to Hollywood's adoption of the franchise model: films that have built-in brand recognition, such as being based on a well known literary source or an established character. The methodology is based on the concept that films associated with things audiences are already familiar with can be more effectively marketed to them, and as such are known as [...] "pre-sold" [...] films within the industry.|$|R
5000|$|There {{have been}} a number of novelty records and <b>one-off</b> <b>hits</b> that have {{included}} uncleared samples. The song [...] "Your Woman" [...] by White Town features an uncredited sample from a 1932 song [...] "My Woman" [...] by the Lew Stone Band taken from the soundtrack of the Dennis Potter series Pennies From Heaven. Other notable one-off bootlegs include DNA's dance remix of Suzanne Vega's [...] "Tom's Diner" [...] (1990) and [...] "You Got The Love" [...] by The Source featuring Candi Staton (1991). Vega received quite a few unsolicited mixes of her (a cappella) song, and eventually issued an entire CD of [...] "Tom's Diner" [...] mixes, one notable example being [...] "Jeannie's Diner", in which a resung verse based on Vega's composition describes the premise of the situation comedy [...] "I Dream of Jeannie". [...] "Tom's Diner" [...] is likely to be the first song that was [...] "mash mixed" [...] as we now know the process.|$|R
5000|$|Among {{the most}} famous {{recording}} artists on Laurie's roster were Dion and the Belmonts, The Mystics, The Chiffons, The Jarmels, Bobby Goldsboro, and The Royal Guardsmen. Dion and the Belmonts {{were responsible for the}} first of Laurie's hit singles with their 1958 doo-wop song, [...] "I Wonder Why". Ten years later, the group's lead vocalist, Dion DiMucci (known professionally as Dion), had a solo hit on the label with [...] "Abraham, Martin & John". Another sizable hit for the label was the controversial song [...] "Once You Understand", written and produced by the songwriting team of Lou Stalmman and Bobby Susser and released by the duo in 1971 under the pseudonym Think. Being a small independent record label, Laurie's chart successes usually occurred one at a time and, for the most part, with <b>one-off</b> <b>hits,</b> {{as was the case with}} the Mystics, the Jarmels, the Chiffons, and the Royal Guardsmen. In 1966, Laurie released a psychedelic single, [...] "Charity" [...] by the Gray Things, which appears on multiple compilation albums, including Mindrocker, a 13 CD anthology of US 60's psychedelic recordings released in Germany in 1982. [...] "Charity" [...] was issued in limited quantities but it remains popular today via multiple [...] "You Tube" [...] posts.|$|R
5000|$|The suburb {{achieved}} a mild degree of worldwide fame with the <b>one-off</b> <b>hit</b> single How Bizarre, by hip-hop artists OMC. [...] "OMC" [...] stands for [...] "Otara Millionaires' Club" [...] - a tongue-in-cheek {{reference to the}} low socio-economic status {{of much of the}} suburb, Ōtara being one of the poorest parts of the Auckland region - Ōtara North being Auckland Region's suburb with the second lowest median income, at NZ$25,900 after Great Barrier Island at NZ$25,100, and compared to an average of NZ$37,300 and the highest value of NZ$60,000.|$|E
5000|$|In January 2007, BioWare staff {{announced}} {{there were}} no plans to develop Jade Empire 2. However, BioWare co-founders Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk stated in September 2011: [...] "It's an IP, it's a setting that we were really passionate about, and we still are. Both Greg and I were big believers in the IP... We're just looking for {{the right way to}} deploy it." [...] In 2009, GamesRadar included Jade Empire among the games [...] "with untapped franchise potential", commenting: [...] "The original game had all the trappings of franchise material with engrossing characters, magnificent settings, and a unique take on martial arts-fueled RPG combat. But until hard evidence of a sequel's existence materializes, we’ll continue yearning for BioWare's <b>one-off</b> <b>hit</b> to attain franchise status." ...|$|E
50|$|It is speculated, {{but never}} confirmed, that the managements of TVB drafted its top {{actors and actresses}} to perform in the series, and rushed the {{production}} into broadcast as a weapon against the resurgent ATV. Supporters of this theory point to the splitting of the series into two parts, with a gap in between the broadcast to allow for production time. Opponents of the speculation assert that ATV only had a <b>one-off</b> <b>hit</b> with My Fair Princess, {{and there were no}} other series afterward that could have retained the audience that eventually returned to TVB. The opponents also allude to the fact that even during the lowest point of the entire crisis, TVB still retained a competitive edge in ratings, and {{would have been able to}} defeat ATV right after My Fair Princess concluded. However, this still does not provide an explanation to the gap between two series.|$|E
2500|$|After {{having a}} <b>one-off</b> {{international}} <b>hit</b> with her song [...] "Just One Look" [...] in 1963, Doris Troy increasingly looked to Britain for continued {{success as a}} solo artist. Her brand of soul music was revered there throughout the 1960s and had produced hits for bands such as the Hollies and the Small Faces. Troy settled in London in 1969 and became a sought-after vocal arranger, most notably contributing the gospel-inflected chorus to the Rolling Stones' song [...] "You Can't Always Get What You Want". In the early summer of 1969, {{at the invitation of}} singer Madeline Bell, Troy attended the overdub sessions for Billy Preston's first album on Apple Records, That's the Way God Planned It. On meeting Preston's producer, George Harrison, Troy was surprised to learn that he was a fan of her work, and following the sessions, Harrison offered her a recording contract with Apple.|$|R
