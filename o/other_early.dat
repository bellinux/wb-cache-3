Most scholars hold that these and <b>other</b> <b>early</b> accounts ultimately derive from Eusebius of Caesarea's Historia Ecclesiastica (Ecclesiastical History).|$|E

The opening night was delayed until the abolition of theatre censorship in England under the Theatres Act 1968 so that the show could include nudity and profanity. As with <b>other</b> <b>early</b> productions, the London show added a sprinkling of local allusions and other minor departures from the Broadway version.|$|E

5|$|In 893 Asser wrote a {{biography}} of Alfred, called the Life of King Alfred. The manuscript survived to modern times in only one copy, {{which was part of}} the Cotton library. That copy was destroyed in a fire in 1731, but transcriptions that had been made earlier, together with material from Asser's work which was included by <b>other</b> <b>early</b> writers, have enabled the work to be reconstructed. The biography is the main source of information about Alfred's life and provides far more information about Alfred than is known about any <b>other</b> <b>early</b> English ruler. Asser assisted Alfred in his translation of Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care, and possibly with other works.|$|E
5|$|John Gould and <b>other</b> <b>early</b> writers {{referred}} to the species as the black-and-white fantail, although did note the current name. However, willie wagtail rapidly became widely accepted sometime after 1916. Wagtail is derived from its active behaviour, while the origins of willie are obscure. The name had been in use colloquially for the pied subspecies of the white wagtail (Motacilla alba) on the Isle of Man, and Northern Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Many {{teeth are}} widest at their midsections and narrow {{closer to the}} jaws, giving them the {{appearance}} of a teardrop. Teardrop-shaped teeth are unique to Dimetrodon and other closely related sphenacodontids, and help distinguish them from <b>other</b> <b>early</b> synapsids. As in many <b>other</b> <b>early</b> synapsids, the teeth of most Dimetrodon species are serrated at their edges. The serrations of Dimetrodon teeth were so fine that they resembled tiny cracks. The dinosaur Albertosaurus had similarly crack-like serrations, but, at the base of each serration was a round void, which would have functioned to distribute force over a larger surface area and prevent the stresses of feeding from causing the crack to spread through the tooth. Unlike Albertosaurus, Dimetrodon teeth lacked adaptations that would stop cracks from forming at their serrations. The teeth of D.teutonis lack serrations, but still have sharp edges.|$|E

5|$|Albert Brooks guest {{starred in}} the episode {{as the voice of}} Cowboy Bob. He was not sure if he wanted to be {{identified}} with a cartoon show or not at the time, like many of the <b>other</b> <b>early</b> guest stars on The Simpsons, and was therefore credited as A. Brooks in the ending credits. This episode was a satire of the Bigfoot specials that had aired on the Fox network at the time when this episode was written. A lot of resources were spent on the backgrounds in the episode, trying to make them look realistic with many observational details such as trees, rocks, fences and the way the cars were positioned. Burger King figurines were made out of the camping designs of the Simpsons family in this episode.|$|E
5|$|As the new-fangled Ford Model Ts and <b>other</b> <b>early</b> {{automobiles}} {{increasingly took}} to the roads in the 1920s, inland steamship lines in the U.S. initially resisted carrying automobiles on their boats.

The Depression and loss of business to improved highways took an increasing toll of many U.S. steamship lines in the 1930s, as historic companies such as the Fall River Line ceased operation in 1937, preceded by the Lake Champlain company, which was the oldest steamboat line in the U.S. at its demise in 1932.|$|E
