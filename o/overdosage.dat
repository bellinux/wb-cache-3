5|$|Metformin may be {{quantified}} in blood, plasma, or serum to monitor therapy, confirm {{a diagnosis of}} poisoning, or assist in a forensic death investigation. Blood or plasma metformin concentrations are usually {{in a range of}} 1–4mg/l in persons receiving therapeutic doses, 40–120mg/l in victims of acute <b>overdosage,</b> and 80–200mg/l in fatalities. Chromatographic techniques are commonly employed.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam may be {{quantified}} in blood or plasma to confirm {{a diagnosis of}} poisoning in hospitalized patients, provide evidence in an impaired driving arrest, or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma alprazolam concentrations are usually {{in a range of}} 10–100 μg/L in persons receiving the drug therapeutically, 100–300 μg/L in those arrested for impaired driving, and 300–2000 μg/L in victims of acute <b>overdosage.</b> Most commercial immunoassays for the benzodiazepine class of drugs cross-react with alprazolam, but confirmation and quantitation is usually performed using chromatographic techniques.|$|E
5|$|Concentrations of {{midazolam}} or {{its major}} metabolite, 1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide, may {{be measured in}} plasma, serum, or whole blood to monitor for safety in those receiving the drug therapeutically, to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, or to assist in a forensic investigation of a case of fatal <b>overdosage.</b> Patients with renal dysfunction may exhibit prolongation of elimination half-life for both the parent drug and its active metabolite, with accumulation of these two substances in the bloodstream {{and the appearance of}} adverse depressant effects.|$|E
50|$|Benzydamine {{has been}} used recreationally. In <b>overdosages</b> it acts a deliriant and CNS stimulant. Such use, {{particularly}} among teenagers, {{has been reported in}} Poland, Brazil and Romania.|$|R
50|$|In humans, leucovorin rescue at <b>overdosages</b> {{lower than}} 10 mg {{aminopterin}} {{in an average}} 70 kg adult should comprise an initial leucovorin dose of at least 20 mg (10.0 mg/m2), given intravenously (preferably), or orally. Subsequent doses of 20 mg (which may be taken orally) should be given at 6 hour intervals until hematological abnormalities are improved.|$|R
40|$|Mice {{deficient}} in selenoprotein P exhibit a disturbed selenium distribution and reduced activities of other selenoenzymes and display defects in growth and motor co-ordination. We have normalized selenoenzyme activities and rescued the phenotype of mutant mice by supplementing their nursing mothers with sodium selenite. Our {{results indicate that}} selenium from inorganic sources can be transferred efficiently via mother's milk to the developing offspring {{in a form that}} is both highly bioavailable by target tissues and yet sufficiently safe to prevent <b>overdosages...</b>|$|R
5|$|Mephedrone may be quantitated in blood, plasma or urine by gas chromatography-mass {{spectrometry}} or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry {{to confirm}} {{a diagnosis of}} poisoning in hospitalised patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma mephedrone concentrations {{are expected to be}} in a range of 50–100 μg/l in persons using the drug recreationally, >100 μg/l in intoxicated patients and >500 μg/l in victims of acute <b>overdosage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol may be {{quantified}} in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or {{to aid in}} the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30mg/l, which equals 200 µmol/L. Levels of 30–300mg/L (200–2000 µmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50–400mg/L in persons dying due to acute <b>overdosage.</b> Automated colorimetric techniques, gas chromatography and liquid chromatography are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.|$|E
25|$|Meprobamate <b>overdosage</b> {{is still}} a {{continuing}} problem.|$|E
50|$|Henbane {{ingestion}} {{by humans}} is followed simultaneously by peripheral inhibition and central stimulation. Common effects of henbane ingestion include hallucinations, dilated pupils, restlessness, and flushed skin. Less common effects are tachycardia, convulsions, vomiting, hypertension, hyperpyrexia, and ataxia. Initial effects typically last {{for three to}} four hours, while aftereffects may last up to three days. The side effects of henbane ingestion are dryness in the mouth, confusion, locomotor and memory disturbances, and farsightedness. <b>Overdosages</b> result in delirium, coma, respiratory paralysis, and death. Low and average dosages have inebriating and aphrodisiac effects.|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} case of acute {{intoxication}} due to a massive overdose of isotretinoin. A 17 year-old male patient had ingested 16 capsules of isotretinoin(20 mg) with suicidal intentions. He presented with nausea, dizziness and myalgia on extremities. 2 hours after the attempt he was aplied to our clinics. We administered gastric lavage and active charcoal treatment before taking him to {{the intensive care unit}} for observation. 24 hours later, cutaneous xerosis and desquamation of the face especially the nasolabial region occurred; cutaneous xerosis resolved spontaneously. The side-effects were only mild exacerbations of some common isotretinoin side-effects. There was a low toxicity of isotretinoin overdose. To date few cases of isotretinoin <b>overdosages</b> have been reported. Being allert when using isotretinoin on a teenager may save life because this drug may exacerbate deppression as a side effect...|$|R
40|$|Biologics {{are highly}} {{specific}} and exhibit few problems {{in regard to}} <b>overdosages.</b> In clinical practice, induction schemes with an initial loading dose and a subsequent lower maintenance dose have been established and are of higher efficacy for psoriasis than starting directly with the maintenance dose. As obese patients sometimes respond less well to standard dosages, increases of the maintenance dose, but not the loading doses, have been tried with variable success. In our study, we increased the loading (160 mg instead of 80 mg) but not the maintenance dose of adalimumab in an obese patient with severe psoriasis resistant to previous biologics and methotrexate. Within 12 weeks, both PASI (11 to 1. 6) and DLQI (22 / 30 to 5 / 30) decreased. This strategy might be an effective and less costly alternative to doubling the maintenance doses, and could be further evaluated for psoriasis patients refractory to previous treatments...|$|R
25|$|Fluoxetine and norfluoxetine may be quantitated in blood, plasma or serum {{to monitor}} therapy, confirm a {{diagnosis}} of poisoning in hospitalized patients or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma fluoxetine concentrations are usually {{in a range of}} 50–500μg/L in persons taking the drug for its antidepressant effects, 900–3000 μg/L in survivors of acute <b>overdosage</b> and 1000–7000μg/L in victims of fatal <b>overdosage.</b> Norfluoxetine concentrations are approximately equal to those of the parent drug during chronic therapy, but may be substantially less following acute <b>overdosage,</b> since it requires at least 1–2 weeks for the metabolite to achieve equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{specific}} antidote for trazodone. Management of <b>overdosage</b> should, therefore, be symptomatic and supportive. Any person {{suspected of having}} taken an <b>overdosage</b> should be evaluated at a hospital as soon as possible. Activated charcoal, and forced diuresis {{may be useful in}} facilitating elimination of the drug, gastric lavage has been shown to not be useful unless done during the first hour after intake.|$|E
25|$|In {{the event}} of an acute <b>overdosage,</b> {{authorities}} recommend unspecific standard procedures such as emptying the stomach, observing the patient and maintaining appropriate hydration. Levofloxacin is not efficiently removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.|$|E
40|$|The morphology, both {{normal and}} pathological, of the kidney {{has been widely}} investigated. Pathologists, biochemists, physiologists, pharmacologists, and more recently, endocrinologists have all contributed much {{valuable}} information {{which has led to}} a better understanding of the structure as well as of the function of this vital organ. Many techniques and experimental approaches have been employed, and a wealth of data has been accumulated. Among these techniques may be found those of the nutritionist. Effects of both <b>overdosages</b> and deficiencies of numerous elements and compounds have been investigated. Unfortunately, this work has been done by so many different investigators under various conditions and for a variety of reasons, that it has proven difficult to collect and to correlate all this huge volume of experimental data concerning the effect of diet on the kidney. It is the aim of this thesis to provide a critical review of the effects of dietary constituents upon renal size and structure. Many of the experimental results obtained to-date (1945) will be enumerated, correlated and commented upon. In order first to present as clear a picture as possible of what we know to-day about this subject and second, to act as a guide for further reading and experimental investigation in this field.

40|$|A simple, rapid, {{and precise}} gas chromatographic method for determina-tion of serum {{diazepam}} concentrations is described. Two milliliters of serum is extracted with chloroform, and the extract is concentrated and injected into a gas chromatograph. Of the many drugs and serum samples tested, none {{interferes with the}} determination of diazepam. D IAZEPAM (VALIUM, ROCHE), a benzodiazepine derivative, is widely used as a psychothera-peutic drug. A rapid, precise, and sensitive method for determining serum Valium levels is needed to detect <b>overdosages</b> in individuals, {{as well as to}} determine whether psychiatric patients have ex-ceeded prescribed therapeutic dosages. DeSilva et al. (1) described a uv-spectrophoto-metric method for Valium, but the method is very time consuming, requiring three extractions and four washing steps. A gas-liquid chromatographic method for Val-ium was described by DeSilva et al. () which re-quires eight extractions in addition to sample concentration and conversion of Valium to a benzo-phenone derivative. We describe here a simple, rapid, precise, and sensitive gas chromatographic method for deter-mining serum Valium concentrations. The pro-cedure takes less than 1 h to complete and involves a single chloroform extraction of 2 ml of serum, concentration of the extract, and gas chromatog-raphic analysis. Valium appears as a well-defined peak with a retention time of about 9. 6 mm. No interferences with the estimation of Valium by this method have been found...|$|R
40|$|Irradiation {{of moving}} targets using a scanned ion beam can cause {{clinically}} intolerable under- and <b>overdosages</b> within the target volume {{due to the}} interplay effect. Several motion mitigation techniques such as gating, beam tracking and rescanning are currently investigated to overcome this restriction. To enable detailed experimental studies of potential mitigation techniques a complex thorax phantom was developed. The phantom consists of an artificial thorax with ribs to introduce density changes. The contraction of the thorax can be controlled by a stepping motor. A robotic driven detector head positioned inside the thorax mimics e. g. a lung tumour. The detector head comprises 20 ionization chambers and 5 radiographic films for target dose measurements. The phantom's breathing {{as well as the}} 6 D tumour motion (3 D translation, 3 D rotation) can be programmed independently and adjusted online. This flexibility allows studying the dosimetric effects of correlation mismatches between internal and external motions, irregular breathing, or baseline drifts to name a few. Commercial motion detection systems, e. g. VisionRT or Anzai belt, can be mounted as they would be mounted in a patient case. They are used to control the 4 D treatment delivery and to generate data for 4 D dose calculation. To evaluate the phantom's properties, measurements addressing reproducibility, stability, temporal behaviour and performance of dedicated breathing manoeuvres were performed. In addition, initial dosimetric tests for treatment with a scanned carbon beam are reported...|$|R
25|$|<b>Overdosage</b> {{may result}} in vomiting, sedation, {{disturbances}} in heart rhythm, dizziness, sweating, nausea, tremor, and rarely amnesia, confusion, coma, or convulsions. Overdose deaths have occurred, sometimes involving other drugs, but also with citalopram as the sole agent. Citalopram and N-desmethylcitalopram may be quantified in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma citalopram concentrations are usually {{in a range of}} 50-400 μg/l in persons receiving the drug therapeutically, 1000-3000 μg/l in patients who survive acute <b>overdosage</b> and 3–30mg/l in those who do not survive. It is the most dangerous of SSRIs in overdose.|$|E
25|$|Atomoxetine may be quantitated in plasma, serum or {{whole blood}} {{in order to}} {{distinguish}} extensive versus poor metabolizers in those receiving the drug therapeutically, to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims or {{to assist in the}} forensic investigation in a case of fatal <b>overdosage.</b>|$|E
25|$|Currently in the United States, {{nitric oxide}} is a gas {{available}} in concentrations of only 100 ppm and 800 ppm. <b>Overdosage</b> with inhaled nitric oxide {{will be seen}} by elevations in methemoglobin and pulmonary toxicities associated with inspired ·NO. Elevated NO may cause acute lung injury.|$|E
25|$|The {{concentration}} of methylphenidate or ritalinic acid, its major metabolite, may be quantified in plasma, serum or whole blood {{in order to}} monitor compliance in those receiving the drug therapeutically, to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims or {{to assist in the}} forensic investigation in a case of fatal <b>overdosage.</b>|$|E
25|$|Several {{renal failure}} {{patients}} developed myoclonus while receiving pregabalin, apparently {{as a result}} of gradual accumulation of the drug. Acute <b>overdosage</b> may be manifested by somnolence, tachycardia and hypertonicity. Plasma, serum or blood concentrations of pregabalin may be measured to monitor therapy or to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients.|$|E
25|$|Acute <b>overdosage</b> {{is often}} {{manifested}} by emesis, lethargy, ataxia, tachycardia and seizures. Plasma, serum or blood concentrations of sertraline and norsertraline, its major active metabolite, may be measured to confirm {{a diagnosis of}} poisoning in hospitalized patients or {{to aid in the}} medicolegal investigation of fatalities. As with most other SSRIs its toxicity in overdose is considered relatively low.|$|E
25|$|Insecticides* used in {{dogs for}} fleas and ticks {{commonly}} contain either organophosphates or carbamates. {{they can be}} absorbed through the skin, conjunctiva, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs. Organophosphates inhibit acetylcholinesterase irreversibly and carbamates inhibit cholinesterase reversibly. Toxicity occurs through <b>overdosage</b> with an appropriate product or use of an agricultural product. Signs for both include hypersalivation, vomiting, lethargy, tremors, difficulty walking, weakness, and death.|$|E
25|$|Caffeine can be {{quantified}} in blood, plasma, or serum to monitor therapy in neonates, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or facilitate a medicolegal death investigation. Plasma caffeine levels are usually {{in the range of}} 2–10mg/L in coffee drinkers, 12–36mg/L in neonates receiving treatment for apnea, and 40–400mg/L in victims of acute <b>overdosage.</b> Urinary caffeine concentration is frequently measured in competitive sports programs, for which a level in excess of 15mg/L is usually considered to represent abuse.|$|E
25|$|Fentanyl may be {{measured}} in blood or urine to monitor for abuse, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Commercially-available immunoassays are often used as initial screening tests, but chromatographic techniques are generally used for confirmation and quantitation. Blood or plasma fentanyl concentrations {{are expected to be}} in a range of 0.3–3.0 μg/l in persons using the drug therapeutically, 1–10 μg/l in intoxicated patients and 3-300 μg/l in victims of acute <b>overdosage.</b>|$|E
25|$|Clonazepam and 7-aminoclonazepam may be {{quantified}} in plasma, serum or whole blood {{in order to}} monitor compliance in those receiving the drug therapeutically. Results from such tests {{can be used to}} confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal <b>overdosage.</b> Both the parent drug and 7-aminoclonazepam are unstable in biofluids, and therefore specimens should be preserved with sodium fluoride, stored at the lowest possible temperature and analyzed quickly to minimize losses.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} persons have {{developed}} toxicity due to acute <b>overdosage</b> with nifedipine, either accidentally or intentionally, and via either oral or parenteral administration. The adverse effects include lethargy, bradycardia, marked hypotension and loss of consciousness. The drug may be quantitated in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Analytical methods usually involve gas or liquid chromatography and specimen concentrations are usually in the 100-1000 μg/L range.|$|E
25|$|Mercury may be {{measured}} in blood or urine to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized people or {{to assist in the}} forensic investigation in a case of fatal <b>overdosage.</b> Some analytical techniques are capable of distinguishing organic from inorganic forms of the metal. The concentrations in both fluids tend to reach high levels early after exposure to inorganic forms, while lower but very persistent levels are observed following exposure to elemental or organic mercury. Chelation therapy can cause a transient elevation of urine mercury levels.|$|E
25|$|Pseudoephedrine may be quantitated in blood, plasma or urine {{to monitor}} any {{possible}} performance-enhancing use by athletes, confirm {{a diagnosis of}} poisoning or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Many commercial immunoassay screening tests directed at the amphetamines cross-react appreciably with pseudoephedrine, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish pseudoephedrine from other phenethylamine derivatives. Blood or plasma pseudoephedrine concentrations are typically in the 50–300µg/l range in persons taking the drug therapeutically, 500–3000µg/l in abusers or poisoned patients and 10–70mg/l in cases of acute fatal <b>overdosage.</b>|$|E
25|$|GHB may be quantitated {{in blood}} or plasma to confirm a {{diagnosis}} of poisoning in hospitalized patients, provide evidence in an impaired driving arrest or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma GHB concentrations are usually {{in a range of}} 50–250mg/L in persons receiving the drug therapeutically (during general anesthesia), 30–100mg/L in those arrested for impaired driving, 50–500mg/L in acutely intoxicated patients and 100–1000mg/L in victims of fatal <b>overdosage.</b> Urine is often the preferred specimen for routine drug abuse monitoring purposes. Both γ-butyrolactone (GBL) and 1,4-butanediol are converted to GHB in the body.|$|E
25|$|Catecholamine receptors {{persisted in}} this {{wavering}} state {{for more than}} forty years. Additional blocking agents were found such as tolazoline in Switzerland and phenoxybenzamine in the United States, but like the ergot alkaloids they blocked only the smooth muscle excitatory receptors. Additional agonists also were synthesized. Outstanding among them became isoprenaline, N-isopropyl-noradrenaline, of Boehringer Ingelheim, studied pharmacologically along with adrenaline and other N-substituted noradrenaline derivatives by Richard Rössler (1897–1945) and Heribert Konzett (1912–2004) in Vienna. The Viennese pharmacologists used their own Konzett-Rössler test to examine bronchodilation. Intravenous injection of pilocarpine to induce bronchospasm was followed by intravenous injection of the agonists. “Arrangement of all amines according to their bronchodilator effect yields a series from the most potent, isopropyl-adrenaline, via the approximately equipotent bodies adrenaline, propyl-adrenaline and butyl-adrenaline, to the weakly active isobutyl-adrenaline.” Isoprenaline also exerted marked positive chronotropic and inotropic effects. Boehringer introduced it for use in asthma in 1940. After the war it became available to Germany’s former enemies {{and over the years}} was traded under about 50 names. In addition to this therapeutic success {{it was one of the}} agonists with which Raymond P. Ahlquist solved the ″myoneural junction″ riddle. “By virtue of this property the reputation of the substance spread all over the world and it became a tool for many investigations on different aspects of pharmacology and therapeutics.” The story had a dark side: <b>overdosage</b> caused numerous deaths due to cardiac side effects, an estaimated three thousands in the United Kingdom alone.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Overdosage</b> of {{temazepam}} {{results in}} increasing CNS effects, including: ...|$|E
2500|$|Bromazepam is {{commonly}} involved in drug overdoses. [...] A severe bromazepam benzodiazepine overdose {{may result in}} an alpha pattern coma type. The toxicity of bromazepam in <b>overdosage</b> increases when combined with other CNS depressant drugs such as alcohol or sedative hypnotic drugs. Bromazepam {{is the most common}} benzodiazepine involved in intentional overdoses in France. Bromazepam has also been responsible for accidental poisonings in companion animals. A review of benzodiazepine poisonings in cats and dogs from 1991-1994 found bromazepam to be responsible for significantly more poisonings than any other benzodiazepine.|$|E
2500|$|Central {{nervous system}} {{problems}} such as hallucinations or confusion have been observed in rare cases, attributed mostly to <b>overdosage.</b> [...] Such properties {{have been attributed to}} hydroxyzine in several cases, particularly in patients treated for neuropsychological disorders, as well as in cases where overdoses have been observed. While there are reports of the [...] "hallucinogenic" [...] or [...] "hypnotic" [...] properties of hydroxyzine, several clinical data trials have not reported such side effects from the sole consumption of hydroxyzine, but rather, have described its overall calming effect described through the stimulation of areas within the formatio reticularis. The hallucinogenic or hypnotic properties have been described as being an additional effect from overall central nervous system suppression by other CNS agents, such as lithium or ethanol.|$|E
