40|$|Introduction:Given {{one third}} of the human {{population}} have been infected with tuberculosis, it is important to delineate the relationship between tuberculosis and <b>lung</b> <b>cancer.</b> This study explored whether contracting pulmonary tuberculosis is associated with an increased risk <b>of</b> developing <b>lung</b> <b>cancers.</b> Methods:In a cohort of 716, 872 insured subjects, free from cancers, aged 20 years and older, 4480 patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis were identified from the universal insurance claims in 1998 – 2000 and tracked until 2007 with the remaining insured without tuberculosis. We compared the incidence <b>of</b> <b>lung</b> <b>cancers</b> between the two cohorts and measured the associated hazard <b>of</b> developing <b>lung</b> <b>cancer.</b> Results:The incidence <b>of</b> <b>lung</b> <b>cancers</b> was approximately 11 -fold higher in the cohort of patients with tuberculosis than nontuberculosis subjects (26. 3 versus 2. 41 per 10, 000 person-years). Cox proportional hazard regression analysis showed a hazard ratio of 4. 37 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 3. 56 – 5. 36) for the tuberculosis cohort after adjustment for the sociodemographic variables or 3. 32 (95 % CI: 2. 70 – 4. 09) after further adjustment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), smoking-related <b>cancers</b> (other than <b>lung</b> <b>cancer),</b> etc. The hazard ratio increased to 6. 22 (95 % CI: 4. 87 – 7. 94) with the combined effect with COPD or to 15. 5 (95 % CI: 2. 17 – 110) with the combined effect with other smoking-related cancers. Conclusions:This study provides a compelling evidence <b>of</b> increased <b>lung</b> <b>cancer</b> risk among individuals with tuberculosis. The risk may increase further with coexisting COPD or other smoking-related cancers...|$|R
