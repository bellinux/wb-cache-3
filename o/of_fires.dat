5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, opium dens {{used to be}} common in the Sungei Road area. The drugs were popular with workers looking for a cheap way to ease the {{hardship}} of the day's toil. The opium addicts were mainly poor, elderly people from working-class groups. In early 1991, a spate <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> destroyed more than 20 shophouses along Sungei Road. Most of the century-old shophouses, crumbling with age, had become potential fire hazards for its residents. The first fire incident left two people injured and 61 homeless. As a result, many of its buildings were torn down for safety reason and its inhabitants relocated in later years.|$|E

5|$|On 20 September, the 17th and 122nd French Colonial Divisions {{along with}} the 1st Serbian Army crossed river Crna. News of a {{breakthrough}} at Dobro Pole prompted the defenders of Doiran to abandon their positions and rush {{to the defense of}} their homeland, in order to prevent a future occupation by the Entente. On 21 September, the Allies became aware of the Bulgarian withdrawal after observing a series <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> and munition dump explosions on the Bulgarian positions, a pursuit by the British XII Corps was launched immediately. The Serbian advanced guard approached Krivolak, thus creating a wedge between the 1st Bulgarian and 11th German Armies in an effort to force the latter to retire towards Albania. The 2nd Bulgarian Army headed towards the Kosturino Pass avoiding direct engagement with the Allies.|$|E
5|$|One {{large group}} <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> {{was known as}} the Snake River Complex. These fires were in the {{southern}} section of the park, in the headwaters region of the Yellowstone and Snake Rivers. The largest fire in the group was the Shoshone fire which was started by lightning on June 23. The prescribed natural burn policy was still in effect, and at first no efforts were made to suppress this fire. It smoldered with little movement for several weeks, then rapidly started expanding towards the northeast on July 20.|$|E
5|$|The Kaiserliche Marine {{considered}} {{sending the}} two ships to attack convoys in the Atlantic Ocean, but the difficulties associated with refueling at sea convinced the Germans {{to abandon the}} plan.

On 21 June 1919, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, ordered the scuttling of the fleet. She was salvaged in 1929 by teams working for Ernest Cox, though they had to contend with large quantities of oil and the risks <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> and explosions. Having been brought back to the surface after a decade underwater, she was then scrapped.|$|E

5|$|The Reformation brought Roskilde's {{development}} {{to an abrupt}} stop. While the cathedral continued to be the preferred location for the entombment of the Danish monarchs, {{most of the other}} religious institutions disappeared. For the next three centuries, the city suffered a series of disasters including the effects of the Dano-Swedish War which terminated with the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658, the plague in 1710 and 1711, and a series <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> in 1730. Conditions improved in 1835 when the city became the Assembly of the Estates of the Realm (Rådgivende Stænderforsamling) and in 1847 with the railway connecting Copenhagen and Roskilde.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} usually found in dry sclerophyll forest on sandstone-based nutrient-deficient soil. It has adapted to a fire-prone environment; plants lost in bushfires can {{regenerate}} through a ground-stored seed bank. Seedlings mostly germinate {{within two years}} <b>of</b> <b>fires.</b> Several species of native bee of the genus Leioproctus pollinate the flowers. Swamp wallabies are a main consumer of its fruit, and the seeds are spread in wallaby faeces. Its lifespan ranges from 25 to 60 years, though difficulties in propagation have seen low cultivation rates.|$|E
5|$|About thirty-five {{natural forest}} fires are ignited {{each year by}} lightning, while another six to ten are started by people— in most cases by accident. Yellowstone National Park has three fire lookout towers, each staffed by trained fire fighters. The easiest one to reach is atop Mount Washburn, which has interpretive {{exhibits}} and an observation deck open to the public. The park also monitors fire from the air and relies on visitor reports of smoke and/or flames. Fire towers are staffed almost continuously from late June to mid-September— the primary fire season. Fires burn with the greatest intensity {{in the late afternoon}} and evening. Few fires burn more than , and the vast majority <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> reach only a little over an acre (0.5ha) before they burn themselves out. Fire management focuses on monitoring dead and down wood quantities, soil and tree moisture, and the weather, to determine those areas most vulnerable to fire should one ignite. Current policy is to suppress all human caused fires and to evaluate natural fires, examining the benefit or detriment they may pose on the ecosystem. If a fire is considered to be an immediate threat to people and structures, or will burn out of control, then fire suppression is performed.|$|E

40|$|Youth misuse <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> is a {{substantive}} community concern. Despite evidence which indicates youths {{account for a}} significant proportion of all deliberately lit fires within Australia, an absence of up-to-date, contextually specific research means the exact scope and magnitude of youth misuse <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> within Australia remains unknown. Despite research suggesting com- monalities exist between youth misuse <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> and juvenile offending more broadly, misuse <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> is rarely explained using criminological theory. In light of this gap, a descriptive analysis of youth misuse <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> within New South Wales was performed. Routine Activity Theory and Crime Pattern Theory were tested to explain differences in misuse <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> across age groups. Results suggest these environmental theories offer useful frameworks for explaining youth misuse <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> in New South Wales.

5|$|Boise National Forest's 2010 forest plan {{recognizes that}} fire and other {{disturbances}} play {{important roles in}} maintaining the character and function of ecosystems. However, previous management strategies (as recently as the 1990 forest plan) treated fire as an undesirable process, and the Organic Act of 1897 explicitly stated that forests were {{to be protected from}} destruction by fire. In historic conditions fires naturally occurred on the landscape; the suppression <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> allowed dead trees to accumulate in excess of historic levels and land cover types to change, such as a shift to higher shrub and tree densities. An estimated 14 percent of the land in Boise National Forest has been affected by fires since the early 1990s, and about 10 percent of the land capable of timber production was burned so severely that land cover shifted from forest to grass and shrubland (as of 2010).|$|E
5|$|Large and {{dangerous}} fires sometimes resulted. On 4 May 1897, {{one of the}} first major fires involving nitrate film began when a Lumière projector caught fire at the Bazar de la Charité in Paris; the resulting blaze caused 180 deaths. In the United States, a series <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> occurred at industry facilities. The Lubin Manufacturing Company's vault in Philadelphia exploded on 13 June 1914, followed on 9 December by a fire that destroyed Thomas Edison's laboratory complex in West Orange, New Jersey. The New York studio of the Famous Players Film Company burned in September 1915; in July 1920, the shipping facility of its corporate successor, Famous Players-Lasky, was destroyed by a fire in Kansas City, Missouri, despite construction intended to minimize that risk. The United Film Ad Service vault, also in Kansas City, burned on 4 August 1928, and a fire was reported at Pathé Exchange nine days later. In October 1929, the Consolidated Film Industries facility was badly damaged by a nitrate fire. Spontaneous combustion was not proven to have occurred in any of these fires; {{it is possible that the}} potential of nitrate film to self-ignite was not even recognized before 1933.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{ambulances}} {{are typically}} powered by internal combustion engines, {{which can be}} powered by any conventional fuel, including diesel, gasoline or liquefied petroleum gas, depending on the preference of the operator {{and the availability of}} different options. Colder regions often use gasoline-powered engines, as diesels can be difficult to start when they are cold. Warmer regions may favor diesel engines, as they are thought to be more efficient and more durable. Diesel power is sometimes chosen due to safety concerns, after a series <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> involving gasoline-powered ambulances during the 1980s. These fires were ultimately attributed in part to gasoline's higher volatility in comparison to diesel fuel. The type of engine may be determined by the manufacturer: in the past two decades, Ford would only sell vehicles for ambulance conversion if they are diesel-powered. Beginning in 2010, Ford will sell its ambulance chassis with a gasoline engine in order to meet emissions requirements.|$|E
50|$|The field <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> <b>of</b> {{a weapon}} (or group of weapons) {{is the area}} around it that can easily and {{effectively}} be reached by gunfire.

40|$|The effect <b>of</b> {{different}} <b>fire</b> severity on {{the changes}} of the soil organic matter (SOM) and soil structure was evaluated. Soil samples were collected (May 2010) in the locality of Nitra-Dražovce (Slovakia) from the following plots: 1) control (unburned place), 2) low severity <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> and 3) higher severity <b>of</b> <b>fire.</b> The {{results showed that the}} content of water-stable microaggregates (WSAmi) increased by 20 % in the area with a low severity <b>of</b> <b>fire,</b> but on the other hand, it decreased by 42 % in the area with the higher severity <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> in comparison to control. The higher severity <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> resulted in a decrease of smaller size fractions of water-stable macroaggregates (WSAma) (0. 5 − 0. 25) and a low severity <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> resulted in the decrease of WSAma 2 − 0. 5 mm. On the other hand, the content of WSAma in the size fraction > 5 mm was higher by 54 % and by 32 % in the lower and higher severity <b>of</b> <b>fire,</b> respectively, than in unburned soil. The higher severity <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> had a more positive effect on increases of the structure coefficient and coefficient of aggregate stability, {{as well as on the}} decrease of the vulnerability coefficient compared to the low severity <b>of</b> <b>fire.</b> After burning, the contents of soil organic carbon (Corg) and labile carbon were significantly increased by the severity <b>of</b> <b>fire.</b> However, the low severity <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> affected more markedly the increase of hot water-soluble and cold water-soluble carbon than the higher severity <b>of</b> <b>fire.</b> After burning and due to the severity <b>of</b> <b>fire,</b> both the carbon of humic and carbon of fulvic acids ratios and SOM stability increased. The parameters of SOM due to fire significantly increased also in WSA with the least changes in WSAmi. The results showed that a low severity <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> increased Corg mainly in WSAma > 2 mm and WSAmi, whereas high severity fire increased Corg content in the smaller fraction of WSAma...|$|R

5|$|The Spirit of Fire {{releases}} the new Halo, but faces immediate resistance upon {{it from the}} Banished. Back on the Ark, Alice-130 and Douglas-042 destroy enemy barricades and prevent reinforcements, including Atriox, from reaching the Halo; they then use the portal network to reach the Halo themselves. There, Professor Anders is escorted to the ring’s control room, where the firing system of the structure is deactivated and a signal beacon is set. Meanwhile, the Spirit <b>of</b> <b>Fires</b> forces are locked in a struggle with {{the remnants of the}} Banished. Anders finds the gravity controls for the Halo and uses them to raise the land that the remaining Banished are standing on into space where it disintegrates. The ground forces return to the Spirit of Fire, but Anders and the Halo enter slipspace as they cannot halt the jump's countdown. Before the Halo jumps, Anders promises to get help from the UNSC as soon as possible. On the Ark, Atriox and a legion of Banished still live, preparing for the next fight against the UNSC. Meanwhile, the Halo carrying Anders drops out of slipspace prematurely, only to encounter a Foreunner construct known as a Guardian.|$|E
5|$|The Spirit <b>of</b> <b>Fires</b> crew awakens from cryosleep at the Ark and {{receives}} a UNSC {{signal from the}} surface of the installation. Spartan Red Team is deployed to investigate the signal.

Back on the Spirit of Fire, Isabel reveals to Captain Cutter how Atriox and the Banished invaded the Ark, which leads Cutter to declare war on the Banished. A strike team manages to set up a forward base and defeat Decimus, who is salvaging the Ark’s resources. Decimus escapes and orders a bombardment upon his own base. Upon investigating the wreckage, Isabel discovers information about the Cartographer, a map of key systems and weapons upon the Ark.
