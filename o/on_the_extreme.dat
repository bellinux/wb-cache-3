In the other direction, trains from Moorgate came off the Widened Lines via the Hotel Curve, to platform 16 (latterly renumbered 14) which rose to the main line level. Services to and from Moorgate were diverted via the Northern City Line from November 1976. The station remained in occasional use until it was completely closed on 5 March 1977.|$|E

5|$|After the 96th Infantry Division secured Conical Hill, the 7th Infantry Division {{returned}} to the line. It pushed into positions on the southern Ozato Mura hills, where Japanese resistance was heaviest. It was placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>extreme</b> left flank of the Tenth Army, taking the Ghinen peninsula, Sashiki, and Hanagusuku, fending off a series of Japanese counterattacks. Despite heavy Japanese resistance and prolonged bad weather, the division continued its advance until 21 June 1945, when the battle ended, having seen 82 days of combat. The island and surrendering troops were secured by the next day. During the Battle of Okinawa, the soldiers of the 7th Infantry Division killed between 25,000 and 28,000 Japanese soldiers and took 4,584 prisoners. Balanced against this, the 7th Division suffered 2,340 killed and 6,872 wounded {{for a total of}} 9,212 battle casualties during 208 days of combat. The division was slated to participate in Operation Downfall as a part of XXIV Corps under the First United States Army, but these plans were scrapped after the Japanese surrendered following the use of nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|Alexios {{deployed}} his smaller army {{in waiting}} near Bryennios's camp, and divided {{it in two}} commands. The left, which confronted Bryennios's strongest division, was commanded by himself and contained the Frankish knights {{to the right and}} the Immortals to the Franks' left. The right command was under Constantine Katakalon, and comprised the Chomatenoi and the Turks. The latter, according to the Alexiad, were given the role of flank guard (plagiophylakes) and tasked with observing and countering the Pechenegs. Conversely, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>extreme</b> left Alexios formed his own flanking detachment (apparently drawn from among the Immortals), concealed from enemy view inside a hollow. Given his inferiority, Alexios was forced to remain on the defensive. His only chance at success was that his out-flankers, concealed by the broken terrain, would surprise and create enough confusion among Bryennios's men for him and his strong left wing to break through their lines.|$|E

Ten minutes after the Indonesians were first seen, Private Sneddon, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>extreme</b> left, engaged a group of six Indonesians with a long burst of machine-gun fire, killing two instantly and a third as he ran towards him. Haines subsequently killed a fourth, while a fifth Indonesian continued past him, followed by five others, who then engaged the Australians. The Indonesian patrol continued to advance, taking them towards {{the rear of the}} Australian positions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to provide a perspective <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> of sea-level variability and predictability for the U.

Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Generalized <b>Extreme</b> Value (GEV) model, the L-moments method has been used to estimate the model parameters. The bootstrap method has been used to define the exceedance probability level of upper and lower bounds of the return periods at the 90 % confidence interval. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> basis of these return calculations and expected extremes of high sea level, the seasonal maxima of sea level and the varying likelihood of extreme events have been estimated. For analyzing the predictability of <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> of sea-level, a canonical correlation analysis (CCA) statistical model has been developed.

Each Ju 87 was loaded with 550-lb bombs under the main fuselage and four 11-lb bombs and two under each wing. The Bf 109s would not take off for some time. The long trip and low speed of the Ju 87s meant there was plenty of time to catch up without burning fuel keeping close contact with the Stukas.|$|E
5|$|By January 1917 the 3rd Division's {{artillery}} {{had been}} reorganised {{so that it}} consisted of two field artillery brigades, each of which consisted of three six-gun 18-pounder batteries and twelve 4.5inch howitzers. These brigades were the 7th (consisting of the 25th, 26th, 27th and 107th Batteries) and the 8th (29th, 30th, 31st and 108th Batteries). In April 1917 the division {{was moved to the}} Messines–Wytschaete Ridge section of the line in Belgium, taking up a position <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>extreme</b> right of II ANZAC Corps, with the New Zealand Division to its left. It was here, in early June 1917, that the division undertook its first major engagement of the war when it was committed to the fighting during the Battle of Messines. Monash tasked the 9th and 10th Brigades to provide the assault force for the 3rd Division's part of the operation, while the 11th Brigade was to act as the divisional reserve.|$|E
5|$|Julian's {{best hope}} for a quick victory lay in a cavalry breakthrough. Not only was the German cavalry {{probably}} smaller than his own, but its lack of armour made it vulnerable to his armoured regiments, especially the cataphracts. If they could rout the enemy horse, his squadrons could then wheel and attack the German lines in the flank or rear, and the battle would {{be as good as}} won. Julian's cavalry would thus aim to deliver a shock charge, careering forward in a wedge formation with the cataphracts forming the spearhead, the conventional armoured cavalry on either side and the light regiments <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>extreme</b> right, ready to block outflankers and to pursue fleeing enemy horse. The initial collision would shatter the enemy formation, and then the Germans could be overpowered in the ensuing melee. Failing a cavalry breakthrough, Julian would have to rely on a struggle of attrition on foot, in which superior Roman armour, training and formation discipline would almost inevitably prevail.|$|E

40|$|This study {{systematically}} compares different customer feedback metrics (CFMs) - namely customer satisfaction, the Net Promoter Score, and the Customer Effort Score - to {{test their}} ability to predict retention across {{a wide range of}} industries. We classify the CFMs according to a time focus (past, present, or future) and whether the full scale of the CFM is used or whether the focus is only <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> (e. g., top- 2 -box customer satisfaction). The data for this study represent customers of 93 firms across 18 industries. Multi-level probit regression models, which control for self-selection bias of respondents, investigate firm-, customer-, and industry-level effects simultaneously. Overall, we find that the top- 2 -box customer satisfaction performs best for predicting customer retention and that focusing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> is preferable to using the full scale. However the best CFM does differ depending <b>on</b> industry and <b>the</b> unit of analysis (i. e., comparing customers or firms with one another). Furthermore, combining CFMs, along with simultaneously investigating multiple dimensions of the customer relationship, improves predictions even further. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.
