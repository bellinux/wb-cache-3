5|$|In 1976, Canada {{hosted the}} first Canada Cup series. Perreault played with future Hockey Hall of Fame members such as Bobby Orr, Darryl Sittler, Bobby Hull, Guy Lafleur and Marcel Dionne. Perreault often played <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> with fellow Québécois Lafleur and Dionne. Canada won the series after beating Czechoslovakia in a best {{two out of}} three. He later played in the 1981 Canada Cup <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> with Wayne Gretzky and Lafleur. He was playing {{some of the best}} hockey of his career, leading all scorers with nine points in four games, when he was forced out of the tournament with a broken ankle. Canada lost the final to the USSR 81. Perreault was named to the All Tournament Team, despite playing in only four of Canada's seven games.|$|E

5|$|The Ottoman attackers dug {{themselves}} in <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> through Balin and Berkusie while the line {{taken up by}} the Australian Mounted Division began with the 3rd Light Horse Brigade facing east <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> running due north from about half way between Iraq el Menshiye and Summil. The line then turned westward so the 5th Mounted Brigade faced northwards in front of Summil with the 4th Light Horse Brigade to their left in front of Ipseir and connecting with the right of the infantry division; the 75th Division at Suafir esh Sharqiye. A critical situation created by the strong Ottoman attacking forces had been controlled by the coolness and steadiness of the troops, especially the machine-gun squadrons of the 5th Mounted and the 4th Light Horse Brigades. The Australian Mounted Division suffered about 50 casualties mainly from the 5th Mounted Brigade.|$|E

5|$|In {{high-speed}} territorial {{battles between}} male Australian emperors (Hemianax papuensis), the fighting dragonflies adjust their flight paths to appear stationary to their rivals, minimizing {{the chance of}} being detected as they approach. To achieve the effect, the attacking dragonfly flies towards his rival, choosing his path to remain <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> between the rival {{and the start of}} his attack path. The attacker thus looms larger as he closes on the rival, but does not otherwise appear to move. Researchers found that six of 15 encounters involved motion camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Lucic {{was chosen}} to his second YoungStars Game in January 2009. However, he did not compete for the sophomores in Montreal due to an {{undisclosed}} upper-body injury. Near {{the end of the}} season, on April 4, 2009, Lucic was awarded the Bruins' Eddie Shore Award for hustle and determination. He finished his second NHL season improving to 17 goals and 42 points in 72 games, while playing predominantly <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> with the Bruins' top centre, Marc Savard.|$|E
5|$|On 27 July 1999, a month {{following}} the draft, Henrik and Daniel signed three-year {{contracts with the}} Canucks. As the contract did not require them to begin playing in Vancouver immediately, they announced on 12 August they would return to Sweden to play one more season with Modo. During the 1999–2000 season, Henrik led Modo in scoring with 47points in 50games, two points ahead of Daniel. The two brothers played <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> with New York Islanders prospect Mattias Weinhandl.|$|E

5|$|The Parliamentary Army garrisoned {{the town}} upon the {{outbreak}} of the English Civil War in 1642 and established their headquarters there in June 1647 <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> from Staines to Watford, although the king passed through Uxbridge in April 1646, resting at the Red Lion public house for several hours. Charles I met with representatives of Parliament at the Crown Inn in Uxbridge in 1645, but negotiations for the end of hostilities were unsuccessful {{due in part to the}} king's stubborn attitude. The town had been chosen as it was located between the Royal headquarters at Oxford and the Parliamentary stronghold of London.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} waves, while {{directly}} {{powered by the}} wind, is distinct from a storm's wind-powered currents. Powerful wind whips up large, strong waves {{in the direction of}} its movement. Although these surface waves are responsible for very little water transport in open water, they may be responsible for significant transport near the shore. When waves are breaking <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> more or less parallel to the beach, they carry considerable water shoreward. As they break, the water particles moving toward the shore have considerable momentum and may run up a sloping beach to an elevation above the mean water line, which may exceed twice the wave height before breaking.|$|E

Näslund set a competition {{record for most}} goals scored {{in a single year}} with 13, while playing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> with Forsberg and Niklas Sundström. His 24points were second in the tournament behind Forsberg's 31. Although Sweden and Canada finished with identical records of six wins and one loss, Canada was awarded the gold medal by virtue of their 3–2 win against Sweden during round-robin play. Näslund was named along with Forsberg to the Tournament All-Star Team.|$|E

5|$|Todd Bertuzzi was {{the second}} member of the line to join the Canucks' franchise, when he was {{acquired}} by Vancouver via a trade during the 1997–98 season. The New York Islanders received former Canuck captain Trevor Linden in exchange for right winger Bertuzzi, defenceman Bryan McCabe and a third-round selection in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft (Jarkko Ruutu). Bertuzzi began the 1998–99 season playing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> with Mark Messier at centre and Alexander Mogilny on right wing. Bertuzzi played with the two until he suffered a fractured tibia, an injury that resulted in Naslund gaining increased ice time.|$|E

He was so surprised by the invite he initially thought one of his Calgary Flames teammates was playing a prank on him. He scored two goals in the gold medal game, a 5–2 victory over the United States, as Canada won its first Olympic gold medal in 50years. With this win, Iginla became the first black man to win a gold medal at the Winter Olympics. Iginla also represented Canada at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey as an alternate captain, playing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> with Joe Sakic and Mario Lemieux. Canada won the gold medal.|$|E
5|$|As NHL play resumed, Kariya {{made his}} debut against the Edmonton Oilers. He later scored his first career NHL goal on January 21, 1995, against Winnipeg Jets goaltender Tim Cheveldae. The goal {{came after a}} {{scramble}} around the crease knocked the puck loose {{in front of the}} net on a power play; Anaheim won the game 4–3. During his rookie season, he played <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> with Stéphan Lebeau and Shaun Van Allen. Early in the campaign, Kariya held the scoring lead amongst League rookies, but was later overtaken by Quebec Nordiques centre Peter Forsberg. Playing in 47 games, Kariya finished the season with a team-leading 18 goals and 39 points. As a team, however, the Mighty Ducks struggled in their second year since joining the NHL, finishing last in the Western Conference. Nominated for the Calder Memorial Trophy as the League's rookie of the year, Kariya lost the award to Forsberg. Despite being edged out, Kariya was named to the NHL All-Rookie Team. His play during his first NHL season earned him comparisons to Wayne Gretzky for his vision and Pavel Bure for his speed, while also earning accolades from Gretzky himself.|$|E

5|$|By day four, the battalions of the 1st Airlanding Brigade were {{dispersed}} {{over a wide}} area. While the Borders were to {{the west}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> from the River Rhine east of Heveadorp to the Heelsum road, the remaining KOSB companies lay to the north with {{the remnants of the}} Staffords forming part of Lonsdale Force in the east. Brigade headquarters was established on open ground at the centre of the divisional area. On day five (21 September), defence of the divisional area was divided between the two remaining brigade headquarters. The 1st Airlanding Brigade in the west now commanded the remaining three companies of Borders, the remnants of the KOSB, and what remained of the Royal Engineers, 21st Independent Company, Glider Pilots and Poles. Lonsdale Force Major Robert Henry Cain of the Staffords disabled a tank with a PIAT and then, although wounded by machine gun fire, positioned one of the division's artillery guns and destroyed it. This was the first of a number of actions by Major Cain which led to the award of a Victoria Cross. This second medal for the Staffords meant it became the only British battalion to receive two Victoria Crosses in one battle during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of Sasanian rule, a number of buffer states existed between the empires. These were absorbed by the central state over time, and by the 7th century the last buffer state, the Arab Lakhmids, was annexed to the Sasanian Empire. Frye notes that in the 3rd centuryAD such client states {{played an important role}} in RomanSasanian relations, but both empires gradually replaced them by an organized defense system run by the central government and based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> of fortifications (the limes) and the fortified frontier cities, such as Dara. Towards the end of the 1st centuryAD, Rome organized the protection of its eastern frontiers through the limes system, which lasted until the Muslim conquests of the 7th century after improvements by Diocletian. Like the Romans, the Sasanians constructed defensive walls opposite the territory of their opponents. According to R. N. Frye, it was under Shapur II that the Persian system was extended, probably in imitation of Diocletian's construction of the limes of the Syrian and Mesopotamian frontiers of the Roman Empire. The Roman and Persian border units were known as limitanei and marzobans, respectively.|$|E

That this was not a good tactic was proved when B3 narrowly avoided a torpedo from a German U-boat on the morning of 2 October. Nonetheless the scheme was successful and the BEF crossed to France without loss.|$|E
