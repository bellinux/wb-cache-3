50|$|The hyliotas are a genus, Hyliota, of {{passerine}} bird from Africa. The taxonomic {{position of}} the genus has been a longstanding mystery. They have been formerly regarded as Old World warblers in the Sylviidae family, or related to the batises and wattle-eyes in the family Platysteiridae, bush-shrikes in the family Malaconotidae, or even <b>Old-World</b> <b>flycatchers</b> in the family Muscicapidae. An analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of the genus and possible relatives found they have no close relatives and are basal in the clade Passerida. They are now often regarded as a family in their own right, Hyliotidae.|$|E
