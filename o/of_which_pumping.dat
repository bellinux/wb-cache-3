40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel micropump <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>pumping</b> mechanism {{is based upon}} magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) principles. MHD {{is the study of}} flow of electrically conducting liquids in electric and magnetic fields. Lorentz force is the pumping source of conductive, aqueous solutions in the MHD micropump. Conducting fluid in the microchannel of the MHD micropump is driven by Lorentz force in the direction perpendicular to both magnetic and electric fields. The performance of the micropump is obtained by measuring the pressure head difference and flow rate as the applied voltage changes from 10 to 60 VDC at 0. 19 and 0. 44 Tesla (T). The pressure head difference is 18 mm at 38 mA and the flow rate is 63 μl/min at 1. 8 mA when the inside diameter of inlet/outlet tube is 2 mm and the magnetic flux density is 0. 44 T. Bubble generation by the electrolysis of the conducting liquid can be observed. The performance of the MHD micropump obtained theoretically in single phase is compared with the experimental results. close 19621...|$|E

2500|$|Heath's time {{in office}} was as {{difficult}} as that of all British prime ministers in the 1970s. The government suffered an early blow {{with the death of}} Chancellor of the Exchequer Iain Macleod on 20 July 1970; his replacement was Anthony Barber. Heath's planned economic policy changes (including a significant shift from direct to indirect taxation) remained largely unimplemented: the Selsdon policy document was more or less abandoned as unemployment increased considerably by 1972. By January that year, the number of unemployed reached a million, the highest level for more than two decades. Opposed to unemployment on moral grounds, Heath encouraged a famous [...] "U-Turn" [...] in economic policy that precipitated {{what became known as the}} [...] "Barber boom". This was a two-range process involving the budgets of 1972 and 1973, the former <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>pumped</b> £2.5 billion into the economy in increased pensions and benefits and tax reductions. By early 1974, as a result of this Keynesian economic strategy, unemployment had fallen to under 550,000. The economic boom did not last, and the Heath government implemented various cuts that led to the abandonment of policy goals such as a planned expansion of nursery education.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Significant {{operational}} cost and energy savings {{can be achieved}} by optimising the schedules <b>of</b> <b>pumps,</b> <b>which</b> <b>pump</b> water from source reservoirs to storage tanks, in Water Distribution Networks. Despite the fact that Pump Scheduling Problem involves several conflictive objectives, few studies have considered multi-objective optimisation in terms of Pareto optimality. Our approach links a well-known multi-objective optimiser, SPEA 2, with a hydraulic simulator, EPANET, in order to provide a Pareto set of explicit schedules. Since only fixed speed pumps and fixed time intervals are considered, we use a natural binary representation and simple and straightforward initialisation and recombination operators. Unlike earlier studies, feasibility constraints are handled by a methodology based on the dominance relation rather than using penalty functions or reparation mechanisms. We test the proposed approach using a network instance and an assessment of the results is carried out by means of empirical attainment surfaces. The results show that the proposed approach is able to obtain better schedules than the stateof-the-art single-objective algorithm for this network instance and within the same number of function evaluations. ...|$|R
