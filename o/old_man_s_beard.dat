40|$|Reduced {{circulating}} testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) are implicated as {{risk factors}} for metabolic syndrome. As SHBG increases with age while testosterone declines, we examined the relative contributions of SHBG and testosterone {{to the risk of}} metabolic syndrome in <b>older</b> <b>men.</b> We conducted a cross-sectional study of 2502 community-dwelling men aged > or = 70 years without known diabetes. Metabolic syndrome was defined using the National Cholesterol Education Program-Third Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP-ATPIII) criteria. Early morning fasting sera were assayed for total testosterone, SHBG and LH. Free testosterone was calculated using mass action equations. There were 602 men with metabolic syndrome (24. 1 %). The risk of metabolic syndrome increased for total testosterone < 20 nmol/l, SHBG < 50 nmol/l and free testosterone < 300 pmol/l. In univariate analyses SHBG was associated with all five components of metabolic syndrome, total testosterone was associated with all except hypertension, and free testosterone was associated only with waist circumference and triglycerides. In multivariate analysis, both total testosterone and especially SHBG remained associated with metabolic syndrome, with odds ratios of 1. 34 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 18 - 1. 52) and 1. 77 (95 % CI: 1. 53 - 2. 06) respectively. Men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (total testosterone < 8 nmol/l, LH < or = 12 IU/l) had the highest prevalence of metabolic syndrome (53 %, P< 0. 001). Lower SHBG is more strongly associated with metabolic syndrome than lower total testosterone in community-dwelling <b>older</b> <b>men.</b> SHBG may be the primary driver of these relationships, possibly reflecting its relationship with insulin sensitivity. Further studies should examine whether measures that raise SHBG protect against the development of metabolic syndrome in <b>older</b> <b>men.</b> <b>S</b> A Paul Chubb, Zoë Hyde, Osvaldo P Almeida, Leon Flicker, Paul E Norman, Konrad Jamrozik, Graeme J Hankey and Bu B Yea...|$|R

40|$|Brain-Computer-Interfaces (BCI) are {{currently}} {{a subject of}} high interest {{in the field of}} rehabilitation technology. BCI will allow patients without control of their muscles to access certain functions of a computer, eg a speller for communication. Especially the possibility to establish methods of communication for the paralyzed is a main focus of BCI research. Among others, one common approach for Brain-Computer-Interfacing is the P 300 -Speller. It applies a modified Oddball-Paradigm to evoke a P 300 -Komponente, which is subsequently detected by automated means. Detection of the P 300 -Wave is connected to the related character, which is then displayed on a computer screen. The P 300 -Speller is an established method in laboratory research; still it is not yet applied in a clinical setting. Most applications and tests, using the P 300 -Speller, still take place in young, healthy subjects. This study investigates differences in the P 300 -Speller usability between male and female users as well as between young and old users. Under certain conditions, i. e. difficult conditions, robust and reproducible differences are found. Aged men are worse in their ability to use the speller than young men and women of both age groups. In a visual Oddball-Paradigm, bad performance in the P 300 -Speller is reflected in event-related EEG oscillations. Especially in the frequency bands associated with attention, the group with the worst performance shows less pronounced signals than the other experimental groups. It is concluded, that <b>older</b> <b>men</b> <b>s</b> attention is less pronounced than that in the other groups, effecting EEG-Oscillations and performance in the P 300 -Speller. A visual Oddball-Paradigm may be suitable as a predictor for a persons ability to use the P 300 -Speller...|$|R

40|$|The study {{investigated}} South African <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing involvement {{and the possible}} influences of {{various factors such as}} demographic characteristics, expenditure on clothing, the frequency of clothing purchases, store patronage and <b>men</b> <b>s</b> work dress code. A survey was conducted across Gauteng which is the largest retail hub in South Africa with mainly urban areas. Most consumers in Gauteng have access to different clothing retailers. Consulta Research, a professional research company assisted with data collection. Data was collected by means of convenient sampling. Online questionnaires were distributed to their data base and a total of 479 usable questionnaires were completed. Data analysis consisted of descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, ANOVA s, Chi square tests and other post hoc tests. The study confirmed that men clothing involvement is not equally strong for all four dimensions of clothing involvement that are distinguished in literature. Previous studies suggested that involvement should be studied from an age ordering perspective, and therefore respondents demographic characteristics were vital in terms of the analysis of the data. Certain demographic characteristics seemed to be good indicators of <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing involvement, namely age and marital status while factors such as work dress code surprisingly {{do not seem to be}} useful to predict <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing involvement. The majority of the sample spent less than 5 % of their monthly household income on clothing for themselves and indicated that they purchase clothing sporadically when necessary. Findings nevertheless indicated that expenditure on their clothing and frequency of clothing purchases are useful indicators of <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing involvement. Although younger men (generation Y) were more inclined to patronise specialised <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing retailers, irrespective of their work dress code, the majority of men patronised general retailers and department stores when purchasing their clothing. Findings confirm that consumption- and purchase involvement are the prevalent forms of clothing involvement that are relevant in terms of <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing behaviour. Indications are that <b>men</b> <b>s</b> advertising involvement is not particularly strong, which implies that they gain their product information and fashion information from alternative sources that rather relates to purchase involvement which tested high in most cases. This has implications for retail because <b>men</b> <b>s</b> stronger purchase involvement probably means that the physical retail environment is more important in terms of fashion information and to inspire <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing purchases. Therefore retailers should focus more on factors that make in-store decisions easier for males such as displays and placement of clothing. Male apparel is a potentially lucrative and growing market that can be even more profitable. Younger men spend more on their clothing therefore this group should therefore take preference but the <b>older</b> <b>men</b> should not be forgotten. Based on the findings of this study various recommendations are made with a large focus to either expand this study or build onto this existing research. Topics related to male clothing and involvement of clothing can definitely be built on and studied more in the apparel industry to fill a gap on knowledge that is lacking and should be explored further.
