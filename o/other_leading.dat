5|$|After {{the end of}} the First English Civil War Rupert was {{employed}} by the young King Louis XIV of France to fight the Spanish during the final years of the Thirty Years' War. Rupert's military employment was complicated by his promises to the Holy Roman Emperor that had led to his release from captivity in 1642, and his ongoing commitment to the English Royalist faction in exile. He also became a Knight of the Garter in 1642. Throughout the period Rupert was inconvenienced by his lack of secure income, and his ongoing feuds with <b>other</b> <b>leading</b> members of the Royalist circle.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{investigation}} {{did not find}} any considerable evidence linking Kocharyan to the Hunanyan group, many Armenian politicians and analysts believe that President Robert Kocharyan and National Security Minister Serzh Sargsyan were behind the assassination of Vazgen Sargsyan and <b>other</b> <b>leading</b> politicians. In January 2000, investigators alleged that several members of the President Robert Kocharian's inner circle may have been behind the October 27 shooting, promoting some opposition figures to call for Kocharian's resignation. However, Kocharyan gradually consolidated his power throughout the year to emerge as the most powerful figure in the country's leadership.|$|E
5|$|Diseases, accidents, hunters, automobiles, and {{starvation}} are the <b>other</b> <b>leading</b> {{causes of}} death. Juveniles show high mortality shortly after leaving their mothers, while still perfecting their hunting techniques. One study of 15 bobcats showed yearly survival rates for both sexes averaged 0.62, {{in line with}} other research suggesting rates of 0.56 to 0.67. Cannibalism has been reported; kittens may be taken when prey levels are low, but this is very rare and does not much influence the population.|$|E
5|$|In 1898 Muller {{travelled}} to South Africa, {{where he}} visited Cape Town, the Orange Free State, and the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek. In Pretoria {{he attended the}} inauguration of President Kruger and in Bloemfontein he struck up a friendship with the newly elected President M.T. Steyn and his family. He also renewed his relations with <b>other</b> <b>leading</b> statesmen, like former President F.W. Reitz, government secretary P.J. Blignaut, {{and chairman of the}} Volksraad C.H. Wessels. In Cape Town, he was granted an audience with High Commissioner Sir Alfred Milner.|$|E

5|$|King John I {{accepted}} Ottoman suzerainty in 1529, {{but in the}} Treaty of Nagyvárad of 1538 {{he conceded}} {{the right of the}} Habsburgs to succeed him after his death. At that point his voivodes, Stephen Majláth and Emeric Balassa, decided to separate Transylvania from the kingdom in order to save the province from an Ottoman invasion. Although <b>other</b> <b>leading</b> Transylvanian noblemen soon joined them, King John I overcame their rebellion in some weeks.|$|E

5|$|The robbery {{made the}} Bolsheviks even less popular in Georgia {{and left the}} Bolsheviks in Tiflis without {{effective}} leadership. After the death by natural causes of his wife Ekaterina Svanidze in November 1907, Stalin rarely returned to Tiflis. <b>Other</b> <b>leading</b> Bolsheviks in Georgia, such as Mikhail Tskhakaya and Filipp Makharadze, were largely absent from Georgia after 1907. Another prominent Tiflis Bolshevik, Stepan Shahumyan, moved to Baku. The Bolsheviks' popularity in Tiflis continued to fall, and by 1911, there were only about 100 Bolsheviks left in the city.|$|E
5|$|About {{forty years}} after Somairle's death, a Benedictine monastery was {{established}} on Iona. The monastery's foundation charter dates to December 1203, {{which suggests that}} Ragnall may {{have been responsible for}} its erection, as claimed by early modern tradition preserved in the eighteenth-century Book of Clanranald. Be that as it may, there is no hard evidence linking Ragnall to the house's foundation. Since the charter reveals that the monastery received substantial endowments from throughout the meic Somairle domain, the foundation appears to have been supported by <b>other</b> <b>leading</b> members the kindred, such as Dubgall himself (if he was still alive) or his son, Donnchad. The charter placed the monastery under the protection of Pope Innocent III (died 1216), which secured its episcopal independence from the Diocese of the Isles. However, the price for the privilege of Iona's papal protection appears to have been the adoption of the Benedictine Rule, and the supersession of the centuries-old institution of Colum Cille.|$|E
5|$|After Cameron retires, Keating hires Roark, whom Francon soon fires {{for refusing}} to design a {{building}} in the classical style. Roark works briefly at another firm, then opens his own office but has trouble finding clients and closes it down. He gets {{a job in a}} granite quarry owned by Francon. There he meets Francon's daughter Dominique, a columnist for The New York Banner, while she is staying at her family's estate nearby. They are immediately attracted to each <b>other,</b> <b>leading</b> to a rough sexual encounter that Dominique later calls a rape. Shortly after, Roark is notified that a client is ready to start a new building, and he returns to New York. Dominique also returns to New York and learns Roark is an architect. She attacks his work in public, but visits him for secret sexual encounters.|$|E

50|$|Another {{problem with}} water is that light {{attenuation}} {{is a function}} of the wavelength. This means that different color get attenuated faster than <b>others,</b> <b>leading</b> to color degradation. Red and orange light is the first to get attenuated, followed by yellows and greens. Blue is the less attenuated wavelength.|$|R
5|$|As {{the civil}} disobedience {{campaign}} {{spread to other}} parts of the north-east, Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike accused ITAK of trying to establish a separate state. In April 1961 the satyagrahas were removed by the army using brutal force. A state of emergency was declared on 18 April 1961. ITAK was banned, and its MPs and <b>other</b> <b>leading</b> members arrested and imprisoned at Panagoda Cantonment. Chelvanayakam was allowed to leave the camp and return home due to his deteriorating health. Chelvanayakam suffered from Parkinson's disease and his hearing had been gradually failing. After initially refusing, Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike allowed Chelvanayakam to travel to the UK to undergo surgery in Edinburgh at the hands of a neurosurgeon Francis John Gillingham. The operation was successful and after a few months recuperating in London Chelvanayakam returned to Ceylon.|$|E
5|$|Author Charles Higham {{claimed that}} Anthony Blunt, an MI5 agent and Soviet spy, acting on {{orders from the}} British royal family, made a {{successful}} secret trip to Schloss Friedrichshof in Germany {{towards the end of}} the war to retrieve sensitive letters between the Duke of Windsor and Adolf Hitler and <b>other</b> <b>leading</b> Nazis. What is certain is that George VI sent the Royal Librarian, Owen Morshead, accompanied by Blunt, then working part-time in the Royal Library as well as for British intelligence, to Friedrichshof in March 1945 to secure papers relating to the German Empress Victoria, the eldest child of Queen Victoria. Looters had stolen part of the castle's archive, including surviving letters between daughter and mother, as well as other valuables, some of which were recovered in Chicago after the war. The papers rescued by Morshead and Blunt, and those returned by the American authorities from Chicago, were deposited in the Royal Archives.|$|E
5|$|Carucage was {{an attempt}} to secure new sources of revenue to {{supplement}} existing sources of income. It was also intended to increase the royal revenues in the face of new demands placed upon them. Although derived from the older geld, carucage was an experiment in revenue collection, but it was only levied for specific purposes, rather than as a general tax regularly assessed. A novel feature was the consultation with the barons and <b>other</b> <b>leading</b> members of the ruling classes. Despite its intermittent use during the reigns of Richard I, John, and the early years of Henry III, the main source of royal income at that time remained scutage, feudal dues such as feudal reliefs or feudal aids, and royal rights such as the profits from the justice system.|$|E
50|$|Seasons 1 through 5 {{each have}} 13 episodes. Season 6 only has 8 episodes. It was {{explained}} that season 6 has less episodes than other seasons because the filming decision {{for a season}} 6 was made later than the <b>others,</b> <b>leading</b> to less footage and materials being available.|$|R

5|$|Colonel Nghia {{showed his}} mixed {{feelings}} about the junta with the selective use of his armored troops. They supported Khánh's move against Dinh, Don, Kim and Xuan, but tried to protect Minh by using tanks to shield Minh's house from Lam's Civil Guard units, which were also used to arrest the four <b>other</b> <b>leading</b> junta members. Although Minh was taken away, this was {{claimed to be a}} protective measure to shield him from some of Khánh's more hawkish supporters, and he was never formally arrested and taken into detention. Throughout the morning the deposed officers were taken one by one to JGS headquarters by the plotters. The generals were then flown to My Khe beach, near Da Nang.|$|E
5|$|Following Nazi Germany's collapse, the SS {{ceased to}} exist. Numerous {{members of the}} SS, many of them still {{committed}} Nazis, remained at large in Germany and across Europe. On 21 May 1945, the British captured Himmler, who was in disguise and using a false passport. At an internment camp near Lüneburg, he committed suicide by biting down on a cyanide capsule. Several <b>other</b> <b>leading</b> members of the SS fled, but some were quickly captured. Kaltenbrunner, chief of the RSHA and the highest-ranking surviving SS main department chief upon Himmler's suicide, was captured and arrested in the Bavarian Alps. He was among the 24 defendants put on trial at the International Military Tribunal in 1945–46.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, he {{reconciled}} with Breton, and sporadically attended the Surrealists' meetings in Paris. The same year, he issued the poetry book De nos oiseaux ("Of Our Birds").

By then, it was also announced that Tzara had started work on a screenplay. In 1930, he directed and produced a cinematic version of Le Cœur à barbe, starring Breton and <b>other</b> <b>leading</b> Surrealists. Five years later, he signed his name to The Testimony against Gertrude Stein, published by Eugene Jolas's magazine transition in reply to Stein's memoir The Autobiography of Alice B.
