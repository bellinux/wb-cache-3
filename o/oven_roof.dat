In 1978 the EPA Carcinogen Assessment Group (CAG) was asked by the EPA Office of Mobile Sources to do an assessment of the carcinogenic risks to the general public of diesel exhausts on the assumption that 25 % of the automobile fleet in the USA was equipped with diesel engines. Given the lack of animal or epidemiological data, the approach taken by the CAG was to base the risk assessment on human carcinogenic risks from exposure to organic combustion products (coke <b>oven</b> workers, <b>roofing</b> tar applicators and cigarette smokers) with the comparative potency of diesel particulates and the other materials to be established by short-term bioassays. This approach launched a substantial research program in the EPA. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to evaluate the comparative potency data acquired thus far. The study design, sample generation, collection and preparation are presented elsewhere (1). The diesel, coke <b>oven</b> and <b>roofing</b> tar particulates were Soxhlet-extracted with dichloromethane. The cigarette smoke tar was removed from the smok...|$|R

50|$|Despite her family's {{intellectual}} {{prominence in}} the field of science, Eva Striker always felt a deep attraction towards art. At 17, Zeisel entered Budapest's Magyar Képzőművészeti Akadémia (Hungarian Royal Academy of Fine Arts) as a painter. However, to support her painting, she eventually decided to pursue a more practical profession and apprenticed herself to Jakob Karapancsik, the last pottery master in the medieval guild system. From him she learned ceramics from the ground up. After graduating as a journeyman she found work with German ceramic manufacturers. She was the first woman to qualify as a journeyman in the Hungarian Guild of Chimney Sweeps, <b>Oven</b> Makers, <b>Roof</b> Tilers, Well Diggers and Potters.|$|R

60|$|Ovens.--Bedouin Oven.--Dig {{a hole in}} the ground; {{wall and}} roof it with stones, leaving small {{apertures}} in the top. They make a roaring fire in and about the <b>oven</b> (the <b>roof</b> having been temporarily removed for the purpose), and when the stones (including those of the roof) have become very hot, sweep away the ashes and strew the inside of the oven with grass, or leaves, taking care that whatever is used, has no disagreeable taste, else it would be communicated to the flesh. Then put in the meat: it is a common plan to sew it up in its own skin, which shields it from dust {{and at the same time}} retains its juices from evaporating. Now replace the roof, a matter of some difficulty, on account of the stones being hot, and therefore requiring previous rehearsal. Lastly, make the fire again over the oven and let the baking continue for some hours. An entire sheep can be baked easily in this way. The same process is used for baking vegetables, except with the addition of pouring occasionally boiling water upon them, through the roof.|$|R
40|$|Complex {{mixtures}} of polycyclic organic matter (POM) {{are used to}} illustrate the scientific problems and issues associated with characterizing the comparative risk of related complex mixtures. The complexity of mixtures in which the active components are not well characterized present special challenges, which include identifying the critical components of mixtures, their sources, and the appropriate biomarker(s) of exposure and dose; developing the appropriate experimental models for dose-response assessment; species extrapolation; and developing a scientific basis for predicting from one mixture to another. Strategies for addressing these issues include bioassay-directed chemical characterization of bioactive components of complex mixtures, apportionment methods to determine the source of biological activity and risk, DNA adduct methods to determine tissue exposure and target dose of mixtures, and comparative approaches to determining the relative similarity, potency, and risk of complex mixtures. Epidemiological data are available for humans exposed to POM from coke <b>ovens,</b> coal <b>roofing</b> tar, coal smoke, aluminum smelters, and cigarette smoke. These emissions are characterized and compared to POM from automotive emissions (diesel and gasoline), woodstove emissions, residential oil furnace emissions, and ambient air particles.

40|$|Extracts of soots {{obtained}} {{from various sources}} were applied to the skin of mice {{in an effort to}} identify carcinogens in these mixtures and to link these materials to the etiology of human cancer. Samples of coal chimney soot, coke oven materials, industrial carbon black, oil shale soot, and gasoline vehicle exhaust materials have been examined by this method. The studies reported here have been constructed to compare the carcinogenic and tumorigenic potency of extracts from various particulate emissions: coke ovens, diesel and gasoline vehicles and a roofing tar pot. Automobile emission samples were obtained by collecting the diluted and cooled exhaust on Teflon-coated glass fiber filters. Coke <b>oven</b> and <b>roofing</b> tar samples were particulate emission samples collected by impaction and filtration. The organic components associated with each of the particles were extracted with dichloromethane and dermally applied to SENCAR mice. All agents were applied as tumor initiators by using a five-dose protocol. Selected extracts were also applied as complete carcinogens and as tumor promotors. Statistical analyses of the resulting tumor data were performed by using nonlinear Poisson and probit models. The results from these experiments provide a suitable data base for comparative potency estimation of complex mixtures...|$|R
