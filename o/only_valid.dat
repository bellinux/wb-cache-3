5|$|An ideal {{surface is}} flat, rigid, {{perfectly}} smooth, and chemically homogeneous, and has zero contact angle hysteresis. Zero hysteresis implies the advancing and receding contact angles are equal. In other words, only one thermodynamically stable contact angle exists. When {{a drop of}} liquid is placed on such a surface, the characteristic contact angle is formed as depicted in Fig. 1. Furthermore, on an ideal surface, the drop will return to its original shape if it is disturbed. The following derivations apply only to ideal solid surfaces; they are <b>only</b> <b>valid</b> for the state in which the interfaces are not moving and the phase boundary line exists in equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|A {{fundamental}} {{influence on}} Durkheim's {{thought was the}} sociological positivism of Auguste Comte, who effectively sought to extend and apply the scientific method found in the natural sciences to the social sciences. According to Comte, a true social science should stress for empirical facts, as well as induce general scientific laws from the relationship among these facts. There were many points on which Durkheim agreed with the positivist thesis. First, he accepted {{that the study of}} society was to be founded on an examination of facts. Second, like Comte, he acknowledged that the <b>only</b> <b>valid</b> guide to objective knowledge was the scientific method. Third, he agreed with Comte that the social sciences could become scientific only when they were stripped of their metaphysical abstractions and philosophical speculation. At the same time, Durkheim believed that Comte was still too philosophical in his outlook.|$|E

France officially protested this issue, while the Belgian government noted that the French mint sells souvenir medals at Waterloo. After 180,000 coins were minted but not released, the issue was melted. Instead, Belgium issued an identical commemorative coin in the non-standard value of 2½ Euros. Legally <b>only</b> <b>valid</b> within the issuing country (but unlikely to circulate) it was minted in brass, packaged, and sold by the Belgian mint for 6 Euros.

5|$|In 1989, the palaeontologists Spencer G. Lucas and Jay C. Sobus {{published}} {{a revision of}} indricothere taxa, which is followed by most western scientists today. They concluded that Paraceratherium, as the oldest name, was the <b>only</b> <b>valid</b> indricothere genus from the Oligocene, and contained four valid species, P. bugtiense, P. transouralicum, P. prohorovi, and P. orgosensis. They considered most other names to be junior synonyms of those taxa, or as dubious names, based on remains too fragmentary to identify properly. By analysing alleged differences between named genera and species, Lucas and Sobus found that these most likely represented variation within populations, and that most features were indistinguishable between specimens, as had been {{pointed out in the}} 1930s. The fact that the single skull assigned to P. transouralicum or Indricotherium was domed, while others were flat at the top was attributed to sexual dimorphism. Therefore, it is possible that P. bugtiense fossils represent the female, while P. transouralicum represents the male of the same species.|$|E

5|$|In his 1880 {{article about}} extinct cats, Cope also named a third species of Smilodon, S.gracilis. The species {{was based on}} a partial canine, which had been {{obtained}} in a cave near the Schuylkill River in Pennsylvania. Cope found the canine to be distinct from that of the other Smilodon species due to its smaller size and more compressed base. Its specific name refers to the species' lighter build. This species is known from fewer and less complete remains than {{the other members of the}} genus. S.gracilis has at times been considered part of genera such as Megantereon and Ischyrosmilus. S.populator, S.fatalis and S.gracilis are currently considered the <b>only</b> <b>valid</b> species of Smilodon, and features used to define most of their junior synonyms have been dismissed as variation between individuals of the same species (intraspecific variation). One of the most famous of prehistoric mammals, Smilodon has often been featured in popular media and is the state fossil of California.|$|E
5|$|Polycystic {{kidney disease}} (PKD) is a slowly {{progressive}} disease affecting Persian and Persian-related breeds, in which fluid-filled cysts expand within the kidneys, destroying functional tissue. While renal cysts are observed {{with a low}} incidence in Maine Coons, PKD {{appears to be a}} misnomer in this particular breed. In a recent study spanning 8 years, renal cysts were documented by ultrasound in 7 of 187 healthy Maine Coons enrolled in a pre-breeding screening programme. The cysts were mostly single and unilateral (6/7, 85.7%) small (mean 3.6mm in diameter) and located at corticomedullary junction (4/6, 66.7%), thus different in size, numbers and location from those observed in Persian-related breeds. In the same study, not only did all six Maine Coon cats with renal cysts test negative for the PKD1 mutation, proving the disease in these cats to be unrelated to the PKD observed in Persians and related breeds, but gene sequencing of these cats failed to demonstrate any common genetic sequences. The presence of renal cysts, in the absence of other changes, does not appear to negatively impact the patients' quality of life, as those for which follow-up was available were reported alive and well in adulthood. Although the exact nature and clinical relevance of renal cysts in Maine Coons is currently unknown, its screening is still recommended for pre-breeding assessment. Ultrasonography is currently the <b>only</b> <b>valid</b> diagnostic method for its detection in this breed.|$|E
5|$|The sum {{argument}} {{advanced by}} the JWP in {{the approval of}} the discovery of nihonium was later criticized in a May 2016 study from Lund University and the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research, as it is <b>only</b> <b>valid</b> if no gamma decay or internal conversion takes place along the decay chain, which is not likely for odd nuclei, and the uncertainty of the alpha decay energies measured in the 278Nh decay chain was not small enough to rule out this possibility; and if this is the case, similarity in lifetimes of intermediate daughters become a meaningless argument, as different isomers of the same nuclide can have wildly different half-lives (the ground state of 180Ta has a half-life of mere hours, but an excited state 180mTa has never been observed to decay). However, although this study found reason to doubt and criticize the IUPAC approval of the discoveries of moscovium and tennessine, the data from RIKEN for nihonium was found to be congruent, and the data from the Dubna team for moscovium and nihonium to probably be so, thus necessitating no criticism of the IUPAC approval of the discovery of element 113.|$|E
