We are not related to the apartment bombings in Moscow and Volgodonsk, but we can take responsibility for this in an acceptable way.|$|E

That lasts for almost two hours." [...] Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film isn't the same without Arnold Schwarzenegger and that it misses its {{dramatic}} element. Likewise, Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film a 2/4 and called it [...] "predictable" [...] with the [...] "dramatic elements flat-lin". She considered Christian Bale's performance [...] "one-dimensional", but found his co-stars to [...] "come off better", saying Sam Worthington had [...] "a quiet intensity marred only by yelling [...] "Nooooo!" [...] three times in about 10 minutes" [...] and that Anton Yelchin had [...] "some of the best lines".|$|E
500|$|Harriet Fane married Rt Hon Charles Arbuthnot, {{member of}} Parliament, at Fulbeck on 31 January 1814. [...] Born in 1767, {{her husband was}} 26 {{years older than she}} was, an age {{difference}} which had initially caused her family to object to the marriage. Another of the principal obstacles to finalising the arrangements for the marriage was financial. Her widowed mother delegated the arrangements for the marriage of her 20-year-old daughter to her elder son Vere, a 46-year-old widower who was considered qualified in these matters as he worked at Child's Bank. [...] It seems that Vere Fane and his mother were not initially prepared to settle enough money on his sister to satisfy her future husband, causing the prospective bridegroom to write to his fiancée: [...] "How can you and I live upon £1000 or £1200 and Fane [...] finds it so impossible to live upon her £6000 that she can <b>offer</b> <b>you</b> no assistance whatsoever?" ...|$|E

500|$|The inquest {{was opened}} by Leonard Gorodkin at Manchester Coroner's Court on 8 January 1993. Dr William Lawler, a Home Office pathologist, testified that Capper had {{suffered}} 75—80 per cent burns consistent with having had petrol thrown {{over her and}} set alight, and that her chance of survival had been minimal. [...] "It {{was clear from the}} outset that Suzanne was unlikely to survive. She suffered widespread burns that led to several complications internally." [...] Death was due to complications caused by these burns. The coroner said: [...] "It is clear that this young girl must have suffered a great deal of pain and had no chance of survival. But she did fortunately survive long enough to give information which led to the people mentioned being charged with her death." [...] To Capper's mother and stepfather the coroner said: [...] "I <b>offer</b> <b>you,</b> not just on my behalf but on behalf of the whole nation, my very deepest sympathy and condolences at this tragic happening to your young daughter." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{underlying}} {{theme of}} [...] "City of Blinding Lights," [...] {{reflected in the}} chorus, is lost innocence. The theme was reinforced during an impromptu concert at Empire–Fulton Ferry State Park under the Brooklyn Bridge; Bono introduced the song by reminiscing about {{the first time the}} band arrived in New York City, calling it [...] "a song about innocence and naïvete." [...] Bono developed the opening stanza from a memory of his first trip to London with his future wife, Alison Stewart, when they were teenagers. The experience of walking through Piccadilly Circus and along Wardour Street put him in mind of [...] "discovering what a big city could <b>offer</b> <b>you</b> and what it could take away." [...] Although the first verse is set in London, the chorus is set in New York City. The verse, [...] "I've seen you walk unafraid / I've seen you in the clothes you've made / Can you see the beauty inside of me? / What happened to the beauty I had inside of me?" [...] was written as an expression of love for Alison, with a reflection on their life together as they grow older.|$|E

Parthiban, was ranked at number 8 in the magazine's list of the 13 Cheesiest, Chalkiest Lines in Indian Cinema. In April 2012, Rediff.com included the film in its list The A to Z of Tamil Cinema. In a January 2015 interview with The Times of India, playwright Y. G. Mahendra said, [...] "most character artists today lack variety [...] Show me one actor in India currently who can do a Kattabomman, a VOC, a Vietnam Veedu, a Galatta Kalyanam and a Thiruvilayadal." [...] Actor Rana Daggubati, {{in an interview with}} Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu, said that Ganesan's performances as Kattabomman and Karna (in the 1964 film Karnan) served as inspirations for his role in [...] (2015). The scene between Ganesan and Parthiban was later featured in the 2016 film Jackson Durai, which was titled after Parthiban's character. M. Sasikumar's Balle Vellaiyathevaa, released in the same year, was named after a dialogue uttered by Ganesan's character.|$|E
