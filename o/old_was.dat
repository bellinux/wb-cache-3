5|$|Any hope of {{resistance}} was centered on two young princes, Emperor Gong's brothers. The older boy, Zhao Shi, who {{was nine years}} <b>old,</b> <b>was</b> declared emperor on June 14, 1276, in Fuzhou. The court sought refuge in Quanzhou, seeking an alliance with the Superintendent of Maritime Shipping, the Muslim Pu Shougeng. However, he secretly formed an alliance with Kublai, so the Song court was forced to flee in 1277. The court then sought refuge in Silvermine Bay (Mui Wo) on Lantau Island. The older brother became ill and died on May 8, 1278 at age ten, and was succeeded by his younger brother who became Emperor Huaizong of Song, aged seven. The Sung Wong Toi monument in Kowloon commemorates his enthronement. On March 19, 1279 the Song army was defeated in its last battle, the Battle of Yamen, fought against the Yuan army led by the Chinese general Zhang Hongfan in the Pearl River Delta. Song Prime Minister Lu Xiufu {{is said to have}} taken the boy emperor in his arms and jumped from his sinking ship into the sea, drowning both of them.|$|E
5|$|Horatio Nelson {{was born}} on 29 September 1758 in a rectory in Burnham Thorpe, Norfolk, England, the sixth of eleven {{children}} of the Reverend Edmund Nelson and his wife Catherine Suckling.

His mother, who died on 26 December 1767, when he was nine years <b>old,</b> <b>was</b> a great-niece of Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford, the de facto first Prime Minister of Great Britain. She lived {{in the village of}} Barsham, Suffolk, and married the Reverend Edmund Nelson at Beccles church, Suffolk, in 1749.

5|$|In 1892, Cope (then 52years <b>old)</b> <b>was</b> granted expense {{money for}} field {{work from the}} Texas Geological Survey.

In the 1890s, his publication rate increased to an average of 43articles a year. His final expedition to the West took place in 1894, when he prospected for dinosaurs in South Dakota and visited sites in Texas and Oklahoma. The same year, Julia was married to William H. Collins, a Haverford astronomy professor. The couple's ages—Julia was 28 and the groom 35—were past the conventions of Victorian marriage. After their European honeymoon, the couple returned to Haverford. While Annie moved to Haverford, as well, Cope did not. His official reason was the long commute and late lectures he gave in Philadelphia. In private correspondence, however, Osborn wrote that the two had essentially separated, though they remained on amiable terms.|$|E
