5|$|The routing of VT17 varies greatly <b>on</b> <b>opposite</b> {{sides of}} the Bristol town center. West of Bristol, the route passes through {{generally}} level terrain and connects multiple communities. East of Bristol, VT17 is more mountainous and more rural in nature.|$|E
5|$|The two armies met <b>on</b> <b>opposite</b> {{banks of}} the River Bug. Yaroslav's forces may have taken {{position}} with archers covering the crossing points. Bolesław {{seems to have taken}} his time, allowing his army to rest, and started work on makeshift bridges. The Battle of the River Bug finally occurred around July 23.|$|E
50|$|Developments nearby {{include the}} large Masshouse {{development}} <b>on</b> the <b>opposite</b> side of The Priory Queensway and City Park Gate <b>opposite</b> <b>on</b> the Moor Street Queensway. Cannon House <b>on</b> the <b>opposite</b> side of Old Square recently underwent a major refurbishment into Grade A office space.|$|R
50|$|The closest {{practicable}} motorway {{and rail}} links with Rome lie around 5 and 8 km to the east, respectively, <b>on</b> <b>opposites</b> {{sides of the}} Tiber. Via Provinciale Capena Bivio (SP17a) connects the E35 Class-A road with Capena.|$|R
50|$|The pitches sit on top {{of former}} water reservoirs: The sports pitches <b>on</b> Whitham Road <b>opposite</b> Weston Park Hospital are the site of Godfrey Dam, built in 1790 and {{extended}} in 1853. <b>On</b> the <b>opposite</b> side of Northumberland Road was New Dam built in 1787 and enlarged in 1809. Nearer Crookesmoor Road alongside Narrow Walk were Ralphs and Misfortune Dams, with Butchers Dam <b>on</b> the <b>opposite</b> side of Northumberland Road.|$|R
5|$|A {{pendulum}} hangs straight downwards in a symmetrical gravitational field. However, if {{a sufficiently}} large mass {{such as a}} mountain is nearby, its gravitational attraction should pull the pendulum's plumb-bob slightly out of true. The change in plumb-line angle against a known objectsuch as a starcould be carefully measured <b>on</b> <b>opposite</b> sides of the mountain. If {{the mass of the}} mountain could be independently established from a determination of its volume and an estimate of the mean density of its rocks, then these values could be extrapolated to provide the mean density of the Earth, and by extension, its mass.|$|E
5|$|A {{resolution}} to this apparent inconsistency {{is offered by}} inflationary theory in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently <b>on</b> <b>opposite</b> sides of the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows {{from the fact that}} this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.|$|E
5|$|A ship {{received}} {{by a pair}} of induction coils hung <b>on</b> <b>opposite</b> sides of the ship, and fed through an amplifier into a headset (see diagram, below). By switching between coils, the relative strength of the signal on each side could be compared. The ship maintained a course parallel to the cable by maneuvering to keep the signal strength constant.|$|E
50|$|<b>On</b> the <b>opposite</b> side of {{the road}} are Deanery Garden and St Andrew's Church. Close by, just over Sonning Bridge, is The Mill at Sonning, now a dinner theatre. <b>On</b> the <b>opposite</b> Oxfordshire bank of the Thames is another {{riverside}} hotel and restaurant, The French Horn.|$|R

5000|$|There's {{limited time}} for band music, but Milligan and Edgington play <b>on</b> <b>opposites</b> {{sides of a}} bombed out floor. Shortly after Edgington finishes, the piano falls through. Milligan reflects: [...] "It's not often we had been {{detailed}} to:—'Clean up that mess of a French Colonial Piano.'" ...|$|R
5|$|Because a Leslie speaker modifies {{as well as}} amplifies the sound, {{the output}} cannot simply be {{connected}} to a larger PA system if the volume onstage from the built-in amplifier is too quiet. This is particularly problematic for an older Leslie like the 122 or 147, which only has a 40 watt RMS power amplifier. Instead, microphones are placed around the Leslie, and the output from these {{is connected to the}} PA. A typical setup for onstage miking is to use two microphones placed <b>on</b> <b>opposite</b> sides of the horn and a single microphone on the drum.|$|E
5|$|By 1:00 pm, the two fleets were roughly {{facing each}} other, but sailing <b>on</b> <b>opposite</b> tacks. In order to engage, {{and to avoid}} some shoals (known as the Middle Ground) {{near the mouth of}} the bay, Graves around 2:00 pm ordered his whole fleet to wear, a {{manoeuvre}} that reversed his line of battle, but enabled it to line up with the French fleet as its ships exited the bay. This placed the squadron of Hood, his most aggressive commander, {{at the rear of the}} line, and that of Admiral Francis Samuel Drake in the van.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{were made}} between Lander's Peak and The Heart of the Andes, a {{contemporary}} painting {{by one of}} Bierstadt's main rivals in the landscape genre, Frederic Edwin Church. The two works represented the two great mountain ranges spanning North and South America. At the New York Metropolitan Fair in 1864, held by the United States Sanitary Commission {{to raise money for}} the Union war effort, the two paintings were exhibited opposite each other. Lander's Peak and The Heart of the Andes are still exhibited <b>on</b> <b>opposite</b> walls at their current location at the Metropolitan.|$|E

5|$|De Lacy {{witnessed}} charters of the Empress in 1141. During {{the later}} 1140s, de Lacy {{was able to}} recover many of his father's Welsh marcher lands, {{and one of his}} efforts at Ludlow was later embroidered in the medieval romance Fouke le Fitz Waryn. He and Miles of Gloucester were claimants to many of the same lands, and during Stephen's reign were generally <b>on</b> <b>opposite</b> sides of the succession dispute. In June 1153, de Lacy was in the company of Matilda's son, Henry fitzEmpress, who became King Henry II of England in 1154.|$|E
5|$|Frome {{town centre}} {{contains}} {{a considerable number}} of independent shops, and a few chain stores. Retail is primarily aimed at serving the local population's requirements for food (there are two large supermarkets <b>on</b> <b>opposite</b> edges of the town, and three smaller supermarkets in the town centre), basic clothing, health and beauty, DIY and some electrical goods. However studies show that only {{about a quarter of the}} town's population do their non-food shopping in the town. Banks and building societies have branches in the town centre.|$|E
5|$|I-190 and NY 324 follow {{parallel}} routings across Grand Island, {{with both}} roads passing <b>on</b> <b>opposite</b> sides of Fantasy Island, a local amusement park, {{near the center}} of the island. At the northern edge of the island, NY324, as signed, terminates at exit20; however, officially, NY324 rejoins I-190 across the Niagara River once again via the North Grand Island Bridge. Now in Niagara Falls, Niagara County, NY324 ends at a complex interchange featuring NY384, the Niagara Scenic Parkway, and the LaSalle Expressway on the eastern bank of the river. Farther north, I-190 meets U.S. Route62 (US62) at exit22 and NY182 at exit23.|$|E

5|$|In 1851 the Florida Legislature {{voted to}} {{establish}} two seminaries {{of higher education}} <b>on</b> <b>opposite</b> sides of the Suwannee River. Francis W. Eppes and other city leaders established an all-male academy called the Florida Institute in Tallahassee as a legislative inducement to locate the West Florida Seminary in Tallahassee. The East Florida Seminary opened in Ocala in 1853, closed in 1861, and reopened in Gainesville in 1866. The East Florida Seminary is the institution to which the modern University of Florida traces its foundation.|$|E
5|$|The Caltech–MIT rivalry is {{a college}} rivalry between California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), {{stemming}} from the colleges' reputations as the top science and engineering schools in the United States. The rivalry is unusual given the geographic distance between the schools (their campuses are separated by about 3000 miles and are <b>on</b> <b>opposite</b> coasts of the United States), {{as well as its}} focus on elaborate pranks rather than sporting events.|$|E
5|$|The Continental Divide of North America runs diagonally {{through the}} southwestern {{part of the}} park. The divide is a {{topographic}} feature that separates Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean water drainages. About {{one third of the}} park lies {{on the west side of}} the divide. The origins of the Yellowstone and Snake Rivers are near each other but <b>on</b> <b>opposite</b> sides of the divide. As a result, the waters of the Snake River flow to the Pacific Ocean, while those of the Yellowstone find their way to the Atlantic Ocean via the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E

5|$|The Texas Tornado {{held the}} Intercontinental Championship {{for almost three}} months before {{dropping}} it back to Perfect on November 19. The match was aired on the December 15 edition of WWF Superstars. The two men were also <b>on</b> <b>opposite</b> sides for an elimination match at Survivor Series. Perfect eliminated the Tornado with a PerfectPlex, but the Tornado's team won the match. Brutus Beefcake did not wrestle again until 1993.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the French in the south {{threatened}} existing trade links that Carolina colonists had established into the interior, creating tension among all three powers. France and Spain, allies in this conflict, had been <b>on</b> <b>opposite</b> sides of the recently ended Nine Years' War. Conflicting territorial claims between Carolina and Florida south of the Savannah River were overlaid by animosity over religious divisions between the Roman Catholic Spanish and the Protestant English along the coast.|$|E
