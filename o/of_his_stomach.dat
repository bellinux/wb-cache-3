5|$|Smith {{returned}} to the United States in March 1949. Truman offered him the post of Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs but General Smith declined the appointment, preferring to return to military duty. He was appointed as {{the commander of the}} First Army at Fort Jay, New York, his first command since 1918. Throughout the war, Smith had been troubled by a recurring stomach ulcer. The problem became severe in 1949. He was no longer able eat a normal diet, and he was suffering from malnutrition. Smith was admitted to the Walter Reed Army Hospital, where the surgeons decided to remove most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach.</b> This did cure his ulcer, but Smith remained malnourished and thin.|$|E
500|$|After {{recovering}} from a life-threatening illness in which surgeons removed 95 percent <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach,</b> Kizirian entered {{a career in the}} Postal Service. He first returned to the Providence post office as a substitute clerk. In 1954, he was appointed foreman, the first of several promotions he received throughout his life. In 1961, he was made Postmaster of Providence by President John F. Kennedy. Congress unanimously confirmed the appointment. At age 36, Kizirian was one of the youngest postmasters in the country. During his tenure, Kizirian was instrumental in establishing the first automated post office. The Providence post office would be an exemplary model for post offices around the world. Kizirian later remarked, [...] "There is no nation on this earth that didn't send representatives to see the new post office." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} that Pausch gave the lecture, he was a {{pancreatic}} cancer patient. In an interview, Pausch stated that he had felt bloated, and learned {{that he had a}} cancerous tumor when doctors performed a CT Scan to check for gallstones. He then underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy surgery (or the [...] "Whipple procedure") to try to stop the growth of the cancerous tumor in his body, which later proved to be unsuccessful. The doctors removed his gall bladder, parts of his small intestine, a third of his pancreas, and parts <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach,</b> and proceeded to begin an experimental radiation treatment that could possibly increase his chances of survival for another 5 years to 45 percent. Pausch began the radiation treatments in November 2006 and stopped in May 2007, and felt that he was in good health after finishing. In July and August, tests conducted at Johns Hopkins University showed that Pausch was free of cancer. However, in late August of that year, Pausch informed readers of his website that his cancer had returned, saying: [...] "A recent CT scan showed that there are 10 tumors in my liver, and my spleen is also peppered with small tumors. The doctors say that {{it is one of the}} most aggressive recurrences they have ever seen." [...] The doctors estimated Pausch had three to six months of good health left to live.|$|E

500|$|McKinley {{had been}} given nutritive enemas; on September 11, he took some broth by mouth. [...] When it seemed to do him good, the {{following}} morning they allowed him toast, coffee, and chicken broth. [...] His subsequent pain was diagnosed as indigestion; he was given purgatives and most doctors left after their evening consultation. [...] In the early morning of September 13, McKinley suffered a collapse. [...] Urgent word to return to Buffalo was sent to Vice President Roosevelt, [...] from the nearest telegraph or telephone in the Adirondack wilderness; a park ranger was sent to find him. [...] Specialists were summoned; although at first some doctors hoped that McKinley might survive with a weakened heart, by afternoon they knew the case was hopeless. As yet unknown to the doctors, gangrene was growing on the walls <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach</b> and toxins were passing into his blood. [...] McKinley drifted {{in and out of}} consciousness all day; when awake he was the model patient. [...] By evening, McKinley too knew he was dying, [...] "It is useless, gentlemen. I think we ought to have prayer." [...] His friends and family were admitted, and the First Lady sobbed over him, [...] "I want to go, too. [...] I want to go, too." [...] Her husband replied, [...] "We are all going, we are all going. [...] God's will be done, not ours" [...] and with final strength put an arm around her. [...] He may also have sung part of his favorite hymn, [...] "Nearer, My God, to Thee", although other accounts have her singing it softly to him. [...] Ida McKinley was led away, her place briefly taken by Senator Hanna. [...] Morgan recounts their final encounter, [...] "Sometime that terrible evening, Mark Hanna had approached the bedside, tears standing in his eyes, his hands and head shaking in disbelief that thirty years of friendship could end thus." [...] When a tentative, formal greeting gained no coherent response, Hanna [...] "cried out over the years of friendship, 'William, William, don't you know me?'" ...|$|E

In a statement made on May 28, Swayze said he continued to respond well to treatment at Stanford University Medical Center.

5000|$|We are {{compelled}} {{to conclude that the}} proceedings by which this conviction was obtained do more than offend some fastidious squeamishness or private sentimentalism about combatting crime too energetically. This is conduct that shocks the conscience. Illegally breaking into the privacy of the petitioner, the struggle to open his mouth and remove what was there, the forcible extraction <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach's</b> contents — this course of proceeding by agents of government to obtain evidence is bound to offend even hardened sensibilities. They are methods too close to the rack and the screw to permit of constitutional differentiation.|$|R

She said they both expected he would fully recover after [...] "a long road ahead". Following his arrest, his attorney, William E. Moore, told reporters Snuka has dementia, stemming from wrestling-related injuries, {{to the point of being}} unfit for trial, and a judge ultimately agreed.|$|E
2500|$|Paul advises Timothy that {{he should}} not drink water only, but should use a little wine for the sake <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach</b> and {{frequent}} infirmities. Some have suggested this advice is particularly in reference to purifying low quality drinking water, while others suggest it was simply intended to help his digestion and general sickliness. Abstentionists generally regard this passage as a positive example of abstention from wine and see Paul's instructions as exceptional and purely for the sake of health, while other interpreters suggest that Timothy was [...] "upright in his aims" [...] but here guilty of an [...] "excess of severity" [...] or that he felt inappropriately bound by a Hellenistic custom that younger men should not drink.|$|E
2500|$|His {{rapid rise}} to fame {{came with a}} price, however. The teenage ace began {{struggling}} with severe emotional and physical problems. He was also beginning to suffer from battle fatigue, and the stress of combat was causing him stomach problems. Granting Wüsthoff command of the squadron inflamed many of his fellow fliers; they felt their youngest member was pushy and over-ambitious. While his first tenure as acting commander was fleeting, from 12 through 20 December 1917, he was appointed Staffelführer permanently on 19 January 1918. He held the post for two months, until 16 March. By February, he had already made his first sojourn to Doctor Lahmann's Dresden sanatorium for treatment <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach</b> and [...] "nervous disorders".|$|E

2500|$|Ryti {{was sentenced}} to 10years imprisonment, during the Finnish perspective. Along with Ryti, seven other high {{officials}} were sentenced to prison, although for shorter terms. The group was convicted using an ex post facto law, which had been instituted for the purpose by the parliament. Although the Finnish constitution prohibited such legislation, the act in question was passed as a constitutional amendment, with a qualified majority in the parliament. Both the court and the parliament faced pressure from the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom during the process. Despite Ryti and his fellow convicts not being treated particularly badly in prison, Ryti's health failed during his sentence. Most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach</b> {{had to be removed}} due to a tumour; [...] in addition, he developed arthritis during his first winter of imprisonment. By 1949, all the other convicts of the war-responsibility trials had been released on parole, while Ryti was hospitalized. He was pardoned by President Juho Kusti Paasikivi that year.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2013, New Jersey {{residents}} Heung Ju Yi and Kyung Hee brought their 3-year-old son, Ethan, to the zoo to visit the popular [...] "Dinosaur Safari" [...] exhibit. After buying their tickets, {{each member of the}} family was given a free souvenir pressed penny as a gift promoting the exhibit. Soon afterward, Ethan swallowed the coin and began choking. His mother, Kyung, said she'd, [...] "thought he'd died." [...] Unsuccessful attempts to retrieve the coin from his throat were followed by rushing the boy to an emergency medical clinic, where X-rays showed it had entered his stomach. The next day, further X-rays revealed that the coin was not passing naturally, and surgery was required to remove it. Two days later, Ethan was put under general anesthesia, and the coin was removed via endoscopy. The surgery revealed that the zinc in the coin had reacted with his stomach acid and begun to dissolve, creating jagged edges that cut the inside <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach.</b> The family, which did not have health insurance, were charged over $50,000 for this. In early 2014, the family pressed charges against the zoo and the Wildlife Conservation Society for unspecified damages. They claimed the zoo endangered their son since the employee who handed them the coins handed Ethan's directly to him and gave no warning about the choking hazards of small coins.|$|E
