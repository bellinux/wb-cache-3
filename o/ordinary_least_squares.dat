25|$|Least-squares {{problems}} {{fall into}} two categories: linear or <b>ordinary</b> <b>least</b> <b>squares</b> and nonlinear least squares, depending {{on whether or not}} the residuals are linear in all unknowns. The linear least-squares problem occurs in statistical regression analysis; it has a closed-form solution. The nonlinear problem is usually solved by iterative refinement; at each iteration the system is approximated by a linear one, and thus the core calculation is similar in both cases.|$|E

25|$|Regression {{analysis}} {{and in particular}} <b>ordinary</b> <b>least</b> <b>squares</b> specifies that a dependent variable depends according to some function upon one or more independent variables, with an additive error term. Various types of statistical inference on the regression assume that the error term is normally distributed.

25|$|In statistics, <b>ordinary</b> <b>least</b> <b>squares</b> (OLS) or linear {{least squares}} {{is a method}} for {{estimating}} the unknown parameters in a linear regression model, {{with the goal of}} minimizing the sum of the squares {{of the differences between the}} observed responses (values of the variable being predicted) in the given dataset and those predicted by a linear function of a set of explanatory variables. Visually this is seen as the sum of the squared vertical distances between each data point in the set and the corresponding point on the regression line – the smaller the differences, the better the model fits the data. The resulting estimator can be expressed by a simple formula, especially in the case of a single regressor on the right-hand side.|$|E
25|$|Brown et al. (1983) {{noted that}} time series studies {{to that point}} had found that for a 10 percent {{increase}} in the minimum wage, there was a decrease in teenage employment of 1–3 percent. However, the studies found wider variation, from 0 to over 3 percent, in their estimates for the effect on teenage unemployment (teenagers without a job and looking for one). In contrast to the simple supply and demand diagram, it was commonly found that teenagers withdrew from the labor force in response to the minimum wage, which produced the possibility of equal reductions in the supply as well as the demand for labor at a higher minimum wage and hence no impact on the unemployment rate. Using a variety of specifications of the employment and unemployment equations (using <b>ordinary</b> <b>least</b> <b>squares</b> vs. generalized least squares regression procedures, and linear vs. logarithmic specifications), they found that a 10 {{percent increase in the}} minimum wage caused a 1 percent decrease in teenage employment, and no change in the teenage unemployment rate.

2500|$|Although serial {{correlation}} {{does not affect}} the consistency of [...] the estimated regression coefficients, it does affect our ability to conduct valid statistical tests. First, the F-statistic to test for overall significance of the regression may be inflated under positive {{serial correlation}} because the mean squared error (MSE) will tend to underestimate the population error variance. Second, positive serial correlation typically causes the <b>ordinary</b> <b>least</b> <b>squares</b> (OLS) standard errors for the regression coefficients to underestimate the true standard errors. As a consequence, if positive serial correlation is present in the regression, standard linear regression analysis will typically lead us to compute artificially small standard errors for the regression coefficient. These small standard errors will cause the estimated t-statistic to be inflated, suggesting significance where perhaps there is none. The inflated t-statistic, may in turn, lead us to incorrectly reject null hypotheses, about population values of the parameters of the regression model more often than we would if the standard errors were correctly estimated.|$|E
