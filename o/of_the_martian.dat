5|$|Baltic German {{astronomer}} Hermann Struve {{used the}} observed {{changes in the}} orbits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> moons to determine the gravitational influence of the planet's oblate shape. In 1895, he used this data to estimate that the equatorial diameter was 1/190 larger than the polar diameter. In 1911, he refined the value to 1/192. This result was confirmed by American meteorologist Edgar W. Woolard in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Special {{effects were}} {{handled by the}} BBC Visual Effects Department, formed by Bernard Wilkie and Jack Kine in 1954. Kine or Wilkie oversaw effects on a production; due {{to the number of}} effects, both worked on Quatermass and the Pit. The team pre-filmed most of their effects for use during the live broadcasts. They also oversaw {{practical}} effects for the Ealing filming and Riverside transmission, and constructed the bodies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> creatures.|$|E
50|$|Haas' {{network of}} camera drones forms {{a sort of}} group mind, similar to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Martians.</b> Non-networked {{computers}} apparently only think about socks.|$|R
25|$|Good {{and evil}} appear {{relative}} in <b>The</b> War <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Worlds, and <b>the</b> defeat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Martians</b> has an entirely material cause: <b>the</b> action <b>of</b> microscopic bacteria. An insane clergyman {{is important in}} the novel, but his attempts to relate the invasion to Armageddon seem examples of his mental derangement. His death, {{as a result of his}} evangelical outbursts and ravings attracting <b>the</b> attention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Martians,</b> appears an indictment of his obsolete religious attitudes; but the narrator twice prays to God, and suggests that bacteria may have been divinely allowed to exist on Earth for a reason such as this.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Martian</b> Chronicles {{follows a}} [...] "future history" [...] structure. The stories, {{complete}} in themselves, {{come together as}} episodes in a larger sequential narrative framework. The overall structure is in three parts, punctuated by two catastrophes: <b>the</b> near-extinction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Martians</b> and <b>the</b> parallel near-extinction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human race.|$|R
5|$|When Captain Scarlet was {{repeated}} by Central Television {{in the latter}} half of the decade, changes were made to the episode's opening sequence to remove dialogue in which the Mysterons allude to surveillance equipment that is being rotated to facilitate inspection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> Exploration Vehicle. Since the imaging device resembles a missile battery (as the Zero X astronauts mistake it for), this re-edited version inadvertently gives an impression of stronger hostility on the part of the Mysterons.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, Dutch {{graduate}} student Cyprianus Annius van den Bosch made {{a determination of}} the mass of Mars based upon the motions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> moons, with an accuracy of 0.2%. This result was confirmed by the Dutch astronomer Willem de Sitter and published posthumously in 1938. Using observations of the near Earth asteroid Eros from 1926 to 1945, German-American astronomer Eugene K. Rabe was able to make an independent estimate the mass of Mars, {{as well as the other}} planets in the inner Solar System, from the planet's gravitational perturbations of the asteroid. His estimated margin of error was 0.05%, but subsequent checks suggested his result was poorly determined compared to other methods.|$|E
5|$|Mariner 9 and Viking allowed better maps of Mars to be {{made using}} the data from these missions, and another major leap forward was the Mars Global Surveyor mission, {{launched}} in 1996 and operated until late 2006, that allowed complete, extremely detailed maps <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> topography, magnetic field and surface minerals to be obtained. These maps are available online; for example, at Google Mars. Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Express continued exploring with new instruments, and supporting lander missions. NASA provides two online tools: Mars Trek, which provides visualizations of the planet using data from 50 years of exploration, and Experience Curiosity, which simulates traveling on Mars in 3-D with Curiosity.|$|E
50|$|David Custer {{was born}} in Flint, Michigan, and lived in Goodrich, Michigan {{for most of his}} {{childhood}} and young adult life. He attended Goodrich High School, home <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Martians,</b> and <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> Michigan's Flint campus, graduating with a degree in Communications in 2001.|$|R
25|$|In the 1980s a joint American-Canadian venture {{produced}} the television series War <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Worlds that ran for two seasons {{and was a}} direct sequel to George Pal's 1953 feature film. Its premise was that <b>the</b> <b>Martians</b> had not died off but were instead stored in suspension by the US government, and that most people had just forgotten the previous invasion; <b>the</b> accidental awakening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Martians</b> results in another war.|$|R
500|$|Billy-Glenn's brother Richie {{discovers that}} the Martians' heads explode {{when they hear}} Slim Whitman's song [...] "Indian Love Call." [...] He and his {{grandmother}} Florence drive around town, using the song to kill <b>the</b> <b>Martians.</b> <b>The</b> military thereafter broadcast the song around the globe, killing most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Martians</b> and their leader and causing the few remaining survivors to try to flee from Earth. Nathalie and Donald's disembodied heads kiss while <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> spaceship they are on explodes when it crashes into the ocean.|$|R
5|$|Mars is {{approximately}} half {{the diameter of}} Earth with a surface area only slightly less than the total area of Earth's dry land. Mars is less dense than Earth, having about 15% of Earth's volume and 11% of Earth's mass, resulting in about 38% of Earth's surface gravity. The red-orange appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> surface is caused by iron(III) oxide, or rust. It can look like butterscotch; other common surface colors include golden, brown, tan, and greenish, depending on the minerals present.|$|E
5|$|Using {{data from}} Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, {{scientists}} have found widespread deposits of chloride minerals. Evidence suggests that the deposits were formed from the evaporation of mineral enriched waters. The research suggests that lakes may have been scattered over large areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> surface. Usually chlorides are the last minerals {{to come out of}} solution. Carbonates, sulfates, and silica should precipitate out ahead of them. Sulfates and silica have been found by the Mars Rovers on the surface. Places with chloride minerals may have once held various life forms. Furthermore, such areas could preserve traces of ancient life.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass {{decides to}} use Roney's optic-encephalogram, {{a device that}} records {{impressions}} from the optical centres of the brain, and see the visions for himself. Roney's assistant, Barbara Judd, is most sensitive; placing the device on her, they record a violent purge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> hive to root out unwanted mutations. Quatermass concludes that in its most primitive phase mankind was visited by this race of Martians. Some apes and primitive pre-humans were taken away and genetically altered to give them abilities such as telepathy, telekinesis and other psychic powers. They were then returned to Earth, and the buried artefact {{is one of the}} ships that had crashed {{at the end of its}} journey. With their home world dying, the aliens had tried to change humanity's ancestors to have minds and abilities similar to their own, but with a bodily form adapted to life on Earth.|$|E
50|$|H.G. Wells' <b>The</b> War <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Worlds is a comic {{adaptation}} of H. G. Wells' <b>The</b> War <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Worlds by Ian Edginton and D'Israeli.

50|$|Edgar Rice Burroughs {{described}} <b>the</b> divisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sol into zodes, xats, and tals; he {{may have}} been the first to make <b>the</b> mistake <b>of</b> describing <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> year as lasting 687 Martian days, but he was far from the last.|$|R
40|$|A linearised study <b>of</b> {{waves in}} <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> Atmosphere reveals much {{similarity}} with those om the Earth. For motion independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> meridional direction approximations {{can be made}} from the exact solution and those can be regarded as a useful guide to the relevance and importance <b>of</b> waves in <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> atmosphere. We shall distinguish between acoustic waves, including Lamb Waves, inertial gravity, baroclinic and Rossby waves. The beta effect and Newornian radiative damping will be included for these longer perturbations...|$|R
25|$|True {{intermediate}} and felsic {{rocks are}} present on Mars, but exposures are uncommon. Both TES and the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) on the Mars Odyssey spacecraft have identified high silica rocks in Syrtis Major {{and near the}} southwestern rim of the crater Antoniadi. The rocks have spectra resembling quartz-rich dacites and granitoids, suggesting {{that at least some}} parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> crust may have a diversity of igneous rocks similar to Earth's. Some geophysical evidence suggests that the bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> crust may actually consist of basaltic andesite or andesite. The andesitic crust is hidden by overlying basaltic lavas that dominate the surface composition but are volumetrically minor.|$|E
25|$|On 4 March 2015, the ISRO {{reported}} that MOM's methane sensors were functioning normally and are studying Mars' albedo, the reflectivity of the planet's surface. The Mars Colour Camera was also returning new images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> surface.|$|E
25|$|For general {{acceptance}} of past {{life in a}} geologic sample, essentially {{most or all of}} these criteria must be met. All seven criteria have not yet been met for any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> samples, but continued investigations are in progress.|$|E
25|$|In , a hieroglyphics-filled chamber {{seems to}} show the hrossa, séroni, and pfifltriggi as <b>the</b> {{original}} races <b>of</b> Mars, that were wiped out by <b>the</b> arrival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> War <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Worlds <b>Martians.</b>|$|R
50|$|Both {{the miners}} and the Pel leaders {{are unhappy with}} <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> Federation occupation, {{especially}} when the Ice Warrior force displays its ruthlessness in shooting down Pels. <b>The</b> sole concern <b>of</b> <b>the</b> force leader, Commander Azaxyr, is to maintain trisilicate production. There is now a realignment in Pel politics: Ortron and Gebek join forces in seeking to rid <b>the</b> planet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Martians.</b> Ettis, however, has become crazed and is killed trying {{to blow up the}} Citadel. The Ice Warriors now impose martial law on the capital, imprisoning the Queen and her courtiers, and even killing Ortron when he tries to flee.|$|R
40|$|Wisdom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Martians</b> <b>of</b> Science {{refers to}} five {{scientists}} whose brilliance contributed to shaping the modern world. John von Neumann {{was a pioneer}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern computer; Theodore von Kármán was the scientist behind the US Air Force; Leo Szilard initiated <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> nuclear weapons; <b>the</b> Nobel laureate Eugene P Wigner was the world's first nuclear engineer; and Edward Teller was <b>the</b> father <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hydrogen bomb. They were {{born and raised in}} Budapest, were forced out of Hungary and then from Germany, they became Americans, and devoted themselves to <b>the</b> defense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States and the Free World. They contributed significant discoveries to fundamental science ranging from <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> materials to <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> symmetry principle in physics, to creating information theory, to game theory. The areas in which we can learn about their wisdom include applications of science to past, present and future real-world needs; defense; education; environment; human nature; humor; politics; religion; weather modification, and others. This book shows <b>the</b> wisdom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Martians</b> by presenting their thoughts and ideas in their own words and placing them into context. Their wisdom is intriguing, witty, provocative and thought provoking. It extended over many aspects of life and culture that impinge on our existence. While we cannot always agree with what they say, they are never boring. <b>The</b> power <b>of</b> their words and their philosophies will inspire the readers to pursue their own dreams...|$|R
25|$|Finally, between {{approximately}} 4.1 and 3.8 {{billion years}} ago, asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant {{changes to the}} surface environment of objects in the Solar System. The low gravity of Mars suggests that these impacts could have ejected much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> atmosphere into deep space.|$|E
25|$|While {{eventually}} disproved, Lowell's vision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> canals, as {{an artifact}} of an ancient civilization making a desperate last effort to survive, significantly influences the development of science fiction – starting with H. G. Wells' influential The War of the Worlds, which made the further logical inference that creatures from a dying planet might seek to invade Earth.|$|E
25|$|Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> {{surface is}} deeply covered by dust {{as fine as}} talcum powder. The global {{predominance}} of dust obscures the underlying bedrock, making spectroscopic identification of primary minerals impossible from orbit over {{many areas of the}} planet. The red/orange appearance of the dust is caused by iron(III) oxide (nanophase Fe2O3) and the iron(III) oxide-hydroxide mineral goethite.|$|E
2500|$|This story tells <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Second Expedition" [...] to Mars. The {{expedition}} {{is a group}} <b>of</b> four men. <b>The</b> astronauts {{arrive to}} find <b>the</b> <b>Martians</b> to be strangely unresponsive to their presence. The one exception to {{this is a group}} of Martians in a building who greet them with a parade. Several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Martians</b> in <b>the</b> building claim to be from Earth or from other planets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solar system, and the captain slowly realizes that <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> gift for telepathy allows others to view <b>the</b> hallucinations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> insane, and that they have been placed in an insane asylum. <b>The</b> <b>Martians</b> they have encountered all believed that their unusual appearance was a projected hallucination. Because the [...] "hallucinations" [...] are so detailed and the captain refuses to admit he is not from Earth, Mr. Xxx, a psychiatrist, declares him incurable and kills him. When the [...] "imaginary" [...] crew does not disappear as well, Mr. Xxx shoots and kills them too. Finally, as the [...] "imaginary" [...] rocket remains in existence, Mr. Xxx concludes that he too must be crazy and shoots himself. <b>The</b> ship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Second Expedition is sold as scrap at a junkyard.|$|R
2500|$|As {{noted by}} Howard Black: [...] "(...) In {{concrete}} details <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> Fighting Machines as depicted by Wells {{have nothing in}} common with tanks or dive bombers, but the tactical and strategic use made of them is strikingly reminiscent of Blitzkrieg as it would be developed by the German armed forces four decades later. <b>The</b> description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Martians</b> advancing inexorably, at lightning speed, towards London; the British Army completely unable to put up an effective resistance; the British government disintegrating and evacuating the capital; <b>the</b> mass <b>of</b> terrified refugees clogging the roads, all were to be precisely enacted in real life at 1940 France.(...)" [...] Ironically this 1898 prediction came far closer to the actual land fighting of World War II than Wells did much later, much closer to the actual war, in the 1934 <b>The</b> Shape <b>of</b> Things to Come.|$|R
40|$|Mineralogical {{constraints}} can {{be placed}} on <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> surface by assuming chemical equilibria among the surface rocks, atmosphere and hypothesized percolating groundwater. A study was made of possible Martian surface mineralogy, as modified by <b>the</b> action <b>of</b> aqueous alteration, using the EQ 3 / 6 computer codes. These codes calculate gas fugacities, aqueous speciation, ionic strength, pH, Eh and concentration and degree of mineral saturation for complex aqueous systems. Thus, these codes are also able to consider mineralogical solid solutions. These codes are able to predict the likely alteration phases which will occur as <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> weathering on <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> surface. Knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stability conditions <b>of</b> these phases will then assist in <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specifications for <b>the</b> sample canister <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed <b>Martian</b> sample return mission. The model and its results are discussed...|$|R
