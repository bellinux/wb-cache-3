5|$|Hard Truths: The Art of Thornton Dial, {{on display}} from February to September 2011, {{includes}} over 70 large-scale artworks {{and is the}} largest assemblage of Thornton Dial's work ever mounted. The exhibition contextualizes Dial as a relevant, contemporary artist rather than a folk artist or outsider artist as many have portrayed him in the past. The pieces <b>on</b> <b>view</b> <b>in</b> Hard Truths cover a range {{of social and political}} themes, many of which address rural life in the south and the treatment of African Americans. After departing Indianapolis, the exhibition is scheduled to travel to New Orleans, Charlotte, North Carolina and Atlanta.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Sacred Spain: Art and Belief in the Spanish World brought {{together}} 71 {{works of art}} {{from a wide variety}} of lenders, including Peru, Mexico, and the Prado in Spain. The exhibit was composed of a rare collection of pieces, many of which had never been <b>on</b> <b>view</b> <b>in</b> the United States. It featured paintings, sculpture, metalwork, and books by artists such as El Greco, Diego Velázquez, and Bartolomé Esteban Murillo. Andy Warhol Enterprises was displayed at the IMA from October, 2010 to January, 2011 and featured more than 150 works of art by Andy Warhol, as well as archival materials. The exhibition was the largest to illustrate Warhol's fascination with money and feature consumerism as a central theme. Visitors were able to view the progression of Warhol's career, from his beginnings as a commercial artist to his multimillion-dollar empire.|$|E

5|$|The {{exhibition}} {{opened on}} July 9, 1962, with Warhol absent. The thirty-two single soup can canvases {{were placed in}} a single line, much like products on shelves, each displayed on narrow individual ledges. The contemporary impact was uneventful, but the historical impact is considered today {{to have been a}} watershed. The gallery audience was unsure what to make of the exhibit. A John Coplans Artforum article, which was in part spurred on by the responding display of dozens of soup cans by a nearby gallery with a display advertising them at three for 60 cents, encouraged people to take a stand on Warhol. Few actually saw the paintings at the Los Angeles exhibit or at Warhol's studio, but word spread in the form of controversy and scandal due to the work's seeming attempt to replicate the appearance of manufactured objects. Extended debate on the merits and ethics of focusing one's efforts on such a mundane commercial inanimate model kept Warhol's work in art world conversations. The pundits could not believe an artist would reduce the art form to the equivalent of a trip to the local grocery store. Talk did not translate into monetary success for Warhol. Dennis Hopper was the first of only a half dozen to pay $100 for a canvas. Blum decided to try to keep the thirty-two canvases as an intact set and bought back the few sales. This pleased Warhol who had conceived of them as a set, and he agreed to sell the set for ten monthly $100 installments to Blum. Warhol had passed the milestone of his first serious art show. While this exhibition was <b>on</b> <b>view</b> <b>in</b> Los Angeles, Martha Jackson canceled another planned December 1962 New York exhibition.|$|E

25|$|The old Gaelic 'Cloch' {{element is}} found with the 1398 record 'Clockmabanstane' and this {{suggests}} that as in the modern Gaelic 'clach', meaning stone, the whole name may mean the 'stone or burial place of Mabon'. With the decline of Gaelic use in this area so close to England, the word 'Loch' has become appended, especially as the Lochmaben and the Loch of Maben are in the locality. The name Clackmannan is another example where the Gaelic word is undeniably linked with a stone, in this case still <b>on</b> <b>view</b> <b>in</b> the town centre.|$|E
25|$|In 1820, he made {{a statue}} of George Washington {{for the state of}} North Carolina.

The statue was later destroyed by fire in 1831. A plaster replica was sent by the king of Italy in 1910, now on view at the North Carolina Museum of History.

25|$|The {{painting}} was likely {{purchased by the}} American collector John Quinn at the Rosenberg sale or shortly afterwards. Two years earlier, on 10 February 1916, John Quinn had acquired Metzinger's Au Vélodrome (At the Cycle-Race Track) (no. 266) and the Racing Cyclist (no. 124). Both paintings had been <b>on</b> <b>view</b> <b>in</b> the Carroll Galleries exhibition: Third Exhibition of Contemporary French Art—with works by Pach, Gleizes, Picasso, de La Fresnaye, Van Gogh, Gauguin, Derain, Duchamp, Duchamp-Villon and Villon.

25|$|The Metropolitan Museum of Art spent $39 {{million to}} acquire art {{for the fiscal}} year ending in June 2012. At the same time, the museum is {{required}} to list in its annual report the total cash proceeds from art sales each year and to itemize any deaccessioned objects valued at more than $50,000 each. It must also sell those pieces at auction and provide advance public notice of a work being sold if it has been <b>on</b> <b>view</b> <b>in</b> the last ten years. These rules were imposed by the New York State Attorney General in 1972.|$|E

His painting Diamond Lake 1969, 108 x 168inches, was acquired from Philip Johnson by the Museum of Modern Art in 1972 and was installed {{in the lobby of}} MoMA for several months. His painting Elijah 1969, 108 x 55inches was later exhibited in Beijing, China in the early 1990s; and it is currently <b>on</b> <b>view</b> <b>in</b> Havana, Cuba.|$|E

25|$|Pinkney L. Near (1927 - 1990) was {{curator of}} the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts for thirty years.
