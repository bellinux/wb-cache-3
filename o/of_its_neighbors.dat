5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, {{one of the largest and}} most populous European states, was little more than a pawn <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>neighbors</b> (the Russian Empire, Prussia and Austria), who interfered in its domestic politics almost at will. In the second half of the 18th century, the Commonwealth was repeatedly partitioned by the neighboring powers and ceased to exist.|$|E
5|$|Popular dishes include lechón, adobo, sinigang, kare-kare, tapa, crispy pata, pancit, lumpia, and halo-halo. Some common local {{ingredients}} used {{in cooking}} are calamansi, coconuts, saba (a kind of short wide plantain), mangoes, ube, milkfish, and fish sauce. Filipino taste buds {{tend to favor}} robust flavors, but the cuisine is not as spicy as those <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>neighbors.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lava {{flows from}} Mauna Kea {{overlapped}} in complex layers with those <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>neighbors</b> during its growth. Most prominently, Mauna Kea is built upon older flows from Kohala to the northwest, and intersects {{the base of}} Mauna Loa to the south. The original eruptive fissures (rift zones) in the flanks of Mauna Kea were buried by its post-shield volcanism. Hilo Ridge, a prominent underwater rift zone structure east of Mauna Kea, was once {{believed to be a}} part of the volcano; however, it is now understood to be a rift zone of Kohala that has been affected by younger Mauna Kea flows.|$|E

5|$|The music {{style in}} Bahrain {{is similar to}} that <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>neighbors.</b> The Khaliji style of music, which is folk music, is popular in the country. The sawt style of music, which {{involves}} a complex form of urban music, performed by an Oud (plucked lute), a violin and mirwas (a drum), is also popular in Bahrain. Ali Bahar {{was one of the most}} famous singers in Bahrain. He performed his music with his Band Al-Ekhwa (The Brothers). Bahrain was also the site of the first recording studio amongst the Persian Gulf states.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth is a brittle metal with a white, silver-pink hue, often {{occurring}} in its native form, with an iridescent oxide tarnish showing many colors from yellow to blue. The spiral, stair-stepped structure of bismuth crystals {{is the result}} of a higher growth rate around the outside edges than on the inside edges. The variations in the thickness of the oxide layer that forms on the surface of the crystal causes different wavelengths of light to interfere upon reflection, thus displaying a rainbow of colors. When burned in oxygen, bismuth burns with a blue flame and its oxide forms yellow fumes. Its toxicity is much lower than that <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>neighbors</b> in the periodic table, such as lead, antimony, and polonium.|$|E
5|$|Yamhad was {{an ancient}} Semitic kingdom {{centered}} on Ḥalab (Aleppo), Syria. The kingdom emerged {{at the end}} of the 19th century BC, and was ruled by the Yamhadite dynasty kings, who counted on both military and diplomacy to expand their realm. From the beginning of its establishment, the kingdom withstood the aggressions <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>neighbors</b> Mari, Qatna and Assyria, and was turned into the most powerful Syrian kingdom of its era through the actions of its king Yarim-Lim I. By the middle of the 18th century BC, most of Syria minus the south came under the authority of Yamhad, either as a direct possession or through vassalage, and for nearly a century and a half, Yamhad dominated northern, northwestern and eastern Syria, and had influence over small kingdoms in Mesopotamia at the borders of Elam. The kingdom was eventually destroyed by the Hittites, then annexed by Mitanni in the 16th centuryBC.|$|E

30|$|We assume each peer {{dynamically}} updates {{the subjective}} trustworthiness {{value of each}} neighbor peer on completion of each transaction with the corresponding neighbor peer. We also assume that each peer periodically calculates the trustworthiness value for each <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>neighbor</b> peer by requesting other neighbor peers to send the subject trustworthiness values. Therefore, each peer holds an up-to-date subjective trustworthiness value and trustworthiness value to each <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>neighbor</b> peers.|$|R
5|$|By {{the late}} 17th century, much of North America had been claimed by European countries. Spain had claimed Florida {{as well as}} modern-day Mexico {{and much of the}} southwestern part of the continent. The {{northern}} and central Atlantic coast was claimed by Britain, and New France comprised much of what is now eastern Canada as well as the central Illinois Country. The French feared that their territory was vulnerable to the expansionist aims <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>neighbors.</b> In 1681, French nobleman Robert Cavelier de La Salle launched an expedition down the Mississippi River from New France, at first believing he would find a path to the Pacific Ocean. Instead, La Salle found a route to the Gulf of Mexico. Although Hernando De Soto had explored and claimed this area for Spain 140years before, on April 9, 1682, La Salle claimed the Mississippi River valley for French king Louis XIV, naming the territory Louisiana in his honor.|$|E
5|$|The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis {{affected}} the economy, {{resulting in a}} lingering decline {{of the value of}} the peso and falls in the stock market. The extent it was affected initially was not as severe as that of some of its Asian neighbors. This was largely due to the fiscal conservatism of the government, partly as a result of decades of monitoring and fiscal supervision from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in comparison to the massive spending <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>neighbors</b> on the rapid acceleration of economic growth. There have been signs of progress since. In 2004, the economy experienced 6.4% GDP growth and 7.1% in 2007, its fastest pace of growth in three decades. Average annual GDP growth per capita for the period 1966–2007 still stands at 1.45% in comparison to an average of 5.96% for the East Asia and the Pacific region as a whole. The daily income for 45% of the population of the Philippines remains less than $2.|$|E

If the vertex were merged with another vertex in step 3, the vertex {{that it was}} merged with will already have been colored, and we assign it the same color. This is valid because we only merged vertices that were not adjacent in the original graph. If we had removed it in step 2 because it had at most 4 adjacent vertices, all <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>neighbors</b> {{at the time of}} its removal will have already been colored, and we can simply assign it a color that none <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>neighbors</b> is using.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the colonial}} period, Honduras' economy was based largely on mining, cattle raising and the export of {{tropical}} hardwoods. Unlike most <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>neighbors,</b> Honduras did not develop a significant coffee industry, and one of the results of this was that much of its export wealth ended up being generated by foreign firms, often creating little local capital. For much of the nineteenth century, Hondurans looked to mining as a means of improving their economic position.|$|E
25|$|The Biblical prophets, {{including}} Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Jeremiah, had {{a concept}} of the divine that differed significantly {{from that of the}} nature religions. According to Jewish mythology, their lives were full of miracles, signs, and visions from God that kept Jewish mythology alive, growing, and distinct from the pagan mythologies <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>neighbors.</b> Instead of seeing the God of Israel as just one national god, these prophets saw him as the one God of the entire universe.|$|E

The bishop marched south and destroyed Biel along with a number of towns in the southern Jura Mountains. During the Gugler war in 1375, there were several battles between Bernese troops and English mercenaries under Enguerrand de Coucy.|$|E

Gujaratis, including Hindus and Muslims as well as the enterprising Parsi class of Zoroastrians, had been specializing in the organisation of overseas trade for many centuries, and had moved into various branches of commerce such as commodity trade, brokerage, money-changing, money-lending and banking.|$|E

It was the state religion of the Kingdom of Khotan until its collapse in 1000. Influenced by Mahayana Buddhism, the kingdom’s vast collection of texts, which included the indigenous Book of Zambasta and a Khotanese translation of the Sanghata Sutra (the earliest translation of the Sanskrit text to date), helped Khotan influence the Buddhist practices <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>neighbors,</b> most notably Tibet.|$|E
