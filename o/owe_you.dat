500|$|Shaw was {{eventually}} won {{over by the}} intervention of Geoff Travis and by Morrissey's praise {{of her in the}} press. In January 1984, NME announced that Shaw and the Smiths would release a collaborative recording of [...] "I Don't <b>Owe</b> <b>You</b> Anything" [...] as a single on Rough Trade. In February, Shaw and the Smiths journeyed to Matrix Studios in London, where Shaw recorded three Smiths songs with Marr, Joyce and Rourke. The version of [...] "Hand in Glove" [...] recorded at Matrix was performed in the key of D minor, while Marr placed the intro riff's accent on a major scale and Shaw altered some lyrics. Shaw ended up selecting their recording of [...] "Hand in Glove" [...] as the single's A-side, placing [...] "I Don't <b>Owe</b> <b>You</b> Anything" [...] as the B-side. The cover features a still of Rita Tushingham from the movie A Taste of Honey, an adaptation of the play of the same name that was written by Shelagh Delaney, who appeared on the covers of the single [...] "Girlfriend In a Coma" [...] and the compilation album Louder Than Bombs.|$|E
500|$|I've {{had this}} idea {{in my head}} for this show Tears of a Clown which is a {{combination}} of music and storytelling.

I chose to debut this work in progress, this rough rehearsal, here in Australia because I feel so bad about cancelling on you guys the last time. I'm sorry. You've been so patient, you waited for so long, I feel like I <b>owe</b> <b>you</b> a present, so this is your present... I want to make a disclaimer...

500|$|Despite having {{established}} {{themselves as}} a group, Morrissey and Marr still harboured ambitions {{that they would be}} recognised as songwriters by having their songs covered by others. Their top choice was singer Sandie Shaw, who had scored several hits throughout the 1960s {{and was one of the}} most prominent British vocalists of her era. In the summer of 1983, Marr and Morrissey began asking Shaw to cover their song [...] "I Don't <b>Owe</b> <b>You</b> Anything", which they had conceived with her in mind to perform. The pair sent Shaw various letters coupled with song demos. Shaw was sceptical at first; she was discouraged by the negative media attention that accompanied the Smiths song [...] "Reel Around the Fountain", and when she received a copy of [...] "Hand in Glove" [...] in the mail, she reportedly exclaimed to her husband [...] "he's started sending me pictures of naked men with their bums showing!" ...|$|E
500|$|After more behind-the-scenes {{contract}} wrangling, Smith {{became a}} St. Louis Cardinal on February 11, 1982. Herzog believed Smith could improve his offensive production by hitting more ground balls, and subsequently created a motivational tool {{designed to help}} Smith concentrate on that task. Approaching Smith one day during spring training, Herzog said, [...] "Every time you hit a fly ball, you owe me a buck. Every time you hit a ground ball, I <b>owe</b> <b>you</b> a buck. We'll keep that going all year." [...] Smith agreed to the wager, {{and by the end}} of the season had won close to $300 from Herzog. As the 1982 season got underway, Herzog's newly assembled team won 12 games in a row during the month of April, and finished the season atop the National League East division. Herzog would later say of Smith's contributions that, [...] "If he saved two runs a game on defense, which he did many a night, it seemed to me that was just as valuable to the team as a player who drove in two runs a game on offense." ...|$|E
500|$|Hartman first {{performed}} his Clinton {{impression on}} {{an episode of}} The Tonight Show. When he met Clinton in 1993 Hartman remarked, [...] "I guess I <b>owe</b> <b>you</b> a few apologies", adding later that he [...] "sometimes [...] a twinge of guilt about [...] ". Clinton showed good humor and sent Hartman a signed photo with the text: [...] "You're not the president, but you play one on TV. And you're OK, mostly." [...] For his Clinton impression, Hartman copied the president's [...] "post-nasal drip" [...] and the [...] "slight scratchiness" [...] in his voice, {{as well as his}} open, [...] "less intimidating" [...] hand gestures. Hartman opted against wearing a larger prosthetic nose when portraying Clinton, as he felt it would be distracting. He instead wore a wig, dyed his eyebrows brighter and used makeup to highlight his nose. One of Hartman's more famous sketches as Clinton saw the president visit a McDonald's restaurant and explain his policies by eating other customers' food. The writers told him that he was not eating enough during rehearsals for the sketch – {{by the end of the}} live performance, Hartman had eaten so much he could barely speak.|$|E

2500|$|For some time, Qifu Mumo's brother Qifu Keshuluo (乞伏軻殊羅) {{had been}} {{having an affair with}} Qifu Chipan's {{concubine}} Consort Tufa. [...] After Qifu Mumo heard rumors, he secured the palace, and Qifu Keshuluo, in fear that the affair had been discovered, plotted with their uncle Qifu Shiyin (乞伏什寅) to assassinate Qifu Mumo, and then to take Juqu Xingguo and flee to Northern Liang. [...] They therefore had Consort Tufa try to steal Qifu Mumo's bedchamber keys, but the wrong keys were stolen, and the plot was exposed. [...] Qifu Mumo executed Qifu Keshuluo's associates but spared Qifu Keshuluo, but also arrested Qifu Shiyin and whipped him. [...] Qifu Shiyin, in anger, stated, [...] "I <b>owe</b> <b>you</b> a life, but do not <b>owe</b> <b>you</b> a whipping." [...] In anger, Qifu Mumo cut Qifu Shiyin's abdomen open and threw his body into a river. [...] In 430, having heard that two other uncles, Qifu Baiyang (乞伏白養) and Qifu Qulie (乞伏去列) were complaining about Qifu Shiyin's death, he executed them as well.|$|E

2500|$|Kierra Valencia [...] "Kiki" [...] Sheard (born June 20, 1987 in Detroit, Michigan) is an American gospel singer, fashion designer, {{and radio}} host. She is the {{daughter}} of gospel singer Karen Clark Sheard (member of gospel singing group The Clark Sisters) and the granddaughter of gospel choral director Mattie Moss Clark. Sheard portrayed Litha in the 2010 Christian-drama film Preacher's Kid. [...] After appearing on her mother's albums, Sheard broke onto the music scene with the release of her debut album I <b>Owe</b> <b>You</b> in 2004. Her hit single [...] "You Don't Know" [...] was written about her mother's bout with an almost fatal blood clot.|$|E
2500|$|Born in Detroit, Michigan, {{and raised}} in the suburb of West Bloomfield, Sheard spent her {{formative}} years surrounded by the influences of her family, their faith, and their music. At age 6, she began singing in the choir at Greater Emmanuel Institutional Church of God in Christ, pastored by her father Bishop J. Drew Sheard. Even at a young age, Sheard had a preternatural grip on the signature [...] "Clark sound" [...] pioneered by her mother and aunts, executing high and fast melismata, riffs, runs, and deep, throaty growls sometimes referred to as [...] "squalls" [...] (the latter is prominently displayed on [...] "Done Did It", a traditional gospel leaning track from her album I <b>Owe</b> <b>You).</b>|$|E

He succeeded when the Butler Act was passed in Tennessee, on March 25, 1925. Butler later stated, [...] "I didn't know {{anything}} about evolution... I'd read in the papers that boys and girls were coming home from school and telling their fathers and mothers that the Bible was all nonsense." [...] Tennessee governor Austin Peay signed the law to gain support among rural legislators, but believed the law would neither be enforced nor interfere with education in Tennessee schools.

2500|$|That {{led to the}} 1977–78 {{motto of}} [...] "We <b>owe</b> <b>you</b> one", which would {{ultimately}} backfire when they lost in the conference finals that season to the Washington Bullets, {{who went on to}} win the NBA championship. In the next four seasons, the 76ers would fall short of the NBA Championship, even after Shue handed the coaching reins to former great Billy Cunningham. In the 1980 NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers, they lost, four games to two. In Game Six, rookie Magic Johnson played center for the Lakers in place of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (who was out because of a sprained ankle sustained in Game Five) and scored 42 points. In the 1981 Eastern Conference Finals, the 76ers opened a 3–1 series lead over the Celtics only to see Boston come back and win the series in seven games. The following season, the 76ers again faced the Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals, and again jumped to a 3–1 series lead only to see Boston forge a 3–3 series tie. The 76ers were given little chance of winning as they faced the Celtics in Game Seven at Boston Garden. This time, they played angry but inspired basketball, pulling away to a 120–106 victory and becoming the 3rd NBA road team to win Game 7 after leading series 3–1. In the game's closing moments, the Boston Garden fans began chanting [...] "Beat L.A., Beat L.A.", as they realized their team would lose the playoff series to a hated opponent (Philadelphia 76ers), nonetheless openly wished that opponent good luck in the next round against a more hated opponent (the Los Angeles Lakers). The team lost the 1982 Finals in six games against the Los Angeles Lakers.|$|E
2500|$|Booth {{was still}} {{scarcely}} {{more than a}} young girl when a friend suggested to her that no complete history {{of the city of}} New York had ever been written, and that it might be well to prepare such a one for the use of schools. Although without ambition to attempt the impossible, yet never daunted by the possible, she at once busied herself in the undertaking, and, after some years spent in preparation, finished one that became, on the request of a publisher, the basis of a more important work upon the same subject, her material having far outgrown the limits proposed, and her experience having taught her the best way of using it. She knew that it was no petty work, as many of the most stirring events of colonial and national history were connected with its story. During the course of her historical work, Booth had full access to libraries and archives. Washington Irving sent her a letter of cordial encouragement, and D. T. Valentine, Henry B. Dawson, W. J. Davis, E. B. O'Callaghan, and numerous others showered her with documents and every assistance. [...] "My Dear Miss Booth," [...] writes Benson G. Lossing, [...] "the citizens of New York <b>owe</b> <b>you</b> a debt of gratitude for this popular story {{of the life of the}} great metropolis, containing so many important facts in its history, and included in one volume accessible to all. I congratulate you on the completeness of the task and the admirable manner in which it has been performed." [...] The history appeared in one large volume, and met at once with a generous welcome, whose pecuniary results were very considerable. So satisfactory, indeed, was its reception, that the publisher proposed to her to go abroad and write popular histories of the great European capitals, London, Paris, Berlin, and Vienna. It was a bright vision for the young writer, but the approach of war and other fortuitous circumstances prevented its becoming a reality.|$|E
