40|$|AbstractNowadays, as {{the oven}} is widely used, a variety <b>of</b> <b>pans</b> <b>of</b> {{different}} shapes occur to meet different demands of different people. While, when using many kinds <b>of</b> <b>pans,</b> what troubles users {{is that the}} food on the corners <b>of</b> the <b>pan</b> is easily overcooked. It is resulted from the uneven distribution of the heat in the corners. Meanwhile, when selecting the pan's shape, the neglect of considering {{the shape of the}} oven may cause the waste of the oven's space. So we are faced with the problem that how to choose the optimal pan's shape based on the users’ demands and the shape of the oven. To solve the problem, we develop a model to help decide the shape <b>of</b> <b>pans</b> to choose. In the modelling process, the main factors we consider are the user's focus and the shape of the oven. When considering the shape <b>of</b> the <b>pans,</b> we do not consider the rare shape for particular use since we develop the model for the use <b>of</b> oven and <b>pans</b> under normal conditions.

The 747 entered service on January22, 1970, on Pan Am's New York–London route; the flight had been planned for the evening of January21, but engine overheating made the original aircraft unusable.

The era of commercial jet transportation, {{led by the}} enormous popularity of the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, had revolutionized long-distance travel. Even before it lost the CX-HLS contract, Boeing was asked by Juan Trippe, president <b>of</b> <b>Pan</b> American World Airways (Pan Am), {{one of their most}} important airline customers, to build a passenger aircraft more than twice the size of the 707. During this time, airport congestion, worsened by increasing numbers of passengers carried on relatively small aircraft, became a problem that Trippe thought could be addressed by a larger new aircraft.|$|E
5|$|After the {{resolution}} of all disputes, sixteen parties received at least one seat in the People's Representative Council, while eight received none. The inconsistency {{in the order of}} parties according to votes received and seats allocated arose due to a special rule created to address uneven population distribution between Java and other islands. This rule stipulates that the Hare quota values for the provinces in Java were on average higher than those for the outer islands. A party require fewer votes to automatically secure a seat outside of Java. For example, the National Awakening Party (PKB) received more votes than the National Mandate Party (PAN) but received nearly the same amount of seats. More than half of PKB seats were received in the party's stronghold of East Java, where the quota value was higher. In contrast, only four <b>of</b> <b>PAN</b> seats were automatically secured.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a largely}} organic and uncalculated impulse, {{many of these}} new bands infused classic heavy metal with the immediacy of pub rock and the {{intensity}} of punk rock, implementing to various degrees the crossover of genres started by Motörhead; in general they shunned ballads, de-emphasised harmonies and produced shorter songs with fast tempos and a very aggressive sound based on riffs and power chords, featuring vocals ranging from high pitched wails to gruff and low growls. Iron Maiden, Angel Witch, Saxon, Holocaust, Tygers <b>of</b> <b>Pan</b> Tang, Girlschool, Tank and More are notable performers of this style, which bands such as Atomkraft, Jaguar, Raven and Venom stretched to produce even more extreme results. Critics consider this new approach to heavy metal the greatest musical accomplishment of the NWOBHM and an important evolutionary step for the genre.|$|E

5|$|Helen {{went away}} for a period in June 1941, during which Parsons, {{encouraged}} {{to do so by}} the sexually permissive attitude of the O.T.O., began a sexual relationship with her 17-year-old sister, Sara. Upon Helen's return, Sara asserted that she was Parsons' new wife, and Parsons himself admitted that he found Sara more sexually attractive than Helen. Conflicted in her feelings, Helen sought comfort in Smith and began a relationship with him that lasted {{for the rest of his}} life; the four remained friends. The two couples, along with a number of other Thelemites (some of whom with their children), moved to 1003 South Orange Grove Avenue, an American Craftsman-style mansion. They all contributed to the rent of $100 a month and lived communally in what replaced Winona Boulevard as the new base of the Agape Lodge, maintaining an allotment and slaughtering their own livestock for meat as well as blood rituals. Parsons decorated his new room with a copy of the Stele of Revealing, a statue <b>of</b> <b>Pan,</b> and his collection of swords and daggers. He converted the garage and laundry room into a chemical laboratory and often held science fiction discussion meetings in the kitchen, and entertained the children with hunts for fairies in the 25-acre garden.|$|E
