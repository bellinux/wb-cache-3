5|$|When Magnum XL-200 <b>opened,</b> <b>it</b> used pads {{similar to}} those still in use on Gemini. Shortly after its debut, however, these up-stop plates were {{replaced}} with more traditional up-stop wheels that keep the train from flying off its rails.|$|E

If you happen to be near enough to look over her shoulder, you will notice that the gold and silver lies loose within it. In an inner sanctuary, carefully secured with a second secret spring, she keeps her coppers, together with a postage-stamp and a draper's receipt, nine months old, for elevenpence three-farthings.|$|R
5|$|When the Whitehall–Fair Haven highway first <b>opened,</b> <b>it</b> did {{not have}} a designation. However, the road was part of the {{proposed}} routing of US4, a route in the new U.S. Highway System. It officially became part of US4 when the system was officially approved in November of that year.|$|E
5|$|Accessibility to Odense {{was greatly}} {{increased}} when the ferry service {{between the two}} main Danish islands, Zealand and Funen, {{was replaced by the}} Great Belt Bridge – opened in 1997 for rail traffic, 1998 for road traffic. When the bridge <b>opened,</b> <b>it</b> was the second longest suspension bridge in the world. Aarhus can be reached by train in 1 hour and 33 minutes while, thanks to the Great Belt Bridge, trains to Copenhagen can take as little as an hour and a quarter.|$|E

5|$|By 1909, {{the bulk}} of the castle was {{considered}} obsolete and the War Office transferred it to the Office of Works, who carried out restoration work and <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> to visitors. It reentered service during the First World War, equipped with two quick-firing guns to protect the harbour, but they did not see service during the conflict. After the war, the castle was restored and leased to the town, who again <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> to visitors. Between 1940 and 1943, during the Second World War, it was rearmed with two 4.7-inch (11.9 cm) quick-firing guns, dating from the First World War and housed in concrete gun houses, to protect merchant convoys and the Philips' shipyard. The castle was manned by members of the British Army; officers lived in a nearby cottage, non-commissioned officers in the castle itself, and other ranks in the 19th century fortifications, and later in temporary Nissen huts.|$|E

From Tejen, another line {{continues}} to Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan. After Ashgabat, the line ends at Türkmenbaşy, Turkmenistan, a port on the Caspian Sea. (After a direct rail link between Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan <b>opened,</b> <b>it</b> became possible for the freight to bypass Uzbekistan, which has poor relations with its neighbors).|$|E

5|$|Heartbreak Hotel, a film {{based on}} a mythical {{incident}} involving the kidnapping of Presley, was released theatrically in 1988.

5|$|In 1932, Fairbanks' two-story school, {{built in}} 1907, {{burned to the}} ground. A new, $150,000 three-story {{concrete}} art deco building was proposed as a replacement, and after heated debate, a $100,000 bond measure was approved in 1933. On January 22, 1934, the new school <b>opened.</b> <b>It</b> had space for about 500 students, but the town's growth required renovation and expansion in 1939 and 1948.|$|E

5|$|On July 4, 1916, the Webb {{house was}} {{opened to the}} public with a 25 cent {{admission}} charge, but the American entry into World War I and the rationing of gasoline took its toll on Nutting's business. Nutting sold the house in 1919 to The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in Connecticut, which <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> to the public as a historic house museum.|$|E
5|$|SheiKra {{was also}} the first Dive Coaster to feature a 90-degree drop. In 2005, only two other Dive Coasters in the world had either an 87- or 87.5-degree drop. When SheiKra first <b>opened,</b> <b>it</b> was the tallest, fastest, and longest Dive Coaster ever built, and was the first Dive Coaster in North America. However, in 2007 when Griffon opened at Busch Gardens Williamsburg, SheiKra lost the height and speed records. When Dive Coaster opened at Chime-Long Paradise in 2008, it took the length record.|$|E

2500|$|The {{notes are}} {{selected}} by opening or closing holes with the fingers. Holes are typically {{covered with the}} pads of the fingers, but some players, particularly when negotiating the larger holes and spacing in low whistles, may employ the [...] "piper's grip". With all the holes closed, the whistle generates its lowest note, the tonic of a major scale. Successively opening holes from the bottom upward produces {{the rest of the}} notes of the scale in sequence: with the lowest hole <b>open</b> <b>it</b> generates the second, with the lowest two holes <b>open,</b> <b>it</b> produces the third and so on. With all six holes <b>open,</b> <b>it</b> produces the seventh.|$|R
