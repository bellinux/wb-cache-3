5|$|As {{construction}} began, Tenrikyo followers {{founded the}} Oyasato Construction Young Men's Association Hinokishin Corps, which volunteered time and labor {{to help build}} the yakata. The corps still continues their work today. By 1956, <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the complex had been built {{at the cost of}} 23billion yen, an enormous expense given the economic depression of the time.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{the chapel}} was {{believed}} to be of Anglo-Saxon origin and to have been buried under the earthworks when they were first constructed. An argument then ensued between the antiquarian William Taylor, who championed the Anglo-Saxon dating for the site, and Harrod, who insisted that the chapel was in fact Norman in origin; the issue was not settled until later in the 20th century, when the Norman date was confirmed. By 1900 the castle was open to the public, overseen by a caretaker who lived in <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the keep, the section of which had been reroofed and turned into an apartment.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Enterprise is {{approaching}} the planet. Picard enters his ready room and finds his belongings {{scattered on the}} floor. He calls in Worf, who cannot explain their displacement. D'Sora arrives at Data's cabin where he is painting. She tells him to continue, but is then annoyed when he does so, causing him some confusion. The ship arrives at the coordinates for the planet but finds nothing there. Then it suddenly appears as the ship's computer warns of a depressurization in the observation lounge. The crew investigate and find all the furniture piled in <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the room.|$|E

5|$|Repairs {{were made}} to the castle between 1610 and 1611 by the captain, Sir George Bampfield, at a cost of £211. A survey in 1623 carried out by Sir Richard Morryson showed the castle to be {{equipped}} with ten iron guns – one culverin, five demi-culverins, two sakers, a minion and a falcon – and garrisoned by its captain, five gunners and three soldiers. It was in a poor condition, and <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the gun platform had been undermined by the sea; Morryson's team estimated the likely costs of repairs to amount to £459.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Abu Bakar State Mosque, {{located along}} Skudai Road, {{is the main}} and the oldest mosque in the state. It was built with a {{combination}} of Victorian, Moorish and Malay architectures. The Johor Bahru Old Chinese temple, located on the Trus Road, hosts the Gods of five Chinese dialects spoken in the city. It was built in 1875 and renovated by the Persekutuan Tiong Hua Johor Bahru (Johor Bahru Tiong Hua Association) in 1994–95 {{with the addition of a}} small L-shaped museum in <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the square premises. The Wong Ah Fook Mansion, the home of the late Wong Ah Fook, was a former historical attraction. It stood for more than 150 years but was demolished illegally by its owner in 2014 to make way for a commercial housing development without informing the state government. Other historical religious buildings include the Arulmigu Sri Rajakaliamman Hindu Temple, Sri Raja Mariamman Hindu Temple, Gurdwara Sahib and Church of the Immaculate Conception.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} {{exhibited a}} contrast of bare nave walls against the paintings {{drawn on the}} metal ceilings leading to the main altar and retablo mayor. The ceiling paintings {{were known to be}} works of Raymundo Francia, as shown by his signature on <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the dome in the 1930s. An acknowledgment on the initiative of the San Tarcisio Martir Maribojoc Catholic Association 'Comité de Obras' could also be seen painted before the crossing. Several paintings by Francia on metal had deteriorated even before the total destruction of the church by earthquake in 2013. The Francia paintings were never touched up nor repainted. The new church dome (or cimborrio) was constructed in June 1889. Ray Francia was again commissioned to do mural works on the cimborrio by painting the Epistles of The Four Apostles, namely the saints John, Matthew, Luke and Mark.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the name is unclear as it was not built until long after the reign of King John, who died in 1216. Its present name first {{appeared}} in a 1915 publication, The Heart of Mendip by Francis Knight, when it was being run as a saddler's shop. The royal part of the name {{may have come from}} {{the fact that there was}} a carved king's head on the building, from a time when The King's Head Inn occupied part of the premises, but whether this represented King John or another king is not known. The head was attached to <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the exterior, but is now inside the building, and a replica placed on the outside.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} several {{proposals}} to reduce congestion on Oxford Street. Horse-drawn vehicles were banned in 1931, and traffic signals were installed in the same year. To alleviate congestion and help traffic flow of buses, most of Oxford Street is designated a bus lane during peak daytime hours, when private vehicles are banned. It is only open to buses, taxis and two-wheeled vehicles between 7:00am and 7:00pm on all days except Sundays. The ban was introduced experimentally in June 1972. It was considered a success, with an estimated increase of £250,000 in retail sales. In 2009, a new diagonal crossing opened at Oxford Circus, allowing pedestrians to cross from <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> Oxford Street to the opposite corner without having to cross the road twice or use the pedestrian underpass. This doubles the pedestrian capacity at the junction.|$|E

25|$|The {{courtyard}} {{contains a}} large freestanding belfry towering over {{the graves of}} both Orthodox and Protestant Christians. A tile work plaque inscribed in Armenian {{can be seen by}} the entrance to the cathedral. Graves are also placed along the exterior wall before the entrance, with inscriptions in Armenian. In <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the courtyard, there is a raised area with a memorial to the 1915 Armenian Genocide in Turkey. Across the courtyard and facing the cathedral, there is a building housing a library and museum. Outside of this building are several carved stones showing scenes from the Bible.|$|E
25|$|While {{this took}} place, in April the new Chief of Air Corps, Maj. Gen. James Fechet, {{appointed}} {{a committee of}} senior officers headed by Brig. Gen. Benjamin D. Foulois to approve a design. In July it rejected the circular layout proposed for the new base and put forth a plan that placed all buildings in <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the property. Just prior to acceptance of the property, Lahm sharply criticized the revision to Fechet and a reconsideration, also on August 16, 1928, approved the original circular design. Clark was then detailed for special duty in Washington D.C. as Lahm's liaison with the Construction Service, Quartermaster Corps, which would build the base.|$|E
