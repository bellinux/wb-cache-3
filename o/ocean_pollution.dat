25|$|However, at {{the start}} of the 20th century local traditions {{conflicted}} with modern whaling practices. In 1911 the conflict turned violent in Same Village, Aomori Prefecture. <b>Ocean</b> <b>pollution</b> from the whaling stations, including large quantities of oil and blood runoff, angered the local fishermen and threatened their own fishing grounds. In protest the fishermen burned a Toyo Hogei facility down. The people of the Same region also did not consume whales and considered them sacred.|$|E
25|$|Pollution {{is often}} classed as point source or nonpoint source {{pollution}}. Point source pollution occurs {{when there is}} a single, identifiable, localized source of the pollution. An example is directly discharging sewage and industrial waste into the <b>ocean.</b> <b>Pollution</b> such as this occurs particularly in developing nations. Nonpoint source pollution occurs when the pollution comes from ill-defined and diffuse sources. These can be difficult to regulate. Agricultural runoff and wind blown debris are prime examples.|$|E

His 2009 book Chill: a reassessment of global warming theory argued that most of the recent documented warming is caused by peaking natural cycles, that there is also a potential for global cooling and that adaptation not mitigation should be a priority. His views received widespread coverage in the media – with front page on the Daily Express, and articles in the online versions of The Mail, The Times and an Al Jazeera video.|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{awareness of}} anthropogenic {{sound in the}} ocean has generated international concern that it is affecting marine mammal behavior and could affect entire marine ecosystems as well. Presently {{there is a lack}} of a coherent policy framework for evaluating the environmental impacts of underwater noise pollution. No international treaties or laws specifically address the transmission of sound in waters under national jurisdiction or on the high seas. This dissertation examines the issue of underwater noise pollution in a global context and considers the extent to which the international legal and environmental community has addressed it. ^ The sharp increase in <b>ocean</b> noise <b>pollution</b> is found to be a recent occurrence (within the last 100 years) resulting from the introduction of the internal combustion engine, sonar, and other technologies. Although a trend in increasing anthropogenic ocean noise is unsubstantiated, the intensity of noise in certain geographic areas is shown to have increased. Case studies are carried out on two such areas of intense acoustic activity, Stellwagen Bank and the Ligurian Sea. The important role of NGOs in raising awareness of underwater noise pollution is demonstrated and the effects of noise are shown to be both environmental and political externalities. Underwater noise is shown to be a transboundary pollutant that mandates an international as opposed to a purely national, or unilateral, approach. The 1982 United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea is identified as the appropriate international legal framework with which to begin to address <b>ocean</b> noise. Air <b>pollution</b> policy, specifically the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution, is adopted as a comparative framework for the evolution of <b>ocean</b> noise <b>pollution</b> policy. ^ Recommendations are made for the development of appropriate policy regarding the use of sound in the ocean including the adoption of an ecosystembased approach to <b>ocean</b> noise <b>pollution</b> that incorporates all sources of underwater sound. Finally, the establishment of marine protected areas and the use of ocean zoning are presented as optimal policy instruments to regulate <b>ocean</b> noise <b>pollution.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Acropora derawanesis is {{uncommon}} {{but found}} {{over a large}} area; central Indo-Pacific. This includes the Micronesia, Philippines, Pohnpei, and Southeast Asia. It is native to Singapore, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia (two regions) Micronesia, Australia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand. There is no population for it, but it is threatened by the decline of coral reefs, water temperatures increasing causing bleaching, coral disease, climate change, fishing, the acidification of <b>oceans,</b> <b>pollution,</b> and invasive species. Unlike other Acropora species, this species is not threatened by the Acanthaster planci as it is too fragile. Some specimens occur within Marine Protected Areas, it listed as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List as the population is decreasing, and is listed under Appendix II of CITES.|$|R
50|$|Acropora echinata is {{uncommon}} but occurs {{over a large}} range; Palau, central Pacific, Southeast Asia, the Indo-Pacific, Australia, the Indian Ocean, the East China Sea, and Japan.

This species has a very low resistance to bleaching by the change in water temperature, with all specimens in Palau being affected, as of 1998. The decline of coral reefs, coral disease, fishing, climate change, acidification of <b>oceans,</b> <b>pollution,</b> and being prey to Acanthaster planci also affect the species.
