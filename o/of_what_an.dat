25|$|The Fédération Internationale Amateur de Cyclisme (FIAC) {{which in}} English stands for International Amateur Cycling Federation, {{which was based}} in Rome, Italy, was the amateur cycling arm of the UCI. It had direct ties to the International Olympic Committee (IOC). It had no {{professional}} division. That was the purview of its professional counterpart based in Luxembourg, the Fédération Internationale de Cyclisme Professionnel (FICP), also operated by the UCI. However, a class of paid amateurs called the Superclass is allowed {{even though it may}} contradict the accepted notions <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>an</b> amateur is. However, members of the Supercross class could not win more than US$200 per event and keep their amateur standing. In any case, with the allowance of professionals in the Olympics this has largely become a moot point. USA Cycling, formerly the United States Cycling Federation (USCF) as it was known at the time, was the American affiliate of FIAC. However, it did not have a BMX division at this time. The NBL worked through the then independent IBMXF. Today after purchasing the NBL USA Cycling the NBL represents BMX in the UCI through USA Cycling.|$|E

Li Dan, fearful {{that he was to}} be next, did not dare to speak of them. When Wei further planned to falsely accuse Li Dan, however, someone else {{informed}} on her, and she was executed. Wu Zetian nevertheless had Li Dan's sons demoted in their princely titles, and when the officials Pei Feigong (裴匪躬) and Fan Yunxian (范雲仙) were accused of secretly meeting Li Dan, she executed Pei and Fan and further, barred officials from meeting Li Dan. There were then accusations that Li Dan was plotting treason, and under Wu Zetian's direction, Lai launched an investigation. Lai arrested Li Dan's servants and tortured them—and the torture was such that many of them were ready to falsely implicate themselves and Li Dan. One of Li Dan's servants, An Jincang, however, proclaimed Li Dan's innocence and cut his own belly open to swear to that fact. When Wu Zetian heard <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>An</b> did, she had doctors attend to An and barely save his life, and then ordered Lai to end the investigation, thus saving Li Dan.|$|E

He recalled their concept for the album in an interview with Billboard, [...] "We wanted really to go with a deep, complex album ... more conducive to the high and lows of great stage-performance". Chuck D also cited in their creative vision the commercial circumstances for hip hop at the time, having quickly transitioned from a singles to an album medium in the music industry during the 1980s. In an interview for Westword, he later said, [...] "We understood the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>an</b> album was, so we set out to make something that not only epitomized the standard of an album, but would {{stand the test of time}} by being diverse with sounds and textures, and also being able to home in on the aspect of peaks and valleys".|$|E

[...] Bergstrom credits the album with heavily influencing bands such as ELO, My Morning Jacket, Fleet Foxes and Grizzly Bear, as well as helping bring about the dream pop phenomenon. Another Rolling Stone critic, James Hunter, commented in 2001 on how All Things Must Pass [...] "helped define the decade it ushered in", in that [...] "the cast, the length, the long hair falling on suede-covered shoulders... foretold the sprawl and sleepy ambition of the Seventies." [...] In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Mac Randall writes that the album is exceptional, but [...] "a tad overrated" [...] by those critics who tend to overlook how its last 30 minutes comprise [...] "a bunch of instrumental blues jams that nobody listens to more than once". Unterberger similarly cites the inclusion of Apple Jam as [...] "a very significant flaw", while recognising that its content [...] "proved to be of immense musical importance", {{with the formation of}} Derek and the Dominos. Writing for Pitchfork Media in 2016, Jayson Green said that Harrison was the only former Beatle who [...] "changed the terms <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>an</b> album could be" [...] since, although All Things Must Pass was not the first rock triple LP, [...] "in the cultural imagination, it is the first triple album, the first one released as a pointed statement." ...|$|E

500|$|Oakley and Weinstein were {{appointed}} executive producers and showrunners {{of the seventh}} and eighth seasons. They were chosen partly {{because they had been}} with the show since the third season and understood many of its dynamics. The showrunner is responsible for overseeing all aspects of the show's production. Each episode takes ten months to produce, so the showrunner must [...] "oversee many different episodes in different stages of production all at the same time", with roles including head writer, making notes on the storyboards and working with the voice actors, animators, editors and composers. Oakley and Weinstein often set two script-rewriting rooms in motion at the same time, delegating leadership in the rooms to writers such as Steve Tompkins and David Cohen. Mirkin, who had suggested that the two take over, remained on the show in an advisory capacity, helping Oakley and Weinstein with technical aspects of the show such as editing and sound mixing. When they took over the series, they wanted many of the episodes to be realistic ones that focused more on the five members of the Simpson family and explored their feelings and emotions towards each other. They wanted to produce Treehouse of Horror episodes, episodes about Sideshow Bob, Itchy & Scratchy and several [...] "format-bending" [...] episodes such as [...] "22 Short Films About Springfield", for which Oakley wrote the Principal Skinner and Superintendent Chalmers scene, the latter being his favorite character. They aimed for [...] "at least two episodes per season that 'pushed the envelope', [...] expanded the definition <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>an</b> episode could be." [...] This was a style they employed for both seasons they produced. Season eight featured several episodes in which focus was given to secondary characters and in which new issues were explored, such as divorce. Their preferred choice of guest stars were those with unique and interesting voices, and several of their guest stars were [...] "old grizzled men with distinctive voices" [...] such as R. Lee Ermey, Donald Sutherland, Kirk Douglas and Lawrence Tierney. Oakley considered season three to be the single greatest comedic season of television ever produced and so attempted to recreate the feel of that season for the two he ran, focusing on stories with real emotions and situations, as well as some [...] episodes. Season three was their basis for Homer: [...] "We liked Homer the way he was {{in the second and third}} seasons. That was what we consciously used as our model. Dimwitted, loving, hyper-enthusiastic, creatively goofy, parody of the American father– drawn with real emotions, though admittedly amplified. This was exemplified in [...] "Mother Simpson", [...] "Lisa the Iconoclast", [...] "Diddly-Dum-Doodly", and a couple others. In some of the less reality-based episodes, i.e. the Beer Baron one– usually Swartzwelder's, we'd treat this stricture with a certain amount of latitude." ...|$|E
