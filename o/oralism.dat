25|$|Much of {{the strongest}} {{objection}} to cochlear implants has come from within the Deaf community, {{some of whom are}} pre-lingually deaf people whose first language is a sign language. For some in the Deaf community, cochlear implants are an affront to their culture, which, as they view it, is a minority threatened by the hearing majority. This is an old problem for the deaf community, going back as far as the 18th century with the argument of manualism vs. <b>oralism.</b> This is consistent with medicalisation and the standardisation of the 'normal' body in the 19th century, when differences between normal and abnormal began to be debated. It is important to consider the sociocultural context, particularly in regards to the Deaf community, which considers itself to possess its own unique language and culture. This accounts for the cochlear implant being seen as an affront to their culture, as many do not believe that deafness is {{something that needs to be}} cured. However, it has also been argued that this does not necessarily have to be the case: the cochlear implant can act as a tool Deaf people can use to access the 'hearing world' without losing their Deaf identity.|$|E
500|$|Up to the 1950s, the {{predominant}} method in deaf education was <b>oralism</b> – acquiring oral language comprehension and production. Linguists {{did not consider}} sign language to be true [...] "language", but rather something inferior. Recognition of the legitimacy of ASL was achieved by William Stokoe, a linguist who arrived at Gallaudet University in 1955 when this was still the dominant assumption. Aided by {{the civil rights movement}} of the 1960s, Stokoe argued for manualism, the use of sign language in deaf education. Stokoe noted that sign language shares the important features that oral languages have as a means of communication, and even devised a transcription system for ASL. In doing so, Stokoe revolutionized both deaf education and linguistics. In the 1960s, ASL was sometimes referred to as [...] "Ameslan", but this term is now considered obsolete.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the trend}} for {{cochlear}} implants in children grows, deaf-community advocates {{have tried to}} counter the [...] "either or" [...] formulation of <b>oralism</b> vs manualism with a [...] "both and" [...] approach; some schools are now successfully integrating cochlear implants with sign language in their educational programs.|$|E

2500|$|Alexander Graham Bell Hall, {{one of the}} residences at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), {{adjacent}} to the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID) building, was {{named in honor of}} Bell and dedicated in 1979 (Bell had spent significant amounts of his personal fortune creating institutions for the deaf). A brass plaque mounted at the entrance noted that Bell was [...] "a brilliant and innovative teacher of the deaf who dedicated a great portion of his life to help deaf children develop the potential for listening, speaking and lipreading. Today, NTID emulates the ideals for which Alexander Graham Bell worked". However those opposed to Bell's sole reliance on <b>oralism,</b> as well as his advocacy in the prevention of deafness via eugenics, protested the use of his name for the institutes's residence. In July 2008, the RIT president and its board of trustees approved the removal of the [...] "Alexander Graham Bell Hall" [...] name, along with its plaque. The RIT action is apparently the only known instance of a removal of Bell's name for ideological reasons; ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Oralism</b> is the {{education}} of deaf students through oral language by using lip reading, speech, and mimicking the mouth shapes and breathing patterns of speech instead of using sign language within the classroom. <b>Oralism</b> came into popular use in the United States around the late 1860s. In 1867, the Clarke School for the Deaf in Northampton, Massachusetts was the first school to start teaching in this manner. <b>Oralism</b> and its contrast, manualism, manifest differently in deaf education and {{are the source of}} controversy for involved communities.|$|E

50|$|Two {{general methods}} of deaf {{education}} are manualism and <b>oralism.</b> Manualism is instruction using sign language, and <b>oralism</b> uses spoken language. Although controversy has existed {{since the early}} eighteenth century about which method is more effective, many deaf-educational facilities attempt to integrate both approaches. The National Association of the Deaf advocates a bilingual approach, to best support deaf students in their education.|$|E
50|$|Some deaf {{schools in}} Germany and England that were contemporaries of the Abbé de l'Épée's Paris School used an oralist {{approach}} emphasising speech and lip reading, {{in contrast to}} his belief in manualism. Their methods were closely guarded secrets, and they saw Épée as a rival. The <b>oralism</b> vs. manualism debate still rages to this day. <b>Oralism</b> is sometimes called the German method, and manualism the French method in reference to those times.|$|E

5000|$|The Tokyo School for the Deaf was {{established}} in 1880. [...] Initially, the school adopted a manual teaching method, despite international trends towards <b>oralism.</b>|$|E
50|$|This {{tradition}} {{continued until}} 1880 when <b>oralism</b> began to replace manualism {{as the dominant}} approach to Deaf education, almost obliterating ASL and Deaf culture in America. <b>Oralism</b> was the main philosophy in Deaf education until 1965 when the linguist William Stokoe argued that ASL {{should be regarded as}} a full language with all of the expressive power of any oral language. Deaf Pride began to shoot higher than it had in a century and Deaf education returned to manualism for the most part.|$|E
50|$|In {{relation}} to the Early 16th Century <b>Oralism</b> in Spain, 19th century oralists viewed oral language as a superior form of communication. Gardiner Green Hubbard, Horace Mann, Samuel Gridley Howe and Alexander Graham Bell were popular supporters of <b>oralism</b> {{and its impact on}} deaf education and services. Until the end of the 19th century, many educators of deaf America were deaf themselves. However, oralists like Alexander Graham Bell began to wield increasing influence. Bell and others believed in deaf assimilation with the mainstream hearing world.|$|E

5000|$|Even though {{students}} {{were not allowed to}} use manual signs within the classroom, many of the deaf students preferred manual signs and used them frequently in their dorm rooms. These early attempts at <b>oralism</b> were commonly criticized because of their starkness. Some deaf children were considered [...] "oral failures" [...] because they could not pick up oral language. Others thought that the techniques of <b>oralism</b> actually limited them on what they were taught because they always had to concentrate on the way the words were formed, not what they meant.|$|E
5000|$|Since the {{beginning}} of formal deaf education {{in the eighteenth century}} in the United States, manualism and <b>oralism</b> have been on opposing sides of a heated debate that continues to this day. [...] <b>Oralism</b> as the systematic education of deaf people began in Spain in the mid-1500s and was the byproduct of socioeconomic motives. The church barred deaf people from holy communion because they could not confess aloud. Deaf people were also prohibited from inheriting their family's wealth; therefore, to preserve the family wealth, deaf heirs in Spain were sent to Pedro Ponce de Leon after hearing that he taught a deaf man to talk in San Salvador Monastery in Oña. <b>Oralism</b> provided members of the privileged classes with deaf children a way to channel their children's education and an opportunity to keep them away from the deaf community. Speaking has been equated with the higher classes and higher intellect, signing with the lower.|$|E

50|$|The Milan Conference was {{organized}} by the Pereire Society, an organization formed by the family of Jacob Rodrigues Pereira of France and financed by their numerous railroad and bank holdings (including Société Générale du Crédit Mobilier). The Pereire Society was {{a strong supporter of}} <b>oralism.</b> They organized the Milan conference with the intent to ban sign language. They secured this outcome by carefully selecting who was invited, inviting the delegates to see the oralist success in a local school, and by encouraging negative reactions to those giving speeches supporting sign language and cheering those supporting <b>oralism.</b>|$|E
50|$|Support for <b>oralism</b> gained {{momentum}} in the late 1860s {{and the use of}} manualism started to decrease. Many in the hearing community were now in favor of the evolutionary perspective, which depicted deaf people who used manual language akin to “lower animals”. Some hearing people viewed speech as what separated humans from animals, which in turn caused manual language to be viewed as unhumanlike. The first schools for <b>oralism</b> opened in the 1860s were called The New York Institution for the Improved Instruction of Deaf Mutes and The Clarke Institution for Deaf-Mutes (now the Clarke Schools for Hearing and Speech).|$|E

50|$|Phonocentrism is {{the belief}} that sounds and speech are {{inherently}} superior to, or more primary than, written language. Those who espouse phonocentric views maintain that spoken language is the primary and most fundamental method of communication whereas writing is merely a derived method of capturing speech. Many also believe that spoken language is inherently richer and more intuitive than written language. These views also impact perceptions of sign languages - especially in the United States. <b>Oralism</b> {{is the belief}} that deaf students should use sounds, speech reading, and primarily English instead of signs in their education. Alexander Graham Bell is a well known proponent for <b>oralism</b> of the deaf - such phonocentristic views are rejected by the Deaf community. Phonocentrisim in the context of deafness is referred to as audism.|$|E
5000|$|Leaders of the manualist movement, {{including}} Edward M. Gallaudet, {{argued against}} {{the teaching of}} <b>oralism</b> because it restricted the ability of deaf students to communicate in what was considered their native language.

50|$|At {{that time}} the {{teaching}} of manual language was restricted because the American Hearing Society saw deaf people who used it as different, as foreigners, or as a group with a separate language that {{was a threat to}} the hearing society.
