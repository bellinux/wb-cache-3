The agent-based Logistics Planning System (LPS) is a project aimed at developing a support system for logistics planners. Agents in the LPS will model the business process, expertise and interactions of the <b>organisational</b> or <b>information</b> entities within the logistics planning process. Together, they will automate logistics plan formation, analysis and information gathering, allowing the logistics planner to spend their time refining the logistics plan rather than creating a logistics plan. The agents are to be developed using the Defence Science and Technology Organisation's (BDI-based) ATTITUDE multi-agent programming language...|$|R

The Learning and Growth Perspective, {{the foundation of the}} BSC, assesses <b>organisational</b> capital, <b>information</b> capital and the skills and capabilities of the Research and Innovation Support Advancement (RISA), a division of the National Research Foundation (NRF). This allows the organisation to gain insight into and understanding of what is effective and which learning and growth systems need changing. The RISA’s balanced scorecard (BSC) does not demonstrate how the Learning and Growth Perspective addresses the organisational strategic objectives. In this study, the researcher wished to identify the critical success factors (CSFs) of the Learning and Growth Perspective of RISA so as to achieve its strategic objectives. A cross-sectional, survey-based research approach was adopted. The questions formulated examined the CSFs in five critical areas of the Learning and Growth Perspective namely, <b>information</b> technology, leadership, <b>organisational</b> culture, human resources management and talent management. Two critical success areas, namely talent management and HRM were identified as having an impact on the Learning and Growth Perspective of RISA.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{design of}} <b>organisational</b> <b>information</b> systems {{is a study}} of the complex. An <b>organisational</b> <b>information</b> system in the Human Activity System sense, is the sum total of all that {{contributes}} to distributing information within an organisation. This includes the human actors participating in the system. Managing information about such a system is a difficult task. Technical support for measuring <b>organisational</b> <b>information</b> systems and comparing different ideas about <b>organisational</b> <b>information</b> systems would thus be useful. A high-level simulation of information systems could be such a technical support. There are a number of issues making such a simulation infeasible today. These mainly arise from the complexity of the simulation model, and in consequence of the data input problem. However, by introducing isomorphism and object templates, it is possible to solve some of these problems. In order to utilise these approaches, a framework for isomorphic simulations need to be developed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Most {{cooperation}} {{support systems}} require {{information about the}} organisational {{context in which they}} are used. This is particularly required when systems are used in a large organisation or for the support of inter-organisational cooperation. Following from this requirement, this paper presents the design and functionality of the <b>organisational</b> <b>information</b> system TOSCA for cooperation support systems. TOSCA is composed of two major components: an <b>organisational</b> <b>information</b> base server, which provides services to applications and an <b>organisational</b> <b>information</b> browser, which provides user access. The paper describes the motivation for an <b>organisational</b> <b>information</b> system, the object oriented data model that is used for the information representation, the architecture of the overall system, and the design of the user interface that presents and provides access to the multimedia information. It concludes with the description of how this system supports a task management system and the role it would play in a CSCW environment. 1...|$|E

40|$|Ever-increasing pace of {{technological}} advancements {{coupled with the}} evolution in organisational procedures and objectives significantly reduces the effectiveness of information systems implemented to fulfil strategic <b>organisational</b> <b>information</b> requirements. Effects of obsolescence are further aggravated by the declining manufacturer support and skill base required for modifying system components to meet evolving user requirements. These factors generally force organisations to replace their legacy information systems or to re-engineer them to effectively fulfil <b>organisational</b> <b>information</b> requirements. However, re-engineering and replacement are both not only costly activities but also have substantial associated risks.

40|$|The {{unauthorised}} disclosure of <b>organisational</b> <b>information</b> through social media {{has become an}} issue.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{problematic}} of development methodologies for <b>organisational</b> <b>information</b> systems and especially with their application to business systems. Historically, information systems development methodologies tend to fail, because either they take the organisational purposefulness for granted, or they do not analyse it thoroughly. This paper‟s position is that the analysis, and the definition or redefinition of the systemic purpose are regarded as the utmost expression of the system‟s purposefulness. This is to be achieved by ensuring the participation of all the stakeholders who affect, or are affected by, a particular business system‟s operations. The nature of participation, defined {{as a process of}} the stakeholders‟ perceptual exchanges, is deemed to be problematic in itself, due to the influence exerted upon it by organisational power, coercion and false consciousness. The paper highlights the philosophical reasons for the failures of information systems development methodologies, and provides a conceptual solution to this problematic as well as a strategy for the development of intrinsically motivated <b>organisational</b> <b>information</b> systems. The intrinsically motivated information systems methodology outlined here (BSPA) is intended to yield <b>organisational</b> <b>information</b> systems that demonstrably improve co-ordination of organisational activities, by enabling the development and maintenance of a single/multifaceted view of purpose throughout organisations...|$|E
