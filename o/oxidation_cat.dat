40|$|Antioxidant {{addition}} can be {{one strategy}} to limit lipid oxidation in emulsions. Research has proven that an important factor regarding the efficacy of antioxidants is their localization in the emulsion; however, other factors such as interactions with other components can also have an impact. Thus, {{the aim was to}} evaluate the impact of emulsifiers (Citrem and Tween 80) and presence of endogenous tocopherols on the efficacies of caffeic acid and caffeates (C 1 –C 20) as antioxidants in emulsions. Lipid oxidation was evaluated during storage and partitioning of caffeic acid and caffeates was estimated by measuring their concentrations in the aqueous phase. Partitioning of caffeic acid and caffeates was influenced by emulsifier type and the presence of endogenous tocopherols. Caffeic acid was the most efficient antioxidant in Citrem and Tween stabilized emulsions in the presence of endogenous tocopherol. In contrast, for Tween stabilized emulsions, caffeic acid acted as a prooxidant and the evaluated caffeates acted as strong antioxidants in the absence of endogenous tocopherol. Thus, when endogenous tocopherol was present lipophilization of caffeic acid did not increase its efficacy as an antioxidant. It is suggested that the differences observed in antioxidant efficiency with different emulsifiers and with and without endogenous tocopherols is due to emulsifier–antioxidant interactions and antioxidant–antioxidant interactions in the emulsions. Practical applications: Food emulsions contain endogenous tocopherols, thus, the impact of endogenous tocopherols on the efficacy of applied antioxidants is of interest to the industry. So far the hypotheses about antioxidant in emulsions are based on simple emulsions systems without the presence of tocopherols. The finding in this study revealed that both emulsifier type and the presence of endogenous tocopherol {{had an impact on the}} efficacy of caffeic acid and caffeates due to emulsifier–antioxidant and antioxidant–antioxidant interactions. This highlights the importance of evaluating the antioxidant in each emulsion system before selecting antioxidants for optimal protection against lipid <b>oxidation.</b> <b>CAT</b> value determined in oil-in-water micro emulsions with caffeic acid and caffeates (100 [*]μM) and with and without endogenous tocopherol and lipid oxidation is initiated with the water soluble radical AAPH.

40|$|Oxidations of indigocarmine (IC) by chloramine-T (CAT) and aqueous {{chlorine}} (HOCl) in acidic buffer media, pH 2 - 6, {{have been}} kinetically studied at 30 degrees C using spectrophotometry. The CAT reaction rate shows a first-order dependence on [IC](o) and an inverse fractional order on [p-toluenesulfonamide]. The effect of [CAT] on {{the rate is}} strongly pH dependent with a variable order of 1 - 2 on [CAT]o in the pH range 6 - 2. The chlorine reaction rate follows first-order in [IC](o) and [HOCl](o) each in the pH range 6 - 2. Addition of halide ions and variation of ionic strength of the medium have no influence on the reaction rate. There is a negative effect of dielectric constant of the solvent. The kinetics of the IC <b>oxidation</b> with <b>CAT</b> at pH 6 and of that with HOCl at pHs 2 - 6 are similar suggesting similarity in their rate determining steps. A two-pathway mechanism for the CAT reaction and a one-pathway mechanism for the HOCl reaction, consistent with the kinetic data, have been proposed. Activation parameters have been calculated using the Arrhenius and frying plots. (C) 1995 John Wiley and Sons, Inc...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges in oxidation research today is the determination ofin vivo oxidative stresses. In this investigation, the spectrofluorometry is used to monitor the kinetics of chloramine-T (<b>CAT)</b> <b>oxidation</b> of L-tryptophan (Trp) in basic solutions. The Trp-CAT reaction progress has been monitored at λmax = 485 nm (after using the excitation wavelength of 360 nm) over the temperature range, 293 - 313 K. The redox reaction follows a first-order dependence of the rate each on [CAT] and [Trp], and an inverse fractional-order on [OH-]. Variations of the ionic strength and the solvent dielectric constant have no effect on the rate. An addition of the reduction product of CAT, p-toluenesulfonamide, to the reaction mixture also has no influence on the rate. Based on the temperature effect, activation parameters are evaluated.

The crayfish (6. 27 g) {{were randomly assigned to}} one of three feeding protocols: continuous feeding throughout 80 day, continuous starvation until 80 day, and continuous starvation throughout 50 day and then feeding for the following 30 days. Juveniles from each protocol were weighed, and sacrificed at day 15, 30, 50 or 80. The lipids, glycogen, reduced glutathione (GSH), soluble protein, lipid peroxidation (TBARS), protein <b>oxidation</b> (PO), catalase (<b>CAT),</b> lipase and proteinase activities, and histology were measured on midgut gland. Starved crayfish had a lower hepatosomatic index, number of molts, specific growth rate, lipids, glycogen, and GSH levels than fed animals at all assay times. The starvation did not affect the soluble protein, TBARS, PO levels and CAT. In starved juveniles the lipase activity decreased as starvation time increased, whereas proteinase activity decreased only at day 80. The histological analysis of the starved animals showed several signs of structural alterations. After 30 days of feeding, the starved-feeding animals exhibited a striking recovery of hepatosomatic index, number of molts, lipids and glycogen, GSH, lipase activity and midgut gland structure...|$|R
40|$|The {{complexity}} of plant antioxidative systems {{gives rise to}} many unresolved questions. One relates to the functional importance of dehydroascorbate reductases (DHARs) in interactions between ascorbate and glutathione. To investigate this issue, we produced {{a complete set of}} loss-of-function mutants for the three annotated Arabidopsis DHARs. The combined loss of DHAR 1 and DHAR 3 expression decreased extractable activity to very low levels but had little effect on phenotype or ascorbate and glutathione pools in standard conditions. An analysis of the subcellular localization of the DHARs in Arabidopsis lines stably transformed with GFP fusion proteins revealed that DHAR 1 and DHAR 2 are cytosolic while DHAR 3 is chloroplastic, with no evidence for peroxisomal or mitochondrial localizations. When the mutations were introduced into an oxidative stress genetic background (cat 2), the dhar 1 dhar 2 combination decreased glutathione <b>oxidation</b> and inhibited <b>cat</b> 2 -triggered induction of the salicylic acid pathway. These effects were reversed in cat 2 dhar 1 dhar 2 dhar 3 complemented with any of the three DHARs. The data suggest that (1) DHAR can be decreased to negligible levels without marked effects on ascorbate pools; (2) the cytosolic isoforms are particularly important in coupling intracellular H 2 O 2 metabolism to glutathione oxidation; (3) DHAR-dependent glutathione oxidation influences redox-driven salicylic acid accumulation...|$|R
40|$|We {{test whether}} the {{dysfunction}} with age of carnitine acetyltransferase (CAT), a key mitochondrial enzyme for fuel utilization, {{is due to}} decreased binding affinity for substrate and whether this substrate, fed to old rats, restores CAT activity. The kinetics of CAT were analyzed by using the brains of young and old rats and of old rats supplemented for 7 weeks with the CAT substrate acetyl-l-carnitine (ALCAR) and/or the mitochondrial antioxidant precursor R-α-lipoic acid (LA). Old rats, compared with young rats, showed a decrease in CAT activity and in CAT-binding affinity for both substrates, ALCAR and CoA. Feeding ALCAR or ALCAR plus LA to old rats significantly restored CAT-binding affinity for ALCAR and CoA, and CAT activity. To explore the underlying mechanism, lipid peroxidation and total iron and copper levels were assayed; all increased in old rats. Feeding old rats LA or LA plus ALCAR inhibited lipid peroxidation but did not decrease iron and copper levels. Ex vivo oxidation of young-rat brain with Fe(II) caused loss of CAT activity and binding affinity. In vitro <b>oxidation</b> of purified <b>CAT</b> with Fe(II) inactivated the enzyme but did not alter binding affinity. However, in vitro treatment of CAT with the lipid peroxidation products malondialdehyde or 4 -hydroxy-nonenal caused a decrease in CAT-binding affinity and activity, thus mimicking age-related change. Preincubation of CAT with ALCAR or CoA prevented malondialdehyde-induced dysfunction. Thus, feeding old rats high levels of key mitochondrial metabolites can ameliorate oxidative damage, enzyme activity, substrate-binding affinity, and mitochondrial dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|Pateira de Fermentelos (PF) is {{a natural}} {{freshwater}} wetland in the central region of Portugal. In the last decade, the introduction of agricultural chemicals, heavy metals, domestic wastes, as well as eutrophication and incorrect utility of resources resulted in an increased water pollution. The present research work was carried out to check the various oxidative stress biomarker responses in European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) gill, kidney and liver due to this complex water pollution. Eels were caged and plunged at five different PF sites (A– E) for 48 h. A reference site (R) was also selected at the river spring where no industrial contamination should be detected. Lipid per- <b>oxidation</b> (LPO), catalase (<b>CAT),</b> glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were the oxidative stress biomarkers studied. In gill, site A exposure induced a significant GST activity increase and site B exposure induced CAT activity increase when compared to R. Site C exposure showed a significant CAT and GPX activity increase. Data concerning site D exposure were not determined due to cage disappearance. Site E exposure displayed a significant CAT and GST activity increase. In kidney, site A exposure induced a significant CAT and GPX decrease {{as well as a}} GST increase. Site B exposure showed a significant decrease in GPX activity and GSH content. However, site C exposure demonstrated a significant increase in CAT and a decrease in GPX. Site E exposure showed a significant decrease in GPX and increase in GST. In liver, site A exposure showed a significant GST activity decrease as well as GSH content increase. Site B exposure showed a significant CAT, GST and LPO decrease. Site C exposure showed only GST activity decrease, while site E exposure induced a significant increase in GPX. These investigation findings provide a rational use of oxidative stress biomarkers in freshwater ecosystem pollution biomonitoring using caged fish, and the first attempt reported in Portugal as a study of this particular watercourse under the previous conditions. The presence of pollutants in the PF water was denunciated even without a clear relation to the main pollution source distance. The organ specificity was evident for each parameter but without a clear pattern...|$|R
40|$|Este estudo analisou a associação entre o polimorfismo genético da superóxido dismutase dependente de manganês (Ala 16 Val MnSOD) e biomarcadores oxidativos e inflamatórios em sujeitos hipercolesterolêmicos e controles. Os níveis de colesterol no grupo controle foram de 104 a 178 mg/dL (2. 694. 61 mmol/L) e hipercolesterolêmicos foram de 250 a 529 mg/dL (6. 4713. 70 mmol/L). Os biomarcadores estudados foram: colesterol-LDL oxidado (ox-LDL), anticorpos anti- LDL oxidado (Anti-ox-LDL), proteína C reativa ultra-sensível (PCR-us), TBARS, proteína carbonil, grupos tióis, glutationa (GSH), vitamina C e E, bem como enzimas antioxidantes [superóxido dismutase (SOD) e {{catalase}} (CAT) ]. Adicionalmente foram avaliados os níveis da albumina modificada na isquemia (IMA), bem como o perfil lipídico. Os resultados mostraram uma associação significante entre hipercolesterolemia e altos níveis de ox-LDL, Anti-ox-LDL, IMA e PCR-us. Esses resultados mostraram uma correlação positiva entre IMA e Anti-ox-LDL, e uma correlação negativa entre HDL e PCR-us associado a hpercolesterolemia. A influência do polimorfismo Ala 16 Val nos biomarcadores oxidativos e inflamatórios mostrou que os níveis de HDL foram mais baixos em hipercolesterolêmicos com o alelo V (VV + AV). A presente investigação destacou uma correlação positiva entre níveis de colesterol total, TBARS, proteína carbonil e grupos tióis. Nos sujeitos hipercolesterolêmicos ocorreu uma redução dos níveis de GSH e da atividade da SOD, provavelmente devido à inativação da enzima causada pela oxidação da proteína. A atividade da CAT foi aumentada provavelmente para compensar parcialmente o estresse oxidativo. Um aumento nos níveis sorológicos da Vitamina E também foi observado em sujeitos hipercolesterolêmicos. Baseado nos resultados encontrados, sugere-se uma correlação significante entre hipercolesterolemia e biomarcadores inflamatórios e de estresse oxidativo. Estudos prévios tem demonstrado a interação entre o genótipo VV e biomarcadores oxidativos como oxi-LDL. Contudo, a redução nos níveis de HDL é relevante em hipercolesterolêmicos VV quando comparados com outros grupos. Funcionalmente, a variante Val MnSOD reduz a eficiência MnSOD aumentando a probabilidade de disfunção endotelial e quando associado a hipercolesterolemia pode contribuir para aumentar o risco de eventos cardiovasculares. This study {{aimed to}} analyze the association between the genetic polymorphism of the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (Ala 16 Val MnSOD) and the oxidative and inflammatory markers in hypercholesterolemic and control individuals. Cholesterol levels {{in the control group}} were 104 to 178 mg/dL (2. 694. 61 mmol/L), while the hypercholesterolemic group presented levels 250 to 529 mg/dL (6. 4713. 70 mmol/L) [...] The following biomarkers were also investigated: cholesterol-LDL oxidized (ox-LDL), antibodies anti-LDL oxidized (Anti-ox-LDL), ultra-sensitive C reactive protein (us-CRP), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), carbonyl protein, thiol groups, glutathione (GSH), Vitamins C and E, as well as the superoxide dismutase antioxidant enzymes (SOD) and catalasis (CAT). Additionally, we evaluated the levels of ischemia-modified albumin (IMA), as well as the lipid profile. IMA levels were higher in the hypercholesterolemic group and a significant association between hypercholesterolemia and ox-LDL, Anti-ox-LDL, IMA and us-CRP was observed. A negative correlation between HDL and us-CRP was observed as well. Ala 16 Val polymorphism influenced the oxidative and inflammatory markers and HDL cholesterol levels were lower in the hypercholesterolemic individuals with the allele V (VV + AV). The present study demonstrated a positive correlation between the total cholesterol levels, TBARS, carbonyl protein and thiol groups. In the hypercholesterolemic individuals there was a reduction in the GSH levels and in the SOD activity, probably due to the enzyme inactivation caused by the protein <b>oxidation.</b> The <b>CAT</b> activity significantly increased probably to partially compensate the oxidative stress. An increase in the Vitamin E serum levels was also observed in the hypercholesterolemic individuals. The group with hypercholesterolemia presented an increase of the oxidative stress, especially for the individuals with a VV genotype to Ala 16 Val MnSOD polymorphism. TBARS levels, carbonyl protein, thiols groups, Vitamin E and the catalasis activity were significantly higher in the hypercholesterolemic individuals with a VV genotype while GSH and SOD were lower in these individuals. Functionally, the Val MnSOD variant reduces the MnSOD efficiency thus increasing the probability of development of endothelial dysfunction and contributing to the increase in the risk of cardiovascular events, especially when associated to hypercholesterolemia states...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the effect of antioxidant protected (AOX) or unprotected fresh or oxidized corn oil on animal performance, oxidative status of tissues, pork quality, shelf-life, and antioxidant activity of skeletal muscle of finishing pigs. The experimental design was a complete randomized block design (CRBD) in a factorial arrangement (2 × 2), with 2 levels of corn oil (fresh or oxidized corn oil) and 2 levels of antioxidant (AOX; with or without AOX). A total of 160 barrows were fed for 56 days one of the following experimental diets: fresh oil, fresh oil + AOX, oxidized oil or oxidized oil + AOX. Animal performance was evaluated and oxidative status of blood, liver and jejunum was determined, including thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), free carbonyl, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) as oxidative indicators, as well as fatty acid composition, vitamin A and vitamin E concentration. After the live phase, a total of 32 barrows were selected for pork quality and shelf life evaluation. Subjective and objective quality traits were assessed. Loin chops were collected for drip loss, proximate analyses as well as sensory attributes at 0, 7 and 14 d of aging, that include juiciness, tenderness, off-flavor and oxidized odor. Also, loin chops and ground Boston Butt were evaluated for discoloration percentage and TBARS after 0, 7, 14 and 21 d in the retail display case. Fatty acid, and vitamin A and vitamin E concentration were determined in backfat and belly fat samples. Finally, diaphragm and loin samples were collected and AOX enzyme activity determinations including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were performed. Barrows fed diets formulated with fresh oil had an increased cumulative ADG (P< 0. 03), ADFI (P< 0. 04) after 56 d and increased final weight (P< 0. 03) when compared to animals fed oxidized oil. An increase (P< 0. 06) in TBARS values, a decrease (P< 0. 03) in GPx enzyme activity and a decrease (P< 0. 01) in Vitamin E concentration were observed in plasma from barrows fed diets formulated with oxidized oil. Also, an increase (P< 0. 04) in free carbonyl was detected in plasma from barrows fed diets formulated with AOX unprotected oil. In regards to pork quality and shelf-life, increased hot carcass weight (P< 0. 01) and carcass yield (P< 0. 01) were observed for pigs fed fresh oil and increased (P< 0. 05) carcass yield was observed for pigs fed AOX protected oil. Increased (P< 0. 03) moisture content was observed in loins from animals fed AOX unprotected oil and increased (P< 0. 04) moisture content and decreased (P< 0. 05) fat content were observed for animals fed oxidized oil. After 14 d of retail display, TBARS values were decreased (P< 0. 001) for loins from animals fed diets containing AOX protected fresh oil, and the decrease (P< 0. 001) continued until after 21 d. In backfat, vitamin A concentration was increased (P< 0. 02) in barrows fed fresh oil, and no oil or AOX effects were found for vitamin E concentration. In belly fat, an increase in vitamin A (P< 0. 05) and vitamin E (P< 0. 03) concentrations were observed for barrows fed AOX protected oil. Finally, SOD activity was increased (P< 0. 04) for diets formulated with AOX. Also, CAT and GPx enzyme activity were increased (P< 0. 01) in diaphragm compared to loin. In conclusion, oxidized oil had a negative impact on animal performance affecting ADG and ADFI resulting in a lighter final weight, also, increasing lipid oxidation and affecting antioxidant systems such as GPx and vitamin E in tissues. Pork quality was not impacted; however, shelf-life was positively affected by AOX protected fresh oil decreasing discoloration and lipid <b>oxidation</b> (TBARS). Finally, <b>CAT</b> and GPx activity were increased in muscles with higher oxidative metabolism, and SOD enzyme activity was increased in animals fed AOX protected oils...|$|R
