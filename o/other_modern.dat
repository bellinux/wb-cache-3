5|$|Since its introduction, the Roosevelt dime {{has been}} struck {{continuously}} in large numbers. The Mint transitioned from striking the coin in silver to base metal in 1965, {{and the design}} remains essentially unaltered from when Sinnock created it.

5|$|The Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC) and the New Zealand Kennel Club (NZCK) {{are some}} of {{national}} kennel associations that register both the Jack Russell terrier and the Parson Russell terrier; however, the size requirements for the Jack Russell terrier under both those standards would classify a dog as a Russell terrier in the United States. In 2009, there were 1073 Jack Russells registered with the ANKC, compared to 18 for the Parson Russell terrier. <b>Other</b> <b>modern</b> breeds are often mistaken for modern Jack Russell terriers, including their cousin the Parson Russell terrier, the Tenterfield terrier, and the Rat Terrier.

5|$|Doom was {{released}} to positive reception regarding the fast-paced gameplay, single-player campaign, visuals and soundtrack whereas criticism was predominantly toward the multiplayer mode.

Following the wide release, the game received scores of 85/100 for PC and PlayStation 4 and 87/100 for the Xbox One on Metacritic. The {{final version of the}} game received very positive reviews from users on Steam. It also received praise from other video game creators, including Cliff Bleszinski and Greg Kasavin, who said that the game answers questions that <b>other</b> <b>modern</b> shooters do not answer.|$|E

Evidence supporting the use of steroids in COPD was published in the late 1950s. Bronchodilators came into use in the 1960s following a promising trial of isoprenaline. Further bronchodilators, such as salbutamol, were developed in the 1970s, and the use of LABAs began in the mid-1990s.|$|R

5|$|He {{contends that}} the {{presentation}} of the Quran and its suras was dictated by Muhammad and that the task of Abu Bakr was to collect the Quran between its two covers and transcribe it into one copy, while Uthman's task was to fix the transcription and unify it to prevent variant readings. He also expresses doubts that Ali, as it is alleged, had made a chronologically arranged collection. Darwaza was very critical of <b>other</b> <b>modern</b> interpreters who used certain verses of the Quran to deduce and support scientific theories. He argues that those people have done harm to Islam by trivializing the sacred character of the Quran.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, {{isolated}} {{communities were}} unable to access produce {{that the majority of}} Britain would such as peppers or aubergines. Artisan Welsh produce was limited or non-existent, farms rarely made their own cheese, and Welsh wine was of poor quality. By the 1990s, historical Welsh foods were going through a revival. Farmers' markets became more popular, Welsh organic vegetables and farm-made cheese started to appear in supermarkets. <b>Other</b> <b>modern</b> Welsh characteristics are more subtle, such as supermarkets offering salty butters and laverbread or butchers labelling beef skirt as 'cawl meat'.|$|E
5|$|Lemoine's work defined many of {{the noted}} traits of this movement.

The definition of points of the triangle such as the Lemoine point was also a staple of the geometry, and <b>other</b> <b>modern</b> triangle geometers such as Brocard and Gaston Tarry wrote about similar points.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{commentators}} of Thucydides, with <b>other</b> <b>modern</b> {{historians and}} writers, take varying stances {{on the issue}} of how much of the speeches of Pericles, as given by this historian, do actually represent Pericles' own words and how much of them is free literary creation or paraphrase by Thucydides. Since Pericles never wrote down or distributed his orations, no historians are able to answer this with certainty; Thucydides recreated three of them from memory and, thereby, it cannot be ascertained that he did not add his own notions and thoughts.|$|E

5|$|Smilodon is an extinct genus of machairodont felid. It {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous prehistoric mammals, and the best known saber-toothed cat. Although {{commonly}} known as the saber-toothed tiger, it was not closely related to the tiger or <b>other</b> <b>modern</b> cats. Smilodon lived in the Americas during the Pleistocene epoch (2.5 mya–10,000 years ago). The genus was named in 1842, based on fossils from Brazil. Three species are recognized today: S.gracilis, S.fatalis and S.populator. The two latter species were probably descended from S.gracilis, which itself probably evolved from Megantereon. The largest collection of Smilodon fossils has been obtained from the Rancho La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, California.|$|E
