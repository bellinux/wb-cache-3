40|$|Joseph Paxton, and his protégés and {{followers}} in {{the domain}} of the public park, lived through the mass communications revolution of the nineteenth century, and played a very active part in it. This presentation examines how Paxton and his followers, as writers, editors, and publishers, were leaders in the dissemination of information on horticulture and landscape design, and in particular of the design and operation of public parks. This presentation examines the ways in which Paxton and his followers used, and contributed to the development of, these new media, particularly in respect of their work in public parks. It considers what, and how, they wrote, edited and published, and what this tells us of their views on parks, and of the parks themselves; and what immediate and listing effects these writings have on public perceptions of parks, and on the design and <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>parks.</b> This presentation examines the ways in which Paxton and his followers used the new communications media, establishing the knowledge base of horticulture and park design in a way which has continuing influence to the present day...|$|E

40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{findings from}} {{a survey of}} 660 randomly selected Michigan residents in winter 2007. The survey examined attitudes of Michigan residents toward eight strategies to resolving situations where current revenues are inadequate to support local services at past levels. The strategies examined fall into two broad categories. The first set (tax increases, state and federal aid) seeks to increase local revenues available to support services at previously existing levels and quality. The second set of strategies focus on reducing the costs of providing services {{with the objective of}} maintaining previous levels at a lower cost. This set includes two subgroups of strategies: those that reduce labor costs (layoff employees, reduce employee compensation) and those that alter existing service delivery arrangements (transfer responsibility for the service to the county, state, or a special district government; consolidate the municipality’s service operations with that of another local government; and contract for services from a for-profit organization, a nonprofit agency, or another local government) to reduce the costs of provising local services. Respondents were asked to indicate {{the extent to which they}} agreed with the use of each strategy to resolve funding shortfalls in five different local public services: (1) maintaining and repairing local streets and roads, (2) <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>parks</b> and recreational programs, (3) fire fighting, (4) trash and garbage collection, and (5) police street patrol...|$|E

40|$|In {{metropolitan}} areas, parking management influences drivers {{search time}} and cost for parking spaces, parking revenue, and traffic congestion. The wide deployment <b>of</b> wireless <b>parking</b> meters with sensing and communications capabilities allows the parking authority {{to monitor the}} state <b>of</b> each <b>parking</b> space in real time and optimize the parking management. In this thesis, we study state-of-the-art parking policies in smart parking systems, and show that the smart parking system needs to be 2 ̆ 2 smarter 2 ̆ 2. Our design goals <b>of</b> the smart <b>parking</b> systems include: (1) simplify the <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> <b>parking</b> systems, (2) improve drivers 2 ̆ 7 satisfaction, (3) increase parking revenue, and (4) alleviate traffic congestion. Through analysis and simulations, we first show that the proposed reservation-based parking policy {{has the potential to}} achieve the above goals. We then model the behavior of both service providers and drivers in smart parking systems, and explore the dynamic pricing scheme to achieve the goals in smart parking system design. Furthermore, we design and implement a prototype <b>of</b> Reservation-based Smart <b>Parking</b> System (RSPS) that allows drivers to effectively find and reserve the vacant parking spaces. With the real time tracking <b>of</b> <b>parking</b> status via various sensing technologies, a smart parking system will dynamically update the parking price according to the physical parking status, and the parking price will affect drivers decision on parking slot selection, therefore, affect the parking status. A smart parking system can be regarded as a full-fledged cyber-physical system (CPS). Through extensive experiment based on real traffic traces and a real-world parking map, the results show that the proposed reservation-based parking policy has the potential to simplify the <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> <b>parking</b> systems, as well as alleviate traffic congestion caused by searching for parking.
