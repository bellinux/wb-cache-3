40|$|AbstractThe goal of {{this paper}} is to use accelerometers as an early {{detection}} of restenosis. Restenosis (re-narrowing of the blood vessel) typically occurs within 3 - 6 months after the implantation of a stent. Finite element modelling of an <b>occluded</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> showed that eddies along with an increase in velocity occur around the occlusion. In this paper a wireless accelerometer device was used to detect an occlusion. A human phantom model was used to mimic the wireless transmission capabilities of the system through human muscle ex-vivo. Fast Fourier transform results from the accelerometer showed that a non-occluded blood vessel had significant peaks > 15 Hz, whereas an <b>occluded</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> had peaks < 15 Hz, which provides a signature template for detecting restenosis. The results of the FEM and human phantom experiments show that an accelerometer sensor is capable of detecting restenosis...|$|E
40|$|The tubular device (10) is {{used for}} microsurgery. It {{effectively}} dilates a thrombosed or <b>occluded</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> (95). It incorporates a balloon (8) which is inflated to enlarge the lumen of the blood vessel. The device has a first central tube which extends some way upstream of the balloon, extends through the balloon and extends a little way downstream. There is a flexible second tube (5) on the upstream end, of larger diameter than the first tube and concentric with it. There is a narrow flexible shaft (6) which drives a miniature pump (1) which draws blood into the first tube. Blood may flow through apertures (93) in the first tube to inflate the balloon.

40|$|Stroke, a brain attack, is {{the third}} {{leading cause of death}} in the Western world. Worldwide, about 5. 5 million people died from stroke in 1999 — {{approximately}} 10 % of all deaths. There are more than 3. 5 million survivors in the United States alone, and the disease remains a major cause of disability. In practice,‘stroke ’ refers to an umbrella of conditions caused by the occlusion or haemorrhage of blood vessels supplying the brain. Most often, blood flow is compromised within the territory of an <b>occluded</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel.</b> Less commonly, stroke results from the absence of blood flow to the entire brain due to cardiac arrest.

40|$|Ischemic strokes {{occur when}} an <b>occluded</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> limits the {{delivery}} of oxygen and nutrients to neurons, and can result in widespread cell death. Although stroke is the third {{leading cause of death}} and a major cause of disability among Canadians, the ability to treat this condition is limited, in part, due to an incomplete understanding of the underlying factors that influence cell death. The hippocampus, a structure intimately involved with learning and memory, is highly vulnerable to ischemic brain injury; however, evidence suggests that the various regions of the hippocampus do not respond homogenously to insult. In addition, previous work has shown that differences in response to injury also exist between male and female brain tissue. As a result, the present study aimed to investigate how various factors, including hippocampal region and sex, may influence variability in response ischemic insult. Acute hippocampal slices prepared from the septal and temporal poles of male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to an ex vivo model of stroke, oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). Cell viability assays, which measured mitochondrial function (2, 3, 5 -triphenlytetrazolium chloride metabolism) and cell membrane integrity (lactate dehydrogenase release), were used to examine post-OGD slice viability. To better understand the role that the primary sex hormones, estrogen and testosterone, play in response to neuronal damage, tissue from rats at post-natal day 26 - 29 (pre-adolescence) was compared to tissue from rats at post-natal day 61 - 64 (post-adolescence). The findings from this study suggest that hippocampal tissue harvested from the septal pole of male, pre-adolescent, rats displayed the greatest sensitivity to ischemic insult...|$|E
40|$|Microvascular lesions are {{a common}} feature in the aging brain and {{clinical}} evidence has correlated microvascular pathology {{with the development of}} neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Traditional animal models that replicate hemorrhagic and ischemic lesions in the brain typically affect large regions in the cortex and do not reproduce the small-scale lesions linked to neurodegeneration that likely stem from injuries to single microvessels. Due in part to this lack of smallscale injury animal models, there remains an incomplete understanding of the cellular and pathophysiological dynamics following small-scale vascular lesions, making progress on therapeutic strategies difficult. We used tightly focused femtosecond laser pulses to injure single penetrating arterioles (PA) (i. e., arterioles that plunge into the brain) in the cortex of live anesthetized rodents and used two-photon excited fluorescence (2 PEF) imaging to quantify blood flow changes and to determine the time course of pathological consequences in the brain after injury. We find that after ischemic occlusion of a PA, nearby pial and penetrating arterioles do not actively compensate for the reduction of blood flow observed near the <b>occluded</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel.</b> We find that capillaries connected downstream to the clotted vessel dilate but other capillaries in the vicinity do not, suggesting that any compensatory signal that results in a physiological response travels vascularly. We ruptured individual PAs to induce microhemorrhages that resulted in extravasation of blood into the parenchyma. We find that tissue compression due to the hematoma does not collapse capillaries and cause acute ischemia. 2 PEF imaging of mice expressing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in a subset of cortical neurons revealed no dendrite degeneration out to seven days after microhemorrhage. However, we did observe an inflammatory response by microglia/macrophages as quickly as 1. 5 -hrs after microhemorrhage which persisted past seven days. Lastly, we looked at spine (i. e., post-synaptic terminals on dendrites) dynamics on GFP fluorescent cortical dendrites and found a higher rate of spine loss and gain after a nearby microhemorrhage out to 14 days. This higher rate of spine turnover may help provide an understanding of the development of symptomatic dysfunction due to consequences in neuronal rewiring after a microhemorrhage. The work presented in this dissertation provides quantification of pathological consequences after both ischemic and hemorrhagic injury to a single blood vessel in the brain. We see that after a small-scale ischemic lesion, surrounding blood vessels do not elicit an active response to compensate for a lack of blood flow in the targeted blood vessel and surrounding tissue. After a hemorrhage to a single blood vessel, we do not observe any neuronal degeneration or death. These hemorrhagic lesions, however, do result in an inflammatory reaction that may lead to subtle changes in neuronal rewiring or seed the development of neurodegenerative diseases. The work presented in this dissertation can help provide new insights for the development of novel stroke therapeutics as well as provide cell specific observations about the development of pathological consequences in both ischemic and hemorrhagic lesions in the brain...|$|E

40|$|Complications {{resulting}} from vascular disease such as atherosclerosis {{are a major}} health concern in the United States. Treatments to remove atherosclerotic plaques from <b>occluded</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> often result in injury causing aberrant vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation leading to restenosis and vessel occlusion, rendering the procedure ineffective.

To aid in vessel discovery, we propose a novel automatic method to segment occluded vasculature from labeling minute pulsatile motion that is otherwise imperceptible with the naked eye. Our segmentation technique extracts subtle tissue motions using a technique adapted from phase-based video magnification, in which we measure motion from periodic changes in local phase information albeit for labeling rather than magnification.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the homozygous tate for a hemoglobinopathy in which deoxygenation distorts red blood cells.

Targeted drug delivery aims to reduce the undesired side effects of drug usage by directing or capturing the active agents near a desired site within the body. This is particularly beneficial in, for instance, cancer chemotherapy, where {{the side effects of}} general (systemic) drug admin-istration can be severe. Herein, a numerical investigation of unsteady magnetic drug tar-geting (MDT) using functionalized magnetic microspheres in partly <b>occluded</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> is presented considering the effects of particle-fluid coupling on the transport and capture of the magnetic particles. An Eulerian–Lagrangian technique is adopted to resolve the hemodynamic flow and the motion of the magnetic particles in the flow using ANSYS FLUENT. An implantable cylindrical permanent magnet insert is used to create the requisite magnetic field. Targeted transport of the magnetic particles in a partly occluded vessel differs distinctly from the same in a regular unblocked vessel. Parametric investi-gation is conducted and the influence of the flow Re, magnetic insert diameter, and its ra-dial and axial position on the “targeting efficiency ” is reported. Analysis shows that there exists an optimum regime of operating parameters for which deposition of the drug-carrying magnetic particles in a predesignated target zone on the partly occluded vessel wall can be maximized.

40|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} {{are still the}} predominant cause of death among the adult population in the Western world. Diseases such as myocardial infarction and stroke are caused by <b>occluded</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels,</b> {{as a result of}} atherosclerosis. Severely occluded vessels are preferably replaced with an autologous mammary artery or saphenous vein through by-pass surgery. Autologous replacement vessels are limited since many patients lack suitable vessels due to previous operations or have <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> that are inadequate for transplantation. Available synthetic vascular conduits function satisfactorily in large vessels. However, in small <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> (< 6 mm), synthetic grafts are prone to thrombosis. Thus, {{there is a need for}} alternative vascular graft material of biological origin. The main aim of this Thesis was to evaluate whether bacterial cellulose (BC) can be used as a biomaterial for engineered <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b> For an implant to be accepted in the host, it has to be biocompatible, i. e., be well integrated into the tissue and display appropriate properties. Biocompatibility studies of BC in hamster showed that the material does not induce inflammation and that both cells and microvessels grow into the BC. Thus, BC is well accepted in the tissue. Then, microporous BC was designed to further enhance biocompatibility. Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) cultured on porous BC migrated further into the material compared to cells grown on conventional BC. However, in contrast to conventional BC, porous BC elicited an inflammatory response characterized by macrophages, lymphocytes and myofibroblasts. Taken together, these results indicate that porous BC is inferior to conventional BC with regards to biocompatibility; nevertheless, microporosity improved cellular migration of SMCs in vitro. Additionally, the presence of the non-neuronal cholinergic system was evaluated in the vascular wall of the saphenous vein and cultured venous and arterial SMCs. Components of the non-neuronal cholinergic system were found in the media of the <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> as well as in cultured SMCs. Its function in these cells remains to be determined.

The goal {{of this research is}} to determine what shear rates are pertinent to an <b>occluding</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel,</b> the rate of thrombus growth relative to wall shear rates, and to develop a predictive model for estimating length of time to thrombus occlusion for a given atherosclerotic lesion. Computational studies of severely stenotic idealized vessels were performed to investigate the wall shear rates that may exist. The study shows that maximum shear rates in severe short stenoses were found to exceed 250, 000 1 /s (9, 500 dynes/cm 2). We utilize an in vitro experiment consisting of blood flow through a collagen coated stenosis to study the rate of thrombus growth. Growth is monitored through light microscopy and a camera. Computational fluid dynamics are used to determine shear rates along the thrombus surface as it grows. We found a strong positive correlation between thrombus growth rates and shear rates up to 6, 000 1 /s after a log-log transformation (r= 0. 85, p< 0. 0001). Growth rates at pathologic shear rates were typically 2 - 4 times greater than for physiologic shear rates below 400 s- 1. To determine whether transport or kinetic binding limits the rate of thrombus growth, a computational model of platelet transport was developed. The model allows for thrombus growth by occluding computational cells. We show that thrombus is transport rate-limited for shear rates below 6, 000 1 /s, while it {{is more likely to be}} kinetic rate-limited for higher shear rates. Predictions of occlusion times based on the model demonstrate that increases in stenosis severity results in decreased time to occlusion. Ph. D.

40|$|Rasa 3 is a GTPase {{activating}} protein of the GAP 1 family which targets R-Ras and Rap 1. Although catalytic inactivation or deletion of Rasa 3 in mice {{leads to}} severe hemorrhages and embryonic lethality, the biological function and cellular location of Rasa 3 underlying these defects remains unknown. Here, {{using a combination}} of loss of function studies in mouse and zebrafish as well as in vitro cell biology approaches, we identify a key role for Rasa 3 in endothelial cells and vascular lumen integrity. Specific ablation of Rasa 3 in the mouse endothelium, but not in megakaryocytes and platelets, lead to embryonic bleeding and death at mid-gestation, recapitulating the phenotype observed in full Rasa 3 knock-out mice. Reduced plexus/sprouts formation and vascular lumenization defects were observed when Rasa 3 was specifically inactivated in mouse endothelial cells at the postnatal or adult stages. Similar results were obtained in zebrafish after decreasing Rasa 3 expression. In vitro, depletion of Rasa 3 in cultured endothelial cells increased β 1 integrin activation and cell adhesion to extracellular matrix components, decreased cell migration and blocked tubulogenesis. During migration, these Rasa 3 -depleted cells exhibited larger and more mature adhesions resulting from a perturbed dynamics of adhesion assembly and disassembly which significantly increased their life time. These defects were due to a hyperactivation of the Rap 1 GTPase and blockade of FAK/Src signaling. Finally, Rasa 3 -depleted cells showed reduced turnover of VE-cadherin-based adhesions resulting in more stable endothelial cell-cell adhesion and decreased endothelial permeability. Altogether, our results indicate that Rasa 3 is a critical regulator of Rap 1 in endothelial cells which controls adhesions properties and vascular lumen integrity; its specific endothelial cell inactivation results in <b>occluded</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels,</b> hemorrhages and early embryonic death in mouse, mimicking thus the Rasa 3 -/- mouse phenotype.

TAE is based on selective infusion of particles in the branch of the hepatic artery supplying the tumor lesions. The goal of TAE is to <b>occlude</b> tumor <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> resulting in ischemia and necrosis. Many reports have shown that TAE can reduce tumor size and hormone output, resulting in palliation of symptoms without the use of cytotoxic drugs, resulting in better tolerability. This review will focus on TAE performance and safety in NEN patients with liver metastases...|$|R
40|$|Reports {{continue}} to appear regarding intravascular treat-ment paradigms that restore <b>blood</b> flow to <b>occluded</b> intra-cranial cerebral <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b> 1 - 4 Flow restoration {{is the only}} therapy proved of benefit, and it is indeed important to mon-itor and share results of therapeutic efforts. Clinical studies, case series, and reviews {{continue to}} be conducted and pub-lishedwith different, or unclearmethods of assessment of flow restoration. This variability in reporting methods of flow-res-toration evaluation render comparison of 1 study with others difficult, if not impossible. The problem of variability in re-porting methods {{can be divided into}} problems with 1) termi-nology anddefinition, 2) convention, and 3) application. Hav-ing contributed to some of the confusion myself, I will comment on the variability in reporting methods in the con-text of these problems, likely raising more questions than an-swering them...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Temporary {{ischaemia}} of one uterine horn of anaesthetized, 9 -day pregnant rats was {{induced by}} <b>occluding</b> the uterine <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> with forceps. The {{effects on the}} embryo of 30, 60 or 120 min of ischaemia was examined with the maternal abdominal temperature maintained at 32, 35 or 37 =deg. Ischaemia caused a reduction in fetal survival at all treatment levels. Higher abdominal temperatures caused a greater reduction in fetal survival, as did longer periods of ischaemia. The incidence of fetal malformation was greater in ischaemic than in control horns although specific treatment effects were not apparent. Fetal weights were reduced in the ischaemic horns, especially at the higher abdominal temperatures. These findings show that abdominal temperature can influence the effects of ischaemia and suggest that the embryo is less resistant to uterine ischaemia than was previously thought...|$|R
40|$|Chitosan {{has been}} widely used as a key {{biomaterial}} {{for the development of}} drug delivery systems intended to be administered via oral and parenteral routes. In particular, chitosan-based microparticles are the most frequently employed delivery system, along with specialized systems such as hydrogels, nanoparticles and thin films. Based on the progress made in chitosan-based drug delivery systems, the usefulness of chitosan has further expanded to anti-cancer chemoembolization, tissue engineering, and stem cell research. For instance, chitosan has been used to develop embolic materials designed to efficiently <b>occlude</b> the <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> by which the oxygen and nutrients are supplied. Indeed, it has been reported to be a promising embolic material. For better anti-cancer effect, embolic materials that can locally release anti-cancer drugs were proposed. In addition, a complex of radioactive materials and chitosan to be locally injected into the liver has been investigated as an efficient therapeutic tool for hepatocellular carcinoma. In line with this, a number of attempts have been explored to use chitosan-based carriers for the delivery of various agents, especially to the site of interest. Thus, in this work, studies where chitosan-based drug delivery systems have successfully been used for local delivery will be presented along with future perspectives...|$|R
