5|$|Models by Julio Ángel Fernández {{suggest that}} the {{scattered}} disc, which is the main source for periodic comets in the Solar System, might also be the primary source for <b>Oort</b> <b>cloud</b> objects. According to the models, {{about half of the}} objects scattered travel outward toward the <b>Oort</b> <b>cloud,</b> whereas a quarter are shifted inward to Jupiter's orbit, and a quarter are ejected on hyperbolic orbits. The scattered disc might still be supplying the <b>Oort</b> <b>cloud</b> with material. A third of the scattered disc's population is likely to end up in the <b>Oort</b> <b>cloud</b> after 2.5billion years.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the galactic}} tide, the main trigger for sending comets {{into the inner}} Solar System {{is thought to be}} {{interaction}} between the Sun's <b>Oort</b> <b>cloud</b> and the gravitational fields of nearby stars or giant molecular clouds. The orbit of the Sun through the plane of the Milky Way sometimes brings it in relatively close proximity to other stellar systems. For example, it is hypothesized that 70thousand years ago, perhaps Scholz's star passed through the outer <b>Oort</b> <b>cloud</b> (although its low mass and high relative velocity limited its effect). During the next 10million years the known star with the greatest possibility of perturbing the <b>Oort</b> <b>cloud</b> is Gliese 710. This process could also scatter <b>Oort</b> <b>cloud</b> objects out of the ecliptic plane, potentially also explaining its spherical distribution.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Physicist Richard A. Muller {{postulated}} that the Sun has a heretofore undetected companion, either a brown dwarf or a red dwarf, in an elliptical orbit within the <b>Oort</b> <b>cloud.</b> This object, known as Nemesis, was hypothesized {{to pass through}} {{a portion of the}} <b>Oort</b> <b>cloud</b> approximately every 26million years, bombarding the inner Solar System with comets. However, to date no evidence of Nemesis or the <b>Oort</b> <b>cloud</b> have been found, and many lines of evidence (such as crater counts), have thrown their existence into doubt. Recent scientific analysis no longer supports the idea that extinctions on Earth happen at regular, repeating intervals. Thus, the Nemesis hypothesis is no longer needed to explain current assumptions.|$|E
5000|$|Based {{upon their}} {{respective}} motions through space, ν Horologii {{had a close}} encounter with the star Alpha Fornacis some 351,200 years ago. The two stars came within [...] of each other; close enough to disrupt their respective (hypothetical) <b>Oort</b> <b>clouds.</b> Potentially, the interaction may have produced asymmetries in the Nu Horologii debris disk, and could cause comet showers that increase the dust content. However, {{it is unlikely that}} the encounter was the cause of the disk itself.|$|R
40|$|Long-period and short-period comets are all {{derived from}} a steady flux of 'new' comets coming {{straight}} from the margin of a sphere whose radius is 50, 000 AU (the <b>Oort's</b> <b>cloud).</b> No empirical evidence requires that the <b>Oort's</b> <b>cloud</b> be older than a few million years, but all satisfactory theories have so far linked its formation to {{the origin of the}} solar system. 'New' comets have a size distribution consistent with the accretion of planetesimals, in contrast with older comets that are consistent with a fragmentation distribution. The H, C, N, O elemental ratios to Si suggest the comets are more primitive than the most primitive meteorites, namely the C I chondrites. Their chemistry is poorly known, but observational data suggest a protosolar ratio of C/O at least as large as 0. 66, and a drastic depletion of hydrogen in the solar nebula. This could for instance imply that the T Tauri phase of the sun happened prior to the condensation of comets. An alternate explanation is possible: the interstellar grains were relatively unprocessed during their contraction in the solar nebula, and their mantles, barely modified, would have followed suit in the accretion of comets...|$|R
40|$|With {{the strong}} Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory/Burst and Transient Source Experiment (CGRO/BATSE) {{evidence}} that most gamma-ray bursts {{do not come}} from galactic neutron stars, models involving the accretion of a comet onto a neutron star (NS) no longer appear to be strong contenders for explaining the majority of bursts. If this is the case, then it is worth asking whether {{the lack of an}} observed galactic gamma-ray burst population provides a useful constraint on the number of comets and comet clouds in the galaxy. Owing to the previously unrecognized structural weakness of cometary nuclei, we find the capture cross sections for comet-NS events to be much higher than previously published estimates, with tidal breakup at distances R(sub b) approx. equals 4 x 10 (exp 10) cm from the NS. As a result, impacts of comets onto field NSs penetrating the <b>Oort</b> <b>Clouds</b> of other stars are found to dominate all other galactic NS-comet capture rates by a factor of 100. This in turn predicts that if comet clouds are common, there should be a significant population of repeater sources with (1) a galactic distribution, (2) space-correlated repetition, and (3) a wide range of peak luminosities and luminosity time histories. If all main sequence stars have <b>Oort</b> <b>Clouds</b> like our own, we predict approximately 4000 such repeater sources in the Milky Way at any time, each repeating on time scales of months to years. Based on estimates of the sensitivity of the CGRO/BATSE instrument and assuming isotropic gamma-ray beaming from such events, we estimate that a population of approximately 20 - 200 of these galactic NS-Oort Cloud gamma-ray repeater sources should be detectable by CGRO. In addition, if giant planet formation is common in the galaxy, we estimate that the accretion of isolated comets injected to the interstellar medium by giant planet formation should produce an additional source of galactic, nonrepeating, events. Comparing these estimates to the 3 - 4 soft gamma-ray repeater sources detected by BATSE, one is forced to conclude that (1) comet impacts on NSs are inefficient at producing gamma rays; or (2) the gamma rays from such events are highly beamed; or (3) the fraction of stars in the galaxy with <b>Oort</b> <b>Clouds</b> like our own is not higher than a few percent...|$|R
5|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of {{the migration of}} the giant planets show {{that the number of}} objects captured in the <b>Oort</b> <b>cloud</b> is reduced if Planet Nine was in its predicted orbit at that time. This reduction of objects captured in the <b>Oort</b> <b>cloud</b> also occurred in simulations with the giant planets on their current orbits.|$|E
5|$|The {{outer limit}} of the <b>Oort</b> <b>cloud</b> defines the cosmographical {{boundary}} of the Solar System {{and the extent of}} the Sun's Hill sphere. The outer <b>Oort</b> <b>cloud</b> is only loosely bound to the Solar System, and thus is easily affected by the gravitational pull both of passing stars and of the Milky Way itself. These forces occasionally dislodge comets from their orbits within the cloud and send them toward the inner Solar System. Based on their orbits, most of the short-period comets may come from the scattered disc, but some may still have originated from the <b>Oort</b> <b>cloud.</b>|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{conjecture}} {{that the}} matter composing the <b>Oort</b> <b>cloud</b> formed {{closer to the}} Sun and was scattered far into space by the gravitational effects of the giant planets early in the Solar System's evolution. Although no confirmed direct observations of the <b>Oort</b> <b>cloud</b> have been made, {{it may be the}} source of all long-period and Halley-type comets entering the inner Solar System, and many of the centaurs and Jupiter-family comets as well.|$|E
40|$|Of the {{low energy}} (30 - 100 MeV/N) Fe-group nuclei of Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) a {{fraction}} of about 20 percent of these are in partially ionized states. The origin of these particles are not known at present. From the considerations of relevant cross-sections, the following two important processes of the phenomena are given: (1) these GCR Fe-group nuclei must have captured the orbital electrons at energies of 1 - 5 MeV/N, while traversing matter; and (2) that these GCR ions of 1 - 5 MeV/N are then reaccelerated to energies of at least 30 - 100 MeV/N, most probably in the heliospheric boundary region. Three possible scenarios of the electron-capture processes are briefly discussed: (1) electron capture in a large molecular cloud; (2) GCR equilibrium spectra in ISM and their equilibrium charge; and (3) electron capture in the <b>Oort's</b> <b>cloud...</b>|$|R
40|$|Empirical data {{related to}} {{questions}} regarding the origin of comets are examined, {{taking into account the}} primitive temperature and its evolution, the cometary C- 12 /C- 13 isotope ratio, the chemistry of comets, and the solar-system related orbits of the comets. The theories of cometary origin considered are related to a condensation of comets from the solar nebula and a later ejection into <b>Oort's</b> <b>cloud,</b> a recent condensation of comets in situ, a capture of interstellar comets, and a reversal of the arrow of time in the traditional evolution of comets. The only hypothesis which seems to survive an evaluation of the theories {{on the basis of the}} existing data is that the comets were condensed some five billion years ago in the vicinity of the giant planets or beyond, at the outer edge of the solar nebula...|$|R
40|$|Comet Halley {{spacecraft}} encounters {{and observations}} in 1985 to 1986 are compared to all c omets, both long and short-period. Halley's orbit is quite {{unusual for a}} short-period (SP) comet, characterized by a very small perihelion distance and a retrograde inclination. The comet is much brighter than most SP comets, and is even relatively bright for a long-period comet. Although Halley's orbit crosses the orbits of seven of the nine planets, it can currently make close approaches to only Venus, Earth, and Mars, planets likely too small to have {{played a major role}} in capturing Halley to a short-period orbit. This, and other evidence, suggests that Halley has been in its current orbit for many returns. A variety of dynamical paths for evolving Halley to its present orbit from either the inner or outer <b>Oort</b> <b>clouds</b> are possible, and thus only probabilistic arguments can be made as to the comet's past physical and dynamical history...|$|R
5|$|Computer models {{suggest that}} {{collisions}} of cometary debris during the formation period play {{a far greater}} role than was previously thought. According to these models, the number of collisions early in the Solar System's history {{was so great that}} most comets were destroyed before they reached the <b>Oort</b> <b>cloud.</b> Therefore, the current cumulative mass of the <b>Oort</b> <b>cloud</b> is far less than was once suspected. The estimated mass of the cloud is {{only a small part of}} the 50–100 Earth masses of ejected material.|$|E

40|$|The radial effects {{due to the}} Galaxy tide on some cometary nuclei of the <b>Oort's</b> <b>Cloud</b> {{are taken}} into account. We model the galactic {{structure}} by only considering the three components which are able to exert the main dynamic effects: the bulge, the disk and the dark halo. First we prove the stability role of the dark matter on a solar-type stellar orbit, either by numerical simulations or from the theoretical point of view. Then we simulate the orbital motions {{of some of the}} cometary nuclei which lie on the galactic plane at different longitude. The aim is to study the perturbations on the Keplerian orbits of these nuclei as soon as the whole galactic potential is switched. By assuming the solar distance from the Galaxy center as a parameter, a drastic reduction of the perihelions appears for some of them when the solar distance decreases. Finally the connection with the development of the Life inside the solar system is considered...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{calculate}} the space motions of 21, 497 stars {{to search for}} close stellar encounters with Vega, ǫ Eridani and Fomalhaut during the past 10 6 yr. We discover that ǫ Eridani experienced three < 2 pc encounters over the past 10 5 yr. Within the uncertainties, ǫ Eridani is having a close encounter with Kapteyn’s star near the present epoch, with a 42. 2 % probability that the closest approach distance is < 1 pc. Vega and Fomalhaut experienced four and six < 2 pc encounters, respectively, over the past 10 6 yr. Each had one encounter with a ∼ 2 % probability that the closest approach distance is less than 0. 5 pc. These encounters will not directly influence the debris disks observed around Vega, ǫ Eridani and Fomalhaut, but they may pass through hypothetical <b>Oort</b> <b>clouds</b> surrounding these stars.

40|$|The {{contribution}} of stellar encounters and interstellar erosion to comet cloud mass injection to the ISM is calculated. It is shown that evaporative mass loss from passing stars and SNe {{results in an}} average Galactic mass injection rate of up to 10 to the - 5 th solar mass/yr if such clouds are frequent around solar-type stars. Cometary erosion by interstellar grains produces an injection rate of 10 to the - 5 th to 10 to the - 4 th solar mass/yr. An injection rate of 2 x 10 to the - 5 th solar mass/yr is calculated. Each of these rates could be increased {{by a factor of}} about 15 if the comet clouds contain a significant amount of smaller debris. It is concluded that the total mass injection rate of material to the ISM by comet clouds is small compared to other ISM mass injection sources. Comet cloud mass loss to the ISM could be responsible for a sizeable fraction of the metal and dust abundances of the ISM if <b>Oort</b> <b>clouds</b> are common...|$|R
5|$|Comets can loosely {{be divided}} into two categories: short-period and long-period—the latter being thought to {{originate}} in the <b>Oort</b> <b>cloud.</b> The two major categories of short-period comets are Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) and Halley-type comets. Halley-type comets, which are named after their prototype, Halley's Comet, are thought to have originated in the <b>Oort</b> <b>cloud</b> but to have been drawn into the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets, whereas the JFCs are thought to have originated in the scattered disc. The centaurs are thought to be a dynamically intermediate stage between the scattered disc and the Jupiter family.|$|E
5|$|Ethan Siegel, who {{is deeply}} {{skeptical of the}} {{existence}} of an undiscovered new planet in the Solar System, nevertheless speculates that at least one super-Earth, which have been commonly discovered in other planetary systems but have not been discovered in the Solar System, might have been ejected from the Solar System during a dynamical instability in the early Solar System. Hal Levison thinks that the chance of an ejected object ending up in the inner <b>Oort</b> <b>cloud</b> is only about 2%, and speculates that many objects must have been thrown past the <b>Oort</b> <b>cloud</b> if one has entered a stable orbit.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational {{interaction}} with nearby stars and galactic tides modified cometary orbits {{to make them}} more circular.

Recent {{studies have shown that the}} formation of the <b>Oort</b> <b>cloud</b> is broadly compatible with the hypothesis that the Solar System formed as part of an embedded cluster of 200–400 stars. These early stars likely played a role in the cloud's formation, since the number of close stellar passages within the cluster was much higher than today, leading to far more frequent perturbations.|$|E

40|$|Mounting {{discoveries of}} extrasolar planets {{orbiting}} post-main sequence stars motivate studies aimed at understanding {{the fate of}} these planets. In the traditional "adiabatic" approximation, a secondary's eccentricity remains constant during stellar mass loss. Here, we remove this approximation, investigate the full two-body point-mass problem with isotropic mass loss, and illustrate the resulting dynamical evolution. The magnitude and duration of a star's mass loss combined with a secondary's initial orbital characteristics might provoke ejection, modest eccentricity pumping, or even circularisation of the orbit. We conclude that <b>Oort</b> <b>clouds</b> and wide-separation planets may be dynamically ejected from 1 - 7 Solar-mass parent stars during AGB evolution. The vast majority of planetary material which survives a supernova from a 7 - 20 Solar-mass progenitor will be dynamically ejected from the system, placing limits {{on the existence of}} first-generation pulsar planets. Planets around > 20 Solar-mass black hole progenitors may easily survive or readily be ejected depending on the core collapse and superwind models applied. Material ejected during stellar evolution might contribute significantly to the free-floating planetary population. Comment: 23 pages, 16 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
40|$|Our {{improving}} {{understanding of}} the life cycle of planetary systems prompts investigations {{of the role of the}} Galactic environment before, during and after Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stellar evolution. Here, we investigate the interplay between stellar mass loss, Galactic tidal perturbations, and stellar flybys for evolving stars which host one planet, smaller body or stellar binary companion and reside in the Milky Way's bulge or disc. We find that the potential evolutionary pathways from a main sequence (MS) to a white dwarf (WD) planetary system are a strong function of Galactocentric distance only with respect to the prevalence of stellar flybys. Planetary ejection and collision with the parent star should be more common towards the bulge. At a given location anywhere in the Galaxy, if the mass loss is adiabatic, then the secondary is likely to avoid close flybys during AGB evolution, and cannot eventually escape the resulting WD because of Galactic tides alone. Partly because AGB mass loss will shrink a planetary system's Hill ellipsoid axes by about 20 to 40 per cent, <b>Oort</b> <b>clouds</b> orbiting WDs are likely to be more depleted and dynamically excited than on the MS.

40|$|An {{explanation}} is {{proposed for the}} observed and often discussed clustering of long-period comet aphelia on the sky. Poisson and several multinomial distributions are applied to the most conspicuous cluster, considering only the 80 “new” and 59 “intermediate” comets with the best-determined orbits. The observed number of aphelion points in adjacent areas in two tests with 24 and 36 equal sky areas, respectively, shows a large deviation from a random distribution. The expected probability frequency {{for this to happen}} by chance is < 0. 1 % for the “new” comets alone; it is further reduced when “new” and “intermediate” comets are combined. When these comets are analyzed separately from others, it is found that the clustering is the result of perturbations of their original orbits by the passage of a star, or a stellar system, through <b>Oort's</b> <b>cloud</b> a few million years ago. Because the statistical effect on the change of a comet's angular momentum about the sun is proportional to the square of the ratio of the mass to the velocity of a star relative to the sun, it is a priori probable that passages by a few stars should produce clustering of the aphelia, as is discussed in detail...|$|R

5|$|The <b>Oort</b> <b>cloud</b> is a {{hypothetical}} spherical cloud {{of up to}} a trillion icy objects that {{is thought to be}} the source for all long-period comets and to surround the Solar System at roughly 50,000AU (around 1light-year (ly)), and possibly to as far as 100,000AU (1.87ly). It is thought to be composed of comets that were ejected from the inner Solar System by gravitational interactions with the outer planets. <b>Oort</b> <b>cloud</b> objects move very slowly, and can be perturbed by infrequent events, such as collisions, the gravitational effects of a passing star, or the galactic tide, the tidal force exerted by the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Oort</b> <b>cloud</b> {{is thought}} to be a remnant of the {{original}} protoplanetary disc that formed around the Sun approximately 4.6billion years ago. The most widely accepted hypothesis is that the Oort cloud's objects initially coalesced much closer to the Sun as part of the same process that formed the planets and minor planets, but that gravitational interaction with young gas giants such as Jupiter ejected the objects into extremely long elliptic or parabolic orbits. Recent research has been cited by NASA hypothesizing {{that a large number of}} <b>Oort</b> <b>cloud</b> objects are the product of an exchange of materials between the Sun and its sibling stars as they formed and drifted apart, and it is suggested that many—possibly the majority of—Oort cloud objects did not form in close proximity to the Sun.
