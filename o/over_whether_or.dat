5|$|Apart from {{arguments}} <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not austerity, {{rather than}} increased or frozen spending, is a macroeconomic solution, union leaders have {{also argued that}} the working population is being unjustly {{held responsible for the}} economic mismanagement errors of economists, investors, and bankers. Over 23 million EU workers have become unemployed {{as a consequence of the}} global economic crisis of 2007–2010, and this has led many to call for additional regulation of the banking sector across not only Europe, but the entire world.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{leadership}} was divided <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not to defend pro-Nazi {{speech in the}} United States; pro-labor elements within the ACLU were hostile towards Nazism and fascism, and objected when the ACLU defended Nazis. Several states passed laws outlawing the hate speech directed at ethnic groups. The first person arrested under New Jersey's 1935 hate speech law was a Jehovah's Witness who was charged with disseminating anti-Catholic literature. The ACLU defended the Jehovah's Witnesses, and the charges were dropped. The ACLU proceeded to defend numerous pro-Nazi groups, defending their rights to free speech and free association.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{begins with}} general surgeon Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) {{performing}} a special surgery, {{and to her}} dismay, the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) is absent from the operating room. At Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s house, Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) is engaging in sexual activity with Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), while his wife, Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) is estranged. In the next room, Meredith begins arguing with her husband, Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not he should report the chief of surgery, Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.)'s alcoholism to Larry Jennings (Mitch Pileggi), the hospital's president.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that the}} crew of the train had not been advised that there was a raised fire risk at the time. WCRC was found not to have co-operated fully with the investigation. The ADC found that WCRC's Safety Management System was deficient due to confusion <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not {{the crew of the}} train had been informed of the increased fire risk. WCRC failed to inform Network Rail of its plans to try to prevent future incidents of a similar nature. The ADC found that this was in breach of WCRC's Safety Management System. WCRC chairman David Smith instructed his staff that no further correspondence would be gone into over the matter. The ADC found that this instruction was prejudicial to the safe operation of WCRC's Safety Management System. The instruction was later rescinded. WCRC was also found to be in breach of its Track Access Contract.|$|E
5|$|In 1108, Ranulf {{was dragged}} {{into the middle of}} the ongoing dispute between Archbishop Anselm and the newly {{appointed}} Archbishop of York, Thomas <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not Thomas should profess obedience to Anselm. Because Anselm refused to consecrate Thomas without a profession, and Thomas refused to profess, Thomas was unable to consecrate bishops himself. Ranulf wrote to Anselm, asking that he might act as Thomas' surrogate and consecrate Thurgot as Bishop of St Andrew's. In September 1108, Anselm wrote to Ranulf forbidding anyone but Thomas or Anselm himself to consecrate Thurgot or any other bishops. Later, Ranulf tried to bribe King Henry to take Thomas' side. Thurgot had been prior of the cathedral chapter at Durham, but had disagreed with Ranulf, who arranged for him to be elected to St Andrew's as a solution to the quarrel.|$|E

5|$|In 2001 {{plans were}} {{announced}} {{for a film}} adaptation of the series. Miramax Films was named as purchasing the film rights, with Lawrence Guterman signed to direct. In 2003 Colfer stated that a screenplay had been finalized and that casting was due to start the same year, but expressed scepticism <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not this would come to pass. The film remained in development and {{was assumed to be}} in development hell until 2011, when it was reported that Jim Sheridan was interested in directing the movie. In July 2013, it was announced that Disney and Harvey Weinstein are developing a project based on the first and second installment of the Artemis Fowl series. Robert De Niro and Jane Rosenthal will be the executive producers.|$|E
5|$|The creators' {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Monica was comedian Janeane Garofalo. Cox had {{originally}} been offered the role of Rachel but declined in favor of playing the character's best friend Monica because she was drawn to her strong personality. Meanwhile, the role of Rachel went to actress Jennifer Aniston, Cox's co-star to whom the role of Monica had originally been offered. Before Friends aired, Monica's characterization was greatly debated among writers in regards to the character sleeping with a man on their first date during the pilot. Kauffman in particular greatly defended Monica, arguing with NBC executive Don Ohlmeyer <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not this would make the character too promiscuous. Ultimately, the episode aired unchanged after the studio surveyed the audience, the results of which returned in favor of Monica's existing storyline. The character's struggles with childhood obesity, challenges with romantic relationships and complicated relationship with her mother would eventually become popular staples of the show.|$|E
