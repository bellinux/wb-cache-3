5|$|Its {{population}} in Canada is limited due to both snow depth {{and the presence}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Canadian</b> lynx. The bobcat does not tolerate deep snow, and waits out heavy storms in sheltered areas; it lacks the large, padded feet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Canadian</b> lynx and cannot support its weight on snow as efficiently. The bobcat is not entirely at a disadvantage where its range meets that of the larger felid: displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Canadian</b> lynx by the aggressive bobcat has been observed where they interact in Nova Scotia, while the clearing of coniferous forests for agriculture {{has led to a}} northward retreat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Canadian</b> lynx's range to the advantage of the bobcat. In northern and central Mexico, the cat is found in dry scrubland and forests of pine and oak; its range ends at the tropical southern portion of the country.|$|E
