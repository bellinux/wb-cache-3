5|$|The Welsh slate {{industry}} {{was essentially a}} Welsh-speaking industry. Most of the workforce in the main slate-producing areas of North Wales were drawn from the local area, with little immigration from outside Wales. The industry had a considerable influence on {{the culture of the}} area and on that of Wales as a whole. The caban, the cabin where the quarrymen gathered for their lunch break, was often the scene of wide-ranging discussions, which were often formally minuted. A surviving set of minutes from a caban at the Llechwedd mine at Blaenau Ffestiniog for 1908–10 records discussions on Church Disestablishment, tariff reform and other political topics. Eisteddfodau were held, poetry composed and discussed and most of the larger quarries had their own band, with the Oakley band particularly famous. Burn calculates that there are around fifty men judged worthy of an entry in the Dictionary of Welsh Biography who started their working lives as slate quarrymen, compared to only four owners, though <b>obviously</b> <b>there</b> was also a distinct disparity in the numbers of the two groups.|$|E
25|$|Roads are, {{by their}} nature, used by {{vehicles}} {{and it is}} clearly foreseeable that a person left lying on the road is {{at risk of being}} further injured by an inattentive driver. Hence, if A leaves B on the road with knowledge of that risk and a foreseeable event occurs, A remains the more proximate cause. This leaves whether the test of foresight should be subjective, objective or hybrid (i.e. both subjective and objective). <b>Obviously,</b> <b>there</b> is no difficulty in holding A liable if A had actual knowledge of the likelihood that B would be further injured by a driver. The fault which caused the initial injury is compounded by the omission to move B to a safer place or call for assistance. But let us assume that A never averts the possibility of further injury. The issue is now the extent to which knowledge may be imputed objectively.|$|E
25|$|The game {{features}} assault rifles, sub-machine guns, pistols, missile launchers, shotguns, miniguns, sniper rifles, gauss rifles (or coilgun), the MOAC (a machine-gun-like alien weapon which fires high-velocity ice shards), and the TAC gun (a hand-held nuclear grenade launcher). Most weapons can {{be modified}} with attachments; these attachments may {{be given to the}} player by default, acquired from picked-up weapons, or purchased in multiplayer. Attachment options are given a fair amount of leeway even if the end result may seem strange. For instance, a 4x/10x sniper scope can be attached to the buckshot-firing shotgun, though <b>obviously</b> <b>there</b> is no practical use for such a combination. Additionally, most weapons have multiple firing modes (single/automatic fire) and different ammo types; for example, the KPA's FY-71 can fire both conventional bullets as well as incendiary bullets, which increase damage. Crysis also incorporates some features that have appeared in other recent shooters such as accounting for already-chambered rounds when a reload occurs.|$|E

[...] Republican strategist Matthew Dowd said, [...] "There's <b>obviously</b> something <b>there,</b> because if there was nothing there, he would say, ‘Have at it.'

[...] Noting the singles [...] "Goodies," [...] "1, 2 Step," [...] and [...] "Oh" [...] as {{standout}} tracks, Allmusic gave the album {{three and a half}} out of five stars. Steve Jones of USA Today said, [...] "The voice doesn't blow you away, but as with Goodies, she takes a lyrically intriguing offbeat path from time to time. Though not every song is a goodie, she does have a few treats in store." [...] Even though he said the album wasn't a perfect work, Azeem Ahmad of musicOMH said, [...] "The talent is <b>obviously</b> <b>there</b> but if we are to carry out Ciara's wish of forgetting about [...] "the other chicks" [...] then there's some fine-tuning needed. For now there's no direct threat to any other hip-hop divas, but the void left by Aaliyah is still there for someone to try and fill. There's no reason why Ciara can't one day hold her own with the best." [...] Jalylah Burrell of PopMatters commented that [...] "Goodies is nothing new, but it is executed well." ...|$|E

There are elements of new wave, as well as some really dark hip-hop and soul influences, and even some indie references.

2500|$|At Seleucia on the Tigris, {{there is}} a statue of a goddess, which clearly {{originates}} in Hellenistic tradition. It is a 56cm Kompositfigur from Marnor made of alabaster, plaster and bitumen. The woman is wearing a chiton and a cloak over it. On her head {{there is a}} tiara. [...] Accurate dating {{of the work is}} almost impossible, but it was found in sections of the city by the excavators and is associated with the conquest of the city by the Roman emperor Trajan (116 AD). From the same town comes a bronze figure of Hercules. According to the inscription it comes from the Charakene (a part of the Parthian Empire) around 150 AD as booty in the city and there adorned the Temple of Apollo. The work is clearly Hellenistic, but it was in the Charakene for nearly 300 years before it came to Seleucia. <b>Obviously,</b> <b>there</b> were Parthian demands to continue works of art in Hellenistic style.|$|E
2500|$|Jamie Russell, Michigan Tech's eighth-year head coach, {{resigned}} {{following the}} 2010–11 season, {{in which the}} Huskies won 4games and endured a 26‑game winless streak. [...] "The best memories are of {{the players and the}} guys I've worked with, that's what I'll remember", Russell said. [...] "Successes, <b>obviously,</b> <b>there</b> weren't enough of them." [...] Russell accepted an assistant coaching position with Providence a few months later. Michigan Tech athletic director Suzanne Sanregret began searching for Russell's replacement immediately after his resignation, saying university president Glenn Mroz gave her the authority and many alumni gave her the resources to [...] "go after the best coach". Among Sanregret's interviewees were Michigan Tech alumnus and Michigan associate coach Mel Pearson, Nebraska–Omaha associate coach Mike Hastings and Green Bay (USHL) head coach Eric Rud. Pearson's interview took place four days after his team lost the NCAA DivisionI national championship game to Minnesota–Duluth, and when Sanregret gave him 48hours to decide whether to accept the position, he ultimately could not say yes. [...] "ith everything going on, it was just a tough time to make ... a life-changing decision", Pearson said. [...] "So I just think I went with the safe way and said no".|$|E
2500|$|At {{the close}} of the band's tour in support of Light Grenades (2006), the band entered an {{extended}} hiatus. Vocalist Brandon Boyd noted, [...] "It's not that we were burned out being in a band or being in this band; I think that we, collectively, were feeling like if we didn't step away from this monster that we created then it would begin to consume us. [...] We had to plant some roots, lest we start to write songs about living on a tour bus. So we had to fall in love, we had to fall out of love, we had to make homes." [...] Guitarist Michael Einziger elaborated further, [...] "It just got to this point where we had been going strong for such {{a long period of time}} that we really accomplished all of our goals.

The driver said she had no idea who Girardi was until the responding officers identified him.

2500|$|He {{had been}} the co-founder of the Theatine Order, and was a {{promoter}} of reform in the Church. [...] He was no humanist, however, and preferred the doctrine of Thomas Aquinas. He was also a vigorous opponent of Protestantism, and anything that favored it. He saw heretics everywhere, even inside the College of Cardinals, and as an Inquisitor he showed no scruple or mercy {{for those who were}} tainted. Showing all of the traditional prejudices against the Jews, and especially against converted Jews, he issued a bull on July 14, 1555, Cum nimis absurdum, creating the Jewish Ghetto of Rome. He refused to recognize the election of Ferdinand I as Holy Roman Emperor, and he refused to recognize the retirement of Charles V. He ruled until his death on August 18, 1559, or rather his nephew, Cardinal Carlo Carafa, did. It was only three months before his death that Paul IV was fully informed of the misdeeds of his nephews, Cardinal Carafa, Giovanni Caraffa Duke of Paliano, and Antonio Carafa Marchese of Montebello. When the Florentine Ambassador, Bongiano Gianfiliazzi, had attempted to have an audience with Paul IV to enlighten him about his corrupt nephews, the door was slammed in his face by Cardinal Carafa. <b>Obviously,</b> <b>there</b> was no room in the Curia for the advice of Cardinal Farnese. There was considerable danger to Farnese properties because of Paul IV's anti-imperial policy.|$|E
2500|$|Horrobin, within {{several years}} of {{founding}} Efamol, was selling EPO in more than 25 countries. He marketed the supplement {{as a treatment for}} [...] "PMS, alcoholism, pregnancy-induced hypertension, atopic eczema, elevated cholesterol levels, hypertension, scleroderma, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, mastalgia (breast pain) and other problems", but according to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Horrobin did not satisfactorily demonstrate the efficacy and safety of his supplement. The FDA advised Efamol not to ship EPO to the United States without obtaining approval. Horrobin agreed, but began making shipments. Horrobin conspired with General Nutrition, Inc. to process Efamol into capsules in California; it would then be sold to General Nutrition and relabeled for resale under a different brand name. According to an FDA investigation, Horrobin suggested marketing strategies to circumvent the laws, including coaching retail representatives on making oral claims to customers, [...] "planting articles on their research in the media, deploying researchers to make claims on their behalf, using radio phone-ins" [...] and other tactics. Horrobin wrote to General Nutrition, [...] "Obviously you could not advertise Efamol for these purposes but equally <b>obviously</b> <b>there</b> are ways of getting the information across". As a result, the FDA began to seize shipments of EPO and handed down felony indictments to General Nutrition, several executives and store managers for [...] "conspiring to defraud the FDA and violating provisions of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act". General Nutrition and its president entered guilty pleas and paid fines, but Horrobin was not prosecuted.|$|E
2500|$|Wilford's right hand, {{the second}} in command on the train and has been the {{spokesperson}} for Wilford for the past 17 years. About the character, Swinton said, [...] "Mason is a pretty monstrous construct so we felt {{we were dealing with}} extremes, but the truth was that we didn't have to go that far. Look at Hitler with his dyed black hair and Gaddafi with handmade medals stuck on his jacket." [...] Swinton prepared for the role by studying clowning politicians throughout history, and Mason is, in Swinton's words, [...] "a complete smash cut of all the monstrous, maniacal, political clowns." [...] Swinton added that the character is a mix of Margaret Thatcher, Colonel Gaddafi, Adolf Hitler and Silvio Berlusconi. The Lancashire accent Swinton uses is based on someone from her early life who had the accent and to her, [...] "was an early example of authority". Tilda and Bong met at the Cannes Film Festival when We Need to Talk About Kevin played and both wanted to work together. In one original scenario, Mason was a middle-aged man and first mentioned as [...] "peaceful", so Bong changed it and offered it to Swinton. Bong added, [...] "I originally talked to John C. Reilly about playing Mason." [...] On Mason's appearance, Bong stated, [...] "Tilda actually wanted to take the look further and I had to pull her back. She at the time really wanted to transform herself and look different than she ever looked before. I was all for it. <b>Obviously</b> <b>there</b> was something that started the whole look." [...] Additionally Swinton stated, [...] "As we were playing we had these ideas, like fantastic pendulous breasts [...] And Jamie Bell loved wearing them of course. We have a picture of him. Our crew picture involves [...] wearing Mason's breasts." [...] Bong was inspired by a photo Ondrej Nekvasil found of a lady inside the National Museum of Natural History, and he showed the image to Tilda who [...] "loved it". The appearance of Mason was based on Roxie Collie Laybourne.|$|E

McCartney explained the song by saying: [...] "'Lady Madonna' started off as the Virgin Mary, then it was a working-class woman, of which <b>obviously</b> <b>there's</b> millions in Liverpool. There are a lot of Catholics in Liverpool because of the Irish connection." [...] The lyrics include each day of the week except Saturday. In a 1992 interview, McCartney, who only realised the omission of Saturday many years later, half-jokingly suggested that, given the difficulties of the other six days, the woman in the song likely went out and had a good time that day.|$|R
