40|$|OBJECTIVE: Brain-computer {{interfaces}} (BCIs) implemented with real-time functional {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (rt-fMRI) use fMRI time-courses from predefined regions of interest (ROIs). To reach best performances, localizer experiments and <b>on-site</b> expert <b>supervision</b> are required for ROI definition. To automate this step, we developed two unsupervised computational techniques based on the general linear model (GLM) and independent component analysis (ICA) of rt-fMRI data, and compared their performances on a communication BCI.  Approach. 3 T fMRI data of six volunteers were re-analyzed in simulated real-time. During a localizer run, participants performed three mental tasks following visual cues. During two communication runs, a letter-spelling display guided the subjects to freely encode letters by performing one of the mental tasks with a specific timing. GLM- and ICA-based procedures were used to decode each letter, respectively using compact ROIs and whole-brain distributed spatio-temporal patterns of fMRI activity, automatically defined from subject-specific or group-level maps. MAIN RESULTS: Letter-decoding performances were comparable to supervised methods. In combination with a similarity-based criterion, GLM- and ICA-based approaches successfully decoded more than 80 % (average) of the letters. Subject-specific maps yielded optimal performances.  Significance. Automated solutions for ROI selection may help accelerating the translation of rt-fMRI BCIs from research to clinical applications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Effective {{management}} {{and evaluation of}} <b>on-site</b> <b>supervision</b> staffs in large hydropower project is a key method to strengthen management, improve efficiency, and ensure the progress and quality of projects. A new method based on smart phones and real-time tracking technology was developed to manage and evaluate <b>on-site</b> <b>supervision</b> staffs. The location information of supervisors at the construction site is collected and uploaded to the server by smart phones containing a GPS data uploading application. The server stores and processes the data, and displays the location and the track of staffs on the web page to achieve real-time monitoring. The collected GPS data is deeply analyzed to identify the specific work context of supervisors and to build 3 indicators: Field Work Time, Effective Work Time and Effective Work Scope which are effective indicators to measure the workload. The feasibility of the method was verified by simulation experiments. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed method can determine the real-time position of supervisors accurately, and identify their work contexts effectively.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical outcomes of a method to leverage existing home healthcare telemonitoring technology to deliver depression care management (DCM) to both Spanish- and English-speaking elderly homebound recipients of homecare services. Materials and Methods: Three stand-alone, nonprofit community homecare agencies located in New York, Vermont, and Miami participated in this study. Evidence-based DCM was adapted to the telemonitor platform by programming questions and educational information on depression symptoms, antidepressant adherence, and side effects. Recruited patients participated for a minimum of 3 weeks. Telehealth nurses were trained on DCM and received biweekly <b>supervision.</b> <b>On-site</b> trained research assistants conducted in-home research interviews on depression diagnosis and severity and patient satisfaction with the protocol. Results: An ethnically diverse sample of 48 English- and Spanish-only- speaking patients participated, along with seven telehealth nurses. Both patients and telehealth nurses reported high levels of protocol acceptance. Among 19 patients meeting diagnostic criteria for major depression, the mean depression severity was in the 2 ̆ 2 markedly severe 2 ̆ 2 range at baseline and in the 2 ̆ 2 mild 2 ̆ 2 range at follow-up. Conclusions: Results of this pilot support the feasibility of using homecare 2 ̆ 7 s existing telemonitoring technology to deliver DCM to their elderly homebound patients.

40|$|Background: The Mexican {{mandatory}} year {{of social}} service following medical school, or pasantía, {{is designed to}} provide a safety net for the underserved. However, social service physicians (pasantes) are typically unpracticed, unsupervised, and unsupported. Significant demotivation, absenteeism, and underperformance typically plague the social service year. Objective: Compañeros en Salud (CES) aimed to create an education-support package to turn the pasantía into a transformative learning experience. Design: CES recruited pasantes to complete their pasantía in CES-supported Ministry of Health clinics in rural Chiapas. The program aims to: 1) train pasantes to more effectively deliver primary care, 2) expose pasantes to central concepts of global health and social medicine, and 3) foster career development of pasantes. Program components include supportive <b>supervision,</b> <b>on-site</b> mentorship, clinical information resources, monthly interactive seminars, and improved clinic function. We report quantitative and qualitative pasante survey data collected from February 2012 to August 2013 to discuss strengths and weaknesses of this program and its implications for the pasante workforce in Mexico. Results: Pasantes reported that their medical knowledge, and clinical and leadership skills all improved during the CES education-support program. Most pasantes felt the program had an overall positive effect on their career goals and plans, although their self-report of preparedness for the Mexican residency entrance exam (ENARM) decreased during the social service year. One hundred percent reported they were satisfied with the CES-supported pasantía experience and wished to help the poor and underserved in their careers. Conclusions: Education-support programs similar to the CES program may encourage graduating medical students to complete their social service in underserved areas, improve the quality of care provided by pasantes, and address many of the known shortcomings of the pasantía. Additional efforts should focus on developing a strategy to expand this education-support model so that more pasantes throughout Mexico can experience a transformative, career-building, social service year...|$|R
