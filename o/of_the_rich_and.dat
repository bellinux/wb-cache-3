5|$|As {{the revolt}} and raids were {{occurring}} in Campania, {{which was a}} vacation region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> influential in Rome, {{and the location of}} many estates, the revolt quickly {{came to the attention of}} Roman authorities.

5|$|Zoology is {{discussed}} in Books VIII to XI. The encyclopedia mentions different sources of purple dye, particularly the murex snail, the highly prized source of Tyrian purple. It describes the elephant and hippopotamus in detail, {{as well as the}} value and origin of the pearl and the invention of fish farming and oyster farming. The keeping of aquariums was a popular pastime <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich,</b> <b>and</b> Pliny provides anecdotes of the problems of owners becoming too closely attached to their fish.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, Emma Cons, a Victorian philanthropist {{who ran the}} Old Vic theatre in {{a working-class}} area of London, began {{presenting}} regular fortnightly performances of opera excerpts. Although the theatre licensing laws of the day prevented full costumed performances, Cons presented condensed versions of well-known operas, always sung in English. Among the performers were noted singers such as Charles Santley. These operatic evenings quickly became more popular than the dramas that Cons had been staging separately. In 1898, she recruited her niece Lilian Baylis to help run the theatre. At {{the same time she}} appointed Charles Corri as the Old Vic's musical director. Baylis and Corri, despite many disagreements, shared a passionate belief in popularising opera, hitherto generally the preserve <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> fashionable. They worked on a tiny budget, with an amateur chorus and a professional orchestra of only 18 players, for whom Corri rescored the instrumental parts of the operas. By {{the early years of the}} 20th century, the Old Vic was able to present semi-staged versions of Wagner operas.|$|E

5|$|In 1987, Brown again ran for governor, {{entering}} a crowded Democratic primary that included Lieutenant Governor Steve Beshear, former governor Julian Carroll, Grady Stumbo, and political newcomer Wallace Wilkinson. He entered the race late – filing his candidacy papers in late February before the primary election in late May. When Brown approached {{the state capitol}} to file his papers, Beshear met him outside the filing office and challenged him to an impromptu debate, but Brown declined. As Brown quickly became the frontrunner, Beshear attacked his lavish lifestyle {{in a series of}} campaign ads, one of which was based on the popular television show Lifestyles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rich</b> <b>and</b> Famous. Other ads by Beshear played up Brown's ties to James P. Lambert, while still others claimed that Brown would raise taxes. Brown refuted Beshear's claims in ads of his own, and the battle between Beshear and Brown opened an opportunity for Wilkinson – who distinguished himself from the field by advocating for a state lottery – to make a late surge. He defeated Brown, his closest competitor, by a margin of 58,000 votes.|$|E

25|$|Mendelssohn's {{great success}} in England from 1829 {{until the end}} of his life also {{reflected}} well on his friend. Although Moscheles's music was now being looked on as a little old-fashioned, he was heavily in demand as a music teacher and included amongst his pupils many children <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> aristocratic classes. He was also appointed 'Pianist to Prince Albert', a sinecure which nevertheless confirmed his status.|$|E
25|$|The huge {{losses on}} the battlefields were {{not limited to}} men. The army quickly ran short of rifles and {{ammunition}} (as well as uniforms and food), and, by mid-1915, men were {{being sent to the}} front bearing no arms. It was hoped that they could equip themselves with the arms that they recovered from fallen soldiers, of both sides, on the battlefields. The soldiers did not feel that they were being treated as human beings, or even as valuable soldiers, but rather as raw materials to be squandered for the purposes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> powerful.|$|E

25|$|Social Darwinism {{suggested}} {{that the success of}} these different ethnic groups in world affairs, and social classes in a society, were the result of evolutionary struggle in which the group or class more fit to succeed did so; i.e., the ability of an ethnic group to dominate other ethnic groups, or the chance to succeed or rise to the top of society was determined by genetic superiority. In more modern times it is typically seen as dubious and unscientific for its apparent use of Darwin's ideas to justify the position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> powerful, or dominant ethnic groups.|$|E
25|$|Sociologists Dennis Gilbert, William Thompson, Joseph Hickey, and James Henslin have {{proposed}} class systems with six distinct social classes.

25|$|Of a {{firm and}} unselfish but abrupt and passionate disposition, Ashkenazi {{everywhere}} aroused the discontent and hatred <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> the scholarly. Extensive learning, keen intelligence, and exceptional linguistic attainments, all combined {{to make him}} one of the most distinguished men of his day. All his contemporaries, even those who knew him only {{as the head of the}} Klaus at Altona, unite in praising his profound learning, his astuteness, his clearness of exposition, which never degenerated into the subtleties of the pilpul, and his absolute disregard for the influence of money. He would suffer serious deprivation rather than accept pecuniary assistance; and this characteristic, interpreted by the wealthy of that day as obstinacy and arrogance, became to him a source of much suffering and enmity.|$|E
25|$|Twitty {{lived for}} many years in Hendersonville, Tennessee, just north of Nashville, where he built a country music {{entertainment}} complex called Twitty City at a cost of over $3.5 million. Twitty and Twitty City were once featured on the TV series Lifestyles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rich</b> <b>and</b> Famous. and was also seen in the Nashville episode of the BBC series Entertainment USA, presented by Jonathan King. Opened in 1982, it was a popular tourist stop throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s; it was shut down in 1994 following a year-long tribute show called Final Touches, when fans and peers in the music business dropped by. The complex was auctioned off and bought by the Trinity Broadcasting Network the #1 Faith-based network in the world; now known as Trinity Music City, USA, but is no longer open to the public.|$|E

25|$|Within the West Park was {{a running}} stream {{and within the}} walled {{enclosure}} of the West Palace were two running streams, one connecting three ponds and another connecting two ponds. The small East Park had a pond the size {{of those in the}} West Palace. The Daming Palace and the Xingqing Palace (located along the eastern wall of the city) both had a small lake to boast, yet the Serpentine River Park had a large lake within its bounds that was bigger than the latter two lakes combined, connected at the southern end by a river that ran under the main walls and out of the city. There were 5 transport and sanitation canals running throughout the city, which had several different water sources, and delivered water to city parks, gardens <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich,</b> <b>and</b> the grounds of the imperial palaces. The sources of water came from a stream running through the Forbidden Park and under the northern city wall, two different running streams from outside the city in the south, a stream that fed into the pond of the walled East Park, which in turn fed into a canal that led to the inner city. These canal waterways in turn streamed water into the ponds of the West Palace while the lake in the Xingqing Palace connected two different canals running through the city. The canals were also used to transport crucial goods throughout the city, such as charcoal and fire wood in the winter.|$|E
25|$|During the reigns of Louis XIV. and XV. the {{principal}} merit of carved design, i.e. its appropriateness and suitability, gradually disappeared. Furniture was often carved {{in a way}} hardly legitimate. The legs, the rails of tables and chairs, the frames of cabinets, of looking-glasses, instead of being first made fcr construction and strength. and then decorated, were first designed to carry cherubs heads and rococo (i.e. rock and shell ornament), quite regardless of utility or convenience. A wealth of such mistaken design was also applied to state carriages, {{to say nothing of}} bedsteads and other furniture. However, the wall paneling of the mansions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich,</b> <b>and</b> sometimes the paneling of furniture, was decorated with rococo design in its least illegitimate form. The main part of the wood surface would be left plain, while the center would be carved with a medallion surrounded by foliage, vases or trophies of torches and musical instruments, etc., or perhaps {{the upper part of the}} panel would be thus treated. France led the fashion, which was more or less followed all over Europe. In England gilt chairs in the style of Louis XV. were made in some quantities. But Thomas Chippendale, Ince and Mayhew, Sheraton, Johnson, Heppelwhite and other cabinet-makers did not as a rule use much carving in their designs. Scrolls, shells, ribbon, ears of corn, etc., in very fine relief, were, however, used in the embellishment of chairs, etc., and the claw and ball foot was employed as a termination to the cabriole legs of cabinets and other furniture.|$|E
25|$|Aetius campaigned vigorously, {{somewhat}} {{stabilizing the}} situation in Gaul and in Hispania. He relied heavily on his forces of Huns. With a ferocity celebrated centuries later in the Nibelungenlied, the Huns slaughtered many Burgundians on the middle Rhine, re-establishing the survivors as Roman allies, the first Kingdom of the Burgundians. This may have returned some sort of Roman authority to Trier. Eastern troops reinforced Carthage, temporarily halting the Vandals, who in 435 agreed to limit themselves to Numidia and leave the most fertile parts of North Africa in peace. Aetius concentrated his limited military resources to defeat the Visigoths again, and his diplomacy restored a degree of order to Hispania. However, his general Litorius was badly defeated by the Visigoths at Toulouse, and a new Suevic king, Rechiar, began vigorous assaults on what remained of Roman Hispania. At one point Rechiar even allied with Bagaudae. These were Romans not under imperial control; some of their reasons for rebellion may be indicated by the remarks of a Roman captive under Attila who was happy in his lot, giving a lively account of the vices of a declining empire, {{of which he had}} so long been the victim; the cruel absurdity of the Roman princes, unable to protect their subjects against the public enemy, unwilling to trust them with arms for their own defence; the intolerable weight of taxes, rendered still more oppressive by the intricate or arbitrary modes of collection; the obscurity of numerous and contradictory laws; the tedious and expensive forms of judicial proceedings; the partial administration of justice; and the universal corruption, which increased the influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich,</b> <b>and</b> aggravated the misfortunes of the poor.|$|E
