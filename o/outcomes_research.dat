5|$|The University of Colorado's School of Pharmacy (SOP) {{began in}} 1911 as a {{division}} of the School of Medicine in Boulder. It became an independent college in 1913 and a school in 1957. It received its accreditation in 1938–1939 and awarded a B.S. in Pharmacy degree in 1995–1996 when it received a full accreditation status awarding the Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree by the ACPE. In 1986, the School of Pharmacy was administratively transferred to the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver. The physical transfer from Boulder and final consolidation of faculty, staff and students was completed between August and November 1992. In 2008, the school moved to the Anschutz Medical Campus, and offers medical and graduate degrees in pharmacy, the pharmaceutical sciences, molecular toxicology, and pharmaceutical <b>outcomes</b> <b>research.</b> 30% of its class is from out of state. In 2009, the NIH awarded $7,310,389 and $19,189,543 in grants towards the SOP and Pharmacology department, respectively. In 2011, the school will move into its new building, the Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences which will also be located on the Anschutz Medical Campus.|$|E

Interestingly, at {{the time}} of its withdrawal, rofecoxib was the only coxib with clinical evidence of its superior gastrointestinal adverse effect profile over conventional NSAIDs. This was largely based on the VIGOR (Vioxx GI <b>Outcomes</b> <b>Research)</b> study, which compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of rofecoxib and naproxen.|$|E

25|$|The VIGOR (Vioxx GI <b>Outcomes</b> <b>Research)</b> study, {{conducted}} by Bombardier, et al., which compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of rofecoxib and naproxen, had {{indicated a significant}} 4-fold increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) in rofecoxib patients when compared with naproxen patients (0.4% vs 0.1%, RR 0.25) over the 12-month span of the study. The elevated risk began during the second month on rofecoxib. There {{was no significant difference}} in the mortality from cardiovascular events between the two groups, nor was there any significant difference in the rate of myocardial infarction between the rofecoxib and naproxen treatment groups in patients without high cardiovascular risk. The difference in overall risk was by the patients at higher risk of heart attack, i.e. those meeting the criteria for low-dose aspirin prophylaxis of secondary cardiovascular events (previous myocardial infarction, angina, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, or coronary artery bypass).|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} first {{selective}} COX-2 inhibitor was marketed, specialists began to suspect {{that there might be}} a cardiovascular risk associated with this class of medicines. In the VIGOR study (Vioxx Gastrointestinal <b>Outcomes</b> <b>Research),</b> rofecoxib (Vioxx) was compared to naproxen. After a short time, it became evident that there was a fivefold higher risk of myocardial infarction in the rofecoxib group compared to the group that received naproxen. The authors suggested that the difference was due to the cardioprotective effects of naproxen. The APPROVe (Adenomatous Poly Prevention on Vioxx) study was a multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind trial aimed to assess the effect of three-year treatment with rofecoxib on recurrence of neoplastic polyps in individuals with a history of colorectal adenomas. In 2000 and 2001, 2587 patients with a history of colorectal adenomas were recruited and followed. The trial was stopped early (2 months before expected completion) on recommendations of its data safety and monitoring board because of concerns about cardiovascular toxicity. When looking at the results of the study, it showed a statistically significant increase in cardiovascular risk when taking rofecoxib compared to placebo beginning after 18 months of treatment. Then on 30 September Merck gave out a news release announcing their voluntary worldwide withdrawal of Vioxx.|$|E

40|$|Ideally, {{there is}} a close {{interaction}} between research and practice in human services, and program planning is based on such interaction, particularly the findings of <b>outcome</b> <b>research.</b> This book reviews the bodies of <b>outcome</b> <b>research</b> about child welfare programs from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, particularly outcomes in relation to service effectiveness, duration of child placement, permanency planning, and child development and functioning. The purpose {{of the book is}} to give child welfare administrators, policymakers, practitioners, and academics a comprehensive picture of the current state of child welfare knowledge. Chapter 1 discusses issues related to carrying out <b>outcome</b> <b>research</b> and describes the different service systems in the three countries. Chapter 2 examines <b>outcome</b> <b>research</b> in traditional services, such as kinship care, family foster care, treatment foster care, residential group care, and adoption. Chapter 3 reviews research findings related to outcomes of more recent service initiatives, including family preservation, family reunification, preparation for independent living, the "Looking After Children" administrative materials used in the United Kingdom, family group decision making, shared family care, and wraparound services. The book concludes by asserting {{that there are a number}} of gaps in the available research, including limited comparative studies of the outcomes of such services as adoption, family foster care, and residential care, and limited attention to the dimension of race and ethnicity. Recommendations include greater attention to the role of race and ethnicity and more cross-national research.

2500|$|A 2001 {{analysis}} {{published in}} the alternative-medicine literature explored the feasibility of using the Bio Medical Center's records in Tijuana {{as the basis for}} <b>outcomes</b> <b>research</b> on Hoxsey Therapy. Of 149 patients treated for cancer at the Bio Medical Center in 1992, the authors found that less than half of these patient records contained pathology reports verifying a cancer diagnosis. Additionally, 60%-90% had already received [...] "conventional" [...] treatment such as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy with a possible curative effect. The authors were able to verify survival status in only 57% of the treated patients, due to lack of documentation, follow-up, and identifying information in the Bio Medical Center charts. Of the cohort of 149 patients, 11% were still alive 5 years after treatment with Hoxsey Therapy; 46% had died; and 43% could not be located and their status could not be determined. The authors concluded that {{it was not possible to}} reliably assess the Bio Medical Center's outcomes because of the lack of documentation, limited follow-up, and failure to confirm in many cases the existence or stage of cancer.|$|E

40|$|Over {{six decades}} of {{psychotherapy}} <b>outcome</b> <b>research</b> {{has suggested that}} a few major factors consistently account {{for a majority of}} the variability observed in therapy <b>outcomes.</b> No <b>research</b> has examined what Psy.

40|$|Despite {{guidelines}} and repeated {{calls from the}} literature, statistical mediation analysis in youth treatment <b>outcome</b> <b>research</b> is rare. Even more concerning is that many studies that have reported mediation analyses do not fulfill basic requirements for mediation analysis, providing inconclusive data and clinical implications. As a result, after more than five decades of research, it is still largely unknown through which processes youth treatment works and what the effective treatment components are. In this article, we present ten {{ways in which the}} use of statistical mediation analysis in youth treatment <b>outcome</b> <b>research</b> may be improved. These ten ways are related both to conceptual and methodological issues. In discussing how youth clinical researchers may optimally implement these directions, we argue that studies should employ the strongest research designs possible. In so doing, we describe different levels of a mediation evidence ladder. Studies on each step of the ladder contribute to an understanding of mediation processes, but the strongest evidence for mediation is provided by studies that can be classified at the highest level. With the help of the ladder of mediation evidence, results from youth mediation treatment <b>outcome</b> <b>research</b> can be evaluated on their scientific as well as clinical impact...|$|R
