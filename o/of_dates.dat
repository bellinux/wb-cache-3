40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between personality and the recognition <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> DV in female university students. The structured sentence completion test (K-SCT) was used as the measurement of personality. The study surveyed 32 female university students. The results indicated that the relation between personality and recognition <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> DV was not observed. Thus, it was suggested that there are no associations between personality and types <b>of</b> victims <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> DV. In addition, an association between the recognition <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> DV and 2 ̆ 2 attack 2 ̆ 2 was observed. Subjects who were ambivalent indicated in a higher risk <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> DV than subjects who were positive against attack. The results indicated that subjects who are ambivalent have mixed positive and negative feelings, and this leads to a conflict against attack. Thus, there was no relation between personality and recognition <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> DV found herein, but personality was related to attack. Therefore, these findings can be applied to future prevention education <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> DV...|$|R

5|$|The {{painting}} was dated c. 1446 by Wolfgang Schöne in the 1930s, mainly by matching {{the style and}} fashion of her clothing to contemporary trends. In the early 20th century the dating and authorship of works then attributed to Christus were challenged. Max Friedländer proposed a number <b>of</b> <b>dates</b> and an ordering of works in the 1957 volume of his Early Netherlandish painting, but many of his assumptions were discounted by Otto Pächt {{just a few years}} later.|$|E
5|$|Dunster {{had become}} a centre for woollen and {{clothing}} production by the 13th century, with the market dating back to at least 1222, and {{a particular kind of}} kersey or broadcloth became known as 'Dunsters'. The prosperity of Dunster was based on the wool trade, with profits helping to pay for the construction of the tower of the Priory Church of St George and provide other amenities. By the 15th century the importance of the town was declining particularly due to the silting up of the harbour. The Luttrell's wanted to maintain the importance as a market and in 1609 George Luttrell, of the Luttrell family constructed the market to shelter traders and their wares from the rain and provide more security for their wares. The exact date of construction is debated and a variety <b>of</b> <b>dates</b> are given in different sources, however 1609 is considered the most likely.|$|E
5|$|During {{the making}} of his Bollywood {{director}}ial debut Nayak in early 2001, director S. Shankar had conceived a science fiction film titled Robot. A futuristic techno-thriller set in the 22nd century Chennai, the film was to feature Kamal Haasan and Preity Zinta in the lead roles. However, after completing a photo-shoot featuring the two, the production was shelved due to various reasons, including Haasan's unavailability <b>of</b> <b>dates,</b> creative differences with the director and lack of funding. Shankar postponed the project indefinitely and made the coming of age film, Boys (2003). When the post-production work of Boys was underway, Shankar was awaiting the return of its composer A. R. Rahman, who was then outside India, to complete the background score. In the meantime, Shankar had {{an idea for a}} storyline and called Vikram, who expressed enthusiasm for the subject.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Introduction & Objective:Dental caries {{is perhaps}} the most common {{bacterial}} infections in humans and Streptococcus Mutans {{is one of the most}} important factors in dental caries. Research has shown that some kind foods have an inhibitory effect on cariogenic factors of Mutans streptococci. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect <b>of</b> <b>date</b> extract on growth of Streptococcus Mutans. Methods & Materials: This experimental study was down at faculty of medicine, Yasuj university of medical sciences with collaborative of microbiology department of Shiraz university of medical sciences in 2005. In an In-vitro study, effect <b>of</b> <b>date</b> extract on growth of Mutans Streptococci was surveyed. After collecting of Streptococcus Mutans from dental caries those were cultured in different medium <b>of</b> <b>date</b> fruit, extract <b>of</b> <b>date</b> fruit and syrup <b>of</b> <b>date</b> with different concentrations. Results: Following 24 hours, Streptococcus mutans was grown in less concentration <b>of</b> <b>date</b> mediums and its grown was inhibited in more concentrations. Conclusion: With respect of inhibitory effect <b>of</b> <b>date</b> extract on growth of Streptococcus mutans,it might be introduced that date as a source of food has a preventive effect on dental caries...|$|R
40|$|Using a purposive {{sampling}} technique, this study employed an online questionnaire {{to assess the}} relationship between attitudes towards gender-related constructs (e. g. rape myth acceptance, shared power in relationships, the acceptability <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> violence and perceived seriousness <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> violence) and the tolerance <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> violence among undergraduate students in the Faculty of Social Science at the University of Ottawa. Linear regression models were conducted to identify the most salient predictors of the tolerance <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> violence. A general/combined model was examined as well as three subtype-specific models (e. g. psychological, physical and sexual dating violence). A total of seven predictor variables were entered into each model in three blocks: sociodemographic variables were entered first, followed by sex and then gender-related constructs (e. g. rape myth acceptance, power in relationships, the acceptability and seriousness <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> violence). The results identify a number of variables {{that are associated with}} the tolerance <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> violence scales and some that led to a decrease in scores on these scales. Findings suggest that the link between gender-related constructs and the tolerance <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> violence is complex and multidimensional and warrants further research to explain the variation observed...|$|R

5|$|In 2010, {{a genetic}} study was made basing on the {{evolutionary}} history of common elands. Located in the sub-Saharan savanna biome of east and southern Africa, the study used methods like analysis of mitochondrial DNA control-region fragments from 122 individuals {{to learn more}} about various topics, such as the phylogeography, genetic diversity, demographic history of the species. The conclusions strongly supported the presence of a longer-standing population in the south and a mosaic of Pleistocene refugia in the east. It is believed that today their extinction from these parts could be due to colonization. The similarity <b>of</b> <b>dates</b> obtained from more studies indicates a significant event c. 200 ka, which had brought a great change in the genetic history of the species.|$|E
5|$|In early 2013, {{the band}} {{revealed}} {{a new album}} was in the works, and eventually the first single, Silver and Gold was released as a vinyl and free online download. The single received significant radio airplay following its release. The album, Blackbird was released on the 21st of June in Ireland and in most regions, and on the 24th in others. The album debuted in the number 1 position on the New Zealand album chart and remained in that position for 4 weeks. The band went on a national tour of Australia in late August/early September where they appeared at the Splendour in the Grass festival, and will head to Europe for a string <b>of</b> <b>dates</b> immediately after.|$|E
5|$|Krips {{left the}} LSO in 1954, and the {{following}} year tensions between the orchestral principals and the rank-and-file players erupted into an irreconcilable dispute. The principals argued {{that the future of}} the LSO lay in profitable session work for film companies, rather than in the overcrowded field of London concerts. They also wished to be free to accept such engagements individually, absenting themselves from concerts if there were a clash <b>of</b> <b>dates.</b> The LSO's board, which reflected the majority opinion of the players, refused to accommodate the principals, most of whom resigned en masse, to form the Sinfonia of London, a session ensemble that flourished from the mid-1950s to the early 1960s, and then faded away. For fifteen years after the split the LSO did little film work, recording only six soundtracks between 1956 and 1971, compared with more than 70 films between 1940 and 1955.|$|E

5|$|Leaving Venice on 12 March, the Mozarts {{journeyed to}} Padua, where during {{a day of}} {{sightseeing}} Wolfgang was commissioned by Don Giuseppe Ximenes, Prince of Aragon, to compose an oratorio for the city. The history of La Betulia Liberata ("The Liberation of Bethulia") is obscure—it {{may not have been}} performed in Padua, or at all in Wolfgang's lifetime. In Verona, a few days later, he received further commissions. Wolfgang was to compose a serenata (or one-act opera) to be performed in Milan in October 1771 for the wedding of the Archduke Ferdinand and his bride Princess Beatrice of Modena. At the same time the young composer was engaged to undertake another Milan carnival opera, for the 1772–73 season, at an increased fee. This created a conflict <b>of</b> <b>dates</b> which prevented Wolfgang from proceeding with the San Benedetto contract. Thereafter, father and son sped northward, arriving home in Salzburg on 28 March 1771.|$|E
5|$|Radiocarbon {{dates are}} {{generally}} {{presented with a}} range of one standard deviation (usually represented by the Greek letter sigma as 1σ) {{on either side of the}} mean. However, a date range of 1σ represents only 68% confidence level, so the true age of the object being measured may lie outside the range <b>of</b> <b>dates</b> quoted. This was demonstrated in 1970 by an experiment run by the British Museum radiocarbon laboratory, in which weekly measurements were taken on the same sample for six months. The results varied widely (though consistently with a normal distribution of errors in the measurements), and included multiple date ranges (of 1σ confidence) that did not overlap with each other. The measurements included one with a range from about 4250 to about 4390 years ago, and another with a range from about 4520 to about 4690.|$|E
5|$|The Chess Olympiad was {{initially}} {{planned to take}} place from 17 to 30 September 2016.

On February 16, FIDE announced that the dates for the Olympiad have been moved to 1–14 September, while the dates for the 87th FIDE Congress to 4–14 September 2016. FIDE have also approached the organisers of the World Youth Chess Championship in Khanty Mansiysk, who were able to change their dates to 20 September–4 October 2016, in order to avoid clash <b>of</b> <b>dates.</b> On 18 February, the organisers of the Sinquefield Cup 2016 announced that the dates for their tournament had been moved to 4–16 August because of the rescheduling of the Olympiad.|$|E
