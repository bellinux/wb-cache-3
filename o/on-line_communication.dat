Firstly, with Professor Renaud Koechlin, at Hopital Foch in Suresnes, Paris, he developed the first satellite transmission interface device for tele-diagnosis of vectorcardiograms. Telediagnosis was made between the University of Tours, France and Washington University, St Louis, Missouri, in the United States via satellite and <b>on-line</b> <b>communication</b> with computer systems. He was asked to demonstrate his work to General Charles de Gaulle {{and members of the}} French government. He was then asked to join the Electronique Appliquée Laboratoire (ELA) in Montrouge, France. There he developed the first European prototype of an implantable on-demand cardiac pacemaker. The prototype was implanted in Paris in October 1967 for the first time by dr. Mugica at Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, during a midnight emergency intervention. Despite the lack of animal trials, the pacemaker saved the patient’s life and allowed him to live for several more years. Today, Cywinski-type on-demand pacers are still manufactured by the ELA-SORIN factory and widely used throughout the world.|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{we propose}} a Two-tier Overlay Multicast Architecture (TOMA) to provide {{scalable}} and efficient multicast {{support for a}} variety of group communication applications. In TOMA, Multicast Service Overlay Network (MSON) is advocated as the backbone service domain, while end users in the access domains form a number of small clusters, in which an application-layer multicast protocol is used for the communication between the clustered end users. Our two-tier architecture is able to provide efficient resource utilization with less control overhead, especially for large-scale applications. It also alleviates the forwarding state scalability problem and simplifies multicast tree construction and maintenance when there are large numbers of groups ongoing in the networks. We conduct simulation studies and the preliminary results demonstrate the promising performance of TOMA. Currently, {{we are in the process}} of implementing TOMA in a commercial <b>on-line</b> audio/vedio <b>communication</b> system, iVisit, to check the feasibility of TOMA and to further investigate its performance in real environments...|$|R
