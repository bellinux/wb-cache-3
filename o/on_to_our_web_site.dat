You sometimes hear people saying that senior house officers (SHOs) in emergency depart-ments are not what they used to be. We studied data collected over a five year period (1996 – 2001) on the number of patients seen by all SHOs who completed a six month post in our A&E department. The 118 SHOs (62 male and 56 female) worked a full shift rota averaging 52 hours per week. The influence of the sex of the doctor and their future career plan on the num-ber of patients they saw was also assessed. The number of patients seen by each SHO in six months ranged from 1069 to 2659 (mean 1774, SD 346). On average the SHOs working between August 1996 and January 1999 saw 154 more patients than those working between February 1999 and July 2001 (p= 0. 015; unpaired t test). Male SHOs saw on average 217. 5 patients (range 1121 to 2659) more than female SHOs (range 1069 to 2644) (p= 0. 001; unpaired t test). The med-ian number of patients seen by SHOs with a surgical interest was 1831 (interquartile range 1624 to 2024), and by those with a medi-cal one was 1684 (interquartile range 1497 t...|$|E

In this paper, we propose a visual interface that makes use of this clustering technique to explain the filtering results. The items in the database are laid out on a 2 dimensional map according to content-based similarity. A technique called "dynamic filtering" shows relationship between the items based on social similarity. The social and content-based clusters are visualized as landmarks <b>on</b> the map <b>to</b> enhance comprehensibility of the map. Visualization of both social and content-based spaces on a map combines their own advantages on information browsing: specialization of filtering results in the content-based space and serendipitous information discovery in the social space.

Under this broad definition, an interactive bilingual concordancing tool like the RALI’s TransSearch system certainly qualifies as a {{translation memory}}. This paper describes the Web-based version of TransSearch, which, for the last three years, has given Internet users access to a large English-French translation database made up of Canadian parliamentary debates. Despite the fact that the RALI has done very little to publicize the availability of TransSearch on the Web, the system has been attracting a growing and impressive number of users. We present some basic data on who is using TransSearch and how, data which was collected from the system’s log file and by means of a questionnaire recently added <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>Web</b> site.

Especially since the usage fees for packet-data access {{dropped to a}} point where anybody who can can afford a mobile phone can afford mobile Internet access. Almost every mobile phone today comes with an integrated web browser that can display HTML web pages and execute JavaScript. Almost all major web sites such as news sites, social networks, and shopping sites run websites that are optimized for small displays of mobile phones. Due to the broad use of mobile web access we investigated possible privacy problems of mobile phone web access. We conducted a study where we monitor all HTTP headers sent from mobile phones <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>web</b> server. We analyzed the logged data for privacy problems. Through this study we determined that a world wide privacy problem exists when accessing the world wide web from a mobile phone. We show what kind of data is leaked and who leaks it...|$|R

The test protocol specifies detailed procedures for setting up the test, executing the test, and measuring the test results.

Applications: This project will provide a resource for Idaho National Labs to quantitavely evaluate {{the effectiveness}} of their security awareness program in regards to phishing attacks.

40|$|Our basic storyline {{is how the}} {{business}} and economics higher education landscape has changed {{with the introduction of}} the Bologna programs. We borrowed the fashionable long tail concept from e-business, and used it for modeling the new landscape of internationalization of universities. Internationalization, mobility, and the appearance of the internet generation at the gates of our universities in our opinion has brought us to a new e-era which, appropriately <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>web</b> analogies we might as well call Education 2. 0. In our paper first we show the characteristics of the long tail model of the Bologna-based European higher education and potential messages for strategy making in this environment. We illustrate that benchmarking university strategies situated in the head of the long tail model will not always provide strategic guidance for universities sitting in the tail. For underlining some key concerns in the Hungarian niche, we used Corvinus University as a case study to illustrate some untapped challenges of the Hungarian Bologna reform. We explored three areas which are crucial elements of the “tail” strategy in our opinion: a) the influence of state regulation, b) social situations and impacts and c) internal university capabilities...|$|R
