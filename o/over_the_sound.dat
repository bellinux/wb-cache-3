5|$|Soon {{after he}} {{acquired}} the acoustic guitar, Hendrix formed his first band, the Velvetones. Without an electric guitar, {{he could barely}} be heard <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of the group. After about three months, {{he realized that he}} needed an electric guitar in order to continue. In mid-1959, his father relented and bought him a white Supro Ozark. Hendrix's first gig was with an unnamed band {{in the basement of a}} synagogue, Seattle's Temple De Hirsch, but after too much showing off, the band fired him between sets. He later joined the Rocking Kings, which played professionally at venues such as the Birdland club. When someone stole his guitar after he left it backstage overnight, Al bought him a red Silvertone Danelectro.|$|E
5|$|The game's visuals and {{spectacle}} were lauded {{by critics}} who suspected {{that it would}} amaze players. Reed questioned {{whether it was the}} best looking game to have ever been made. Critics observed that the use high frame rate and motion blur helped convey an incredible sense of speed. Other aspects such particle effects, reflections, and real-time deformation drew praise as well. Critics expressed approval <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> design of the cars and collisions. However opinions of the licensed soundtrack and DJ were less favourable. Some writers found the DJ's enthusiastic dialogue to be annoying and had mixed opinions on the songs included in the soundtrack, but were thankful for the available audio customisation options.|$|E

5|$|After Denmark ceded Norway to Sweden in 1814, Aalborg {{lost its}} {{important}} {{role as the}} country's centre for Norwegian trade. Its former prosperity also suffered {{as a result of}} difficulties with the herring industry as the fish disappeared after the sea breached the Agger Tange (which had linked Thy with the rest of Jutland at the western end of Limfjord) in the 1825 North Sea storm. The after effects of the state bankruptcy in 1813 also contributed to widespread poverty in the city. In the mid-19th-century, Aalborg was overtaken by Aarhus as the largest city in Jutland. Towards the end of the 19th century there was however an upturn. In 1865, the pontoon bridge over Limfjord was completed, and in 1869, the railway reached the city with a railway bridge <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> to Vendsyssel three years later. The harbour facilities were also improved, making Aalborg Denmark's second port. Aalborg became the country's main producer of tobacco products and spirits, followed in the 1890s by fertilisers and cement. By 1901, the population had increased to almost 31,500.|$|E

25|$|The {{accompaniment of}} the choirs also {{included}} a guitar and the percussion was executed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> box of an American banjo from which the strings were removed, {{due to the fact}} that African drums performance was strictly forbidden in Cuban cities. The style of the Coros de Clave music, and particulally its rhythm, originated at a later time a popular song genre called Clave, which most probable served as the original prototype for the creation of the Criolla genre. Both genres, the Clave and the Criolla became very popular within the Cuban vernacular theater repertoire.|$|E
25|$|The NTSB {{reviewed}} the 30-knot target track {{to try to}} determine why it did not divert from its course and proceed to {{the area where the}} TWA800 wreckage had fallen. TWA800 was behind the target, and with the likely forward-looking perspective of the target's occupant(s), the occupants would not have been in a position to observe the aircraft's breakup or subsequent explosions or fireball(s). Additionally, it was unlikely that the occupants of the target track {{would have been able to}} hear the explosions <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of its engines and the noise of the hull traveling through water, even more so if the occupants were in an enclosed bridge or cabin. Further, review of the Islip radar data for other similar summer days and nights in 1999 indicated that the 30-knot track was consistent with normal commercial fishing, recreational, and cargo vessel traffic.|$|E

In an interview for Billboard, Sia said, [...] "She [...] was just excited {{to get to work}} with the artists she loves. There's this misconception that she's a middle-America kind of person.

500|$|... "Dream Scene" [...] is a {{combination}} of segments that Harrison edited together. Along with [...] "Ski-ing", it is the only track on the album that combines Indian and Western music. The song consists of three distinct pieces, the first of which is a meditative section featuring phase-shifted instrumentation such as tabla tarang, harp (swarmandal) and sitar, and singing. The music is delivered via backwards-played tape loops as the vocals pan {{from one side to the}} other across the stereo image. The other two pieces include a section comprising Barham's piano and flutes, followed by a trumpet solo, harmonica interspersed with a police siren, and more backwards tape loops. The song fades out with a slowed-down spoken voice <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of church bells. Leng notes that [...] "Dream Scene" [...] was recorded several months before Lennon's experimental sound collage [...] "Revolution 9", released on the double album The Beatles.|$|E
500|$|In chapter 5 of [...] Ynglinga saga (as {{collected}} in Heimskringla), an euhemerized prose account relates that Odin sent Gefjun from Odense, Funen [...] "north <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> to seek for land." [...] There, Gefjun encountered king Gylfi [...] "and {{he gave her}} ploughland." [...] Gefjun went {{to the land of}} Jötunheimr, and there bore four sons to a jötunn (whose name is not provided). Gefjun transformed these four sons into oxen, attached them to a plough, and drew forth the land westward of the sea, opposite to Odense. The saga adds that this land is now called Zealand, and that Gefjun married Skjöldr (described here as [...] "a son of Odin"). The two dwelled in Lejre thereafter. From where Gefjun took the land that formed Zealand, a lake was left behind call Lögrinn, and the saga posits that the bays in lake Lögrinn correspond to the nesses of Zealand. This is followed by the same stanza used in Gylfaginning above composed by the skald Bragi Boddason.|$|E

The Punishment Due". [...] "Return to Hangar" [...] is a sequel to [...] "Hangar 18" [...] from Rust in Peace; the captive aliens from the first song escape and kill their captors. On the live albums Rude Awakening and [...] (2007) it is played back-to-back with [...] "Hangar 18".

The staff of WWC's main rival, the International Wrestling Association (IWA), {{was surprised by the}} event due to the promotion's previous association with WWE. They expected the tryout to conclude with the same outcome that the ones that WWE held with their talents (Germán Figueroa, Ricky Banderas and Andy Anderson) without any offer being made, deciding to counter the signing's impact with a storyline that benefited from it. The following month in the tour to promote the Summer Attitude 2003 event, the IWA began announcing the arrival of the [...] "son of a former world champion" [...] and [...] "legend that is universally recognized" [...] to the promotion, which was heavily implied to be Colón, but actually served as a plot device to introduce David Flair. Before the identity was revealed, his music was played <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> system, only for the crowd to be told by Savio Vega (Juan Rivera) that they should avoid [...] "acting like morons".|$|E
500|$|Carl Davis {{had been}} writing scores for BBC adaptations of classic novels {{since the mid-1970s}} and {{approached}} Sue Birtwistle during pre-production. Aiming to communicate the wit and vitality of the novel and its theme of marriage and love {{in a small town}} in the early 19th century, he used contemporary classical music as inspiration, in particular a popular Beethoven septet of the period, as well as a theme strongly reminiscent of the finale of Beethoven's Emperor Concerto. For control <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound,</b> the music was recorded in six hours by a group of up to 18 musicians and was then fed into tiny earpieces of the screen musicians, who mimed playing the instruments. The actresses whose characters played the piano, Lucy Briers (Mary) and Emilia Fox (Georgiana), were already accomplished pianists and were given the opportunity to practise weeks ahead of filming. Among the songs and movements that were played in the serial were Handel's [...] "Air con Variazioni" [...] from Suite No. 5 in E Major HWV 430 and [...] "Slumber, Dear Maid" [...] from his opera Xerxes, Mozart's [...] "Rondo Alla Turca", [...] "Voi Che Sapete" [...] and other music from his operas The Marriage of Figaro and Don Giovanni, Beethoven's Andante Favori, the second movement from Muzio Clementi's Sonatina No.4 and the traditional folk song [...] "The Barley Mow". A soundtrack with Davis's themes was released on CD in 1995.|$|E
50|$|Historically the boatswain's {{call was}} used to pass {{commands}} to the crew when the voice could not be heard <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of <b>the</b> sea. Because of its high pitch, it could be heard <b>over</b> <b>the</b> activities of the crew and bad weather. It is now used in traditional bugle calls such as Evening Colors/Sunset, and in other ceremonies in most modern navies. It is sometimes accompanied by other auditive features such as ruffles and flourishes, voice commands and announcements, or even a gun salute.|$|R
