5|$|Armada <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Damned</b> was {{conceived}} as an action-adventure role-playing video game played from a third-person perspective {{and set in}} an open world environment based on the Pirates of the Caribbean universe. The player {{was to take the}} role of James Sterling, a pirate captain whose main mission was to travel across the Caribbean Sea and make a reputation for himself. Some of Sterling's features could be directly customized by the player, although Armada <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Damned</b> was centered on a choice system that would affect the character's appearance, personality, weapons, attacks, quests, and story developments.|$|E

5|$|Combat in Armada <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Damned</b> {{was split}} between land and sea. Sterling had {{a light and}} a heavy attack, which could be {{combined}} to create combos that increased the damage he inflicted. Correct timing lead to a bonus attack {{at the end of}} the combo that improved its strength. Sterling could also curse his opponents. The curse was a spell that weakened all surrounding enemies when it was used as a finishing move. All attacks, special moves, and combinations varied depending of the pirate type chosen and could be upgraded at will.|$|E

5|$|The {{inscriptions}} {{follow the}} 14th-century convention of showing figures, imagery and motifs {{associated with the}} saved to Christ's right, and those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>damned</b> to his left. The words beneath the lily (the benedicti) read upwards towards Heaven, their curves leaning in towards Christ. The text to the left (the maledicti) flows in the opposite direction; from the highest point downwards. The inscriptions to Christ's right are decorated in light colours, {{to the extent that}} they are usually difficult to discern in reproductions. The lettering opposite faces downwards, and is applied with black paint.|$|E
5|$|The work's moralising tone is {{apparent}} {{from some of}} its more overtly dark iconography, its choice of saints, and how the scales tilt far lower beneath the weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>damned</b> than the saved. The damned to Christ's left are more numerous and less detailed than the saved to his right. In these ways it {{can be compared to}} Matthias Gr√ºnewald's Isenheim Altarpiece, which served much the same purpose, having been commissioned for the Monastery of St. Anthony in Isenheim, which cared for the dying.|$|E

5|$|Aegaeon‚Äì Featured in Ascension, Aegaeon the Hecatonchires had pledged a blood oath to Zeus, {{but later}} betrayed the god. The first {{victim of the}} Furies, they {{captured}} and tortured the multi-armed creature. Instead of killing him, the Furies turned him to stone, making him the giant Prison <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Damned</b> and becoming a symbol to all who may think of breaking a blood oath to a god. As Kratos attempted to escape the prison, Megaera used her parasitic insects to bring Aegaeon to life and control him as his many arms mutated into monstrous forms and began to attack the Spartan. Fending off two of its parasite-controlled arms, Megaera then infected Aegaeon's head, which attacked Kratos, but the Spartan outsmarted and killed Megaera; this also caused Aegaeon to die, freeing him from his suffering.|$|E

Sterling, raised in a poor family, was a young adventurer with dreams of fame and fortune who decided to become a pirate. Although he was killed on his first voyage, Sterling was revived by supernatural forces which gave him a second chance.
