40|$|This {{contribution}} aims {{to highlight}} the importance of Social Accounting Matrices (SAMs) {{for the study of}} regional-economic interactions. After a conceptual review <b>of</b> <b>SAMs,</b> the attention is focused on the empirical meaning <b>of</b> <b>SAMs</b> for economic impact assessment. The potential <b>of</b> <b>SAMs</b> is illustrated by an extensive pedagogical treatment of this tool on the basis of several town-hinterland interactions in 5 different European countries. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{techniques}} for creating patterned SAMs {{can be categorized}} into three themes [69, 73]. First is to locally attach SAMs molecules onto desired substrate locations. This scheme includes microcontact printing (μCP) [78, 79], dip-pen nanolithography (DPN) [74, 80], and selective adsorption <b>of</b> specific <b>SAMs</b> molecules onto pre-defined substrate patterns [81, 82]. Second approach is to locally remove SAMs molecules from existing SAMs layer. This includes selective removal <b>of</b> <b>SAMs</b> using UV light [83, 84], STM-induced localized desorption <b>of</b> <b>SAMs</b> [73, 85, 86], and AFM-assisted localized removal <b>of</b> <b>SAMs</b> [73, 74, 77, 87 – 89]. For both themes, the exposed surface area having no SAMs can either be backfilled with other SAMs molecules or left bare. The third approach is to locally modify the terminal group <b>of</b> <b>SAMs</b> molecules, followed by selective functionalization and/or selective attachment of nanoscale building blocks [73, 88, 90 – 95].|$|R

5|$|Although the game's {{development}} {{appeared to}} be proceeding towards completion without difficulty, LucasArts abruptly canceled production of Freelance Police in March 2004, citing economic and market conditions. The game's cancellation was received poorly by fans of the series, Steve Purcell, and the video game industry media. Many journalists viewed this move as a culmination in {{the decline of the}} adventure game genre. LucasArts later terminated its adventure game development, and many of the Freelance Police design team left to create Telltale Games and continue development of such adventure games. Steve Purcell moved the Sam & Max franchise to Telltale Games in 2005, prompting a revival <b>of</b> <b>Sam</b> & Max video games.|$|E

5|$|In February 2009, Telltale Games {{renamed the}} game from its initial release title <b>of</b> <b>Sam</b> & Max: Season One to Sam & Max Save the World. Telltale's public {{relations}} spokeswoman, Emily Morganti, explained that while Season One was thought to communicate the game's episodic nature to potential consumers, the company {{felt that it was}} nondescript in relation to the game's story. The message accompanied the announcement of an Xbox Live Arcade version of the game, which had been subject to media speculation since February 2007. Both Windows and Wii versions of the game are to be republished using the new title.|$|E
5|$|In October 1966, strike force F-105 Thunderchiefs were {{equipped}} with QRC-160 radar jamming pods whose effectiveness virtually ended their losses to surface-to-air missiles. As a result, SAM attacks {{shifted to the}} Phantoms, unprotected because of a shortage of pods. To protect the F-4s, rules of engagement that allowed the MiGCAP to escort the strike force {{in and out of}} the target area were revised in December to restrict MiGCAP penetration to the edge <b>of</b> <b>SAM</b> coverage. MiG interceptions increased as a result, primarily by MiG-21s using high-speed hit-and-run tactics against bomb-laden F-105 formations, and although only two bombers had been lost, the threat to the force was perceived as serious.|$|E
5|$|In {{the small}} town <b>of</b> <b>Sam</b> Dent, British Columbia, a school bus hits a patch of ice, runs through a barrier and crashes into a lake, killing 14 children.

5|$|North Vietnam's {{deployment}} of SAMs forced American pilots to make hard choices: either approach targets at higher altitudes (to avoid anti-aircraft fire) and become prey to SAMs, or fly lower {{to avoid the}} missiles and become the target of anti-aircraft batteries. Due to altered tactics and {{the increased use of}} electronic radar jamming, the record <b>of</b> <b>SAM</b> kills decreased over time. The already dismal missile success rate fell from one kill in 30 launches to less than one kill in 50.|$|E

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the use <b>of</b> self-assembled monolayers (<b>SAMs)</b> for the {{formation}} and characterization of gaseous ions in mass spectrometry (MS). The first part reviews the different results {{reported in the literature}} concerning the use <b>of</b> <b>SAMs</b> for surface induced dissociation (SID) of produced ions into a mass spectrometer. In SID/MS, the ion collision at a given kinetic energy allows the accumulation of internal energy for reaching the activation energy of fragmentation reactions. The different chemical structures <b>of</b> <b>SAMs</b> in SID/MS are described and their influence on the amount of the kinetic energy (Ekin) converted into internal energies (Eint) is reported. The second part is dedicated to the implication <b>of</b> <b>SAMs</b> in the laser desorption–ionization (LDI) methods allowing gas-phase ion formation and highlights the specifications required for the SAMs elaboration in the LDI/MS application field. The matrix-free LDI method is more particularly described. The results obtained with the so-called DIAMS technique (desorption–ionization on self-assembled monolayer surface) are reported and the organization and stability <b>of</b> <b>SAMs</b> are pointed out to obtain reliable results in LDI/MS...|$|R

5|$|During mid-1997, Jackson and Walsh {{began writing}} with Stephen Sinclair. Sinclair's partner, Philippa Boyens, {{was a major}} fan {{of the book and}} joined the writing team after reading their treatment. It took 13–14 months to write the two film scripts, which were 147 and 144 pages respectively. Sinclair left the project due to {{theatrical}} obligations. Amongst their revisions, Sam is caught eavesdropping and forced to go along with Frodo, instead <b>of</b> <b>Sam,</b> Merry, and Pippin figuring out about the One Ring themselves and voluntarily going along after confronting Frodo about it, as occurs in the original novel. Gandalf's account of his time at Orthanc was pulled out of flashback and Lothlórien was cut, with Galadriel doing what she does in the story at Rivendell. Denethor attends the Council with his son. Other changes included having Arwen rescue Frodo, and the action sequence involving the cave troll. The writers also considered having Arwen absorb Éowyn's role entirely by having her kill the Witch-king.|$|E
5|$|Federer's next {{participation}} was in September in the inaugural Laver Cup, representing team Europe.

This {{was the first time}} Federer and Nadal competed {{on the same side of}} a doubles match. On day three, Federer competed in the final match of the tournament, where he sealed victory for Team Europe by defeating Nick Kyrgios in the champion's tiebreak (saving a match point). With three wins and seven points, Federer was the most accomplished player of the tournament.|$|E
5|$|For Alderson {{the battle}} {{had been a}} failure: {{although}} his troops had held, he had found himself {{out of touch with}} the front line and unable to get accurate information about the situation. At one stage he had been commanding 33 battalions across several miles of front line with no central co-ordination and great confusion between his distant headquarters and the trenches. In addition to his personal failings however, the Ross rifles had proven almost useless in battle and some of Alderson's officer corps had performed poorly. In particular Brigadier-General Richard Turner, commander of the 3rd Brigade, and Turner's brigade-major, Colonel Garnet Hughes, the son <b>of</b> <b>Sam</b> Hughes, caused much havoc when on the second day of the battle, they unilaterally withdrew the 3rd Brigade from the front line, opening up a 4,000-yard gap through which the Germans threatened the entire Ypres Salient. Colonel John Carson however, who reported personally to Hughes, downplayed the difficulties and blamed the heavy casualties on Alderson's leadership, indicating that the division had only been saved from annihilation by the actions of Turner and Hughes.|$|E
