We studied two modes of participation in biomass production: an <b>outgrower</b> scheme for sunflower and a jatropha plantation offering full time employment and assessed the four dimensions of food security: availability, access, stability and utilization in smallholder farms in Central Mozambique. We interviewed 80 households who were participating in the sunflower <b>outgrower</b> scheme, had a household member working on the jatropha plantation or were not participating with biofuel production. For each household we quantified four indicators: maize sales minus purchases, gross revenue, revenue diversity, and household dietary diversity scores. Involvement of smallholder farmers with biomass production for fuel had a positive or no impact on the four dimensions of food security at the farm level. Positive food security impacts from working on the biofuel plantation were improvements in availability for the larger farms and improvements in access for the smaller farms.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{development}} of smallholders’ capacity to participate in water governance within their smallholder <b>outgrower</b> schemes in the Zambian sugar industry. Participation in water governance consists of processes that allow stakeholders to exercise “voice and vote”. This allows them to influence and share control of decisions and allocation of resources that affect their water security. Sugarcane is a water intensive crop and therefore water use and water quality are important {{in the management of}} social and environmental risks. Smallholders own small plots of land, rely almost exclusively on family labour, and have limited resources in comparison to commercial farmers and other large scale operators. <b>Outgrower</b> schemes enable smallholders to pool their resources and be more attractive, as outgrowers, to processing firms like Zambia Sugar Plc. Smallholders in <b>outgrower</b> schemes often share water resources. The issue that arises is whether the smallholders within these <b>outgrower</b> schemes are able to participate in the governance of these resources on which their livelihoods depend. Lack of capacity is identified as one of the constraining factors that deter smallholders from participating in water governance. Building smallholders’ capacity can be used to engage them in water governance and promote more responsible and sustainable water use. This study makes a comparison between smallholders from two smallholder <b>outgrower</b> schemes (Kaleya and Manyonyo smallholder <b>outgrower</b> schemes) with different origins, organisational structures, ways of carrying out business, and organisational cultures. Five indicators are used to assess in what context smallholders’ capacity to participate exists: capability to adapt and self-renew, to relate; to balance diversity and coherence, to commit and engage and to carry out technical service and delivery and logistical tasks. The study shows that the context within which smallholders operate greatly affects their capacity to participate. The organisational and management context within which smallholders’ operate can either constrain or enable {{the development of}} their capacity to participate in water governance. A qualitative approach is employed to collect and analyse data. In-depth interviews and documentary analysis are used during field research. Prior to this a literature review of theories relating to participation and capacity development is done. Content analysis of the data collected is made, using themes derived from Baser and Morgan’s (2008) work on capabilities and their contribution to capacity. Although the study is initially focused on capabilities as the most important contributing factors to smallholders’ capacity development, the results point to context as a more significant factor. Context is discussed in relation to the case studies. Suggestions for future research include a more in-depth focus on context and its part in enabling smallholders’ capacity to participate in water governance...|$|E
40|$|African Studies Seminar series. Paper {{presented}} August 1987 Swaziland's Fourth National Development Plan advocates {{the development}} of <b>outgrower</b> schemes based on the example of Vuvulane Irrigated Farms as an alternative strategy for rural development (Swaziland government 1985 : 309). If this recommendation were to be adopted as agricultural policy, it would necessitate land reform in the areas where these schemes are to be established. This {{is because of the}} existing division in land ownership between Swazi Nation Land and freehold Title Deed Land. Swazi Nation Land is held by the King "in trust" for "the nation" and allocated through chiefs to Swazi subjects. Private property in land in Swaziland dates to the concessionary era when large scale concessions were made to European land speculators and prospective farmers {{in the late nineteenth century}} by King Mbandzeni. Contrary to what has been argued in much of the literature on Swaziland, this land division has not entailed {{the development of}} dualism in agriculture, with the "modern" agricultural sector based on freehold title deed land and the "traditional" sector on Swazi Nation Land (SNL). Rather, both the land division and dualism are products of the development of capitalist relations which have generated an uneven and differential development characterised by the evolution of large-scale multinational and South African dominated enterprises on freehold land, and the development of petty commodity production on SNL. One question arising out of the advocation of the development of <b>outgrower</b> schemes and various forms of contract farming in Swaziland relating to land tenure, is whether or not such schemes can be established on SNL. To put it more specifically: is private ownership in land a pre-requisite for the establishment of viable contract farming schemes? This study will show that while freehold land leased out to petty commodity producers is undoubtedly advantageous for the owners of capital, in terms of the extra control which can be exerted over petty commodity producers, this is by no means a pre-requisite for the development of <b>outgrower</b> schemes. While it will be demonstrated that land tenure is not indicative of the form of production which takes place in agriculture, the chief concern of this paper is to examine the extent to which <b>outgrower</b> schemes in Swaziland have succeeded in their stated objectives of bringing "commercial farming" to the peasantry. The key question which emerges is whether or not <b>outgrower</b> schemes facilitate peasant accumulation and create the conditions for the reproduction of a rich and/or middle peasantry. Answers to these questions will be sought through an examination of three <b>outgrower</b> schemes. Two of these, (Vuvulane Irrigated Farms and Mpetsheni Pineapple Settlement Scheme) are on freehold Title Deed Land, while one (Casalee Tobacco Project) is on both freehold and SNL where petty commodity producing participants are based. The paper argues that contract farming and <b>outgrower</b> schemes are best understood in the context of the social relations to which this form of capitalist development in agriculture gives rise. Such schemes have differentiating effects and create the conditions for the reproduction of a middle peasantry, as well as the potential for more systematic accumulation by peasant producers. In Swaziland land tenure both on SNL and freehold title deed land, through restricting the size of land holdings of scheme participants, may have constraining effects on the extent to which accumulation becomes possible for petty commodity producers on such schemes...|$|E

30|$|A {{similar pattern}} emerged for Energy Africa, {{a small company}} in Shimba Hills. In 2009 around 70 farmers were engaged as {{jatropha}} <b>outgrowers</b> (down from an estimated 200 at the project’s peak). At that time the coordinator described jatropha as a cash crop with an unlimited market that farmers could use themselves if prices dropped. By 2013, most of Energy Africa’s activities focused on producing and selling vegetables and herbs, but the coordinator reported that jatropha remained worthwhile as one activity among many for farmers who had stuck with it. The project owned a diesel-operated press and sold jatropha oil to a nearby hotel for use in floating-wick lamps in its restaurant. This niche market allowed the group to generate modest income. In addition to selling jatropha oil, Energy Africa was using jatropha press cake as fertilizer mixed with grass, soil and manure, and some farmers had found that passion fruit plants climb well on jatropha. Jatropha had shrunk in importance relative to other farming activities, but remained viable as a sideline activity thanks {{to the presence of}} a unique local buyer. This project’s spatial location {{played a key role in}} establishing a market for jatropha oil: its proximity to a coastal area with a thriving tourism sector allowed it to link with a hotel that could afford to buy jatropha oil at favourable prices, an opportunity not available in other areas of the country.|$|R
40|$|In this study, two rather {{distinct}} {{forms of}} differentiation are examined, namely class differentiation that {{was associated with}} peasant production (1939 - 1964) and that which manifested itself with the inception of irrigation schemes in the northwestern {{part of the country}} in general and Sanyati in particular in the period 1965 to 2000. The study is, thus, divided into two major parts. Using a case study approach, this work particularly explores and documents {{the extent to which the}} twin processes of development and differentiation took place in Sanyati communal lands in Zimbabwe under both dryland and irrigation conditions from the beginning of the Second World War up to 2000. Research on Tribal Trust Land Development Corporation (TILCOR) or Agricultural and Rural Development Authority (ARDA) schemes in Sanyati (Gowe and the Main Estate) reveals that differentiation as a process has been understudied. This is because of the tendency among scholars and government officials alike to construe ARDA schemes as being devoid of any signs of differentiation (i. e. as homogeneous societal entities) mainly because the plotholders (<b>outgrowers)</b> were allocated standardised or uniform sized plots averaging 3, 5 ha which they farmed on a tenantry basis. However, this study challenges this basic assumption and argues that both dryland and irrigation farming in Sanyati facilitated commercialisation and the development of significant disparities in wealth among rural households. Clear patterns of socio-economic differentiation also emerge despite the proscribing effects of the Native Land Husbandry Act (NLHA) of 1950 and the adoption in the 1960 s of a lease agreement structure by ARDA which in many ways threatened to incapacitate the irrigation plotholders’ advance towards accumulation. The lease agreement was the contract <b>outgrowers</b> entered into in order to have the right to use government allocated plots for a specified period of time (i. e. 99 -year leases) at all ARDA irrigation schemes in Zimbabwe. Although such state interventionist measures threatened to arrest rural differentiation, the study argues that Sanyati peasants still had abundant initiative to blunt both the colonial and post- colonial states’ offensive. Irrigation has been perceived in state policy circles primarily as a least cost means offamine relief and as a means of settling displaced farmers from Crown Land (government owned land) in the colonial period and other types of land categories after independence. This implies that the government developed schemes in the communal areas mainly on the strength of their social desirability alone. However, this study challenges scholarship which conceives the problem of rural development as no more than moving the rural population from a subsistence economy to a cash economy. It argues that such schemesas Gowe, on the basis of cotton commodity production, at different stages in the period under review have transcended the social desirability objective and become a source of affluence and economic progress for some innovative and commercially oriented rural farmers. Indeed, the study demonstrates that the introduction of both cotton and irrigation in the 1960 s deepened socio-economic inequalities among the plotholding households and dryland farming households in Sanyati. The important questions the study will answer are: What was the state of the peasant economy (based on dryland farming) in Sanyati prior to irrigation? How far did peasant differentiation emerge in Sanyati prior to irrigation enterprise? Did irrigation facilitate increased production of cotton and other crops as well as increased access to wealth/income? To what extent did irrigation agriculture lead to the emergence of rural differentiation in the region? Did the state (both colonial and post-colonial) promote rural differentiation? Thus, the study evaluates peasant (especially dryland) agriculture from 1939 and irrigation farming from the 1960 s and analyses how the relationship between ARDASanyati and Gowe has developed since the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) up to 2000. At the same time, elements of continuity or change in the interaction of the two are addressed within the context of the colonial and post-colonial paradigms in order to demonstrate how Sanyati society was differentiated in the two major periods under review.

40|$|Seventy-five {{percent of}} the world’s poor live in rural areas with a vast {{majority}} depending on agriculture. But all too often access to land is problematic and {{the legal status of}} land rights, especially of smallholder farmers, is unclear. Land reforms are therefore high on the international development agenda. However, empirical evidence is mixed, and some aspects, such as the effects of voluntary resettlement, are highly under-researched. My dissertation therefore aims at contributing to the identification of consequences of voluntary resettlement. Thereby, I was guided by three central questions: 1. Did voluntary resettlement within a land reform affect social networks in the short run? 2. Do the land reform beneficiaries face the danger of a risk-induced poverty trap and does this threat differ between resettled and non-resettled participants? 3. How does the land distribution and initial agricultural success affect subjective economic well-being of the beneficiaries? The data collection took place within a land reform project in Cambodia where so called social land concessions are granted to landless or land-poor households. Beneficiaries could apply for agricultural land, settlement land, or both types of land. This enabled me to compare those who received only agricultural land (non-resettled households) with those who received agricultural and settlement land (resettled households). The research is based on a data set consisting of ex-ante survey data on the socio-economic situation of future land recipients and an appropriate control group, ex-post survey data of the same households collected about one and a half year after the intervention, and ex-post experimental data of the land recipients dealing with risk-taking and the willingness to show solidarity with anonymous village members. This dissertation shows that the willingness to support fellow villagers is significantly lower in the resettled community than in the non-resettled communities. Resettled land recipients transfer on average between 47 and 75 percent less money than non-resettled players. Hence, the social costs of voluntary resettlement seem to be significantly higher than commonly assumed. In line with this finding, solidarity expectations are lower for resettled than for non-resettled land recipients. As expectations are in turn positively related to risk-taking and the reaction to past success is stronger in the non-resettled community, I can show that the danger of path-dependency and a risk-induced poverty trap exists for all land recipients but that it seems to be higher for resettled project members. As a complementary to these objective approaches, I analyze subjective economic well-being of the land recipients and a control group. I find that it is positively correlated with land size. This outcome does not only originate from monetary effects, as identified correlations remain significant after controlling for income. For that reason, it is likely that not only today’s income but also improved future economic prospects and increased economic stability play an important role for subjective economic well-being of land recipients. Moreover, those respondents who manage to put the received land under agricultural production show a higher subjective economic well-being indicating that success matters for farmers’ well-being. This dissertation adds furthermore to the scarce evidence on causal effects of contract farming in the sphere of a large-scale land acquisition. Recently, large-scale land acquisition has increased dramatically in the developing world. The question how land deals affect the local population became therefore highly relevant. Despite controversial findings in the literature, studies identifying the causal effect of contract farming on farmers’ circumstances are rare and often rely on weak instruments. The fourth paper of this dissertation made use of a unique dataset incorporating information on <b>outgrowers</b> and independent farmers {{in the context of a}} large-scale land acquisition in Ghana where contract allocation took place as a quasi-natural experiment. The analysis was guided by the following question: 4. Does contract farming contribute to the overall subjective well-being of participating farmers? We identify a positive effect of contract farming on subjective well-being. It seems that contract farming increases security of the participating farmers as secure rights to land matter substantially for the overall life satisfaction of non-contract but not of contract farmers...|$|R
40|$|Having {{appreciated}} {{the changes in}} global markets that offer lucrative opportunities for highvalue crops like baby vegetables; the dire need to diversify the Swaziland agricultural sector; and the versatility of value chain finance, this study takes the Swaziland baby vegetable industry {{as a case study}} to determine the applicability of value chain finance to infant highvalue horticultural industries lacking guaranteed markets. This study focused on the NAMBoard value chain, employing both qualitative and quantitative methods of inquiry through a desktop study; case study reviews; and in-depth interviews. This study adapted the UNIDO (2011) VCF analytical framework. This study found that NAMBoard provides direct VCF to its producers, financial institutions provide formal finance, farmer group members provide informal finance to each other, farmers that have some other sources of income self-finance the baby vegetable enterprise, and that there is inter-financing between the baby vegetable and conventional vegetable value chains. Indirect VCF is absent in this value chain. On the other hand, Sdemane enterprise provides direct VCF to its <b>outgrowers</b> and data collectedEmpirical evidence on a sample constituting about 30 % of the target population shows that seeds/seedling costs contribute 56. 1 % to total average production costs. This shows a big financing challenge now that NAMBoard is reluctant to give seeds on credit, while the rest of v the 43. 9 % still require financing. In addition to that, there is no capital finance loans provided to smallholder producer, but only operational finance is accessible from formal financial institutions. This study discovered that all baby vegetable producers also produce conventional vegetables, and these businesses are inter-linked. There is financing between the baby vegetable and conventional vegetable businesses and thus value chains, sourced from product proceeds. Individual producers, farmer groups and farmer associations form the producer base. A financial analysis on the production stage revealed that that there are informal financial relationships within farmer groups. Also, farmer groups use formal finance suggests that these don’t use other financing mechanisms except self-finance VCF.

A financial analysis on the production stage revealed that that there are informal financial relationships within farmer groups. Also, farmer groups use formal finance more than individual producers who mostly prefer self-finance VCF. A VCF analysis of NAMBoard discovered that there is direct VCF between the SAS input shop and also the NAMBoard input shop, and between producers and the NAMBoard input shop. NAMBoard, in addition to the input shop and provision of extension services, performs three distinct post-harvest services namely: transportation; processing; and marketing, for which a handling fee of 35 percent to the final produce value is charged and deducted from product proceeds. The Swaziland financial system has no financial products specifically for this industry, as there is a very small number of participants borrowing funds from financial institutions. The loan processing procedures are cumbersome and take too long thus formal finance is currently ill suited to producers. This study rated the risks to the financial transaction reflecting the qualitative interpretation of available information and that obtained in the field through interview schedules with all value chain actors. Risks identified as high are: insufficient production; poor quality produce; failure to meet food quality ands safety standards; lack of guaranteed market; and ignorance on price. Catastrophic weather; loss of quality; lack of technical know-how; and failure to manage business profitably were categorised as medium risk. Inefficiency; lack of market demand; and unreliable water sources & electricity are seen as low risk to the financial transaction. This study also explored the Sdemane value chain, where Sdemane enterprise is the lead firm. It was examined and interpreted as an institutional success story that holds the solution to the NAMBoard value chain ailments. It also has out grower producers to supplement its production. Findings of this research show that a financial bailout ensured the survival and growth of this emerging value chain, which now has secured markets with a market demand more than achieved output. The model used is able to minimise and diversify risk for both Sdemane and the out grower producers. The manner in which this value chain is organised makes it competitive and exhibits potential which attracted donor funding, and today is an infant value chain that is achieving tremendous growth. This study concludes that VCF is applicable to infant industries lacking guaranteed markets to a limited extent. Minimising risk increases the availability of finance due to the resultant increase in financial attractiveness and the chain becomes able to produce competitively and meet the strict market conditions. At the end, the value chain would operate as if the market were guaranteed, just by being competitive and successfully delivering products to end markets. With regard to policy, rethinking the underlying NAMBoard business model and learning from success stories including the local Sdemane enterprise is one way to avoid the imminent collapse in exports from this value chain.

40|$|Large-scale land {{acquisition}} {{has increased dramatically}} in recent years. The question whether land deals can benefit both the local population and the investor is therefore high on the international agenda. Contract farming is discussed as a possible solution but studies identifying the causal effects are rare. Using data from a quasi-natural experiment in contract allocation, we compare the subjective well-being of outgrowers and independent farmers {{in the sphere of}} the biggest palm oil producer in Ghana. We identify a positive causal effect of the <b>outgrower</b> scheme which increases subjective well-being by 1. 5 points on a scale of 0 to 10. We find a substitutive relationship between having an <b>outgrower</b> contract and having property rights, and thus we argue that by increasing security a contract increases well-being, as secure rights to land matter substantially for the overall life satisfaction of non-contract but not of contract farmers...|$|E
