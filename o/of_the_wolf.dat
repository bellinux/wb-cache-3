Dire wolf remains having the youngest geological ages are dated at 9,440YBP at Brynjulfson Cave, Boone County, Missouri, 9,860YBP at Rancho La Brea, California, and 10,690YBP at La Mirada, California. Dire wolf remains have been radiocarbon dated to 8,200YBP from Whitewater Draw in Arizona, However, one author has stated that radiocarbon dating of bone carbonate {{is known to be}} unreliable, and that while many dire wolf remains are found in fossil assemblages dated to the terminal Pleistocene, there are no confirmed Holocene finds.|$|E

5|$|One day at harvest time, {{according}} to William of Newburgh {{during the reign}} of King Stephen (1135–1154), the villagers of Woolpit discovered two children, a brother and sister, beside one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wolf</b> pits that gave the village its name. Their skin was green, they spoke an unknown language, and their clothing was unfamiliar. Ralph reports that the children were taken to the home of Richard de Calne. Ralph and William agree that the pair refused all food for several days until they came across some raw broad beans, which they consumed eagerly. The children gradually adapted to normal food and in time lost their green colour. The boy, who appeared to be the younger of the two, became sickly and died shortly after he and his sister were baptised.|$|E
5|$|Postglacial {{environmental}} change throughout eastern Beringia brought about wholesale changes in vegetation, the regional extinction {{of much of}} the megafauna, and the entrance of Homo sapiens. The large Late Pleistocene carnivores that were more carnivorous than their competitors faced greater vulnerability to extinction. The Beringian cave lion, saber-toothed cat, and short-faced bear went extinct {{at the same time as}} their large megafaunal prey. The omnivorous coyote, American black bear, brown bear, puma and bobcat survived. Both the Beringian wolf and the dire wolf went extinct in North America, leaving only the less carnivorous and more gracile form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wolf</b> to thrive. One extinction theory holds that the Beringian wolf was outcompeted and replaced by the ancestor of the modern gray wolf.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the near}} {{extermination}} of wolves and cougars, the coyote was most numerous in grasslands inhabited by bison, pronghorn, elk, and other deer, doing particularly well in short-grass areas with prairie dogs, {{though it was}} just as much at home in semiarid areas with sagebrush and jackrabbits or in deserts inhabited by cactus, kangaroo rats, and rattlesnakes. As long as it was not in direct competition with the wolf, the coyote ranged from the Sonoran Desert to the alpine regions of adjoining mountains or the plains and mountainous areas of Alberta. With the extermination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wolf,</b> the coyote's range expanded to encompass broken forests from the tropics of Guatemala and the northern slope of Alaska.|$|E
50|$|Circa 400 CE, {{a massive}} seismic {{event in the}} Ellendale Fault (part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Madrid Fault system) raised a low ridge across present-day east Memphis, {{diverting}} Nonconnah Creek away from <b>the</b> <b>Wolf,</b> causing it to flow directly into the Mississippi River several miles south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wolf's</b> mouth. <b>The</b> lowermost section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nonconnah that continued to flow into <b>the</b> <b>Wolf</b> eventually became known as Cypress Creek.|$|R
50|$|A study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{mitochondrial}} DNA <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> {{living in}} <b>the</b> Trans-Himalaya region have unique haplotypes, do not cluster phylogenetically with other gray wolves, were basal {{to all other}} wolves and are closer to the jackal. This indicates that these are <b>the</b> descendants <b>of</b> an ancient wolf distribution and a new taxonomic classification of Canis himalayensis is proposed. Later studies of mitochondrial DNA and other DNA sequences found that <b>the</b> Himalayan <b>wolf</b> formed a basal distinct monophyletic clade relative to <b>the</b> holarctic gray <b>wolf.</b> Its degree <b>of</b> divergence to <b>the</b> holarctic gray <b>wolf</b> is similar to <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> divergence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> African golden <b>wolf</b> from <b>the</b> holarctic gray <b>wolf.</b> <b>The</b> Himalayan <b>wolf</b> possesses a unique X-chromosome haplotype but shares a Y-chromosome haplotype with <b>the</b> African golden <b>wolf.</b> <b>The</b> range <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Himalayan <b>wolf</b> includes <b>the</b> Himalayas then north across the Tibetan plateau to the Qinghai Lake in Qinghai Province, China.|$|R

5|$|The Menominee sued in the U.S. Court of Claims {{to recover}} {{compensation}} {{for the loss of}} their hunting and fishing rights. The Court of Claims first clarified that the Menominee Termination Act did not abolish the tribe or its membership, but merely ended federal supervision of the tribe. Since the Menominee was still a tribe, although not one under federal trusteeship, the tribe had a right to assert a claim arising out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wolf</b> River Treaty in accordance with the Indian Claims Commission Act and the Tucker Act.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wolf</b> {{occurred over}} a geologic time scale of 800,000 years, transforming the first Middle Pleistocene wolf specimen that {{is recognized as}} being morphologically similar to Canis lupus into today's dog, dingo, and gray wolf. Ecological factors including habitat type, climate, prey specialization and predatory competition will greatly influence the wolf's genetic population structure and cranio-dental plasticity. Wolves went through a population bottleneck 20,000 years before present (YBP), which indicates that many wolf populations had gone extinct {{at a time that}} coincided with the Last Glacial Maximum and the expansion of modern humans worldwide with their technology for capturing large game. The domestic dog is the most widely abundant large carnivore, and a descendant of one of those now-extinct wolf populations.|$|E

30|$|In <b>the</b> early stage, <b>wolves</b> tend {{to search}} globally, so <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> should explore more unknown areas. If <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> in <b>the</b> region are denser in this area, each <b>wolf</b> in <b>the</b> region is well-adapted, {{and it can}} be {{inclined}} to select some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poorly adapted <b>wolves</b> among <b>the</b> pack to search in other regions. Because <b>wolves</b> in <b>the</b> area are searching, they can avoid falling into a local optimum. In the later stage, the tendency is to search carefully to find better prey. Therefore, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> can be concentrated in a certain area for a detailed search.

5|$|Local {{influences}} {{have also}} been a strong part of Scouting. By adopting and modifying local ideologies, Scouting {{has been able to}} find acceptance {{in a wide variety of}} cultures. In the United States, Scouting uses images drawn from the U.S. frontier experience. This includes not only its selection of animal badges for Cub Scouts, but the underlying assumption that American native peoples are more closely connected with nature and therefore have special wilderness survival skills which can be used as part of the training program. By contrast, British Scouting makes use of imagery drawn from the Indian subcontinent, because that region was a significant focus in the early years of Scouting. Baden-Powell's personal experiences in India led him to adopt Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book as a major influence for the Cub Scouts; for example, the name used for the Cub Scout leader, Akela (whose name was also appropriated for the Webelos), is that of the leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wolf</b> pack in the book.|$|E
5|$|Marta, a black gray wolf, is alpha {{female in}} a small pack in Pleasant Valley, Montana, that {{consists}} of her mate, Calef, their three pups Rann, Sula, and Annie, and a seven-year-old wolf named Oldtooth. One morning Calef is killed by poachers, leaving Marta and Oldtooth to try to feed and raise the pups on their own. Though an experienced hunter, Oldtooth is unable to bring down large game as he lost most of his teeth chewing a steel leg trap off his leg years ago. Once the cubs {{are old enough to}} be left alone for short periods of time, Marta takes over the bulk of the hunting. Though it is difficult, the two adults successfully keep all three cubs alive and begin weaning them and teaching them the ways <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wolf.</b> In the summer, traps begin appearing in the area as human populations increase. Annie and Sula are caught and are taken away by humans, but reappear a few days later, locked in cages. Marta tries to free her pups but is unsuccessful; however humans come regularly to keep them fed and ensure they have water. Oldtooth is later captured, while Marta is tranquilized from a helicopter. Rann escapes and is not seen again.|$|E
5|$|The Tales series {{originated}} when Phantasia began production, {{based on}} an unpublished novel titled , written by the game's scenario writer and lead programmer Yoshiharu Gotanda. During the story development process, several elements of the original novel were dropped or changed. The game was developed by Wolf Team, an independent game development studio founded in 1986. Due to bad experiences at Telenet Japan, the previous employer of multiple Wolf Team members, the staff sought an independent publisher for the game. After an unsuccessful pitch to Enix, they entered a publishing contract with Bandai Namco (then Namco). Phantasia had a troubled development cycle for the original Super Famicom version, with many creative disagreements between Wolf Team and Namco. The disagreements led to most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wolf</b> Team staff leaving after the game in order {{to start a new}} company, tri-Ace, which would go on to make the Star Ocean series.
