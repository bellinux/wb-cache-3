40|$|Cucurbit yellow {{stunting}} disorder virus (CYSDV) is {{a relatively}} new virus affecting cantaloupe production in South Texas and worldwide. No resistant commercial cultivars are available. A cross of ?Dulce? (susceptible) x ?TGR 1551 ? (resistant) was made and populations were developed for screening. Although no complete resistance was recovered, ?TGR 1551 ? showed some tolerance and may be useful in breeding efforts. Sugar components such as sucrose, fructose, glucose, and total soluble solids are major factors in determining mature melon fruit sweetness, and Vitamin C is important for human health. A F 2 population was developed from the melon cross ?Dulce? (high values) x ?TGR 1551 ? (low values) and bulked segregant analysis was used to detect random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers associated with quantitative trait loci (QTL) for each trait. Out of 500 primers, fifteen RAPD markers were found to be significantly associated with fruit quality QTL. These markers could be useful in a marker assisted selection program to transfer these genes into a low quality cultivar or breeding line to enhance fruit quality.

The present investigation {{was carried out}} in Mashhad, Iran, to study the effect of weeds, which emerged naturally in a multi species community along side with melon, on quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the crop during 2007. Thirty five plots were selected randomly in a girded filed. Weeds were allowed to compete freely with melon by the harvest time in 32 plots. The other 3 plots were weeded during crop development. Weed sampling was conducted prior to melon harvesting. Density, frequency and dry mater were recorded species-wise. Maximum melon plant growth and yield indices were also recorded. Stepwise multivariate regression equations were established to determine the competitive relation between population and dry matter of each weed species and melon characteristics. Results revealed that dry matter had more significant relation with characteristics under study compare to weed density. Weeds showed two adverse competitive responses. According to their effects on melon traits, weeds were divided in antagonistic and synergistic groups.

40|$|Compared to <b>other</b> <b>melon</b> types, Cantaloupe Charentais melons {{are highly}} {{aromatic}} {{with a major}} contribution to the aroma being made by aliphatic and branched esters. Using a transgenic line in which the synthesis of the plant hormone ethylene has been considerably lowered by antisense ACC oxidase mRNA (AS), the aliphatic ester pathway steps at which ethylene exerts its regulatory role were found. The data show that the production of aliphatic esters such as hexyl and butyl acetate was blocked in AS fruit and could be reversed by ethylene. Using fruit discs incubated {{in the presence of}} various precursors, the steps at which ester formation was inhibited in AS fruit was shown to be the reduction of fatty acids and aldehydes, the last step of acetyl transfer to alcohols being unaffected. However, treating AS fruit with the ethylene antagonist 1 -methylcyclopropene resulted in about 50 % inhibition of acetyl transfer activity, indicating that this portion of activity was ethylene-dependent and this was supported by the low residual ethylene concentration of AS fruit discs (around 2 µl l- 1). In conclusion, the reduction of fatty acids and aldehydes appears essentially to be ethylene-dependent, whilst the last step of alcohol acetylation has ethylene-dependent and ethylene-independent components, probably corresponding to differentially regulated alcohol acetyltransferases...|$|R

40|$|For the {{breeding}} of Japanese netted melon, {{various types of}} foreign cultivars have been utilized for improving adaptability, disease and pest resistance, fruit quality and so on. However, {{little is known about}} their genetic diversity and relationships, since most cultivars derived from crosses between various horticultural groups. To figure out the genetic structure of Japanese melon, in this study, 57 melon accessions from three horticultural groups were examined using 55 RAPD markers produced by 24 RAPD primers. Genetic diversity of the Japanese netted melon was as high as those of cultivar groups of Groups Cantalupensis and Inodorus, while it was low in Group Conomon irrespective of large variations in fruit traits. Cluster analysis and PCO analysis based on genetic distance showed that Group Conomon was distantly related to <b>other</b> <b>melon</b> accessions. Among the latter, European cantaloupe (nonnetted) and American open-field type (netted) proved to be genetically close, while England glasshouse melon (netted) including ‘Earl’s Favourite’ is distantly related to these two groups and closely related with Group Inodorus. It was therefore suggested that England glasshouse type was established from hybrids between European cantaloupe and Group Inodorus. Japanese netted melon was most closely related with England glasshouse type, irrespective of the fact that various kinds of melon accessions have been crossed to improve adaptability, disease resistance and so on. In contrast, pure line cultivars of the Japanese netted melon bred by pure line selection from ‘Earl's Favourite’ or by crossing ‘Earl’s Favourite’ with ‘British Queen’ were confirmed to be mostly homogenous, and it was difficult to establish RAPD markers to discriminate each cultivar.

40|$|The genetic {{diversity}} of five winter melon landraces having a historic {{presence in the}} town of Villaconejos, Spain (near Madrid) and four reference accessions including one accession from snakemelon, was assessed using the allelic variation at 19 SSR loci. Seventy-two polymorphic bands were scored which provided for adequate discrimination among the accessions examined. Cluster analysis (UPGMA) employing SSR-based genetic similarity (GS, Jaccard similarity coefficient) data resulted in a dendrogram with two major clades. Although winter melon accessions were represented in both clades, genetic differences among two Madrid accessions and the other seven landraces were remarkable. In fact, this genetic difference (GS = 0. 24; lack of genetic affinity) was lower than the difference between the accession C- 444 and the <b>other</b> winter <b>melon</b> landraces accessions examined (GS = 0. 25).

40|$|Abstract Background Changes in {{the copy}} number of DNA {{sequences}} {{are one of}} the main mechanisms generating genome variability in eukaryotes. These changes are often related to phenotypic effects such as genetic disorders or novel pathogen resistance. The increasing availability of genome sequences through the application of next-generation massive sequencing technologies has allowed the study of genomic polymorphisms at both the interspecific and intraspecific levels, thus helping to understand how species adapt to changing environments through genome variability. Results Data on gene presence/absence variation (PAV) in melon was obtained by resequencing a cultivated accession and an old-relative melon variety, and using previously obtained resequencing data from three <b>other</b> <b>melon</b> cultivars, among them DHL 92, on which the current draft melon genome sequence is based. A total of 1, 697 PAV events were detected, involving 4. 4 % of the predicted melon gene complement. In all, an average 1. 5 % of genes were absent from each analyzed cultivar as compared to the DHL 92 reference genome. The most populated functional category among the 304 PAV genes of known function was that of stress response proteins (30 % of all classified PAVs). Our results suggest that genes from multi-copy families are five {{times more likely to be}} affected by PAV than singleton genes. Also, the chance of genes present in the genome in tandem arrays being affected by PAV is double that of isolated genes, with PAV genes tending to be in longer clusters. The highest concentration of PAV events detected in the melon genome was found in a 1. 1  Mb region of linkage group V, which also shows the highest density of melon stress-response genes. In particular, this region contains the longest continuous gene-containing PAV sequence so far identified in melon. Conclusions The first genome-wide report of PAV variation among several melon cultivars is presented here. Multi-copy and clustered genes, especially those with putative stress-response functions, were found to be particularly affected by PAV polymorphisms. As cucurbits are known to possess a significantly lower number of defense-related genes compared to other plant species, PAV variation may play an important role in generating new pathogen resistances at the subspecies level. In addition, these results show the limitations of single reference genome sequences as the only basis for characterization and cloning of resistance genes.
