5|$|Iridium has two {{naturally}} occurring, stable isotopes, 191Ir and 193Ir, {{with natural}} abundances of 37.3% and 62.7%, respectively. At least 34 radioisotopes {{have also been}} synthesized, ranging in mass number from 164 to 199. 192Ir, which falls between the two stable isotopes, is the most stable radioisotope, with a half-life of 73.827days, and finds application in brachytherapy and in industrial radiography, particularly for nondestructive testing of welds in steel in {{the oil and gas}} industries; iridium-192 sources have been involved in a number of radiological accidents. Three other isotopes have half-lives <b>of</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> day—188Ir, 189Ir, and 190Ir. Isotopes with masses below 191 decay by some combination of β+ decay, α decay, and (rare) proton emission, with the exceptions of 189Ir, which decays by electron capture. Synthetic isotopes heavier than 191 decay by β− decay, although 192Ir also has a minor electron capture decay path. All known isotopes of iridium were discovered between 1934 and 2001; the most recent is 171Ir.|$|E

25|$|Psychopathy is a {{personality}} disorder which has symptoms expressed {{over a wide}} range of settings. Socially, it expresses extensive callous and manipulative self-serving behaviors with no regard for others, and often is associated with repeated delinquency, crime and violence, but may also present itself in other, maybe even successful social settings. Mentally, impairments in processes related to affect (emotion) and cognition, particularly socially related mental processes, have been found in those with the disorder which suggest that their destructive social behavior is borne from these aberrant mental processes. Developmentally, symptoms of psychopathy have been identified in young children with conduct disorder, and is suggestive <b>of</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> partial constitutional factor that influences its development.|$|E

In either of these cases if not previously favoured by {{the circumstances of the}} general battle about to take place, such a marked accession to his strength would enable him to assume the offensive; whilst, in the first mentioned, Wellington would effectually prevent a junction between Napoleon's and Ney's forces.|$|E
