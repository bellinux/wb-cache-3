5|$|The North American river <b>otter</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by German naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1777. The mammal {{was identified as}} a species of <b>otter</b> and has a variety of common names, including North American river <b>otter,</b> northern river <b>otter,</b> common <b>otter</b> and, simply, river <b>otter.</b> Other documented common names are American <b>otter,</b> Canada <b>otter,</b> Canadian <b>otter,</b> fish <b>otter,</b> land <b>otter,</b> nearctic river <b>otter,</b> and Prince of Wales <b>otter.</b>|$|E
5|$|An extinct genus, Satherium, is {{believed}} to be ancestral to the present species, having migrated to the New World during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene. The giant <b>otter</b> shares the South American continent with three of the four members of the New World Lontra genus of otters: the neotropical river <b>otter,</b> the southern river <b>otter,</b> and the marine <b>otter.</b> (The North American river <b>otter</b> (Lontra canadensis) is the fourth Lontra member.) The giant <b>otter</b> seems to have evolved independently of Lontra in South America, despite the overlap. The smooth-coated <b>otter</b> (Lutrogale perspicillata) of Asia may be its closest extant relative; similar behaviour, vocalizations, and skull morphology have been noted. Both species also show strong pair bonding and paternal engagement in rearing cubs.|$|E
5|$|Even if without direct predation, {{the giant}} <b>otter</b> must still {{compete with other}} predators for food resources. Duplaix {{documented}} interaction with the neotropical <b>otter.</b> While the two species are sympatric (with overlapping ranges) during certain seasons, {{there appeared to be}} no serious conflict. The smaller neotropical <b>otter</b> is far more shy, less noisy, and less social; at about a third the weight of the giant <b>otter,</b> it is more vulnerable to predation, hence, a lack of conspicuousness is to its advantage. The neotropical <b>otter</b> is active during twilight and darkness, reducing the likelihood of conflict with the diurnal giant <b>otter.</b> Its smaller prey, different denning habits, and different preferred water types also reduce interaction.|$|E

5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates the sea <b>otter</b> (Enhydra) lineage became {{isolated in the}} North Pacific approximately two mya, giving rise to the now-extinct †Enhydra macrodonta and the modern sea <b>otter,</b> Enhydra lutris. The sea <b>otter</b> evolved initially in northern Hokkaidō and Russia, and then spread east to the Aleutian Islands, mainland Alaska, and down the North American coast. In comparison to cetaceans, sirenians, and pinnipeds, which entered the water approximately 50, 40, and 20 mya, respectively, the sea <b>otter</b> is a relative newcomer to marine life. In some respects though, the sea <b>otter</b> is more fully adapted to water than pinnipeds, which must haul out on land or ice to give birth.|$|E
5|$|Among the Ainu, the <b>otter</b> {{is portrayed}} as an {{occasional}} messenger between humans and the creator. The sea <b>otter</b> is a recurring figure in Ainu folklore. A major Ainu epic, the Kutune Shirka, tells the tale of wars and struggles over a golden sea <b>otter.</b> Versions of a widespread Aleut legend tell of lovers or despairing women who plunge into the sea and become otters. These links {{have been associated with}} the many human-like behavioral features of the sea <b>otter,</b> including apparent playfulness, strong mother-pup bonds and tool use, yielding to ready anthropomorphism. The beginning of commercial exploitation had a great impact on the human, as well as animal, populations the Ainu and Aleuts have been displaced or their numbers are dwindling, while the coastal tribes of North America, where the <b>otter</b> is in any case greatly depleted, no longer rely as intimately on sea mammals for survival.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, {{improvements}} in natural resource management techniques emerged, along with increased concerns about <b>otter</b> population declines in North America. Consequently, many wildlife management agencies developed strategies to restore or enhance <b>otter</b> populations, {{including the use}} of reintroduction projects. Since 1976, over 4,000 otters have been reintroduced in 21 U.S. states. All Canadian provinces except Prince Edward Island and 29 U.S. states have viable populations that sustain annual harvests. Annual harvest numbers of northern river otters are similar for Canada and the United States, with most pelts being used in the garment industry. In the late 1970s, annual harvest in North America reached approximately 50,000 pelts, for a value of US$3 million. Otters are inadvertently harvested by traps set for beavers, and therefore management plans should consider both species simultaneously. While current harvest strategies do not pose a threat to maintaining <b>otter</b> populations, harvest may limit expansion of <b>otter</b> populations in some areas. <b>Otter</b> harvests correlate positively with the beaver harvests and with the average beaver pelt price from the preceding year. Fur of the river <b>otter</b> is thick and lustrous and is the most durable of Native American furs. River <b>otter</b> pelts are used as the standard for rating the quality of other pelts.|$|E

However, biologists have confirmed isolated sightings of sea <b>otters</b> in these areas since the mid-1990s.|$|R

5|$|For many {{maritime}} indigenous cultures {{throughout the}} North Pacific, especially the Ainu in the Kuril Islands, the Koryaks and Itelmen of Kamchatka, the Aleut in the Aleutian Islands, the Haida of Haida Gwaii {{and a host}} of tribes on the Pacific coast of North America, the sea <b>otter</b> has played an important role as a cultural, as well as material, resource. In these cultures, many of which have strongly animist traditions full of legends and stories in which many aspects of the natural world are associated with spirits, the sea <b>otter</b> was considered particularly kin to humans. The Nuu-chah-nulth, Haida, and other First Nations of coastal British Columbia used the warm and luxurious pelts as chiefs' regalia. Sea <b>otter</b> pelts were given in potlatches to mark coming-of-age ceremonies, weddings, and funerals. The Aleuts carved sea <b>otter</b> bones for use as ornaments and in games, and used powdered sea <b>otter</b> baculum as a medicine for fever.|$|E

5|$|River <b>otters</b> often {{reside in}} beaver ponds. Encounters between <b>otters</b> and beavers are not {{necessarily}} hostile. In Idaho, <b>otters</b> and beavers were recorded in the same beaver lodge simultaneously on three separate occasions. The <b>otters</b> may compete with the American mink (Mustela vison) for resources. In Alaska, the two species living in marine environments indicate niche separation through resource partitioning, probably related to the swimming abilities of these mustelids.|$|R

5|$|More recently, habitat {{destruction}} and degradation {{have become the}} principal dangers, and a further reduction of 50% is expected in giant <b>otter</b> numbers within the 20 years after 2004 (about the span of three generations of giant otters). Typically, loggers first move into rainforest, clearing the vegetation along riverbanks. Farmers follow, creating depleted soil and disrupted habitats. As human activity expands, giant <b>otter</b> home ranges become increasingly isolated. Subadults leaving in search of new territory find it impossible to set up family groups. Specific threats from human industry include unsustainable mahogany logging {{in parts of the}} giant <b>otter</b> range, and concentrations of mercury in its diet of fish, a byproduct of gold mining. Water pollution from mining, fossil fuel extraction, and agriculture is a serious danger; concentrations of pesticides and other chemicals are magnified at each step in the food chain, and can poison top predators such as the giant <b>otter.</b>|$|E
5|$|Oil spills {{present a}} {{localized}} threat to <b>otter</b> populations, especially in coastal areas. Water pollution and other diminution of aquatic and wetland habitats may limit distribution and pose long-term threats if {{the enforcement of}} water quality standards is not upheld. Acid drainage from coal mines is a persistent water quality issue in some areas, as it eliminates <b>otter</b> prey. This dilemma prevents, and consequently inhibits, recolonization or growth of <b>otter</b> populations. Recently, long-term genetic consequences of reintroduction projects on remnant <b>otter</b> populations has been discussed. Similarly, many perceived threats to otters, such as pollution and habitat alterations, have not been rigorously evaluated. Little effort has gone into assessing the threat of disease to wild river <b>otter</b> populations, so it is poorly understood and documented. River otters may be victims of canine distemper, rabies, respiratory tract disease, and urinary infection. In addition, North American river otters can contract jaundice, hepatitis, feline panleucopenia, and pneumonia. They host numerous endoparasites, such as nematodes, cestodes, trematodes, the sporozoan Isopora, and acanthocephalans. Ectoparasites include ticks, sucking lice(Latagophthirus rauschi), and fleas (Oropsylla arctomys).|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} by Koepfli and Wayne in 1998 found the giant <b>otter</b> {{has the highest}} divergence sequences within the <b>otter</b> subfamily, forming a distinct clade that split away 10 to 14 million years ago. They noted that the species may be the basal divergence among the otters or fall outside of them altogether, having split even before other mustelids, such as the ermine, polecat, and mink. Later gene sequencing research on the mustelids, from 2005, places the divergence of the giant <b>otter</b> somewhat later, between five and 11 million years ago; the corresponding phylogenetic tree locates the Lontra divergence first among <b>otter</b> genera, and Pteronura second, although divergence ranges overlap.|$|E
50|$|In 1911, {{when only}} one {{small group of}} 32 sea <b>otters</b> survived in a remote cove, an {{international}} treaty was signed to prevent further exploitation of the sea <b>otters.</b> Under heavy protection, the <b>otters</b> multiplied and repopulated the depleted areas, which slowly recovered. More recently, with declining numbers of fish stocks, again due to overexploitation, killer whales have experienced a food shortage and have been observed feeding on sea <b>otters,</b> again reducing their numbers.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decades <b>otters</b> became rather rare in The Netherlands. Consequently, during the last years only a few <b>otters</b> that were found dead became {{available}} for scientific examination. Recently, the chemical department of the Research Institute for Nature Management analyzed liver and kidney tissue of three <b>otters.</b> In two of them, PCB levels exceeded the level known to cause reproductive failure in Mink; these <b>otters</b> {{did not come from}} industrialised areas...|$|R
40|$|Variation in {{terrestrial}} mammalian craniodental morphology and skull {{shape is}} known to constrain feeding performance, which in turn influences dietary habits and ultimately fitness. <b>Otters</b> have evolved two feeding specializations: underwater raptorial capture of prey (mouth-oriented) and capture of prey by hand (hand-oriented), which likely correspond to craniodental morphology and bite performance. However, feeding biomechanics and performance data for <b>otters,</b> aquatic mustelids that consume prey above water, are sparse. The first goal {{of the study was}} to investigate the relationship between feeding morphology and bite performance between two mouth-oriented piscivores (giant river <b>otters</b> and North American river <b>otters)</b> and two hand-oriented invertebrate specialists (sea <b>otters</b> and Asian small-clawed <b>otters)</b> using morphometric approaches. The second goal was to investigate fluctuating asymmetry in the cranium of <b>otters.</b> The third goal was to characterize feeding mechanisms (kinematics and jaw musculature) and role of bite performance in the trophic ecology of sea <b>otters.</b> Mouth-oriented piscivores possessed longer skulls and mandibles, with jaws designed for increased velocity at the expense of bite capability. Hand-oriented possessed more blunt skulls and mandibles designed for increased bite capability. Sea <b>otters</b> displayed a greater degree of fluctuating asymmetry of the skull, which is likely linked to environmental stresses. Bite performance and durophagous feeding behavior in sea <b>otters</b> was characterized in detail in the feeding kinematics. Estimated bite forces of sea <b>otters</b> were large enough to crush all size classes of butter and littleneck clams tested in the lab. However, sea <b>otters</b> are size selective predators and generally choose bivalves of small to medium size. Medium sized butter and littleneck clams required an intermediate breaking force, and are buried at a shallower depth than larger clams. Clams requiring an intermediate breaking force could decrease consumption time, thus overall handling time...|$|R
5|$|Predation of sea otters does occur, {{although}} it is not common. Many predators find the <b>otter,</b> with their pungent scent glands, distasteful. Young predators may kill an <b>otter</b> and not eat it. Leading mammalian predators of this species include orcas and sea lions; bald eagles also prey on pups by snatching them from the water surface.|$|E
5|$|Since the mid-1970s, {{the beauty}} and {{charisma}} of the species have gained wide appreciation, and the sea <b>otter</b> has become an icon of environmental conservation. The round, expressive face and soft, furry body of the sea <b>otter</b> are depicted {{in a wide variety}} of souvenirs, postcards, clothing, and stuffed toys.|$|E
5|$|The most {{profitable}} furs in the fur trade {{were those of}} sea otters, especially the northern sea <b>otter</b> which inhabited the coastal waters between the Columbia River {{to the south and}} Cook Inlet to the north. The fur of the Californian southern sea <b>otter</b> was less highly prized and thus less profitable. After the northern sea <b>otter</b> was hunted to local extinction, maritime fur traders shifted to California until the southern sea <b>otter</b> was likewise nearly extinct. The British and American maritime fur traders took their furs to the Chinese port of Guangzhou (Canton), where they worked within the established Canton System. Furs from Russian America were mostly sold to China via the Mongolian trading town of Kyakhta, which had been opened to Russian trade by the 1727 Treaty of Kyakhta.|$|E
40|$|The local {{success of}} {{protected}} areas for effective biodiversity conservation depends largely on ensuring the integration of local communities and the persistence of wildlife species and ecological processes. We investigated the perceptions of riverine residents living around a sustainable-use protected area towards giant <b>otters</b> (Pteronura brasiliensis). Between March and December 2011, we conducted 41 interviews with riverine residents {{in the region of}} the National Forest of Amapá (AP, Brazil). These interviews revealed a strong negative attitude towards giant <b>otters,</b> highlighted by recent reports of <b>otters</b> being killed in 12. 2 % of the interviews. Generalized linear models showed that years of education and age weakly predicted attitudes towards <b>otters</b> in the study area (i. e., respondents with the longest time in education and older were less likely to dislike <b>otters</b> and to consider giant <b>otters</b> as damaging income or fishing activities, respectively). These results suggested that to conserve giant <b>otters</b> in this region efforts should focus on environmental education and long-term research projects...|$|R

The new langurs, however, made a habit of constantly bothering and attacking the <b>otters.</b> In June 2007, the <b>otters</b> grabbed a langur that was sitting at the water's edge and proceeded to drown it full view of visitors. A keeper on the viewing deck attempted to break up the fight by whistling and yelling at the <b>otters</b> to no avail. Part of the incident was recorded and uploaded to YouTube. After killing the langur, the <b>otters</b> left the body floating in the pool and it was later removed by keepers. Soon after, the <b>otters</b> were removed from the enclosure and given their own in the Children's Zoo and elsewhere in JungleWorld.|$|R

5|$|The right lung of {{the river}} <b>otter</b> {{is larger than the}} left, having four lobes {{compared}} with two for the left.

In addition, the length of the trachea {{of the river}} <b>otter</b> is intermediate between that of terrestrial carnivores and marine mammals. The mean tracheal length of the river <b>otter</b> is , or 23.2% of the body length. A shorter trachea may improve air exchange and increase lung ventilation in diving mammals.|$|E
5|$|The river <b>otter</b> is {{physically}} well-equipped for aquatic life. The ears are short, the neck {{is the same}} diameter as the head, the legs are short and powerful, the toes are fully webbed, and the tail (one-third of body length) is tapered. These qualities give the river <b>otter</b> a streamlined profile in water, but reduce agility on land. The smell and hearing abilities of the river <b>otter</b> are acute. The <b>otter</b> has a delicate sense of touch in the paws in addition to great dexterity. River otters characteristically approach within {{a few feet of}} a boat or a person on shore because they're near-sighted, a consequence of vision adapted for underwater sight. River otters have transparent nictitating membranes to protect their eyes while swimming.|$|E
