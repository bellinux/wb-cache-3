40|$|Summary. - We briefly {{tackle the}} {{following}} concepts in the Demkov-Ostrovsky (DO) nodeless sector: (i) orbital impedance, (ii) <b>orbital</b> <b>capacity,</b> (iii) closeness to reflectionlessness. Moreover, using previous supersymmetric {{results for the}} DO problem, a strictly isospectral effect in the DO orbital impedances is discussed and explicit plots are displayed for the Maxwell fisheye lens. This effect, though rather small, is general, that is, it may apply to any focusing structure. PACS 03. 65 - Quantum mechanics PACS 11. 30 - Supersymmetry Because {{of one of the}} optical-mechanical analogies, the DO problem can be stated as a Schrödinger radial (half line) equation at zero energy with the focusing potential Vκ(ρ) = −w/ρ 2 [ρ−κ + ρκ] 2, where w> 0 is a (Sturmian type) coupling constant, ρ is a scaled radial variable (r/R), and κ (> 0) is the Lenz-Demkov-Ostrovsky parameter, which is unity for the Maxwell fish eye (MFE) lens, and one half for an atomic aufbau model [1]. In previous works [2], a supersymmetric, Witten approach of the DO problem in the nodeless radial sector n = l + 1 (1 s, 2 p, 3 d [...] .) has been put forward. Moreover, the strictly isospectral double Darboux method has been worked out with the interesting result that a one-parameter family of Maxwell lenses having the same optical scattering properties in the nodeless sector might exist [3]. In this note, still within the same nodeless sector, we will refer to the concepts of DO orbital impedance and <b>orbital</b> <b>capacity.</b> Moreover, we mention a problem that we call “closeness to reflectionlessness”. The strictly isospectral effect [3] is graphically displayed using the language of impedances that may have some advantages not only in technological applications. (i) Orbital impedance: Martin and Sabatier showed in a general context that a localized...|$|E
40|$|Main goal of {{re-entry}} experiments is {{to verify}} technologies, mainly for thermal protection systems, and simulation tools regarding hypersonic gas flow and structural response. A full scale re-entry test flight is expensive and needs in general a launch system with <b>orbital</b> <b>capacity.</b> To simplify {{and to reduce}} costs a step by step approach seems to be practicable and less risky. Thus, sounding rockets are a very attractive vehicle to perform related research. Even, they do not cover the whole performance to accelerate the entry vehicle to real re-entry conditions; they allow generating interesting flight conditions to verify aerodynamic simulation tools. On June 22 nd 2012 the second flight within the SHEFEX (Sharp Edge Flight Experiments) development program was successfully performed at Andoya Rocket Range in Norway. Despite {{of the loss of}} the hardware, 95...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study {{was performed to}} develop the major features of a large <b>capacity</b> <b>orbital</b> propellant storage facility for the space-based cryogenic orbital transfer vehicle. Projected propellant usage and delivery schedules can be accommodated by two orbital tank sets of 100, 000 lb storage capacity, with advanced missions expected to require increased capacity. Information is given on tank pressurization schemes, propellant transfer configurations, pump specifications, the refrigeration system, and flight tests...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to its use by ESA and Russia, the ATV was at one point under consider to perform services for NASA {{as part of the}} Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program to replace the retiring Space Shuttle in its <b>orbital</b> cargo carrying <b>capacity.</b> Under the proposal, which had been issued by a joint venture between EADS and Boeing, the ATV would be launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, using a Delta IV rocket. One speculated use for NASA's ATV was to achieve the de-orbiting of the ISS once the space station had reached the end of its service life, being the only vehicle capable of doing so at that time after the Shuttle's retirement. Ultimately, the proposal was not awarded with a corresponding contract.|$|R
40|$|On-orbit {{collision}} risk {{is becoming}} an increasing mission risk to all operational satellites in Earth orbit. Managing this risk can be disruptive to mission and operations, present challenges for decision-makers, and is time-consuming for all parties involved. With the planned capability improvements to detecting and tracking smaller <b>orbital</b> debris and <b>capacity</b> improvements to routinely predict on-orbit conjunctions, this mission risk {{will continue to grow}} in terms of likelihood and effort. It is very real possibility that the future space environment will not allow collision risk management and mission operations to be conducted {{in the same manner as}} it is today. This paper presents the concept of a finite conjunction assessment-one where each discrete conjunction is not treated separately but, rather, as a continuous event that must be managed concurrently. The paper also introduces the Total Probability of Collision as an analogous metric for finite conjunction assessment operations and provides several options for its usage in a Concept of Operations...|$|R
40|$|The various {{congenital}} {{and acquired}} conditions which alter orbital volume are reviewed. Previous investigative work to determine <b>orbital</b> <b>capacity</b> is summarized. Since these studies {{were confined to}} postmortem evaluations, {{the need for a}} technique to measure orbital volume in the living state is presented. A method for volume determination of the orbit and its contents by high-resolution axial tomography and quantitative digital image analysis is reported. This procedure has proven to be accurate (the discrepancy between direct and computed measurements ranged from 0. 2 % to 4 %) and reproducible (greater than 98 %). The application of this method to representative clinical problems is presented and discussed. The establishment of a diagnostic system versatile enough to expand the usefulness of computerized axial tomography and polytomography should add a new dimension to ophthalmic investigation and treatment...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study has developed the major {{features of a}} large <b>capacity</b> <b>orbital</b> propellant depot for the space-based, cryogenic OTV. The study has treated both the Dual-Keel Space Station and co-orbiting platforms as the accommodations base for the propellant storage facilities, and trades have examined both tethered and hard-docked options. Five tank set concepts were developed for storing the propellants, and along with layout options for the station and platform, were evaluated from the standpoints of servicing, propellant delivery, boiloff, micrometeoroid/debris shielding, development requirements, and cost. These trades led to the recommendation that an all-passive storage concept be considered for the platform and an actively refrigerated concept providing for reliquefaction of all boiloff be considered for the Space Station. The tank sets are modular, each storing up to 45, 400 kg of LO 2 /LH 2, and employ many advanced features to provide for microgravity fluid management and to limit boiloff. The features include such technologies as zero-gravity mass gauging, total communication capillary liquid acquisition devices, autogenous pressurization, thermodynamic vent systems, thick multilayer insulation, vapor-cooled shields, solar-selective coatings, advanced micrometeoroid/debris protection systems, and long-lived cryogenic refrigeration systems...|$|R
