40|$|ABSTRACT An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of varying dietary supplemental inclusion levels of <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> garlic mixture on semen quality characteristics of Koekoek breeder cocks aged 35 - 41 weeks. The experimental diets were isocaloric and isonitrogenous but with different supplemental inclusion levels of <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> garlic. A complete randomized design was used for the experiment. The three dietary supplemental levels based on garlic <b>and</b> <b>onion</b> supplemental inclusion levels were Q 0 (0 g <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> 0 g garlic per 600 g DM feed), Q 1 (2. 5 g <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> 2. 5 g garlic per 600 g DM feed), and Q 2 (5 g <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> 5 g garlic per 600 g DM feed) with each treatment having three replicates. A quadratic type equation was used to determine the <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> garlic levels for optimum semen quality characteristics. Daily supplementation with 5 g <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> 5 g garlic per 600 g DM feed increased progressive motile cells (%), actual life sperm count (× 106 /nl), and live sperm (%) by 221. 20 %, 301. 51 %, and 352. 43 %, while 2. 5 g <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> 2. 5 g garlic per 600 g DM feed reduced them by 28. 67 %, 12. 69 %, and 19. 00 %, respectively. However, daily supplementation with 2. 5 g <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> 2. 5 g garlic per 600 g DM feed increased sperm count (× 106 /nl) by 12. 82 %, whereas daily supplementation with 5 g <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> 5 g garlic per 600 g DM feed reduced it by 10. 26 % in Koekoek breeder cocks. Dietary <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> garlic supplemental inclusion levels of 3. 009, 3. 191, 4. 621, 6. 601, 6. 719, 2. 327, 2. 385, and 2. 247 g per 600 g DM feed supported optimum progressive motile cells (%), immotile sperm cells (%), actual dead sperm count (× 106 /nl), actual live sperm count (× 106 /nl), live sperm (%), acrosome morphology defects (%), acrosome detachment (%), and acrosome swelling (%), with probability values ranging from 0. 003 to 0. 783, whereas minimum progressive motile cells (%) increase was achieved at an optimum <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> garlic supplementation levels of 3. 009 g per 600 g DM feed. These findings have a lot of implications on the use of supplemental <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> garlic inclusion levels to enhance reproductive efficiency in Koekoek breeder cocks...|$|R

5|$|Cooking <b>onions</b> <b>and</b> sweet {{onions are}} better stored at room temperature, optimally {{in a single}} layer, in mesh bags in a dry, cool, dark, well-ventilated location. In this environment, cooking onions have a shelf life of {{three to four weeks}} and sweet onions one to two weeks. Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears. Also, they draw {{moisture}} from vegetables with which they are stored which may cause them to decay.|$|E

The staple diet consisted {{of bread and}} beer, supplemented with vegetables such as <b>onions</b> <b>and</b> garlic, and fruit such as dates and figs. Wine and meat were enjoyed by all on feast days while the upper classes indulged on a more regular basis. Fish, meat, and fowl could be salted or dried, and could be cooked in stews or roasted on a grill.|$|E

5|$|In Ancient China, rice was {{the staple}} crop {{in the south}} and wheat in the north, the latter made into dumplings, noodles, and pancakes. Vegetables used to {{accompany}} these included yams, soybeans, broad beans, turnips, spring <b>onions,</b> <b>and</b> garlic. The diet of the ancient Egyptians was based on bread, often contaminated with sand which wore away their teeth. Meat was a luxury but fish was more plentiful. These were accompanied by a range of vegetables including marrows, broad beans, lentils, onions, leeks, garlic, radishes, and lettuces.|$|E

5|$|In modern versions, Caerphilly {{cheese is}} used, {{which is a}} {{descendant}} of the old traditional Glamorgan cheese recipe and lends the same general texture and flavour. The basic recipe calls for a mixture of cheese, leeks and breadcrumbs, although some recipes swap the leeks for onions or spring <b>onions</b> <b>and</b> may add herbs such as parsley or further flavourings such as mustard. The mixture is then rolled into sausage shapes, and then fried. There is no sausage casing used, although egg is used to bind the mixture {{so that it does}} not fall apart during the cooking process.|$|E

5|$|The {{mainstay}} of the Ancient Greek diet was bread, and this was accompanied by goat's cheese, olives, figs, fish, and occasionally meat. The vegetables grown included onions, garlic, cabbages, melons, and lentils. In Ancient Rome, a thick porridge was made of emmer wheat or beans, accompanied by green vegetables but little meat, and fish was not esteemed. The Romans grew broad beans, peas, <b>onions</b> <b>and</b> turnips and ate the leaves of beets rather than their roots.|$|E
5|$|This group {{contains}} {{shallots and}} potato onions, {{also referred to}} as multiplier onions. The bulbs are smaller than those of common <b>onions,</b> <b>and</b> a single plant forms an aggregate cluster of several bulbs. They are propagated almost exclusively from daughter bulbs, although reproduction from seed is possible. Shallots are the most important subgroup within this group and comprise the only cultivars cultivated commercially. They form aggregate clusters of small, narrowly ovoid to pear-shaped bulbs. Potato onions differ from shallots in forming larger bulbs with fewer bulbs per cluster, and having a flattened (onion-like) shape. However, intermediate forms exist.|$|E
