The rough walls, pale yellow, in {{combination}} with the paneled ceiling and colonial casings, painted cream, had surely created a perfect background for the admirable furnishings. Never before had quaint chairs and deep couches looked so inviting as these in Morris cottons. Their creamy tone, relieved by soft browns and warm yellows, defied the sordid observer, who could never quite estimate their yard value. The broad windows were curtained in simple falls of dainty lace of <b>open</b> <b>texture</b> that excluded neither sunlight nor landscape. In the colonial fireplace burned a real fire of huge logs, that was never allowed to die out, and warmed with irresistible comfort the fresh, healthful atmosphere of the room. In unsuspected corners and in bold situations, great satsuma jars filled with ferns and tall papyrus emphasized the possibilities of a Pasadena home. Cheerful watercolors in plain white frames adorned the walls, while above the fire, an old French mirror caught from the picture-window opposite the distant shadows and sunlit spurs of the peaceful Mother Mountains. Long-stemmed roses and dear old silver candlesticks gleamed side by side upon a quaint, inviting tea-table, which, close by the glowing fire, shone like a glimpse from America's most picturesque period, adorned with the dainty relics of a colonial tea-set.|$|E

40|$|Nakhlak lead mine {{is located}} at the Nakhlak {{mountain}} 55 km NE of Anarak town in Isfahan province. The mineralogy is simple; galena and barite are the main primary minerals and cerussite is the main secondary mineral. Sphalerite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, tetrahedrite-tennantite and acanthite occur as minor and trace mineral inclusions in galena. Secondary minerals are anglesite, plattnerite, wulfenite and malachite. The host rock has undergone a pre-mineralization dolomitization process. Four types of dolomite have been identified which saddle dolomite is the most distinguished. <b>Open</b> space filling <b>textures</b> occur in the form of breccia, cockade, crustification and colloform. Analysis of the galena samples indicates presence of many trace elements in galena among which silver is the most important. Element pairs such as Ag-As, Zn-Cd, As-Cu and As-Sb are highly correlated. This correlation may be explained by the presence of inclusions. Ag-Sb-Bi ternary diagram indicates that galena samples from Nakhlak are rich in Ag and Sb and poor in Bi. Sb/Bi (3773) ratio in galena is suggestive of a low temperature of formation for the deposit. The Upper Cretaceous carbonate host rocks and their dolomitization, the stratabound and epigenetic mineralization, the absence of igneous activity, the <b>open</b> space filling <b>texture,</b> the simple mineralogy and geochemistry all point to a Mississippi valley type model for the Nakhlak Pb deposit. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Bacuri copper deposit {{is located}} about 9 km {{east of the}} {{world-class}} Sossego iron oxide–copper–gold deposit in the Carajás Province. It is hosted by the ca. 2. 84 Ga Serra Dourada granite, the Bacuri Porphyry, and subordinated gabbro. The Bacuri deposit is situated with-in the regional-scale, WNW-ESE-trending ductile Canaã shear zone, characterized by early albite, scapolite-magnetite, potassium feldspar and biotite-scapolite-magnetite hydrothermal alteration zones. Copper mineralization was controlled and largely simultaneous to the develop-ment of a NE-SW-trending transcurrent fault zone. Within this zone, intense chlorite alteration, silicification and quartz veining overlap pre-vious hydrothermal stages. Copper ore (chalcopyrite-pyrite-magnetite) is disseminated and related to veins and breccias. Chalcopyrite occurs along the mylonitic foliation in chlorite alteration zones, in brecciated quartz-(muscovite-fluorite) and undeformed milky quartz veins and in late potassium feldspar-epidote veinlets with <b>open</b> space <b>textures.</b> The relative temporal history of the Bacuri deposit reveals significant changes in physico-chemical parameters during the system evolution. Contribution of hot hypersaline metalliferous fluids was important during early sodic and potassic alteration stages and related to a regional hydrothermal system developed at relatively deep crustal levels. Influx of externally derived diluted fluids within the NE-SW-trending fault zone favoured the late shallow-emplaced chlorite alteration and silicification, and may have triggered the ore deposition due to decrease of tem-perature and salinity, accompanied by ƒO 2 increase and pH decrease. Such significant changes could indicate a hybrid system that evolved in multiple pulses during progressive exhumation...|$|R

50|$|Legends {{about the}} Yorkshire Dales, {{the area that}} {{includes}} Swaledale, say the origin of cheese making lie with Cistercian monks from Normandy who settled {{in the area in}} the 11th century. Their techniques were passed on to local farmers in Swaledale who continued to produce cheese, although the monks left during the dissolution of the monasteries. In 18th century cheese was produced at farmhouses within Swaledale and sold fresh with a white colour or ripe once they had developed a blue colouration. These cheese’s high moisture content and <b>open</b> <b>texture</b> allowed them to blue easily when they were matured in damp conditions. Cheese making started to decline in Swaledale {{at the start of the}} 20th century and by 1980 only one farm in Swaledale, Harkerside above Reeth, was still making cheese. In the early 1980s this cheese stopped being produced as well, until Mrs. Longstaff gave the original recipe for Swaledale Cheese to David and Mandy Reeds who founded the Swaledale Cheese company in February 1987 to produce the cheese.|$|E

Instead, Ely argued that the Supreme Court should interpret the Constitution so as to reinforce democratic processes and popular self-government, by ensuring equal representation in the political process (as in the Court's decision in Baker v. Carr 1961). He argues ejusdem generis that the Constitution's unenumerated rights (such as the 9th Amendment or the Privileges or Immunities clause of the 14th Amendment) are procedural in nature rather than substantive, thus protecting rights to democratic processes but not rights of a substantive nature. Justice Stone's Footnote Four from United States v. Carolene Products Co. (1938) is a chief inspiration for Ely's theory of judicial review.|$|E
5000|$|FMA is a gap-graded {{mix with}} a high coarse {{aggregate}} (stone) content of 70-80 %, binder (asphalt) content of 6 % and filler (limestone sand) content of around 7-11 %. The percentage of cellulose fibre that {{is required for the}} FMA is 0.4 % and air voids of around 4 %. The skeletal formation of the coarse aggregate provides high resistance to deformation. Adding the fibres to the binder will prevent the asphalt from draining off during storage, transport and paving. The mastic fills the voids and retaining the aggregate in place. It has an additional stabilising effect, as well as providing the designed air voids. The result is a highly durable rut resistant asphalt mix. FMA can be used on all types of road and it is suitable for roads with heavy traffic loads and frequency. It is high binder content gives a longer lifetime than conventional mixes. Furthermore, it allows for the bitumen to bulk or thicken in order to prevent it from running off the aggregate before compaction. Its coarse and <b>open</b> <b>texture</b> generally provides high skid resistance at all speeds, as well as good drainage and fewer spray problems. Modification and stabilization of the asphalt binder is the approach to improve the pavement performance especially for the gap-graded mixtures such as FMA, which required higher viscosity asphalt binder. The method for this asphalt binder modification is by adding cellulose fibre and other oil- based materials are being used to enhance the viscosity of the base binder.|$|E
