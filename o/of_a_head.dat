5|$|A stylized {{flower of}} a Hippeastrum {{cultivar}} (under its common name of amaryllis) is used internationally {{as a symbol}} for organizations associated with Huntington's disease, a genetic degenerative disease of the nervous system. The widely used logo represents a double image <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> and shoulders as the flower of a growing and vibrant plant. The reduced size of the inner head and shoulders image symbolizes the diminution in a person caused by Huntington's disease. The leaves represent the protection, purpose, growth {{and development of the}} Huntington's community worldwide in its search for a cure and treatment.|$|E
5|$|In late 1992 Takanohana {{announced}} his engagement to actress Rie Miyazawa, news which sparked a similar amount of coverage {{to the royal}} wedding held that year. However the engagement was broken off the following year, reportedly because Miyazawa was seen by Takanohana's parents and the Sumo Association as being unwilling to sacrifice her career to become a regular stable wife. The role of the wife <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> coach in looking after the stable's recruits and liaising with supporter's groups {{is regarded as a}} full-time job.|$|E
5|$|Pedro II may be {{considered}} a rare instance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> of state who, despite being overwhelmingly beloved by his people, despite international admiration and acclamation, despite having been instrumental in driving forward major liberal social and economic reforms, despite overseeing a period of outstanding prosperity and influence during a reign covering nearly six decades, and despite being considered a highly successful ruler to the end, was ultimately subjected to overthrow and exile. The republican revolution which replaced the Empire led to decades of disruption and dictatorship.|$|E

5|$|Planarians, a {{subgroup}} of seriates, {{are famous for}} their ability to regenerate if divided by cuts across their bodies. Experiments show that, in fragments that do not already have a head, a new head grows most quickly on those closest to the original head. This suggests the growth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> is controlled by a chemical whose concentration diminishes from head to tail. Many turbellarians clone themselves by transverse or longitudinal division, and others, especially acoels, reproduce by budding.|$|E
5|$|SAH {{may occur}} as a result <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> injury or spontaneously, usually from a {{ruptured}} cerebral aneurysm. Risk factors for spontaneous cases included high blood pressure, smoking, family history, alcoholism, and cocaine use. Generally, the diagnosis can be determined by a CT scan of the head if done within six hours. Occasionally a lumbar puncture is also required. After confirmation further tests are usually performed to determine the underlying cause.|$|E

5|$|Cox {{sold the}} head in 1799 for £230 (about £7,400 in today's money) to three {{brothers}} named Hughes. Interested in starting their own display in Bond Street, the brothers acquired the head as part of other Cromwell-related items. Thousands of posters were produced for the event, but the exhibit was marred by doubtful provenance. The Hughes brothers and their publicist, John Cranch, wrote Cox {{to ask about the}} gaps in the journey, but Cox was evasive, leading to concerns that he had sold them a fake. Indeed, Cranch could not come up with a documentary history of how the head came into their hands, so improvised a story that Cromwell's head was “the only instance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> cut off and spiked that had before been embalmed; which is precisely the case with respect to {{the head in}} question”. Although Henry Ireton had also been embalmed before being beheaded, the story stuck, but it was in vain. The exhibition was a failure. The entrance fee was high (two shillings and sixpence, about the equivalent of £5) and rumours that the head was a fake were prevalent.|$|E
5|$|On 10 November Belfast {{was taken}} off the {{northern}} patrol and reassigned to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron. This squadron was to form an independent striking force based at Rosyth. On 21 November, Belfast was {{to take part in the}} force's first sortie, a gunnery exercise. At 10:58am she struck a magnetic mine while leaving the Firth of Forth. The mine broke Belfasts keel, and wrecked one of her engine and boiler rooms. Twenty officers and men required hospital treatment for injuries caused by the explosion, and a further 26 suffered minor injuries. One man, Painter 2nd Class Henry Stanton, was hospitalised but later died <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> injury, having been thrown against the deckhead by the blast. The tugboat Krooman, towing gunnery targets for the exercise, released her targets and instead towed Belfast to Rosyth for initial repairs.|$|E
5|$|The post {{was created}} by the Treaty of Lisbon and was subject to a debate over its exact role. Prior to Lisbon, the Presidency rotated in {{accordance}} with the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The role of that President-in-Office was in no sense (other than protocol) equivalent to an office <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> of state, merely a primus inter pares (first among equals) role among other European heads of government. The President-in-Office was primarily responsible for preparing and chairing the Council meetings, and had no executive powers other than the task of representing the Union externally. Now the leader of the Council Presidency country can still act as president when the permanent president is absent.|$|E

5|$|Ron Wolf, who {{had been}} the Oakland Raiders’ Director of Player Personnel since 1963 and was {{credited}} with much of their success, was hired as Vice President of Operations. Los Angeles Rams general manager Don Klosterman and former Kansas City Chiefs head coach Hank Stram were early candidates for the job; but Klosterman withdrew, and Stram was interested in a combined coach/general manager position. Wolf was directly responsible for the drafting of 20 of the Raiders’ 22 starters, and his effectiveness at scouting talent was believed to be a major reason for the Raiders’ being one of the few teams not to belong to a scouting combine. The Buccaneers quickly developed a Raiders flavor, choosing to hire a scouting staff rather than rely on the computerized scouting reports that almost all other teams were using, and hiring Raiders business manager Ken LaRue to serve in the same capacity. One of Wolf’s responsibilities was to assist in the hiring <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> coach. Wolf persuaded Culverhouse {{that it would be better}} for any prospect to gain a year of experience and knowledge in his present job, rather than be named at expansion time, when there was little or no advantage to having a coach in place.|$|E
