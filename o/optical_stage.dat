40|$|A dual-probe, {{integrated}} fiber-optic {{laser system}} for measuring blade tip clearance in rotating turbomachinery was developed cooperatively with Integrated Fiber Optic Systems, Inc., and tested at the NASA Lewis Research Center. Because the probes are nearly {{flush with the}} casing inner lining, there is minimal flow disturbance. The two probes are closely spaced in a circumferential plane and are slanted at an angle relative to each other so that {{the time it takes}} the blade tip to traverse the space between the two beams varies with the tip radius, making it possible to determine the tip clearance at rotor operating conditions. The tip clearance can be obtained for all the blades in a rotor with a single system, provided there are no synchronous vibrations present at a particular operating condition. The two probes for the laser system were installed in two holders. For one, the included angle between the probes was 20 degrees, and for the other, it was 40 degrees. The two configurations were calibrated in a vacuum spin-rig facility that can reproduce realistic blade-tip speeds. A specially designed, nondeflecting rotor was used to calibrate the probes. This rotor consisted of a tapered titanium bar with three teeth on each end, the thickness of which was representative of a typical blade-tip thickness. The bar and measuring teeth were in a horizontal plane in the spin rig, and the axis of rotation was vertical. To set the clearances, we used a remotely controlled <b>optical</b> <b>stage</b> that could be traversed vertically. The 40 probe system also was used to measure the tip clearance during an engine fan prototype test in a wind tunnel.

40|$|Optofluidics is a {{promising}} interdisciplinary research and technological field, {{thanks to its}} wide potential of application in sector like medicine, chemistry, biology and environmental science. In this context the study of innovative materials including their properties, their efficiency, their limits and their possibility of leading to miniaturized devices is the key point for the overcoming of currently adopted strategies. A promising material that could satisfy new optofluidic requirements is Lithium Niobate (LiNbO 3 - LN) thanks to its excellent optical and nonlinear optical properties. In this work we demonstrated {{for the first time}} the applicability of the Lithium Niobate as a high intagrable and tailorable substrate for optofluidics. As a matter of fact, we developed all the several stages that can be interconnected to realize a platform with complex optofluidic functionalities: from the droplets generation and manipulation, to their transfer through a microfluidic channel directly engraved on the crystal substrate, to the droplets optical analysis stage. In particular in this thesis we present the first high performant T-Junction droplet generator completely engraved in LN, and the first Ti in-diffused channel waveguide coupled with a microfluidic channel in the same substrate. Furthermore a study on the wetting properties of the Lithium Niobate is discussed. Concerning the <b>optical</b> <b>stage</b> we discuss the realization of optical frequency converter realized in LN, which plays a key role in the development of our optofluidic platform. In fact it can be used to integrate a laser source in the green-blue range that could found application particularly in the biological field.

Also we implemented the process to produce single-mode channel waveguide by Ti in-diffusion as interconnection stage for the optical circuit. Concluding, we were able to implement a well-equipped tool-box for the incorporation of different devices on the same substrate, demonstrating {{for the first time the}} integration of all the different stages in a single substrate, and paving the way to an extreme optofluidic integration in Lithium Niobate. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} thesis' work is {{to realize}} and {{characterize}} an integrated detector for the measurements of speed and volume of droplets. The measure is simultaneously made on a flux of droplets moving in microchannel, detecting single droplet one by one. The device consists in a novel configuration chip made of lithium niobate, on which a microfluidic circuit and an optical waveguide Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) are integrated on the same platform. The system is composed of two main stages: Optical and Microfluidic. The first is a waveguide that divides in two y-branches and two parallel arms to configure MZI. The arms of interferometer are crossed orthogonally by a microfluidic channel, in which droplets are generated by Microfluidic Stage. This one consists in a cross junction, where droplets are produced by cross-flow of immiscible phases. During the flowing of droplets in the channel, arms of MZI illuminate alternately dispersed and continuous phases. In this way, an intensity signal is collected {{at the end of}} MZI, where all information of the droplets can be read thanks to the difference in diffraction index between two liquids. This novel configuration has several advantages. It can allow for different functionalities such as: measure of droplet speed: it can be detected the time of passing droplet in front of guide; measure of droplet length: it can be easily provided {{from the time of the}} flowing of single menisci, both ahead and back; measure of droplet refraction index: with interferometric signal of the different liquids in front of arms. In this work the geometry of the two main stages are deep investigated in order to optimize the performance of this device. Both cross-junction and MZI in waveguide were already studied in literature, but a low-loss MZI design for optofluidic droplet application has not been mentioned yet. In this work all elements of MZI in waveguide are accurately described with care for low-loss and compatibility with droplet size: from Y-branches to tapered section. Both theoretical and fabrication process studies have been realized on all of key section of MZI configuration. All of them were fabricated in single mode channel waveguide at a wavelength of 632. 8 nm by titanium in-diffusion. Subsequently a wide analysis was made in order to guarantee reproducibility: they were optically characterized with Near Field technique. Results were reported and reached performance are highlighted. After the best configuration was obtained, the optical signal of the flowing droplets have been studied. To reach this goal, single waveguide has been used as <b>optical</b> <b>stage,</b> properly coupled with microfluidic one. These samples have helped to understand optofluidics interaction between droplet and guided beam. Promising results have been achieved in this configuration and presented in thesis. First results and tests are reported in this work for MZI configuration with air droplet, four working regimes are founded and studied. The device has been tested with random sequence of droplets in the same running section and MZI signal demonstrated that it can recognize all these droplet in length and velocities reconstructing the sequence. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the work for}} the PhD in Aerospace, Naval and Total Quality Management of the University of Naples “Federico II” from 2008 to 2011. The work was mostly performed at National Institute of Astrophysics (INAF) - Astronomical Observatory of Capodimonte, Naples, Italy, and partly at European Space Agency (ESA) - European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC), Noordwijk, The Netherlands. The activities for the present thesis were focused on the investigation of dust in the Mars atmosphere. The key subjects covered are: investigation of Mars with the ESA-NASA ExoMars Programme; study of the MEDUSA experiment {{for the analysis of}} dust in the Martian atmosphere at ground level; study of the MicroMED instrument, aimed at miniaturizing MEDUSA for the DREAMS proposal package (ExoMars EDM 2016) or other future mission opportunities. The work starts with {{a detailed description of the}} Martian boundary conditions, based on past exploration missions, with emphasis on properties of grains dispersed in the atmosphere. The original work performed for this thesis is within the ESA-NASA ExoMars Programme, a challenging space project for the exploration of Mars. Tasks have been accomplished on several aspects of the MEDUSA and MicroMED experiments, as possible scientific payload of the mission modules foreseen for landing, and on some specific aspects of the ExoMars Programme, during the permanence for a period of 3 months at ESA-ESTEC. The ExoMars Programme, in its present configuration, includes a mission in 2016 (EDM, i. e., Entry Descent and Landing Demonstrator Module, and TGO, i. e., Trace Gas Orbiter) and a mission in 2018 (Rover). Some tasks were accomplished at ESA-ESTEC: 1) The preparation of the Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for the selection of the ExoMars EDM 2016 payload by checking the engineering requirements, defined in the EDL Demonstrator Module Payload Experiment Proposal Information Package; 2) A review of the requirements of the scientific sensors of the Pasteur Payload (PPL) on board the ExoMars Rover allowing the update of the definition of the top level science, measurement, accommodation and deployment requirements; 3) The elaboration of the ExoMars Rover Reference Surface Mission to define the nominal operative scenario of the ExoMars Rover on the surface of Mars by determining the power and energy utilization timelines of the PPL, Drill and Sample Preparation and Distribution System (SPDS) on the basis of the Rover engineering requirements, energetic resources, and SPRD. As a member of the MEDUSA and MicroMED instrument teams, I performed detailed studies on fluid dynamics and light scattering aspects, relevant for the instrument development. The goals have been to prepare and perform numerical and experimental analyses on the working principle of sensors for aerosol measurements (i. e., aerosol aspiration and light scattering analysis of the dispersed grains) and, then, to contribute to the design of the two instruments. The MEDUSA instrument was designed by INAF-OAC and selected for the ExoMars Humboldt Payload (HPL) mission to accomplish measurements of dust grain sizes, size distribution and concentration in the grain diameter range of 0. 2 - 20 μm, and the water vapour abundance at the Martian landing site. The work performed during this thesis has included numerical and experimental activities to characterize the functionality of the MEDUSA breadboard. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis was performed to study the fluid flow and particle trajectories in the MEDUSA <b>Optical</b> <b>Stage</b> (OS, the optical module where light scattering analysis on crossing grains is performed). A pre-processor for discretizing the domains and a numerical solver were used. The CFD analysis was done by simulating aerosol flows and solving fluid dynamics fields by coupling the Navier-Stokes equations in finite volumes (Eulerian approach) with the dynamics equations for discrete particles phases (Lagrangian approach). Experimental tests were executed both in laboratory simulated Martian conditions on the MEDUSA OS breadboard and its optical components in order to evaluate the validity of the working principle and functionality. In the end of 2009 ESA and NASA descoped the Humboldt Payload according to a general design review of the ExoMars Programme, deciding to re-select the payload, via an Announcement of Opportunity, for a new lander concept, the ExoMars EDM 2016, with a maximum scientific payload of 3 kg. Therefore, a relevant fraction of the work for this thesis was focused on changing from MEDUSA to a new miniaturized and efficient system, called MicroMED, to perform measurements of grain size in the Martian lower atmosphere. The baseline design of MicroMED was aimed at simplifying the sub-systems and the working principle of the instrument in order to reduce the resource requirements. The new goal for MicroMED included drastic reduction of the mass from about 3 kg to less than 0. 3 kg, and power consumption from about 21 W to 1 - 1. 5 W. Therefore, a simplified optical working principle with a single detection channel in a wider angle from normal-direction scattering was adopted, instead of four channels (forward and backward direction for scattering detection, each one amplified both with high and low gain) implemented in MEDUSA. An accurate fluid dynamics re-design of the instrument was done in this thesis in order to optimize the device functionality, allowing MicroMED to accomplish the same scientific requirements of MEDUSA for what concerns the measurements of the dust grain sizes. Part of the thesis activity was also dedicated to the definition and technical organization of the DREAMS (Dust characterization, Risk assessment and Environmental Analyzer on the Martian Surface) package for the ExoMars EDM 2016 mission, which included in its proposed version the MicroMED instrument...|$|E
40|$|A {{new design}} for a {{photovoltaic}} concentrator, the most recent advance based on the Kohler concept, is presented. The system is mirror-based, and with geometry that guaranties a maximum sunlight collection area (without shadows, like those caused by secondary stages or receivers and heat-sinks in other mirror-based systems). Designed for a concentration of 1000 x, this off axis system combines both good acceptance angle and good irradiance uniformity on the solar cell. The advanced performance features (concentration-acceptance products ?CAP- about 0. 73 and affordable peak and average irradiances) are achieved through the combination of four reflective folds combined with four refractive surfaces, all of them free-form, performing Köhler integration 2. In Köhler devices, the irradiance uniformity is not achieved through additional <b>optical</b> <b>stages</b> (TIR prisms), thus no complex/expensive elements to manufacture are required. The rim angle and geometry are such that the secondary stage and receivers are hidden below the primary mirrors, so maximum collection is assured. The entire system was designed to allow loose assembly/alignment tolerances (through high acceptance angle) and to be manufactured using already well-developed methods for mass production, with high potential for low cost. The optical surfaces for Köhler integration, although with a quite different optical behavior, have approximately the same dimensions and can be manufactured with the same techniques as the more traditional secondary optical elements used for concentration (typically plastic injection molding or glass molding) ...|$|R

In an excess of oxygen superoxide (O 2 –) is generally the primary charge-carrying species that is generated. However, subsequent reactions leading to the finally detected ion signals remain obscure. METHODSSince adiabatic expansion induced cluster growth and collision-induced dissociation (CID) processes rendered a representative sampling of ion distributions present in the source difficult, a custom-built thermally sampling time-of-flight mass spectrometer {{was used for the}} investigations. Using atmospheric pressure laser ionization of toluene as the reagent gas, high yields of thermal electrons were observed, but only negligible amounts of by-products.

In the enrollment <b>stage,</b> <b>optical</b> ﬂow is used to deﬁne a stability model of the genuine signatures for each signer. In the veriﬁcation stage, the stability between the unknown signature and {{each one of the}} reference signatures is estimated and consistency with the stability model of the signer is evaluated. The experimental results, carried out on the signatures in the GPDS database, demonstrate the effectiveness of the {{new approach}}...|$|R
40|$|A new two {{series of}} liquid {{crystalline}} Schiff bases containing thiazole moiety with different length of alkoxy spacer were synthesized, and {{the relation between}} the spacer length and the liquid crystalline behavior was investigated. The molecular structures of these compounds were performed by elemental analysis and FTIR, 1 HNMR spectroscopy. The liquid crystalline properties were examined by hot <b>stage</b> <b>optical</b> polarizing microscopy (OPM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). All compouns of the two series display liquid crystalline nematic mesophase. The liquid crystalline behaviour has been analyzed in terms of structural property relationship...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} 4 -aminoazobenzene dye units have been {{synthesised}} {{and subjected to}} thermal analysis by differential scanning calorimetry and hot <b>stage</b> <b>optical</b> microscopy. It is observed that liquid crystalline phase behaviour exists for those dyes having a nitro group in the 4 -position on the terminal phenyl ring and with a short hydrocarbon 'tail' at the amino site with a terminal alcohol. Other structures in the series were not liquid crystalline. It appears that a highly polar terminal group and short hydrocarbon tail is required to form thermotropic mesophases...|$|R
