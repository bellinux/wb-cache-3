40|$|The {{proximity}} compatibility principle (PCP) {{proposes that}} visually unitary con-figurations of data values, such as <b>object</b> <b>displays,</b> will support information inte-gration better than will more separable formats. In {{the present study}} formats were created by either mixing or matching pairs of lower-level codes (i. e., linear extent, angle, and color). Performance with object and separable configurations of these codes was compared for two integration tasks: system state classifications requir-ing either (1) comparisons of values or (2) identification of conjunctions of values. <b>Object</b> <b>displays</b> formed with matched codes {{were more likely to}} facilitate compar-isons, whereas <b>object</b> <b>displays</b> formed from mixed codes were more likely to facil-itate conjunction identification. These data suggest that two mechanisms may underlie <b>object</b> <b>display</b> advantages for integration-one based on relational prop-erties or emergent features and one based on the efficient processing of the lower-level codes themselves. ...|$|R

40|$|Visual display {{design for}} dynamic systems may {{be helped by}} {{exploiting}} emergent features that allow subjects to easily distinguish different states of the system. Three different types of <b>displays</b> were compared-two <b>object</b> <b>displays</b> and one separated display-each in a version that had a salient emergent feature that distinguished normal and failed states and in a version {{that did not have}} such an emergent feature. Subjects monitored for global and local failures simultaneously, which presented demands similar to integrated and separated tasks, respectively. Displays with salient emergent features supported superior global failure detection and may also have helped local failure detection. An <b>object</b> <b>display</b> with a salient emergent feature supported both types of failures better than or at least {{as well as the other}} displays. This advantage was attributed to the fact that the display had a salient emergent feature rather than to the fact that it was an <b>object</b> <b>display.</b> This research shows that emergent features can be effectively exploited to support tasks involving both integration of information and attention to individual data sources...|$|R
