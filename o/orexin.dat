40|$|<b>Orexins</b> A and B are two {{hypothalamic}} peptides, {{involved in}} the central regulation of feeding, which act through two receptor subtypes, named OX 1 R and OX 2 R. OX 1 R is selective for orexin-A, and OX 2 R binds both <b>orexins.</b> We have investigated the effects of three subcutaneous injections of 10 nmol/kg body weight of <b>orexins</b> on the secretion and proliferative activity of immature (20 -day-old) and regenerating rat adrenal cortex. The presence of both OX 1 R and OX 2 R mRNAs has been detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in adult, immature and regenerating adrenals. Orexin-A increased corticosterone plasma concentration in immature rats, but not in animals with regenerating adrenals. Both <b>orexins</b> raised metaphase index (%o of metaphase-arrested cells) in immature rat adrenals, orexin-B being more effective than orexin-A. In contrast, both <b>orexins</b> equipotently lowered adrenal metaphase index at day 5 (but not day 8) of adrenal regeneration. We conclude that <b>orexins</b> (1) stimulate secretion and proliferative activity of immature rat adrenals, acting through OX 1 R and OX 2 R, respectively; and (2) do not affect secretion, but inhibit proliferative activity of regenerating adrenals, mainly via the activation of OX 2 R...|$|R
40|$|Orexins-A and B are two novel {{hypothalamic}} peptides, which, like leptin and neuropeptide-Y (NPY), {{are involved}} in the central regulation of feeding. Since leptin and NPY were found to modulate adrenal function, we have examined whether <b>orexins</b> are able to directly affect rat adrenal steroid secretion. Both orexin-A and orexin-B raised basal corticosterone secretion of dispersed rat zona fasciculata-reticularis (ZF/R) cells, their maximal effective concentration being 10 (- 8) M. In contrast, <b>orexins</b> did not affect either maximally ACTH (10 (- 9) M) -stimulated corticosterone production by ZF/R cells or the basal and agonist-stimulated aldosterone secretion of dispersed zona glomerulosa cells. The ACTH-receptor antagonist corticotropin-inhibiting peptide (10 (- 6) M) annulled corticosterone response of ZF/R cells to ACTH (10 (- 9) M), but not to <b>orexins</b> (10 (- 8) M). <b>Orexins</b> (10 (- 8) M) enhanced cyclic-AMP release by ZF/R cells, and the selective inhibitor of protein-kinase A (PKA) H- 89 (10 (- 5) M) abolished corticosterone responses to both ACTH (10 (- 9) M) and <b>orexins</b> (10 (- 8) M). A subcutaneous injection of both <b>orexins</b> (5 or 10 nmol/kg) evoked a clear-cut increase in the plasma concentration of corticosterone (but not aldosterone), the effect of orexin-A being significantly more intense than that of orexin-B. Collectively, these findings suggest that <b>orexins</b> exert a selective and direct glucocorticoid secretagogue action on the rat adrenals, acting through a receptor-mediated activation of the adenylate cyclase/PKA-dependent signaling pathway...|$|R

25|$|Measuring <b>orexin</b> {{levels in}} a person's {{cerebrospinal}} fluid sampled in a spinal tap may help in diagnosing narcolepsy, with abnormally low levels {{serving as an}} indicator of the disorder. This test can be useful when MSLT results are inconclusive or difficult to interpret.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{cause of}} {{narcolepsy}} is unknown, {{and it may}} be caused by several distinct factors. Part of the mechanism involves the loss of orexin-releasing neurons within the lateral hypothalamus. In up to 10% of cases there is a family history of the disorder. There is a strong link with certain genetic variants. In addition to genetic factors, low levels of <b>orexin</b> peptides have been correlated with a past history of infection, diet, contact with toxins such as pesticides, and brain injuries due to brain tumors or strokes.|$|E
25|$|However, “there is no {{evidence}} that the pathophysiology or therapeutic response is substantially different for hypersomnia with or without SOREMPs on the MSLT.” Given this currently understood overlap of idiopathic hypersomnia and narcolepsy, the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) is also updating its classification of the primary hypersomnias. It reclassifies narcolepsy without cataplexy as major somnolence disorder (MSD). Additionally, MSD will encompass all syndromes of hypersomnolence not explained by low <b>orexin</b> concentrations, including idiopathic hypersomnia (with and without long sleep time) and long sleepers (people requiring >10hours sleep/day).|$|E

40|$|<b>Orexins</b> A and B are two {{hypothalamic}} peptides, {{involved in}} the control of feeding. We have investigated {{the effects of a}} bolus subcutaneous injection of 10 nmol/kg body weight of <b>orexins</b> on pituitary-adrenocortical function in both normal and ether- or cold-stressed rats. The blood concentrations of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), aldosterone and corticosterone were measured by specific radioimmune assay 60 and 120 min after the injection. In non-stressed rats, orexin-A raised the blood levels of the three hormones significantly at 60 min, and orexin-B increased aldosterone and corticosterone concentration significantly at 60 min without affecting that of ACTH. Orexin-A did not affect the pituitary-adrenocortical response to ether stress, while orexin-B increased ACTH and corticosterone responses significantly at 120 and 60 min respectively. Both <b>orexins</b> magnified the ACTH response to cold stress significantly, without altering aldosterone or corticosterone blood concentrations. We conclude that <b>orexins</b> (i) evoke a transient activation of the rat pituitary-adrenocortical axis, acting on both its central and peripheral branch; and (ii) exert a minor modulatory role on pituitary-adrenocortical responses to stresses, their effects being dependent upon the type of stressor...|$|R

25|$|The exact {{cause of}} {{narcolepsy}} is unknown with potentially several causes. In up to 10% of cases {{there is a}} family history of the disorder. Often those affected have low levels of the neuropeptide <b>orexin</b> which may be due to an autoimmune disorder. Trauma, infections, toxins, or psychological stress may also play a role. Diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms and sleep studies, after ruling out other potential causes. Excessive daytime sleepiness can also be caused by other sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, major depressive disorder, anemia, heart failure, drinking alcohol, and not getting enough sleep. Cataplexy may be mistaken for seizures.|$|E
25|$|Neural {{circuits}} in {{the brain}} stem are able to control acceptance or rejection of sweet or bitter foods, and can be modulated by satiation or physiological hunger signals. Signals from the tongue, stomach, small intestine and liver are received by the area postrema and nucleus of the solitary tract, which then send information to many regions of the forebrain that control food intake. The lateral hypothalamus contains two sets of neurons that increase eating and decrease metabolic rate by secreting the peptides <b>orexin</b> and melanin concentrating hormone (MCH). Neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the lateral hypothalamus induces ravenous eating; neurons that secrete NPY are targeted by ghrelin in the hypothalamus. Leptin desensitizes the brain to hunger signals and inhibits NPY-secreting neurons.|$|E

2500|$|The {{system which}} regulates sleep, arousal, and {{transitions}} between these states in humans {{is composed of}} three interconnected subsystems: the <b>orexin</b> projections from the lateral hypothalamus, the reticular activating system, and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus. [...] In narcoleptic individuals, these systems are all associated with impairments due to a greatly reduced number of hypothalamic <b>orexin</b> projection neurons and significantly fewer <b>orexin</b> neuropeptides in cerebrospinal fluid and neural tissue, compared to non-narcoleptic individuals. Those with narcolepsy generally experience the REM stage of sleep within fiveminutes of falling asleep, while {{people who do not}} have narcolepsy (unless they are significantly sleep deprived) do not experience REM until after a period of slow-wave sleep, which lasts for about the first hour or so of a sleep cycle.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Orexin,</b> {{otherwise}} known as hypocretin, is a neuropeptide that acts within the brain to regulate appetite and wakefulness {{as well as a}} number of other cognitive and physiological processes. [...] While there are billions of cells in the human brain, only 10,000–20,000 neurons secrete <b>orexin</b> peptides; all of these neurons project out of the lateral hypothalamus. Loss of these orexin-producing neurons causes narcolepsy and most individuals with narcolepsy have a reduced number of these neurons in their brains.|$|E

The subsequent activation of the GIRK channel mediates hyperpolarization of <b>orexin</b> neurons, which regulate the release of many other neurotransmitters including noradrenaline and acetylcholine.|$|E
40|$|Menopause is {{a period}} of {{significant}} physiological changes that may be associated with increased body weight and obesity-related diseases. Many researches were conducted to assess the contribution of factors such as estrogen depletion, REE decline, and aging to weight gain.

40|$|<b>Orexins</b> A and B are {{hypothalamic}} peptides, {{that act}} via two subtypes of receptors, named OX 1 -R and OX 2 -R. Rat and human adrenal cortexes {{are provided with}} both OX 1 -R and OX 2 -R, and we have previously shown that orexin-A, but not orexin-B, enhances glucocorticoid secretion from dispersed adrenocortical cells. Since OX 1 -Rs preferentially bind orexin-A and OX 2 -Rs are non-selective for both <b>orexins,</b> the hypothesis has been advanced that the secretagogue effect of orexin-A is exclusively mediated by the OX 1 -R. Here, we aimed to verify this contention and to gain insight into the signaling mechanism(s) underlying the secretagogue effect of <b>orexins</b> using primary cultures of rat and human adrenocortical cells. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that cultured cells, as freshly dispersed cells, expressed both OX 1 -R and OX 2 -R mRNAs. Orexin-A, but not orexin-B, concentration-dependently increased corticosterone and cortisol secretion from cultured rat and human adrenocortical cells, respectively. The blockade of OX 1 -Rs by selective antibodies abrogated the secretagogue effect of orexin-A, while the immuno-blockade of OX 2 -Rs was ineffective. The glucocorticoid response of cultured cells to orexin-A was annulled by the adenylate cyclase and protein kinase (PK) A inhibitors SQ- 22536 and H- 89, and unaffected by the phospholipase C and PKC inhibitors U- 73122 and calphostin-C. Orexin-A, but not orexin-B, enhanced cyclic-AMP production from cultured cells, and did not alter inositol- 3 -phosphate release.

2500|$|Further complicating these updated {{classification}} schemes, {{overlap between}} narcolepsy with cataplexy and idiopathic hypersomnia {{has also been}} reported. [...] A subgroup of narcoleptics with long sleep time, comprising 18% of narcoleptics in one study, had symptoms of both narcolepsy with cataplexy and idiopathic hypersomnia (long sleep time and unrefreshing naps).

40|$|<b>Orexins</b> (hypocretins) are a {{recently}} described set of hypothalamic peptides {{that have been}} implicated in feeding, neuroendocrine regulation and sleep-wakefulness.

Orexin-A immunoreactive fibres and their terminals were observed in the superficial dorsal horn. Neurokinin 1 receptor positive cells and their processes were also observed in lamina I of the dorsal horn. Although neurokinin 1 cells with orexin-A fibres were concentrated in the marginal layer of the dorsal horn, there was occasional direct anatomic contact between orexin-A and neurokinin 1 receptors in this region. The results of the present study suggest that the functions of the <b>orexins</b> and the neurokinin 1 receptor related to feeding, nociception, sensory information and neuroendocrine functions are possibly mediated via dependent mechanisms.

40|$|Leptin, {{the product}} of the ob gene, is a satiety factor {{secreted}} mainly in adipose tissue and is part of a signaling mechanism regulating the content of body fat. It acts on leptin receptors, most of which are located in the hypothalamus, a region of the brain known to control body homeostasis. The fastest and strongest hypothalamic response to leptin in ob/ob mice occurs in the paraventricular nucleus, which is involved in neuroendocrine and autonomic functions. On the other hand, <b>orexins</b> (orexin-A and-B) or hypocretins (hypocretin- 1 and- 2) were recently discovered in the hypothalamus, in which a number of neuropeptides are known to stimulate or suppress food intake.

40|$|<b>Orexins</b> A and B are {{hypothalamic}} peptides, which act {{through two}} receptor subtypes, called OX 1 R and OX 2 R. They {{belong to a}} group of neuropeptides involved in the central regulation of food intake, members of which (neuropeptide Y and leptin) are known to modulate the function of the pituitary-adrenocortical axis (PAA). We examined the effects at 60 and 120 min of a subcutaneous injection of 5 or 10 nmol/kg of <b>orexins</b> on the function of the rat PAA. Orexin-A raised plasma concentrations of ACTH, aldosterone and corticosterone at both 60 and 120 min, corticosterone response being the most intense one. Orexin-B evoked a sizeable decrease in the plasma level of ACTH, without changing that of corticosterone. The effect of orexin-B on aldosterone plasma concentration was biphasic, the lower dose decreasing and the higher one increasing it at both 60 and 120 min. Evidence indicates that OX 1 R binds both <b>orexins,</b> while OX 2 R is selective for orexin-B, and that only OX 2 R is present in the hypothalamic nucleus paraventricularis. On these grounds, our findings allow us to conclude: (i) OX 1 R stimulates and OX 2 R inhibits rat PAA; (ii) orexin-A stimulates PAA, the activation of OX 1 R prevailing over that of OX 2 R, while orexin-B suppresses PAA function; and (iii) the aldosterone-secreting response to the higher dose of orexin-B may probably be ascribed to the activation of one or more extra-PAA mechanisms enhancing secretory activity of the zona glomerulosa...|$|R

2500|$|According to the activation-synthesis {{hypothesis}} {{proposed by}} Robert McCarley and Allan Hobson in 1975–1977, control over REM sleep involves pathways of [...] "REM-on" [...] and [...] "REM-off" [...] neurons {{in the brain}} stem. REM-on neurons are primarily cholinergic (i.e., involve acetylcholine); REM-off neurons activate serotonin and noradrenaline, which among other functions suppress the REM-on neurons. McCarley and Hobson suggested that the REM-on neurons actually stimulate REM-off neurons, thereby serving as the mechanism for the cycling between REM and non-REM sleep. They used Lotka–Volterra equations to describe this cyclical inverse relationship. [...] Kayuza Sakai and Michel Jouvet advanced a similar model in 1981. Whereas acetylcholine manifests in the cortex equally during wakefulness and REM, it appears in higher concentrations in the brain stem during REM.
