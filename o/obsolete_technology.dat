25|$|By the 1960s {{production}} of gas from coal was an <b>obsolete</b> <b>technology.</b> By 1963 the Geelong Gas Company had changed production methods, using an Onia Gegi reforming plant to convert hydrocarbon gases from the Shell oil refinery at Corio into town gas. The new reforming plant was visited by many other gas companies {{as an example}} of modern Syngas technology. The former coal carbonising equipment was only used when coke (a by-product of the gasification process) was required.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, {{technology}} obsolescence has become an increasingly common feature of the global economy, often precipitated by new technological breakthroughs and innovations. Although {{a number of companies}} persist with <b>obsolete</b> <b>technologies</b> until disaster strikes, our understanding of the dynamics of technology obsolescence and why some firms persist with <b>obsolete</b> <b>technologies</b> remains largely underexplored. This conceptual paper seeks to fills these gaps in our understanding by developing a four-domain framework to explicate the dynamics of technologies' obsolescence, which takes into account the components in determining different types of obsolescence. The framework articulates two types of life-cycle match and two types of life-cycle mismatch. The article also contributes to the literature by delineating an integrated framework of firm-specific and market-based factors which account for some firms' persistence with <b>obsolete</b> <b>technologies.</b> Amassing and utilising the latest information to update their technologies can help firms enhance their competitiveness. The wider implications of the analysis for public policy and directions for future research are examined...|$|R

25|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} is {{a technology}} {{used to produce}} enriched uranium by forcing gaseous uranium hexafluoride (hex) through semi-permeable membranes. This produces a slight separation between the molecules containing 235U and 238U. Throughout the Cold War, gaseous diffusion {{played a major role}} as a uranium enrichment technique, and as of 2008 accounted for about 33% of enriched uranium production, but in 2011 was deemed an <b>obsolete</b> <b>technology</b> that is steadily being replaced by the later generations of technology as the diffusion plants reach their ends-of-life. In 2013, the Paducah facility in the US ceased operating, it was the last commercial 235U gaseous diffusion plant in the world.|$|E
25|$|Although {{originally}} {{conceived as}} a one-dimensional, recurring villain who might occasionally enter the Simpsons' lives and wreak some sort of havoc, Mr. Burns' popularity has led to his repeated inclusion in episodes. He is a stereotype of corporate America in his unquenchable desire to increase his own wealth and power, inability to remember his employees' names (including Homer's, despite frequent interactions– {{which has become a}} recurrent joke) and lack of concern for their safety and well-being. Reflecting his advanced age, Mr. Burns is given to expressing dated humor, making references to Jazz Age popular culture, and aspiring to apply <b>obsolete</b> <b>technology</b> to everyday life. Conan O'Brien has called Mr. Burns his favorite character to write for, due to his arbitrarily old age and extreme wealth.|$|E

2500|$|Citing {{dissatisfaction with}} the {{aesthetics}} of modern digital displays and a nostalgic fondness for the styling of <b>obsolete</b> <b>technology,</b> significant numbers of electronics enthusiasts {{in recent years have}} shown interest in reviving Nixies. Unsold tubes that have been sitting in warehouses for decades are being brought out and used, the most common application being in homemade digital clocks. This is somewhat ironic, since during their heyday, Nixies were generally considered too expensive for use in mass-market consumer goods such as clocks. This recent surge in demand has caused prices to rise significantly, particularly for large tubes. The largest Nixie tubes known to {{be in the hands of}} collectors, the Rodan CD47/GR-414 (220mm [...] tall), have been sold for hundreds of dollars each, but said Nixies are extremely rare. Prices for other large Nixies displaying digits over 25mm (1in) tall have risen by double, triple or more between 1998 and 2005.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} and analyzes {{a growth}} model {{that consists of}} two types of vintage-specific capital: long-lived and short-lived capital. As {{a result of the}} existence of complementary capital that is chronologically compatible but has different longevity, the model generates two distinct investment patterns: (i) if the rate of the vintage-specific technological progress is above a threshold – which is the product of long-lived capital’s share and the difference in the rates of depreciation – then all new investment concentrates on the latest technology; (ii) otherwise, some investment is allocated to obsolete, short-lived capital to exploit existing excessive long-lived capital with <b>obsolete</b> <b>technologies.</b> The result provides a new explanation for observed investment in equipment with <b>obsolete</b> <b>technologies.</b> A striking implication is that equipment price-changes do not necessarily reflect the rate of technological progress. Another implication is that acceleration in the rate of technological progress can cause an abrupt reallocation of investment towards modern capital – consistent with investment booms that are concentrated in certain ”high-tech ” equipment. ∗I express my deep condolences for Gary Saxonhouse as his last student.

50|$|Because of {{its primary}} use of digital formats, new media art {{relies heavily on}} {{emulation}} as a preservation strategy. Artists such as Cory Arcangel specialize in resurrecting <b>obsolete</b> <b>technologies</b> in their artwork and {{recognize the importance of}} a decentralized and deinstitutionalized process for the preservation of digital culture. In many cases, the goal of emulation in new media art is to preserve a digital medium {{so that it can be}} saved indefinitely and reproduced without error, so that there is no reliance on hardware that ages and becomes obsolete. The paradox is that the emulation and the emulator have to be made to work on future computers.|$|R
