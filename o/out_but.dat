5|$|Australia had {{retained}} the Ashes, but England struck back at The Oval, where they posted the then-record Test score of 7/903. Early on, O'Reilly trapped Edrich lbw for 12, to secure his 100th Test wicket against England. In a timeless match, Len Hutton made {{a world record}} Test score of 364 in a fastidious and watchful innings of 13 hours, surpassing Bradman's 334. When he was on 333, O'Reilly deliberately bowled two no-balls {{in an attempt to}} break Hutton's concentration by tempting him to hit <b>out,</b> <b>but</b> the Englishman blocked them with a straight bat.|$|E

5|$|In November 1943, Landis agreed {{after some}} persuasion that black sportswriter Sam Lacy {{should make a}} case for {{integration}} of organized baseball before the owners' annual meeting. Instead of Lacy attending the meeting, actor Paul Robeson did. Robeson, though a noted black actor and advocate of civil rights, was a controversial figure due to his affiliation with the Communist Party. The owners heard Robeson <b>out,</b> <b>but</b> at Landis's suggestion, did not ask him any questions or begin any discussion with him.|$|E
5|$|In the 37th minute, Bahr took a {{long shot}} from twenty-five yards <b>out,</b> <b>but</b> as Williams moved to his right to intercept, Gaetjens dived headlong near the penalty spot, and grazed the ball enough to {{put it to the}} left of the English goalkeeper, whose {{momentum}} prevented him from changing direction, and into the back of the net. The crowd exploded as the U.S. improbably led 1–0. As the half drew to a close, Finney had a chance to equalize, but the whistle blew before he could shoot.|$|E

5|$|In the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál (chapter 57), the god Bragi {{explains}} {{the origin of}} poetry. Bragi says that it originated in the Æsir–Vanir War, when during the peace conference the Æsir and the Vanir formed a truce by all spitting into a vat. When they left, the gods decided {{that it should not}} be poured <b>out,</b> <b>but</b> rather kept as a symbol of their peace, and so from the contents made a man, Kvasir. Kvasir is later murdered, and from his blood is made the Mead of Poetry.|$|E

5|$|In {{the meeting}} Tecumseh warned Harrison {{that he would}} seek an {{alliance}} with the British if hostilities broke out.

As early as 1810, British agents had sought to secure an alliance with Native Americans to assist in the defense of Canada should hostilities break <b>out,</b> <b>but</b> the Natives had been reluctant to accept their offer, fearing they had little to benefit from such an arrangement.|$|E

5|$|Lasker {{followed}} Steinitz's principles, {{and both}} demonstrated {{a completely different}} chess paradigm than the “romantic” mentality before them.
