Surprisingly, {{little is known about}} the mechanisms regulating dopamine release at synapses. In this thesis, we study mechanisms that regulate vesicle recycling in axons and dendrites of dopamine neurons. Key questions we addressed were: (1) Are vesicles in axons and dendrites associated with the same regulatory proteins, and thus by implication the same regulatory mechanisms, as in excitatory neurons; (2) Do vesicles undergo recycling, and (3) if so, are they characterised by a distinct pool size and rate of recycling. To study this, we cultured dopamine neurons and used immunocytochemistry to detect vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT 2) and identify axons, dendrites and synaptic proteins, combined with labelling of recycling vesicles using FM 1 - 43. Vesicles in axons, but not in dendrites, were associated with presynaptic proteins such as Synaptophysin and Bassoon. We identified two kinds of presynaptic sites in axons: &# 145;synaptic&# 146; (located close to soma and dendrites&# 146; and &# 145;orphan&# 146;. The recycling vesicle pool size was smaller at <b>orphan</b> <b>sites</b> than at synaptic sites, and the initial rate of vesicle pool release was also lower at <b>orphan</b> <b>sites.</b> Both synaptic and <b>orphan</b> <b>sites</b> exhibited lower rates of vesicle pool release compared to hippocampal synapses, suggesting functional differences in presynaptic physiology between dopamine neurons and hippocampal neurons. In somatodendritic regions, VMAT 2 was localised to the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, endosome, and large dense-core vesicles, suggesting that these vesicles might function as a part of the regulated secretory pathway in mediating dopamine release. None of the synaptic vesicle proteins we studied were detected in these regions, although some preliminary evidence of vesicle turnover was detected using FM 1 - 43 labelling. This thesis provides a detailed analysis of neurotransmitter release mechanisms in dopamine neurons. Our data suggests that presynaptic release of dopamine is mediated by mechanisms similar to those observed in excitatory neurons. In somatodendritic regions, our data suggests that VMAT 2 is localised to organelles in secretory pathways, and that distinct mechanisms of release might be present at somatodendritic sites to those present in presynaptic sites. This thesis provides novel methods for analysing vesicle recycling in dopamine neurons, which provides the basis for further studies examining presynaptic function of dopamine neurons in normal brain function, disease, and therapeutic approaches...|$|R

40|$|The Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB), SW Spain and Portugal, {{contains}} about 100 abandoned mine wastes and galleries that release acid mine drainages (AMD) to the Tinto and Odiel rivers. In situ passive remediation technologies are especially suitable to remediate the drainages of these <b>orphan</b> <b>sites.</b> However, traditional remediation systems, designed for coal mines, {{have been demonstrated}} inefficient to treat the IPB mine waters. Due to their high acidity and metal loads, large amount of solids precipitate and fast clogging of porosity or passivation (coating) of the reactive grains occurs. To overcome these problems, the dispersed alkaline substrate (DAS) a mixture of fine-grained limestone sand and a coarse inert matrix (e. g., wood shavings) was developed. The small grains provide a large reactive surface and dissolve almost completely before the growing layer of precipitates passivates the substrate. The high porosity retards clogging. However, calcite dissolution only raises pH to values around 6. 5, at which the hydroxides of trivalent metals (Al and Fe) precipitate, {{but it is not}} high enough to remove divalent metals. Caustic magnesia (MgO) buffers the solution pH between 8. 5 and 10.

40|$|Abandoned tailing basins {{and waste}} heaps of <b>orphan</b> mining <b>sites</b> are {{of great concern}} since extreme metal {{contamination}} makes soil improper for any human activity and is a permanent threat for nearby surroundings. Although spontaneous revegetation can occur, the process is slow or unsuccessful and rhizostabilisation strategies to reduce dispersal of contaminated dust represent an option to rehabilitate such sites. This requires selection of plants tolerant to such conditions, and optimization of their fitness and growth. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can enhance metal tolerance in moderately polluted soils, but their ability to survive extreme levels of metal contamination has not been reported. This question was addressed in the tailing basin and nearby waste heaps of an <b>orphan</b> mining <b>site</b> in southern France, reaching in the tailing basin exceptionally high contents of zinc (ppm: 97, 333 total) and lead (ppm: 31, 333 total). In order {{to contribute to a}} better understanding of AMF ecology under severe abiotic stress and to identify AMF associated with plants growing under such conditions, that may be considered in future revegetation and rhizostabilisation of highly polluted areas, nine plant species were sampled at different growing seasons and AMF root colonization was determined. Glomeromycota diversity was monitored in mycorrhizal roots by sequencing of the ribosomal LSU. This first survey of AMF in such highly contaminated soils revealed the presence of several AMF ribotypes, belonging mainly to the Glomerales, with some examples from the Paraglomerales and Diversisporales. AMF diversity and root colonization in the tailing basin were lower than in the less-contaminated waste heaps. A Paraglomus species previously identified in a polish mining site was common in roots of different plants. Presence of active AMF in such an environment is an outstanding finding, which should be clearly considered for the design of efficient rhizostabilisation processes...|$|R

There exist {{numerous}} small, 5 - 20 m² eroded areas, {{which are}} typically along roadsides, behind businesses or on abandoned areas. A good name for {{these areas are}} ‘orphan’ sites because they are hard to manage and few people care about them. These sites have little likelihood of revegetation without input. Reclaiming these small areas is a challenge due to very low soil pH, high P fixation capacity, sometimes high slope, exposed saprolite and lack of soil structure. The objective of this work is to enlist local schools, civic groups and environmental organizations to locate <b>orphan</b> <b>sites,</b> offer advice how to proceed, and provide materials such as lime, seed, hand tools, rip-rap and wheatstraw. Preference is given to eroded areas near watercourses. This project was {{paid for by the}} Newland Family Foundation with assistance from the Sierra Club Foundation, and has been in progress for about 5 years and will continue into the future.

40|$|AbstractWhether contact of an axon with a {{dendrite}} is {{a necessary}} inductive signal for the assembly of functional presynaptic machinery is controversial. Combining FM 1 - 43 imaging with retrospective immunocytochemistry, we observe many functional synaptic vesicle (SV) release sites lacking postsynaptic specializations in cultured hippocampal neurons. These “orphan” release sites share the same exocytic machinery and mechanisms of endocytic recycling as mature synaptic sites. Moreover, quantitative analysis of FM 1 - 43 destaining at these <b>orphan</b> release <b>sites</b> reveals similar kinetics with slightly lower release probabilities. Time-lapse imaging of FM 1 - 43 reveals that orphans are generated by complete or partial mobilization of synaptic release sites that retain their functionality in transit. Orphan clusters fuse with existing synaptic release sites or form novel release sites onto dendrites. Mobilization and stabilization of orphan boutons to new sites of dendritic contact may represent a necessary presynaptic counterpart to postsynaptic changes observed during development and plasticity in the CNS...|$|R

The watershed consists of 13, 600 acres, which are National Forest Lands. Approximately 600 acres in the watershed are patented mining claims. Gold was discovered in Lynx Creek in 1863 and the watershed was extensively mined for gold, silver and copper. The aftermath of the mining has resulted in numerous mine shafts, waste dumps and mill tailing ponds that were abandoned after the ore was played out. Drainage from the <b>orphaned</b> mine <b>sites</b> contribute a certain extent of toxic mineral and sediment pollution into Lynx Creek and eventually into Lynx Lake.

40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that COUP-TFII and Ear- 2, {{two members of}} the nuclear orphan receptor family, are able to repress oestrogen-stimulated transcriptional activity of the human oxytocin (OT) gene promoter by binding to a site that overlaps with the oestrogen response element (ERE) present in the 5 * flanking region of the gene. Although most nuclear receptor-mediated transcriptional repres-sion conforms with the paradigm of passive repression and involves competitive binding to an activator site, active repression, i. e. silencing of basal promoter activity, has been observed in a limited number of cases. Here we show by co-transfection experiments using COUP-TFII and Ear- 2 expression vectors and reporter constructs containing OT gene promoter fragments linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene that both COUP-TFII and Ear- 2 are capable of silencing basal OT gene promoter activity by 54 and 75 % respectively. 5 * Deletion and footprint analyses revealed two areas of functionally important interaction sites: (1) a direct TGACC(T/C) repeat overlapping the ERE and (2) a more promoter-proximal area centred at " 90 containing three imperfect direct repeats (R 1 –R 3) spaced by four nucleotides each. Mutagenesis of reporter con-structs as well as electrophoretic mobility-shift assays demonstrated that each of the three proximal repeats R 1 –R 3 contributed to orphan receptor binding and the silencing eVect. Inasmuch as the <b>orphan</b> receptor-binding <b>sites</b> are not involved in mediating basal transcriptional activity of the OT gene promoter, the observed eVects are best interpreted as active repression or promoter silenc-ing.

In hamsters housed in a long-day photoperiod, late-afternoon RAM treatment inhibited gonadotropin secretion, induced gonadal regression, and suppressed food intake and body mass, mimicking effects of MEL. In addition, chronic (24 h/d) RAM infusions were sufficient to obscure endogenous MEL signaling, and these treatments attenuated gonadal regression in short days. Together, the outcomes indicate that signaling at the MT 1 receptor is sufficient and necessary to mediate the effects of photoperiod-driven changes in MEL on behavior and reproductive function in a reproductively photoperiodic mammal...|$|R

These isotopic data also provide information on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), notably {{with regard to the}} intensity of the Western Boundary Under Current (WBUC), which is tightly controlled by the production of Denmark Strait Overflow Water (DSOW), and the production of Labrador Sea Water (LSW) in the inner basin through winter cooling and convection. The upper 184 m of sediment at Eirik Ridge spans marine isotope stages (MIS) 32 to 1. At this site, two distinct regimes are observed: prior to MIS 20, the isotopic record resembles that of the open North Atlantic records of the interval, whereas a more site-specific pattern is observed afterwards. This later pattern was characterized by i) high DSOW production rates and strong WBUC during interglacial stages, as indicated by sedimentation rates, ii) large amplitude d 18 O-shifts from glacial stages to interglacial stages (> 2. 5 per mil) and iii) an overall range of d 18 O-values significantly more positive than before. At Orphan Knoll, the 105 m record spans approximately 800 ka and provides direct information on linkages between the northeastern sector of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and the North Atlantic. At this site, a shift towards larger amplitude glacial/interglacial ranges of d 18 O-values occurred after MIS 13, although isotopic records bear a typical North Atlantic signature, particularly during MIS 5, in contradiction to those of Eirik Ridge, where substages 5 a to 5 c are barely recognized. Closer examination of d 18 O-records in planktic and benthic foraminifera demonstrates the presence of distinct deep-water masses in the inner vs. outer LS basins during MIS 11 and more particularly MIS 5 e.

40|$|Elucidation {{of factors}} {{regulating}} glucocorticoid (GC) sensitivity {{is required for}} the development of “steroid-sparing” therapies for chronic inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Accumulating evidence suggests that macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) counterregulates the GC-induction of anti-inflammatory mediators, including mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP 1), a critical mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling inhibitor. This observation has yet to be extended to human disease; the molecular mechanisms remain unknown. We investigated NURR 1, a GC-responsive transcription factor overexpressed in RA, as a MIF signaling target. We reveal abrogation by recombinant MIF (rMIF) of GC-induced MKP 1 expression in RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). rMIF enhanced NURR 1 expression, artificial NBRE (<b>orphan</b> receptor DNA-binding <b>site)</b> reporter transactivation, and reversed GC-inhibition of NURR 1. NURR 1 expression was reduced during experimental arthritis in MIF−/− synovium, and silencing MIF reduced RA FLS NURR 1 mRNA. Consistent with NBRE identification on the MKP 1 gene, MKP 1 mRNA was reduced in FLS that ectopically express NURR 1, and silencing NURR 1 enhanced MKP 1 mRNA in RA FLS. rMIF enhanced NBRE binding on the MKP 1 gene, and the absence of the NBRE prevented NURR 1 -repressive effects on basal and GC-induced MKP 1 transactivation. This study defines NURR 1 as a novel MIF target in chronic inflammation and demonstrates a role for NURR 1 in regulating the anti-inflammatory mediator, MKP 1.

40|$|The tumor {{suppressor}} p 53 controls {{cell proliferation}} and protects against carcinogenesis {{through a combination}} of transcriptional activation, repression and direct activation of the intrinsic cell death pathway. p 53 is lost or functionally inactivated in nearly of human tumors. Because of its crucial tumor suppressor activity, p 53 is an appealing target for pharmacological intervention in cancer treatment. One of emerging approaches to modulate the tumor suppressor activity of p 53 is to explore its tendency to form complexes with other transcription factors and proteins. Historically, targeting protein-protein interactions as potential intervention points for developing therapeutic agents for cancer therapy was perceived to be unattractive, but recent success in identifying of small molecule drug-like antagonists lends support for protein-protein interactions as potential targets for anti-cancer drug discovery. ^ The overriding goal of this thesis was to understand how protein-protein interactions affect p 53 function in order to explore p 53 and its complexes as targets for intervention in cancer chemotherapy. Two interacting partners of p 53 were examined in order to evaluate: I) stabilization as an approach for functional rescue of mutant p 53; and 2) antagonism to inhibit co-transcriptional activation of an oncogene. ^ Our first approach was to design a drug-like molecule from an interaction where the interfaces of two interacting proteins were known at atomic resolution. Rationally designing a drug based on known structure and function seemed reasonable, but our experience indicates that rational design can become irrational. Because of a lack of atomic resolution structure or accurate biophysical probes for the protein ligand interaction, it is hard to identify whether the ligand binds to the same place that the parental protein binds. However, this study led to the identification of a novel <b>orphan</b> binding <b>site</b> that may be useful as a potential target for drug discovery. ^ By studying the interaction interfaces of the oligomeric proteins p 53 and TFAP 2, we have confronted the conventional wisdom {{that it is difficult to}} antagonize protein-protein interactions with small molecules, because the affinity of protein-ligand interactions is often overwhelmed by the avidity of protein-protein interactions. However, our work shows convincingly that modulating post-translational modifications offers an alternative approach to inhibit even protein-protein interactions that exploit avidity to generate substantial binding affinity. This finding rationalizes the uses of pharmacological agents that modulate post-translational modifications in combination with current treatments for cancer patients, and suggests that protein-protein interactions remain viable targets for pharmacologic intervention in disease. ...|$|R

These included highly conserved Otx 2 and ROR (retinoic acid receptor related <b>orphan</b> receptor) binding <b>sites.</b> The other required sequences {{do not appear to be}} controlled by Otx 2 or ROR factors, increasing the complexity of the Blimp 1 gene regulatory network. Our results show that the intersection of three or more transcription factors is required to correctly regulate the spatial and temporal features of Blimp 1 enhancer expression. This explains how Blimp 1 expression can diverge from Otx 2 and set the balance between photoreceptor and bipolar fates...|$|R
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comTranscriptional activation of the gene coding for the neuropeptide hormone oxytocin by oestrogens does not follow the classical model of oestrogen receptor action. The oxytocin promoter does not contain an oestrogen response element (ERE), but instead a high-affinity binding <b>site</b> for nuclear <b>orphan</b> receptors. In the present study, the oestrogen-dependent up-regulation of the bovine oxytocin promoter is investigated in MDA-MB 231 cells. Control by oestrogen is shown {{to be dependent on}} the integrity of the nuclear <b>orphan</b> receptor binding <b>site</b> and the presence of ligand-activated oestrogen receptor, but independent of oestrogen receptor binding to DNA. Partial agonists tamoxifen and raloxifen and the pure antagonist ICI 182 780 all show agonistic activities on transcription, while exhibiting normal binding affinities to oestrogen receptor (ER) alpha. Nuclear orphan receptors oestrogen receptor-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha) and germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF) are expressed to significant levels in MDA-MB 231 cells. Binding of ERRalpha to the oxytocin promoter binding site can be demonstrated, suggesting the involvement of this nuclear orphan receptor in oestrogen-dependent up-regulation. The oestrogenic stimulation of the oxytocin promoter apparently is dependent on the stimulation of the transcriptional activity of this nuclear orphan receptor by ERK- 1 /ERK- 2 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases). This novel nonclassical mechanism of oestrogen action most probably is not restricted to the regulation of neuropeptide hormone expression, but may further contribute to the multitude of tissue-specific effects of oestrogenic substances.
