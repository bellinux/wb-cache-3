6000|$|They were in {{the elder}} Widgett girl's bedroom; Hetty was laid up, she said, with a sprained ankle, and a {{miscellaneous}} party was gossiping away her tedium. It was a large, littered, self-forgetful apartment, decorated with unframed charcoal sketches by various incipient masters; and an <b>open</b> <b>bookcase,</b> surmounted by plaster casts and the half of a human skull, displayed an odd miscellany of books--Shaw and Swinburne, Tom Jones, Fabian Essays, Pope and Dumas, cheek by jowl. Constance Widgett's abundant copper-red hair was bent down over some dimly remunerative work--stencilling in colors upon rough, white material--at a kitchen table she had dragged up-stairs for the purpose, while on her bed there was seated a slender lady of thirty or so in a dingy green dress, whom Constance had introduced {{with a wave of}} her hand as Miss Miniver. Miss Miniver looked out on the world through large emotional blue eyes that were further magnified by the glasses she wore, and her nose was pinched and pink, and her mouth was whimsically petulant. Her glasses moved quickly as her glance travelled from face to face. She seemed bursting with the desire to talk, and watching for her opportunity. On her lapel was an ivory button, bearing the words [...] "Votes for Women." [...] Ann Veronica sat {{at the foot of the}} sufferer's bed, while Teddy Widgett, being something of an athlete, occupied the only bed-room chair--a decadent piece, essentially a tripod and largely a formality--and smoked cigarettes, and tried to conceal the fact that he was looking all the time at Ann Veronica's eyebrows. Teddy was the hatless young man who had turned Ann Veronica aside from the Avenue two days before. He was the junior of both his sisters, co-educated and much broken in to feminine society. A bowl of roses, just brought by Ann Veronica, adorned the communal dressing-table, and Ann Veronica was particularly trim in preparation for a call she was to make with her aunt later in the afternoon.|$|E
50|$|The {{resulting}} designs {{followed the}} English model, but differed in its more {{extensive use of}} asymmetry, which had been a growing aspect of English furniture since the work of Edward William Godwin had become popular. He often used asymmetry to advantage, for example combining several pieces of furniture into one unit, such as an <b>open</b> <b>bookcase</b> over a slant-front desk mounted on a chest of drawers flanked on one side by a low cupboard.|$|E
50|$|<b>Open</b> <b>bookcases</b> are {{financed by}} {{a wide range of}} organisations (individuals, foundations, Lions Clubs, civic associations, and so on). Visitors to the bookcases decide which books to deposit and borrow, and whether to return or {{exchange}} borrowed books for others.|$|R

6000|$|Bruno took a {{very small}} book out of the <b>bookcase,</b> <b>opened</b> it, and shook it in {{imitation}} of the Professor. [...] "He isn't here," [...] he said.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} pictorial {{record of}} a natural history cabinet is the engraving in Ferrante Imperato's Dell'Historia Naturale (Naples 1599) (illustration, left). It serves to authenticate its author's credibility {{as a source of}} natural history information, in showing his <b>open</b> <b>bookcases</b> at the right, in which many volumes are stored lying down and stacked, in the medieval fashion, or with their spines upward, to protect the pages from dust. Some of the volumes doubtless represent his herbarium. Every surface of the vaulted ceiling is occupied with preserved fishes, stuffed mammals and curious shells, with a stuffed crocodile suspended in the centre. Examples of corals stand on the bookcases. At the left, the room is fitted out like a studiolo with a range of built-in cabinets whose fronts can be unlocked and let down to reveal intricately fitted nests of pigeonholes forming architectural units, filled with small mineral specimens. Above them, stuffed birds stand against panels inlaid with square polished stone samples, doubtless marbles and jaspers or fitted with pigeonhole compartments for specimens. Below them, a range of cupboards contain specimen boxes and covered jars.|$|R
2500|$|The {{player can}} add {{letters to the}} word [...] "GREED" [...] by hitting the {{bookcase}} {{in front of the}} vault. [...] Spelling [...] "GREED" [...] <b>opens</b> the <b>bookcase,</b> revealing a shot into the vault {{that can be used to}} [...] "lock" [...] (hold) balls for multiball; for the first multiball, the swamp can also be used to lock balls. [...] The Power turns on for the player's attempt to lock the third and final ball. [...] Multiball can be started from the vault or, for the first multiball, the electric chair.|$|R
50|$|In several stories, {{a secret}} area is {{hidden behind a}} {{bookcase}} built into the wall. The entrance is typically opened when a particular book on the shelf is pulled off or uses a switch in a statue, usually under the head. One particularly humorous example {{is found in the}} film Young Frankenstein, when Doctor Frankenstein's laboratory is <b>opened</b> via a <b>bookcase</b> triggered by a candle.|$|R
5000|$|In 2002, the Bonn Community Foundation awarded Trixy Royeck {{funding for}} her idea [...] "outdoor books - {{books in the}} open" [...] which she {{submitted}} while studying interior design in Mainz and since this time the concept has been widely replicated. A public <b>bookcase</b> <b>opened</b> in 2010 in Vienna, Austria. In Basel, Switzerland, where many coffee shops and other venues host open bookshelves, a public bookcase was unveiled in June 2011.|$|R
5000|$|According to Odesser, he {{succumbed to}} cravings during the fast of the Seventeenth of Tammuz and he ate something. He was {{severely}} distraught as a result. For six days he suffered intensely {{and felt like}} a dead man. He prayed and had a [...] "powerful thought enter his mind" [...] to [...] "Go to your room and <b>open</b> the <b>bookcase,</b> and put your hand and any book…and open it to wherever it opens…and there you will find good things that will enable you to revive yourself; there {{you will find a}} healing for your soul!" [...] Acting on this thought, he chose a book, opened it, and found a letter inside containing words of greeting and encouragement, along with a phrase in the Hebrew language based on the four letters of the name Nachman (i.e., Rebbe Nachman of Breslov), added one letter at a time, in a Kabbalistic achorayim form.|$|R
50|$|A lesser-known {{fact about}} the Long Room is that, above the bay, between its ceiling {{and the room}} above, exists {{one of the two}} {{remaining}} priest holes or hiding places, dating back to the house's time as a private residence in the period of Recusancy, when Jesuits and other Catholic priests were hunted by the authorities. The other hiding place is in the gatehouse, approached up a false chimney. Another was located in the Duchess' Rooms before they were pulled down {{to make way for the}} Arundell Library wing; it was hidden behind a <b>bookcase,</b> <b>opened</b> by a secret spring. A fourth was under a flagstone in the original washing place, and a further hidden behind a false beam nearby.|$|R
60|$|She was {{convinced}} that had there been a spring in the room itself she must have discovered it, but it never before struck her {{that it might be}} {{at the back of the}} closet. She felt that she must satisfy herself on this point whatever the risk of discovery. Accordingly at the usual hour she made her way downstairs. She had put the key in the door, and was in the act of turning it when she heard a noise upstairs. She opened the door and stood looking up the stairs. In a moment she saw a light, and directly afterward Miss Penfold appeared at the top holding a candle in her hand. Knowing she was as yet unseen, Mrs. Conway entered the library and closed the door behind her. Then she hurried to the fireplace, touched the two springs, pulled the <b>bookcase</b> <b>open</b> and entered the secret chamber, and closed the bookcase behind her.|$|R
500|$|Stephen {{begins to}} dress in {{masculine}} clothes made by a tailor rather than a dressmaker. At twenty-one she {{falls in love with}} Angela Crossby, the American wife of a new neighbour. Angela uses Stephen as an [...] "anodyne against boredom", allowing her [...] "a few rather schoolgirlish kisses". Then Stephen discovers that Angela is {{having an affair with a}} man. Fearing exposure, Angela shows a letter from Stephen to her husband, who sends a copy to Stephen's mother. Lady Anna denounces Stephen for [...] "presum to use the word love in connection with...these unnatural cravings of your unbalanced mind and undisciplined body." [...] Stephen replies, [...] "As my father loved you, I loved...It was good, good, good– I'd have laid down my life a thousand times over for Angela Crossby." [...] After the argument, Stephen goes to her father's study and for the first time <b>opens</b> his locked <b>bookcase.</b> She finds a book by Krafft-Ebing– assumed by critics to be Psychopathia Sexualis, a text about homosexuality and paraphilias– and, reading it, learns that she is an invert.|$|R
60|$|It {{took her}} another {{three weeks before}} she found this. It was a slight projection, about {{as large as a}} button, in the inside of the chimney behind the mantel. Pressing this and the other spring simultaneously, the {{bookcase}} on the left of the fireplace suddenly swung open three or four inches. For a moment she stood breathless with excitement, hesitating before she entered; then she swung the <b>bookcase</b> <b>open.</b> There, as she had expected, was a little room seven feet long by four deep; but, to her bitter disappointment, it was bare and empty. A few scraps of paper lay on the ground, but there was no furniture, chest, or boxes in the room. The revulsion was so great that Mrs. Conway returned into the library, threw herself into a chair, and had a long cry. Then she went back into the room and carefully examined the pieces of paper lying on the ground. One of them was a portion of a letter, and she recognized at once the handwriting of Mr. Tallboys.|$|R
40|$|With {{increasing}} numbers of children enrolled in child care, {{the safety of the}} child care environment and the preparedness of personnel to prevent injuries and fatalities in the event of natural disasters becomes an important public policy issue. In this study, earthquake preparedness and its correlates were examined in 25 child care centers located in a southern California community adjacent to the San Andreaas Fault. Extensive survey, interview, and on-site observational data were collected. Findings indicated a wide range of preparedness in child care centers. Half of the child care centers lacked basic essentials required to cope {{in the aftermath of a}} major quake. Several hazards were also common: unsecured <b>bookcases,</b> <b>open</b> shelves, rolling furniture, large and unprotected windows, and heavy objects stored on high shelves. In addition, many directors had misconceptions about the role of local agencies (e. g., fire department, police, Red Cross) following an earthquake. Findings are considered in terms of risk assessment theory and implications; public policy and legislative courses of action are discussed...|$|R

5000|$|Early on, Brice's {{character}} was sometimes called [...] "Babykins." [...] By 1934 {{she was wearing}} her baby costume while appearing on Broadway in the Follies show. On February 29, 1936, Brice was scheduled {{to appear on the}} Ziegfeld Follies of the Air, written and directed by Philip Rapp in 1935-37. Rapp and his writing partner David Freedman searched the closest <b>bookcase,</b> <b>opened</b> a public domain collection of sketches by Robert Jones Burdette, Chimes From a Jester’s Bells (1897) and adapted a humorous piece about a kid and his uncle, changing the boy to a girl named Snooks. Rapp continued to write the radio sketches when Brice played Snooks on the Good News Show the following year. In 1940, she became a regular character on Maxwell House Coffee Time, sharing the spotlight with actor Frank Morgan, who sometimes did a crossover into the Snooks sketches.In 1944, the {{character was}} given her own show, and during the 1940s, it became one of the nation's favorite radio situation comedies, with a variety of sponsors (Post Cereals, Sanka, Spic-n-Span, Jell-O) being touted by a half-dozen announcers—John Conte, Tobe Reed, Harlow Willcox, Dick Joy, Don Wilson and Ken Wilson.|$|R
6000|$|What's in a name?' laughed Herbert. 'But {{it really}} is a queer show-up of human oddity. A fellow comes in here, searching; that's all.' His back was turned, as he stood staring absently out, sipping his tea between his sentences. 'He comes in--oh, it's a {{positive}} fact, for I've seen him myself, just sitting back in my chair here, you know, watching him as one would a tramp in one's orchard.' He cast a candid glance over his shoulder. 'First he looks round, like a prying servant. Then he comes cautiously on--a kind of grizzled, fawn-coloured face, middle-size, with big hands; and then just like some quiet, groping, nocturnal creature, he begins his precious search--shelves, drawers that are not here, cupboards gone years ago, questing and nosing no end, and quite methodically too, until he reaches the window. Then he stops, looks back, narrows his foxy lids, listens--quite perceptibly, you know, a kind of gingerish blur; then he seems to <b>open</b> this corner <b>bookcase</b> here, {{as if it were a}} door and goes out along what I suppose might at some time have been an outside gallery or balcony, unless, as I rather fancy, the house extended once beyond these windows. Anyhow, out he goes quite deliberately, treading the air as lightly as Botticelli's angels, until, however far you lean out of the window, you can't follow him any further. And then--and this is the bit that takes one's fancy--when you have contentedly noddled down again to whatever you may have been doing when the wretch appeared, or are sitting in a cold sweat, with bolting eyes awaiting developments, just according to your school of thought, or of nerves, the creature comes back--comes back; and with what looks uncommonly like a lighted candle in his hand. That really is a thrill, I assure you.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Guests were {{admitted}} into Wayne Manor as Gotham City Police Cadets {{on a tour}} of the library. Guests were shown a short video detailing WayneTech's latest developments such as the Gotham City Security Network and the new reconnaissance fleet of aircraft, similarly styled to the Batwing in the 1989 film. This clip was introduced by the chief of the Wayne Foundation, Lucius Fox. Just as Mr. Fox started explaining the new network, they were interrupted by an alert directly from Arkham Asylum, Gotham City's maximum security facility for the city's worst felons. He remarked that it's [...] "probably a false alarm but it doesn't pay to take chances". Batgirl linked to the computer from the Batcave to find that all of Gotham's forces are converging on Arkham Asylum. The television screen would go blank. A guide would then <b>open</b> the secret <b>bookcase</b> revealing the Batcave entrance as you walk through the Batcave tunnel through to the grouping queues you may hear dripping water and murmurs of bats flying. As guests reach the end of the queue lines the guide announces [...] "I now present to you the Gotham City security network". At this moment several doors would open to reveal the network. It included 14 minor video monitors and one huge projection screen in the middle as well as Batman's controls in front of the screen. There was an animatronic Batman who talks in the Batcave sitting at the desk with his back facing the audience. Guests were seated in the audience and witness a second pre-show video introducing the mission to retrieve the Whitney diamond, stolen earlier from the Gotham Museum of Art. This was stolen earlier by Catwoman and is used to power a freeze cannon operated by Mr. Freeze.|$|R
6000|$|I {{would come}} back through the January mire or fog from Vincent Square {{to the door of}} 79, and reach it at last with a quite childish {{appreciation}} of the fact that its solid Georgian proportions and its fine brass furnishings belonged to MY home; I would use my latchkey and discover Margaret in the warm-lit, spacious hall with a partially opened packing-case, fatigued but happy, or go up to have tea with her out of the right tea things, [...] "come at last," [...] or be told to notice what was fresh there. It wasn't simply that I had never had a house before, but I had really never been, except in the most transitory way, in any house that was nearly so delightful as mine promised to be. Everything was fresh and bright, and softly and harmoniously toned. Downstairs we had a green dining-room with gleaming silver, dark oak, and English colour-prints; above was a large drawing-room that could be made still larger by throwing open folding doors, and it was all carefully done in greys and blues, for the most part with real Sheraton supplemented by Sheraton so skilfully imitated by an expert Margaret had discovered as to be indistinguishable except to a minute scrutiny. And for me, above this and next to my bedroom, there was a roomy study, with specially thick stair-carpet outside and thick carpets in the bedroom overhead and a big old desk for me to sit at and work between fire and window, and another desk specially made for me by that expert if I chose to stand and write, and <b>open</b> bookshelves and <b>bookcases</b> and every sort of convenient fitting. There were electric heaters beside the open fire, and everything was put for me to make tea at any time--electric kettle, infuser, biscuits and fresh butter, so that I could get up and work at any hour of the day or night. I could do no work in this apartment for a long time, I was so interested in the perfection of its arrangements. And when I brought in my books and papers from Vincent Square, Margaret seized upon all the really shabby volumes and had them re-bound in a fine official-looking leather.|$|R
