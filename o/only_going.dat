Commission officials, after visiting the base, decided to keep it open, but the 102d would still lose its planes, only this time they were <b>only</b> <b>going</b> to the 104th Fighter Wing, based at Barnes Municipal Airport.|$|E
5|$|Castro {{was known}} for his busy working hours, often <b>only</b> <b>going</b> to bed at 3 or 4 a.m. He {{preferred}} to meet foreign diplomats in these early hours, believing that they would be tired and he could gain the upper hand in negotiations. He described Ernest Hemingway as his favorite writer, and enjoyed reading but was uninterested in music. A sports fan, he also spent much of his time trying to keep fit, undertaking regular exercise. He took a great interest in gastronomy, as well as wine and whisky, and as Cuban leader was known to wander into his kitchen to discuss cookery with his chefs. Castro had a lifelong love of guns, and a preference for life in the countryside over the city.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{increased}} hardware capabilities, the team were able to increase both the content and graphical quality. With the aim of encouraging new players to buy the game, the overall difficulty was reduced compared to previous entries. After the unconventional gameplay of Gaiden, Mystery of the Emblem returned to the traditional gameplay used for Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light, in addition to continuing the story of Marth after focusing on different characters for Gaiden. Mystery of the Emblem was initially <b>only</b> <b>going</b> to include original story content, but after consideration, {{it was decided to}} include an upgraded version of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light for those who had not played the original. Another proposed plan was to split the release into two parts: a remake of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light and Mystery of the Emblem. Due to space limitations, some characters featured in the original version of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light needed to be cut. The romance between Marth and Caeda was introduced as a refined version of a similar plot featured in Gaiden. As with previous games set in Archanea, the series' titular Fire Emblem took the form of a shield inset with five magical gems. According to Kaga, Mystery of the Emblem was intended as the last major title to be set on the continent of Archanea.|$|E

5|$|Nomura {{worked on}} the {{character}} designs for the main cast. He was originally <b>only</b> <b>going</b> to work on Aya and Eve, but after seeing the settings for the other characters, he offered to design them too. The team wanted to emphasize the character's sexuality. As part of this, the team included a scene where Aya takes a shower. This {{was inspired by a}} similar scene in Parasite Eve II. When the title was being developed for PSP, the team's main challenge with the character was to make her look as realistic as possible while retaining her established physical traits. Using this new realism, the team wanted to portray the fear felt by humans when faced with such threats through Aya. Achieving this realism proved {{one of the most difficult}} aspects of development. Her alternate costumes were not a high priority for the team, so their artists had high creative freedom.|$|E
25|$|The BRAC 2005 {{commission}} {{originally planned}} to close Otis Air National Guard Base and dissolve the 101st. Locals {{argued that this}} would leave a huge gap in the national air defenses. BRAC officials, after visiting the base, decided to keep it open, but the 101st would still lose its planes, only this time they were <b>only</b> <b>going</b> to the 104th Fighter Wing, based at Barnes Municipal Airport, {{near the town of}} Westfield in western Massachusetts.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} is built of rose granite quarried in Ortonville, with many stones greater than 20tonnes in weight. The granite was originally <b>only</b> <b>going</b> {{to be used}} for the foundation of the building, with brick used for the upper portion. However, the public appreciated the appearance of the foundation so much that they lobbied for the entire building to be made of granite. This may be a reason for the significant cost overruns — it was originally expected to cost only $1.15million.|$|E

25|$|In addition, many land {{animals have}} adapted to living {{a major part of}} their life on the oceans. For instance, seabirds are a diverse group of birds that {{have adapted to}} a life mainly on the oceans. They feed on marine animals and spend most of their {{lifetime}} on water, many <b>only</b> <b>going</b> on land for breeding. Other birds that have adapted to oceans as their living space are penguins, seagulls and pelicans. Seven species of turtles, the sea turtles, also {{spend most of their time}} in the oceans.|$|E
25|$|The oldest rocks proved through {{boreholes}} {{to exist}} below London are the old, hard rocks of the Palaeozoic. These consist of Silurian mudstones and sandstones, generally overlain by Devonian strata which are largely of Old Red Sandstone. The Devonian rocks are absent {{in parts of}} South London. The Palaeozoic rocks dip southwards and are more than 1,000 metres below the English Channel. Above this is a 60-metre thick layer of impermeable Gault clays. These clays are relatively young, <b>only</b> <b>going</b> {{back to the early}} Cretaceous which began around 144 million years ago.|$|E

Buses were stopped because of security measures on the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Eastern Distributor off ramp, and passengers walked because traffic was not moving during the morning peak on Wednesday. However, so many Sydneysiders took time off or avoided the city that the regular peak hour traffic was greatly reduced.|$|E

Fator performed at Christian rock legend Larry Norman's 60th birthday party in April 2007.

25|$|The series first {{appeared}} in Shogakukan's Weekly Shonen Sunday in September 1978. At {{the start of the}} series it was only scheduled to run for 5 chapters. Ataru was the central character and each chapter would feature a different strange character. The character of Lum was <b>only</b> <b>going</b> to appear for the first chapter and was not in the second chapter, however Takahashi decided to re-include her in the third chapter. The series was not an instant success and chapters were initially published sporadically. Between May and September 1978 she simultaneously worked on a series called Dust Spot, however the increasing popularity of Urusei Yatsura caused her to focus on Urusei and the series became a regular serialization from the middle of 1979.|$|E
25|$|The 1983–84 season saw Tennessee {{start out}} 6–4. However, Summitt rallied her team and {{finished}} 22–10, for her eighth straight 20-win season, a streak that still continues.

However, Tennessee lost by 11 to USC, which also had won the title the previous year. Pat Summitt earned Coach of the Year honors. This season was followed up by another 20-win year in which Tennessee earned both the regular season SEC title (despite <b>only</b> <b>going</b> 4–4) and the tournament title. However, the Lady Vols fell in the NCAA Tournament to Ole Miss during the round of 16.|$|E

25|$|It {{took many}} years to build a {{complete}} line to serve the Northland Region, with different sections being developed at different times. Eventually {{it became clear that}} a main line was required to link these isolated railways to improve transport for both passengers and freight to and from New Zealand's northernmost region, and to open up land for greater economic development. However, the construction was not without criticism. In 1910, the Minister of Railways himself criticised the project, arguing that the project of extending it would bring little benefit, as most traffic from north of Auckland was already covered by <b>only</b> <b>going</b> as far as Helensville, while country to the north was poor and {{would not be able to}} support the line.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} a new racino at Aqueduct Racetrack led to a {{proposal}} from Governor Andrew Cuomo to build a massive convention center in the vicinity. Talks of reactivating the line were publicly endorsed in February 2012 by Assemblymen Phillip Goldfeder and Michael G. Miller. Goldfeder commented “The commute for people here is <b>only</b> <b>going</b> to go from bad to worse. You can’t talk about a convention center without talking about transportation.” Goldfeder and Miller said they are not opposed to turning sections of the line into a park named Queensway, but said {{people who live in}} Rockaway, Ozone Park, Howard Beach, and other areas along the right-of-way have no quick or easy way to get into Manhattan. The Genting Group, which operates the racino and has been asked to construct the convention center, was evaluating several plans to increase transportation access, and was committed to paying for part of the transportation improvements. Queensway advocates are against resumption of rail service, stating that current bus service fills current transportation needs in the area.|$|E
25|$|In November 1975 he {{flew out}} to Saudi Arabia {{for a trial}} at top-flight Al-Hilal, as manager George Smith, {{the man who had}} signed him at Stalybridge, offered him the chance to earn a tax-free {{contract}} in the oil-rich nation. He impressed on the trial and was offered a contract, this made him the first European to play professionally in Saudi Arabia. Club president Prince Abdullah bin Nasser bin Abdulaziz Al Saud bought O'Keefe a Pontiac Ventura, before taking the young player on a luxurious tour of Europe, visiting five star hotels in London, Paris, Cannes, and Rome, before returning to Riyadh {{for the start of the}} new Saudi season of football. However, on the trip he asked an O'Keefe to give up his football career to become his lover, and was refused. As Prince Abdullah was such as a wealthy and powerful man in Saudi Arabia (a member of the House of Saud), O'Keefe fled the country, fearing for his safety. As he needed Prince Abdullah's permission to leave the country, O'Keefe had to convince him that he was <b>only</b> <b>going</b> to stay in England for one week so as to visit his ill father (who was in fact in good health). Upon his return he informed The Football Association, who gave him advice after forming an emergency meeting.|$|E
