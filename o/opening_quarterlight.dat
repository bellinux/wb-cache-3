2500|$|The Mark III Mini was {{launched}} in 1969, which was {{an updated version of}} Mark II with a modified bodyshell. The most visible changes were larger doors with concealed hinges. The boot lid lost the original hinged number plate and its recess shape and a large rear colour-coded lamp was fitted in its place, along with larger rear side windows. Sliding windows were replaced with winding windows—although some Australian-manufactured Mark I Minis had adopted this feature in 1965 (with <b>opening</b> <b>quarterlight</b> windows). The suspension reverted from Hydrolastic to rubber cones. as a cost-saving measure. Production at the Cowley plant was ended, and the simple name [...] "Mini" [...] completely replaced the separate Austin and Morris brands.|$|E
5000|$|The Mark III Mini had a {{modified}} bodyshell with enough alterations {{to see the}} factory code change from ADO15 to ADO20 (which it shared with the Clubman). The most obvious changes were larger doors with concealed hinges. Customer demand led to the sliding windows being replaced with winding windows—although some Australian-manufactured Mark I Minis had adopted this feature in 1965 (with <b>opening</b> <b>quarterlight</b> windows). The suspension reverted from Hydrolastic to rubber cones as a cost-saving measure. [...] (The 1275 GT and Clubman would retain the hydrolastic system until June 1971 when they, too, switched to the rubber cone suspension of the original Minis.) ...|$|E

5000|$|The final pre-war {{model was}} the 1938 Minx. There {{were no more}} factory-built tourers but some were made by Carbodies. The car was {{visually}} similar to the Magnificent, with a different grille, {{and access to the}} luggage boot (trunk) was external (that on the predecessor was accessed by folding down the rear seat). There were two saloon models in the range, the basic [...] "Safety" [...] model with simple rexine trim instead of leather, no <b>opening</b> front <b>quarterlights,</b> and less luxurious trim levels. The De Luxe model had leather trim, <b>opening</b> <b>quarterlights,</b> extra trim pads, and various other comfort benefits. The 1938 model was not the final iteration before the outbreak of war, however, as the 1939 model was considerably different mechanically, with virtually the entire drivetrain improved to the extent that few parts are interchangeable with the 1938 model. This includes gearbox, differential, half shafts, steering box, and a great many other mechanical and cosmetic changes. Even the front grille, which to the casual eye looks almost identical to the 1938 model, became a pressed alloy component rather than a composite.|$|R
50|$|New Zealand {{distributor}} Todd Motors {{had assembled}} the Valiant sedan from CKD kits since the AP5, mostly following the Australian range though with fewer variants and engine choices plus local upholstery. For the VH, {{it was a}} little more adventurous, launching a unique-to-NZ Ranger XL sedan as the base model with a two-barrel carburetor version of the 245ci Hemi-6 engine, no tail lamp trim surrounds or door window brightwork, unique seats and upholstery, and manual or automatic, column-shift transmission. The Regal 770 had the 265ci Hemi-6, floor-console automatic shifter, round dials with wood trim in place of the strip speedo and its own unique front bucket seats and trim. The 318ci V8 was optional and a vinyl roof was standard but could be deleted to order. Todd's sole locally-built Charger model was also to '770' trim with the 265ci Hemi-6 six and three-speed floor shift auto and did not have the bumper overriders standard in Australia. Early runs had one-piece front door glass and hinged opening rear side windows but, due to problems with water leaks and excessive wind noise, this was soon changed to <b>opening</b> front <b>quarterlights</b> and fixed rear side glass. Wagons were imported from Australia, to Australian specification.|$|R
