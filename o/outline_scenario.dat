40|$|Insects detect odorants {{primarily}} using odorant receptors (OR) {{housed in}} the dendritic membrane of olfactory sensory neurons (OSN). Pioneering studies indicated that insects, like mammals, detect odorants in a combinatorial fashion with a specific odor ligand activating several broadly tuned ORs, and each OR being activated by several ligands. Several recent studies, however, challenge this view by providing examples where ecologically relevant odorants are detected by high-specificity ORs activating dedicated neuronal circuits. Here we review these contrasting findings on the ligand selectivity of insect ORs and their neuronal wiring, and <b>outline</b> <b>scenarios</b> describing how adaptive and neutral evolution might shape both narrow and broad receptor tuning. The fact that not all ORs display narrow tuning might partly be due to key ligands having been missed from screens or too high stimuli concentrations being used. However, the birth-and-death model of OR evolution, involving both adaptive and neutral events, could also explain the evolution of broad tuning in certain receptors due to positive selection or relaxed constraint. If the insect olfactory system indeed contains both narrowly and broadly tuned ORs, this {{suggests that it is}} a hybrid between dedicated channels and combinatorial coding. The relative extent of the two coding modes is then likely to differ between species, depending on requirements of perceived chemical space {{and the size of the}} OR repertoire. We address this by <b>outlining</b> <b>scenarios</b> where certain insect groups may be more likely to have evolved combinatorial coding as their dominant coding strategy. Combinatorial coding may have evolved predominantly in insects that benefit from the ability to discriminate between a larger number of odorants and odor objects, such as polyphagous or social species. Alternatively, combinatorial coding may have evolved simply as a mechanism to increase perceived odor space in species with small OR repertoires...|$|R

The experiments allowed us to identify sources of poor performance due to TCP and other TG protocol re-lated timers. Through these experiments we were able to choose appropriate timer values and achieve better results. We also measured performance for specific graph formulations, mainly different size k-ary graphs, under different conditions (such as speed and node den-sity). Our experiments led us to pose some question regarding the feasibility of instantiating a TG for a specific <b>outlined</b> <b>scenario.</b> Lack of resources or connectivity can be predicted by parsing scenario files prior to the actual simulation experiment. We were able to measure a probability of successful instantiation under different scenarios thus bringing us closer to the task of TG admission control...|$|R

DOI: 10. 1109 /ROMAN. 2008. 4600663 This paper describes the user-centred development of play scenarios for robot assisted play, as part of the IROMEC project that develops a novel robotic toy for children with special needs. The project investigates how robotic toys can become social mediators, encouraging children with special needs to discover a range of play styles, from solitary to collaborative play (with peers, carers/teachers, parents etc). This paper presents the developmental process of constructing relevant play scenarios for children with different special needs. This process is driven by a) a comprehensive literature review that is related to play activities of children from different target user groups with existing technology, consultation with panel of experts (therapist, teachers, parents) and b) by the result of experimental investigations of user requirements in trials with children with special needs. An important step (reported here) towards the development of the final play scenarios is the development of <b>Outline</b> Play <b>Scenarios</b> ??? a set of abstract scenarios that reflect the users' requirements and which are not related to any specific technological solution. The general methodological approach, as well as the <b>outline</b> play <b>scenarios,</b> may benefit the development of scenarios for other human-robot interaction research in robot assisted play and related areas.
