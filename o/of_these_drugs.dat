5|$|For ischaemic heart disease, {{treatment}} {{also includes}} amelioration of symptoms. This includes nitroglycerin, beta blockers and, {{in the context}} of an acute event, stronger pain relief such as morphine and other opiates. Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>drugs</b> have additional protective benefits, by decreasing the sympathetic tone on the heart that occurs with the pain, or by dilating blood vessels (GTN).|$|E

5|$|Although {{many of the}} afore-mentioned inhibitors {{share the}} same Hsp90 binding site (either N- or C-terminal), {{it has been shown}} that some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>drugs</b> {{preferentially}} access distinct Hsp90 populations, which are differentiated by the extent of their post-translational modification. Though no published inhibitor has yet to distinguish between Hsp90A and Hsp90B, a recent study has shown that phosphorylation of a particular residue in the Hsp90 N-terminus can provide isoform specificity to inhibitor binding., thus providing an additional level of regulation for optimal Hsp90 targeting.|$|E
5|$|HIV {{infections are}} usually {{treated with a}} {{combination}} of antiviral drugs, each targeting a different stage in the virus's life-cycle. There are drugs that prevent the virus from attaching to cells, others that are nucleoside analogues and some poison the virus's enzymes that it needs to reproduce. The success <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>drugs</b> is proof of the importance of knowing how viruses reproduce.|$|E
5|$|Only 5–10% of {{levodopa}} {{crosses the}} blood–brain barrier. Much {{of the remainder}} is metabolized to dopamine elsewhere in the body, causing a variety of side effects including nausea, vomiting and orthostatic hypotension. Carbidopa and benserazide are dopa decarboxylase inhibitors which do not cross the blood-brain barrier and inhibit the conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain, reducing side effects and improving the availability of levodopa for passage into the brain. One <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>drugs</b> is usually taken along with levodopa, often combined with levodopa in the same pill.|$|E
40|$|Escherichia coli 15 T− can {{initiate}} {{a cycle of}} deoxyribonucleic acid replication with equal efficiency {{in the presence of}} 25 or 50 μg <b>of</b> chloramphenicol/ml.

She was repeatedly tested during competition, and she passed all <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>drug</b> tests. Griffith Joyner made public her decision to retire from Olympic competition one week after {{it was announced that}} random out-of-competition drug testing would be instituted during the 1989 season.|$|R
5000|$|PNIPA {{have also}} been used in pH-sensitive drug {{delivery}} systems. Some examples <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>drug</b> delivery systems may include the intestinal delivery of human calcitonin, delivery of insulin, and the delivery of ibuprofen. [...] When radiolabeled PNIPA copolymers with different molecular weights were intravenously injected to rats, {{it was found that}} the glomerular filtration threshold of the polymer was around 32 000 g/mol.|$|R
5|$|There are {{a number}} of drugs that can help prevent or {{interrupt}} malaria in travelers to places where infection is common. Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>drugs</b> are also used in treatment. Chloroquine may be used where chloroquine-resistant parasites are not common. In places where Plasmodium is resistant to one or more medications, three medications—mefloquine (Lariam), doxycycline (available generically), or the combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride (Malarone)—are frequently used when prophylaxis is needed. Doxycycline and the atovaquone plus proguanil combination are the best tolerated; mefloquine is associated with death, suicide, and neurological and psychiatric symptoms.|$|E
5|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} {{was used}} for the identification of antibiotic drugs such as: eight β-lactam (ampicillin sodium, penicillin G procaine, cefalexin, ampicillin trihydrate, benzathine penicillin, benzylpenicillin sodium, cefotaxime sodium, Ceftriaxone sodium), three tetracycline (doxycycline hydrochloride, oxytetracycline dehydrate, tetracycline hydrochloride) and two macrolide (azithromycin, erythromycin estolate) antibiotic drugs. Each <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>drugs</b> has a unique XRD pattern that makes their identification possible.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{recommendation}} of the EACD, the New Zealand government has passed legislation which placed BZP, along with the other piperazine derivatives TFMPP, mCPP, pFPP, MeOPP and MBZP, into Class C of the New Zealand Misuse of Drugs Act 1975. A ban was intended to come into effect in New Zealand on 18 December 2007, but the law change did not go through until the following year, and the sale of BZP and the other listed piperazines became illegal in New Zealand as of 1 April 2008. An amnesty for possession and usage <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>drugs</b> was in effect until October 2008, at which point they became completely illegal.|$|E
40|$|Combination of Tolenorm oil and Tolenorm {{ointment}} {{was tested}} on co-culture of melanocytes and keratinocytes in vitro to understand whether the effect <b>of</b> <b>these</b> Siddha <b>drugs</b> {{results in the}} transfer of melanin from melanocytes to keratinocytes. The findings {{of the present study}} authenticates the established likely mechanism <b>of</b> action <b>of</b> <b>these</b> Siddha <b>drugs</b> with reference to up-regulation of tyrosinase activity, melanogenesis, dendrite formation and increase in dendrite length directly impact the pigment transfer...|$|R
50|$|Antifibrinolytics, such as {{aminocaproic acid}} (ε-aminocaproic acid) and {{tranexamic}} acid {{are used as}} inhibitors <b>of</b> fibrinolysis. <b>These</b> lysine-like <b>drugs</b> interfere {{with the formation of}} the fibrinolytic enzyme plasmin from its precursor plasminogen by plasminogen activators (primarily t-PA and u-PA) which takes place mainly in lysine rich areas on the surface <b>of</b> fibrin. <b>These</b> <b>drugs</b> block the binding sites of the enzymes or plasminogen respectively and thus stop plasmin formation.|$|R
50|$|ADHD is {{the most}} {{successfully}} treated disorder of child psychopathology, and the medications used have a high- abuse rate especially among college-aged students. Psycho stimulants such as Ritalin, amphetamine- related stimulant drugs: e.g., Adderall, and antidepressants such as Wellbutrin have been successfully used to treat ADHD with a 78% success rate. Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>drug</b> treatment options are paired with behavioral treatment such as therapy or social skills lessons.|$|R
5|$|Reduction in the {{activity}} of the cholinergic neurons is a well-known feature of Alzheimer's disease. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are employed to reduce the rate at which acetylcholine (ACh) is broken down, thereby increasing the concentration of ACh in the brain and combating the loss of ACh caused by the death of cholinergic neurons. There is evidence for the efficacy of these medications in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, and some evidence for their use in the advanced stage. Only donepezil is approved for treatment of advanced AD dementia. The use <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>drugs</b> in mild cognitive impairment has not shown any effect in a delay of the onset of AD. The most common side effects are nausea and vomiting, both of which are linked to cholinergic excess. These side effects arise in approximately 10–20% of users, are mild to moderate in severity, and can be managed by slowly adjusting medication doses. Less common secondary effects include muscle cramps, decreased heart rate (bradycardia), decreased appetite and weight, and increased gastric acid production.|$|E
25|$|Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>drugs</b> are {{associated}} with physical and psychological dependence. Sleep problems may occur.|$|E

Recommendations, concerning conditions of cryopreservation <b>of</b> seeds <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>drug</b> plant species were developed, basing on the obtained results...|$|R
40|$|Currently {{therapy for}} ischaemic {{heart disease is}} based on drugs such as beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, Ca 2 + antagonists and nitrates, which have {{pronounced}} haemodynamic effects. However, <b>these</b> <b>drugs</b> can have adverse reactions including systemic haemodynamic effects, leading to low blood pressure and peripheral oedema in some patients. Recent observations that certain types of Ca 2 + antagonist prevent the Ca 2 + overload that occurs after ischaemia {{have led to the}} design of new anti-ischaemic drugs that are cytoprotective, but have no (or few) haemodynamic effects. In this article, Pieter van Zwieten and colleagues assess the therapeutic potential <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>drug...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{most useful}} drugs (INH and RMP) {{should be tested}} first, because the absence <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>drugs</b> from a {{treatment}} regimen severely impairs its efficacy.|$|E
25|$|Biopharmaceuticals such as {{monoclonal}} antibodies differ biologically {{from small}} molecule drugs. Generic versions <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>drugs,</b> known as biosimilars, are typically regulated under an extended set of rules.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine {{can also}} {{interact}} {{with a number}} of psychoactive medications, including tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, causing increased blood levels <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>drugs</b> and the potential of subsequent toxicity.|$|E
50|$|Loperamide is an anti-diarrheal agent which {{decreases}} intestinal movement. As such, {{when combined}} with other antimotility drugs, there is an increased risk <b>of</b> constipation. <b>These</b> <b>drugs</b> include other opioids, antihistamines, antipsychotics, and anticholinergics.|$|R
50|$|A general {{anaesthetic}} (or anesthetic) is a {{drug that}} brings about a reversible loss <b>of</b> consciousness. <b>These</b> <b>drugs</b> are generally administered by an anaesthetist/anesthesiologist in order to induce or maintain general anaesthesia to facilitate surgery.|$|R
50|$|Many {{forms of}} blood doping {{stem from the}} misuse <b>of</b> pharmaceuticals. <b>These</b> <b>drug</b> {{treatments}} have been created for clinical use to increase the oxygen delivery when {{the human body is}} not able to do so naturally.|$|R
25|$|Tolerance {{to these}} adverse effects <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>drugs</b> often {{develops}} if treatment is continued. Side effects {{may also be}} less troublesome if treatment is initiated with low doses and then gradually increased, although this may also delay the beneficial effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{first-line}} {{treatment for}} many psychotic disorders is antipsychotic medication. Meta-analyses <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>drugs</b> show either {{no difference in}} effects, or a moderate effect size, suggesting that the mechanism of psychosis {{is more complex than}} an overactive dopamine system.|$|E
