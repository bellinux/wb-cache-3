The distribution and survival of plant species, especially those that inhabit alpine environments, as well as animals that are specifically adapted to those environments, will also be adversely affected. Glaciers are also expected to recede due to a decreased buildup of snowpack and higher overall temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Bengal was {{the site}} of several major janapadas. In the 2ndcentury BCE, the region was conquered by the emperor Ashoka. In the 4thcentury CE, it was absorbed into the Gupta Empire. From the 13thcentury onward, the region was ruled by several sultans, {{powerful}} Hindu states, and Baro-Bhuyan landlords, until the beginning of British rule in the 18thcentury. The British East India Company cemented their hold <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> following the Battle of Plassey in 1757, and Calcutta served for many years as the capital of British India. The early and prolonged exposure to British administration resulted in an expansion of Western education, culminating in developments in science, institutional education, and social reforms in the region, including {{what became known as the}} Bengal Renaissance. A hotbed of the Indian independence movement through the early 20thcentury, Bengal was divided during India's independence in 1947 along religious lines into two separate entities: West Bengala state of Indiaand East Bengalthe part of the newly created nation of Pakistan that later became Bangladesh. Between 1977 and 2011 the state was administered by the world's longest elected Communist government.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in July 1940, the Red Army General Staff {{developed}} war {{plans that}} identified the Wehrmacht {{as the most}} dangerous threat to the Soviet Union, {{and that in the}} case of a war with Germany, the Wehrmacht's main attack would come through the region north of the Pripyat Marshes into Belorussia, which later proved to be correct. Stalin disagreed, and in October he authorized the development of new plans that assumed a German attack would focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> south of Pripyat Marshes towards the economically vital regions in Ukraine. This became the basis for all subsequent Soviet war plans and the deployment of their armed forces in preparation for the German invasion.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his failure}} to take Ayutthaya, Tabinshwehti claimed to have regained control of the Tavoy frontier. Indeed, the Burmese chronicles claim the Siamese king had agreed to pay an annual tribute. Even if this claim was true, the Toungoo Dynasty's control over Tavoy lasted {{a little over a}} year in any case. Tabinshwehti was assassinated just a year after the Siamese {{campaign}} on 30 April 1550, and the empire he had built in the previous 16 years quickly collapsed, with each town claiming a king. Even after Bayinnaung had restored the kingdom in the following years, the frontier region was likely under overlapping spheres of influence. (During his 1554–1555 campaign against Upper Burma, his southernmost garrison was at Ye, not Tavoy.) It was only in 1562 that Bayinnaung made an emphatic claim <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> by setting up a Burmese garrison at Tavoy, in preparation for his invasion of Siam a year later.|$|E
5|$|Gray was {{not chosen}} for camouflage, however, it did, at times, provide {{enough of a}} mask along tree lines during battle; keeping the line of Infantry hidden long enough to strike effectively. At {{the time of the}} American Civil War, the {{usefulness}} of camouflage was not generally recognized. Gray was chosen for Confederate uniforms because gray dye could be made relatively cheaply and it was the standard uniform color of the various State Militias. The gray uniforms worn by early State volunteers was normally a shade of cadet gray, which is not suitable for combat wear, as it gives away the position of the individual easily from its bright blue-gray tones, and for this reason it was preserved by some men for dress-parade functions. The gray mentioned is dull toned, often varying in color depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> and time during the conflict, resulting in a uniform that could blend in with the tree lines, or hide the men in the field wearing them.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the war, Parliament ordered the slighting of castles across the country, deliberately destroying or damaging the structures to prevent them being used in any subsequent Royalist uprisings. North Wales proved to be a special case, as there were concerns that Charles II might lead a Presbyterian uprising in Scotland and mount a sea-borne attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>region.</b> Conwy, Caernarfon and Beaumaris were initially garrisoned by Parliament to defend against such an attack. Conwy was later partially slighted in 1655, but Caernarfon and Beaumaris escaped entirely. Harlech, less of a potential Scottish target, was rendered unusable by Parliament, but was not totally demolished.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} {{period of the}} Ukrainian SSR, Odessa Governorate was formed out of parts of the former Kherson Governorate. This new area {{formed the basis for}} modern Odessa Oblast.

About a decade later, the Nazi occupation of Ukraine during the Second World War had a devastating impact on the region's previously large Jewish population.

5|$|Neptune's orbit has a {{profound}} impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> directly beyond it, known as the Kuiper belt. The Kuiper belt is a ring of small icy worlds, similar to the asteroid belt but far larger, extending from Neptune's orbit at 30AU out to about 55AU from the Sun. Much {{in the same way}} that Jupiter's gravity dominates the asteroid belt, shaping its structure, so Neptune's gravity dominates the Kuiper belt. Over the age of the Solar System, certain regions of the Kuiper belt became destabilised by Neptune's gravity, creating gaps in the Kuiper belt's structure. The region between 40 and 42AU is an example.|$|E
