5|$|Also {{attributable}} to Gasparo Cairano, and dated at this stage, is the singular St John the Baptist {{placed in the}} tympanum of the capitol of the eponymous Abbey in Parma. The work, undocumented and traditionally attributed by critics to Antonio Ferrari d'Agrate, was assigned in 2010 to the catalog <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Cairano due to obvious correlation with the mature art of the artist. This spread of Gasparo's artistic reach is significant and demonstrates that he could prove a success even outside of Brescia.|$|E

She married Ravetch in 1946 but worked independently for ten years, finally collaborating with him in 1957, a relationship that continued {{for the remainder of}} her career. During 33 years of collaboration, they created the screenplays for a variety of films, mainly adaptations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> American authors.|$|E
5|$|Garran {{was also}} {{involved}} with the arts; he was the vice-president of the Canberra Musical Society, where he sang and played the clarinet, and in 1946 won a national song competition run by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

50|$|From 1906, the {{writings}} and theories of Mackay {{had a significant}} influence on Adolf Brand's organisation Gemeinschaft der Eigenen. Mackay was also a key populariser <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Max Stirner (1806-1856) outside Germany, writing a biography <b>of</b> <b>the</b> philosopher which also added greatly to <b>the</b> understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Friedrich Nietzsche in <b>the</b> English-speaking world.|$|R

5|$|Her {{essays on}} Pushkin and Poem Without a Hero, her longest work, were only {{published}} after her death. This long poem, composed between 1940 and 1965, is often critically regarded as her best work and {{also one of}} the finest poems of the twentieth century. It gives a deep and detailed analysis of her epoch and her approach to it, including her important encounter with Isaiah Berlin (1909–97) in 1945. Her talent in composition and translation is evidenced in her fine translations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> poets writing in French, English, Italian, Armenian, and Korean.|$|E

5|$|The first {{complete}} {{collection of}} the Drapier's Letters appeared in the 1734 George Faulkner edition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Works</b> <b>of</b> Jonathan Swift along with an allegorical frontispiece offering praise and thanks from the Irish people.

5|$|The {{theme of}} the work is Jesus as the conqueror <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> the devil, who is {{frequently}} mentioned as the serpent. The music is festively scored, using two horns, similar to Part IV of Bach's later Christmas Oratorio. The text by an unknown poet is organised in eight movements, beginning with a choral movement on the biblical text, followed by a sequence of recitatives and arias which is structured as three stanzas from three different hymns. Only two of these hymns are Christmas carols.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two stories}} about how {{the name of this}} altar came about.

The second relates to painter Simon Pereyns, who despite being the author of many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> the cathedral, was accused of blasphemy. According to the story, while Pereyns was in jail, he painted such a beautiful image of the Virgin Mary that his crime was forgiven.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of his}} {{endeavour}} {{to expose}} the public to more foreign-language works, Johnson facilitated the translation of educational texts, serious fiction, and philosophy (he was less interested in translating popular novels). In particular, he promoted the translation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> persecuted French Girondins, such as Condorcet's Outlines of an Historical View of the Progress of the Human Mind (1795) and Madame Roland's An Appeal to Impartial Posterity (1795), which he had released in English within weeks of its debut in France. His publication of a translation of Constanin Volney's deistic Les Ruines, ou méditations sur les révolutions des empires (1791) quickly became a bestseller. Johnson also {{had some of the}} most prominent French children's literature translated, such as the works of Madame de Genlis.|$|E
5|$|Boletus edulis {{was first}} {{described}} in 1782 by the French botanist Pierre Bulliard and still bears its original name. The starting date of fungal taxonomy {{had been set}} as January1, 1821, {{to coincide with the}} date <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> the 'father of mycology', Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries, which meant the name required sanction by Fries (indicated in the name by a colon) to be considered valid, as Bulliard's work preceded this date. It was thus written Boletus edulis Bull.:Fr. A 1987 revision of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature set the starting date at May1, 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus' work, the Species Plantarum. Hence, the name no longer requires the ratification of Fries' authority. Early alternate names include Boletus solidus by English naturalist James Sowerby in 1809, and Gray's Leccinum edule. Gray's transfer of the species to Leccinum was later determined to be inconsistent with the rules of botanical nomenclature, and he apparently was unfamiliar with the earlier works of Fries when he published his arrangement of bolete species.|$|E
5|$|During the 1740s, Smart {{published}} many poems while {{a student}} at Pembroke College, Cambridge. He eventually left the university in 1749 to devote his time to poetry. In 1750, Smart started to familiarise himself with Grub Street, London's writing district, and met John Newbery, a publisher. Soon after, Newbery began publishing Smart's works in various magazines and in collections, including Poems on Several Occasions (1752). Of these works, Smart {{was known for his}} Seatonian Prize-winning poems, his pastoral poem The Hop-Garden, and his mock epic The Hilliad. In 1752, Smart married Newbery's daughter, Anna Maria Carnan, and had two daughters with her by 1754. Although many of Smart's works were published between 1753 and 1755, he had little money to provide for his family. At the end of 1755, he finished a translation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Horace, but even that provided little income. Having no other choices, Smart signed a 99-year-long contract in November 1755 to produce a weekly paper entitled The Universal Visiter or Monthly Memorialist, and the strain of writing caused Smart's health to deteriorate.|$|E
