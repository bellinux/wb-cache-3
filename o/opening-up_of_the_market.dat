This policy brief outlines the market for financial market data, the provisions of MiFID and the implementing measures regarding financial data and data consolidation. It also looks at the approaches taken by CESR, the FSA and the US authorities. It concludes that markets should be capable of adapting and that additional licensing requirements, such as those proposed by the FSA, are in fact premature and act as a barrier to the single market.

40|$|The US–Japan {{trade dispute}} {{has been widely}} reported. It {{continues}} to threaten <b>the</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world trading order because the United States alleges that <b>the</b> Japanese <b>market</b> remains ‘closed’ to its exports. The Clinton administration {{has made it clear}} that it will judge <b>the</b> openness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese <b>market</b> by results. In light of this, this paper examines how <b>the</b> pattern <b>of</b> Japan’s total multilateral trade and trade with the United States has changed between 1981 and 1991.

40|$|After {{practically}} all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> southern-rim countries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean gained their independence, <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> national construction has been predicated on authoritarian regimes. These regimes justified both <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> force against political opposition {{and the limits}} on rights and liberties {{on the need for}} maintaining <b>the</b> unanimity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people which had manifested itself during the struggles for liberation from the colonial yoke. Towards <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1980 s, the regional and international context seemed to presage a very much longed for <b>opening-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> political scene after some of these countries (Tunisia, Algeria and Jordan) initiated a series of movements that pointed to their democratisation. <b>The</b> posterior evolution <b>of</b> events has crushed those hopes in every case, and only Morocco and Jordan (each with their respective limitations) appear to have evolved towards a softening <b>of</b> repression. <b>The</b> excuse put forth from <b>the</b> collection <b>of</b> states in <b>the</b> region to justify the step backwards is <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> two threats they must act with forcefulness before: <b>the</b> threat <b>of</b> Islamic “fundamentalism” and <b>the</b> desire <b>of</b> certain groups to boycott the on-going Israeli-Palestinian Peace Process...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{diverging}} {{policy choices}} {{in the developed world}} and emerging market countries have been accompanied by a return of private cross-border capital inflows to a number <b>of</b> countries. <b>The</b> increasingly integrated global financial market has spurred capitals to fl ow more easily across borders in search for higher returns. Emerging market countries and commodity exporters have been <b>the</b> desirable destination <b>of</b> such flows. Major pull factors are noted, including improvement in the macroeconomics stability and management that have led to better growth prospects in EMEs and <b>the</b> <b>opening-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capital account in varying degrees. These surges have also been driven by a number of push factors such as near zero policy rates in the major centers and perceived low returns in advanced economies. However, recipient countries have also noted <b>the</b> increased volatility <b>of</b> such capital inflows. While domestic policy mix is crucial, the potentially unprecedented repercussion of volatile capital flows requires multidimensional measures including ones originated from regional and global initiatives. The IMF is well-placed to play increasing roles in conducting surveillance, providing global liquidity through its financing facilities, and not less important, giving appropriate policy advices adopting more customised and open-minded perspectives. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>opening-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{magnetic}} field during solar eruptive events is {{often accompanied by}} a dimming <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local coronal emission. From observations of filament eruptions recorded with the Extreme-Ultraviolet Imager on STEREO during 2008 - 2009, {{it is evident that}} these dimmings are much more pronounced in 19. 5 nm than in the lower-temperature line 17. 1 nm, as viewed either on the disk or above the limb. We conclude that most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cooler coronal plasma is not ejected but remains gravitationally bound when the loops open up. This result is consistent with Doppler measurements by Imada and coworkers, who found that the upflow speeds in a transient coronal hole increased dramatically above a temperature of 1 MK; it is also consistent with <b>the</b> quasistatic behavior <b>of</b> polar plumes, as compared with the hotter interplume regions that are <b>the</b> main source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fast solar wind. When the open flux reconnects and closes down again, the trapped plasma is initially heated to such high temperatures that it is no longer visible at Fe IX 17. 1 nm. Correspondingly, 17. 1 nm images show a dark ribbon or ``heat wave'' propagating away from the polarity inversion line and coinciding with the brightened Fe XV 28. 4 nm and Fe XII 19. 5 nm post-eruptive loops and their footpoint areas. Such dark ribbons provide a clear example of dimmings that are not caused by a density depletion. <b>The</b> propagation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ``heat wave'' is driven by the closing-down, not <b>the</b> <b>opening-up,</b> <b>of</b> flux and can be observed both off-limb and on-disk.
