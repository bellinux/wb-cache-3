5|$|Five {{medications}} {{have evidence}} for long-term use <b>orlistat,</b> lorcaserin, liraglutide, phentermine–topiramate, and naltrexone–bupropion. They result in weight loss {{after one year}} ranged from 3.0 to 6.7kg over placebo. <b>Orlistat,</b> liraglutide, and naltrexone–bupropion are available in both the United States and Europe, whereas lorcaserin and phentermine–topiramate are available only in the United States. European regulatory authorities rejected the latter two drugs {{in part because of}} associations of heart valve problems with lorcaserin and more general heart and blood vessel problems with phentermine–topiramate. <b>Orlistat</b> use is associated with high rates of gastrointestinal side effects and concerns have been raised about negative effects on the kidneys. There is no information on how these drugs affect longer-term complications of obesity such as cardiovascular disease or death.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion, {{when used}} for {{treating}} obesity {{over a period}} of 6 to 12 months, may result in weight loss of 2.7kg over placebo. This is not much different from the weight loss produced by several other medications, such as sibutramine or <b>orlistat.</b> It has been studied in combination with naltrexone. Concerns from bupropion include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. In September 2014, a combination (bupropion/naltrexone) was approved by the US FDA for the treatment of obesity.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{a higher}} {{incidence}} of breast cancer amongst those taking <b>orlistat</b> in early, pooled clinical trial data—the analysis of which delayed FDA review of orlistat—a two-year study published in 1999 found similar rates between <b>orlistat</b> and placebo (0.54% versus 0.51%), and evidence that tumors predated treatment in 3 of the 4 participants who had them. There is evidence from an in vitro study to suggest that the introduction of specific varied preparations containing <b>orlistat,</b> namely the concurrent administration of <b>orlistat</b> and the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, can induce cell death in breast cancer cells and block their growth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Orlistat</b> has {{historically}} been available by prescription only, and this situation continues in Canada. In Australia, the European Union, and the United States, certain formulations of <b>orlistat</b> have been approved for sale without a prescription.|$|E
25|$|<b>Orlistat</b> is the {{saturated}} {{derivative of}} lipstatin, a potent natural inhibitor of pancreatic lipases {{isolated from the}} bacterium Streptomyces toxytricini. However, due to its relative simplicity and stability, <b>orlistat</b> was chosen over lipstatin for development as an anti-obesity drug.|$|E
25|$|<b>Orlistat</b> is {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of obesity. The amount of weight loss achieved with <b>orlistat</b> varies. In one-year clinical trials, between 35.5% and 54.8% of subjects achieved a 5% or greater decrease in body mass, although not all of this mass was necessarily fat. Between 16.4% and 24.8% achieved at least a 10% decrease in body fat. After <b>orlistat</b> was stopped, a significant number of subjects regained weight—up to 35% of the weight they had lost.|$|E
25|$|The {{incidence}} of {{type 2 diabetes}} in an obese population over four years is decreased with <b>orlistat</b> (6.2%) compared to placebo (9.0%). Long-term use of <b>orlistat</b> also leads to a very modest reduction in blood pressure (mean reductions of 2.5 and 1.9 mmHg in systolic and diastolic blood pressure respectively).|$|E
25|$|Consumer {{advocacy}} organization Public Citizen opposed over-the-counter approval for <b>orlistat.</b>|$|E
25|$|Benefits aside, however, <b>orlistat</b> is {{notorious for}} its {{gastrointestinal}} side effects (sometimes {{referred to as}} treatment effects), which can include steatorrhea (oily, loose stools). They decrease with time, however, and are the most frequently reported adverse effects of the drug. In Australia, the United States and the European Union, <b>orlistat</b> is available for sale without a prescription. Over-the-counter approval was controversial in the United States, with consumer advocacy group Public Citizen repeatedly opposing it on safety and efficacy grounds. Generic formulations of <b>orlistat</b> are available in some countries. In Australia it is listed as an S3 medication and so is available over the counter in pharmacies.|$|E
25|$|On 21 January 2009, the European Medicines Agency granted {{approval}} {{for the sale of}} <b>orlistat</b> without a prescription.|$|E
25|$|<b>Orlistat</b> {{works by}} {{inhibiting}} gastric and pancreatic lipases, the enzymes that break down triglycerides in the intestine. When lipase activity is blocked, triglycerides from the diet are not hydrolyzed into absorbable free fatty acids, and instead are excreted unchanged. Only trace amounts of <b>orlistat</b> are absorbed systemically; the primary effect is local lipase inhibition within the GI tract after an oral dose. The primary route of elimination {{is through the}} feces.|$|E
25|$|Alli became {{available}} in the U.S. in June 2007. It is sold as 60mg capsules—half the dosage of prescription <b>orlistat.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rapid {{weight loss}} {{increases}} risk of gallstones. Patients taking <b>orlistat,</b> a weight loss drug, {{may already be}} {{at increased risk for}} the formation of gall stones. Weight loss with <b>orlistat</b> can increase the risk of gall stones. On the contrary, ursodeoxycholic acid (UCDA), a bile acid, also a drug marketed as Ursodiol, appears to prevent formation of gallstones during weight loss. A high fat diet during weight loss also appears to prevent gallstones.|$|E
25|$|At times, such as {{in spring}} 2012, <b>orlistat</b> has come into short supply, with {{consequent}} price increases because of nonavailability {{of one of the}} drug's components.|$|E
25|$|Other {{classes of}} drugs in {{development}} include lipase inhibitors, similar to <b>orlistat.</b> Another lipase inhibitor, called GT 389-255, was being developed by Peptimmune (licensed from Genzyme). This was a novel combination of an inhibitor and a polymer designed to bind the undigested triglycerides therefore allowing increased fat expulsion without side effects such as oily stools that occur with <b>orlistat.</b> The development stalled as Phase 1 trials were conducted in 2004 {{and there was no}} further human clinical development afterward. In 2011, Peptimmune filed for Chapter 7 Liquidation.|$|E
25|$|At the {{standard}} prescription dose of 120mg three times daily before meals, <b>orlistat</b> prevents approximately 30% of dietary fat from being absorbed, and about 25% at {{the standard}} over-the-counter dose of 60mg. Higher doses {{do not produce}} more potent effects.|$|E
25|$|In January 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration {{issued an}} alert stating that some {{counterfeit}} versions of Alli sold over the Internet contain no <b>orlistat,</b> and instead contain the weight-loss drug sibutramine. The concentration of sibutramine in these counterfeit products {{is at least}} twice the amount recommended for weight loss.|$|E
25|$|The {{incidence}} of acute liver injury was {{higher in the}} periods both immediately before and immediately {{after the start of}} <b>orlistat</b> treatment. This suggests that the observed increased risks of liver injury linked to the start of treatment may reflect changes in health status associated with the decision to begin treatment rather than any causal effect of the drug.|$|E
25|$|An {{analysis}} of over 900 <b>orlistat</b> users in Ontario showed that their rate of acute kidney injury {{was more than}} triple that of non-users. The putative mechanism for this effect is postulated to be excessive oxalate absorption from the gut and its subsequent deposition in the kidney, with excessive oxalate absorption being a known consequence of fat malabsorption.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin A {{deficiencies}} generally {{occur as}} a result of fat-soluble vitamins deficiencies. This often comes after intestinal bypass procedures such as jejunoileal bypass (no longer performed) or biliopancreatic diversion/duodenal switch procedures. In these procedures, fat absorption is markedly impaired. There is also the possibility of a vitamin A deficiency with use of the weight-loss medication <b>orlistat</b> (marketed as Xenical and Alli).|$|E
25|$|There are no {{medications}} currently {{approved for}} the treatment of obesity in children. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends medications for obesity be discourage. <b>Orlistat</b> and sibutramine may be helpful in managing moderate obesity in adolescence. Metformin is minimally useful. A Cochrane review in 2016 concluded that medications might reduce BMI and bodyweight to a small extent in obese children and adolescents. This conclusion was based only on low quality evidence.|$|E
25|$|<b>Orlistat</b> {{is a drug}} {{designed}} to treat obesity. It is marketed as a prescription drug under the trade name Xenical by Roche in most countries, and is sold over-the-counter as Alli by GlaxoSmithKline in the United Kingdom and the United States. Its primary function is preventing the absorption of fats from the human diet by acting as a lipase inhibitor, thereby reducing caloric intake. It is intended for use {{in conjunction with a}} healthcare provider-supervised reduced-calorie diet.|$|E
25|$|According to Roche, {{side effects}} are most severe when {{beginning}} therapy and may decrease in frequency with time; this {{is supported by}} the results of the XENDOS study, which found that 36% of people had gastrointestinal adverse effects during their fourth year of taking <b>orlistat,</b> whereas 91% of study subjects had experienced at least one GI-related side effect {{during the first year of}} treatment. It has also been suggested that the decrease in side effects over time may be associated with long-term compliance with a low-fat diet.|$|E
2500|$|Generic <b>orlistat</b> is {{available}} in Iran under the brand Venustat manufactured by Aburaihan Pharmaceutical co., in India, under the brands Orlean (Eris), Vyfat, Olistat, Obelit, Orlica and Reeshape. [...] In Russia, <b>orlistat</b> {{is available}} under the brand names Xenical (Hoffmann–La Roche), Orsoten/Orsoten Slim (KRKA d. d.) and Xenalten (OBL-Pharm). In Austria, <b>orlistat</b> is available under the brand name Slimox. In Malaysia, <b>orlistat</b> is available under the brand name Cuvarlix and is marketed by Pharmaniaga.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Orlistat</b> {{was also}} {{recently}} found to inhibit the thioesterase domain of fatty acid synthase (FAS), an enzyme {{involved in the}} proliferation of cancer cells but not normal cells. However, potential side effects of <b>Orlistat,</b> such as inhibition of other cellular off-targets or poor bioavailability, might hamper its application as an effective antitumor agent. One profiling study undertook a chemical proteomics approach to look for new cellular targets of <b>orlistat,</b> including its off-targets [...] <b>Orlistat</b> also show potential activities mycobacteria and Trypanosoma brucei parasite (See further reading).|$|E
2500|$|The {{effectiveness}} of <b>orlistat</b> in promoting weight loss is definite but modest. Pooled data from clinical trials suggest that people given <b>orlistat</b> {{in addition to}} lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise, lose about [...] more than those not taking the drug {{over the course of}} a year. <b>Orlistat</b> also modestly reduces blood pressure and appears to prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes, whether from the weight loss itself or to other effects. In a large randomized controlled trial, <b>orlistat</b> was found to reduce the incidence of diabetes by nearly 40% in obese people.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Orlistat</b> {{may reduce}} plasma levels of {{ciclosporin}} (also known as [...] "cyclosporin" [...] or [...] "cyclosporine", trade names Sandimmune, Gengraf, Neoral, etc.), an immunosuppressive drug frequently {{used to prevent}} transplant rejection; the two drugs should therefore not be administered concomitantly. <b>Orlistat</b> can also impair absorption of the antiarrhythmic amiodarone. The MHRA has recently suggested that <b>Orlistat</b> could theoretically reduce the absorption of antiretroviral HIV medications.|$|E
2500|$|Absorption of fat-soluble {{vitamins}} and other fat-soluble nutrients is inhibited {{by the use}} of <b>orlistat.</b> A multivitamin tablet containing vitamins A, [...] D, E, K, and beta-carotene should be taken once a day, at bedtime, when using <b>orlistat.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In Australia and New Zealand, <b>orlistat</b> is [...] {{available}} over-the-counter in 120mg size (84 capsules to the pack). Initially {{available only}} with a prescription, it was reclassified as a [...] "Pharmacist Only Medicine" [...] in October 2003. In 2007 the Committee decided to keep <b>orlistat</b> as a Schedule 3 drug, but withdrew its authorization of direct-to-consumer Xenical advertising, stating this [...] "increased pressure on pharmacists to provide <b>orlistat</b> to consumers...this in turn {{had the potential to}} result in inappropriate patterns of use". Xenical has recently began being advertised direct-to-customers again.|$|E
2500|$|... certain drugs, like <b>orlistat,</b> which {{inhibits}} {{the absorption}} of fat.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Orlistat</b> (Xenical) reduces {{intestinal}} fat absorption by inhibiting pancreatic lipase. [...] Some side-effects {{of using}} <b>Orlistat</b> include frequent, oily bowel movements (steatorrhea). But if {{fat in the}} diet is reduced, symptoms often improve. [...] Originally available only by prescription, it {{was approved by the}} FDA for over-the-counter sale in February 2007. On 26 May 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a revised label for Xenical to include new safety information about cases of severe liver injury that have been reported rarely with the use of this medication. [...] Of the 40 million users of <b>Orlistat</b> worldwide, 13 cases of severe liver damage have been reported.|$|E
2500|$|Fecal fat {{excretion}} promotes colon carcinogenesis. [...] In 2006 {{the results}} of 30-day study were published indicating that <b>orlistat</b> at a dosage of 200mg/kg chow administered to rats consuming a high-fat chow and receiving two 25mg/kg doses of the potent carcinogen 1,2-dimethylhydrazine produced significantly higher numbers of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) colon lesions than did the carcinogen plus high-fat chow without <b>orlistat.</b> [...] ACF lesions {{are believed to be}} one of the earliest precursors of colon cancer.|$|E
2500|$|An April 2013 study {{published}} in the British Medical Journal [...] looked at 94,695 patients receiving <b>orlistat</b> in the UK between 1999 and 2011. This study showed no evidence of an increased risk of liver injury during treatment. They concluded: ...|$|E
2500|$|Interference {{with the}} body's ability to absorb {{specific}} nutrients in food. [...] For example, <b>Orlistat</b> (also known as Xenical and Alli) blocks fat breakdown and thereby prevents fat absorption. The OTC fiber supplements glucomannan and guar gum {{have been used}} for the purpose of inhibiting digestion and lowering caloric absorption ...|$|E
2500|$|Liquid stool is more {{difficult}} to control than formed, solid stool. Hence, FI can be exacerbated by diarrhea. Some consider diarrhea to be the most common aggravating factor. [...] <b>Orlistat</b> is an anti-obesity (weight loss) drug that blocks the absorption of fats. This may give side effects of FI, diarrhea and steatorrhea.|$|E
2500|$|Another drug, <b>orlistat,</b> blocks {{absorption}} of dietary fats, {{and as a}} result may cause oily spotting bowel movements (steatorrhea), oily stools, stomach pain, and flatulence. [...] A similar medication designed for patients with Type 2 diabetes is Acarbose; which partially blocks {{absorption of}} carbohydrates in the small intestine, and produces similar side effects including stomach pain and flatulence.|$|E
