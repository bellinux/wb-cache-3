40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{determine}} the impact of a operating conditions on the <b>deNOx</b> <b>system</b> efficiency. in a 966 MWth supercritical circulating fluidized bed boiler. Experimental tests were carried out on a full-scale <b>DeNOx</b> <b>system</b> installed in the world’s largest once through supercritical circulating fluidized bed boiler. In this work, the effects of the following parameters were studied: flue gas temperature inside the separators between 636 °C and 845 °C, relative ammonia mass flow over the range 0. 22 - 1. 00 and three relative values of O 2 concentration (i. e. 0. 94, 1. 0 and 1. 13). The efficiency of <b>deNOx</b> <b>system</b> increases (ca. 53 %) with increasing relative ammonia mass flow. A maximum <b>DeNOx</b> <b>system</b> efficiency (ca. 70 %) was achieved at flue gas temperature in the range from 720 °C to 790 °C. In the case of all unit loads, <b>deNOx</b> <b>system</b> efficiency from 36 % to 70 % was observed and performs a standard emissions relate to permissible concentration of NOx in the flue gas...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{will first}} provide {{background}} information on {{fluid catalytic cracking}} (FCC), a highly important unit operation {{to the process of}} petroleum refining, and a description of Thermal DeNOx, an environmental treatment system common to FCC units and other process units where high temperature furnaces are used. Next, this thesis will detail a project which I had the chance to lead as a process engineering intern at ExxonMobil’s Baton Rouge Refinery in the fall of 2016. The objective of the project was to optimize Thermal <b>DeNOx</b> <b>systems</b> installed on two FCC units at the refinery. Experiments were conducted on these units at different chemical injection rates and temperatures, {{in order to determine the}} operating parameters at which the Thermal <b>DeNOx</b> <b>systems</b> were as efficient and economical as possible. A control scheme was implemented on the unit to maintain operation at these experimentally determined parameters, with a projected economic benefit of $ 250, 000 per year for the refinery.

40|$|AbstractSelective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) DeNOx is {{the main}} flue gas {{denitrification}} technology, and the efficiency of SCR <b>DeNOx</b> <b>system</b> depends on whether the flue gas and ammonia distributions of the velocity and concentration fields are uniform in the reactor. Combined with the porous medium model and component transport equations, the numerical simulations were carried on for the SCR system of the 1000 MW coal-fired station, and the velocity fields and concentration fields in different cases were obtained. The results showed that: the corner vane cascades and rectifier grills installed, the non-uniformity of flue gas velocity is less than 15 % at the catalyst inlet within the reactor. Under {{the premise of the}} best flow field, the vortex mixers can ensure the full blending of the ammonia and flue gas in the reactor. The reliability of numerical simulation is verified through the cold model test, and then the design of the SCR system is guided effectively by the numerical simulations...|$|R
40|$|A {{combined}} spectroscopic and catalytic {{study of}} the NO reactivity on microporous aluminophosphates, with chabasite-related structure, CoAPO- 34, CuAPO- 34 and CuAPSO- 34, is reported. NO and CO adsorption were monitored by FTIR spectroscopy, and revealed that Co 2 +/Co 3 + and Cu+/Cu 2 + redox couples, the sites responsible for the catalytic activity, are present in these catalysts. CoAPO- 34 catalysts showed exceptionally high performances in the oxidation of NO to NO 2, and poor activity in <b>other</b> <b>DeNO(x)</b> reactions. Copper-based aluminophosphates and silico-aluminophosphates, besides good performances in the NO oxidation to NO 2, showed good activity in the N 2 O decomposition even {{in the presence of}} oxygen or water in the feed. The presence of silicon has beneficial effects both on the thermal and hydrothermal stability of the zeolitic structure, {{as well as on the}} catalytic performances of the metal-aluminophosphates.

40|$|SNCR (Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction) {{technology}} {{is aimed at}} reducing NOx emissions. SNCR efficiency is appropriately high only for the reaction temperature range called ‘the SNCR temperature window’. It is a narrow temperature range defined in various ways in the literature, which {{makes it difficult to}} evaluate the <b>DeNOx</b> <b>system’s</b> efficiency. Therefore, this study attempts to approximate the relationship between SNCR system efficiency and the flue gas temperature. The approximation was performed on the basis of literature data and verified using data from an experiment. Measurements were performed in a Polish boiler with a maximum continuous rating of 230 t/h. The verified, evaluated function could be used to forecast efficiency of SNCR systems in existing units that use urea or ammonia as a reagent. The approximation results are polynomial functions that depend on flue gas temperature, which fit the literature data with the coefficient of determination R 2 = 0. 83 - 0. 86. Therefore, these equations could be used by the designer or operator of the boiler for preliminary determination of current SNCR system efficiency...|$|R

40|$|All {{over the}} world, {{there is an}} {{increasing}} drive to develop new technologies or concepts for industrial glass melting furnaces, with the main aim to increase the energy efficiency, tabilize production and reduce emissions. The application of new process sensors, improved furnace design, intelligent control strategy and waste gas heat recovery systems support the glass manufacturers to achieve ever increasing requirements concerning energy efficiency and emission limits. Glass industries are searching for breakthrough innovations (revolution), but introduction of such major changes in industry is hampered by large risks and investments. Therefore most companies prefer a stepwise improvement (evolution) based on existing concepts, such a regenerative glass furnaces. When different technologies are combined, it will even be possible, in specific cases, to avoid the use of flue gas scrubbers or <b>DeNOx</b> <b>systems.</b> An overview of requirements for industrial glass furnaces is given concerning melting characteristics and performance of the furnaces. A short overview of evolutionary and revolutionary developments in industrial glass melting processes will be presented.

40|$|The {{environmental}} impacts of rotary kiln incineration, which is widely used in China for treating industrial hazardous waste (IHW), is evaluated in this work through life cycle assessment (LCA). Emissions data of key pollutants, along with energy and material inputs and outputs of rotary kiln incineration, were collected from a commercial-scale operating IHW incineration plant located in Hangzhou city in eastern China, and the corresponding {{environmental impacts}} were analyzed based on the LCA model. It is concluded that the IHW incineration process has {{the greatest impact on}} human toxicity, followed by global warming. Heavy metals, especially Pb and As, are the main contributors to human toxicity, while CO 2 is the main cause of global warming. PCDD/Fs have a relatively small contribution to human toxicity and overall environmental safety. This study has two improvement suggestions based on the assessment results: An energy recovery <b>system</b> and a <b>DeNOx</b> <b>system</b> should be added to the IHW incineration process, since the former would reduce the contribution of IHW incineration to global warming, while the latter would enable incineration plants to minimize the emissions of NOx; Fly ash and bottom ash should be stabilized and further treated to mitigate the problems caused by heavy metals...|$|R
40|$|NH 3 is a {{precursor}} of PM 2. 5 which deteriorates urban air quality, affects {{human health and}} impacts the global radiation budget. Since vehicles are important sources of NH 3 in urban areas, we have satisfactorily studied the possibility of measuring NH 3 emissions from gasoline and SCR-equipped diesel light duty vehicles during real driving on-road operation using a portable FTIR. The performance of the portable FTIR resulted to be {{comparable to that of}} a laboratory-based FTIR during a series of experiments performed in the Vehicle Emission Laboratory (VELA) using the World-harmonized Light-duty Test Cycle (WLTC). Higher on-road NH 3 emission factors were obtained for the gasoline vehicle than for the diesel. High NOx emissions were measured from the diesel vehicle, indicating a low efficiency of the <b>DeNOx</b> <b>system,</b> SCR. On-road NH 3 emission factors were ~ 2 times lower than during the laboratory tests at 23 C for both vehiclesNH 3 emissions were not observed for the diesel vehicle during cold start operation. However, NH 3 cold start emissions from the gasoline vehicle were up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than during the entire road trips, ranging from 45 to 134 mg km- 1. Cold start emissions are of paramount importance as they commonly take place in urban areas. Hence, future urban reductions in PM 2. 5 might need to take into consideration the introduction of NH 3 emissions limits for passenger cars. JRC. C. 4 -Sustainable Transpor...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{increased}} SO 2 to SO 3 oxidation {{due to the}} installation of an SCR on many units in the United States that burn high sulfur coal was more significant than expected. Soon after the SCR start up on Gavin Units 1 and 2, AEP recognized this issue and began the evaluation of several mitigation techniques and technologies to reduce SO 3 emissions. At the same time, the development of low SO 2 to SO 3 conversion rate catalyst {{became one of the}} most important research projects for catalyst manufacturers. After extensive research work, Babcock-Hitachi developed low SO 2 to SO 3 conversion rate catalyst while maintaining high DeNOx activity Identification of the Necessity for Low SO 2 to SO 3 Conversion Rate Catalyst The first catalytic <b>DeNOx</b> <b>system</b> for large utility boilers was commissioned for operation in 1977 in Japan. Since then, SCR applications have been applied for various fuels such as gas, oil and coal, and the installations have expanded to many industrialized countries around the world. In the past several years, the SCR units in the US that burn high sulfur (3 - 7 %) Eastern Bituminous coal experienced operational difficulties such as severe blue plume generation and acid mist emission. The increased SO 3 concentration also causes: acceleration of corrosion of downstream equipments, increased possibility of ammonium bisulfate (ABS) formation within air preheater elements and increased PM emission. To overcome this problem, several research efforts to reduce SO 3 emissions were conducted such as injecting different additives. The development of low SO 2 to SO 3 conversion rate catalyst can be a very cost effective solution to minimize the production of SO 3...|$|R
