25|$|The {{existence}} <b>of</b> <b>PIE</b> {{was first}} postulated in the 18th century by Sir William Jones, who observed {{the similarities between}} Sanskrit, Ancient Greek, and Latin. By the early 20th century, well-defined descriptions <b>of</b> <b>PIE</b> had been developed that are still accepted today (with some refinements). The largest developments of the 20th century were {{the discovery of the}} Anatolian and Tocharian languages and the acceptance of the laryngeal theory. The Anatolian languages have also spurred a major re-evaluation of theories concerning the development of various shared Indo-European language features {{and the extent to which}} these features were present in PIE itself. Relationships to other language families, including the Uralic languages, have been proposed but remain controversial.|$|E

25|$|Some of the {{differences}} between the texts are just varying spelling conventions: w and , for example, are only different ways to indicate the same sound, a consonantal u. However, many other differences are to be explained by widely diverging views on the phonological and morphological systems <b>of</b> <b>PIE.</b>|$|E
25|$|This stage {{began its}} {{evolution}} as a dialect of Proto-Indo-European {{that had lost}} its laryngeals and had five long and six short vowels {{as well as one}} or two overlong vowels. The consonant system was still that <b>of</b> <b>PIE</b> minus palatovelars and laryngeals, but the loss of syllabic resonants already made the language markedly different from PIE proper. Mutual intelligibility might have still existed with other descendants <b>of</b> <b>PIE,</b> {{but it would have been}} strained, and the period marked the definitive break of Germanic from the other Indo-European languages and the beginning of Germanic proper, containing most of the sound changes that are now held to define this branch distinctively. This stage contained various consonant and vowel shifts, the loss of the contrastive accent inherited from PIE for a uniform accent on the first syllable of the word root, and the beginnings of the reduction of the resulting unstressed syllables.|$|E

40|$|In the Ultimatum Game, {{two players}} are offered {{a chance to}} win a pie. The {{proposer}} suggests how to split the pie. The responder can either accept or reject the deal. If an agreement is not reached, neither player gets anything. Both game theory and evolutionary game theory predict the rational solution that the proposer offers the smallest possible share and the responder accepts it. Fairness thus requires additional mechanisms for natural selection to favor it. Studies to date assumed that individuals have competed for the fixed size <b>of</b> <b>pies,</b> in sharp contrast with real situations, where randomness is ubiquitous. Here we study the impact of random allocation <b>of</b> <b>pies</b> on the evolution of fairness in the Ultimatum Game. Interestingly, we find that the evolution of fairness can be promoted by the randomness associated with the size <b>of</b> <b>pies,</b> without the support of any additional evolutionary mechanisms...|$|R

25|$|Old Irish also {{preserves}} most {{aspects of}} the complicated Proto-Indo-European (PIE) system of morphology. Nouns and adjectives are declined in three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter); three numbers (singular, dual, plural); and five cases (nominative, vocative, accusative, dative and genitive). Most PIE noun stem classes are maintained (o-, yo-, ā-, yā-, i-, u-, r-, n-, s-, and consonant stems). Most of the complexities <b>of</b> <b>PIE</b> verbal conjugation are also maintained, and there are new complexities introduced by various sound changes (see below).|$|E
25|$|In {{all these}} cases the {{supporters}} of the Centum character of the Illyrian language consider PIE *ḱ > /*k/ or PIE *ǵ > /*g/ followed by an /l/ or /r/ to be evidence of a Centum character of the Illyrian language. However, {{it has been shown}} that even in Albanian and Balto-Slavic, which are Satem languages, in this phonetical position the palatovelars have been generally depalatized (the depalatization <b>of</b> <b>PIE</b> *ḱ > *k and *ǵ > *g before /r/ and /l/ regularly in Albanian).|$|E
25|$|PIE nouns and {{adjectives}} (as well as pronouns) {{are subject}} to the system <b>of</b> <b>PIE</b> nominal inflection with eight or nine cases: nominative, accusative, vocative, genitive, dative, instrumental, ablative, locative, and possibly a directive or allative. The so-called strong or direct cases are the nominative and the vocative for all numbers, and the accusative case for singular and dual (and possibly plural as well), and the rest are the weak or oblique cases. This classification is relevant for inflecting the athematic nominals of different accent/ablaut classes.|$|E

25|$|Scholars {{estimate}} that PIE {{may have been}} spoken as a single language (before divergence began) around 3500 BCE, though estimates by different authorities can vary {{by more than a}} millennium. A number of hypotheses have been proposed for the origin and spread of the language, the most popular among linguists being the Kurgan hypothesis, which postulates an origin in the Pontic–Caspian steppe of Eastern Europe. Features of the culture of the speakers <b>of</b> <b>PIE,</b> known as Proto-Indo-Europeans, have also been reconstructed based on the shared vocabulary of the early attested Indo-European languages.|$|E

25|$|Merging <b>of</b> <b>PIE</b> short *o and *a into *a or *o. This change also {{occurred}} {{in several other}} Indo-European branches, but here too it must have happened after Winter's law: Winter's law lengthens *o to *ō and *a to *ā, and must therefore have occurred before the two sounds merged. It also followed the raising of *o to *u above. It is to be noted that both vowels merged differently in both groups: Baltic languages have a in both cases, but Slavic ones have o (compare Lith. ašìs with old. Sl. ось (from Ide. *a: Latin axis, Greec ἄζων); Lith. avìs, old Slavic овьца (from Ide. *ŏ: Latin ovis, Greec ὄις). The Indoeuropean long vowels *ā and *ō merged only in the Slavic group, and later only in old Prussian.|$|E
