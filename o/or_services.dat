5|$|Commoners {{known as}} guests and {{retainers}} (binke 賓客) {{who lived on}} the property of a host in exchange for services had existed since the Warring States period. Retainers often originally belonged to other social groups, and sometimes they were fugitives seeking shelter from authorities. Hosts were often wealthy nobles and officials, yet they were sometimes wealthy commoners. In a typical relationship, a host provided lodging, food, clothing, and carriage transport for his retainers in return for occasional and non-routine work <b>or</b> <b>services</b> such as an advisory role, a post as bodyguard, menial physical labor around the house, and sometimes more dangerous missions such as committing assassinations, fighting off roving bandits, or riding into battle to defend the host.

These eventually became circular in shape, which were in turn followed by die struck coins. Uncoined metals, particularly gold and silver, were used for trading as well. Patterns of elephants, horses, swastika and Dharmacakra were commonly imprinted on the coins of this period.|$|E

Joehana used real-life Bandung locations in his novels, and local figures prominent in the news (such as the pickpocket Salim) are mentioned in passing.

40|$|The classic {{definition}} of quality is “the {{ability of a}} product <b>or</b> <b>service</b> to consistently meet or exceed a customer’s expectations. ” An important element of the definition, customer’s expectations, requires further defining since cus-tomers value certain aspects of a product <b>or</b> <b>service</b> and they therefore associate those aspects with its quality. Product <b>or</b> <b>service</b> quality has many facets. Quality might include the following elements: • Performance or the main characteristic of the product <b>or</b> <b>service.</b> • Aesthetics, which include the “look and feel ” of the product <b>or</b> <b>service.</b> • Special features of the product <b>or</b> <b>service.</b> • Conformance <b>or</b> how well the product <b>or</b> <b>service</b> aligns with the customer’s expectations. • Safety, which includes the element of risk of injury or harm. • Reliability {{or the ability to}} consistently deliver the intended results. • Durability or the useful life of the prod-uct <b>or</b> <b>service.</b> • Reputation of the product <b>or</b> <b>service.</b> Different customers will have differ-ent expectations of a product <b>or</b> <b>service</b> based on the relative value they place on these components at a given moment in time. To make a determination of the quality of an educational program, one must identify the customers and their expectations of the program as they relate to the facets they deem most important. This is particularly true when a program, such as technology education, purports a significant change in it focus, content, and importance. In essence, the perceived quality of the new program will be influ-enced by the reputation of the program it has replaced, its academic home, and the faculty associated with the program...|$|R
