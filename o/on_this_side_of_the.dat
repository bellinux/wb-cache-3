5|$|A route {{popular with}} {{experienced}} hillwalkers starts at Torlundy, {{a few miles}} north-east of Fort William on the A82 road, and follows the path alongside the Allt a' Mhuilinn. It can also be reached from Glen Nevis by following the Pony Track as far as Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe, then descending slightly to the CIC Hut. The route then ascends Càrn Mòr Dearg and continues along the Càrn Mòr Dearg Arête ("CMD Arête") before climbing steeply to the summit of Ben Nevis. This route involves a total of 1,500 metres of ascent and requires modest scrambling ability and a head for heights. In common with other approaches <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountain, it {{has the advantage of}} giving an extensive view of the cliffs of the north face, which are hidden from the Pony Track.|$|E
5|$|On {{the right}} side of the altar are two retablos. The larger altar on {{the right side}} {{currently}} houses the image of St. Francis Xavier as preacher on the topmost level. On the middle level of the same retablo are images of Saint Vincent Ferrer in the center, and Saint Augustine and Saint Monica on the left and right niches, respectively. The lowest level contains images of the Nuestra Señora de la Consolacion in the center, Saint Anne to the right and Saint Thérèse of Lisieux (originally St Joachim) on the left. The smaller altar has two levels of baroque and neoclassical style, respectively, with images of the crucified Christ on the lower level and the Holy Infant on the upper. The tomb of Father Aquilino Bon and other Recollect priests who served Loboc are also <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church. The remains of Jesuit priest Alonso de Humanes were formerly interred in this area before the transfer of his remains to San Ignacio in Intramuros. An apocryphal account tells of a fire in a former Loboc church stopping at the foot of Humanes' tomb; this story spread across the people of the Loboc and nearby towns, which drew pilgrims to light candles in memory of Humanes.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} observed are congenital obstructive lesions {{of the left}} side of the heart, leading to reduced flow <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart. This includes bicuspid aortic valve and coarctation (narrowing) of the aorta. More than 50% of the cardiovascular malformations of individuals with Turner syndrome in one study were bicuspid aortic valves or coarctation of the aorta (usually preductal), alone or in combination.|$|E

60|$|The {{whole scene}} of sacred Prophecy is {{composed}} of three principal parts: the regions beyond Euphrates, represented by the two first Beasts of Daniel; the Empire <b>of</b> the Greeks <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Euphrates, represented by the Leopard and by the He-Goat; and the Empire <b>of</b> the Latins <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Greece, represented by the Beast with ten horns. And to these three parts, the phrases of the third part of the earth, sea, rivers, trees, ships, stars, sun, and moon, relate. I place {{the body of the}} fourth Beast <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Greece, because the three first of the four Beasts had their lives prolonged after their dominion was taken away, and therefore belong not to the body of the fourth. He only stamped them with his feet.|$|R
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the Palladianism of the West front, the East front is austere in its neoclassicism. It projects from the flanking pavilions, which <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house are partially screened by planting. The fenestration which is concentrated on the broad bay at {{the centre of the}} facade provides the essential rhythm and relief. Above the second floor, a balustrade not only hides the roof, but unites the projecting bay with its flanking bays.|$|E
25|$|By {{the age of}} 16 Gamani was 'vigorous, renowned, {{intelligent}} and a hero in majesty and might', if a little wayward. Determined to expel the invading king of Rajarata, Gamani levied an army from around Rohana and declared his intention to regain the north to his father. The king forbade this stating that 'the land <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river is enough'; the resulting exchange between father and son saw Gamani being dubbed 'Duttha Gamani', his friends fleeing to Malaya, and he himself being incarcerated in a royal prison.|$|E
25|$|The story then {{shifts to}} Susannah {{coming through the}} magic door to an {{alternate}} 1980s New York, where Gary Hart is president. Susannah throws away Roland's gun (which does not function <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> door), rejecting {{the life of a}} gunslinger, and starts a new life with alternate versions of Eddie and Jake, who in this world are brothers with the surname Toren. They have only very vague memories of their previous journey with Susannah, whose own memories of Mid-World are already beginning to fade. It is implied that an alternate version of Oy, the billy-bumbler, will also join them.|$|E

25|$|Natural {{vegetation}} {{is preserved}} {{in many parts}} of the district because of the unsuitability of steep land for cultivation. The district is at a natural geographic and climatic boundary. It is the southern limit for mangroves (Avicennia resinifera) <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North Island of New Zealand, the southern limit for the coastal tree taraire (Beilschmiedia taraire), and the mountains are the furthest north for many New Zealand alpine plants (Ranunculus insignis, Ourisia caespitosa etc.). A remnant sea-level stand of an alpine southern beech (Nothofagus solandri) exists at the head of Ohiwa Harbour, a drowned Ice Ages valley system.|$|E
25|$|Major {{sections}} of the city include the central business district, called The Loop, and the North, the South, and West Sides. The three sides of the city are represented on the Flag of Chicago by three horizontal white stripes. The North Side is the most densely populated residential section of the city, and many high-rises are located <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city along the lakefront. The South Side is the largest section of the city, encompassing roughly 60% of the city's land area.

25|$|Despite being {{regarded}} as Belgae, {{a type of}} Gaul, Julius Caesar says that the Condrusi, Eburones, Caeraesi, Paemani, and Segni were called by the collective name of Germani and had settled there some generations ago having come {{from the other side}} of the Rhine. The Eburones are therefore amongst the so-called Germani cisrhenani 'Germans <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rhine', i.e. Germanic peoples who lived south and west of the Rhine and may have been distinct from the Belgae. It is clear that the Belgic tribes of Gaul were culturally influenced by both Gaulish and Germanic neighbours, but the details, for example which languages they spoke, remains uncertain.|$|E
25|$|The right {{wall of the}} {{corridor}} show the scenes {{from the life of}} the Buddha. These include Sujata offering food to the Buddha with a begging bowl in white dress, Tapussa and Bhalluka next to the Buddha after they offering wheat and honey to the Buddha as monk, the future Buddha sitting alone under a tree, and the Buddha at a ploughing festival. One mural shows Buddha's parents trying to dissuade him from becoming a monk. Another shows the Buddha at the palace surrounded by men in dhoti and women in sari as his behavior presents the four signs that he is likely to renounce. <b>On</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corridor are also paintings that show the future Buddha as a baby with sage Asita with rishi-like looks. According to Spink, some of the Cave 16 paintings were left incomplete.|$|E
25|$|When a {{campaign}} (profectio) {{of the king}} is announced to the bishop (of Metz, in this case) the bishop will send an official to the abbot, and the abbot will assemble his ministeriales. He will inform them of the campaign, and they will assemble the following men and equipment...: one wagon with six cows and six men; one packhorse with saddle and equipment and two men, the leader and the driver...If the king moves the army to Italy, all the peasant farms shall contribute for that purpose their usual taxes (that is, probably an entire annual rent as an extraordinary tax). But if the army moves against Saxony, Flanders or elsewhere <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Alps, only half that amount will be given. From these additional taxes the wagons and pack animals will be loaded with rations and other items necessary for the journey.|$|E

25|$|The Gauls {{crossed the}} Alps and invaded {{northern}} Italy in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC, settling {{in the area}} that became known as Cisalpine Gaul ("Gaul <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Alps"). Although named after the Gauls, the region was mostly inhabited by indigenous tribes, namely the Ligures, Etruscans, Veneti and Euganei. Estimates by Beloch and Brunt suggest that in the 3rd century BC the Gaulish settlers of north Italy numbered between 130,000–140,000 out of a total population of about 1.4 million. According to Pliny and Livy, after the invasion of the Gauls, some of the Etruscans living in the Po Valley sought refuge in the Alps and became known as the Raeti. The Raeti inhabited the region of Trentino-Alto Adige, as well as eastern Switzerland and Tyrol in western Austria. The Ladins of north-eastern Italy and the Romansh people of Switzerland are said to be descended from the Raeti.|$|E
25|$|The Galata Bridge {{linked the}} old and newer {{parts of the city}} across the narrow estuary winding inland from the Golden Horn. On one side cobbled streets run up from the bridge to Topkapı Palace, and the {{government}} offices. On the other the bridge opens up to the Galata financial district, from which narrow streets wind up other hills to the fashionable Beyolu area and finally Taksim Square at the top. <b>On</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge the Armenian men concentrated in the Galata, Tunnel and Tarlabasi around Beyolu. An Ottoman mob, mainly made up of bashibazouks and softas (students from the theological seminaries), took over a hotel in the city of Constantinople and bombs and shots and missiles fairly rained upon the heads of the passersby, wounding many persons. The mob surrounding the bank extended to several villages on the Bosporus including Tepe bashi and on the Asiatic coast of the Sea of Marmara. The weapons used by the populace were clubs and knives. The ulemas and softas,” most of whom resided in Constantinople, rushed across the bridge towards Pera and Galata but were met by squads of cavalry who forced them back, thus confining their efforts at massacre to the Armenians in the close region.|$|E

500|$|The {{objectives}} of the expedition {{were published in the}} Scottish Geographical Magazine and in the RGS Geographical Journal, in October 1902. They included the establishment of a winter station [...] "as near to the South Pole as is practicable", deep sea and other research of the Antarctic Ocean, and systematic observations and research of meteorology, geology, biology, topography and terrestrial physics. The essentially Scottish character of the expedition was expressed in The Scotsman shortly before departure: [...] "The leader and all the scientific and nautical members of the expedition are Scots; the funds have been collected for the most part <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Border; it is a product of voluntary effort, and unlike the expedition which will be simultaneously employed in the exploration of the Antarctic, it owes nothing to Government help".|$|E

South of the Great Gulf is Huntington Ravine, with a rocky, precipitous headwall renowned for its rock and ice climbing. The slope then dips into the Ravine of Raymond Cataract, a non-glacial [...] "V-shaped" [...] valley with a notable waterfall. After this comes Tuckerman Ravine, with a uniform, smoother headwall that is known for its high-quality skiing. After passing the Gulf of Slides, a smaller and lesser-known cirque, the notch opens up and continues until Jackson.|$|E
