5|$|EFS {{has mostly}} a repressive role of EFS on {{processes}} {{associated with the}} activation of mature T-cells, including IL-2 pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and IL-2-dependent clonal expansion of T cells. Upon T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, EFS dephosphorylation and release of the SRC family kinase FYN and phospholipase C-γ normally lead to self-limitation of the immune response. Consistent with this mechanism, EFS <b>overexpression</b> in T cell-derived cell lines decreased IL-2 concentration in supernatants in response to TCR stimulation, while T cells derived from mice lacking EFS gene showed increased IL-2 production. A dual role of EFS in mature T cells function has been proposed because both <b>overexpression</b> and siRNA knockdown of this protein in cell models resulted in decreased transcriptional activation of IL-2 dependent promoters following TCR stimulation.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are first}} {{visible from the}} 13th to the 16th week of fetal development, as bulgings off hair follicles. Sebaceous glands develop from the same tissue that {{gives rise to the}} {{epidermis}} of the skin. <b>Overexpression</b> of the signalling factors Wnt, Myc and SHH all increase the likelihood of sebaceous gland presence.|$|E
5|$|These GTPases {{regulate}} cell motility, {{proliferation and}} {{also contribute to}} tumor progression and invasion. In many cell types, NEDD9 <b>overexpression</b> increases spreading and crescent morphology (an indicator of high motility). However, in fibroblasts, some work has found that absence of NEDD9 leads to more rapid focal adhesion turnover, which led to increase of migration in NEDD9-/- compared to wild type.|$|E
25|$|When it was {{understood}} that DCC apoptosis may also be overcome by netrin-1 <b>overexpression,</b> colorectal cancers were assessed for netrin-1 <b>overexpression,</b> and a small but significant percent of these cancers were found to vastly overexpress the molecule.|$|E
25|$|<b>Overexpression</b> of IGF2 can be {{responsible}} for overgrowth, and generally, IGF2 is expressed {{in the absence of}} H19.|$|E
25|$|Gene {{knockdown}} of FOXP2 in Area X of the {{basal ganglia}} in songbirds results in incomplete and inaccurate song imitation. <b>Overexpression</b> of FoxP2 was accomplished through injection of adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (AAV1) into Area X of the brain. This <b>overexpression</b> produced similar effects {{to that of}} knockdown; juvenile zebra finch birds were unable to accurately imitate their tutors. Similarly, in adult canaries higher FOXP2 levels also correlate with song changes.|$|E
25|$|Many human tumors {{occur because}} of dysregulation of mTOR signaling, and can confer higher {{susceptibility}} to inhibitors of mTOR. Deregulations of multiple {{elements of the}} mTOR pathway, like PI3K amplification/mutation, PTEN loss of function, AKT <b>overexpression,</b> and S6K1, 4EBP1, and eIF4E <b>overexpression</b> have been related to many types of cancers. Therefore, mTOR is an interesting therapeutic target for treating multiple cancers, both the mTOR inhibitors themselves or in combination with inhibitors of other pathways.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to explore the role of PEPCK, {{researchers}} caused the <b>overexpression</b> of PEPCK in E. coli bacteria via recombinant DNA.|$|E
25|$|A {{previous}} {{study conducted by}} Adriaenssens et al. on H19 correlated an <b>overexpression</b> of H19 {{with the presence of}} steroid receptors.|$|E
25|$|Down {{syndrome}} {{is a medical}} condition characterized by an <b>overexpression</b> of cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) and {{a low level of}} homocysteine in the blood.|$|E
25|$|In mice, {{the story}} is {{somewhat}} similar. Deleting antioxidant enzymes, in general, yields shorter lifespan, though <b>overexpression</b> studies have not (with some recent exceptions) consistently extended lifespan.|$|E
25|$|Accordingly, coexpression of {{anti-apoptotic}} proteins such as Mcl-1 suppresses apoptosis {{induced by}} Bok <b>overexpression.</b> Consistent {{with the results}} mentioned above, coexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 does not prevent Bok-induced apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|Abnormal {{growth factor}} {{signaling}} in {{the interaction between}} stromal cells and epithelial cells can facilitate malignant cell growth. In breast adipose tissue, <b>overexpression</b> of leptin leads to increased cell proliferation and cancer.|$|E
25|$|A {{different}} study noted <b>overexpression</b> of QSER1 in pathological cardiomyopathy. This {{condition is}} associated with altered expression of genes involved in immune responses, signaling, cell growth, and proliferation as well as infiltration of B lymphocytes.|$|E
25|$|This {{indicates}} {{that the loss of}} H19 is not lethal, H19 expression governs IGF2 repression, and the <b>overexpression</b> of IGF2 is responsible for the overgrowth phenotype observed in the maternal inheritance of a deleted H19 gene.|$|E
25|$|Researchers at Case Western Reserve University have {{discovered}} that <b>overexpression</b> of cytosolic PEPCK in skeletal muscle of mice causes {{them to be more}} active, more aggressive, and have longer lives than normal mice; see metabolic supermice.|$|E
25|$|DCC's {{role as a}} tumour {{suppressor}} is tied to its dependence receptor characteristics. DCC induces {{cell death}} on epithelial cells when no netrin-1 is bound. Besides from loss of heterozygosity of DCC, this mechanism of apoptosis can also be avoided in malignant processes by <b>overexpression</b> of netrin-1.|$|E
25|$|All {{scarring}} {{is composed}} of the same collagen as the tissue it has replaced, but {{the composition of the}} scar tissue, compared to the normal tissue, is different. Scar tissue also lacks elasticity unlike normal tissue which distributes fiber elasticity. Scars differ in the amounts of collagen overexpressed. Labels have been applied to the differences in <b>overexpression.</b> Two of the most common types are hypertrophic and keloid scarring, both of which experience excessive stiff collagen bundled growth overextending the tissue, blocking off regeneration of tissues. Another form is atrophic scarring (sunken scarring), which also has an <b>overexpression</b> of collagen blocking regeneration. This scar type is sunken, because the collagen bundles do not overextend the tissue. Stretch marks (striae) are regarded as scars by some.|$|E
25|$|Mutations in and <b>overexpression</b> of ion {{channels}} are important events in cancer cells. In Glioblastoma multiforme, upregulation of gBK potassium channels and ClC-3 chloride channels enables glioblastoma cells to migrate within the brain, which {{may lead to}} the diffuse growth patterns of these tumors.|$|E
25|$|Oncomirs are {{associated}} with carcinogenesis, malignant transformation, and metastasis. Some oncomir genes are oncogenes, in that <b>overexpression</b> of the gene leads to cancerous growth. Other oncomir genes are tumor suppressors in a normal cell, so that underexpression of the gene leads to cancerous growth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Overexpression</b> of a {{truncated}} splice {{variant of}} the FOSB gene – ΔFosB – in a specific population of neurons in the nucleus accumbens {{has been identified as}} the causal mechanism involved in the induction and maintenance of an addiction to drugs and natural rewards.|$|E
25|$|PEPCK-C catalyzes an {{irreversible}} step of gluconeogenesis, {{the process}} whereby glucose is synthesized. The enzyme has therefore been {{thought to be}} essential in glucose homeostasis, as evidenced by laboratory mice that contracted diabetes mellitus type 2 {{as a result of}} the <b>overexpression</b> of PEPCK-C.|$|E
25|$|Lottin et al. {{also found}} that the <b>overexpression</b> of H19 {{positively}} regulates post-transcriptionally thioredoxin. Thioredoxin is a protein crucial to the reduction-oxidation reactions involved in metabolism within a cell, and is often found at high levels in cancerous tissues that also overexpress H19 RNA.|$|E
25|$|Downstream, the mTOR effectors S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), {{eukaryotic}} {{initiation factor}} 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) {{are related to}} cellular transformation. S6K1 is a key regulator of cell growth and also phosphorylates other important targets. Both eIF4E and S6K1 are included in cellular transformation and their <b>overexpression</b> {{has been linked to}} poor cancer prognosis.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} signals that {{regulate}} the molecular biology of the process. The following three genes in Arabidopsis thaliana possess both common and independent functions in floral transition: FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), LEAFY (LFY), SUPPRESSOR OF <b>OVEREXPRESSION</b> OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1, also called AGAMOUS-LIKE20). SOC1 is a MADS-box-type gene, which integrates responses to photoperiod, vernalization and gibberellins.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also an}} <b>overexpression</b> of IgG-free kappa {{light chain}} protein in both CIS and RR-MS patients, {{compared}} with control subjects, together with an increased expression of an isoforms of apolipoprotein E in RR-MS. Expression of some specific proteins in circulating CD4+ T cells is {{a risk factor for}} conversion from CIS to clinically defined multiple sclerosis.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} speculated that cystathionine beta synthase <b>overexpression</b> could be the major culprit in this disease (along with {{dysfunctioning}} of GabaA and Dyrk1a). The phenotype of down syndrome {{is the opposite of}} Hyperhomocysteinemia (described below). Pharmacologicals inhibitors of CBS have been patented by the Jerome Lejeune Foundation (November 2011) and trials (animals and humans are planned).|$|E
25|$|Programmed {{cell death}} {{can be reduced}} or {{eliminated}} in the developing nervous system by the targeted deletion of pro-apoptotic genes or by the <b>overexpression</b> of anti-apoptotic genes. The absence or reduction of PCD can cause serious anatomical malformations but can also result in minimal consequences depending on the gene targeted, neuronal population, and stage of development. Excess progenitor cell proliferation that leads to gross brain abnormalities is often lethal, as seen in caspase-3 or caspase-9 knockout mice which develop exencephaly in the forebrain. The brainstem, spinal cord, and peripheral ganglia of these mice develop normally, however, suggesting that the involvement of caspases in PCD during development depends on the brain region and cell type. Knockout or inhibition of apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (APAF1), also results in malformations and increased embryonic lethality. Manipulation of apoptosis regulator proteins Bcl-2 and Bax (<b>overexpression</b> of Bcl-2 or deletion of Bax) produces {{an increase in the}} number of neurons in certain regions of the nervous system such as the retina, trigeminal nucleus, cerebellum, and spinal cord. However, PCD of neurons due to Bax deletion or Bcl-2 <b>overexpression</b> does not result in prominent morphological or behavioral abnormalities in mice. For example, mice overexpressing Bcl-2 have generally normal motor skills and vision and only show impairment in complex behaviors such as learning and anxiety. The normal behavioral phenotypes of these mice suggest that an adaptive mechanism may be involved to compensate for the excess neurons.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, {{the protein}} Bcl-2-related ovarian killer (Bok) was {{identified}} in a yeast two-hybrid experiment with a rat ovarian cDNA library in a screen for proteins interacting with Mcl-1, an abundant anti-apoptotic protein. The <b>overexpression</b> of Bok induces apoptosis. Because {{of its high}} sequence similarity to Bak and Bax, Bok is classified {{as a member of}} the Bcl-2 protein family.|$|E
25|$|The human BOK {{promoter}} {{is activated}} by the <b>overexpression</b> {{of members of}} the E2F hand transcription factor family. Typically, these transcription factors are involved in the promotion of S-phase, so there might be a connection between Bok expression and cell cycle progression. Due to this regulation of Bok expression by the cell cycle, it was proposed that Bok sensitizes growing cells to stress-induced apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|The above {{experimental}} expression {{data shows}} many possible findings for CCDC142. <b>Overexpression</b> of SNAI1, a zinc finger protein, is correlated to {{the reduction of}} CCDC142 expression in Homo sapiens. A Mus musculus knockout of MEKK 2/3, which help regulate helper T cell differentiation, also showed lowered expression of CCDC142. Another Mus musculus experiment focusing on cardiomyopathy in mice showed lower levels of CCDC142 in mice with damaged myocardial cells.|$|E
25|$|Differential {{expression}} of QSER1 {{is seen in}} multiple cancer conditions. <b>Overexpression</b> of QSER1 was noted in Burkitt’s Lymphoma. QSER1 expression also increases with increasing Gleason score (more advanced stages) of prostate cancer. In a study on breast cancer response to paclitaxel and fluorouracil‐doxorubicin‐cyclophosphamide chemotherapy, {{it was noted that}} breast cancer lines with higher levels of QSER1 were more likely to respond to treatment than those with under{{expression of}} QSER1.|$|E
25|$|There are {{multiple}} studies that link FAM83A <b>overexpression</b> to lung, prostate, and bladder cancers. Researchers {{believe that this}} gene might make {{a good candidate for}} early detection of these cancers, especially lung cancer. It is unknown why or how FAM83A is upregulated. Studies have shown that arsenic can acetylate the promoter causing upregulation, suggesting this may be a similar mechanism to how this gene becomes unregulated in cancer.|$|E
25|$|An {{abnormal}} metabolism {{or change}} in the expression of sulfatide has also been associated with various pathologies, including neuropathologies, such as metachromatic leukodystrophy, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Sulfatide is also associated with diabetes mellitus, cancer metastasis, and viruses, including HIV-1, influenza A virus, hepatitis C and vaccinia virus. Additionally, <b>overexpression</b> of sulfatide {{has been linked to}} epilepsy and audiogenic seizures as well as other pathological states in the nervous system.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, out of 119 {{cases of}} {{mismatch}} repair-deficient colorectal cancers that lacked DNA repair gene PMS2 expression, PMS2 was deficient in 6 due to mutations in the PMS2 gene, while in 103 cases PMS2 expression was deficient because its pairing partner MLH1 was repressed due to promoter methylation (PMS2 protein is unstable {{in the absence}} of MLH1). In the other 10 cases, loss of PMS2 expression was likely due to epigenetic <b>overexpression</b> of the microRNA, miR-155, which down-regulates MLH1.|$|E
25|$|Upstream, PI3K/AKT {{signalling}} is deregulated {{through a}} variety of mechanisms, including <b>overexpression</b> or activation of growth factor receptors, such as HER-2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) and IGFR (insulin-like growth factor receptor), mutations in PI3K and mutations/amplifications of AKT. Tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a negative regulator of PI3K signaling. In many cancers the PTEN expression is decreased and may be downregulated through several mechanisms, including mutations, loss of heterozygosity, methylation, and protein instability.|$|E
