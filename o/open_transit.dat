50|$|Following the US {{acquisition}} of Upper California and the Oregon Territory in 1846 and the prospective movement of many more settlers {{to and from}} the West Coast, the United States once again turned its attention to securing a safe, reliable, and speedy link between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. In 1846 the United States signed a treaty with Colombia (then the Republic of New Granada) by which the US guaranteed Colombian sovereignty over Panama and was authorized to build a railroad or canal at the Panamanian isthmus guaranteeing its <b>open</b> <b>transit.</b>|$|E

50|$|With {{financial}} assistance arranged by Philippe Bunau-Varilla, a French national representing {{the interests of}} Lesseps's company, the native Panamanian leaders conspired {{to take advantage of}} United States interest in a new regime on the isthmus. In October and November 1903, the revolutionary junta, with the protection of United States naval forces, carried out a successful uprising against the Colombian government. Acting, paradoxically, under the Mallarino-Bidlack Treaty of 1846 between the United States and Colombia—which provided that United States forces could intervene in the event of disorder on the isthmus to guarantee Colombian sovereignty and <b>open</b> <b>transit</b> across the isthmus—the United States prevented a Colombian force from moving across the isthmus to Panama City to suppress the insurrection.|$|E
40|$|Local {{vehicular}} traffic {{is responsible for}} a substantial fraction of PM 10 in urban air mainly due to non-exhaust traffic emissions and resuspension from street surfaces (e. g. Zhao et al., 2006). In Northern areas (e. g. Scandinavia) street dust levels are especially high during spring, and the diurnal average PM 10 value (the EU directive) is exceeded more than the allowed 35 times per year. In this paper we introduce the sampling system of a mobile research laboratory SNIFFER for studying emission levels of respirable dust from street surfaces. We have measured a unique time series of the street level PM 10 concentrations {{in a city of}} Helsinki, Finland, during the last five springs. A special 20 km route in downtown was selected to cover main streets including bus lanes, tram lanes, canyon streets, <b>open</b> <b>transit</b> streets and some cobblestone covered streets. For every spring the maximun emission level averaged over the whole route was 2000 - 4500 mg/m- 3 and occurred in the turn from March to April, after which the clear decreasing trend was found. The most highest street concentrations were measured on the street canoyns {{as well as on the}} streets covered by copplestone and on the sections which were under work construction...|$|E

50|$|A {{restricted}} area may be closed for all purposes, <b>open</b> to <b>transit,</b> <b>open</b> to fishing {{for a specific}} period, or open to designated vessels only. Vessel speed is often the way its status is determined in lieu of direct observation. Some VMS directly report speed, or speed can be calculated by FMS software based on the time stamps of different position reports. A rule of thumb in scallop fisheries, for example, is that the vessel cannot be dredging for scallops if its speed is greater than 5 kn.|$|R

40|$|This Article {{examines}} some of {{the challenges}} presented by the transition from ‘closed’ to open data within the municipal context, using municipal transit data as a case study. The particular lens through which this Article examines these challenges is intellectual property law. In a ‘closed data’ system, intellectual property law is an important means by which legal control over data is asserted by governments and their agencies. In an ‘open data’ context, the freedom to use and distribute content is a freedom from IP constraints. The evolution of approaches to <b>open</b> municipal <b>transit</b> data offers some interesting examples of {{the role played by}} intellectual property at every stage in the evolution of <b>open</b> municipal <b>transit</b> data, and it highlights not just the relationship between municipalities and their residents, but also the complex relationships between municipalities, residents, and private-sector service providers...|$|R

The bank opened numerous branches including ones in Harar (1906), Dire Dawa (1908), Gore (1912), and Dese (1920). One of the first projects the bank financed was the Franco-Ethiopian Railway which reached Addis Ababa in 1917. The bank then <b>opened</b> a <b>transit</b> office in Djibouti in 1920.|$|R
