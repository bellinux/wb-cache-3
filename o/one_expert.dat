5|$|In December 2016, {{after it}} was {{announced}} that Phase 2 might cost $6 billion, transit experts expressed concern that the Second Avenue Subway might be so excessively costly as to preclude construction of Phases 3 and 4, as well as future expansions. <b>One</b> <b>expert</b> stated that the Phase 1 project was the most expensive subway project in the world, and that compared to other subway systems around the world, the cost of building new subways in New York City was much higher. The Second Avenue Subway's per-mile construction cost is higher than that of other projects in similar cities like London's Crossrail and Paris's Grand Paris Express, which themselves are among the most expensive underground-railway projects in the world. MTA officials stated that the Second Avenue Subway cost as much as it did only because of the complex underground infrastructure in Manhattan, as well as the fact that the New York City Subway runs all the time.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{any public}} animal exhibit must be {{licensed}} and inspected by the Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Depending on the animals they exhibit, {{the activities of}} zoos are regulated by laws including the Endangered Species Act, the Animal Welfare Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 and others. Additionally, zoos in North America may choose to pursue accreditation by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). To achieve accreditation, a zoo must pass an application and inspection process and meet or exceed the AZA's standards for animal health and welfare, fundraising, zoo staffing, and involvement in global conservation efforts. Inspection is performed by three experts (typically one veterinarian, <b>one</b> <b>expert</b> in animal care, and <b>one</b> <b>expert</b> in zoo management and operations) and then reviewed {{by a panel of}} twelve experts before accreditation is awarded. This accreditation process is repeated once every five years. The AZA estimates that there are approximately 2,400 animal exhibits operating under USDA license as of February 2007; fewer than 10% are accredited.|$|E
25|$|While herbicide-use {{has been}} {{proposed}} as one factor causing the decline in overwintering numbers of eastern monarchs, {{it is not the}} only possibility. Another is that the monarchs are experiencing problems reaching Mexico. This idea has been embraced by a number of leading monarch researchers, largely because of recent evidence showing that the number of breeding (adult) monarchs has not declined in the last two decades, based on long-term citizen science data. The lack of long-term declines in the numbers of breeding, and migratory monarchs, yet the clear declines in overwintering numbers, implies there is a disconnect between these life stages, that must be growing. <b>One</b> <b>expert</b> has proposed that a large and growing threat to migrating monarchs is mortality from car strikes.|$|E

25|$|Captain Schettino {{participated in}} three {{telephone}} calls with the cruise line's crisis management officer. At 22:26, Schettino told the Port of Livorno's harbour master {{that the ship}} had taken water through {{an opening in the}} port side and requested a tug boat. Port authorities were not alerted to the collision until 22:42, about an hour after the impact, and the order to evacuate the ship was not given until 22:50. Some passengers jumped into the water to swim to shore, while others, ready to evacuate the vessel, were delayed by crew members up to 45 minutes, as they resisted immediately lowering the lifeboats. Some sources report that the ship did not list until 23:15 and therefore if Schettino had given the order to abandon ship, the lifeboats could have been launched earlier, allowing the passengers to reach safety. In contrast, <b>one</b> <b>expert</b> stated that a delay might be justified considering the hazards in launching lifeboats while a ship is still moving.|$|E

500|$|The {{impact of}} Afroyim v. Rusk was narrowed by a later case, Rogers v.

However, the specific law at issue in Rogers v. Bellei—a requirement for a minimum period of U.S. residence that Bellei had failed to satisfy—was repealed by Congress in 1978. [...] As a consequence of revised policies adopted in 1990 by the United States Department of State, it is now (in the words of <b>one</b> <b>expert)</b> [...] "virtually impossible to lose American citizenship without formally and expressly renouncing it." ...|$|E

500|$|In March 1998 the Crime Commission {{released}} its findings, {{stating that the}} crimes that resulted in convictions occurred substantially in the way described to the courts, that no further charges would be laid as Webster had acted alone in both the murder and the assault that immediately preceded it, and that police had not acted inappropriately in their decision not to charge other persons. It did, however, criticise some police procedures and practices. The review did {{not comment on the}} discrepancies between Webster's confession and the forensic evidence, and it did not clarify whether forensic evidence was ever sent for testing. A representative for the Commission refused to comment on whether Wilson's blood-stained shirt was ever tested. <b>One</b> <b>expert</b> opinion obtained by the Commission wrote that it was [...] "likely [...] engaged in sexual behaviour which demeaned Leigh and to which he will never admit because he is ashamed and embarrassed", and Dr Johan Duflou said that a finger or penis was unlikely to have caused Leigh's severe genital damage. Hillary Byrne-Armstrong stated that these expert opinions, which contradict Webster's confession, raised questions on how the Commission concluded that Leigh's sexual assault occurred in the manner to which he had confessed, also raising doubts about several of the Commission's other findings. The Crime Commission released one of their two reports on the matter; their second unpublished report was handed over to the Police Integrity Commission (PIC) for investigation.|$|E

2500|$|Against a {{prevailing}} {{view that}} 18th-century Americans had not perpetuated the first settlers' passionate {{commitment to their}} faith, scholars now identify {{a high level of}} religious energy in colonies after 1700.
