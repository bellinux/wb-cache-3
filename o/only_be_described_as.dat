5|$|His {{behaviour}} {{on campaign}} can <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> perfectly honourable {{and at times}} humane, a trait which was illustrated during the French Revolutionary Wars, when he spared no effort to protect captured émigrés from {{the wrath of the}} Revolutionary radicals in the army. He also showed respect for occupied populations and never tolerated pillaging nor violence from his men. As a sign a gratitude, he was offered gifts several times but he was often seen refusing and sending them back. While on campaign in Tyrol, he was recorded to have accepted a large sum of money but he immediately distributed it to the local hospitals. Further evidence of his humanity was the care that he displayed for the lives and well-being of his men, whom he was always reluctant to sacrifice for the sake of glory.|$|E

It is preserved in the famous Auchinleck manuscript at the National Library of Scotland. The narrative largely follows the courtly tradition. As is true with many medieval English adaptations of French Arthuriana, the poem's artistic achievement can <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> average, though some critics have tried to rehabilitate it, claiming it is a parody.

500|$|Mark Bozon of IGN {{was highly}} {{critical}} of the game's dated graphics, found the overall gameplay very slow, and found the garbled voice work unsettling while enjoying the soundtrack. He concluded that, even as a fan of old school and abstract gameplay design, he had not enjoyed his time with the game. Lark Anderson, writing for GameSpot said there was [...] "never a dull moment" [...] due to the eccentric cast and story, and found the puzzle elements to be an entertaining challenge. His main complaints were the poor graphics, unresponsive camera system, lack of direction during navigation and the constant need for backtracking. Nintendo World Report's Nick DiMola noted the dialogue for its humor, but generally faulted most other aspects of the game; he called its graphics and sound low-quality, felt the gameplay was shallow, and found the puzzle solving segments a chore. He found it hard to recommend the title for any but dedicated fans of Suda's work. PALGN reviewer Ben Chev called the script [...] "well-written in what can <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> a typical Suda 51 style", and praised the music for its unique take on classical music. However he generally faulted the gameplay and called the graphics the worst he had seen for the DS.|$|E
500|$|The {{departure}} of the Mayflower and Speedwell for America was beset by delays. Further disagreements with the Merchant Adventurers held up the departure in Southampton. A total of 120 passengers finally departed on August 5—90 on the Mayflower and 30 on the Speedwell. Leaving Southampton, the Speedwell suffered significant leakage, which required the ships to immediately put in at Dartmouth. The leakage was partly caused by being overmasted and being pressed too much with sail. Repairs were completed, and a further delay ensued as they awaited favorable winds. The two ships finally set sail on August 23; they traveled only two hundred miles beyond Land's End before another major leak in the Speedwell forced the expedition to return again to England, this time to the port of Plymouth. The Speedwell {{was found to be}} unseaworthy; some passengers abandoned their attempt to emigrate, while others joined the Mayflower, crowding the already heavily burdened ship. Later, it was speculated that the crew of the Speedwell had intentionally sabotaged the ship to avoid having to make the treacherous trans-Atlantic voyage. The delays had significant consequences; the cost of the repairs and port fees required that the colonists sell some of their invaluable provisions. More importantly, the delays meant that everyone had to spend the entire winter on board the Mayflower off Cape Cod in what could <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> squalid conditions.|$|E

500|$|The Book of Lucifer {{contains}} {{the majority of}} the philosophy of The Satanic Bible. It details how Christianity has taught that God is good and Satan is evil, and presents an alternate view. It describes that the concept of Satan, used synonymously with [...] "God", is different for each LaVeyan Satanist, but that to all it represents a good and steadying force in his or her life. Believers have been called [...] "atheistic Satanists" [...] because of this lack of belief in external gods, but others identify as antitheistic. Satan is seen to LaVeyan Satanists not as [...] "an anthropomorphic being with cloven hooves, a barbed tail, and horns", but as a force of nature that has <b>only</b> <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> evil by other religions.

500|$|Critical {{reception}} of Results May Vary was mainly negative. The album received [...] "generally unfavorable reviews" [...] on Metacritic, {{with a score}} of 33 out of 100. This is the second lowest score on Metacritic, above only Kevin Federline's album Playing with Fire. According to AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, [...] "the music has no melody, hooks, or energy, [...] all {{attention is focused on}} the clown jumping up and down and screaming in front, and long before the record is over, you're left wondering, how the hell did he ever get to put this mess out?". In a review of Limp Bizkit's Greatest Hitz compilation, Erlewine called [...] "Behind Blue Eyes" [...] the worst in the band's [...] "never-ending series of embarrassing covers". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Durst's problems are ever-present - and does anybody still care?". Stylus criticized Results May Vary, calling it [...] "an album that can <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> abysmal". Rob O'Connor of Yahoo! Launch also criticized Results May Vary: [...] "No, Fred, the results don't vary. The results are consistent throughout your new album—consistently crappy." [...] Kitty Empire of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Limp Bizkit have decided to expose their tender side. They really shouldn't have bothered [...] having seen Limp Bizkit's 'other side', you want the old, unapologetic, meathead version back". Scott Mervis of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also criticized Results May Vary: [...] "Results May Vary has a few highlights — 'Almost Over' (very Everlast) and 'Phenomenon' (very Primus) — but way too few to justify all the time and energy spent".|$|E

[...] The story of the two Amish girls was deemed [...] "a little side story, which was actually quite touching and well written", being praised for the realistic portrayals and the effects the storyline had on Stevens. [...] "I don't think I've ever realized that Callie and Cristina never really interacted before. When they did speak to one another the episode, their personalities clash right away. At first they were snippy to one another but the two bonded after slicing open a runner's legs and then operating on him.", assessed West, in {{response to}} Torres and Yang's arc, which was described as [...] "an obvious parallel {{to the rest of}} the episode". West compared the reaction of Yang and Torres following the proposals, by noting that the former was [...] "surprised and maybe a little bit touched", whereas Torres expressed fear and concern: [...] "She's worried that he's only proposing because he's still getting over the loss of his dad and just needs someone to cling to. I adore George, but he's a mess right now and needs to get stuff straightened out before he makes any lifelong commitments." ...|$|E
500|$|Monteverdi is lauded {{by modern}} critics as [...] "the most {{significant}} composer in late Renaissance and early Baroque Italy"; [...] "one {{of the principal}} composers {{in the history of}} Western music"; and, routinely, as the first great opera composer. These assessments reflect a contemporary perspective, since his music was largely unknown to the composers that followed him for three centuries after his death. It is, as Redlich and others have pointed out, the composers of the late 20th and 21st century that have identified with Monteverdi and sought to make his music a basis for their own. Possibly, as Chew suggests, they are attracted by Monteverdi's reputation as [...] "a Modern, a breaker of rules, against the Ancients, those who deferred to ancient authority" [...] – although the composer was, essentially, a pragmatist, [...] "showing what can <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> an opportunistic and eclectic willingness to use whatever lay to hand for the purpose". In a letter dated 16 October 1633 Monteverdi appears to endorse the view of himself as a [...] "modern": [...] "I would rather be moderately praised for the new style than greatly praised for the ordinary". However, Chew, in his final summation, sees the composer historically as facing both ways, willing to use modern techniques but {{while at the same time}} protective of his status as a competent composer in the stile antico. Thus, says Chew, [...] "his achievement was both retrospective and progressive". Monteverdi represents the late Renaissance era while simultaneously summing up much of the early Baroque. [...] "And in one respect in particular, his achievement was enduring: the effective projection of human emotions in music, in a way adequate for theatre as well as for chamber music." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{girl from}} the {{previous}} animation is now an adult, wearing a bunny costume. She fights off a multitude of sci-fi monsters and mobile suits then jumps into a throng of Metron Seijin and tosses them aside. She is then in a lightsaber duel with Darth Vader, with Stormtroopers sitting {{in the background and}} the Death Star enshrined in one corner. From atop a cliff, a xenomorph with artificial legs, wielding the Discovery One, knocks the girl down with an energy burst and the Dynaman robot (Dyna Robo) attempts to crush her. The girl lifts Dyna Robo off her with superhuman strength and smashes it against a cliff. The Stormbringer suddenly appears in the sky, and the girl jumps on it, riding it like a surfboard. A few scenes unconnected to the main plot are shown, such as Yoda as Yū Ida given a Japanese comedy routine with various characters in the audience. The girl is still riding the Stormbringer when she runs into a formation of Ultrahawk 1's. Then the Yamato, the Arcadia attached to the transformed SDF-1 Macross appear, along with an exploding VF-1 Valkyrie variable fighter from Macross armed with a Gundam-style beam saber. An air battle unfolds in an otaku coffee shop. The girl is then seen in a world filled with American comic superheroes. A host of machines and characters (from The Lord of the Rings, Conan, Narnia, Pern, and others) fly past her into space, including a Klingon battle cruiser, the moon ship from H. G. Wells' First Men in the Moon, the Millennium Falcon, Lord Jaxom and the Thunderbirds. Once back on land, the girl jumps off the Stormbringer and it splits into seven parts, which fly though the sky spewing smoke in seven colors. A sequence of famous spaceships crashing into each other is shown. Then, suddenly, [...] "what could <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> an atomic bomb" [...] explodes over an unpopulated city, leaving behind a flurry of sakura petals. Successive upheavals of the Earth give birth to new worlds. As a beam launched by the Daicon traverses the sky, lush greenery sprouts and grows. The camera then pans over a massive crowd of fictional characters, the sun rises, the camera zooms out to the solar system, and the film ends with an image of the Daicon logo.|$|E
500|$|Grant's [...] "immaculate comic performance" [...] (BBC) as the trust-funded womaniser, Will Freeman, in {{the film}} {{adaptation}} of Nick Hornby's best-selling novel About a Boy received raves from critics. Almost universally praised, with an Academy Award-nominated screenplay, About a Boy (2002) {{was determined by the}} Washington Post to be [...] "that rare romantic comedy that dares to choose messiness over closure, prickly independence over fetishised coupledom, and honesty over typical Hollywood endings." [...] Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "The acid comedy of Grant's performance carries the film [...] gives this pleasing heartbreaker the touch of gravity it needs," [...] while Roger Ebert observed that [...] "the Cary Grant department is understaffed, and Hugh Grant shows here that he is more than a star, he is a resource." [...] Released a day after the blockbuster , About a Boy was a more modest box office grosser than other successful Grant films, making all of $129million globally. The film earned Grant his third Golden-Globe nomination, while the London Film Critics Circle named Grant its Best British Actor and GQ honoured him as one of the magazine's men of the year 2006. [...] "His performance can <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> revelatory," [...] wrote critic Ann Hornaday, adding that [...] "Grant lends the shoals layer upon layer of desire, terror, ambivalence and self-awareness." [...] The New York Observer concluded: [...] " [...] gets most of its laughs from the evolved expertise of Hugh Grant in playing characters that audiences enjoy seeing taken down a peg or two as a punishment for philandering and womanising and simply being too handsome for words-and with an English accent besides. In the end, the film comes over as a messy delight, thanks to the skill, generosity and good-sport, punching-bag panache of Mr. Grant's performance." [...] About a Boy also marked a notable change in Grant's boyish look. Now 41, he had lost weight and also abandoned his trademark floppy hair. Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman took note of Grant's maturation in his review, saying he looked noticeably older and that it [...] "looked good on him." [...] He added that Grant's [...] "pillowy cheeks are flatter and a bit drawn, and the eyes that used to peer with 'love me' cuteness now betray a shark's casual cunning. Everything about him is leaner and spikier (including his hair, which has been shorn and moussed into a Eurochic bed-head mess), but it's not just his surface that's more virile; the nervousness is gone, too. Hugh Grant has grown up, holding on to his lightness and witty cynicism but losing the stuttering sherry-club mannerisms that were once his signature. In doing so, he has blossomed into the rare actor who can play a silver-tongued sleaze with a hidden inner decency." ...|$|E
