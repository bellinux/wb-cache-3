5|$|After {{the first}} two {{large-scale}} battles between the Spanish and Pipil armies resulted in decisive victories for the European invaders, the natives preferred to flee their settlements at their approach rather than face the conquistadors on an open battlefield. A common tactic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> was to concentrate themselves in strongly-defended mountaintop fortresses.|$|E
5|$|The play {{deals with}} {{relations}} between Native Americans {{and the first}} European settlers in America. Scholars have debated whether the piece is progressive in its depiction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> and have commented that the work reflects an emerging American dramatic and musical sensibility. It served to popularize and romanticize the Pocahontas story as an important American myth.|$|E
50|$|Extensive {{agricultural}} clearing {{in parts}} of this region have led to fragmentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>native</b> ecosystems.

30|$|The topological {{consistency}} measures <b>the</b> topological similarity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>native</b> {{and predicted}} secondary structures. Since {{it is difficult}} to find a simple index to clearly distinguish <b>the</b> difference <b>of</b> RNA secondary structures, we divide the topological consistency into three types: identical, similar, and different (Fig.  2). <b>The</b> topology <b>of</b> a predicted secondary structure is considered to be identical to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>native</b> one if <b>the</b> former has the same loops with the latter (Fig.  2 A). In this case, the predicted secondary structures may have a few additional base pairs that do not occur in <b>the</b> <b>native</b> ones or a few <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>native</b> base pairs that do not form. <b>The</b> topology <b>of</b> a predicted secondary structure is considered to be similar to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>native</b> one if <b>the</b> former has the same multi-way junction loops with the latter but different internal and bulge loops (Fig.  2 B). Finally, <b>the</b> topology <b>of</b> a predicted secondary structure is considered to be different from that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>native</b> one if <b>the</b> former has different multi-way junction loops with the latter (Fig.  2 C).|$|R

5|$|A {{year after}} González Dávila's {{discovery}} of the Gulf of Fonesca, various Spanish expeditions set out to conquer the territory of Honduras. These expeditions were launched southwards from Mexico and Guatemala, and northwards from Panama and Nicaragua; their rival captains clashed in Honduras, resulting in attempts at conquest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> being punctuated by battles between competing Spanish forces, and infighting within individual Spanish groups. The various Spanish groups also fielded indigenous auxiliaries to support their efforts.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, King Leopold II started to receive {{criticism}} for his treatment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> in Congo Free State. In the United States, the main outlet of this criticism was the Presbyterian church. In 1891, Sheppard became involved with William Morrison after Lapsley's death. They would report the crimes they saw, and later, {{with the help of}} Roger Casement, would form the Congo Reform Association (CRA), one of the world's first humanitarian organizations.|$|E
5|$|Responding to this attack, militia Colonel Henry Dodge {{gathered}} {{a force of}} twenty-nine mounted volunteers and set out {{in pursuit of the}} attackers. On June 16, Dodge and his men cornered about eleven of the raiders at a bend in the Pecatonica River. In a brief battle, the Americans killed and scalped all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Natives.</b> The Battle of Horseshoe Bend (or Battle of Pecatonica) was the first real American victory in the war, and helped restore public confidence in the volunteer militia force.|$|E

There {{are at least}} four such churches: <b>the</b> Association <b>of</b> Sons and Daughters <b>of</b> Ukraine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> Ukrainian National Faith, <b>the</b> Association <b>of</b> Sons and Daughters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> Ukrainian National Faith, the fellowship established by Volodymyr Chornyi centred in Lviv, and the more independent Union <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> Ukrainian Faith. According to <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> Sylenko himself, his doctrine {{is that of a}} solar [...] "absolute monotheism", in which the single God is Dazhbog, that is to say the sky, the Sun, and <b>the</b> self-giving <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world itself.|$|R

5|$|The {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Natives</b> left Plymouth on 29 March (Eyton and Pie Wynyard {{followed a}} week later). They arrived in Melbourne in May, where the team played mostly Victorian Rules football, {{hoping to make}} more money that way. Although the side had employed Jack Lawlor to coach them in Victorian Rules during their tour of the British Isles, the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy for such training. As a result, the Victorian Rules matches were a failure; the players' unfamiliarity with the rules, combined with the fact that most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Natives</b> were rugby forwards (and therefore less suited to the more open Victorian Rules), ensured that they failed to perform well on the field and struggled to attract large crowds. The side played nine Victorian Rules matches in total, including one in New South Wales, but won only three of them, all against relatively weak opposition.|$|E
5|$|There are 9 Bawang Assan Iban longhouses {{which are}} 40 {{minutes away from}} the town of Sibu. The longhouses can be dated back from 18th century {{traditional}} longhouses to present day modern longhouses. Visitors can enjoy traditional rice wine tuak and other delicacies such as sarang semut, kain kebat, and pansuh. These Iban longhouses showcase their lifestyles, customs, traditional dance, and music. Homestays are also available at these longhouses. There are 3 ceramic factories in Sibu. Ceramic designs mainly depicts traditional culture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natives.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bartolomé de las Casas spent 50 {{years of}} his life {{actively}} fighting slavery and the violent colonial abuse of indigenous peoples, especially by trying to convince the Spanish court to adopt a more humane policy of colonization. Unlike the other priests who sought to destroy all of the indigenous peoples native books and writings, he was strictly opposed to this action. Although he failed to save the indigenous peoples of the Western Indies, his efforts resulted in several improvements in the legal status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natives,</b> and in an increased colonial focus on the ethics of colonialism. Las Casas is often seen {{as one of the first}} advocates for universal conception of human dignity (later human rights).|$|E

5|$|By summer 1537, Montejo {{believed}} that Higueras {{had been almost}} completely pacified, with very few casualties amongst either the Spanish or the natives. Gracias a Dios and San Pedro were more secure, and many Indians had returned to their villages, encouraged by Montejo's moderate policies. In reality, only the areas around the Spanish settlements had been thoroughly conquered, and in the remoter areas the vast majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> were still hostile to the Spanish, and determined to resist. In contrast to other provinces, the Spanish were unable to recruit reliable native auxiliaries to assist their conquest.|$|E
5|$|Cortés found {{affairs in}} Trujillo to be {{satisfactory}} since {{the departure of}} Moreno, and sent letters to Santo Domingo {{in an effort to}} obtain their recognition of his jurisdiction over the colony. He dispatched ships to Cuba and Jamaica to bring supplies, including domestic animals and plants for cultivation. Cortés sent his cousin Hernando de Saavedra inland, and he overcame local resistance to bring several well-populated districts under Spanish control. Indigenous leaders travelled from far and wide to pledge allegiance to Cortés, whom they considered to be more fair in his dealings than other Spanish captains. With the application of diplomacy, moderate treatment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natives,</b> and the judicious application of force, Cortés tightened the Spanish grip over Honduras.|$|E
5|$|He {{began his}} {{military}} {{career in the}} artillery of Buenos Aires, during the Spanish–Portuguese War, staying in that unit until {{the signing of the}} First Treaty of San Ildefonso that incorporated the Banda Oriental to the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. With the war concluded, he became a regidor of the Buenos Aires Cabildo. He took the arms again in 1778, during an attack <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natives,</b> and directed the operations at the fort in San Miguel del Monte. As Spain fought the American Revolutionary War, it was feared that Britain may launch a counteroffensive against the Spanish colonies. Azcuénaga led an artillery unit with 4 cannons in 1781, but no British attack took place.|$|E

5|$|However, {{this power}} allowed Leiva {{to perform a}} {{maneuver}} that Castelli had not anticipated. Although he approved the end of Cisneros' rule as viceroy, Leiva formed a Junta with Cisneros as its president; Cisneros would stay in power. The {{other members of the}} Junta would have been two peninsulars, the priest Juan Nepomuceno Solá and the merchant José Santos Inchaurregui, and two criollos, Saavedra and Castelli. The bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> rejected the proposal: they did not accept that Cisneros should remain in power, even under a different title. They were suspicious of the intentions of Saavedra, and believed that with Castelli alone in the Junta, little or nothing could be achieved. Castelli and Saavedra resigned that same day to put pressure on Cisneros and force him to resign, and the Junta never came into power.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, the Spanish missionary Fray Alonso de León {{reported}} that about eighty families in San Mateo Ixtatán {{did not pay}} tribute to the Spanish Crown or attend the Roman Catholic mass. He described the inhabitants as quarrelsome and complained that they had built a pagan shrine in the hills among the ruins of pre-Columbian temples, where they burnt incense and offerings and sacrificed turkeys. He reported that every March they built bonfires around wooden crosses about two leagues from the town and set them on fire. Fray de León informed the colonial authorities that the practices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> were such that they were Christian in name only. Eventually, Fray de León was chased out of San Mateo Ixtatán by the locals.|$|E
5|$|In this context, Castelli and Álzaga plotted to oust Liniers and {{constitute}} a local government Junta, {{similar to those}} of the metropoli. This project was not shared by most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> or by the head of the Regiment of Patricians, Cornelio Saavedra. Manuel Belgrano proposed as an alternative to support the plans of Princess Charlotte, which were supported by Castelli and other criollos. Belgrano, who held monarchist ideas, argued that the Carlotist project would be the most practical means of achieving independence from Spain in the circumstances. On September 20, 1808, Castelli wrote a letter to Charlotte, with the signatures of Antonio Beruti, Hipólito Vieytes, Belgrano, and Nicolás Rodríguez Peña.|$|E

5|$|People {{have lived}} along the Rogue River {{and its tributaries}} for at least 8,500years. European explorers made first contact with Native Americans (Indians) {{toward the end of}} the 18thcentury and began beaver {{trapping}} and other activities in the region. Clashes, sometimes deadly, occurred between the natives and the trappers and later between the natives and European-American miners and settlers. These struggles culminated with the Rogue River Wars of 1855–56 and removal of most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> to reservations outside the basin. After the war, settlers expanded into remote areas of the watershed and established small farms along the river between Grave Creek and the mouth of the Illinois River. They were relatively isolated from the outside world until 1895, when the Post Office Department added mail-boat service along the lower Rogue. As of 2010, the Rogue has one of the two remaining rural mail-boat routes in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The London {{establishment}} that governed the game were {{disturbed by the}} New Zealanders' approach to the game; reports of rough and over-aggressive play by the Natives had steadily increased in frequency since their arrival in Britain. In the north of England, criticism of the visitors' sportsmanship was rarer; the tourists were accepted as playing {{the game in the}} same spirit as their local opponents, which in the north was a more working class sport than in the south. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Natives,</b> including Joe Warbrick, accused the RFU and the English press of hypocrisy, claiming that they were quick to criticise the New Zealanders for rough play, yet tolerant of similar behaviour from their own players.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish conquest had as its {{principal}} aims the physical {{incorporation of the}} indigenous peoples of Chiapas into the Spanish Empire, and their spiritual conversion to Christianity. This involved the dismantling of indigenous power structures, the destruction of pagan temples and idols, the concentration of indigenous populations in centralised settlements that could be more easily controlled and evangelised, the incorporation of these new settlements into the Spanish system of tributes and taxes, {{and the introduction of}} Christian imagery. One side of this involved armed struggle and the imposition of Spanish colonial administration by force; the religious side of this struggle was the generally peaceful conversion of indigenous populations to Christianity. In Chiapas, such evangelisation efforts were generally carried out by the Dominican Order. The Dominicans became involved in the concentration of Indians into new settlements, the construction of churches and convents, and the religious instruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natives.</b>|$|E
