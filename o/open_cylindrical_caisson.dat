40|$|In this paper, the {{influence}} of high-intensity ground motion properties {{on the performance of}} bridge piers founded on <b>cylindrical</b> <b>caissons</b> is investigated. The role of the frequency content and of the significant duration of seismic input is assessed to this purpose through a parametric study in which finite element coupled dynamic analyses are carried out in the time domain and in three-dimensional conditions. Real seismic records, of different frequency contents and significant durations, are scaled to similar values of the Arias intensity and are applied at the bedrock depth in terms of horizontal acceleration time histories. Mechanical soil behaviour is described by an elasto-plastic constitutive model with isotropic hardening. Coupled dynamic analyses are performed in terms of effective stresses assuming undrained conditions. Performance of the soil-caisson-pier system is evaluated through the maximum and permanent values of the horizontal displacements of the deck. The studied caisson foundations are characterized by different slenderness ratios but by the same value of the static safety factor against bearing capacity, in order to evaluate the seismic performance of systems given the same initial conditions.

50|$|The {{diameter}} of a cylindrical bore remains constant along its length. The acoustic behavior {{depends on whether}} the instrument is stopped (closed {{at one end and}} open at the other), or open (at both ends). For an open pipe, the wavelength produced by the first normal mode (the fundamental note) is approximately twice the length of the pipe. The wavelength produced by the second normal mode is half that, that is, the length of the pipe, so its pitch is an octave higher; thus an <b>open</b> <b>cylindrical</b> bore instrument overblows at the octave. This corresponds to the second harmonic, and generally the harmonic spectrum of an <b>open</b> <b>cylindrical</b> bore instrument is strong in both even and odd harmonics. For a stopped pipe, the wavelength produced by the first normal mode is approximately four times the length of the pipe. The wavelength produced by the second normal mode is one third that, i.e. the 4/3 length of the pipe, so its pitch is a twelfth higher; a stopped cylindrical bore instrument overblows at the twelfth. This corresponds to the third harmonic; generally the harmonic spectrum of a stopped cylindrical bore instrument, particularly in its bottom register, is strong in the odd harmonics only.|$|R

50|$|The Sand Island is an {{artificial}} island constructed by placing sand within a closed ring of sheet piles {{driven into the}} bed of the river. Two islands were constructed for each pier (one for each of the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>caissons)</b> with the caissons being 28 ft in diameter at the base. The pier on the sloping mud bank also used this method with rectangular caissons. Hornibrook is quoted as stating:"...as far as I am concerned the idea is an original one....The idea came to me one morning about 3 o'clock. I was so much taken up with it that I {{got out of bed and}} commenced to design a scheme to carry out the piers for the Grey Street Bridge."The use of Sand Islands was highly successful and very accurate, and overcame the problem of requiring the cutting edge to be placed directly on dry ground. The material was dredged out of the centre of the caisson and the cylinder progressively sank; however it was necessary to ensure that the caisson was fixed securely to rock and it was therefore essential to ensure man-access into the cylinder. This was achieved by using an air-lock system, but as the men worked under high pressure they could possibly suffer from the bends and an hospital air-lock was located at the surface for repressurisation if required. The foundations for the bridge were very deep, and the experience gained in the construction of this bridge, and later the Story Bridge, was considered of great value and to be a major achievement.|$|R

However, actual instrument bores approximate a frustum of a cone. The wavelength produced by the first normal mode is approximately twice the length of the cone measured from the vertex. The wavelength produced by the second normal mode is approximately equal to the length of the cone, so its pitch is an octave higher.
