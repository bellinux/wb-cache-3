25|$|Culture is {{definitely}} beyond ethnicity and race. Healthcare professionals {{need to learn}} about the tolerance of other's beliefs and remember that the professional care is about meeting patients' needs even if they do not align with <b>our</b> <b>personal</b> beliefs. Discovering our own beliefs and why we have them (from upbringing or modeling of parents, for example) helps understand what is believed and actions at time when others are cared firwith different beliefs. As a result, it is essential for healthcare professionals to practice cultural competence and recognize the differences as well as cultural sensitivities to provide holistic care for the patients.|$|E

25|$|Greater issues {{arose in}} the 1990’s, when supermodel Kate Moss popularized the stick-thin figure instead. The fashion {{industry}} pushed her image further with the ‘heroin-chic’ look, which dominated the catwalks during that time. This was communicated through waifish appearances, bony structures, thin limbs, and an androgynous figure. Although this extreme period was only short-lived, the 2000’s saw {{the rise of the}} Victoria’s Secret models, who altered beauty norms to include slim but healthy figures, with large breasts and bottoms, flat and visible abs, and prominent thigh gaps. Hence, women started pursuing cosmetic surgery practices; on top of diets and exercise regimes, to attain the perfect appearance. Nevertheless, curves are back in season and positive measures are now being taken to promote a better body image. The emergence of fitness trends, plus-size models, and other better role models in the fashion and media industries are other factors at work too. Contrariwise, the advancement of technologies, and the pressures from the media, has unfortunately triggered an even greater societal importance on the way we look as an indication of <b>our</b> <b>personal</b> value.|$|E

She {{reported}} that {{institutions of higher}} learning are taking a fresh look at religion and spirituality and argued that it provides Adventist Education [...] "with multiple opportunities to showcase what we have been doing so very well for so many years." [...] She introduced her theoretical framework to meet these opportunities, titled the Adventist Advantage. The framework consists of seven main points: meaning and purpose found by a connection with Christ as <b>our</b> <b>personal</b> savior; health, wellness, and a wholesome lifestyle; education, caring about {{the life of the mind}} and lifelong learning; ethics and morals; generous service; diversity; and stewardship of the earth, which is tied to the Sabbath.|$|E

500|$|Paul {{traveled}} to Rome, Georgia and {{appeared at the}} downtown Holiday Inn in November 1987. During the appearance, he railed against the policies of Washington D.C., commenting {{that there was no}} difference between the two major parties, and that both supported [...] "intervention overseas,... in <b>our</b> <b>personal</b> lives... in the marketplace." [...] Paul went on to compare his Libertarian ideology to the mindset of the founding fathers. The next month, vice presidential nominee Andre Marrou {{traveled to}} Texas and discussed the Paul campaign's prospects. He opined that the ticket could possibly win 2 to 12 million votes in the following year's election, and that Paul might win if Jesse Jackson and Pat Robertson were selected as the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees, respectively. He explained that America did not want a preacher as president. Since the chance that either of those candidates would be named as their party's representative seemed unlikely, by this point in the election one of the campaign's priorities was securing a place on the ballot, which they had done in 20 of the 50 states.|$|E
500|$|In December 2015, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals {{struck down}} the {{disparagement}} prohibition in the trademark law in a case (Matal v. Tam) involving a denial of trademark registration to the Asian-American band The Slants. The majority opinion stated, in part, that [...] "hatever <b>our</b> <b>personal</b> feelings about the mark at issue here, or other disparaging marks, the First Amendment forbids government regulators to deny registration because they find speech likely to offend others." [...] On June 19, 2017, the Supreme Court unanimously {{ruled in favor of}} Tam, stating [...] "The disparagement clause violates the First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause. Contrary to the Government’s contention, trademarks are private, not government speech." [...] On June 29, 2017, both the Native American petitioners and the Justice Department withdrew from any further litigation now that the Supreme Court has rendered the legal issue moot. While team owner Daniel Snyder expresses the opinion that the court decision is a victory for the team, the Executive Director of the NCAI asserts that the name remains a slur, and the decision that grants it First Amendment protection does not alter any of the arguments against its continued use.|$|E

500|$|On May 10, Giuliani held what The New York Times {{described}} as an [...] "extraordinary, emotional news conference" [...] in Bryant Park to announce that he was seeking a separation from Hanover, saying, [...] "This is very, very painful. For quite some time it's probably been apparent that Donna and I lead in many ways independent and separate lives." [...] Regarding Nathan, Giuliani said [...] "I'm going to need her now more than maybe I did before", making reference to his battle with cancer and her background in nursing. Regarding the senate race, he again did not commit to a decision, saying, [...] "I don't really care about politics right now. [...] I'm thinking about my family, the people that I love {{and what can be}} done that's honest and truthful and that protects them the best. [...] I'm not thinking about politics. Politics comes at least second, maybe third, maybe fourth, somewhere else. It'll all work itself out some way politically." [...] Giuliani had, however, neglected to inform Hanover in advance of his announcement; her reaction was {{described as}} distraught. [...] Three hours later, she held her own news conference at Gracie Mansion, where she said, [...] "Today's turn of events brings me great sadness. I had hoped to keep this marriage together. For several years, it was difficult to participate in Rudy's public life because of his relationship with one staff member." [...] In this, she was making reference to Cristyne Lategano, the former communications director for Giuliani; Vanity Fair had reported in 1997 that Lategano and Giuliani were having an affair, which both of them had denied. [...] Hanover continued, [...] "Beginning last May, I made a major effort to bring us back together. Rudy and I re-established some of <b>our</b> <b>personal</b> intimacy through the fall. At that point, he chose another path." ...|$|E
