5|$|After {{his service}} in the Senate, Rowan {{returned}} to Kentucky, dividing his time between Louisville and Bardstown. During an epidemic <b>of</b> <b>cholera</b> that spread through Bardstown in 1833, three of Rowan's children (William, Atkinson, and Mary Jane) died. The spouses of William and Mary Jane also died <b>of</b> <b>cholera,</b> as did Mary Jane's daughter, and Rowan's sister Elizabeth and her husband. Aid from Bishop Joseph Flaget {{and a group of}} nuns who traveled to Federal Hill during the epidemic probably spared the life of Rowan's orphaned granddaughter, Eliza Rowan Harney.|$|E

40|$|The mutL and mutS genes <b>of</b> Vibrio <b>cholerae</b> {{have been}} {{identified}} using interspecific complementation of Escherichia coli mutL and mutS mutants with plasmids containing the gene bank <b>of</b> V. <b>cholerae.</b> The recombinant plasmid pJT 470, containing a 4. 7 kb fragment <b>of</b> V. <b>cholerae</b> DNA codes for a protein of molecular weight 92, 000.

40|$|The {{structural}} gene xds for extracellular DNase <b>of</b> Vibrio <b>cholerae</b> was cloned and inactivated by insertion of the transposon Tn 5. The inactivated gene was {{introduced into the}} chromosome <b>of</b> V. <b>cholerae</b> by recombination to construct an extracellular DNase-negative strain.

He was educated at Bedford School and took the Sandhurst entrance examination against the wishes of his tutors, entering the college and graduating 35th from his class of 120. In 1894, Lipsett was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Royal Irish Regiment, and took ship to India where he served {{for the next five}} years on the Northwest Frontier, participating in the Tirah Campaign against the Afridi.

40|$|Pili <b>of</b> Vibrio <b>cholerae</b> non-O 1 strain S 7 were {{purified}} and characterized. The pili of S 7 were morphologically, electrophoretically, and immunologically (as far as {{polyclonal antibody}} was used) {{indistinguishable from the}} 16 -kilodalton pili <b>of</b> V. <b>cholerae</b> O 1 strain 82 P 7. The purified pili and organisms had D-mannose- and L-fucose-resistant hemagglutinin. The hemagglutinating activity of the purified pili was inhibited by the Fab fraction of antipilus antibody, but the hemagglutinating activity of live organisms was not inhibited completely. The purified pili or Fab fraction of antipilus antibody did not inhibit the adhesion <b>of</b> V. <b>cholerae</b> non-O 1 to rabbit intestines. Therefore, the pili were not regarded as a colonization factor <b>of</b> V. <b>cholerae</b> non-O 1. A total <b>of</b> 148 V. <b>cholerae</b> non-O 1 and O 1 clinical isolates were screened {{for the presence of}} S 7 pili by using an agglutination test with anti-S 7 pilus serum; 12 <b>of</b> 49 V. <b>cholerae</b> non-O 1 strains and 25 <b>of</b> 99 V. <b>cholerae</b> O 1 strains were positive for agglutination.

40|$|Background: Cholera is {{an acute}} diarrhoeal disease that can cause severe {{dehydration}} and death within the hours of its onset. Considering {{the importance of the}} disease, this study was carried out to assess the antibiotic resistance pattern <b>of</b> Vibrio <b>cholerae</b> (V. cholerae) strains isolated from the stool <b>of</b> <b>cholerae</b> patients in Kashan during 1998 - 2009. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out on stool specimens obtained from acute diarrhea cases referred to health care centers in Kashan. The samples were identified according to the guidelines established by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) and then the biotype and serotype <b>of</b> V. <b>cholerae</b> isolates were identified using the enzymatic method. Finally, antibiotic sensitivity testing was performed using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method.

40|$|Laboratory microecosystems (microcosms) {{prepared}} with a chemically defined sea salt solution {{were used to}} study effects of selected environmental parameters on growth and activity <b>of</b> Vibrio <b>cholerae.</b> Growth responses under simulated estuarine conditions of 10 strains <b>of</b> V. <b>cholerae,</b> including clinical and environmental isolates as well as serovars O 1 and non-O 1, were compared, and all strains yielded populations of approximately the same final size. Effects of salinity and temperature on extended survival <b>of</b> V. <b>cholerae</b> demonstrated that, at an estuarine salinity (25 %) and a temperature of 10 degrees C, V. cholerae survived (i. e., was culturable) for less than 4 days. Salinity was also found to influence activity, as measured by uptake of 14 C-amino acids. Studies {{on the effect of}} selected ions on growth and activity <b>of</b> V. <b>cholerae</b> demonstrated that Na+ was required for growth.

5|$|García Márquez {{started as}} a journalist, and wrote many {{acclaimed}} non-fiction works and short stories, but {{is best known for}} his novels, such as One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967), The Autumn of the Patriarch (1975), and Love in the Time <b>of</b> <b>Cholera</b> (1985). His works have achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success, most notably for popularizing a literary style known as magic realism, which uses magical elements and events in otherwise ordinary and realistic situations. Some of his works are set in the fictional village of Macondo (mainly inspired by his birthplace, Aracataca), and most of them explore the theme of solitude.|$|E
40|$|The El Tor biotype <b>of</b> Vibrio <b>cholerae</b> {{has several}} {{characteristics}} that differentiate {{it from the}} classical biotype <b>of</b> V. <b>cholerae.</b> Among these are production of soluble hemolysin(s), a cell-associated hemagglutinin for chicken erythrocytes, resistance to polymyxin B, and resistance to bacteriophages of Mukerjee group IV. In the present study, we located the determinants for hemolysin (hly), chicken erythrocyte hemagglutinin (cha), and polymyxin B resistance (pmx) on the genetic map <b>of</b> V. <b>cholerae.</b> Transposon-facilitated recombination was used to perform conjugal matings between El Tor donor strains and classical recipient strains <b>of</b> V. <b>cholerae.</b> Recombinants were selected that had inherited specific nutritional markers from the donor strains and streptomycin resistance from the recipient strains.

5|$|In both Mozambique and Malawi, Delfina dropped heavy {{rainfall}} that caused flooding. In the former country, over 18,000houses were severely damaged or destroyed, leaving thousands homeless. The storm damaged roads and bridges, which disrupted relief {{efforts in the}} aftermath, and floods destroyed widespread areas of crops {{in the midst of}} an ongoing food shortage. Lingering flooding caused an outbreak <b>of</b> <b>cholera</b> and malaria in Mozambique, and 47people were killed by Delfina. In Malawi, flooding was not widespread, although the storm destroyed about 3,600houses and killed eight people. Only two months after the storm struck, however, Cyclone Japhet left damage and deaths in many of the same areas that Delfina affected.|$|E
5|$|The Great Stink was {{an event}} in central London in July and August 1858 during which the hot weather {{exacerbated}} the smell of untreated human waste and industrial effluent that was present {{on the banks of}} the River Thames. The problem had been mounting for some years, with an ageing and inadequate sewer system that emptied directly into the Thames. The miasma from the effluent was thought to transmit contagious diseases, and three outbreaks <b>of</b> <b>cholera</b> prior to the Great Stink were blamed on the ongoing problems with the river.|$|E
