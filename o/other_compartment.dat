25|$|McChicken LT (McDonald's Chicken Lettuce and Tomato) was {{the chicken}} {{version of the}} McDLT {{featuring}} the same two-sided container as the McDLT except the packaging was yellow instead of white. It was introduced {{about the same time}} as the McDLT in the mid-1980s. The chicken was a grilled, unbreaded chicken breast placed on the heel of the bun in one of the compartments. The toppings were shredded lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise assembled on the top half of the bun in the <b>other</b> <b>compartment.</b> Cheese was an optional addition for an extra US$0.10. The grilled chicken breast was then basted with a brushing of melted butter. As with the McDLT, the consumer would finalize preparation of the sandwich by combining the hot and cool sides just prior to eating. The McChicken LT was discontinued in the Fall of 1987.|$|E
500|$|It is a {{rectangular}} enclosure some [...] north to south, and [...] east to west, {{surrounded by a}} [...] high wall. The north wall {{is part of the}} castle courtyard, but the remaining three are intricately decorated. The walls are divided by pilasters (now removed) into regular sections, or compartments, each [...] across. Each compartment has a niche above, possibly once containing statues. Those on the east wall have semi-circular pediments carved with scrolls, and with the national symbols of thistle, fleur-de-lis, shamrock and rose, recalling the Union of the Crowns of England and Scotland, under James VI in 1603. The pediments on the south wall are square, while there are no niches on the west wall, indicating that work may have prematurely come to a halt on Sir David's death. Below the niches, the compartments are of alternating design. Three sets of seven carved panels occupy every <b>other</b> <b>compartment.</b> Between them, the walls are decorated with a representation of the Lindsay coat of arms, with eleven recesses {{in the form of a}} fess chequy, or chequered band, surmounted by three seven-pointed stars, taken from the Stirling of Glenesk arms. Several spaces within the walls, including inside the stars, may have been intended as nesting holes for birds.|$|E

60|$|This tells us, {{as to the}} xy-Square, that ONE of its {{compartments}} is 'empty'. But {{this information}} is quite useless, {{as there is no}} mark in the <b>OTHER</b> <b>compartment.</b> If the <b>other</b> <b>compartment</b> happened to be 'empty' too, the Square would be 'empty': and, if it happened to be 'occupied', the Square would be 'occupied'. So, as we do not know WHICH is the case, we can say nothing about THIS Square.|$|E
6000|$|The lifted cover {{revealed}} two compartments {{within the}} box. [...] In {{one was a}} mechanism which resembled the works of a small clock. There also was a little battery of two dry cells. A wire ran from the clockwork {{to one of the}} poles of the battery, and from the other pole through the partition into the <b>other</b> <b>compartment,</b> a second wire returning directly to the clockwork.|$|E
60|$|Not {{the least}} {{attraction}} to many was the gypsy tent erected {{at the edge}} of a thick shrubbery, for it soon became rumored that the old gypsy woman there was no ordinary impostor, but really possessed of extraordinary powers of palmistry. Everything had been done to add to the air of mystery pervading the place. Externally it was but a long, narrow marquee. On entering, the inquirer was shown by an attendant to a seat in an apartment carpeted in red, with black hangings and black cloth lining the roof. From this hung a lamp, all other light being excluded. As each visitor came out from the inner apartment the next in order was shown in, and the heavy curtains shut off all sound of what was passing. Here sat an apparently aged gypsy on an old stump of a tree. A fire burned on the ground and a pot was suspended by a tripod over it; a hood above this carried the smoke out of the tent. The curtains here were red; the roof, as in the <b>other</b> <b>compartment,</b> black, but sprinkled with gold and silver stars. A stool was placed for the visitor close enough to the gypsy for the latter to examine her hand by the light of two torches, which were fastened to a rough sapling stuck in the ground.|$|E

50|$|One {{disadvantage}} of voice pipes {{is that they}} may breach the integrity of watertight spaces.

6000|$|The {{communication}} between the ducal palace and the prisons of Venice is by a gloomy bridge, or covered gallery, high above the water, and divided by a stone wall into a passage and a cell. The state dungeons called pozzi, or wells, were sunk in the thick walls of the palace: and the prisoner, when taken out to die, was conducted across the gallery to the other side, and being then led back into the <b>other</b> <b>compartment,</b> or cell, upon the bridge, was there strangled. The low portal through which the criminal was taken into this cell is now walled up; but the passage is still open, and is still known {{by the name of}} the [...] "Bridge of Sighs." [...] The pozzi are under the flooring of the chamber {{at the foot of the}} bridge. They were formerly twelve; but on the first arrival of the French, the Venetians hastily blocked or broke up the deeper of these dungeons. You may still, however descend by a trap-door, and crawl down through holes, half choked by rubbish, to the depth of two stories below the first range. If you are in want of consolation for the extinction of patrician power, perhaps you may find it there; scarcely a ray of light glimmers into the narrow gallery which leads to the cells, and the places of confinement themselves are totally dark. A small hole in the wall admitted the damp air of the passages, and served for the introduction of the prisoner's food. A wooden pallet, raised a foot from the ground, was the only furniture. The conductors tell you that a light was not allowed. The cells are about five paces in length, two and a half in width, and seven feet in height. They are directly beneath one another, and respiration is somewhat difficult in the lower holes. Only one prisoner was found when the republicans descended into these hideous recesses, and he is said to have been confined sixteen years. But the inmates of the dungeons beneath had left traces of their repentance, or of their despair, which are still visible, and may, perhaps, owe something to recent ingenuity. Some of the detained appear to have offended against, and others to have belonged to, the sacred body, not only from their signatures, but from the churches and belfries which they have scratched upon the walls. The reader may not object to see a specimen of the records prompted by so terrific a solitude. As nearly as they could be copied by more than one pencil, three of them are as follows:-- ...|$|E
50|$|The {{heart of}} the system is several (usually eight) {{powerful}} hydraulic pumps, each capable of producing around 500 horsepower (373 kW). Hydraulic fluid is pumped into several different hydraulic accumulators (energy storing devices) containing two compartments separated by a piston. As the incompressible hydraulic fluid is pumped into one compartment a gas in the <b>other</b> <b>compartment</b> is compressed.|$|E
50|$|In {{electrical}} equipment in hazardous areas, if two electrical enclosures are {{connected by a}} conduit, an explosion of a gas {{in one of the}} compartments travels through the conduit into the next enclosure. The pressure of the 'primary' explosion together with the pressure from the 'secondary' explosion in the <b>other</b> <b>compartment</b> produces one huge explosion that the equipment cannot handle. Heat, arcs or sparks escape from the equipment and ignite any gas or vapour that may be around.|$|E
5000|$|Katanin {{is known}} to be {{abundant}} in the nervous system and even modest levels of it can cause significant microtubule depletion. But microtubules need to be severed throughout <b>other</b> <b>compartments</b> of the neuron so that sufficient numbers of microtubules can undergo rapid transport.|$|R
50|$|Data for <b>other</b> <b>compartments</b> in {{the cell}} are limited, although, in the {{mitochondrion}} the concentration of NAD {{is similar to that}} in the cytosol. This NAD is carried into the mitochondrion by a specific membrane transport protein, since the coenzyme cannot diffuse across membranes.|$|R
50|$|The {{proteins}} that are degraded through CMA are cytosolic proteins or proteins from <b>other</b> <b>compartments</b> once {{they reach the}} cytosol.

5000|$|The striosomes (also {{referred}} to as the striatal patches) are one of two complementary chemical compartments within the striatum (the <b>other</b> <b>compartment</b> is known as the matrix) that can be visualized by staining for immunocytochemical markers such as acetylcholinesterase, enkephalin, substance P, limbic system-associated membrane protein (LAMP), AMPA receptor subunit 1 (GluR1), dopamine receptor subunits, and calcium binding proteins. [...] Striosomal abnormalities have been associated with neurological disorders, such as mood dysfunction in Huntington's disease, though their precise function remains unknown. Striosomes were discovered by Ann Graybiel in 1978 using acetylcholinesterase histochemistry.|$|E

In order to transport restricted or prohibited firearms, an individual must obtain an authorization to transport. An ATT is generally approved only for individuals to transport a restricted or prohibited firearm to a shooting range for target practice, gun show for sale, to a gunsmith or gun shop or for a competition (e.g.: IPSC).|$|E

50|$|The {{premise is}} based on the fictional legend of the pirate captain Henry Steel and the Treasure of Zanzibar.Based on this tale, Steel divided his loot into 14 parts and hid them across the island of Dominica. A special chest, the Chest of Zanzibar, was created with 15 locked compartments, each {{containing}} maps and clues to find each of these stashes. The treasure found through the clues in one compartment will contain a key {{that can be used to}} open another compartment. The 15th compartment, which can only be opened once each <b>other</b> <b>compartment</b> has been opened in order, contains a map showing the location of every gold stash on the island of Dominica and would lead to the largest prize.|$|E
50|$|This design, {{where no}} air passes {{between the two}} compartments, {{provides}} for more appropriate humidity levels and much tighter temperature control in each compartment. It also requires much less energy to operate, since each compressor & coolant system can be optimized for a specific temperature range. Further, opening the door of one compartment {{does not affect the}} temperature of the air or humidity level in the <b>other</b> <b>compartment.</b> Thus, it avoids many of the disadvantages of the much more common single compressor designs described above, although at a higher initial cost and increased system noise. Manufacturers of such designs argue that the increased cost is compensated over time due to reduced energy use and less food waste due to reduced spoilage.|$|E

BIOS-3 consists of a 315 m3 underground steel structure suitable {{for up to three}} persons, and was initially used for developing closed ecosystems capable of supporting humans. It was divided into 4 compartments [...] - [...] one of which is a crew area. The crew area consists of 3 single-cabins, a galley, lavatory and control room. Initially one <b>other</b> <b>compartment</b> was an algal cultivator, and the other two 'phytrons' for growing wheat or vegetables. The plants growing in the two 'phytrons' contributed approximately 25% of the air filtering in the compound. Later the algal cultivator was converted into a third phytron. A level of light comparable to sunlight was supplied in each of the 4 compartments by 20 kW xenon lamps, cooled by water jackets. The facility used 400 kW of electricity, supplied by a nearby hydroelectric power station.|$|E

5000|$|An {{experiment}} {{conducted by}} Solomon and Wynne in 1953 shows {{the properties of}} negative reinforcement. The subjects, dogs, were put in a shuttle box (a chamber containing two rectangular compartments divided by a barrier a few inches high). The dogs {{had the ability to}} move freely between compartments by going over the barrier. Both compartments had a metal floor designed to administer an unpleasant electric shock. Each compartment also had a light above each, which would turn on and off. Every few minutes, the light in the room the dog was occupying was turned off, while the other remained on. If after 10 seconds in the dark, the dog did not move to the lit compartment, a shock was delivered {{to the floor of the}} room the dog was in. The shock continued until the dog moved into the <b>other</b> <b>compartment.</b> In doing this, the dog was escaping the shock by jumping the barrier into the next room. The dog could avoid the shock completely though by jumping the barrier before the 10 seconds of darkness led to a shock. Each trial worked this way with avoiding the shock as the response. In the first few trials, the dog did not move until the shocks began and then it jumped over the barrier. However, after several trials, the dog began to make avoidance responses and would jump over the barrier when the light turned off, and would not receive the shock. Many dogs never received the shock after the first trial. These results led to questioning in the term avoidance paradox (the question of how the nonoccurrance of an aversive event can be a reinforcer for an avoidance response?) ...|$|E
5000|$|From {{his will}} {{it appears that}} the {{surviving}} fine double monument, known as the [...] "Mede Chantry (chapel)", at the east end of the North aisle of the choir of St. Mary Redcliffe Church, was erected on his order. The monument comprises a beautiful heavily canopied double altar-tomb standing against the north wall of which the westernmost contains the recumbent effigies of a man and his wife, their heads resting upon cushions supported by angels. The man is bare-headed, his hair combed back, and is clad in a sleeveless mantle, from which emerge the arms and cuff of an undergown, a scarf hangs from his left shoulders, and a leathern gypciere from his girdle, his feet resting upon a couchant dog. His wife wears a broad fillet across her forehead, her head-dress falling back, a tight-fitting gown with cuffs at the wrists, and a short girdle, her pointed shoes enveloped in the folds of her dress, resting upon two little dogs. On the wall behind the effigies is an heraldic escutcheon displaying the arms of Mede: Gules, a chevron ermine between three trefoils slipped argent, and upon a fillet of brass along its front is an incomplete Latin inscription: ... predicti Thoma(e) Mede, ac ter maioris istius villae Bristolliae, qui ob(ii)t 20 die mensis Decembris Anno D(omi)ni 1475 quoram animabus propicietur Deus, Amen ("... of the foresaid Thomas Mede and thrice Mayor of this town of Bristol, who died on the 20th day of the month of December in the year of our Lord 1475, on the souls of whom may God look upon favourably, Amen"). It is reasonable to suppose that the missing word before [...] "predicti" [...] may have been filius ("son") or frater ("brother"). The <b>other</b> <b>compartment</b> remains empty, but has the monumental brass of his son Richard Mede affixed to the rear wall (see above). Above both compartments is a handsome continuous canopy of rich stone carving, supported by demi-angels bearing open books, and wearing upright caps with hexagonal flowers upon their heads.
