5|$|In 2002 a 700-year-old oak tree, {{called the}} Domesday Oak, was {{selected}} by The Tree Council as one of 50 Great British Trees. In 2011 a crack appeared in the trunk and oak support beams were fitted to support the tree. The supports were only partly successful and a section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> collapsed; the remaining part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> was pruned to reduce {{the weight of the}} surviving section.|$|E

The tree faces several threats, including soil compaction from foot and vehicle traffic due to tourism and special events in the park, drought, and the interruption of irrigation due to courthouse renovation. New restrictions were imposed in 2000 after the health <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> began to decline. common myna birds (Acridotheres tristis) roost in the branches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> at sunset, causing a cacophony of bird cries as the evening approaches.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the story}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tree</b> That Owns Itself is more legend than history, the tree has become (along with the University Arch and the Double-Barreled Cannon) {{one of the}} most {{recognized}} and well-loved symbols of Athens.

5|$|Beetles have {{a variety}} of ways to communicate, {{including}} the use of pheromones. The mountain pine beetle emits a pheromone to attract other beetles to a tree. The mass of beetles are able to overcome the chemical defenses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> After the tree's defenses have been exhausted, the beetles emit an anti-aggregation pheromone. The species can stridulate to communicate.|$|E

5|$|By 1906, erosion {{had become}} {{apparent}} {{at the base}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> George Foster Peabody paid to have new soil, a commemorative tablet, and a chain barricade supported by eight granite posts installed around the tree. Despite these efforts, the tree reportedly suffered heavy damage during an ice storm in 1907. Although attempts were made at preservation, rot had already set in, and the tree was permanently weakened.|$|E
5|$|During this process, fungal spores {{germinate}} in the boreholes, {{a reaction}} {{caused by the}} dryness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree,</b> creating an appropriate environment and an entry for air.

5|$|In mythology, {{birds were}} {{sometimes}} monsters, like the Roc and the Māori's Pouākai, a giant bird capable of snatching humans. In Persian mythology, the simurgh was a gigantic bird, {{the first to}} come into existence, and it nested on the tree of plant life that grew in the great ocean beside the tree of immortality. Its task was to shake the seeds of all the plants out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b>|$|E

5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether the story <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tree</b> That Owns Itself began with the Weekly Banner article, or {{if it had been}} an element of local {{folklore}} prior to that time.

5|$|Protesters {{continued}} {{to delay the}} destruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> Solicitors for the campaign had even argued in court that receipt of a letter addressed to the tree itself gave it {{the status of a}} legal dwelling, causing a further delay,. In the early morning of 7 December 1993, several hundred police arrived to evict the protesters, which took ten hours to carry out. Protesters made numerous complaints against the police; police, in turn, denied these allegations, attributing any misbehaviour to the protesters. Media attention started to increase regarding the protest, with several daily newspapers putting pictures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> on their front pages.|$|E

We study a more general orchard model, namely any domain that is compact and convex, and find an expression for <b>the</b> minimal radius <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees.</b> As an example, rhombus-shaped orchards are treated in some depth. Finally, we give some estimates for <b>the</b> minimal radius <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> if we see the orchard as being 3 -dimensional. ...|$|R

5|$|Six {{victims of}} the {{shooting}} were carried to {{the porch of the}} Brewer house, which was shaded by a tall oak tree. The tree became famously known as the Tragedy Oak.

5|$|The female Eurasian {{treecreeper}} forages {{primarily on}} the upper parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> trunks, while the male uses the lower parts. A study in Finland found that if a male disappears, the unpaired female will forage at lower heights, spend less time on each tree and have shorter foraging bouts than a paired female.|$|E
