40|$|The {{interest}} in flavour stability has strongly {{increased in the}} last years due to its relation with the quality and acceptability of food products. Fixation or encapsulation of flavour compounds protects flavours from loss, migration or oxidation during processing or storage. Class II hydrophobins are interesting microbial biosurfactants with potential for encapsulating hydrophobic molecules in aqueous environments. Their characteristics are based on their ability to form highly ordered monolayers at hydrophilic/hydrophobic interfaces. In this study, the feasibility of Class II hydrophobins as fixation agents were studied in order to extend the presence of hop compounds such as <b>ocimene</b> and myrcene in solution with the purpose of stabilizing volatile flavour compounds. Class II hydrophobins of high purity were produced using Reversed Phase Liquid Chromatography (RP-LC). Identification of hydrophobins was performed by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time Of Flight (MALDI-TOF). As hop compounds, <b>ocimene</b> (assay ≥ 90 %, Sigma-Aldrich) and myrcene (technical grade, Sigma-Aldrich) were investigated. Using Gas Chromatography with Flame Ionization Detection (GC-FID), it was possible to quantify the hop components which remained in solution. By Modified Carlsberg Test (MCT), the quantity of hop compounds that interacted with the hydrophobins, was determined. The droplet size of the complexes formed in liquid samples was measured using Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) (Nano-flex 180 ·, Microtrac, Germany). The quantification of hop compounds was performed at different hours in order to know the rate of evaporation of those compounds in the presence and absence of class II hydrophobins. It was observed that when 0. 12 mg/ml - 1 of pure HFBII was present in an <b>ocimene</b> solution of 0. 04 mg/ml- 1 contained in an open flask, after 3 days, 37. 5 % of the <b>ocimene</b> dispersed was still present in comparison with the samples without HFBII where any <b>ocimene</b> remained. Using Modified Carlsberg Test, the quantity of hop compounds able to interact with the hydrophobic patch of three different types of class II hydrophobins, namely HFBI and HFBII from Trichoderma Reesei and HFB- 2 a 2 from Trichoderma Harzianum was determined, finding that 10 µl/L of <b>ocimene</b> is sufficient to interact with 0. 2 mg/L- 1 of HFBI, HFBII and HFB- 2 a 2 in presence of CO 2. The results clearly demonstrate that the presence of class II hydrophobins in solutions that contain apolar molecules, such as the hop compounds used in this study, promotes the interaction of those compounds with the hydrophobic patch of the proteins, giving as a result new complexes that postpone the release of those volatile molecules to the gas phase.

40|$|Pollinator-mediated {{reproductive}} isolation {{is a major}} factor in driving the diversification of flowering plants. Studies of floral traits involved in {{reproductive isolation}} have focused nearly exclusively on visual signals, such as flower color. The role of less obvious signals, such as floral scent, has been studied only recently. In particular, the genetics of floral volatiles involved in mediating differential pollinator visitation remains unknown. The bumblebee-pollinated Mimulus lewisii and hummingbird-pollinated M. cardinalis are a model system for studying reproductive isolation via pollinator preference. We have shown that these two species differ in three floral terpenoid volatiles - D-limonene, β-myrcene, and E-β-ocimene - that are attractive to bumblebee pollinators. By genetic mapping and in vitro enzyme activity analysis we demonstrate that these interspecific differences are consistent with allelic variation at two loci – LIMONENE-MYRCENE SYNTHASE (LMS) and <b>OCIMENE</b> SYNTHASE (OS). M. lewisii LMS (MlLMS) and OS (MlOS) are expressed most strongly in floral tissue in the last stages of floral development. M. cardinalis LMS (McLMS) is weakly expressed and has a nonsense mutation in exon 3. M. cardinalis OS (McOS) is expressed similarly to MlOS, but the encoded McOS enzyme produces no E-β-ocimene. Recapitulating the M. cardinalis phenotype by reducing the expression of MlLMS by RNAi in transgenic M. lewisii produces no behavioral difference in pollinating bumblebees; however, reducing MlOS expression produces a 6 % decrease in visitation. Allelic variation at the <b>OCIMENE</b> SYNTHASE locus likely contributes to differential pollinator visitation, and thus promotes reproductive isolation between M. lewisii and M. cardinalis. <b>OCIMENE</b> SYNTHASE joins a growing list of “speciation genes” (“barrier genes”) in flowering plants...|$|E

In each of three test days, three potted plants per odour treat-ment were sprayed with each compound, whereas three unsprayed plants were used as a natural control treatment. All the plants were located in the proximity of an apiary with five honey bee colonies. The number of visits by both honey bees and other polli-nating hymenopterans were recorded on each plant between 14. 30 h and 15. 30 h every day, and between 17. 00 h and 17. 30 h on {{the second and third}} days. Every day at 18. 00 h, the 12 plants were placed back under an isolation cage, where five other plants were kept throughout as a control, not pollinated by insects. After about 40 days, number and weight of seeds were recorded on all 41 plants. Chemical analyses on bulked flowers collected from all plants confirmed previous results (high concentrations of trans- 2 -hexenal, relatively large amounts of oct- 1 -en- 3 -ol, and limited amounts of <b>ocimene).</b> The effect of pollinating insects was re-markable on seed set, as indicated by the comparison between the 36 plants used in the outdoor trial and the five plants always kept in the cage.

40|$|Hydrophobins are {{a family}} of low {{molecular}} weight proteins consisting of four disulfide bridges and an extraordinary hydrophobic patch. Under typical condition, the latter can interact with gaseous CO 2 resulting {{in the formation of}} the stable CO 2  nanobubbles covered by an elastic membrane in carbonated beverages, providing the required energy for ocurring primary gushing. Hydrophobins include exceptional surface active properties with potential applications in several scientific and technological fields. A number of applications for Class II hydrophobins have been proposed to use it as biosurfactant and where high grade purity is needed, like where studying the compatibility between gaseous CO 2 and other hydrophobic molecules for interaction with the hydrophobins, as it is necessary for the flavor and beverages industry. Therefore, it becomes necessary to develop a large scale procedure for their production and purification. A protocol to produce Class II hydrophobin HFBII, a protein with a molecular weight (MW) of  7. 2 kDa consisting of 71  amino acids, from Trichoderma reesei (T. reesei) through fermentation process was established. After that, the procedure of purification via chromatography was carried out.  The highly pure HFBII (kappa-grade) was identified by MALDI-TOF. Fundamental understanding of the mechanism of primary gushing was established after obtaining kappa-HFBII and using it for gushing tests. The possible interaction between this molecule and gaseous CO 2 was further investigated. The obtained kappa-HFBII was added to the carbonated water and the standard gushing test was carried out. The CO 2 nanobubbles observed in gushed liquid with critical diameter at atmospheric pressure (i. e. around 110 - 120 nm) was considered to be an essential pre-condition for providing sufficient energy to provoke the primary gushing. Several operative parameters are involved for production of HFBII by the wild type T.  reesei. The production of HFBII occurred when the major part of lactose was taken up. This observation led to the design of a biofilm reactor, promoting the growth of the fungal biomass in a solid state physiology, and the excretion of hydrophobin. The use of biofilm has led to a significant increase of HFBII production in shorter time by comparison with a classical submerged bioreactor.  Upscaling  the  biofilm  reactor  was  effectively realized to a  10 liter working volume fermenter. X-ray tomography illustrated that the biofilm overgrowth occurred when successive cultures were performed on the same packing. However, this phenomenon did not influence the yield of HFBII, suggesting that the procedure could be operated in continuous mode. After production of HFBII, it is required to extract it from the growth media of T. reesei.  For this, the physico-chemical properties (e. g. amphiphilic nature and high elasticity) of Class II hydrophobins were used by applying a CO 2  foam fractionation system. After foam fractionation, a foamate was obtained which is in fact an aqueous solution enriched by HFBII (namely alpha-HFBII). The enrichment value was calculated to be 4. 6 (based on the volumetric concentration) and 3. 75 (based on the protein content).  The physico-chemical characteristics of alpha-HFBII were also investigated.  The gushing activity of alpha-HFBII after spray-drying was diminished to 31 % of the gushing activity of the sample before spray-drying, suggesting the occurrence of protein rearrangement during the process. It was shown that addition of an auxiliary biosurfactant besides hydrophobin during spray-drying could partially avoid the deactivation of dried alpha-HFBII.  Next step was upscaling the purification using a 30 RPC liquid chromatography. The quality and the quantity of the final obtained kappa-HFBII with this last set-up was comparable to that of the 15 RPC lab-scale column. The retention of a dispersed volatile compound by HFBII in a liquid solution for a prolonged time was studied at the end of this project. For the proof of principle, at first the binding between HFBII and <b>ocimene,</b> a typical monoterpene in hops, was studied. Inhibition of gushing by addition of ocimene to bottles of carbonated water contaminated by kappa-HFBII confirmed the hypothesis. It was proven that ocimene in a liquid solution was emulsified in the presence of HFBII, since new droplets with smaller size were observed to be generated. Besides, the migration of HFBII to the interface of the liquid in the presence of ocimene was postponed. It was concluded that HFBII and <b>ocimene</b> bind together. The retention of <b>ocimene</b> in a solution by addition of HFBII was measured by SPME-GC-MS. The results showed that when HFBII (0. 26 ± 0. 03 mg/mL) was present in a solution of ocimene (5. 9 × 10 - 6 mg/mL), 43 % of the <b>ocimene</b> remained after 3 days. This value was twice as high as for the control sample and indicated that the bond between HFBII and ocimene slowed down the release of ocimene to the gas phase, probably due to the better dispersion of the <b>ocimene</b> in the liquid.  status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Emission of BVOC (Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds) from plant {{leaves in}} {{response}} to ozone exposure (O- 3) and nitrogen (N) fertilization is poorly understood. For the first time, BVOC emissions were explored in a forest tree species (silver birch, Betula pendula) exposed for two years to realistic levels of O- 3 (35, 48 and 69 ppb as daylight average) and N (10, 30 and 70 kg ha(- 1) yr(- 1), applied weekly to the soil as ammonium nitrate). The main BVOCs emitted were: alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, limonene, <b>ocimene,</b> (E) - 4, 8 -dimethyl- 1, 3, 7 -nonatriene (DMNT) and hexanal. Ozone exposure increased BVOC emission and reduced total leaf area. The effect on emission was stronger when a short-term O- 3 metric (concentrations {{at the time of}} sampling) rather than a long-term one (AOT 40) was used. The effect of O- 3 on total leaf area was not able to compensate for the stimulation of emission, so that responses to O- 3 at leaf and whole plant level were similar. Nitrogen fertilization increased total leaf area, decreased alpha-pinene and beta-pinene emission, and increased <b>ocimene,</b> hexanal and DMNT emission. The increase of leaf area changed the significance of the emission response to N fertilization for most compounds. Nitrogen fertilization mitigated the effects of O- 3 exposure on total leaf area, while the combined effects of O- 3 exposure and N fertilization on BVOC emission were additive and not synergistic. In conclusion, O- 3 exposure and N fertilization have the potential to affect global BVOC via direct effects on plant emission rates and changes in leaf area...|$|E

40|$|The {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} essential oil of the leaves of Teclea nobilis Delile (Rutaceae) (TN), was investigated by using GC/MS. Out of fifty four peaks (representing 99. 3 % of the oil), twenty three components were identified, representing 62. 3 % of the total oil composition. The main components were Germacrene-d (19 %), <b>Ocimene</b> isomer (13 %), Guaiol (3. 9 %), Elemol (2. 9 %) and Bulnesol (2. 5 %). Analgesia was evident in both the acetic acid induced writhing and tail flick reaction time tests in mice. A significant antipyretic activity of oil was also observed in mice. A slow and gradual neuromuscular blocking effect was recorded on rat`s phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparation. The oil showed no anti-microbial potential on various microorganisms tested.

40|$|Reactions of the {{hydroxyl}} radical (OH) {{play a central}} role in the chemistry of the atmosphere, and measurements of its concentration can provide a rigorous test of our understanding of atmospheric oxidation. Several recent studies have shown large discrepancies between measured and modeled OH concentrations in forested areas impacted by emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), where modeled concentrations were significantly lower than measurements. A potential reason for some of these discrepancies involves interferences associated with the measurement of OH using the laser-induced fluorescence–fluorescence assay by gas expansion (LIF-FAGE) technique in these environments. In this study, a turbulent flow reactor operating at atmospheric pressure was coupled to a LIF-FAGE cell and the OH signal produced from the ozonolysis of α -pinene, β -pinene, <b>ocimene,</b> isoprene, and 2 -methyl- 3 -buten- 2 -ol (MBO) was measured. To distinguish between OH produced from the ozonolysis reactions and any OH artifact produced inside the LIF-FAGE cell, an external chemical scrubbing technique was used, allowing for the direct measurement of any interference. An interference under high ozone (between 2  [*]×[*]  10 13 and 10  [*]×[*]  10 13  cm − 3) and BVOC concentrations (between approximately 0. 1  [*]×[*]  10 12 and 40  [*]×[*]  10 12  cm − 3) was observed that was not laser generated and was independent of the ozonolysis reaction time. For the ozonolysis of α - and β -pinene, the observed interference accounted for approximately 40  % of the total OH signal, while for the ozonolysis of <b>ocimene</b> the observed interference accounted for approximately 70  % of the total OH signal. Addition of acetic acid to the reactor eliminated the interference, suggesting that the source of the interference in these experiments involved the decomposition of stabilized Criegee intermediates (SCIs) inside the FAGE detection cell. Extrapolation of these measurements to ambient concentrations suggests that these interferences should be below the detection limit of the instrument...|$|E

Forty-eight and Thirty-nine constituents were identified in hydro-distillation and CombiPAL system which represented 99. 7 % and 99. 8 % of the oils, respectively. hydro-distillation method were α-pinene (30. 8 %), β- pinene (12. 0 %), myrcene (8. 9 %), limonene (7. 9 %), (E) -caryophyllene (5. 6 %), Germacrene D (6. 9 %), Bicyclogermacrene (4. 5 %), α- Eudesmol (2. 0), valerianol (3. 4 %), and 7 -epi-α-Eudesmol (3. 2 %) and the main compounds by CombiPAL techniques were α-pinene (38. 8 %), β- pinene (15. 5 %), myrcene (21. 0 %), limonene (13. 1 %), and trans- β- <b>ocimene</b> (3. 4 %).

40|$|The {{reaction}} between pigments and linaIool, {{which is}} a common component of perfumes, was carried out with a microcatalytic reactor at 178 øC. Most of the linalool was decomposed by these pigments with high catalytic activity, and the decomposition products differed depending {{on the nature of}} the pigment. The decomposition products were identified by mass spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy showing that these products were dehydrated linalool such as myrcene, <b>ocimene,</b> and alloocimene, and cyclized products such as limonene, terpinolene, and alpha-terpinene. Furthermore, p-cymene was produced by those pigments having a high catalytic activity. The following decomposition mechanism is suggested for linalool from the decomposition products: Dehy-drated linalool is formed via a carbonium ion intermediate formed on acidic sites on the pigments, and cyclized products are formed after allyl rearrangement. Finally, p-cymene, {{which is a}} main cause of un-pleasant odor in some pigmented cosmetics, is formed by dehydrogenation of the cyclized products...|$|E
30|$|Sensory {{differences}} between irrigated and drought samples of IR 64 identified an astringent aroma in the drought samples (Table  1). Phenol {{is present in}} IR 64 drought and Apo grains (Table  2), {{and this is a}} compound commonly associated with astringency (Bahar and Altug 2009). Undesirable aromas such as sewer animal and sour/silage were found in Apo alone, often/typically associated with the presence of propene thiol and <b>ocimene</b> (O’Neill and Phillips 1992; Loper et al. 1971), both of which were detected in Apo. Hay-like/musty off-flavour aromas were most strongly detected by the sensory evaluation in drought-affected IR 64 and both samples of Apo. Hexanal and heptanal could explain those aromas (Lam and Proctor 2003). The strong similarity between the sensory data of the samples and the pattern of loadings in Figure  2 B indicates that delving deeper into metabolomics to explain aroma could lead {{to the development of a}} new suite of tools to select for aromatic profiles.|$|E
40|$|The {{reproductive}} organs of some plants self-heat, release scent, and attract pollinators. The relations among these processes {{are not well}} understood, especially in the more ancient, nonflowering gymnosperm lineages. We describe the influence of plant volatiles in an obligate pollination mutualism between an Australian Macrozamia cycad (a gymnosperm with male and female individuals) and its specialist thrips pollinator, Cycadothrips chadwicki. Pollen-laden thrips leave male cycad cones en masse during the daily thermogenic phase, when cone temperatures and volatile emissions increase dramatically and thrips are repelled. As thermogenesis declines, total volatile emissions diminish and cones attract thrips, resulting in pollination of female cones. Behavioral and electrophysiological tests on thrips reveal that variations in b-myrcene and <b>ocimene</b> emissions by male and female cones are sufficient to explain the observed sequential thrips 2 ̆ 7 repellence (push) and attraction (pull). These dynamic interactions represent complex adaptations that enhance the likelihood of pollination and may reflect an intermediate state {{in the evolution of}} biotic pollination...|$|E
40|$|The {{selection}} of proper compounds {{to include in}} perfumesâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 formulation {{is of particular interest}} for the perfume industry.
