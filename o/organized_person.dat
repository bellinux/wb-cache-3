40|$|There is a saying, “When {{you want}} {{something}} done, give the task to a busy person. ” A busy schedule and a goal-oriented mentality require good organizational skills. Being an <b>organized</b> <b>person</b> entails “wasting ” less time between tasks, on useless tasks, on off-task behavior, or on ineffec-tive approaches. There are 2 essential paradigms for multitasking: doing multiple activities simulta-neously (this works well when the activities are in nonconflicting domains, such as jogging while lis-tening to a book on tape), and switching back and forth among activities (which {{is what happens when}} one engages in multiple same-domain activi-ties, such as composing an e-mail while listening to a lecture) ...|$|E

This thesis is no exception and, despite having a single author listed, it {{is the work of}} many people spread over many years who all deserve recognition. First and foremost I would thank my advisers, Professors Satish Kumar and Marcio Carvalho, for their constant support and guidance. Through them I not only learned how to do research, but how to be a more patient, <b>organized</b> <b>person</b> (which was sorely needed!). I would have struggled endlessly without them. I {{would like to thank the}} late Prof. Skip Scriven for introducing me to the field of fluid mechanics and for whipping me into shape as a graduate student, even though this process was at times quite painful. I am truly fortunate to have had Skip as a teacher and a mentor, and I wish I had known him better. I would like to thank Prof. Lorraine Francis for teaching me what I know about coating and drying, and for helping to keep me focused on practical problems instead of theoretical abstractions. I would like to thank Prof. Victor Barocas for always having an open door, and for helping to guide me through my graduate career. Dr. Andrew Yeckel, Dr. Jaewook Nam and Dr. Kristianto Tjiptowidjojo taught me what little I know about the finite element method, and I thank them for their patience in guiding me through such a confusing maze. Wieslaw Suszynki was essential for all experimental work, and for making sure I didn’t break anything. I tell incoming graduate students that the most important decision they will make is not so much their future adviser, but their future group. I don’t think I could have chosen better people to have buying me coffee, and I would like to thank Dr. Scott Roberts, Dr...|$|E

And that man a thief, flying from the employers whom he had cheated! I pushed open the heavy oaken street-door, fearing that this might be the true explanation of the change which I had already remarked in her. My apprehensions were confirmed when she unlocked the inner door, leading from the courtyard to the sitting-room, and let me in.|$|R

40|$|WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF THE TERMS {{international}} and globalization? How have they evolved, {{and what is}} their relevance? These are the questions Christopher N. Warren attempts to answer in Literature 2 ̆ 6 the Law of Nations. Warren explores how the modern concept of law of nations has evolved and developed, tracing how it has passed from one age, culture, or language to the next. Warren argues the law of nations has evolved through literature, and that the recurrence of key words {{can be used to}} explore its roots. By examining literary works through the ages, the historical meaning of “nation” can be assessed and explained. Using works by Milton, Hobbes, Shakespeare, Grotius, and others, Warren demonstrates how genres (epic, tragicomedy, history, biblical tragedy) <b>organized</b> <b>persons,</b> actions, events, and evidence into recognizable, modern legal categories. Over seven chapters, Warren analyzes the relationship between literature produced in the 16 th and 17 th centuries and the development of national and international concepts in law. The first chapter establishes a broad rationale for a literary history of international law. Warren dissects the meaning of international, acknowledging the historic importance of the plurality of nations to explore its challenges and possibilities, so that readers can better understand the “early modern nexus of law and literature. ”...|$|R

40|$|Following the {{enactment}} of the NLRA in 1935, American Federation of Labor craft unions had difficulty <b>organizing</b> <b>persons</b> employed in manufacturing industries since most failed to fit within the jurisdictions of particular unions. The AFL formed the Committee for Industrial Organization to determine how best to organize these workers, and this Committee ultimately withdrew from the AFL and formed the Congress of Industrial Organizations. The CIO unions quickly organized the industrial workers in the steel, automobile, electrical manufacturing, and rubber industries. By the late 1950 s, 35 percent of private sector employees were union members. As the United States economy began to transition from manufacturing to post-industrial white collar and service, union membership began a steady decline. By 2005, it was under 8 percent. Unions continue to employ blue collar appeals to organize new-age, twenty-first century employees. If labor organizations are to regain their previous vitality, they need to form new entities that will appeal to white-collar workers in retail, insurance, finance, health care, and similar occupations. The Change-to-Win Coalition recently broke away from the AFL-CIO with the goal of spending more money to organize modern workers. These entities need to create new professional associations that will appeal to new-age workers who view traditional union membership as unprofessional. They need to reflect the hopes and aspirations of the people they are endeavoring to organize. If labor organizations fail to adjust, they will become almost irrelevant institutions...|$|R
