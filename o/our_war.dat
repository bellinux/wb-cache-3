[...] Of the story and characters Galbraith wrote that [...] "scenes such as the large family coming together and talking over dinner are heartwarming and hilarious." [...] and {{compared the}} movie to [...] "a moving picture book, a family photo album turned back a few decades." [...] He also noted the audience response, reporting sold-out screenings two nights in a row, and highlighting handwritten notes left at the theater by [...] "hoardes of fans who on the spot {{decided to move to}} Nagano" [...] In conclusion, Galbraith wrote [...] "there is an innocence and purity to this work that really reminds [...] of Miyazaki Hayao and Studio Ghibli back in the day, and the stellar backgrounds invoke Shinkai Makoto." [...] Justin Sevakis of Anime News Network gave the film an 'A' rating and wrote that [...] "decades from now, Summer Wars will be seen as the official arrival of [...] Mamoru Hosoda into the realm of historically important anime directors." [...] He called the film [...] "a near-perfect blend of social satire and science fiction, at once timely and timeless, sardonic and optimistic." [...] and noted that the film is [...] "practically overflowing with sharp social insight in a way we have not seen from anime in years." [...] Sevakis praised Yoshiyuki Sadamoto's character designs and highlighted the visuals as [...] "sharp and consistently great". In summing the film up he called Summer Wars [...] "Incredibly entertaining, and intriguingly intelligent. Accessible and fast-paced. Pretty much perfect." [...] Similarities have been commented on between the film and a previous work of Hosoda, [...] Neo magazine has stated that <b>Our</b> <b>War</b> Game is [...] "plainly a prototype" [...] of Summer Wars.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the liberation}} war, freedom fight became a unique subject. The first of this {{discipline}} is Anwar Pasha's Rifle Roti Awrat {{that he wrote}} during the war. Shaukat Osman's Jahannam Hoite Bidai, Nekre Aranyo, Dui Soinik, Rashid Haider's Khanchai, Andho Kothamala, Shawkat Ali's Jatraa, Selina Hossain's Hangor Nodi Granade, Mahmudul Huq's Jiban Aamar Bone, Syed Shamsul Haq's Nil Dangshon, Nishiddho Loban, Harun Habib's Priyo Joddha Priyotoma, Humayun Ahmed's Jochona O Jononir Golpo etc. are examples of novels which directly deal freedom fight as their subject. Besides this, novels like Amar Jato Glani by Rashid Karim, Ferari Surjo by Rabeya Khatun, Abelay Ashamoy by Amjad Hossain also portray the different facets of liberation war. Rashid Karim's Prem Ekti Lal Golap, Ekaler Rupkotha or Sadharon Loker Kahini are presentation of the hopeless picture of Bangladesh after the war.

Thomas Dugdale also claimed Baldwin said to him: [...] "If we do have a war, Winston must be Prime Minister. If he is in [...] now we shan't be able to engage in that war as a united nation". The General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Walter Citrine, recalled a conversation he had had with Baldwin on 5 April 1943: [...] "Baldwin thought his [...] political recovery was marvellous.
