25|$|Bone {{volume is}} {{determined}} by the rates of bone formation and bone resorption. Recent research has suggested that certain growth factors may work to locally alter bone formation by increasing <b>osteoblast</b> activity. Numerous bone-derived growth factors have been isolated and classified via bone cultures. These factors include insulin-like growth factors I and II, transforming growth factor-beta, fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and bone morphogenetic proteins. Evidence suggests that bone cells produce growth factors for extracellular storage in the bone matrix. The release of these growth factors from the bone matrix could cause the proliferation of <b>osteoblast</b> precursors. Essentially, bone growth factors may act as potential determinants of local bone formation.

40|$|International {{audience}} PURPOSE: Clinical and {{in vitro}} studies suggest that subchondral bone sclerosis due to abnormal <b>osteoblasts</b> {{is involved in the}} progression of osteoarthritis (OA). Human <b>osteoblasts</b> isolated from sclerotic subchondral OA bone tissue show an altered phenotype, a decreased canonical Wnt/ß-catenin pathway, and a reduced mineralization in vitro as well as in vivo. These alterations were linked with an abnormal response to BMP- 2. OA <b>osteoblasts</b> release factors such as the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) that contribute to cartilage loss whereas chondrocytes do not express HGF. HGF can stimulate BMP- 2 expression in human <b>osteoblasts,</b> however, the role of HGF and its effect in OA <b>osteoblasts</b> remains unknown. Here we investigated whether elevated endogenous HGF levels in OA <b>osteoblasts</b> are responsible for their altered response to BMP- 2. METHODS: We prepared primary human subchondral <b>osteoblasts</b> using the sclerotic medial portion of the tibial plateaus of OA patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty, or from tibial plateaus of normal individuals obtained at autopsy. The expression of HGF was evaluated by qRT-PCR and the protein production by western blot analysis. HGF expression was reduced with siRNA technique whereas its activity was inhibited using the selective inhibitor PHA 665752. Alkaline phosphatase activity (ALPase) and osteocalcin release were measured by substrate hydrolysis and EIA respectively. Canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling (cWnt) was evaluated both by target gene expression using the TOPflash TCF/lef luciferase reporter assay and western blot analysis of β-catenin levels in response to Wnt 3 a stimulation. Mineralization in response to BMP- 2 was evaluated by alizarin red staining. RESULTS: The expression of HGF was increased in OA <b>osteoblasts</b> compared to normal <b>osteoblasts</b> and was maintained during their in vitro differentiation. OA <b>osteoblasts</b> released more HGF than normal <b>osteoblasts</b> as assessed by western blot analysis. HGF stimulated the expression of TGF-β 1. BMP- 2 dose-dependently (1 to 100 ng/ml) stimulated both ALPase and osteocalcin in normal <b>osteoblasts</b> whereas, it inhibited them in OA <b>osteoblasts.</b> HGF-siRNA treatments reversed this response in OA <b>osteoblasts</b> and restored the BMP- 2 response. cWnt is reduced in OA <b>osteoblasts</b> compared to normal, and HGF-siRNA treatments increased cWnt in OA <b>osteoblasts</b> almost to normal. Smad 1 / 5 / 8 phosphorylation in response to BMP- 2, which is reduced in OA <b>osteoblasts,</b> was corrected when these cells were treated with PHA 665752. The BMP- 2 -dependent mineralization of OA <b>osteoblasts,</b> which is also reduced compared to normal, was only partially restored by PHA 665752 treatment whereas 28 days treatment with HGF reduced the mineralization of normal <b>osteoblasts.</b> CONCLUSION: OA <b>osteoblasts</b> expressed more HGF than normal <b>osteoblasts.</b> Increased endogenous HGF production in OA <b>osteoblasts</b> stimulated the expression of TGF-β 1 and reduced their response to BMP- 2. Inhibiting HGF expression or HGF signaling restored the response to BMP- 2 and Smad 1 / 5 / 8 signaling. In addition, decreased HGF signaling partly corrects the abnormal mineralization of OA <b>osteoblasts</b> while increased HGF prevents the normal mineralization of normal <b>osteoblasts.</b> In summary, we hypothesize that sustained elevated HGF levels in OA <b>osteoblasts</b> drive their abnormal phenotype and is implicated in OA pathophysiology. </p...|$|R

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been introduced as basic tools for bone tissue generation. Through MSCs, adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are more interesting. Since the similarity of native <b>osteoblasts</b> and differentiated <b>osteoblasts</b> from ADSCs in terms of gene expression pattern is unknown, {{this study was designed to}} compare gene expression patterns of some genes involved in osteogenesis between human native <b>osteoblasts</b> and adipose-derived differentiated <b>osteoblasts.</b> Materials and Methods: Realtime qRT-PCR was used for studying the gene expression of osteocalcin, osteopontin, and core binding factor alpha 1 (Cbfa 1) in human native <b>osteoblasts</b> and adipose derived osteogenic <b>osteoblasts</b> at days 7, 14, 21, and 28 of differentiation. Results: This study demonstrated that native <b>osteoblasts</b> and differentiated <b>osteoblasts,</b> cultured in common osteogenic medium, have significant differences in gene expression levels for osteocalcin and osteopontin.

25|$|The {{three main}} {{mechanisms}} by which osteoporosis develops are an inadequate peak bone mass (the skeleton develops insufficient mass and strength during growth), excessive bone resorption, and inadequate formation of new bone during remodeling, likely due to MSC biasing away from the <b>osteoblast</b> and toward the marrow adipocyte lineage. An interplay of these three mechanisms underlies the development of fragile bone tissue. Hormonal factors strongly determine the rate of bone resorption; lack of estrogen (e.g. {{as a result of}} menopause) increases bone resorption, as well as decreasing the deposition of new bone that normally takes place in weight-bearing bones. The amount of estrogen needed to suppress this process is lower than that normally needed to stimulate the uterus and breast gland. The α-form of the estrogen receptor appears {{to be the most important}} in regulating bone turnover. In addition to estrogen, calcium metabolism plays a significant role in bone turnover, and deficiency of calcium and vitamin D leads to impaired bone deposition; in addition, the parathyroid glands react to low calcium levels by secreting parathyroid hormone (parathormone, PTH), which increases bone resorption to ensure sufficient calcium in the blood. The role of calcitonin, a hormone generated by the thyroid that increases bone deposition, is less clear and probably not as significant as that of PTH.|$|E

Osteoporosis is also an issue in Cushing's syndrome since <b>osteoblast</b> activity is inhibited. Additionally, Cushing's syndrome may cause sore and aching joints, particularly in the hip, shoulders, and lower back. [...] Cushing’s syndrome includes all the causes of increased cortisol leading to the diseased state. [...] Cushing’s disease is a specific type of Cushing’s syndrome caused by a pituitary tumor leading to excessive production of ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone). Excessive ACTH stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce high levels of cortisol, producing the disease state. Cushing's disease due to excess ACTH may also result in hyperpigmentation. This is due to Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone production as a byproduct of ACTH synthesis from Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). Alternatively, it is proposed that the high levels of ACTH, β-lipotropin, and γ-lipotropin, which contain weak MSH function, can act on the melanocortin 1 receptor. A variant of Cushing's disease can be caused by ectopic, i.e. extrapituitary, ACTH production from, for example, a small-cell lung cancer. When Cushing's syndrome is caused by an increase of cortisol {{at the level of the}} adrenal glands (via an adenoma or hyperplasia), negative feedback ultimately reduces ACTH production in the pituitary. In these cases, ACTH levels remain low and no hyperpigmentation develops. [...] While all Cushing’s disease gives Cushing’s syndrome, not all Cushing’s syndrome is due to Cushing’s disease.|$|E

In {{the very}} young rabbit, the limb bones, {{vertebral}} column, {{and many of the}} skull bones are simply plates and bars of cartilage; the future membrane bones, however are planned out in connective tissue. The development of the latter is simple, the connective tissue corpuscles functioning by a simple change of product as <b>osteoblast.</b> The development of the cartilage bones, however, is more complicated. Figure XVII., represents, in a diagrammatic way, the stages in the conversion of a cartilaginous bar to bone. To begin with, the previously sporadically-arranged (scattered anyhow) corpuscles (u.c.c.) are gathered into groups in single file, or in other words, into [...] "columnar" [...] groups (as at c.c.). The matrix becomes clouded with inorganic salts of lime, and it is then said to be calcified. This calcified cartilage then undergoes absorption-- it must not be imagined for a moment that bone is calcified cartilage. Simultaneous with the formation of the cavities (s.) due to this absorption, connective tissue (p.c.i.) from the surrounding perichondrium (p.c.) grows into the ossifying* bar. It is from this connective tissue that the osteoblasts (o.b.) arise, and bone is built up. Throughout life a bone is continually being absorbed and reformed by the activity of the osteoblasts. An <b>osteoblast</b> engaged in the absorption instead of the formation of bone is called an osteoclast.|$|E

Metabolic and morphologic modifications in this tissue contribute to the degradation of the overlaying cartilage. It was suggested that abnormal mechanical pressure exerted onto the articulation was responsible to these changes. Here, we evaluated the effects of compression on <b>osteoblasts</b> from subchondral bone. Method. <b>Osteoblasts</b> were isolated from sclerotic (SC) or non-sclerotic (NSC) areas of human OA subchondral bone. After 28 days, <b>osteoblasts</b> were surrounded by their matrix. This osteoblasts-containing membrane was then placed onto a Biopress Flexercell plate and submitted to a 4 h 1. 67 MPa compression (1 Hz). Expression of IL- 6, IL- 8, COX- 2, VEGF, IGF- 1, OPG and RANKL was evaluated by RT-PCR. IL- 6, IL- 8 and PGE 2 were quantified by ELISA. Results. Basal IL- 6, VEGF, COX- 2, IGF- 1 and RANKL mRNA levels were significantly increased in SC <b>osteoblasts</b> as compared to NSC. By contrast, SC <b>osteoblasts</b> expressed less OPG than those from NSC areas. Compressions induced the expression of genes coding for IL- 6, IL- 8, COX- 2, IGF- 1, VEGF and RANKL but decreased the expression of OPG in NSC <b>osteoblasts</b> (p< 0. 01). Interestingly, compressed NSC <b>osteoblasts</b> expressed similar levels of these genes than SC <b>osteoblasts.</b> Conclusions.

Several studies suggested that <b>osteoblasts</b> regulate hematopoiesis, yet the entire mechanism is not understood. It is clear, however, that both hematopoietic precursors and <b>osteoblasts</b> interact for the production of osteoclasts and the activation of resorption. We observed that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) regulate osteoblastic secretion of various growth factors, and that <b>osteoblasts</b> express some soluble factors exclusively in the presence of HSCs. <b>Osteoblasts</b> and hematopoietic cells are closely associated with each other in the bone marrow, suggesting a reciprocal relationship between them to develop the HSC niche. One critical component regulating the niche is stromal-derived factor- 1 (SDF- 1) and its receptor CXCR 4 which regulates stem cell homing and, as we have recently demonstrated, plays a crucial role in facilitating those tumors which metastasize to bone. <b>Osteoblasts</b> produce abundant amounts of SDF- 1 and therefore <b>osteoblasts</b> {{play an important role in}} metastasis. These findings are discussed in the context of the role of <b>osteoblasts</b> in marrow function in health and disease...|$|R
30|$|Equation (1 c) {{represents}} {{the rate of}} change of the number of active <b>osteoblasts.</b> The first term on the right-hand side accounts for the production of active <b>osteoblasts</b> depending on the production and differentiation of active osteoclasts. That is, the more active osteoclasts, the more active <b>osteoblasts</b> are needed to refill the resorption cavities on BMUs created by active osteoclasts [1 – 3]. The second term on the right-hand side accounts for the inhibiting effect of PRL on the production of active <b>osteoblasts</b> which has been reported in [15]. The last term on the right-hand side accounts for the removal rate of active <b>osteoblasts</b> from the system.|$|R
50|$|<b>Osteoblast</b> are {{responsible}} for the mineralization and construction of bone matrix. Like osteoclast cells, <b>osteoblast</b> cell activity is directly related to extracellular pH mirroring of osteoclast activity. At pH 7.4, where osteoclasts are inactive, <b>osteoblast</b> are at peak activity. Likewise, at pH 6.9 <b>osteoblast</b> activity is non-existent. The hormone estrogen is also important for <b>osteoblast</b> regulation. In postmenopausal women estrogen levels are decreased which has negative effects on bone remodelling. Homocysteine further exacerbates this problem by reducing estrogen receptor α mRNA transcription. Thus reducing any beneficial effect that estrogen plays on bone remodelling.|$|E
50|$|Expression of {{the mature}} miR-764-5p {{sequence}} is upregulated during <b>osteoblast</b> differentiation in both skull-specific calvarial and <b>osteoblast</b> progenitor cells. The channel-forming integral protein, CHIP, is regulated by miR-764-5p at its 3'UTR, {{and there is}} negative correlation between expression of the two. Increased CHIP levels are observed with inhibition of miR-764-5p, whilst enhanced miR-764-3p expression sees decreased CHIP levels. The differentiation fate of <b>osteoblast</b> progenitor cells is altered by impaired miR-764-3p levels due to CHIP. <b>Osteoblast</b> differentiation from progenitor cells {{has been shown to}} be positively regulated by repressed CHIP translation.|$|E
50|$|Similarly to A2A {{receptor}}, the A2B receptor promotes <b>osteoblast</b> differentiation. The <b>osteoblast</b> cell {{is derived}} from the Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) which can also differentiate into a chondrocyte. The cell signalling involved in the stimulation of the A2B receptor directs the route of differentiation to <b>osteoblast,</b> rather than chondrocyte via the Runx2 gene expression. Potential therapeutic application in aiding bone degenerative diseases, age related changes as well as injury repair.|$|E
25|$|Osteocytes {{are mostly}} {{inactive}} <b>osteoblasts.</b> Osteocytes originate from <b>osteoblasts</b> that have migrated into and become trapped {{and surrounded by}} bone matrix that they themselves produced. The spaces they occupy are known as lacunae. Osteocytes have many processes that reach out to meet <b>osteoblasts</b> and other osteocytes probably {{for the purposes of}} communication.|$|R
40|$|International audienceBone {{fragility}} {{and loss}} {{are a significant}} cause of morbidity in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), {{and the lack of}} effective therapeutic options means that treatment is more often palliative rather than curative. A deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of CF-related bone disease (CFBD) is necessary to develop new therapies. Defective CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein and chronic inflammation in bone are important components of the CFBD development. The receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) drive the regulation of bone turnover. To investigate their roles in CFBD, we evaluated the involvement of defective CFTR in their production level in CF primary human <b>osteoblasts</b> with and without inflammatory stimulation, in the presence or not of pharmacological correctors of the CFTR. No major difference in cell ultrastructure was noted between cultured CF and non-CF <b>osteoblasts,</b> but a delayed bone matrix mineralization was observed in CF <b>osteoblasts.</b> Strikingly, resting CF <b>osteoblasts</b> exhibited strong production of RANKL protein, which was highly localized at the cell membrane and was enhanced in TNF (TNF-í µí») or IL- 17 -stimulated conditions. Under TNF stimulation, a defective response in OPG production was observed in CF <b>osteoblasts</b> in contrast to the elevated OPG production of non-CF <b>osteoblasts,</b> leading to an elevated RANKL-to-OPG protein ratio in CF <b>osteoblasts.</b> Pharmacological inhibition of CFTR chloride channel conductance in non-CF <b>osteoblasts</b> replicated both the decreased OPG production and the enhanced RANKL-to-OPG ratio. Interestingly, using CFTR correctors such as C 18, we significantly reduced the production of RANKL by CF <b>osteoblasts,</b> in both resting and TNF-stimulated conditions. In conclusion, the overexpression of RANKL and high membranous RANKL localization in <b>osteoblasts</b> are related to defective CFTR, and may worsen bone resorption, leading to bone loss in patients with CF. Targeting <b>osteoblasts</b> with CFTR correctors may represent an effective strategy to treat CFBD...|$|R
40|$|SummaryWhile mammals have {{a limited}} {{capacity}} to repair bone defects, zebrafish can completely regenerate amputated bony structures of their fins. Fin regeneration is dependent on formation of a blastema, a progenitor cell pool accumulating at the amputation plane. It is unclear which cells the blastema is derived from, whether it forms by dedifferentiation of mature cells, and whether blastema cells are multipotent. We show that mature <b>osteoblasts</b> dedifferentiate and form part of the blastema. <b>Osteoblasts</b> downregulate expression of intermediate and late bone differentiation markers and induce genes expressed by bone progenitors. Dedifferentiated <b>osteoblasts</b> proliferate in a FGF-dependent manner and migrate to form part of the blastema. Genetic fate mapping shows that <b>osteoblasts</b> only give rise to <b>osteoblasts</b> in the regenerate, indicating that dedifferentiation is not associated with the attainment of multipotency. Thus, bone can regenerate from mature <b>osteoblasts</b> via dedifferentiation, a finding with potential implications for human bone repair...|$|R
