He stated that his Department did not intend to amend the relevant Air Navigation Order to require pilots of four-engine aeroplanes to perform the periodic checks in a four-engine aeroplane because it considered it was more challenging to fly with <b>one</b> <b>engine</b> <b>inoperative</b> in a two-engine aeroplane than in a four-engine aeroplane.|$|E
25|$|Turbine {{engines in}} use on today’s turbine-powered {{aircraft}} are very reliable. Engines operate efficiently with regularly scheduled inspections and maintenance. These units can have lives ranging {{in the thousands}} of hours of operation. However, engine malfunctions or failures occasionally occur that require an engine {{to be shut down}} in flight. Since multi-engine airplanes are designed to fly with <b>one</b> <b>engine</b> <b>inoperative</b> and flight crews are trained to fly with <b>one</b> <b>engine</b> <b>inoperative,</b> the in-flight shutdown of an engine typically does not constitute a serious safety of flight issue. Following an engine shutdown, a precautionary landing is usually performed with airport fire and rescue equipment positioned near the runway. Once the airplane lands, fire department personnel assist with inspecting the airplane to ensure it is safe before it taxis to its parking position. Turboprop-powered aircraft and turboshaft-powered helicopters are also powered by turbine engines and are subject to engine failures for many similar reasons as jet-powered aircraft. In the case of an engine failure in a helicopter, it is often possible for the pilot to enter autorotation, using the unpowered rotor to slow the aircraft's descent and provide a measure of control, usually allowing for a safe emergency landing even without engine power.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{inherent}} risks of operating at {{or close to}} VMCa with asymmetric thrust, {{and the desire to}} simulate and practise these manoeuvres in pilot training and certification VSSE may be defined. VSSE safe single-engine speed is the minimum speed to intentionally render the critical engine inoperative, established and designated by the manufacturer as the safe, intentional, <b>one</b> <b>engine</b> <b>inoperative</b> speed. This speed is selected to reduce the accident potential from loss of control due to simulated engine failures at inordinately slow airspeed.|$|E
25|$|Most {{test pilot}} schools use multiple, more {{specific}} minimum control speeds, as VMC will change {{depending on the}} stage of flight. Other defined VMCs include minimum control speed on the ground (VMCG) and minimum control speed during approach and landing (VMCL). In addition, with aircraft with four or more engines, VMCs exist for cases with either <b>one</b> or two <b>engines</b> <b>inoperative</b> on the same wing. Figure 1 illustrates the VMCs that are defined in the relevant civil aviation regulations and in military specifications.|$|R
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of commercial operation twin-engine airplanes are limited to flying in a distance equivalent to 60 minutes, with <b>one</b> <b>inoperative</b> <b>engine,</b> from an airport. This limitation restricted for years the twin-engine operation on very important route such as the North Atlantic route, between United States and Europe. Based on requests from operator and aircraft manufactures during the 1980 s the American aviation authority - FAA - issued an extension allowing the operation beyond the 60 -minute rule. This extension was called ETOPS. With this extension the commercial operator of a twin-engine airplane should fly distances higher than the old one correspondent to 60 minutes distance, with <b>one</b> <b>inoperative</b> <b>engine.</b> Following FAA decision, several aviation authorities issued an extension for the 60 -minute rule and ETOPS operation has been working {{as an extension of}} a regulation for more than 20 years. Because of this particularity, in 2000, FAA created a workgroup to discuss ETOPS operation and include its requirements within the official regulation (14 CFR), including the parts for product certification and operation, allowing that the airplane should be optionally certified for ETOPS operation, and its operation depending only on the operator certification. This dissertation details the FAA ETOPS rule and, at the end, demonstrate the EMBRAER airplane ERJ 190 - 100 capability for its operation...|$|R
50|$|When <b>one</b> <b>engine</b> becomes <b>inoperative,</b> a {{yawing moment}} develops, the {{magnitude}} of which {{is equal to the}} lateral distance of the thrust vector of the operative engine to the center of gravity (C.G.), also called moment arm, multiplied by the thrust of the engine. In addition, a rolling moment might develop due to asymmetrical propulsive lift generated by the wing section behind the operative propeller. These moments yaw and/ or roll the aircraft towards the <b>inoperative</b> <b>engine,</b> a tendency which must be counteracted by the pilot's use of the flight controls: rudder and ailerons. Due to P-factor, a clockwise rotating right-hand propeller on the right wing typically develops its resultant thrust vector at a greater lateral distance from the aircraft's C.G. than the clockwise rotating left-hand propeller (Figure 1). The failure of the left-hand engine will result in a larger remaining yawing moment by the operating right-hand engine, rather than vice versa. Since the operating right-hand engine produces a larger yawing moment, the pilot will need to use larger control deflections in order to maintain aircraft control, or a higher speed. Thus, the failure of the left-hand engine is less desirable than failure of the right-hand engine, and the left-hand engine is called critical.|$|R
500|$|The {{aircraft}} was {{revealed to the}} general public on 3 August 1947 at a flypast at Moscow's Tushino Airfield and the aircraft began its state acceptance trials three days later. Flight testing was completed by 25 May 1948 after 136 flights had been completed. It demonstrated a top speed of [...] at an altitude of [...] and an endurance of one hour and 44 minutes. It had very docile handling qualities with <b>one</b> <b>engine</b> <b>inoperative.</b> The {{aircraft was}} recommended for production, but it was significantly slower than the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-9 and Yakovlev Yak-15. The government declined to do so and the program was terminated.|$|E
500|$|Some {{employees}} of ANA speculated that approximately ten minutes after take-off {{the crew of}} Amana {{were aware of the}} seriousness of rough running on number 4 engine so decided to shut it down. Company procedures specified that if an operational problem occurred prior to reaching Kalgoorlie, [...] east of Perth, the aircraft was to return to Perth; but if a problem occurred after reaching Kalgoorlie the flight could continue to Adelaide. The Douglas DC-4 was capable of flying from Perth to Adelaide with <b>one</b> <b>engine</b> <b>inoperative.</b> The crew of Amana on the fatal flight might have decided to wait until past Kalgoorlie before making a radio call to report one engine had been shut down, and then continue to Adelaide. To manage fuel usage and balance the weight of fuel across the wing, the crew might have selected some of the operating engines to draw fuel from number 4 tank. The DC-4 had a complex fuel selection system and, either deliberately or inadvertently, all operating engines might have been connected to number 4 tank. If the drain cock in the cross-feed pipe was still open to the atmosphere, air would be drawn into the pipe, causing an interruption of fuel supply to the engines, all engines to stop operating and their propellers to move to fine pitch. When the crew realised engines 1, 2 and 3 had all suddenly failed and that cross-feeding of fuel was the source of the problem they would have changed the fuel selections and restored fuel to the engines, causing the sudden screaming noise heard by witnesses as the engines burst back into life with their propellers in fine pitch. Amana had been flying at lower altitude than usual so there was inadequate height for the crew to arrest the high rate of descent before the aircraft struck high ground on the Inkpen family property. (At the Air Court of Inquiry, George Pape, representing ANA, described as [...] "fantastic" [...] any suggestion that the crew of the Amana would be cross-feeding fuel from one wing to the engines on the other wing at such an early stage of the flight.) ...|$|E

40|$|The stability, control, and {{handling}} qualities of an augmented jet flap STOL airplane are presented. The airplane is an extensively modified de Havilland Buffalo military transport. The modified airplane has two fan-jet engines which provide vectorable thrust and compressed air for the augmentor jet flap and Boundary-Layer Control (BLC). The augmentor and BLC air is cross ducted to minimize asymmetric moments produced when <b>one</b> <b>engine</b> is <b>inoperative.</b> The modifications {{incorporated in the}} airplane include a Stability Augmentation System (SAS), a powered elevator, and a powered lateral control system. The test gross weight of the airplane was between 165, 000 and 209, 000 N (37, 000 and 47, 000 lb). Stability, control, {{and handling}} qualities are presented for the airspeed range of 40 to 180 knots. The lateral-directional handling qualities are considered satisfactory for the normal operating range of 65 to 160 knots airspeed when the SAS is functioning. With the SAS inoperative, poor turn coordination and spiral instability are primary deficiencies contributing to marginal handling qualities in the landing approach. The powered elevator control system enhanced the controllability in pitch, particularly in the landing flare and stall recovery...|$|R
50|$|Aviation {{regulations}} (such as FAR and EASA) define {{several different}} VMCs and require design engineers to size the vertical tail and the aerodynamic flight controls {{of the aircraft}} to comply with these regulations. The minimum control speed in the air (VMCA) {{is the most important}} minimum control speed of a multi-engine aircraft, which is why VMCA is simply listed as VMC in many aviation regulations and aircraft flight manuals. On the airspeed indicator of a twin-engine aircraft of less than 2722 kg, the VMCA is indicated by a red radial line, as standardised by FAR 23. Most test pilot schools use multiple, more specific minimum control speeds, as VMC will change depending on the stage of flight. Other defined VMCs include minimum control speed on the ground (VMCG) and minimum control speed during approach and landing (VMCL). In addition, with aircraft with four or more engines, VMCs exist for cases with either <b>one</b> or two <b>engines</b> <b>inoperative</b> on the same wing.

50|$|Bombs {{released}} from a bomber above them struck <b>one</b> of their <b>engines.</b> (Believed by the crew to be the #4, or right outboard engine.) This shut down <b>one</b> <b>engine,</b> but the propeller couldn't be properly feathered and there was damage to the electrical and/or hydraulic systems. Their troubles mounted when they attempted to drop their bombs and the bomb bay doors had to be manually opened and the bomb's released manually. Once the bombs were gone, {{they were unable to}} close the bomb bay doors. The increased drag of a non-feathered propeller and the open bomb bay doors, combined with the lost power from <b>one</b> <b>inoperative</b> <b>engine,</b> caused them to slow down and forced them to fall out of formation. The crew recalls that they were then attacked by German fighter aircraft and they lost one or two more engines and had to drop down to the cloud deck (tops around 5,000') to attempt to continue flying. The aircraft was headed west towards England, but was lower than their formations and unable to keep up. Witness crew members from a 323rd Bomb Squadron aircraft reported losing sight of the missing aircraft about 30 minutes (east of) the Zuider Zee, but that the aircraft was continuing on course, just lower & slower. The witnesses reported that the engines were feathered, but crew statements suggest that the engines were not turning, however the propellers were not feathered either.|$|R

50|$|President Aquino {{revealed}} {{details of}} the accident investigation and its findings during a media briefing on November 13, 2012. The investigation found that improper maintenance led to the right engine suffering an internal failure, which likely would have caused misfiring and intermittent operation of the fuel pump. The failure was gradual and the aircraft developed engine problems 23 minutes after take off. However, instead of turning back to Cebu, the pilot decided to continue the flight, until the engine failed completely 37 minutes later and the aircraft crashed during the subsequent attempt to land at Masbate. The investigation determined that the pilot didn't use the correct procedure for trying to land a Piper Seneca with <b>one</b> <b>engine</b> <b>inoperative,</b> in that he lowered the undercarriage and flaps too soon; and that during his last flight proficiency test {{he had not been}} tested with respect to flying with <b>one</b> <b>engine</b> <b>inoperative.</b>|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} of a 1 / 7 -scale powered model of the Kaiser Fleetwing all-wing airplane {{was made in the}} Langley full-scale tunnel to provide data for an estimation of the flying qualities of the airplane. The analysis of the stability and control characteristics of the airplane has been made as closely as possible in accordance with the requirements of the Bureau of Aeronautics, Navy Department's specifications, and a summary of the more significant conclusions is presented as follows. With the normal center of gravity located at 20 percent of the mean aerodynamic chord, the airplane will have adequate static longitudinal stability, elevator fixed, for all flight conditions except for low-power operation at low speeds where the stability will be about neutral. There will not be sufficient down-elevator deflection available for trim above speeds of about 130 miles per hour. It is probable that the reduction in the up-elevator deflections required for trim will be accompanied by reduced elevator hinge moments for low-power operation at low flight speeds. The static directional stability for this airplane will be low for all rudder-fixed or rudder-free flight conditions. The maximum rudder deflection of 30 deg will trim only about 15 deg yaw for most flight conditions and only 10 deg yaw for the condition with low power at low speeds. Also, at low powers and low speeds, it is estimated that the rudders will not trim the total adverse yaw resulting from an abrupt aileron roll using maximum aileron deflection. The airplane will meet the requirements for stability and control for asymmetric power operation with <b>one</b> outboard <b>engine</b> <b>inoperative.</b> The airplane would have no tendency for directional divergence but would probably be spirally unstable, with rudders fixed. The static lateral stability of the airplane will probably be about neutral for the high-speed flight conditions and will be only slightly increased for the low-power operation in low-speed flight. The airplane will not roll against the ailerons in a side-slip maneuver. Although the airplane would probably meet the minimum requirements of pb/ 2 V of 0. 07 at all speeds, there will be a loss in rolling ability of the airplane at high aileron deflections and at low flight speeds. It is estimated that the wing stall will be a gradual movement forward from the trailing edge and will be accompanied by no sudden pitching or rolling accelerations. Some stall warning may be indicated by reduction in the elevator and aileron force gradients and by the shaking of the controls caused by unsteady flow over the surfaces near the stall...|$|R

5000|$|Sound {{analysis}} of the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recordings revealed that the drag produced by the propeller exceeded the thrust produced. The investigation later stated: [...] "The drag on an engine at flight idle {{is greater than the}} drag on an <b>inoperative</b> <b>engine</b> (OEI), {{and in the case of}} 9N-AHA where the flight idle fuel flow was incorrectly set too low, the drag would have been even greater at idle (in excess of 350 lb of drag - reference section 1.16.2). It is therefore possible that at about 6,200 kg with <b>one</b> <b>engine</b> at 100% power and <b>one</b> <b>engine</b> at flight idle, there would have been insufficient thrust to maintain 77 kt, and the additional drag on one side would have affected controllability more than in the OEI case" ...|$|R
