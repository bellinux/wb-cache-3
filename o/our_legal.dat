25|$|Clinical {{education}} at Northwestern {{dates back to}} the Law School’s beginnings. An innovative program developed by Dean John Henry Wigmore in 1910 with the Chicago Legal Aid Society evolved into the Legal Clinic, which opened its doors in 1969 with only two staff attorneys. In 2000, the Clinic was named for Northwestern University trustee and alum Neil Bluhm. Today, the Bluhm Legal Clinic houses more than 20 clinics within 14 centers and is widely {{recognized as one of the}} most comprehensive and effective clinical programs in the country. Through the Law School's clinical program, students gain direct experience representing clients and fine-tune their skills as advocates. They also work with clinical faculty and staff to challenge the fairness of <b>our</b> <b>legal</b> institutions and to propose solutions for reform.|$|E

Tillman, however, called the settlement a [...] "great victory", saying, [...] "we didn't admit to anything, all the charges were dropped, we're not paying anything (in damages), and we preserve our rights to pursue efforts to have <b>our</b> <b>legal</b> fees paid". At the time the lawsuit was settled, Nelson did not issue any statements. The Chicago Tribune reported that he was employed as an advertising artist at an undisclosed firm; he continued to paint in his free time. As of 1994, the painting had not been sold, exhibited, or repaired after the incident.|$|E

He has stated that [...] "The book incites hatred and killing and therefore has no place in <b>our</b> <b>legal</b> order". He has also referred to Mohammed as [...] "the devil". In September 2009, Wilders proposed putting what he called a [...] "head rag tax" [...] on Hijab wearing by Muslim women; he suggested that women could purchase a license for €1000 and that the money raised could be used in projects beneficial to women's emancipation.|$|E

500|$|The Commission {{recommended}} various changes, such as {{reducing the}} use of the death penalty, allowing defendants access to legal counsel, legal aid and the abolition of peine forte et dure as a torture mechanism. Dissolved on 23 July 1652 after producing 16 bills, none of the Commission's recommendations immediately made it into law, although two (to abolish fines for original writs and to develop procedures for civil marriages) were brought into force through statutes by the Barebone's Parliament. Almost all of the recommendations eventually became part of English law, with John Hostettler, in his biography of Hale, writing that if the measures had been put into law immediately, [...] "we would have been honouring such pioneers for their farsightedness in enhancing <b>our</b> <b>legal</b> system and the concept of justice".|$|E
500|$|Although {{alternative}} {{options to}} {{doing business with}} China are few for the business sector, many companies large and small, including within the important financial sector, are uneasy about the changing political climate. The head of the one business association in Hong Kong said: [...] "The middle-class, the professionals, even the accountants: people are just freaked out {{about what is going}} on... The last bastion of Hong Kong's guarantees is the law. What we have left is <b>our</b> <b>legal</b> system, but people fear that this may be under attack too". Steve Vickers, the principal of one local risk assessment firm said: [...] "The Hong Kong government appears to now have considerably diminished autonomy and the liaison office seems to be strengthening its position, [...] certainly sent a chill through the business and social arenas in Hong Kong".|$|E
500|$|Academic {{debate over}} the Commission's value has been strong. On the one hand, William Holdsworth wrote that the Commission was riven by strife between its lawyerly members and those of a more radical nature, and that its {{proposals}} were sometimes extreme. Other academics argued that the reform scheme was of great merit, and Hostettler, writes that [...] "there {{is no evidence to}} confirm the belief of Sir William Holdsworth that the lawyers had a difficult time with the laymen". Mary Cotterell, writing in the English Historical Review, notes that 13 of the 21 members were certainly not radicals, although Moyer and Bemers, Blount and Peters certainly were. The lawyers, all moderates, nevertheless dominated the discussions. Debate was on a highly technical level which prevented many of the laymen contributing much, although six of them had been educated at the Inns of Court. The large number of meetings and sheer volume of work produced also suggests that there was little dissent and argument. John Hostettler, in his biography of Hale, has suggested that if the measures had been put into law immediately, [...] "we would have been honouring such pioneers for their farsightedness in enhancing <b>our</b> <b>legal</b> system and the concept of justice".|$|E

500|$|Conversely, Andrew Harding {{has argued}} that the idea of {{substantive}} natural justice is vague and subjective, and has taken the view that fundamental rules of natural justice are entirely procedural in nature. In his opinion, Article 12(1) of the Constitution is designed to prevent substantively discriminatory legislation. To determine whether legislation is discriminatory, a [...] is applied. It would be strange if legislation that passed this test could nonetheless be struck down due to inconsistency with natural justice. Therefore, the extension of Article 12(1) to include natural justice shows that the Privy Council in Ong Ah Chuan could not have intended to apply natural justice in a substantive sense. Further support for this argument {{can be found in the}} Privy Council's decision Haw Tua Tau v. Public Prosecutor (1981) which discussed fundamental rules of natural justice in a procedural context, their Lordships stating that they had to consider [...] "whether the consequence of the alteration [...] is a procedure for the trial of criminal offences that is contrary to some fundamental rule of natural justice". The substantive review of legislation by the court was also rejected in Jabar bin Kadermastan v. Public Prosecutor (1995), the Court of Appeal holding that [...] "any law which provides for the deprivation of a person's life or personal liberty, is valid and binding so long as it is validly passed by Parliament. The court is not concerned with whether it is also fair, just and reasonable as well." [...] Subsequently, in Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General (2011), the Court held that fundamental rules of natural justice and the principles of natural justice in administrative law [...] "are the same in nature and function, except that they operate at different levels of <b>our</b> <b>legal</b> order, one to invalidate legislation on the ground of unconstitutionality, and the other to invalidate administrative decisions on the ground of administrative law principles".|$|E

The paper examines the important relationship between law, ethics, economics and science and provides a framework for teaching the cross-influences among these subjects to modern business students.
