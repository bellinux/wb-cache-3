5|$|Following {{the reunification}} of Jerusalem in 1967, the city {{embarked}} on significant expansion. Large commercial centers were opened in the new, outlying neighborhoods of Talpiot, Givat Shaul, and Malha, weaning customers {{away from the city}} center. Government offices began moving <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> precipitating the economic decline of the Downtown Triangle in the 1970s. The advent of television precipitated the closure of most of the Triangle's cinemas. The Zion Cinema closed in 1972 and was demolished. In its place, a high-rise building containing the Kikar Zion Hotel (on the upper floors) and a branch of Bank Hapoalim (on the lower floors) was erected.|$|E

Additionally, the entire Australian leg sold out within hours, leading Carey to extend the tour one more date in the United States. The show at Hawaii's 50,000 capacity Aloha Stadium sold <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> making her {{one of the few}} acts in the stadiums history to sell out the entire venue. Aside from its commercial success, fans and critics raved about the show's visuals, as well as Carey's vocal delivery.|$|E

5|$|Between 1963 and 1965, {{archaeological sites}} and remains were located {{with the help}} of aerial photographs, and a ground survey was carried <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> to {{determine}} the periods that were present at each site. Between 1965 and 1970, foreign archaeological missions carried out systematic excavations at the sites of Mureybet (United States), Tell Qannas (Belgium), Habuba Kabira, Mumbaqa (Germany), Selenkahiye (Netherlands), and Emar (France). With help from UNESCO, two minarets at Mureybet and Meskene were photogrammetrically measured, and a protective glacis was built around the castle Qal'at Ja'bar. The castle was located on a hilltop that would not be flooded, but the lake would turn it in an island. The castle is now connected to the shore by a causeway.|$|E

Government offices began moving <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> precipitating the economic decline of the Downtown Triangle in the 1970s. The clientele of the upscale European boutiques had also aged, and the neighborhoods adjacent to downtown became occupied by poor and Haredi Jews who did not patronize the Triangle. The elegant shops gave way to hummus restaurants, dollar stores, and money changers. The advent of television precipitated the closure of most of the Triangle's cinemas.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí {{devoted his}} life entirely to his profession, {{remaining}} single. He {{is known to have}} been attracted to only one woman—Josefa Moreu, teacher at the Mataró Cooperative, in 1884—but this was not reciprocated. Thereafter Gaudí took refuge in the profound spiritual peace his Catholic faith offered him. Gaudí is often depicted as unsociable and unpleasant, a man of gruff reactions and arrogant gestures. However, those who were close to him described him as friendly and polite, pleasant to talk to and faithful to friends. Among these, his patrons Eusebi Güell and the bishop of Vic, Josep Torras i Bages, stand <b>out,</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as the writers Joan Maragall and Jacint Verdaguer, the physician Pere Santaló and some of his most faithful collaborators, such as Francesc Berenguer and Llorenç Matamala.|$|E

The digital recording was played back providing a high quality analogue signal to master the lacquer–aluminium cut.|$|R
5|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, the NY30 designation was reassigned elsewhere, leaving just US4 on {{the portion of}} highway that US4 now shares with NY149. At the same time, all of NY24 south of Middle Granville became part of NY22 while NY149 {{was assigned to the}} portion of its modern alignment between NY9L in Queensbury and NY22 south of the village of Granville. In July 1935, several floods devastated many highways in the state of New York. One highway affected was NY149, as a bridge carrying the highway in the hamlet of South Granville was washed out. With the bridge out, drivers were detoured onto a town highway (now maintained by Washington County as CR27) to access NY22 and Granville from South Granville and to access NY40 from Granville. NY22 was also affected by the flood as a bridge in the town of Cambridge was washed <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>well.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the downstairs}} lounge, {{a few minutes}} before the Act 2 curtain for Me and Juliet rises, the ushers comment on the {{remarkable}} conclusion to Act 1—although the audience has noticed nothing unusual ("Intermission Talk"). As Act 2 of the internal show starts, an enraged Bob is searching the theatre for Jeannie and Larry. Unable to find them, he takes up position at a bar across the street where he can watch the theatre doors ("It Feels Good"). The perspective shifts to the onstage action in Me and Juliet, where Don Juan and Carmen are on a date ("We Deserve Each Other"), before moving to the manager's office where Larry and Jeanie are hiding out ("I'm Your Girl"). Mac has only just begun his lecture to them when Bob enters through the window, having heard familiar voices. In the ensuing fight, Bob knocks out Mac, but when the electrician grabs for Jeannie, Larry strongly defends her. The fight ends when Bob accidentally hits his head on a radiator and is knocked <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>well.</b>|$|E
5|$|Norman Biggs {{was born}} in Cardiff to John and Emily Biggs. His father, who lived at Park Place in {{the centre of the}} city, was a brewer by trade who owned {{businesses}} in Cardiff and Bristol. Biggs was privately educated at several proprietary schools including Lewinsdale School in Weston-super-Mare, before matriculating to University College Cardiff and later Trinity Hall, Cambridge, playing rugby for both university teams. It was reported that Biggs should have won a sporting 'Blue' while at Cambridge, but an injury to his ribs ruled him <b>out.</b> <b>As</b> <b>well</b> as playing rugby, Biggs was a keen sprinter {{and he was able to}} run 100 yards in even time, and was able to beat world sprint champion Charlton Monypenny at this distance. On returning to Cardiff he joined his father's brewing business. In 1887, Biggs played his first senior game for Cardiff RFC, in a match against Penarth. Biggs came from a large sporting family and was one of six brothers to play rugby for Cardiff. His most notable brothers were Selwyn, who also played for Wales, and Cecil, who captained Cardiff during their 1904/05 season.|$|E
