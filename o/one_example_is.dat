5|$|Cadmium-selective sensors {{based on}} the {{fluorophore}} BODIPY {{have been developed for}} imaging and sensing of cadmium in cells. One of the most popular way to monitor cadmium in aqueous environments is the use of electrochemistry, <b>one</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> by attaching a self-assembled monolayer that can help obtain a cadmium selective electrode with a ppt-level sensitivity.|$|E

5|$|Now {{companies}} are offering more eco-friendly alternatives for their customers. Recycled products for example, {{are one of}} the most popular alternatives that can benefit the environment. These benefits include sustainable forestry, clean air, energy efficiency, water conservation, and a healthy office. <b>One</b> <b>example,</b> <b>is</b> the E-commerce business and office supply company Shoplet which offers a web tool that allows you to replace similar items in your shopping cart with greener products.|$|E
5|$|Pratchett {{is known}} for a {{distinctive}} writing style that included a number of characteristic hallmarks. <b>One</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> his use of footnotes, which usually involve a comic departure from the narrative or a commentary on the narrative, and occasionally have footnotes of their own.|$|E

5|$|The myth {{influenced}} popular {{religion as}} well. <b>One</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the magical healing spells based on Horus's childhood. Another {{is the use}} of the Eye of Horus as a protective emblem in personal apotropaic amulets. Its mythological restoration made it appropriate for this purpose, as a general symbol of well-being.|$|E
5|$|There are {{thousands}} of uses of various potassium compounds. <b>One</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> potassium superoxide, , an orange solid {{that acts as a}} portable source of oxygen and a carbon dioxide absorber. It is widely used in respiration systems in mines, submarines and spacecraft as it takes less volume than the gaseous oxygen.|$|E

5|$|To {{maintain}} dynamic equilibrium {{and effectively}} carry out certain functions, a system must detect {{and respond to}} perturbations. After the detection of a perturbation, a biological system normally responds through negative feedback that stabilize conditions by reducing or increasing the activity of an organ or system. <b>One</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the release of glucagon when sugar levels are too low.|$|E
5|$|Ancient texts use ahimsa to mean non-injury, {{a broader}} concept than non-violence. Non-injury implies not killing others, {{as well as}} not hurting others mentally or verbally; it {{includes}} avoiding all violent means—including physical violence—anything that injures others. In classical Sanskrit literature of Hinduism, another word Adrohi is sometimes used instead of Ahimsa, {{as one of the}} cardinal virtues necessary for moral life. <b>One</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> in Baudhayana Dharmasutra 2.6.23: वाङ्-मनः-कर्म-दण्डैर् भूतानाम् अद्रोही (One who does not injure others with words, thoughts or acts is named Adrohi).|$|E
5|$|As most Vietnamese are {{stateless}} residents, {{they seek}} a living through ad-hoc various {{industries such as}} the construction, recycling and prostitution industries or as street pedlars. Vietnamese that live along the Tonle Sap lake and Mekong rivers are subsistence fishermen. A sizeable number of these stateless Vietnamese consisted of migrants that came to Cambodia between 1992 and 1993 during the UNTAC administration. The majority of Vietnamese still {{live below the poverty}} line, although {{a very small number of}} Vietnamese are represented in the Cambodian business sector. <b>One</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> Sok Kong, the head of the business conglomerate Sokimex which owns state concessionaires in the country's petroleum, tourism and entrepot industries.|$|E

5|$|Chemical {{communications}} in animals {{rely on a}} variety of aspects including taste and smell. Chemoreception is the physiological response of a sense organ (i.e. taste or smell) to a chemical stimulus where the chemicals act as signals to regulate the state or activity of a cell. A semiochemical is a message-carrying chemical that is meant to attract, repel, and convey information. Types of semiochemicals include pheromones and kairomones. <b>One</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the butterfly Phengaris arion which uses chemical signals as a form of mimicry to aid in predation.|$|E
5|$|His {{collection}} is vast and diverse, and includes Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and Indian pieces {{dating from the}} 10th century. <b>One</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> a Quranic page of North African origin written with gold lettering in the Kufic script – {{it is more than}} 1,000 years old. Prince Sadruddin's Persian roots are well represented in calligraphic as well as pictoral specimens reflecting a range of periods and dynastic patrons. Also included are several examples of Ottoman callgraphies, manuscripts and paintings.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{focusing}} on individual organisms, paleoecology examines the interactions between different organisms, such as their places in food chains, and the two-way interaction between organisms and their environment.  <b>One</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the development of oxygenic photosynthesis by bacteria, which hugely increased the productivity and diversity of ecosystems. This also caused the oxygenation of the atmosphere. Together, these were a prerequisite {{for the evolution of}} the most complex eukaryotic cells, from which all multicellular organisms are built.|$|E

5|$|Several other {{geometrical}} {{solutions to}} Apollonius' problem {{were developed in}} the 19th century. The most notable solutions are those of Jean-Victor Poncelet (1811) and of Joseph Diaz Gergonne (1814). Whereas Poncelet's proof relies on homothetic centers of circles {{and the power of}} a point theorem, Gergonne's method exploits the conjugate relation between lines and their poles in a circle. Methods using circle inversion were pioneered by Julius Petersen in 1879; <b>one</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the annular solution method of HSM Coxeter. Another approach uses Lie sphere geometry, which was developed by Sophus Lie.|$|E
5|$|Theoretical {{understanding}} of {{condensed matter physics}} {{is closely related to}} the notion of emergence, wherein complex assemblies of particles behave in ways dramatically different from their individual constituents. For example, a range of phenomena related to high temperature superconductivity are understood poorly, although the microscopic physics of individual electrons and lattices is well known. Similarly, models of condensed matter systems have been studied where collective excitations behave like photons and electrons, thereby describing electromagnetism as an emergent phenomenon. Emergent properties can also occur at the interface between materials: <b>one</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the lanthanum aluminate-strontium titanate interface, where two non-magnetic insulators are joined to create conductivity, superconductivity, and ferromagnetism.|$|E
5|$|Type III toxin-antitoxin systems rely {{on direct}} {{interaction}} between a toxic protein and an RNA antitoxin. The toxic {{effects of the}} protein are neutralised by the RNA gene. <b>One</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the ToxIN system from the bacterial plant pathogen Erwinia carotovora. The toxic ToxN protein is approximately 170 amino acids long and {{has been shown to}} be toxic to E. coli. The toxic activity of ToxN is inhibited by ToxI RNA, an RNA with 5.5 direct repeats of a 36 nucleotide motif (AGGTGATTTGCTACCTTTAAGTGCAGCTAGAAATTC). Crystallographic analysis of ToxIN has found that ToxN inhibition requires the formation of a trimeric ToxIN complex, whereby three ToxI monomers bind three ToxN monomers; the complex is held together by extensive protein-RNA interactions.|$|E
