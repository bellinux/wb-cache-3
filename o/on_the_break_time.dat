40|$|Two-dimensional {{nonlinear}} {{gravity waves}} travelling {{in shallow water}} on a vertically sheared current of constant vorticity are considered. Using Euler equations, in the shallow water approximation, hyper-bolic equations for the surface elevation and the horizontal velocity are derived. Using Riemann invariants of these equations, that are obtained analytically, a closed-form nonlinear evolution equation for the surface elevation is derived. A dispersive term is added to this equation using the exact linear dispersion relation. With this new single first-order partial differential equation, vorticity effects on undular bores are studied. Within the framework of weakly nonlinear waves, a KdV-type equation and a Whitham equation with constant vorticity are derived from this new model {{and the effect of}} vorticity on solitary waves and periodic waves is considered.

40|$|In modern {{semiconductor}} devices, {{only the}} charge of electrons is being utilized for the manipulation and transport of information. The spin degree of freedom of the electrons has not been exploited in any commercial semiconductor application so far. People {{in the field of}} Spintronics are trying to find new or improved functionalities and applications that are based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spin of electrons, instead of - or in addition to - its charge. Some of these new ideas are based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> binary nature of the electron spin, which makes that it could serve as an elementary digital bit. When the spin state can be transported and manipulated in space and time, the spin could be used for new calculation schemes, for example. In addition, it has been predicted that the motion of electrons through materials can be affected by acting on their spin state. Hence, the spin could potentially function as a "knob" for tuning the conductivity of electrons. From the above it follows {{that it is important to}} understand mechanisms that allow to manipulate the spin dynamics (i. e. the spin state of electrons). The best-known mechanism to affect the spin dynamics is by an external magnetic field, i. e., via Zeeman coupling to the spin. Another potentially important mechanism is Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI). The interesting and distinguishing feature of Rashba SOI is, that it can be tuned by electrostatic means. This might make it easier to control <b>the</b> spin dynamics <b>on</b> very small length scales, in comparison to Zeeman coupling. Rashba SOI is also known, however, to be the main cause of spin relaxation in many 2 D electron systems, thereby destroying any information that is encrypted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spin. For the field of Spintronics it is therefore important to understand the effects of Rashba SOI, and the interplay between Rashba SOI and Zeeman coupling, on electron transport and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spin dynamics. In this Thesis we have studied partly theoretically and partly experimentally the influence of Rashba SOI on low temperature electron transport in mesoscopic (phase-coherent) systems, such as Hall bars and ring structures. In addition, we have experimentally investigated how the competition between Rashba SOI and Zeeman coupling affects the spin dynamics in 2 D electron gases, and if/how information about the resulting spin dynamics, such as the spin-relaxation time, can be obtained from "simple" transport measurements. Finally, we have studied the effect of the interplay between Rashba SOI and Zeeman coupling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>breaking</b> of <b>time</b> reversal symmetry in 2 D electron gases.
