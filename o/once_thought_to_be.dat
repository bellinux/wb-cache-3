5|$|A coda {{is a short}} {{pattern of}} 3 to 20 clicks that is used in social situations. They were <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a way by which {{individuals}} identified themselves, but individuals have been observed producing multiple codas, and the same codas are used by multiple individuals. However, each click contains a physical signature which suggests that clicks {{can be used to}} identify individuals. Geographically separate pods exhibit distinct dialects. Large males are generally solitary and rarely produce codas. In breeding grounds, codas are almost entirely produced by adult females. Despite evidence that sperm whales share similar codas, it is still unknown whether sperm whales possess individually specific coda repertoires or whether individuals make codas at different rates.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its very}} patchy range, the copper shark has been scientifically {{described}} several times from different locales. The earliest valid description is presently {{considered to be}} British zoologist Albert Günther's account of Carcharias brachyurus in the 1870 eighth volume of Catalogue of the fishes in the British Museum. The earliest name was <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Auguste Duméril's 1865 Carcharias remotus, until {{it was found that}} the type specimen associated with that name is actually a blacknose shark (C. acronotus). Thus, this shark was often referred to as C. remotus in older literature. An even earlier name, Richard Owen's 1853 Galeolamna greyi, is of questionable taxonomic status as it was based solely on a set of now-destroyed jaws that may or may not have belonged to a copper shark. Modern authors have assigned this species to the genus Carcharhinus.|$|E

5|$|Common {{over much}} of the Northern Hemisphere, S.coccinea occurs in the Midwest, in the valleys between the Pacific coast, the Sierra Nevada, and the Cascade Range. Its North American {{distribution}} extends north to various locations in Canada and south to the Mexican state Jalisco. The fungus has also been collected from Chile in South America. It is also found in the Old World—Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, and India. Specimens collected from the Macaronesian islands that <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> S.coccinea were later determined to be the distinct species S.macaronesica. A 1995 study of the occurrence of British Sarcoscypha (including S.coccinea and S.austriaca) concluded that S.coccinea was becoming very rare in Great Britain. All species of Sarcoscypha, including S.coccinea, are Red-Listed in Europe. In Turkey, it is considered critically endangered.|$|E
5|$|Hormonal {{therapy is}} only {{beneficial}} in {{certain types of}} endometrial cancer. It was <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> beneficial in most cases. If a tumor is well-differentiated and known to have progesterone and estrogen receptors, progestins {{may be used in}} treatment. About 25% of metastatic endometrioid cancers show a response to progestins. Also, endometrial stromal sarcomas can be treated with hormonal agents, including tamoxifen, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, letrozole, megestrol acetate, and medroxyprogesterone. This treatment is effective in endometrial stromal sarcomas because they typically have estrogen and/or progestin receptors. Progestin receptors function as tumor suppressors in endometrial cancer cells. Preliminary research and clinical trials have shown these treatments to have a high rate of response even in metastatic disease.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} other {{skeletal}} features are shared by dinosaurs. However, because they are either common to other groups of archosaurs or were not present in all early dinosaurs, these features are {{not considered to be}} synapomorphies. For example, as diapsids, dinosaurs ancestrally had two pairs of temporal fenestrae (openings in the skull behind the eyes), and as members of the diapsid group Archosauria, had additional openings in the snout and lower jaw. Additionally, several characteristics <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaurs, or were absent in the earliest dinosaurs and independently evolved by different dinosaur groups. These include an elongated scapula, or shoulder blade; a sacrum composed of three or more fused vertebrae (three are found in some other archosaurs, but only two are found in Herrerasaurus); and a perforate acetabulum, or hip socket, with a hole at the center of its inside surface (closed in Saturnalia, for example). Another difficulty of determining distinctly dinosaurian features is that early dinosaurs and other archosaurs from the late Triassic are often poorly known and were similar in many ways; these animals have sometimes been misidentified in the literature.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} of the tammar wallaby exists from the late Pleistocene era—remains {{were found in the}} Naracoorte Caves. The mainland and island dwelling tammars split from each other 7,000–15,000 years ago, while the South Australian and Western Australian animals diverged around 50,000 years ago. The tammar wallabies on Flinders Island had greyer coats and thinner heads than the Kangaroo Island tammars, which are larger than the East and West Wallabi Islands animals. The island tammars were <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a separate species from the mainland population. A 1991 examination of tammar skulls from different parts of the species' range found that populations can be divided into three distinct groups; one group made of populations from mainland Western Australia, East and West Wallabi Islands, Garden Island and Middle Island; a second group comprising populations from Flinders Island, 19th century mainland Southern Australia and New Zealand; and a third group consisting solely of the Kangaroo Island population. The Western Australia Department of Environment and Conservation listed these populations as subspecies; M. e. derbianus, M. e. eugenii and M. e. decres respectively.|$|E
5|$|South African cheetah (A. j. jubatus) (Schreber, 1775): Also {{called the}} Namibian cheetah. The {{nominate}} subspecies {{and the most}} numerous of the cheetahs. Occurs in southern African countries such as Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Mozambique and Zambia. Went extinct from Lesotho and southern Congo-Kinshasa. Introduced in the Hlane Royal National Park of Swaziland and reintroduced in the Liwonde National Park of Malawi. Separated from the Asiatic cheetah nearly 0.32–0.67 million years ago. In 2007 the population was roughly estimated at less than 5,000 to maximum 6,500 adult individuals. The South African cheetah populations are increasing in South Africa, Namibia and Botswana. <b>Once</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> extinct for 30 years, wild cheetahs were reported to persist Iona National Park in southwestern Angola {{for the first time}} in 2010.

5|$|The Iago sparrow was <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{most closely}} related to the rufous sparrows, a group of species within the genus Passer which live in similar {{habitats}} on continental Africa. Though the Iago sparrow is closest to the rufous sparrows in appearance, it has a number of crucial differences in morphology and behavior, and is separated by thousands of kilometres. It may in fact be more {{closely related to}} the house sparrow and Spanish sparrow. In Cape Verde it occurs on all but one island, and on most of them it is quite common. The Iago sparrow occurs in most habitats on available in its range, such as lava plains, rocky hills, and gorges; however, the house sparrow and Spanish sparrow are typically present instead in denser settlements and richer cultivated areas respectively. Because the Iago sparrow is not under any serious threats, it is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} {{is derived from}} neural crest cells, which come from the {{ectoderm}} layer of the embryo. These cells migrate from their initial position and aggregate {{in the vicinity of}} the dorsal aorta, a primitive blood vessel, which activates the differentiation of these cells through the release of proteins known as BMPs. These cells then undergo a second migration from the dorsal aorta to form the adrenal medulla and other organs of the sympathetic nervous system. Cells of the adrenal medulla are called chromaffin cells because they contain granules that stain with chromium salts, a characteristic not present in all sympathetic organs. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex were <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> responsible for the differentiation of chromaffin cells. More recent research suggests that BMP-4 secreted in adrenal tissue is the main responsible for this, and that glucocorticoids only play a role in the subsequent development of the cells.|$|E
5|$|The large groove {{that runs}} {{the length of the}} spine was <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a channel for blood vessels, but since the bone does not contain {{vascular}} canals, the sail is not thought to have been as highly vascularized as once thought. Some specimens of Dimetrodon preserve deformed areas of the neural spines that appear to be healed-over fractures. The cortical bone that grew over these breaks is highly vascularized, suggesting that soft tissue must have been present on the sail to supply the site with blood vessels. Layered lamellar bone makes up most of the neural spine's cross-sectional area, and contains lines of arrested growth {{that can be used to}} determine the age of each individual at death. In many specimens of D. gigashomogenes the distal portions of spines bend sharply, indicating that the sail would have had an irregular profile in life. Their crookedness suggests that soft tissue may not have extended all the way to the tips of the spines, meaning that the sail's webbing may not have been as extensive as it is commonly imagined.|$|E

5|$|Zeta Persei is the third-brightest {{star in the}} {{constellation}} at magnitude 2.86. Around 750 light-years from Earth, it is a blue-white supergiant 26–27 times the radius of the Sun and 47,000 times its luminosity. It is the brightest star (as seen from Earth) of a moving group of bright blue-white giant and supergiant stars, the Perseus OB2 Association or Zeta Persei Association. Zeta is a triple star system, with a companion blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B8 and apparent magnitude 9.16 around 3900 AU distant from the primary, and a white main sequence star of magnitude 9.90 and spectral type A2, some 50,000 AU away, {{that may or may}} not be gravitationally bound to the other two. X Persei is a double system in this association; one component is a hot, bright star and the other is a neutron star. With an apparent magnitude of 6.72, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye even in perfectly dark conditions. The system is an X-ray source and the primary star appears to be undergoing substantial mass loss. <b>Once</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a member of the Perseus OB2 Association, Omicron Persei is a multiple star system with a combined visual magnitude of 3.85. It is composed of two blue-white starsa giant of spectral class B1.5 and main sequence star of B3which orbit each other every 4.5 days and are distorted into ovoids due to their small separation. The system has a third star about which little is known. At an estimated distance of 1475 light-years from Earth, the system is now thought to lie too far from the center of the Zeta Persei group to belong to it.|$|E
