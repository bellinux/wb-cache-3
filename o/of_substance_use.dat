25|$|Benzodiazepine {{dependence}} or benzodiazepine {{addiction is}} when one has developed {{one or more}} of either tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, drug seeking behaviors, such as continued use despite harmful effects, and maladaptive pattern <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use,</b> according to the DSM-IV. In the case of benzodiazepine dependence, however, the continued use seems {{to be associated with the}} avoidance of unpleasant withdrawal reaction rather than from the pleasurable effects of the drug. Benzodiazepine dependence develops with long-term use, even at low therapeutic doses, without the described dependence behavior.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the mentioned health risks (like unwanted pregnancies and infection transmissions), other risks {{have been associated with}} early sexual activity. For example, a recent study (2017) found that those who start having sex at an earlier age have higher risks of: not using a condom; not having good memories of that first experience; and having had that relationship for non-autonomous reasons (such as partner pressure, peer pressure or the influence <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use).</b> This article also summarizes other risks (found in previous studies) associated with earlier sex: having an increased number of sexual partners or of casual sexual partners; perpetrating or being a victim of forced sex; engaging in paid sex; depression and behavior problems.|$|E
25|$|Prospective {{epidemiological}} studies {{do not support}} the hypotheses that comorbidity <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> disorders with other psychiatric illnesses is primarily a consequence of substance abuse or dependence or that increasing comorbidity is largely attributable to increasing use of substances. Yet emphasis is often on the effects of substances on the brain creating the impression that dual disorders are a natural consequence of these substances. However addictive drugs or exposure to gambling will not lead to addictive behaviors or drug dependence in most individuals but only in vulnerable ones, although, according to some researchers, neuroadaptation or regulation of neuronal plasticity, and molecular changes, may alter gene expression in some cases and subsequently lead to substance use disorders.|$|E

25|$|The {{initiation}} of {{drug and alcohol}} use is most likely to occur during adolescence, and some experimentation with substances by older adolescents is common. For example, results from 2010 Monitoring the Future survey, a nationwide study on rates <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> in the United States, show that 48.2% of 12th graders report having used an illicit drug {{at some point in their}} lives. In the 30 days prior to the survey, 41.2% of 12th graders had consumed alcohol and 19.2% of 12th graders had smoked tobacco cigarettes. In 2009 in the United States about 21% of high school students have taken prescription drugs without a prescription. And earlier in 2002, the World Health Organization estimated that around 140 million people were alcohol dependent and another 400 million with alcohol-related problems.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between negative affect {{and substance use}} disorders {{has been the most}} widely studied model of addiction. It proposes that individuals who experience the greatest levels of negative affect are at the greatest risk of using substances or behaviours as a coping (psychology) mechanism. Here, substances and behaviours are used to improve mood and distract from unpleasant feelings. Once physical dependence has been established, substance abuse is primarily motivated by a desire to avoid negative affective states associated with withdrawal. Individuals high in affective mood disorders (anxiety) most commonly report high levels of negative affect associated with cravings. The {{relationship between}} negative affect and addiction is not unidirectional. That is, while positive affect increases the likelihood of initiation <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use,</b> the negative affective states produced by withdrawal are the most commonly reported factors for continued use.|$|E
25|$|Current {{models of}} ADHD {{suggest that it}} is {{associated}} with functional impairments in some of the brain's neurotransmitter systems, particularly those involving dopamine and norepinephrine. Psychostimulants like methylphenidate and amphetamine may be effective in treating ADHD because they increase neurotransmitter activity in these systems. Approximately70% of those who use these stimulants see improvements in ADHD symptoms. Children with ADHD who use stimulant medications generally have better relationships with peers and family members, generally perform better in school, are less distractible and impulsive, and have longer attention spans. People with ADHD have an increased risk <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> disorders, and stimulant medications reduce this risk. Some studies suggest that since ADHD diagnosis is increasing significantly around the world, using the drug may cause more harm than good in some populations with ADHD. This applies to people who potentially may be experiencing a different issue and are misdiagnosed with ADHD. The drug is used to treat symptoms that could be better treated through a different, such as behavioural, intervention. People in this category can then experience negative side-effects of the drug which worsen their condition, and make it harder for them to receive adequate care as providers around them may believe the drugs are sufficient and the problem lies with the user.|$|E

2500|$|Research has {{consistently}} shown strong associations between affective disorders {{and substance use}} disorders. Specifically, people with mood disorders {{are at increased risk}} <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> disorders. Affect and addiction can be related {{in a variety of ways}} as they play a crucial role in influencing motivated behaviours. For instance, affect facilitates action, directs attention, prepares the individual for a physical response, and guides behaviour to meet particular needs. [...] Moreover, affect is implicated in a range of concepts relevant to addiction: positive reinforcement, behaviour motivation, regulation of cognition and mood, and reasoning and decision making. [...] Emotion-motivated reasoning has been shown to influence addictive behaviours via selecting outcomes that minimize negative affective states while maximizing positive affective states.|$|E

2500|$|A {{spectrum}} of drug use, {{drug abuse and}} substance dependence. One {{spectrum of}} this type, adopted by the Health Officers Council of British Columbia in 2005, does not employ loaded terms and distinctions such as [...] "use" [...] vs. [...] "abuse", but explicitly recognizes a spectrum ranging from potentially beneficial to chronic dependence (also known as addiction). The model includes the role not just of the individual but of society, culture and availability of substances. In concert with the identified spectrum of drug use, a spectrum of policy approaches was identified which depended partly on whether the drug in question was available in a legal, for-profit commercial economy, or at the other of the spectrum only in a criminal/prohibition, black-market economy. In addition, a standardized questionnaire has been developed in psychiatry based on a spectrum concept <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Unlike ADHD, which {{significantly}} {{increases the}} risk <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> disorder, autism spectrum disorder has the opposite effect of significantly {{reducing the risk of}} substance abuse. This is because introversion, inhibition and lack of sensation seeking personality traits, which are typical of autism spectrum disorder, protect against substance abuse and thus substance abuse levels are low in individuals who are on the [...] autism spectrum. However, certain forms of substance abuse, especially alcohol abuse, can cause or worsen certain neuropsychological symptoms which are common to autism spectrum disorder, such as impaired social skills due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain. The social skills that are impaired by alcohol abuse include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, prosody perception problems and theory of mind deficits; the ability to understand humour is also impaired in alcohol abusers.|$|E
2500|$|An {{additional}} cognitively-based {{model of}} substance abuse recovery has been offered by Aaron Beck, the father of cognitive therapy and championed in his 1993 book [...] Cognitive Therapy of Substance Abuse. This therapy rests upon the assumption addicted individuals possess core beliefs, often not accessible to immediate consciousness (unless the patient is also depressed). These core beliefs, such as [...] "I am undesirable," [...] activate a system of addictive beliefs that result in imagined anticipatory benefits <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> and, consequentially, craving. Once craving has been activated, permissive beliefs ("I can handle getting high just this one more time") are facilitated. Once a permissive set of beliefs have been activated, then the individual will activate drug-seeking and drug-ingesting behaviors. The cognitive therapist's job is to uncover this underlying system of beliefs, analyze it with the patient, and thereby demonstrate its dysfunctionality. As with any cognitive-behavioral therapy, homework assignments and behavioral exercises serve to solidify what is learned and discussed during treatment.|$|E

The study investigated the relationship between engagement with child health services and child protection outcomes for children <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> <b>using</b> mothers. [...] - [...] - Methods: A sample of 119 children of mothers who disclosed opiate, amphetamine or methadone use during a maternity admission between 2000 and 2003, as included in a previous matched co-hort study 1, were included in the current study. Statutory child protection agency and child health engagement information for {{the first two years of}} life, was obtained. The relationship between type <b>of</b> maternal <b>substance</b> <b>use,</b> child health engagement and child protection outcomes was examined. [...] - [...] - Results: Seventy two percent of study group infants were engaged with child health services during the first two years of life. Chi square analysis showed no significant relationship between child health engagement and child protection reports. Child health engagement was associated with decreased substantiated child protection notifications for children of methadone using mothers, but not for children <b>of</b> illicit <b>substance</b> users. [...] - [...] - Conclusions: Almost a quarter of identified children <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> <b>using</b> mothers are not accessing standard child health services in their first two years of life. This study provides support for increased attention to the provision of child health services for children of methadone using mothers.

2500|$|Due to a {{wide range}} of media {{coverage}} and large scale steroid scandals fans and experts have continued to bring the games integrity into question. Major League Baseball is a game of statistics. The entirety of a player's career is based upon the consistency and credibility of the numbers and accolades acquired during the period in which they played. [...] "Their real impact has been at the margins: There are certainly some scrubs who wouldn't be in the majors without the juice, and we have ample evidence that at the other end of the scale, drugs can take Hall of Famers and all-time greats and help them perform at historically unprecedented levels" [...] (La-Times). When it comes to this topic generally there are two trains of thought. Many do not see the harm with this type <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> because it makes the game more exciting and allows athletes to reach untested potentials. On the other side of the argument many fans and experts believe the game has lost its purity because of this drug use. More recently an issue has arose with high-caliber players who have tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs are not being voted for on a hall of fame ballot. This fact has brought many to question the game's integrity. No matter the statistics and achievements produced by the certain player prior to drug use, a positive test for steroids has shown to discredit the athletes integrity and career entirely.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Among the {{psychological}} difficulties seen in children <b>of</b> parents with <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> problems, the anxiety disorders {{are among the}} most chronic conditions. Although children of alcoholic parents often struggle with the effects <b>of</b> parental <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> problems long into adulthood, empirical investigations of the influence <b>of</b> parental <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> disorders on the course of anxiety disorders in adult offspring are rare. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine prospectively the relationship between parental <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> disorders and the course of anxiety disorders in adulthood over the course of 12 years. Methods Data on 618 subjects were derived from the Harvard/Brown Anxiety Research Project (HARP), a longitudinal naturalistic investigation of the clinical course of multiple anxiety disorders. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were used to calculate probabilities of time to anxiety disorder remission and relapse. Proportional hazards regressions were conducted to determine whether the likelihood of remission and relapse for specific anxiety disorders was lower for those who had a history <b>of</b> parental <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> disorders than for individuals without this parental history. Results Adults with a history <b>of</b> parental <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> disorders were significantly more likely to be divorced and to have a high school level of education. History <b>of</b> parental <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> disorder was a significant predictor of relapse of social phobia and panic disorders. Conclusion These findings provide compelling evidence that adult children <b>of</b> parents with <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> disorders are more likely to have relapses of social phobia and panic disorders. Clinicians who treat adults with anxiety disorders should assess parental <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> disorders and dependence histories. Such information may facilitate treatment planning with regards to their patients' level of vulnerability to perceive scrutiny by others in social situations, and ability to maintain a long-term panic-free state. </p...|$|R
