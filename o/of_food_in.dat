5|$|A {{sedentary}} ambush predator, the Pacific angelshark feeds {{mainly on}} bony fishes, including kelp bass, croakers, flatfishes, damselfishes, mackerels, and sardines. During {{the winter and}} early spring, spawning squid are abundant and become the primary source <b>of</b> <b>food.</b> <b>In</b> the southern Gulf of California, the most important prey species are, in descending order, the mackerel Decapterus macrosoma, the toadfish Porichthys analis, the lizardfish Synodus evermann, the soldierfish Myripristis leiognathus, and the shrimp Sicyonia penicillata. At Catalina Island, this species feeds mainly on the blacksmith (Chromis punctipinnis) and the queenfish (Seriphus politus). Adults and juveniles have similar diets.|$|E

5|$|In Grenada, the island's {{governor}} {{issued an}} emergency order against the hoarding <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>in</b> {{the aftermath of}} Janet, due to the food and water shortage that resulted from Janet. A United States destroyer and a British frigate were sent to bring relief supplies to Grenada, and ships departing from Jamaica and Trinidad were redirected to the island to help send supplies. The British government later {{announced that it would}} send £50,000 (US$155,000) in relief to the Grenadines. The Crown Agents and Red Cross delivered relief supplies to Barbados and the Grenadines, which included aluminum roofing sheets and portable electric generators.|$|E

5|$|The {{blackbuck}} has {{associations with}} the Indian culture. The antelope {{might have been}} a source <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>in</b> the Indus Valley civilisation (33001700 BCE); bone remains have been discovered in sites such as Dholavira and Mehrgarh. The blackbuck is routinely depicted in miniature paintings of the Mughal era (16th to 19th centuries) depicting royal hunts often using cheetahs. Villagers in India and Nepal generally do not harm the blackbuck. Tribes such as the Bishnois revere and care for most animals including the blackbuck. The blackbuck has been declared as the state animal of Andhra Pradesh.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} is diurnal. It has {{a period of}} {{foraging}} and eating in the morning, starting {{about an hour before}} sunrise, then rests or sleeps in mid-day. Foraging resumes for a few hours in the afternoon and subsides before sunset, and a third foraging period may occur around midnight. Females with pups appear to be more inclined to feed at night. Observations of the amount of time a sea otter must spend each day foraging range from 24 to 60%, apparently depending on the availability <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>in</b> the area.|$|E
5|$|These {{developments}} {{placed the}} regency in considerable difficulties. In spite of Apokaukos' adroit {{management of the}} state's finances, the devastation caused by the prolonged wars had emptied the treasury. In August 1343, Empress Anna was forced to pawn the crown jewels to Venice for 30,000 ducats. In addition, Turkish ravages in Thrace led to a scarcity <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>in</b> Constantinople. Hoping for Western aid, Anna appealed to the Pope, promising the submission of herself, John V, Apokaukos and even the Patriarch to his authority, and began persecuting the pro-Kantakouzenists and anti-Western Palamists.|$|E

5|$|An embargo is not {{the same}} as Food Power, however, food power can be used in an embargo. In fact, embargoes that do not involve food in their list of {{restricted}} items often fail. For example, on August 20, 1914 the Allied Powers began an embargo on important items that were normally shipped to Germany. However, the embargo was not complete nor effective until food was added to the list of restricted materials. Food has the real power. After food was introduced the blockade began to strangle Germany's economy because they were dependent on imports for food. Because the Allied Powers used the power <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>in</b> their embargo, Germany was forced to resort to desperate measures and eventually failed despite them.|$|E
5|$|Frying food {{in olive}} oil is attested in Classical Greece from about the 5th century BCE. The late Roman {{cookbook}} of Apicius (c. 400), appears to list the ancient Romans' first use of deep frying to prepare Pullum Frontonianum, a chicken dish. The practice of deep frying spread {{to other parts of}} Europe and Arabia in the following centuries. Deep-fried foods such as funnel cakes arrived in northern Europe by the 13th century, and deep-fried fish recipes have been found in cookbooks in Spain and Portugal at around the same time. Falafel arrived in the Middle East from population migrations from Egypt as soon as the 14th century. The deep frying <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>in</b> Japan was likely introduced by Portuguese the 16th century. Evidence of potato frying can be found as early as the late 17th century in Europe.|$|E
5|$|In a {{long-lived}} {{bird with}} a small clutch size such as the Atlantic puffin, the survival rate of adults {{is an important factor}} influencing the success of the species. Only 5% of the ringed puffins that failed to reappear at the colony did so during the breeding season. The rest were lost some time between departing from land in the summer and reappearing the following spring. The birds spend the winter widely spread out in the open ocean, though there is a tendency for individuals from different colonies to overwinter in different areas. Little is known of their behaviour and diet at sea but no correlation was found between environmental factors, such as temperature variations, and their mortality rate. A combination of the availability <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>in</b> winter and summer probably influences the survival of the birds, since individuals starting the winter in poor condition are less likely to survive than those in good condition.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} after the storm, the hardest hit {{residents}} faced food shortages and lacked access to clean water, in an area already facing ongoing food shortages. In response, the World Food Programme and other agencies of the United Nations created a program to feed about 350,000people in the region over three months, providing about 5,900tons <b>of</b> <b>food.</b> <b>In</b> the months after the storm, roads were repaired, including the link from Vangaindrano to Midongy. Farmers grew additional beans and potatoes {{to compensate for the}} damaged crops, while the quick distribution of food prevented significant malnutrition. In the subsequent years, about 40% of the forest at Manombo that regrew following Gretelle was of foreign nature, which threatened the original plants in the region.|$|E
5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of war in 1914 Norway declared its neutrality, alongside Sweden and Denmark. Nansen was appointed president of the Norwegian Union of Defence, but had few official duties, and continued with his professional work as far as circumstances permitted. As the war progressed, the loss of Norway's overseas trade led to acute shortages <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>in</b> the country, which became critical in April 1917 when the United States entered the war and placed extra restrictions on international trade. Nansen was dispatched to Washington by the Norwegian government; after months of discussion he secured food and other supplies {{in return for the}} introduction of a rationing system. When his government hesitated over the deal, he signed the agreement on his own initiative.|$|E
5|$|The human {{esophagus}} has a {{mucous membrane}} {{consisting of a}} tough stratified squamous epithelium without keratin, a smooth lamina propria, and a muscularis mucosae. The epithelium of the esophagus has a relatively rapid turnover, and serves a protective function against the abrasive effects <b>of</b> <b>food.</b> <b>In</b> many animals the epithelium contains a layer of keratin, representing a coarser diet. There {{are two types of}} glands, with mucus-secreting esophageal glands being found in the submucosa, and esophageal cardiac glands, similar to cardiac glands of the stomach, located in the lamina propria and most frequent in the terminal part of the organ. The mucus from the glands gives a good protection to the lining. The submucosa also contains the submucosal plexus, a network of nerve cells {{that is part of the}} enteric nervous system.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of Accum's publications {{were written in}} English. They were executed in a style that made them quite accessible to the common man. Many scientific contributions were brought forth through his writings, which were influential in the popularization of chemistry during this era. In 1820, Accum published Treatise on Adulteration <b>of</b> <b>Food,</b> <b>in</b> which he denounced the use of chemical additives to food. This ground-breaking work {{marked the beginning of}} an awareness of need for food safety oversight. Accum {{was the first person to}} tackle the subject and to reach a wide audience through his activities. His book, controversial at the time, found a wide audience and sold well. However, it threatened established practices within the food processing industry, earning him many enemies among the London food manufacturers. Accum left England after a lawsuit was brought against him. He lived out the rest of his life as a teacher at an industrial institution in Berlin.|$|E
5|$|The winter {{affected}} {{many other}} European countries. Similar cold periods and snowfalls {{were seen in}} much of Central Europe and the southern Baltic region. De Bilt, near Amsterdam in the Netherlands, experienced its worst winter since 1790. Because of the anticyclone {{to the north of}} the United Kingdom several incoming Atlantic depressions which would normally have hit Britain were forced south to the Mediterranean region, resulting in Portugal, Spain and Southern France having more rain than usual while remaining relatively warm. For example, the February rainfall at Gibraltar was , three times the average. As a result, France experienced both the extreme cold in the north, and much rain in the south. The winter caused 150 deaths from the cold and lack <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>in</b> Berlin, which was still recovering from its devastation during the final stages of the Second World War. It forced schools in the Netherlands to shut, led to a mob attack on a goods train carrying coal in Copenhagen, and caused the closure of businesses and the restriction of domestic gas supplies in the Republic of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} watch {{was issued}} for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands late on November15, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning six hours later. By that time, Lenny was projected to move over Puerto Rico. After Lenny made its closest {{approach to the}} island, the hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning on November17, which was discontinued the following day along with the advisories in the Virgin Islands. In Puerto Rico, the media maintained continuous coverage on the hurricane based on statements and warnings from the San Juan National Weather Service office. Based on the coverage, the public was well informed of the hurricane's threat to the island. Before the storm {{and as a result}} of its impact, around 4,700people evacuated to 191shelters. This included 1,190residents in Ponce who evacuated to 27schools, as well as 584people in western Puerto Rico. Officials closed all schools, banned the sale of alcohol, and ordered a freeze on the price of emergency supplies. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated six medical assistance teams, three medical support teams, and two advance medical assessment units. The agency stored five days' worth <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>in</b> schools in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Before the hurricane's arrival, U.S. Virgin Islands governor Charles Wesley Turnbull declared a state of emergency. In St. Croix, 309people rode out the storm in shelters. Officials opened eight shelters in the British Virgin Islands. There, airlines and hotels assisted in evacuating tourists from the area.|$|E
