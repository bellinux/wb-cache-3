Determination of CYP 2 D 6 <b>oxidation</b> <b>phenotype</b> is used to obtain more efficient phar-macotherapy and to explain lower efficacy of some drugs and presentation of adverse effects in particular patients. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the CYP 2 D 6 <b>oxidation</b> <b>phenotype</b> with dextromethorphan (DM) as a probe drug. The study included 85 healthy volunteers of Polish origin. DM (40 mg) was given orally to healthy adults and 10 -h urine samples were col-lected. DM and the metabolite dextrorphan (DX) were analyzed by the HPLC method. Phenotyping was performed using the meta-bolic ratio (MR) calculated as the urinary DM/DX output. Based on the metabolic ratio, we can distinguish extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers in human population. Individuals with a dextromethorphan MR greater than 0. 3 (log> – 0. 5) were classified as PMs. In our study, the frequency of the PM phenotype was 9. 4 %, which is in the range found in other Caucasian populations (3 – 10 %).

40|$|Perhexiline maleate is an {{antianginal}} agent which {{depends on}} hepatic oxidation for its elimination. Its use may be {{complicated by the}} development of peripheral neuropathy and liver damage. The majority of patients with perhexiline neuropathy have an impaired ability to effect metabolic drug oxidation which is genetically determined. Information has not been available on drug oxidation capacity in patients with perhexiline liver injury. Drug oxidation was measured using an <b>oxidation</b> <b>phenotyping</b> procedure in four patients with perhexiline liver injury and in 70 patients with chronic liver disease serving as a control group. All four patients with perhexiline liver damage showed a substantial metabolic defect; three of the four patients (75 %) showed a genetically determined impairment of oxidation capacity. The incidence of severely impaired oxidation capacity in the perhexiline group was significantly greater than in the patients with chronic liver disease (6 / 70; 8. 6 %) and in the healthy population (9 %) (F = 0. 0048). A clear association exists between perhexiline liver injury and diminished drug metabolic activity, suggesting that the propensity to develop perhexiline liver injury is, at least in part, genetically determined...|$|R
40|$|The {{metabolism}} of metoprolol was {{studied in}} 143 unselected hypertensive patients and in 10 families. The log 10 metoprolol to alpha-hydroxymetoprolol urinary ratio was bimodally distributed and {{was correlated with}} the debrisoquine <b>oxidation</b> <b>phenotype</b> (rs = 0. 81, P less than 0. 001). The results of the pedigree study were compatible with poor hydroxylation of metoprolol being inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The major urinary metabolite of metoprolol metabolism was H 117 - 04, the end-product of O-dealkylation. The distribution of the log 10 metoprolol to H 117 - 04 (M/H 117 - 04) urinary ratio was unimodal. However, {{there was a significant}} correlation between this ratio and the debrisoquine <b>oxidation</b> <b>phenotype</b> (rs = 0. 68, P less than 0. 001) and poor metabolisers of debrisoquine (PMs) were concentrated at {{the upper end of the}} range of M/H 117 - 04 values. These results indicate that both the alpha-hydroxylation and O-dealkylation of metoprolol are under polymorphic control of the debrisoquine type. Plasma concentrations of metoprolol were about three times higher in PMs than in extensive metabolisers of debrisoquine (EMs) at 3 h after dosing. In a sub-group of 24 subjects, all seven PMs but only two EMs showed more than a 10 % reduction in post-exercise heart rate at 24 h after dosing...|$|E

40|$|Eight healthy volunteers {{received}} oral metoprolol 200 mg once {{daily for}} a week. The AUC, half-life {{and duration of}} beta-adrenoceptor blockade on day 7 was much greater in two subjects than in the remaining six.

Subsequent testing of <b>oxidation</b> <b>phenotype</b> with oral debrisoquine showed that the subjects with high metoprolol availability were also poor hydroxylators of debrisoquine. The urinary debrisoquine/ 4 -hydroxydebrisoquine ratio was highly correlated with metoprolol AUC, half-life and beta-adrenoceptor blockade at 24 h.

40|$|METOPROLOL is {{a widely}} used beta-adrenoreceptor an-tagonist. To our knowledge, there is no report of {{hepatitis}} involving this drug {{as well as other}} beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists (1). Metoprolol is metabolized by three ma-jor oxidation pathways (2); two of them, O-dealkylation and alpha-hydroxylation, undergo genetically controlled polymorphisms correlated with that of debrisoquine oxi-dation (2 - 4). This finding strongly suggests that meto-prolol oxidation depends at least partly on the same iso-zyme of cytochrome P- 450 involved in the genetic polymorphism of oxidation of debrisoquine and many other drugs such as sparteine, perhexiline, and several other beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists (5). Poor metabo-lizers of debrisoquine and metoprolol exhibit abnormal pharmacokinetics of metoprolol, which can result in an overdose after the administration of a standard dose (3, 4). There is a clear association between impairment of debrisoquine oxidation and susceptibility to develop liver injury with perhexiline (6). It would be interesting to determine whether such an association exists for meto-prolol.

40|$|A {{combination}} of spectral and chromatographic analytical methods has been executed to monitor {{chemicals in the}} hair of Vietnamese people. Methods were developed for the determination of some chemical elements in hair by inductively coupled-plasma atomic emission spectroscopy with limits of detection reaching 1 - 100 μg · l － 1. A supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and clean-up procedures were established for isolating organochlorine pollutants (OCPs) and organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) from the hair of the Vietnamese test subjects. Eight OCPs and OPPs were determined by SFE with carbon dioxide only and methanol-modified carbon dioxide extraction at 350 bar and 45 ℃, followed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The results indicated that OCPs can be extracted quantitatively using CO 2 only, whereas OPPs require a modifier for extraction. The lim its of detection that were found were between 0. 7 to 1. 3 μg · g － 1, and good linearity (r 2 > 0. 9861) was achieved within the tested ranges. The activities of the N-acetyltransferase (NAT) and the monooxygenases cytochrome P 450 (CYP 450) were determined and compared to the acetylation and <b>oxidation</b> <b>phenotypes</b> of healthy Vietnamese test subjects.

40|$|The first {{molecular}} {{and genetic}} characterization of a biochemical pathway for oxidation of the reduced phosphorus (P) compounds phosphite and hypophosphite is reported. The pathway was identified in Pseudomonas stutzeri WM 88, which {{was chosen for}} detailed studies {{from a group of}} organisms isolated based on their ability to oxidize hypophosphite (+ 1 valence) and phosphite (+ 3 valence) to phosphate (+ 5 valence). The genes required for oxidation of both compounds by P. stutzeri WM 88 were cloned on a single ca. 30 -kbp DNA fragment by screening for expression in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Two lines of evidence suggest that hypophosphite is oxidized to phosphate via a phosphite intermediate. First, plasmid subclones that conferred oxidation of phosphite, but not hypophosphite, upon heterologous hosts were readily obtained. All plasmid subclones that failed to confer phosphite oxidation also failed to confer hypophosphite oxidation. No subclones that conferred only hypophosphite expression were obtained. Second, various deletion derivatives of the cloned genes were made in vitro and recombined onto the chromosome of P. stutzeri WM 88. Two phenotypes were displayed by individual mutants. Mutants with the region encoding phosphite oxidation deleted (based upon the subcloning results) lost the ability to oxidize either phosphite or hypophosphite. Mutants with the region encoding hypophosphite oxidation deleted lost only the ability to oxidize hypophosphite. The phenotypes displayed by these mutants also demonstrate that the cloned genes are responsible for the P <b>oxidation</b> <b>phenotypes</b> displayed by the original P. stutzeri WM 88 isolate. The DNA sequences of the minimal regions implicated in oxidation of each compound were determined. The region required for oxidation of phosphite to phosphate putatively encodes a binding-protein-dependent phosphite transporter, an NAD+-dependent phosphite dehydrogenase, and a transcriptional activator of the lysR family. The region required for oxidation of hypophosphite to phosphite putatively encodes a binding-protein-dependent hypophosphite transporter and an α-ketoglutarate-dependent hypophosphite dioxygenase. The finding of genes dedicated to oxidation of reduced P compounds provides further evidence that a redox cycle for P may be important in the metabolism of this essential, and often growth-limiting, nutrient...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{perhexiline}} maleate as an antianginal {{agent is}} occasionally associated with side effects, particularly neuropathy and liver damage. The reason why some individuals develop these toxic reactions is not clear, though some {{evidence suggests that}} they may result from impaired oxidative metabolism, due to genetic or hepatic factors, and consequential accumulation of the drug in toxic concentrations.

Most of the 20 patients with neuropathy, but not the unaffected patients, showed an impaired ability to effect metabolic drug oxidation. This impairment was independent of hepatic function, concurrent drug therapy, or tobacco or alcohol consumption. The fact {{that the ability to}} oxidise several drugs is genetically controlled points to a genetic susceptibility to developing neuropathy in response to perhexiline.

40|$|The {{ability to}} oxidize {{manganese}} {{is a potential}} virulence factor in fungal phytopathogenic interactions. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify and characterize the Mn oxidizing factor (MOF) produced by the ascomycete fungi, Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (Ggt) and Magnaporthe grisea, and to confirm the role of Mn oxidation in fungal virulence. Culture assays and spectrophotometric analysis of crude culture extracts derived from Ggt support the involvement of a multicopper oxidase such as laccase in Mn oxidation. The importance of laccase in the phytopathogenic fungal biology is supported by the identification of twelve putative laccase genes in the M. grisea genome, and the strong expression of a specific laccase, lcc 15, under Mn oxidizing conditions. Two genes with homology to Mn peroxidase were identified in M. grisea. Targeted deletion of these genes did not abolish Mn oxidation activity but resulted in mutants with distinct Mn oxidation phenotypes. Further, these mutants appeared to be reduced in virulence causing smaller lesions on susceptible rice line CO- 39 than wild-type isolates. The research presented herein suggests the participation of two separate enzymes, a multicopper oxidase and a peroxidase, in Mn oxidation by Ggt and M. grisea. Further, reduced virulence in M. grisea gene deletion mutants with an altered Mn <b>oxidation</b> <b>phenotype</b> supports the role of Mn oxidation in fungal virulence. ...|$|E

Hydrogen <b>oxidation</b> by Hup-hr <b>phenotype</b> USDA 61 in cowpea symbioses was significant because hydrogen evolution from nitrogen-fixing nodules was not detected. An examination for uptake hydrogenase activity in soybean and cowpea with 123 strains diverse in origin and serology identified 16 Hup+ and 28 Hup-hr phenotype strains; the remainder appeared to be Hup−. The Hup-hr phenotype was associated with serogroups 31, 76, and 94, while strains belonging to serogroups 6, 31, 110, 122, 123, and 38 / 115 were Hup+.

The presence of the uptake hydrogenase protein in cowpea bacteroids of Hup+ strains was demonstrated with immunoblot analyses by using antibodies against the 65 -kDa subunit of uptake hydrogenase purified from strain SR 470. However, the hydrogenase protein of Hup-hr strains was not detected. Results of Southern hybridization analyses with pHU 1 showed the region of DNA with hydrogenase genes among Hup+ strains to be similar.

Whole-genome array experiments were conducted to test for genes overexpressed in the triple-FDH mutant compared to the wild type, and a gene (fdh 4 A) was identified whose translated product carried similarity to an uncharacterized putative molybdopterin-binding oxidoreductase-like protein sharing relatively low similarity with known formate dehydrogenase alpha subunits. Mutation of this gene in the triple-FDH mutant background resulted in a methanol-negative phenotype. When the gene was deleted in the wild-type background, the mutant revealed diminished growth on methanol with accumulation of high levels of formate in the medium, pointing to an important role of FDH 4 in methanol metabolism. The identity of FDH 4 as a novel FDH was also confirmed by labeling experiments that revealed strongly reduced CO 2 formation in growing cultures.

40|$|Type- 2 {{diabetes}} (T 2 D), a multi-factorial disease characterised by chronic hyperglycaemia, {{is caused}} by a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Genetic and phenotypic characterisations of diabetic patients suggest that a combination of β-cell failure, culminating in defective insulin secretion, as well as impairment of glucagon secretion in α-cells is central to the aetiology of the disease. Mouse models represent a valuable tool in such investigations. With the advent of large-scale genetic tools, a myriad of novel susceptibility loci associated with T 2 D have been identified. For many of these genes, it is unclear how genetic variation is linked to increased disease susceptibility. Our first study elucidates the implication of a transcription factor, SOX 4, which is believed to underlie a T 2 D susceptibility locus (CDKAL 1) in human. Using an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mouse model, we explored β-cell function in mice carrying a point mutation in Sox 4 (Sox 4 mt mice). This mouse strain displayed a significant reduction in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) that was associated with a 2 -fold increase in wild-type Sox 4 expression. The exocytotic events in mutant β-cells, as measured by single-vesicle (on-cell) capacitance measurements, suggested the presence of a persistent fusion pore. Subsequent failure of fusion pore expansion beyond the initial 1 – 2 nm results in an incomplete insulin release due to steric hindrance (insulin diameter: 3 – 4 nm). The proportion of full fusion events diminished in favour of kiss-and-run events in mutant β-cells. Stxbp 6, which encodes amisyn, was shown to be the target gene of Sox 4. Increased expression of amisyn, a protein previously shown {{to be involved in the}} stabilisation of the fusion pore in chromaffin cells, was observed in islets isolated from Sox 4 mt mice. The possible involvement of amisyn is further suggested by the finding that overexpression of amisyn mimicked the effect of the Sox 4 mutation and resulted in reduced insulin secretion. Knockdown of amisyn expression restored the secretory defect in Sox 4 mt-overexpressing cells. Importantly, the effect of the Sox 4 mutation was recapitulated by the overexpression of Sox 4. Similar effects were obtained in the human β-cell line EndoC-βH 2. We also observed a negative correlation between SOX 4 expression and GSIS in a large collection of human islet preparations. There was also a positive correlation between SOX 4 expression and STXBP 6 (amisyn) expression and a tendency towards increased SOX 4 expression in islets from organ donors with T 2 D. The second part of the thesis focuses on the role of the Krebs cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase (FH) in insulin release. Ablation of the Fh 1 gene (which is initially implicated as a tumour suppressor in hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer) in pancreatic β-cells led to a complete loss of GSIS, as determined by ex vivo pancreatic perfusion studies, although this was not associated with any detectable abnormalities in [Ca 2 +] i homeostasis, ATP production or glucose <b>oxidation.</b> The <b>phenotype</b> was rescued by the introduction of the human orthologue FH into the cytosol alone or in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria of Fh 1 knockout (Fh 1 KO) mice, confirming the role of Fh 1 in insulin secretion. Moreover, the addition of exogenous glutamate, previously implicated as a 2 nd messenger between glucose metabolism and insulin secretion, corrected the insulin secretory defect in Fh 1 -/- β-cells. We hypothesise that the loss of GSIS in Fh 1 KO mice results from enhanced anaplerosis, which is necessary to replenish Krebs cycle reactants. Consequently, this is followed by the depletion of the intracellular amino acid pool (including glutamate). Thus, our study demonstrates that the pancreatic Fh 1 KO mouse is a novel model of severe hyperglycaemia that harbours dysregulated metabolic features at the interface between both cancer and diabetes. The final study investigates the effect of ageing, a risk factor for T 2 D, on glucose-stimulated insulin and glucagon release. However, GSIS increased rather than decreased with ageing in both human and mouse islets (6 and 20 mmol/l glucose). Notably, ageing was not associated with reduced insulin content. Normal calcium homeostasis was observed in old (24 -month-old) mice, demonstrating that the glucose sensing machinery was intact. In human islets, the inhibitory effect of glucose on glucagon secretion deteriorated with age. In the oldest group (> 60 years of age), the inhibitory effect was completely abolished with 20 mmol/l glucose, while 6 mmol/l glucose only achieved less than 20 % inhibition (which was not statistically significant). Our study reports the exciting possibility that hypersecretion of glucagon represents a link between senescence and increased diabetes risk. This thesis is not currently available in OR...|$|R
