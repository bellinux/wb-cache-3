40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2002 Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to examine {{the role of a}} person's self-esteem and group influences in their reactions to a perceived injustice. Study 1, conducted with a sample of undergraduate business students, indicates that individuals with high self-esteem and stable self-esteem are most likely to respond negatively to a perceived injustice. Study 2 was modified to include the influences of <b>one's</b> <b>group</b> members and how self-esteem interacts with these group influences. This study conducted with current MBA students, demonstrates that <b>one's</b> <b>group</b> can have a significant influence on the perceptions of injustice and one's subsequent reactions to these injustices. Self-esteem was found to not interact with <b>one's</b> <b>group</b> members to predict retaliation behavior...|$|R

5|$|A {{small group}} of reptiles, the diapsids, began to diversify during the Triassic, notably the dinosaurs. By the late Mesozoic, the large labyrinthodont groups that first {{appeared}} during the Paleozoic such as temnospondyls and reptile-like amphibians had gone extinct. All current major groups of sauropsids evolved during the Mesozoic, with birds first appearing in the Jurassic as a derived clade of theropod dinosaurs. Many groups of synapsids such as anomodonts and therocephalians that once comprised the dominant terrestrial fauna of the Permian also became extinct during the Mesozoic; during the Triassic, however, <b>one</b> <b>group</b> (Cynodontia) {{gave rise to the}} descendant taxon Mammalia, which survived through the Mesozoic to later diversify during the Cenozoic.|$|E

50|$|Group {{membership}} evaluation {{reflects the}} basic premise of social identity theory that individuals strive for favourable evaluations of their group. The more positively <b>one's</b> <b>group</b> is perceived, {{the greater the}} positive evaluations individuals can draw from when interpreting themselves. Having a negative sense of self as Māori has group members internalise the negative evaluations into their own self-concept. Since social identities are not only descriptive but also evaluative, the position of <b>one's</b> <b>group</b> within social hierarchy is viewed as central to the self-experience of individual members.|$|R
