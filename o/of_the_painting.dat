40|$|For the wall’s {{moisture}} state calculations {{it is important}} to know <b>the</b> values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water vapour permeability parameters for <b>the</b> materials <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> wall layers are made. Therefore, if <b>the</b> exterior layer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall is <b>painted</b> repeatedly then <b>the</b> vapour resistance value of total paint layers do not conform to the declared values. Hence <b>the</b> aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paper is to the determinate the correlation between <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> coating layers and water vapour resistance by presenting the linear regression equation that can be used to predict <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> coating’s vapour resistance factor in relation to <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> coating layers. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> calculation show, that <b>the</b> sd value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> coating depends on <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> and <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> coating layers n. <b>The</b> major inadequacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sd value is determined for <b>the</b> acrylic <b>paint...</b>|$|R

40|$|The article {{describes}} <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> ultrasonic vibrations to <b>the</b> preparation <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> before <b>the</b> coating process.

5000|$|Traditional oil {{painting}} techniques often {{begin with the}} artist sketching the subject onto the canvas with charcoal or thinned paint. Oil paint is usually mixed with linseed oil, artist grade mineral spirits, or other solvents to make <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> thinner, faster or slower-drying. (Because these solvents thin the oil in <b>the</b> <b>paint,</b> {{they can also be}} used to clean paint brushes.) A basic rule of oil paint application is 'fat over lean'. This means that each additional layer of paint should contain more oil than the layer below to allow proper drying. If each additional layer contains less oil, <b>the</b> final <b>painting</b> will crack and peel. This rule does not ensure permanence; it is the quality and type of oil that leads to a strong and stable paint film. There are many other media that can be used with the oil, including cold wax, resins, and varnishes. These additional media can aid the painter in adjusting <b>the</b> translucency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint,</b> <b>the</b> sheen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint,</b> <b>the</b> density or 'body' <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint,</b> and <b>the</b> ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> to hold or conceal the brushstroke. These aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> are closely related to <b>the</b> expressive capacity <b>of</b> oil paint.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{principle}} <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> strippers is penetration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> film by <b>the</b> molecules <b>of</b> <b>the</b> active ingredient, causing its swelling; {{this volume}} increase causes internal strains, which, together with <b>the</b> weakening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> layer's adhesion {{to the underlying}} surface, leads to separation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> layer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> from <b>the</b> substrate.|$|R
5|$|His The Round of the Prisoners (1890) {{was painted}} after an {{engraving}} by Gustave Doré (1832–1883). Tralbaut {{suggests that the}} face of the prisoner in the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> looking towards the viewer is Van Gogh himself; Jan Hulsker discounts this.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Manchester Art Gallery staff {{determined}} that if conservation work were not undertaken, the painting {{would soon be}} beyond repair. The Esmée Fairbairn Foundation and AXA Art Insurance provided funding for the restoration. A replacement canvas to which the painting had been attached in the 1930s was removed. Following this, a mixture of isinglass adhesive and chalk was used to restore the surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> and the paint added during the earlier attempted restoration was removed. A new double layer of canvas {{was added to the}} back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> and the three layers were glued together.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> main {{purposes}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diluent are {{to dissolve}} the polymer and adjust <b>the</b> viscosity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint.</b> It is volatile and does not become part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> film. It also controls flow and application properties, {{and in some cases}} can affect <b>the</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> while in liquid state. Its main function is as the carrier for the non volatile components. To spread heavier oils (for example, linseed) as in oil-based interior house paint, a thinner oil is required. These volatile substances impart their properties temporarily—once the solvent has evaporated, <b>the</b> remaining <b>paint</b> is fixed to the surface.|$|R

5|$|A Polish Nobleman is a 1637 {{painting}} by Rembrandt depicting {{a man in}} a costume of either Polish szlachta or boyar nobility. The identity of the subject <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> is unclear, and has given rise to several different interpretations. The view that the figure's dress is clearly Polish is not universally held and {{it may have been a}} self-portrait.|$|E
5|$|A book {{published}} by Nationalmuseum in 1992 on Carl Larsson {{claims that the}} most immediate and natural explanation for the ultimate rejection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> {{was the fact that}} time had rendered the painting unfashionable. Because of the long debate, the painting became a survivor from a time past and it could not meet the modernist ideals of the new century.|$|E
5|$|A fierce sky {{caught in}} the {{dichotomy}} between the setting sun and the crescent moon dominates {{more than a third}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b> The rain-heavy clouds swirling ominously around each celestial entity are separated by a gulf of calmness, intensifying the contrast and infusing the heavens with an unearthly glow. Light from the sky spills onto the landscape: while the western continent and the Nile are bathed in the sun's light, the east and the Tower of Babel are cloaked in shadow.|$|E

5|$|After the discovery, Libby Sheldon of University College London {{conducted}} several {{tests to}} verify the painting's age, including spectroscopy and laser microscopy. The age of the inscription was taken into consideration, and found to be contemporaneous with the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b> Pigments, including a type of yellow pigment rarely found after 1600, were appropriate for the 16th century. Dendrochronological analysis later showed that the work {{was too late to}} be a life portrait of Jane, but did not rule out the possibility of reproduction.|$|E
5|$|As cheap {{reproductions of}} Hope, and from 1908 {{high-quality}} prints, began to circulate in large quantities, {{it became a}} widely popular image. President Theodore Roosevelt displayed a copy at his Sagamore Hill home in New York; reproductions circulated worldwide; and a 1922 film depicted Watts's creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> and an imagined story behind it. By this time Hope was coming to seem outdated and sentimental, and Watts was rapidly falling out of fashion. In 1938 the Tate Gallery ceased to keep their collection of Watts's works on permanent display.|$|E
5|$|Beyond is the Mediterranean Sea and {{the island}} of Cyprus.

The Nile River meanders in the far distance, emptying its seven arms into the Mediterranean at the Nile Delta. South of Cyprus is the Sinai Peninsula, which forms a land bridge between Africa and Southwest Asia. The Red Sea lies beyond, eventually merging – as the mountain ranges to its left and right do – with the curved horizon.|$|E
