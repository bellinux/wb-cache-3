50|$|A {{sales order}} is an {{internal}} document of the company, meaning it {{is generated by}} the company itself. A sales order should record the customer's originating purchase order which is an external document.

A sales order, being an internal document, can therefore contain many customer purchase orders under it. In a manufacturing environment, a sales order can be converted into a work order to show that work is about to begin to manufacture, build or engineer the products the customer wants.|$|E
50|$|Fuller had an occultist {{side that}} oddly mixed with his {{military}} side. He {{was an early}} disciple of English poet and magician Aleister Crowley, and was very familiar with his {{and other forms of}} magick and mysticism. While serving in the First Oxfordshire Light Infantry he had entered and won a contest to write the best review of Crowley's poetic works, after which it turned out that he was the only entrant. This essay was later published in book form in 1907 as The Star in the West. After this he became an enthusiastic supporter of Crowley, joining his magical order, the A∴A∴., within which he became a leading member, editing <b>order</b> <b>documents</b> and its journal, The Equinox. During this period he wrote The Treasure House of Images, edited early sections of Crowley's magical autobiography The Temple of Solomon the King and produced highly regarded paintings dealing with A∴A∴ teachings: these paintings have been used in recent years as the covers of the journal's revival, The Equinox, Volume IV.|$|E

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to use machine learning to <b>order</b> <b>documents</b> by popular-ity, or the predicted frequency that an article is viewed by the average PubMed user. Other research on general search en-gine usability has applied machine learning to <b>order</b> <b>documents</b> by their relevance to a given query. The approach here takes a global view of popularity across all users in a given time period, independent of their information need. An effec-tive method for learning popularity from clickthrough data is identified, and a novel measure of success in this task is pro-posed. The resulting model shows that the topic of an article has the largest single influence on its popularity, and its pub-lication date has a strong secondary influence. Possible applications and extensions are discussed...|$|E
