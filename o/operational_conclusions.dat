There has been a general consensus in favour of an improved methodology for the protection and management of cultural heritage and of the need {{to move away from the}} ideology of the past towards a more inclusive and integrated approach, recognising the value of heritage in society. The concept of sustainable development and the contribution of the heritage in this sphere is a new field of consideration - in its early stages in terms of understanding and implementation, but this should not deter investigation of sustainable solutions. The debate has made a major contribution to the reform process. There is a need for a functioning network and capacity building to exchange ideas to further assist this process. The Council of Europe will undertake to organise, with different host countries, a programme of activities drawn from the requests of country delegates and the <b>operational</b> <b>conclusions</b> of this examination. The issues for susequent consideration will be based on the following subject areas, for which a number of themes have been provisionally identified: - the use of digital information systems; - cultural landscapes; - integrated consevation systems; - cultural heritage and sustainable development; - financial policy and funding measures including revitalisation programmes, the use of the heritage as an economic resource and the perspective of investors; - human resources for the management of cultural heritage...|$|E

The hypothesis {{to be tested}} is that changes {{in the level of}} spatial aggregation of the data produce significant differences in the values of some basic descriptive statistics, and hence in <b>operational</b> <b>conclusions.</b> The paper shows that population density works as a proxy for structural factors that may be difficult to change by policies and that working with 264 regions confirms the north-south divergences in terms of road safety in Europe but also stresses the local or regional differences due to political, geographical, economic, environmental and statistical disparities. Safe countries include unsafe regions, and there are safe regions in unsafe countries. Decision makers should be aware of this when comparing countries.

40|$|Information {{systems in}} the dairy herd are used for planning, management, follow-up, and control. Herd data analysis, is a {{continuously}} evolving process, in which {{we need to address}} the following questions: a. Diagnosis and alert (what happens?); b. Retrospective monitoring (what happened?); c. Retrospective evaluation of causality and economic losses (Why did it happen? What were the losses in production and fertility? What were the economical losses?); d. The quality of data; e. From manual observation to automation; and f. Prediction abilities (what will happen?). Veterinary medicine had traditionally centered on individual animals. Emerging new problems, being mostly multifactorial and multidisciplinary, called for integrated programs for herd health (Markusfeld-Nir, 1996). To cross the line from individual to herd medicine, data should be recorded and processed, so that both statistical and epidemiological evaluations can be carried out. Herd health monitoring is done on populations, not on individuals. Yet, individual cow data are essential if interactions between factors are to be clarified. Achieving optimal cow performance by drawing <b>operational</b> <b>conclusions</b> from data is the ultimate aim of such a program. Figure 1 describes the relevant data that is processed and the reports that are issued and evaluated. The reports include both monitoring and causal analysis. MONITORING REPORTS Ongoing monitoring of herd performance is compared to pre-set targets of performance.

40|$|There {{remains a}} lack of {{information}} on the future of plant species in many parts of Africa under the threads of climate change {{with the exception of the}} mountainous areas. Models are valuables tools to examine this problem because they permit to extrapolate basic information as simple as species occurrence coming from a restricted number of localities to the entire continent. Niche-based models, like logistic regression or MaxEnt, easily allow fitting empirical relationships between environmental variables related to climate and possibly to soil properties. They produce probabilities of occurrence for the present with good accuracy (calibration phase). Projections for the future are made by switching the explanatory data set with future conditions. These models however are limited by the fact that it is difficult to integrate physiological response to increasing CO 2 air concentration. Dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) are process-based models that simulate plant environment (soil water, light intensity at various heights, etc.) and plant physiology (transpiration, CO 2 fixation, photosynthesis, respiration, carbon allocation, etc.) from climate variables, soil properties, and elevation. They could be run at various scales, from global to regional or even local scale, and simulate the growth of plant functional types (PFTs), of biological affinity groups (BAGs) or of species. A model like CARAIB is able to simulate PFTs and BAGs growth (occurrence and productivity) with rather good accuracy for Western Europe. For the future, the simulations confirm that the physiological effect of CO 2 concentration change is dramatic but not easily foreseeable because it depends on overall fertility of the sites (Dury et al., iForest – Biogeosciences and Forestry, 4 : 82 - 99, 2011). From this conclusion, spatial and temporal variations of fertility would have to be introduced in modelling studies to reach more <b>operational</b> <b>conclusions.</b> Questions arising about the future of ecosystem services in tropical countries highlight particular plant species (BIOSERF project funded by the Belgian Science Policy: Sustainability of tropical forest biodiversity and services under climate and human pressure). In this study, we model a set of 11 selected African tree species including several Congolese species with logistic regression, MaxEnt and CARAIB models. The two niche-based-models rather properly simulate the ranges obtained with the alpha-hull polygon method. CARAIB correctly simulates the range of the evergreen species but not of the deciduous trees. We examine how physiological knowledge could be use to improve the model. IN particular, we conclude that bud dormancy breaking representation has to be upgraded in the model because this process is likely to control the range of the species. It should act in combination with the specific bioclimatic constants controlling the hydrological and thermal stress and the germination. Additionally, we examine the evolution of the ranges at the 2050 horizon using one of the most recent socio-economic scenarios...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} repeatability and stability of capnography interfaced with human exposure facility. Methods Capnographic wave signals were obtained from five healthy volunteers exposed to particle-free, filtered air during two consecutive 5 min intervals, 10 min apart, within the open and then the sealed and operational human exposure facility (HEF). Using a customized setup comprised of the Oridion Microcap ® portable capnograph, DA converter and AD card, the signal was acquired and saved as an ASCII file for subsequent processing. The minute ventilation (VE), respiratory rate (RR) and expiratory tidal volume (V TE) were recorded before and after capnographic recording and then averaged. Each capnographic tracing was analyzed for acceptable waves. From each recorded interval, 8 to 19 acceptable waves were selected and measured. The following wave parameters were obtained: total length and length of phase II and III, slope of phase II and III, area under the curve and area under phase III. In addition, we recorded signal measures including the mean, standard deviation, mode, minimum, maximum – which equals end-tidal CO 2 (EtCO 2), zero-corrected maximum and true RMS. Results Statistical analysis using a paired t-test for means showed no statistically significant changes of any wave parameters and wave signal measures, corrected for RR and V TE, comparing the measures when the HEF was open vs. sealed and operational. The coefficients of variation of the zero-corrected and uncorrected EtCO 2, phase II absolute difference, signal mean, standard deviation and RMS were less than 10 % despite a sub-atmospheric barometric pressure, and slightly higher temperature and relative humidity within the HEF when <b>operational.</b> <b>Conclusion</b> We showed that a customized setup for the acquisition and processing of the capnographic wave signal, interfaced with HEF was stable and repeatable. Thus, we expect that analysis of capnographic waves in controlled human air pollution exposure studies is a feasible tool for characterization of cardio-pulmonary effects of such exposures. </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIt is {{currently}} stated and widely accepted by industry and users that the RAIM {{is designed to}} provide timely warnings in the situation where only one of the range measurements used at the current epoch is affected by an unacceptable bias. However, given the range of potential applications of RAIM in the future, in particular with the advent of Galileo and the generalization of Safety of Life applications, which should spread from the civil aviation community to many other professional sectors, {{it is very important to}} better understand the fundamental properties of RAIM, and in particular the potential of RAIM to detect multiple failures on range measurements. The purpose of the study presented in this paper is to analyze the performance of a RAIM in the presence of multiple simultaneous range errors. In particular, we conduct a theoretical analysis to determine in which cases the Least Squares Residuals RAIM detection criterion is not affected, and analyzed results of Monte-Carlo simulations in presence of up to four range failures. The theoretical analysis outlined above aims at determining in what conditions the Least Squares Residuals RAIM detection criterion remains unaffected by multiple range failures, searching for what we call criterion unaffecting range errors. We show that, provided the satellite constellation does not have any degenerated geometrical properties, the dimension of the vector sub-space of these criterion unaffecting errors is max(4 -(N-p), 0), where N is the number of tracked satellites and p is the number of faulty pseudorange measurements. The immediate conclusion is that if N- 4 pseudo range measurements are affected, or less than that, by a large error, there exists no error that will not affect the RAIM detection criterion, and globally due to the negligible probability that unintentional interference lies in a small dimension sub-space, the RAIM detection criterion exhibits a natural detection capability even if up to N- 2 pseudo-range measurements are faulty. This theoretical result defines the properties of the errors that lead to zero change in the detection criterion. To jump to a more <b>operational</b> <b>conclusion,</b> it remains to know what the possibility is for multiple range errors to induce a detection criterion that is below the detection threshold. So to complement the theoretical analysis outlined above, we ran Monte Carlo simulations inserting up to four range failures and analyzing the detection capacity. The capacity of RAIM detection is also analyzed in the presence of intentional jamming...|$|R

We have previously shown that satellite cell activation is partially controlled by the bioactive phospholipid, sphingosine- 1 -phosphate, and that S 1 P biosynthesis is required for muscle regeneration. Here we investigate the role of sphingosine- 1 -phosphate receptor 3 (S 1 PR 3) in regulating murine satellite cell function. S 1 PR 3 levels were high in quiescent myogenic cells before falling during entry into cell cycle. Retrovirally-mediated constitutive expression of S 1 PR 3 led to suppressed cell cycle progression in satellite cells, but did not overtly affect the myogenic program. Conversely, satellite cells isolated from S 1 PR 3 -null mice exhibited enhanced proliferation ex-vivo. In vivo, acute cardiotoxin-induced muscle regeneration was enhanced in S 1 PR 3 -null mice, with bigger muscle fibres compared to control mice. Importantly, genetically deleting S 1 PR 3 in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy produced a less severe muscle dystrophic phenotype, than when signalling though S 1 PR 3 was <b>operational.</b> In <b>conclusion,</b> signalling though S 1 PR 3 suppresses cell cycle progression to regulate function in muscle satellite cells...|$|R

However, there is limited literature on the range of endoscopy unit efficiencies. Methods. A time and motion analysis of patient flow through the Hotel-Dieu Hospital (Kingston, Ontario) endoscopy unit was followed by qualitative interviews. Procedures were directly observed in three segments: individual endoscopy room use, preprocedure/recovery room, and overall endoscopy unit utilization. Results. Data were collected for 137 procedures in the endoscopy room, 139 procedures in the preprocedure room, and 143 procedures for overall room utilization. The mean duration spent in the endoscopy room was 31. 47 [*]min for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, 52. 93 [*]min for a colonoscopy, 30. 47 [*]min for a flexible sigmoidoscopy, and 66. 88 [*]min for a double procedure.

The {{aim of this study}} was the production in high yields of a recombinant pectin lyase that is efficiently secreted and the encapsulation of transformed E. coli cells for pectin degradation in a biotechnological process. Results The nucleotide sequence of Bacillus subtilis α-amylase's signal peptide was fused to the N-terminal of an heterologously expressed pectin lyase in E. coli BL 21 [DE 3]. Thus pectin lyase secretion was achieved into the extracellular growth medium. E. coli cells harboring the recombinant plasmid heterologously express pectin lyase to around 22 % of the total cellular proteins, as it was estimated by SDS-PAGE and image analysis. IPTG induces the heterologously expressed enzyme, which is initially distributed extracellularly (7 hour) and later on at the periplasmic (9 hours) or cytosolic fraction (20 hours). No pectin lyase activity was found in the membranes fraction and in the inclusion bodies.

40|$|Changes in the {{environment}} surrounding mining companies require {{a change in the}} way of thinking about the business and the reformulation of management strategies, especially in the area of human resources. Providing the right quality of human capital and ensuring its proper administration is essential to ensure efficient market operation. In this paper the practical operation of key components, in relation to the social potential of a mining company, in terms of human capital and occupational safety is discussed. Analysis led to the evaluation of current actions and indicated possibilities for the future management of these two elements (human capital and occupational safety) within the scope of the operational strategy of a coal mine. In the study qualitative methods were primarily used, such as: IDI – in-depth interviews with representatives (of collieries and coal companies) and social experts, a case study, and desk research (the critical analysis of existing documents). Qualitative methods were supported by quantitative study (existing data analysis). On the basis of empirical research, key components of sustainable development in mining business operations were indicated. These components develop social potential and create new opportunities, which exist due to the use of modern strategic business management in accordance with the new economy business model. Empirical studies conducted in coal companies and collieries in Poland attempted to explain which components are crucial for mining companies and how they have been used in <b>operational</b> practice; <b>conclusions</b> can be used in company management. Surveys like this have not been conducted in Poland to date. These surveys allow the social potential of a mining company and the consequences of its development or weakening to be understood...|$|R
40|$|Today's {{competition}} between supply chains (SC) requires optimized strategies {{in order to}} satisfy customers' demands. The business models used by the SC members play a big role in this delivery of value to the customer. From here the notion that a mismatch between the intended market and the business model used to address it translates into a poor SC performance. As real-life business environments have become really complex, SC members have been forced to use hybrid business models (that is, the integration of features of two different business models). A review of the literature in the area of supply chain management shows that past research have not paid much attention to this issue. The objective {{of this paper is to}} quantitatively evaluate the influence these hybrid business models have on the SC performance. For this purpose, a system dynamics (SD) simulation model is developed and tested under different <b>operational</b> conditions, so <b>conclusions</b> can be derived regarding the benefits of the use of hybrid business models. Hybrid business models Systems dynamics simulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} studies on {{operational}} and environmental parameters buses used on bus routes Zhitomir city. It uses statistical methods for determining the intensity of traffic, passenger traffic and ecology in traffic. To assess the environmental chosen stop with the greatest intensity of traffic, which is the probability of accumulation of pollution transport emissions that exceed permissible limits. Calculation of environmental pollution emission route for vehicles made stops street «Str. Hundreds of Heaven» «CUM», «vul. Hlibna» on the main trunk street Kievska. Results obtained environmental field experiments compared with the data defined calculation methods, based on the proposed use appropriate <b>operational</b> vehicles. The <b>conclusions</b> that indicate {{the seriousness of the}} problem and the urgency to address it. The system of environmental safety and road safety in Zhitomir requires significant improvements due to the increased quantities bus vehicles plying city routes. Recommendations to improve the ecological condition of intersections can be developed through the optimization of traffic using buses with environmentally improved operating parameters.
