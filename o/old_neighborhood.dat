5|$|One of {{the most}} {{depressing}} sections of Chicago is the Uptown area on the North Side. Shabby apartment buildings, vacant stores, wino bars, littered vacant lots, junkies, muggers, and career down-and-outers. It also has a new alderman, Helen Shiller, {{and she has a}} vision of what that seedy <b>old</b> <b>neighborhood</b> should be in the future. And apparently her vision is that Uptown should remain a seedy <b>old</b> <b>neighborhood.</b>|$|E
5|$|Michelle {{is another}} New Yorker, in her forties, who {{believed}} {{she was the only}} Hasidic lesbian in the world and as a consequence allowed herself to be pressured into marriage. However, she got divorced and was subsequently ostracized by her family and community when they discovered she was homosexual. The film shows her visiting her <b>old</b> <b>neighborhood</b> and an Orthodox fair.|$|E
5|$|After the New York City draft {{riots in}} 1863, Smith {{and his family}} were among {{prominent}} blacks who left New York and moved to Brooklyn, then still a separate city. He no longer felt safe in his <b>old</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> In the 1870 census, Malvina and her four children were living in Ward 15, Brooklyn. All were listed as white. James W. Smith, who had married a white woman, was living in a separate household and working as a teacher; he was also classified as white. The Smith children still at home were Maud, 15; Donald, 12; John, 10; and Guy, 8; all were attending school. Five Smith children survived to adulthood: James, Maud, Donald, John and Guy. The men married white spouses, but Maud never married. All were classified as white from 1860 on.|$|E

5|$|McNulty harbors {{a grudge}} against his former commanders for reassigning {{him to the}} marine unit. When {{thirteen}} unidentified young women are found dead in a container at the docks, McNulty successfully makes a spiteful effort to place the murders within the jurisdiction of his former commander. Meanwhile, police Major Stan Valchek gets into a feud with Polish-American Frank Sobotka, {{a leader of the}} International Brotherhood of Stevedores, a fictional dockers' union, over competing donations to their <b>old</b> <b>neighborhood</b> church. Valchek demands a detail to investigate Sobotka. Cedric Daniels is interviewed, having been praised by Prez, Major Valchek's son-in-law, and also because of his work on the Barksdale case. He is eventually selected to lead the detail assigned just to investigate Sobotka; when the investigation is concluded Daniels is assured he will move up to head a special case unit with personnel of his choosing.|$|E
5|$|With Rashad narrating the film's final scene, Teddy {{opens his}} own {{business}} concerning the production of gold teeth, as Big Gipp makes a cameo appearance in his shop, Brooklyn finds {{a job at a}} Krystal restaurant, while Esquire receives a mysterious letter of recommendation (presumably from Garnett) and is able to attend his college. The twins Veda and Star remain in the <b>old</b> <b>neighborhood</b> and hang out at Cascade on Sundays, while Erin goes to Spelman College, the school she wanted to attend, in which Rashad appreciates a lot more because she's still close. Uncle George starts attending church more often and finds a good woman to date. Ant changes direction, discarding the notion of drug dealing, finds a new girlfriend and begins to focus on his studies in school. Rashad, lastly, becomes a comic artist for the Sunday edition of the Atlanta Evening Standard, the city's newspaper. The film ends with Rashad leaving his skates in Cascades, and the building's lights go off.|$|E
25|$|Finally, the G.I. Bill made it {{possible}} for many Ybor City-born veterans to get a college education and start a career outside of the dying local cigar industry. While many of these eventually settled back in Tampa after finishing school, few could find suitable employment in their <b>old</b> <b>neighborhood</b> and relocated as well. For all these reasons, Ybor City’s WWII generation was the first to leave the area in large numbers since Vicente Martinez-Ybor had first cleared the scrubland in 1885.|$|E

25|$|The Oldham Methodist Secondary School {{merged with}} the Secondary School at Barker Road in January 1961. The school {{completed}} {{the construction of the}} sports complex at Barker Road in 1970, with an Olympic-sized swimming pool (the first in all the schools in Singapore) and a sports hall. In 1977, pre-university classes shifted to the newly constructed Anglo-Chinese Junior College at 25 Dover Close East, off North Buona Vista Road, leaving the Barker Road site for the secondary and junior schools. The junior school relocated to new premises in its <b>old</b> <b>neighborhood</b> at Cairnhill in 1985.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1950s, Montevideo's prosperous {{middle classes}} {{have tended to}} abandon the {{formerly}} fashionable downtown areas for the more modern high-rise apartment buildings of Pocitos, a beachfront neighborhood east of the center. Still farther east lies the expensive area of Carrasco, a zone of modern luxury villas {{that has come to}} replace the <b>old</b> <b>neighborhood</b> of El Prado in the north of the city as home to the country's wealthy elite. Its beaches were less polluted than those closer to the center. Montevideo's Carrasco International Airport is located nearby, crossing the border to Canelones Department. The capital's principal artery, 18 July Avenue, was long the principal shopping street of Montevideo, but it has been hurt since the mid-1980s by the construction of a modern shopping mall strategically located between Pocitos and Carrasco.|$|E
500|$|During {{its first}} years, the daily Winnie Winkle evolved from simple gags to more complex humorous situations. A new {{character}} {{was introduced in}} the form of Perry, a little boy from the backstreets, whom the Winkles adopted in 1922. The focus of the Sunday pages then shifted to the adventures of Perry at home, school and on the streets. Although compelled to wear a duffle coat and fancy clothes, he continued to frequent his <b>old</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> The local gang, the Rinkydinks, in contrast, still wore torn and patchy clothing, and were regarded by Winnie as [...] "loafers." [...] One member of the Rinkydinks was the dunce, Denny Dimwit, who popularized the catch phrase, [...] "Youse is a good boy, Denny." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Tik Tok" [...] was {{directed}} by Syndrome. It was shot in Kesha's <b>old</b> <b>neighborhood</b> and the car featured in the video belongs to her. Kesha explained the experience saying, [...] "the video I'm excited about because I actually got to shoot it in my <b>old</b> <b>neighborhood</b> and the guy driving my gold car {{is a friend of}} mine". The video's party scene was shot in her friend's house, which they refer to as the [...] "drunk tank". The singer said [...] "the last party scene is in this house called the drunk tank, which is one of my friend's houses that we all go party at. So I like it cause its super-honest and genuine." [...] The video begins with Kesha waking in a bathtub in a home as she stumbles out and begins to look for a toothbrush in the restroom. She makes her way down a staircase looking at the pictures lining the wall. Kesha makes her way to the kitchen and walks in on a family who are having breakfast, startling them. She shrugs and then leaves the home as the family gets up and follows her. When she arrives at the sidewalk, she picks up a gold bicycle lying against a fallen fence and rides off. Kesha meets a group of children and trades the bicycle for their boombox. The video cuts to another scene where she rejects a guy and is picked up by a man portrayed by Simon Rex who drives her in a gold 1978 Trans Am. They are pulled over by the police, who handcuff Kesha. The scene then pans to her singing while standing in the T-top as she dangles the handcuffs hanging from her left arm. The next scene shows Kesha in an empty room filled with glitter. She then attends a party with Rex for the final scene. The video comes to an end with Kesha lying in a different bathtub from the one she woke up in. The official music video has received over 360 million views on YouTube as of July 2017.|$|E

50|$|Executive {{homes are}} {{generally}} found in outlying suburban areas because lot sizes in <b>older</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> generally are {{not conducive to}} new residences of this large scale. However {{there have been many}} instances of developers buying large lots or multiple lots in historic <b>neighborhoods,</b> demolishing the <b>older</b> homes and building executive homes. This may have the effect of destroying the setting of <b>older</b> <b>neighborhoods,</b> and adversely impacting the integrity of historic districts. These lots are in desirable neighborhoods, and desirable school districts, and are close to urban centers, so the trend will likely continue. However, some communities such as Wellesley, Massachusetts and Austin, Texas have created policies and ordinances to retain <b>older</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> against these development pressures.|$|R

2500|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, {{many of these}} same old brick {{buildings}} on 7th Avenue had been converted into bars, restaurants, nightclubs, and other nightlife attractions. [...] The crowds grew until portions of the <b>old</b> <b>neighborhood</b> became a nighttime carnival, especially on weekends. The city built parking garages and closed 7th Ave. to traffic {{to deal with the}} growth in visitors.|$|E
2500|$|Years later, {{the case}} has not been forgotten. On October 1, 2006, {{hundreds}} of people wearing shirts reading [...] "Justice for Deanna" [...] marched through her <b>old</b> <b>neighborhood</b> seeking action on the case. The case has been repeatedly featured on WFXT television [...] "New England's Unsolved", through 2009. On March 30, 2013, hundreds of supporters retraced her last path {{through the streets of}} Somerville's Winter Hill neighborhood. On March 31, 2014, the Mayor of Somerville announced a $50,000 reward to help find the people, or person behind Deanna Cremin's murder. In 2015, on the twentieth anniversary of the murder, the case continued to receive national coverage, Middlesex County district attorney Marian Ryan was still asking anyone with information to contact her office, and the reward for information had reached $70,000.|$|E
2500|$|Morton Feldman's I Met Heine on the Rue Fürstemberg was {{inspired}} by a vision he had of the dead Heine as he walked through Heine's <b>old</b> <b>neighborhood</b> in Paris: [...] "One early morning in Paris I was walking along the small street on the Left Bank where Delacroix's studio is, just as {{it was more than a}} century ago. I'd read his journals, where he tells of Chopin, going for a drive, the poet Heine dropping in, a refugee from Germany. Nothing had changed in the street. And I saw Heine up at the corner, walking toward me. He almost reached me. I had this intense feeling for him, you know, the Jewish exile. I saw him. Then I went back to my place and wrote my work, I Met Heine on the Rue Fürstemberg." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Bronx {{has been}} {{featured}} significantly in fiction literature. All {{of the characters}} in Herman Wouk's [...] (1948) live in the Bronx, and about half of the action is set there. Kate Simon's Bronx Primitive: Portraits of a Childhood is directly autobiographical, a warm account of a Polish-Jewish girl in an immigrant family growing up before World War II, and living near Arthur Avenue and Tremont Avenue. In Jacob M. Appel's short story, [...] "The Grand Concourse" [...] (2007), a woman {{who grew up in the}} iconic Lewis Morris Building returns to the Morrisania neighborhood with her adult daughter. Similarly, in Avery Corman's book The <b>Old</b> <b>Neighborhood</b> (1980), an upper-middle class white protagonist returns to his birth neighborhood (Fordham Road and the Grand Concourse), and learns that even though the folks are poor, Hispanic and African-American, they are good people.|$|E
2500|$|When cross-examined by the {{assistant}} prosecutor Jens Olav Sæther, the defendant {{made a series}} of claims which were described as [...] "bizarre". He claimed to be in possession of a mirror with apparent magical powers, for example the ability to grant physical protection from enemies or to compel an individual to [...] "confess" [...] bad deeds. He claimed that he had been stalked and harassed in his home-town of Ålesund by groups of local children who were under the direct influence of a prison inmate in Oslo. He said he had received violent threats from members of a child pornography ring. When asked about his psychiatric evaluation, he claimed that the expert neuropsychiatrist who examined him, and concluded that he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, was in fact working as a belly dancer in his <b>old</b> <b>neighborhood.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The city of Buffalo has {{two full}} Saint Patrick's Day parades. The {{first is the}} [...] "Old Neighborhood Parade," [...] in its 24th year in 2017, which {{takes place in the}} city's {{historic}} Old First Ward in South Buffalo on the Saturday nearest Saint Patrick's Day (before or after); through 2015, that parade followed a route used by the original Saint Patrick's Day parades in Buffalo, until crowd concerns and drunken rowdiness forced the city to reroute the parade through wider roads in the First Ward. The older, larger [...] "Buffalo Saint Patrick's Day Parade" [...] (in its 75th consecutive year in 2017) also takes place, usually on the day after the <b>Old</b> <b>Neighborhood</b> parade. That parade runs from Niagara Square along Delaware Avenue to North Street.
