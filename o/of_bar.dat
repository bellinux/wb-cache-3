5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the race, Häkkinen moved into the lead of the Drivers' Championship, on 64 points, taking the championship lead {{for the first time in}} the 2000 season. Michael Schumacher lost the lead of the Drivers' Championship, falling two points behind Häkkinen. Coulthard maintained third place with 58 points, nine points ahead of Barrichello and forty-one in front of Fisichella. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren took over the lead of the Constructors' Championship with 112 points, pushing Ferrari on 111 points to second place. Williams increased the gap to Benetton to 6 points, with Jordan jumping ahead <b>of</b> <b>BAR</b> for fifth on 12 points. Despite McLaren taking the lead of both championships, their team principal Ron Dennis acknowledged that he expected both his drivers would have the advantage in the most of the five remaining races although he believed that being complacent would reduce McLaren's chances of success.|$|E
5|$|Coke iron was {{initially}} only used for foundry work, making pots and other cast iron goods. Foundry work {{was a minor}} branch of the industry, but Darby's son built a new furnace at nearby Horsehay, and began to supply the owners of finery forges with coke pig iron for the production <b>of</b> <b>bar</b> iron. Coke pig iron was by this time cheaper to produce than charcoal pig iron. The use of a coal-derived fuel in the iron industry was {{a key factor in}} the British Industrial Revolution. Darby's original blast furnace has been archaeologically excavated and can be seen in situ at Coalbrookdale, part of the Ironbridge Gorge Museums. Cast iron from the furnace was used to make girders for the world's first iron bridge in 1779. The Iron Bridge crosses the River Severn at Coalbrookdale and remains in use for pedestrians.|$|E
5|$|Coulthard {{started the}} race {{alongside}} Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher who began from pole position.

During the course of the second stint of the race, Michael Schumacher began to struggle with tyre wear, allowing Coulthard to close the gap and passed him on lap 40. Coulthard maintained his lead through the second round of pit stops and won the race. Michael Schumacher retired on lap 59 with an engine failure promoting Häkkinen into second position.

5|$|In 1827 {{a rolling}} mill capable of 100 tons <b>of</b> <b>bar</b> iron per week was {{installed}} at the Walker Ironworks; in the same year, Losh, Wilson and Bell's Walker foundry was listed in Parson and White's gazetteer of Durham and Northumberland as a steam engine manufacturer. In 1833, the iron puddling process was installed at Walker. In 1835, while working as an inspector of construction on the Whitby & Pickering Railway, Thomas Wilson noted the presence of ironstone in a railway cutting at Grosmont, and arranged for drift mines to exploit the find; the new railway carried the ore to Whitby. In that year, {{at the age of}} nineteen, Thomas Bell's son Lowthian Bell entered the firm's Newcastle office under his father. In 1836 he joined his father at the firm's ironworks at Walker.|$|E
5|$|In 1869 reformers again left Baith Israel, and, joining with dissenters from Kahal Kodesh Beth Elohim of Williamsburg, founded Temple Israel. Though many reformers {{had left}} the congregation, several reforms in the service were {{nonetheless}} introduced: the congregation abolished most piyyutim and the Priestly Blessing, and, in 1873, introduced a confirmation ceremony for girls, led by the Reverend Dr. Tinter. The confirmation ceremonies, which had initially been held during the holiday of Sukkot, were eventually moved to the holiday of Shavuot (the holiday during which the Reform movement held these ceremonies), and continued for {{both boys and girls}} (in place <b>of</b> <b>Bar</b> and Bat Mitzvah celebrations) until the 1940s.|$|E

5|$|King Stanisław August's {{acquiescence}} to the Russian intervention encountered some opposition. On February 29, 1768, several magnatesincluding Józef Pułaski and {{his young}} son Kazimierz Pułaski (Casimir Pulaski)vowing to oppose Russian influence, declared Stanisław August a lackey of Russia and Catherine, and formed a confederation at the town <b>of</b> <b>Bar.</b> The Bar Confederation focused on limiting the influence of foreigners in Commonwealth affairs, and being pro-Catholic was generally opposed to religious tolerance. It began a civil war to overthrow the King, but its irregular forces were overwhelmed by Russian intervention in 1772.|$|E

5|$|Tadeusz Rejtan was {{a deputy}} in the Sejm (parliament) of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1773, infamously {{known as the}} Partition Sejm. The Sejm convened to review {{the demands of the}} Commonwealth's three {{neighbours}} (the Russian Empire, Prussia and Austria) in order to legalize their territorial demands, known as the First Partition of Poland. The Sejm operated under duress, with the immediate threat of foreign forces present in the Commonwealth, and with a significant number of deputies either bribed or threatened by foreign diplomats. The three powers officially justified their actions as a compensation for dealing with a troublesome neighbor and restoring order through military intervention in the civil war (the War <b>of</b> <b>Bar</b> Confederation); in fact all three were interested in territorial gains.|$|E

From there, they spread first to the Pays de Bray on the eastern boundary of Normandy and from there to the Weald of Sussex, where the first furnace (called Queenstock) in Buxted was built in about 1491, followed by one at Newbridge in Ashdown Forest in 1496. They remained few in number until about 1530 but many were built in the following decades in the Weald, where the iron industry perhaps reached its peak about 1590.

5|$|The oldest {{preserved}} hagiography of Saint Jovan Vladimir {{is contained}} in Chapter 36 of the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja. This chronicle, written in Latin, was completed between 1299 and 1301 in the town <b>of</b> <b>Bar,</b> then part of the Serbian Kingdom. Its author was Rudger, the Catholic Archbishop <b>of</b> <b>Bar,</b> who was probably of Czech origin. He wrote Chapter 36 as a summary of an older hagiography of Vladimir, written in Duklja most likely sometime between 1075 and 1089. This is the period when Duklja's rulers from the Vojislavljević dynasty endeavored to obtain the royal insignia from the Pope, and to elevate the Bar Bishopric to an archbishopric. They represented Prince Vladimir as the saintly founder of their dynasty; they were, according to the chronicle, descendants of his uncle Dragimir. The Vojislavljevićs succeeded in those endeavors, though Vladimir was not recognized as a saint by the Catholic Church. Despite its hagiographic nature, Chapter 36 contains a lot of reliable historical data. Chapters 34 and 35, which deal with Vladimir's father and uncles, are probably based on the prologue of the 11th-century hagiography. Chapters 1–33 of the chronicle are based on oral traditions and its author's constructions, and {{are for the most}} part dismissed by historians.|$|E
5|$|Hugh was {{suspected}} {{of involvement in}} the Young King's revolt in 1173. He {{does not seem to have}} taken an active part, but King Henry II suspected him of supporting the rebellion. When King William the Lion of Scotland invaded northern England in the spring of 1174, Hugh either connived at the invasion or helped the rebels and the Scottish king. Suspicion fell upon the bishop because he was cautious in defending against the Scottish raids. Hugh also concluded truces with the Scots that allowed them free passage through the ecclesiastical lands in return for no damage being done to those lands. Lastly, the bishop's nephew Hugh IV de Puiset, who was Count <b>of</b> <b>Bar</b> in France, brought an armed force to Hartlepool, supposedly to help defend Hugh, but King Henry feared that this was an attempt to aid the rebellion of the Young King. After the revolt had been put down, King Henry II ordered Hugh's castle of Northallerton destroyed. Hugh also was required to surrender his other castles.|$|E

5|$|The cross Vladimir held {{when he was}} {{beheaded}} is also {{regarded as}} a relic. Traditionally {{under the care of}} the Andrović family from the village of Velji Mikulići in southeastern Montenegro, the cross is only shown to believers on the Feast of Pentecost, when it is carried in a procession to the summit of Mount Rumija. Jovan Vladimir is regarded as the first Serbian saint and the patron saint of the town <b>of</b> <b>Bar</b> in Montenegro. His earliest, lost hagiography was probably written sometime between 1075 and 1089; a shortened version, written in Latin, is preserved in the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja. His hagiographies in Greek and Church Slavonic were first published, respectively, in 1690 and 1802. The saint is classically depicted in icons as a monarch wearing a crown and regal clothes, with a cross in his right hand and his own head in his left hand. He is fabled to have carried his severed head to his place of burial.|$|E
