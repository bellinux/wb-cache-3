5|$|Negative effects <b>on</b> <b>fisheries</b> {{are mostly}} {{restricted}} to raiding by birds on aquaculture, although long-lining fisheries {{also have to}} deal with bait stealing. There have been claims of prey depletion by seabirds of fishery stocks, and while there is some evidence of this, the effects of seabirds are considered smaller than that of marine mammals and predatory fish (like tuna).|$|E
5|$|Before the New Waddell Dam was constructed, {{two phases}} of a {{three-phase}} study {{were carried out}} {{to determine the effects}} of the dam <b>on</b> <b>fisheries.</b> Completed in 2005, the third phase of the study determined that the larger reservoir has less nutrient concentrations due to CAP water introduction and that water fluctuations have reduced fish cover, likely affecting food and spawning. Large mouth bass populations have also declined but striped bass have entered the lake, likely by eggs transferred through CAP water. Around the lake, Reclamation has taken steps to protect wildlife habitats, including those for bald eagles and Gila topminnows.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} {{referred}} to the Natural Resources Committee, which then referred it to its Subcommittee <b>on</b> <b>Fisheries,</b> Wildlife and Oceans, chaired by Bordallo. Hearings were held a week later, at which Shelley Clarke, a researcher at Imperial College London who studies the shark-fin trade, observed that transshipment operations such as the KD IIs were common and would likely continue as the competition in Hong Kong, the industry's traditional center, grew more intense. While the transshipment ban was an effective response to the decision, she suggested that shipments of containerized fins be allowed {{if they had been}} separated from their carcasses after landing.|$|E

5|$|The fulmarine petrels are generalists, {{which for}} the most part take many species of fish and crustacea. The giant petrels, uniquely for Procellariiformes, will feed on land, eating the carrion of other seabirds and seals. They will also attack the chicks of other seabirds. The diet of the giant petrels varies {{according}} to sex, with the females taking more krill and the males more carrion. All the fulmarine petrels readily feed <b>on</b> <b>fisheries</b> discards at sea, a habit that has been implicated in (but not proved to have caused) the expansion in range of the northern fulmar in the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of shark fisheries have little monitoring or management. The rise {{in demand for}} shark products increases pressure <b>on</b> <b>fisheries.</b> Major declines in shark stocks have been recorded—some species have been depleted by over 90% over the past 20–30 years with population declines of 70% not unusual. A study by the International Union for Conservation of Nature suggests that one quarter of all known species of sharks and rays are threatened by extinction and 25 species were classified as critically endangered.|$|E

25|$|The Law <b>on</b> <b>Fisheries</b> {{requires}} that {{total allowable catch}} (TAC) levels are set for fishery stocks. It defines these levels as the “scientifically justified annual catch of aquatic biological resources of particular species in a fishing area”. However, the Law <b>on</b> <b>Fisheries</b> {{then goes on to}} state that industrial fisheries are not necessarily required to base their catch on TAC. The Law does not explain this further, but calls {{for the federal government to}} issue a special TAC setting statute. Pacific salmon is the main stock that will probably not have TAC, but will have regulated fishing effort instead.|$|E
25|$|However, {{while the}} Department of Conservation has {{approved}} the project, {{and has made}} substantial environmental monitoring conditions part of the consent, the project also has objectors {{on the grounds of}} claimed influences on the local ecosystems and charter fishing (see the section above <b>on</b> <b>fisheries).</b> Appeals before the Environment Court are still likely.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{research}} aims {{to explore}} how the protection <b>on</b> <b>fishery</b> in the Indonesian territorial and Economy Exclusive Zone in Aceh and obstacles faced {{by the government in}} providing the protection <b>on</b> <b>fishery</b> resources in Aceh. Descriptive analytical method is applied to describe and find the legal facts wholly relating to the protection. The research shows that the implementation of monitoring in terms of conducting the laws has obstacles especially regarding the staffs monitoring it, patrol vessels and budget in monitoring the protection. It is expected that the government should add more staff and providing enough supporting facilities for the law enforcers in fishery field hence the rules can be enforced and the resource can guarantee the need of next generations.   The Protection <b>on</b> <b>Fishery</b> Resources at the Indonesian Territorial and Exclusive Economy Zone in Ace...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} changes in law sector (political law), {{particularly}} in maritime and fishery sector, have the consequences of changes to happen.

Fishery crime in Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 s territory are dominated by IUU fishing (Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing).

25|$|UNCLOS {{does not}} {{prescribe}} precisely how fisheries confined only to international waters should be managed. Several new fisheries (such as high seas bottom trawling fisheries) are not (yet) subject to international agreement across their entire range.

25|$|Fisheries {{management}} draws <b>on</b> <b>fisheries</b> {{science in}} order to find ways to protect fishery resources so sustainable exploitation is possible. Modern fisheries management {{is often referred to as}} a governmental system of (hopefully appropriate) management rules based on defined objectives and a mix of management means to implement the rules, which are put in place by a system of monitoring control and surveillance.|$|E

It is also important for freight handling and for tourism, as cruise ships stop in Akureyri during the summer months.

25|$|After Bonaventure was {{decommissioned}} in 1970, all remaining Canadian Trackers {{were transferred}} to shore bases.

25|$|The {{ecological}} and social impacts {{have been examined}} in great details and remedial actions have been planned for all the identified impacts.

25|$|In the past, {{sturgeon}} {{has been}} an important catch in the basin of the Sea of Azov and the Caspian Sea, and in Siberian Rivers and the Amur River. Currently, sturgeon stocks are heavily depleted and under constant pressure from poaching. Inland fisheries are regulated by the Law <b>on</b> <b>Fisheries</b> discussed above. However, few provisions refer specifically to inland fisheries, although there are specific regulations for same catchments and river systems. These regulations specify closed areas, seasonal closures, gear restrictions, minimum mesh sizes and minimum catch size.|$|E

In 1988 it carried out 1,273 inspections, of which 21 involved seizure and 16 were reported. However, written warnings were issued in 268 cases, and 106 oral warnings were given.|$|E
25|$|Impressed by Sette′s use of {{statistics}} {{in studying the}} sardine fishery at Monterey, United States Commissioner of Fisheries Henry O’Malley hired Sette in 1924 {{to work at the}} headquarters of the United States Bureau of Fisheries in Washington, D.C., as Chief of the Division of Fishery Industries. Beginning work in his new position on January 8, 1924, Sette supervised the bureau′s research in fishery technology, particularly the canning and preservation of fishery products, as well the distribution of technological and production information <b>on</b> <b>fisheries</b> to the public. He also was responsible for a special effort to improve the United States Government′s system of collecting and publishing fisheries statistics.

Graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Zoology in June 1922, he returned to the California State Fisheries Laboratory, working in Monterey during the sardine fishing season and for the rest of the year at the San Pedro Laboratory, where he conducted research related to the tuna fishery.
