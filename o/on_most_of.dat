Playing the bass, as he did <b>on</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> All Things Must Pass, was Klaus Voormann, who would be another to find sanctuary at Friar Park. Harrison offered him refuge from the media in March and April 1971, when reports had Voormann linked to a supposed Beatles offshoot band, along with Harrison, Starr and John Lennon.|$|E
5|$|Although the 2012 Olympic men's {{basketball}} tournament was then {{more than a}} year away, qualifying tournaments in all five of FIBA's continental zones were to be held in the Northern Hemisphere summer of 2011 (the traditional basketball offseason throughout the world). The lockout resulted in the suspension of an agreement between the NBA and FIBA by which the NBA would take <b>on</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the costs for insuring the value of its players' contracts in the event they were injured during international competition. As a result, national federations that wish to have NBA players on their squads must now provide full coverage instead of supplemental insurance.|$|E

5|$|In {{a special}} congressional {{election}} held June 20, Unionist candidates won nine of Kentucky's ten congressional seats. Confederate sympathizers won only the Jackson Purchase region, which was economically linked to Tennessee by the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers. Believing defeat {{at the polls}} was certain, many Southern Rightists had boycotted the election; of the 125,000 votes cast, Unionists captured close to 90,000. Confederate sympathizers were dealt a further blow in the August 5 election for state legislators. This election resulted in veto-proof Unionist majorities of 76–24 in the House and 27–11 in the Senate.

Nearly all the fighting was outside of the state's boundaries. Only one significant conflict, known as Morgan's Raid, occurred on Indiana soil during the war. The raid, which caused a brief panic in Indianapolis and southern Indiana, was preceded by two minor incursions into Indiana.|$|E

Carey also faced media criticism over her choice of producers and several newspapers linked Carey romantically to several rappers, suggesting these relationships influenced her decisions. However, Carey denied the allegations, stating she had only slept with her husband.|$|E
