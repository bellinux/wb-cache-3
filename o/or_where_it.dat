Giáp realized that, if pressed, the French would abandon Lai Châu Province and fight a pitched battle at Điện Biên Phủ. On 24 November, Giáp ordered the 148th Infantry Regiment and the 316th Division to attack Lai Chau, while the 308th, 312th, and 351st divisions assault Điện Biên Phủ from Việt Bắc.|$|E

25|$|At {{the close}} of Trajan's first {{campaign}} in Dacia in 102, he stationed one legion at Sarmizegetusa Regia. With the conclusion of Trajan's conquest of Dacia, he stationed at least two legions in the new province – the Legio IV Flavia Felix positioned at Berzobis, and the Legio XIII Gemina stationed at Apulum. It has been conjectured {{that there was a}} third legion stationed in Dacia at the same time, the Legio I Adiutrix. However, {{there is no evidence to}} indicate when <b>or</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> was stationed, and it is unclear whether the legion was fully present, or whether it was only the vexillationes who were stationed in the province.|$|E
25|$|Sounds are {{transmitted}} via a receiver attached from {{the arm of}} the spectacles which are fitted firmly behind the boney portion of the skull {{at the back of the}} ear, (mastoid process) by means of pressure, applied on {{the arm of the}} spectacles. The sound is passed from the receiver on the arm of the spectacles to the inner ear (cochlea), via the bony portion. The process of transmitting the sound through the bone requires a great amount of power. Bone conduction aids generally have a poorer high pitch response and are therefore best used for conductive hearing losses <b>or</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> is impractical to fit standard hearing aids.|$|E

25|$|The {{prefrontal cortex}} (and in {{particular}} the right hemisphere) is also involved {{in the formation of}} new episodic memories (also known as episodic encoding). Patients with damage to the prefrontal cortex can learn new information, but tend to do so in a disordered fashion. For example, they might show normal recognition of an object they had seen in the past, but fail to recollect when <b>or</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> had been viewed. Some researchers believe that the prefrontal cortex helps organize information for more efficient storage, drawing upon its role in executive function. Others believe that the prefrontal cortex underlies semantic strategies which enhance encoding, such as thinking about the meaning of the study material or rehearsing it in working memory.|$|E

25|$|A {{resident}} {{who wishes to}} challenge the validity of an ordinance need not wait until it has been enforced against them (although it may be challenged at that time). Instead, a resident may bring an action for a declaratory judgment alleging that the ordinance is void {{because it was not}} properly noticed, goes beyond the county charter, is arbitrary, discriminatory, or unreasonably vague, or that it is preempted by state or federal law. An ordinance will be deemed preempted if it addresses an activity for which the state has prohibited local regulation altogether, <b>or</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> is inconsistent with state law. An ordinance may not permit an activity that is expressly prohibited by state law, or prohibits an activity that is expressly permitted by state law. However, if some state regulation exists as to an activity, political subdivisions may impose further regulations on that activity so long as it is possible for a resident to comply with both sets of regulations.|$|E
25|$|Although {{technically}} {{an appeal}} {{is required for}} the umpire to make a decision, in practice it is often obvious to all that a batsman is out, and the batsman may walk off the field without waiting for the decision of the umpire. This is invariably the case when a batsman is out bowled or to an obvious catch. However, the batsman is always entitled to stand his ground and wait for a decision from the umpire. In cases where he considers he might not be out, such as a catch taken low near the grass <b>or</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> is not clear whether the ball hit the bat, batsmen will not take the walking option. It is then up to the fielding team to appeal for a decision. Sometimes a batsman will walk even when it is not clear to others that he is out, if in his own mind he is certain he was out; this is considered to be the epitome of sportsmanlike behaviour.|$|E

He asked to be discharged, or at least bailed, on the grounds that there was not sufficient evidence against him and that he had been already acquitted. He also argued that as the offence, if any, had been committed outside British dominions, he could only be tried by special commission, and it was uncertain whether the Crown would issue one or not, or when <b>or</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> would sit. He argued his own case with the skill of a practised lawyer. The authorities, however, declined either to bail or discharge him, and he was kept in custody until he was sent a prisoner to England, to stand his trial.|$|E
500|$|Known for his charisma, personality, and iconic stature on the court, Rudolph symbolized NBA officiating {{during the}} early years of the NBA to fans of {{professional}} basketball and became the most recognizable official during the NBA's first four decades. [...] Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe said of Rudolph, [...] "If any man other than Red Auerbach ever earned the title of NBA institution, it was certainly Mendy Rudolph." [...] Upon retirement, he set a precedent for the standards that future referees are judged. [...] Early in his officiating career, Joe Crawford (later hired by the NBA in 1977) attended games that Rudolph worked in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and studied his style and approach. [...] Earl Strom credited Rudolph for being an influence on the development of his career in the NBA. [...] In his autobiography, Calling the Shots, Strom described Rudolph as [...] "one of the most prominent referees because of his style, courage, and judgment. [...] He had excellent judgment. [...] He made the call regardless of the pressure, whom it involved, <b>or</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> was."

500|$|For {{many decades}} the Scots legal system was unique {{for being the}} only legal system without a parliament. This ended {{with the advent of}} the Scottish Parliament, which legislates for Scotland. Many {{features}} within the system have been preserved. Within criminal law, the Scots legal system is unique in having three possible verdicts: [...] "guilty", [...] "not guilty" [...] and [...] "not proven". Both [...] "not guilty" [...] and [...] "not proven" [...] result in an acquittal, typically with no possibility of retrial in accordance with the rule of double jeopardy. There is however the possibility of a retrial where new evidence emerges at a later date that might have proven conclusive in the earlier trial at first instance, where the person acquitted subsequently admits the offence <b>or</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> can be proved that the acquittal was tainted by an attempt to pervert the course of justice – see the provisions of the Double Jeopardy (Scotland) Act 2011. Many laws differ between Scotland and the other parts of the United Kingdom, and many terms differ for certain legal concepts. Manslaughter, in England and Wales, is broadly similar to culpable homicide in Scotland, and arson is called wilful fire raising. Indeed, some acts considered crimes in England and Wales, such as forgery, are not so in Scotland. Procedure also differs. Scots juries, sitting in criminal cases, consist of fifteen jurors, which is three more than is typical in many countries.|$|E

500|$|From 1996, {{the website}} of the Colchester tourist board {{attributed}} {{the origin of}} the rhyme to a cannon recorded as used from the church of St Mary-at-the-Wall by the Royalist defenders in the siege of 1648. In 1648, Colchester was a walled town with a castle and several churches and was protected by the city wall. The story given was that a large cannon, which the website claimed was colloquially called Humpty Dumpty, was strategically placed on the wall. A shot from a Parliamentary cannon succeeded in damaging the wall beneath Humpty Dumpty which caused the cannon to tumble to the ground. The Royalists (or Cavaliers, [...] "all the King's men") attempted to raise Humpty Dumpty on {{to another part of the}} wall, but the cannon was so heavy that [...] "All the King's horses and all the King's men couldn't put Humpty together again". Author Albert Jack claimed in his 2008 book Pop Goes the Weasel: The Secret Meanings of Nursery Rhymes that there were two other verses supporting this claim. Elsewhere, he claimed to have found them in an [...] "old dusty library, [...] an even older book", but did not state what the book was <b>or</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> was found. It has been pointed out that the two additional verses are not in the style of the seventeenth century or of the existing rhyme, and that they do not fit with the earliest printed versions of the rhyme, which do not mention horses and men.|$|E
500|$|The trust {{must then}} be {{formally}} constituted, by {{the transfer of}} its property to the trustees. For chattels, merely handing the property to the trustees is sufficient, assuming it comes with the relevant intention to create a trust. In some circumstances, providing the intention and telling the trustees {{where to find the}} property is sufficient, as in Thomas v Times Books. Where the property is land or an equitable interest in land, it must be transferred by writing in accordance with Sections 52-3 of the Law of Property Act 1925. When dealing with shares, the transfer is not complete until a transfer document has been completed and the company has entered the change of ownership in its books. One of the equitable maxims is that [...] "equity will not assist a volunteer"; if someone does not have an interest in property, they cannot bring a court case. When trusts are not properly constituted, the trustees and beneficiaries have no equitable interest in the property, and so are volunteers. There are several exceptions to this maxim. The courts are willing to hear cases where the transfer was not completed, providing the intended beneficiaries or trustees have gained an interest through being made executor of the settlor's estate (the rule in Strong v Bird), or the gift was given donatio mortis causa, or where the settlor did all he could do, as in Re Rose, <b>or</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> would be [...] "unconscionable" [...] to hold the gift invalid, as in Pennington v Waine.|$|E
