In {{advance of the}} 2011 legislative session, he unsuccessfully ran for the <b>open</b> <b>set</b> of Senate Democratic floor leader, losing to R. J. Palmer of Winchester. Carroll blamed his contentious relationship with Senate President David L. Williams as the reason his colleagues were hesitant to choose him for the post. On November 6, 2012, he defeated Republican Frank Haynes to retain his seat for another four years. He was re-elected without {{opposition in}} 2016 from a district now comprising Anderson, Woodford, Franklin, Owen and Gallatin counties. His term expires December 31, 2019.|$|E
5|$|Gregory House, M.D., often {{construed}} as a misanthropic medical genius, heads a team of diagnosticians at the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey. Most episodes revolve around the diagnosis of a primary patient and start with a cold <b>open</b> <b>set</b> outside the hospital, showing events ending {{with the onset of}} the patient's symptoms. The typical episode follows the team in their attempts to diagnose and treat the patient's illness, which often fail until the patient's condition is critical. They usually treat only patients whom other doctors have not accurately diagnosed, and House routinely rejects cases that he does not find interesting. The story lines tend to focus on his unconventional medical theories and practices, and on the other characters' reactions to them, rather than on the details of the treatments.|$|E

25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{concepts in}} point-set topology are continuity, compactness, and connectedness. Intuitively, continuous functions take nearby points to nearby points.

The words nearby, arbitrarily small, and far apart can all be made precise by using open sets. If we change the definition of <b>open</b> <b>set,</b> we change what continuous functions, compact sets, and connected sets are.

25|$|In mathematics, a sheaf is a {{tool for}} {{systematically}} tracking locally defined data attached to the open sets of a topological space. The data can be restricted to smaller open sets, and the data assigned to an <b>open</b> <b>set</b> is equivalent to all collections of compatible data assigned to collections of smaller open sets covering the original one. For example, such data can consist of the rings of continuous or smooth real-valued functions defined on each <b>open</b> <b>set.</b> Sheaves are by design quite general and abstract objects, and their correct definition is rather technical. They are variously defined, for example, as sheaves of sets or sheaves of rings, {{depending on the type}} of data assigned to open sets.|$|E
