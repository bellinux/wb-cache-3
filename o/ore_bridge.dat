50|$|In 2014 Formosa Plastics {{reached an}} {{agreement}} to invest $1.15 billion to acquire approximately one third of Fortescue Metals Group's Iron <b>Ore</b> <b>Bridge</b> project in western Australia, together with a $123 million investment into a related port project.|$|E
50|$|In 1904, Heyl & Patterson {{pioneered the}} first cranes to lift entire {{railroad}} cars, {{as well as}} towers to unload barges filled with ore, coal, sand, and slag. 1905 saw the introduction of coal crushers, coke preparation plants, coal handling bridges and mine car dumpers. 1908 saw the first skip hoists and <b>ore</b> <b>bridges</b> to transfer material at steel mills.|$|R
5|$|Modern {{furnaces}} {{are equipped}} {{with an array of}} supporting facilities to increase efficiency, such as ore storage yards where barges are unloaded. The raw materials are transferred to the stockhouse complex by <b>ore</b> <b>bridges,</b> or rail hoppers and ore transfer cars. Rail-mounted scale cars or computer controlled weight hoppers weigh out the various raw materials to yield the desired hot metal and slag chemistry. The raw materials are brought {{to the top of the}} blast furnace via a skip car powered by winches or conveyor belts.|$|R
50|$|The only {{surviving}} structure {{from the}} Tooele smelter site is an <b>ore</b> conveyor <b>bridge,</b> which was dismantled and rebuilt into a sky bridge at the Trolley Square mall in Salt Lake City. The bridge passes over 600 South, {{with a small}} informational placard near it in the mall detailing its history.|$|R
5000|$|The 06:47 {{train from}} <b>Ore</b> to London <b>Bridge</b> {{was made of}} 12 coaches from two {{electric}} multiple units, formed by a 6PUL unit 3014 and a 6PAN unit 3032.|$|R
50|$|Another {{prominent}} {{feature of}} Trolley Square is the sky bridge {{that connects the}} main building to a small parking lot located across the street. The bridge was made from a salvaged <b>ore</b> conveyor <b>bridge</b> formerly in use at the International Smelting and Refining Company facility in Tooele, Utah. The bridge goes over 600 South, and it features neon lights shaped {{in the form of}} a trolley.|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} only one railway {{accident}} in Eastbourne. On 25 August 1958, a Glasgow to Eastbourne sleeper train collided with an <b>Ore</b> to London <b>Bridge</b> service killing 5, leaving 22 with serious injuries and 18 with minor.|$|R

5000|$|By 1960, {{the area}} around Water Street had been {{acquired}} by the city via eminent domain to build the Westinghouse Building, and this necessitated an eventual move to Parkway Center in the Pittsburgh suburb of Greentree, as the very first tenant. Heyl & Patterson participated in a high-profile project for the Public Auditorium Authority of Pittsburgh - the Civic Arena. Applying technology normally used for <b>ore</b> <b>bridges</b> and other bulk material handling machines, Heyl & Patterson designed and manufactured the trucks, gear motors and 480-volt AC motor drive that opened and closed the arena roof. A total of 42 trucks mounted on 78 wheels, 30 of which were individually driven, supported and moved the six moveable sections on the largest stainless steel dome in the world. [...] In 1961, Heyl & Patterson opened its Florida Operations Division with an office and fabrication plant on Merritt Island near Cocoa Beach, Florida, {{at the entrance to}} Kennedy Space Center. Florida Operations would serve the aerospace community at Cape Canaveral, and developed a system of blast deflectors for the space program launch pads. Later in the decade, Heyl & Patterson opened a Service Center in Charleston, West Virginia as a warehouse to stock spare parts.|$|R

50|$|The {{history of}} mining in Arigna {{goes back to}} the 1700s, where coal was {{extracted}} from one of the narrowest seams known. Opened in the 1600s by Charles Coote, it changed ownership many times, including the United Irishmen the O'Reilly brothers, and then by local families. The coal was extracted originally for use in the processing of iron ore, as both nearby Sliabh an Iarainn and the Arigna River contain deposits the <b>ore.</b> Dublin's Ha'penny <b>Bridge</b> is made of Arigna iron. The mine served a purpose-built ESB station, which closed with the mine, when in 1992 the coal ran out.|$|R
50|$|County Route 527A (also {{known as}} County Route 527 Alternate or CR 527A) is a county highway in Monmouth County, New Jersey. The highway extends about 6 mi from Sweetmans Lane (County Routes 527 and 1) in Carrs Corner, New Jersey, {{on the border}} of Millstone and Manalapan townships, {{following}} Woodville Road, Iron <b>Ore</b> Road, High <b>Bridge</b> Road, and South Main Street to Park Avenue / South Main Street in Englishtown. It crosses Route 33 about halfway between its two termini. Near its northern terminus, CR 527A formerly followed Iron Ore Road to its end at Millhurst Road (CR 527) in Manalapan, but in late 2015, a jurisdiction swap between Monmouth County and Manalapan / Englishtown routed the county road on a straighter course into the borough.|$|R
500|$|Several ferries {{crossed the}} Potomac River at Point of Rocks {{before the first}} bridge was {{constructed}} there in 1852. [...] This wooden bridge was constructed to carry a double-track narrow gauge railroad from a junction with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to a blast furnace to process the area's iron <b>ore.</b> [...] This <b>bridge,</b> which also carried wagons and horses, was destroyed on June 9, 1861 by Confederate forces under General Turner Ashby, {{the same day the}} bridge at Brunswick was destroyed. [...] The second bridge at Point of Rocks was an iron bridge constructed in 1889. [...] US15 originally followed Commerce Street and Canal Road, which is now used to access the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park, through an at-grade crossing of the B Railroad to the Maryland end of the bridge, which crossed the river immediately to the east of the modern bridge. [...] The 1889 iron bridge was swept away in the March 1936 flood that also destroyed the Potomac River crossings at Harpers Ferry, Shepherdstown, and Hancock.|$|R
40|$|Imprinted Au {{nanoparticle}} (NP) composites are assembled on Au surfaces by the electropolymerization of thioaniline-functionalized Au NPs in {{the presence}} of the imprint molecules, picric acid (1), N,N'-dimethyl- 4, 4 '-bipyridinium (2), and N,N'-dimethylbipyridinium- 4, 4 '-ethylene dichloride (3). The existence of pi-donor acceptor complexes between the substrates (1 - 3) and the pi-donor thioaniline units associated with the Au NPs or the pi-donor bis-aniline bridges cross-linking the Au NPs on the electrode surfaces led to the formation of the imprinted sites. Upon elimination of the electron acceptors (1 - 3) from the Au NP matrices, molecular contours for the selective binding of the respective substrates are generated. The bis-aniline bridges linking the Au NPs in the composite exhibit quasireversible redox properties. At E 0. 12 V vs Ag <b>ORE,</b> the <b>bridging</b> units exist in the quinoid, pi-acceptor state. As a result, the potential-induced uptake and release of any of the pi-acceptor substrates 1 3 is accomplished. While at E 0. 12 V, the bound substrates are released from the matrices, due to transformation of the bridging units to the quinoid pi-acceptor state, which lacks binding affinity for the substrates. The binding and release of the substrates 1 - 3 to and from the Au NP composites are followed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, and the quantitative assay of the uptake and release is monitored by the extent of fluorescence quenching of the solution-soluble fluorescent labels, meso-tetramethyl pyridinium porphyrin (TMPyP(4 +)) or Zn(II) -meso-tetraphenylsulfonatoporphyrin (Zn-TPPS(4 -)). The electrostimulated functions of the Au NP "sponges" are controlled by several means: (i) Imprinting of the molecular contours for 1 - 3 in the Au NP composites generates high-affinity binding sites for the imprinted substrates. This leads to higher contents of the bound substrates at the Au NP sponges, as compared to the nonimprinted Au NP composites, and to an impressive selectivity in the association of the imprinted substrates. (ii) The binding capacity of the Au NP composites is substantially improved by the electrosynthesis of the matrices on a rough Pt black support bound to the base Au electrode...|$|R
