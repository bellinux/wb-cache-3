The new paste B shows lower contact resistance than paste A on conventional <b>emitters</b> of sheet <b>resistances</b> Rsh = 60 w/sq and 100 w/sq {{as well as for}} selective emitters with Rsh,se = 20 w/sq. Paste B achieves a contact resistance ρc = 3 mwcm 2 on high <b>ohmic</b> <b>emitters</b> with Rsh = 100 w/sq. Initial investigations demonstrate different contact formations for the two pastes. Paste B shows a higher density of silver crystallites grown in the silicon emitter compared to paste A for the lowly doped emitter with Rsh = 100 w/sq. Additionally, the glass layer at the interface between the front grid of paste B and the investigated emitters contains a high density of silver colloids. The high density of Ag-crystallites and Ag-colloids, the weaker glass frits aggressivity, as well as the different formation of glass layer accompany the better contacting features of paste B on high <b>ohmic</b> <b>emitters...</b>|$|R

Unfortunately, {{the only way to}} contact them by screen printing is using the selective emitter technology. This study shows that contacting emitters with Rsh = 100 Ω/sq can be achieved by standard screen printing technology without selective emitter processing thanks {{to the development of a}} new silver paste. Thus, no additional process steps are needed to selectively dope the emitter. We study the electrical properties of industrially processed c-Si solar cells, with two different screen printing silver pastes (Pastes A and B) and <b>emitters</b> with sheet <b>resistances</b> Rsh = 80 Ω/sq, 100 Ω/sq, and laser doped selective emitter with Rsh = 20 Ω/sq on Rsh = 100 Ω/sq. On the solar cells with 80 Ω/sq emitter, paste B yields a low series resistance Rs = 0. 72 Ω cm 2, thanks to its lower contact resistance ρc and its lower penetration into the space charge region, compared to paste A. The low series resistance leads to an efficiency gain Δη = 0. 7 %abs. We also obtain promising results on 100 Ω/sq, as the contact resistance ρc ≤ 3. 1 mΩcm 2 leads to a maximum ﬁll factor FF = 78. 8 %. The efficiency η = 18. 3 % of the 100 Ω/sq emitter solar cells is then comparable to the one of the selective emitter cells. With paste B, we demonstrate that it is now possible to contact high <b>ohmic</b> <b>emitters,</b> without the use of a selective emitter structure...|$|R

Emitter contact deposition in an UHV-compatible LPCVD cluster tool is also compared with deposition in a LPCVD furnace. TEM and SIMS are used to characterise the emitter contact material and the interface structure and a comparison is made with Gummel plots and <b>emitter</b> <b>resistances</b> on bipolar transistors. The SIMS results show that an in-situ hydrogen bake in a cluster tool gives an extremely low oxygen dose at the interface of 6. 3 E 13 cm- 2, compared with 7. 7 E 14 and 2. 9 E 15 cm- 2 for an ex-situ HF etch and deposition in a cluster tool or a LPCVD furnace respectively. TEM shows that the in-situ hydrogen bake results in single-crystal silicon with a high density of defects, including dislocations and twins. The ex-situ HF etch gives polycrystalline silicon for deposition in both a cluster tool and a LPCVD furnace.
