40|$|The {{behaviour}} of a double-pipe arrangement, {{consisting of}} a hot supply pipe and a warm <b>return</b> <b>pipe</b> enclosed within a relatively cold, rectangular, air-filled trench was considered. The minimum rates of steady-state heat losses occurred with the supply and the <b>return</b> <b>pipes</b> at displacement ratios Es = 0 Â· 45 and Er = - 0 Â· 38 respectively; the hot pipe being in the upper region and the warm pipe vertically below it.

There is an optimal separation of 11 Â· 4 mm Â± 1 Â· 1 mm for the gap between the supply and the <b>return</b> <b>pipes</b> for the temperature ranges and component sizes employed. This interesting result agrees quantitatively with those from previous experimental studies, but its significance had not been realised previously.

40|$|Experimental and {{numerical}} investigations {{were carried}} out on air-filled cavities containing heated inner cylinders. The effect of varying the position of radial spacers on a single cylinder was studied. It was concluded that for central positioning of the cylinder within the cavity. the rate of heat-transfer was minimised at a radial spacer angle of 480 (measured from the vertically downwards radius vector). When the cylinder was positioned at displacement ratio of 0. 7, the rate of heat-transfer was minimised at a corresponding spacer angle of 520. The corresponding reductions in the total rate of heat-transfer {{were found to be}} 25 % and 31 % less than that obtained for the system with no spacers at a cylinder displacement ratio of zero. Following this research investigation, the behaviour of a two-pipe arrangement, consisting of a hot supply and cooler <b>return</b> <b>pipe</b> within a rectangular sectioned cavity, was studied. Eccentric positioning of both supply and <b>return</b> <b>pipes</b> showed that minimum rates of heat-transfer occur at supply and <b>return</b> <b>pipe</b> displacement ratios of 0. 45 and - 0. 33 respectively. This value of heat-transfer is approximately 20 % less than that obtained for a system where supply and <b>return</b> <b>pipe</b> displacement ratios are 0. 7 and zero respectively. As experimental testing has proved to be excessively time consuming (e. g. due to having to wait until a steady-state ensued before measurments were taken) and laborious, a finite-element numerical model was developed and used to predict the heat-transfer between a heated inner cylinder and a cooled outer square duct. This study investigated eccentricity effects on the rate of heat-transfer for different ratios of duct height to cylinder radius. Solutions were obtained for Rayleigh numbers 1 to 300 and optimal pipe eccentricity for minimum heat-transfer was predicted. These predictions were in good agreement with previous experimental results...|$|R

25|$|Compared to filters {{that hang}} {{on the back of}} the aquarium, canister-style {{external}} filters offer a greater quantity of filter materials to be used along with a greater degree of flexibility with respect to filter material choice. Water enters the canister filled with the chosen filter material through an intake pipe at the bottom of the canister, passes through the material, and is fed back to the aquarium through the <b>return</b> <b>pipe.</b> Water is forced to circulate through the filter by a pump typically installed at the top of the canister. It is important to note that canister filters are sealed, fully flooded systems, meaning that the aquarium, intake pipe, filter interior and the <b>return</b> <b>pipe</b> form a continuous body of water. In this configuration both the intake and return path form two siphons, which precisely counterbalance each other. Under these circumstances, the filter pump does not have to spend any effort to lift the water back to the aquarium, regardless of how high the latter is installed above the canister. The pump should only be powerful enough to push the water through the filtering material as well as overcome the drag in the intake and <b>return</b> <b>pipes.</b> This makes canister filter pumps virtually insensitive to the height difference between the aquarium and the filter (although exceeding the manufacturer-specified height limit can lead to leaks).|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{lubrication}} failures at the shoe/swash plate contact {{of automotive}} swash plate compressors will greatly enhance {{the reliability of}} the air conditioning system. Maintaining proper lubrication is not always possible during transient conditions. Therefore, a method for detection of lubricant loss is of great interest to the automotive industry. Three methods for detecting lubrication loss were examined: contact resistance, acoustic emission, and dynamic pressure oscillations. A mobile air conditioning test stand capable of recording many system parameters was used. <b>Oil</b> <b>return</b> to the compressor was monitored using an oil separator and a refrigerant/oil concentration sensor. Data were taken during steady <b>oil</b> <b>return</b> rates and after oil shut off. The electrical contact resistance between the shoe and swashplate was used to indicate changes in the lubrication conditions at this critical interface. Measurements were taken at two <b>oil</b> <b>return</b> rates, during steady <b>oil</b> <b>return</b> tests. Preliminary results show that the minimum contact resistance is independent of the steady oil flow rates tested. In addition to the contact resistance, an acoustic emission (AE) sensor and a dynamic pressure transducer (DPX) were used to monitor oil film breakdown after oil shut off. Preliminary data indicate that the DPX may be an early indicator of low oil circulation.

30|$|By {{comparing}} Figures  14 and 15, one can {{see that}} when the piston rod is not subjected to a partial load, the oil is diffused to {{the periphery of the}} oil chamber in an elliptical shape. When the piston rod is subjected to a partial load, the oil is diffused into a square shape and the pressure in the <b>oil</b> <b>return</b> groove is low. Additionally, the pressure around the oil chamber gradually decreases and the pressure cloud map changes from orange to yellow, light green, and light blue in sequence. The pressure drop gradient is large and the pressure drop is significant. This is because the gap between the piston rod and sealing oil edge is reduced when the rod is subjected to a partial load. The oil in the oil chamber experiences increased resistance through the <b>return</b> <b>oil</b> gap and the <b>return</b> <b>oil</b> flow rate decreases. Therefore, the pressure in the <b>return</b> <b>oil</b> groove is lower than that without a partial load.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} {{presented}} in this paper is an experimental investigation of the <b>oil</b> <b>return</b> characteristics of alternative refrigerants for residential air conditioning systems using R 22. Due to the phase-out of HCFC refrigerants, the production of R 22 will be stopped by the year 2020. In some cases of vapor compression systems installed in the field, {{it will be necessary to}} replace the R 22 with alternative drop-in refrigerants as a part of maintenance procedures. Since R 22 system typically use mineral oils and HFC replacement refrigerants use POE or PAG oils. It may be necessary to change the type of oil used inside the system when retrofitting an existing R 22 system with an alternative drop-in refrigerant. Changing the oil in a vapor compression system is an expensive proposition due to the required flushing and cleaning of the system before the new oil can be installed. Therefore, refrigerant manufacturers are searching for alternative refrigerants, which are compatible with mineral oils and have similar working performance and conditions as R 22. The measurement of the <b>oil</b> <b>return</b> in the suction line helps to draw conclusions about the ability of the oil circulating back to the compressor.

Chapter 1 compares the effects of changes in <b>oil</b> price <b>return</b> and its volatility on equity returns and volatility across sectors. The findings of this chapter show that despite the GCC states dependency on oil revenues, equity market performance at the sectoral level do not exactly associate with oil movements. Our results, in particular, show that the GCC stock markets do not always move hand-in-hand with oil market movements. In chapter 2, we explore the relationship within a specific sector, i. e.
