5|$|After {{parts of}} two {{seasons in the}} Deutsche Eishockey Liga with Augsburger Panther, Caporusso joined fellow German club, Iserlohn Roosters on a one-year {{contract}} on June 12, 2015. In the 2016–17 season with the Roosters, his second year in Iserlohn, Caporusso played on the top two scoring lines finishing 3rd in scoring with 29 points in 42 games as Iserlohn finished out of playoff contention. On March 3, 2017, {{it was announced that}} Caporusso would not re-new his contract with the club to seek <b>other</b> <b>opportunities</b> in Europe.|$|E
5|$|From March 2007 until November 2012, Folding@home took {{advantage}} of the computing power of PlayStation 3s. At the time of its inception, its main streaming Cell processor delivered a 20x speed increase over PCs for some calculations, processing power which could not be found on other systems such as the Xbox 360. The PS3's high speed and efficiency introduced <b>other</b> <b>opportunities</b> for worthwhile optimizations according to Amdahl's law, and significantly changed the tradeoff between computing efficiency and overall accuracy, allowing the use of more complex molecular models at little added computing cost. This allowed Folding@home to run biomedical calculations that would have been otherwise infeasible computationally.|$|E
5|$|The {{first phase}} of {{construction}} (Phase II) had been contracted {{to be completed by}} March 2008. This would enable Morningstar, Inc. to move before its early 2009 lease expiration at its present location, 225 W. Wacker Drive. However, financial troubles have caused delays that have necessitated that Morningstar who had intended to occupy over half of the building seek lease proposals from other downtown office towers. Morningstar would suffer holdover penalties and other damages if it were unable to move before its lease expires. Morningstar is hesitant to pursue <b>other</b> <b>opportunities</b> because their lease at 108 North State Street is at a below market price in the low $20s/square foot.|$|E

5|$|Life for the blue-collar men of {{the port}} is {{increasingly}} hard and work is scarce. As union leader, Sobotka has taken it on himself to reinvigorate the port by lobbying politicians to support much-needed infrastructure improvement initiatives. Lacking the funds needed {{for this kind of}} influence, Sobotka has become involved with a smuggling ring. Around him, his son and nephew also turn to crime, as they have few <b>other</b> <b>opportunities</b> to earn money. It becomes clear to the Sobotka detail that the dead girls are related to their investigation, as they were in a container {{that was supposed to be}} smuggled through the port. They again use wiretaps to infiltrate the crime ring and slowly work their way up the chain towards The Greek, the mysterious man in charge. But Valchek, upset that their focus has moved beyond Sobotka, gets the FBI involved. The Greek has a mole inside the FBI and starts severing his ties to Baltimore when he learns about the investigation.|$|E
5|$|The company's {{latest project}} is Journey, which was {{released}} on March 13, 2012. It was the final game in Thatgamecompany's three-game contract with Sony, and was developed {{by a team of}} fourteen. This team did not include Santiago, who, in order to concentrate on her role as the company's president, was replaced as a producer by Robin Hunicke. The game was in development for three years, despite having been expected to take one year, and the development team faced several problems in expanding the company from seven employees as they began the game to eighteen, and risked running out of money. Upon release, the game achieved both critical and commercial success. It became the fastest-selling game to date on PlayStation Store in North America and Europe. After the game was released, as the company began work on another project, several employees left for <b>other</b> <b>opportunities.</b> Santiago left the company to pursue other ventures, designer Chris Bell left to form his own studio The Willderness, and Hunicke resigned to work at Tiny Speck. Chen attributes the exodus to the end of Thatgamecompany's three-game contract, and {{to the fact that the}} company had run out of money to pay employees, mandating an unpaid hiatus until the revenue from Journey came in.|$|E
