Because of large controversy of shale gaze exploitation perspective in Romania, we consider of high interest to emphasize, a methodology for quantifying the carbon footprint of the methane resulted from shale gaze exploitation. In context of analyzing the relatively new unconventional energy resource as shale gaze exploitations, we are mentioning the American literature, who shows that 3. 6 %- 7. 9 % of the methane from shale-gas production escapes to the atmosphere in venting and leaks over the lifetime of a well. The methodology, we analyze, takes into account direct emissions of CO 2 from end uses consumption, indirect emissions of CO 2 from fossil fuels used to extract, develop, and transport the gas, methane fugitive emissions, venting and equipment leaks, in accordance with steps recommended by the Organization Environmental Footprint (<b>OEF)</b> <b>Guide.</b> The source of examples is EPA emissions report 2010. An important step for responsible management, of this new approached perspective of energy producing in Romania, is to take into consideration all issues that could contribute to environmental safety, and among these the calculation of the carbon footprint is of interest, due to the important details it supplies...|$|E
40|$|The Environmental Footprint (EF), {{launched}} by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre in close cooperation with Directorate-General for the Environment, gives specific guidance for comprehensive, scientifically-sound and consistent environmental assessment of products and organisations. The EF rules are reported in two guidance documents: one applicable to all goods and services, the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) guide, and one to organisations, the Organisation Environmental Footprint (<b>OEF)</b> <b>guide.</b> The principal aim of the EF guides is to ensure science-based decision support for industry and policy. To make the general-level EF rules more relevant and applicable to specific product categories and sectors the EF guides provide requirements to develop so called PEF Category Rules (PEFCRs) and OEF Sectoral Rules (OEFSRs). PEFCRs and OEFSRs are seen as crucial especially for consistent and robust business-to-business (B 2 B) and business-to-consumer (B 2 C) communication intended {{to be used for}} comparisons. The focus of this paper is on the PEFCRs. It highlights the key challenges in the process to develop PEFCRs and takes into account amongst others recent developments led by the US EPA in this area. When developing PEFCRs, the appropriate scope of the product category needs to be defined sufficiently broad to enable meaningful comparisons of products providing the same function on the one side, while remaining focused enough to be manageable from a process point of view on the other side. Different approaches can be used such as 1) a need-based approach 2) a functional approach and 3) a material-based approach. Each of these approaches has pros and cons which are also discussed in this contribution. An example of a very wide product group is the food products. The ENVIFOOD protocol of the European Food Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) Round Table was developed to be also in line with the PEF and can serve as a starting point to develop PEFCRs for food and food packaging defining several product categories and related PEFCRs below the level of the ENVIFOOD protocol.

40|$|The ENVIFOOD Protocol is a {{food and}} drink-specific {{guidance}} document {{created by the}} European Food Sustainable Consumption and Production Roundtable, a multi stakeholder initiative co-chaired by the European Commission and business associations from the food and beverage supply chains. The Protocol has been published in November 2013 and shall {{be used as a}} complementary guidance to the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) and Organizational Environmental Footprint (<b>OEF)</b> <b>guides</b> in the PEF/OEF pilot testing launched by the European Commission. This paper describes the process of creating the ENVIFOOD Protocol as a consensus guidance document from the European food supply chain partners, and describes the key outcomes of the two public testing periods organized in 2013. Finally, we explain how the ENVIFOOD protocol is expected to be used as part of the PEF/OEF pilot testing, and the role it may play outside the application of the PEF/OEF guides. JRC.

40|$|Purpose: The {{presented}} EC Organisation Environmental Footprint (OEF) measures {{environmental impacts}} of organisations based on a life cycle approach to ensure no important issues are overlooked both throughout the value chain and regarding relevant environmental areas. It is responding to various policy requests to “establish a common methodological approach to enable Member States {{and the private sector}} to assess, display and benchmark the environmental performance of products, services and companies based on a comprehensive assessment of environmental impacts over the life-cycle ('environmental footprint') ”. Methods: The OEF provides the possibility for a more “top down” approach versus a product related approach like the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF), making data collection easier and requiring less effort. The ongoing three year pilot phase ending 2016 will explore the possibilities to develop more specific Organisation Environmental Footprint Sector Rules (OEFSRs). Results and discussion: The Organisation Environmental Footprint Sector Rules (OEFSRs) will lead to increased specificity, relevance and robustness of the assessments {{while at the same time}} striving for simplifications versus the <b>OEF</b> general <b>guide.</b> Simplification can be achieved e. g. by pre-identifying relevant life cycle stages, purchased products and environmental impacts on a sector specific level, focusing the work on what matters most. Conclusions: The three year pilot phase is a true pilot, especially for the OEF and OEFSR developments as far less experience is available compared to the assessment of products. This also and especially applies to the question if and how far comparability between organisations within the same sector providing similar products and services to society can be achieved. Considerations on whether to take any policy action is expected to take place in 2017 - 18 based on the result of the pilots and their peer review and evaluationJRC.

40|$|After {{its debut}} in the European Commission’s Integrated Product Policy (COM (2003) 302) as the “best {{framework}} for assessing the potential environmental impacts of products”, Life Cycle Thinking (LCT) and Assessment (LCA) has become increasingly used in support of community policies and business. Focus has been primarily on establishing agreed methods, both within Europe and internationally. The EC’s European Platform on Life Cycle Assessment (EPLCA) has continued to address the equally essential issue of data availability, coherence, and quality assurance. LCA has become an important approach to boost smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in the EU. As an example, {{in the context of}} the Europe 2020 Flagship Initiative “A Resource Efficient Europe”, and the “Single Market for Green Products Communication” and related European Commission Recommendation for the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) Guide and the Organisation Environmental Footprint (<b>OEF)</b> <b>Guides.</b> These methodologies reflect a vital milestone in the aim to increase coherence and quality in the assessment of environmental performance of products and organisations. Other prominent applications include in support of the Waste Framework Directive, the Eco-design Directive, EU Ecolabel and EU GPP, the Raw Materials Initiative, the bio economy strategy, as well as providing a more advanced basis for indicators and targets accounting for the burdens of EU imports and exports to help focus policies and research funding. Life Cycle Thinking is essential in modern decision making in business and policy. Commonly implemented through Life Cycle Assessment, it is increasingly necessary to quantify the benefits and burdens associated with products, both goods and services, that occur in their supply chains, during use, as well as at the end-of-their lives. This helps to avoid the shifting of burdens between different geographic regions, generations and impacts. Within this framework, the EPLCA, developed by the JRC, together with DG-Environment, represents the reference point for data and methods essential to implementing Life Cycle based approaches. The EPLCA promotes the availability of data and information, with a focus on coherence and quality assurance. Although methodology development is advancing fast, the availability of coherent, quality-assured life cycle data and studies still represents a major challenge to mainstream the use of LCA and associated environmental footprint methods in business and in policy. To date, the EPLCA has facilitated several notable developments: -	The Life Cycle Data Network (LCDN); launched in early 2014, aims at providing a globally usable infrastructure for consistent and quality assured life cycle data. -	The European Reference Life Cycle Database (ELCD); comprises of Life Cycle emissions and resource consumption Inventory (LCI) data from front-running EU-level business associations and other sources for key materials, energy carriers, transport, and waste management, to be used as source for secondary data. -	The Resource Directory (RD); provides a structured repository for several types of life cycle-based documents and studies, as well as a world-wide list of life cycle support software packages and databases from suppliers/developers, and service providers. -	The Reviewer Registry (RR) : provides a list of potential reviewers for different LCA schemes, and automatically assess the eligibility of single reviewers and reviewers’ teams, according to different levels of compliance. This guide provides comprehensive instructions on how to utilize the Life Cycle Data Network (LCDN) for publishing LCA data. It summarizes how to orchestrate the various tools in order to guide the data developers through the entire process from generation of a dataset to publication on the LCDN. Further and more detailed documentation for the individual steps can be found in the annexes to this technical report. In principle, the following steps are required in order to publish data on the LCDN and therefore covered in this document: 1. 	Prepare data (export from an LCA modelling tool) 2. 	Technical validation of the data 3. 	Set up a node for participation in the LCDN. 4. 	Upload of the data to the node 5. 	Publication of the data on the LCDN Beyond that, a detailed guidance on how document different ILCD-EL aspects, in three commonly used LCA software in Europe (Namely: GaBi, OpenLCA and SimaPro), is also provided in this document. This document is providing some examples, taking into account some the above mentioned LCA software, because are the most commonly used and widespread in Europe, this does NOT imply any recommendation or endorsement from the JRC or the European Commission. An exemplary dataset was used to provide an overview and understanding of how to address some compliance issues, in different software. Some general guiding principles that apply to all of the software are summarized, along with a short review of discrepancies found when exporting the dataset in ILCD format using the individual LCA software. The editable compliance elements are explained individually, showing some screenshots of different software tools. Finally a set of slides, resuming the content of this guide, is provided in annex II. JRC. D. 1 -Bio-econom...|$|R
40|$|After {{its debut}} in the European Commission‟s Integrated Product Policy (COM (2003) 302) as the “best {{framework}} for assessing the potential environmental impacts of products”, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has become increasingly essential in support of community policies and business. Focus has been primarily on establishing agreed methods, both within Europe and internationally. The EC‟s European Platform on LCA has continued to address the equally essential issue of data availability, coherence, and quality assurance. This Roadmap document summarises the requirements of several key EC policy developments {{in the context of}} vital support needs from this Platform, presenting different options for further development. LCA has become an important approach to boost smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in the EU. As an example, {{in the context of the}} Europe 2020 Flagship Initiative “A Resource Efficient Europe”, the European Commission developed its recommendations in the Single Market for Green Products Communication for the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) Guide and the Organisation Environmental Footprint (<b>OEF)</b> <b>Guides.</b> These methodologies reflect a vital milestone in the aim to increase coherence and quality in the assessment of environmental performance of products and organisations, facilitating governments and business stakeholders in that sense. Other prominent applications include in support of the Waste Framework Directive, the Ecodesign Directive, EU Ecolabel and EU GPP, the Raw Materials Initiative, the Bio economy Strategy, as well as providing a more advanced basis for indicators and targets accounting for the burdens of EU imports and exports to help focus policies and research funding.

This helps to avoid the shifting of burdens between different geographic regions and impacts.

The Platform promotes the availability of data and information, with a focus on coherence and quality assurance. Although methodology development is advancing fast, including the provision of authoritative requirements by the European Commission, the availability of coherent, quality-assured life cycle data and studies still represent a more major challenge to mainstream use of LCA and associated environmental footprint methods in business and in policy. To date, the European Platform has facilitated several notable developments: - The International Reference Life Cycle Data System Data Network (ILCD DN); to be launched in early 2014, aims at providing a globally usable infrastructure for consistent and quality assured life cycle data. - The European Reference Life Cycle Database (ELCD); comprises of Life Cycle emissions and resource consumption Inventory (LCI) data from front-running EU-level business associations and other sources for key materials, energy carriers, transport, and waste management, to be used as source for secondary data. - The International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) Handbook; is a series of technical guidance documents that provide practice-oriented guidance on LCA; providing a key input to the Environmental Footprint developments, as well as complementary support in relation to data and other application needs. - The Resource Directory (RD); provides a structured repository for several types of life cycle-based documents and studies, as well as a world-wide list of life cycle support software packages and databases from suppliers/developers, and service providers. - The Life Cycle Thinking (LCT) Forum; acts as reference point for scholars and practitioners to discuss and share experiences on methods, data, events, etc. This tool is expected to be revised and released as a structured online public forum in the near future, in order to facilitate topic-oriented information exchange. - The Advisory Groups with business stakeholders and software developers; aim at improving the usefulness of the European Platform in the EU and international context, towards the agreement on common strategies and harmonisation. Although a lot of work has been already done, there are still several bottlenecks preventing the Platform to effectively and efficiently meet the growing needs of policy makers and other stakeholders. Seeking for synergies among tools, improving transparency and consistency of data, and populating the ELCD and ILCD DN with new relevant data are just a few examples of further development necessities. This Roadmap provides an overview of what would be required to further improve and best position the European Platform on LCA in relation to a selection of key on-going EC policy support activities required to facilitate environmental sustainability. The Roadmap specifies a number of action proposals. These actions are differentiated in the Roadmap in terms of time frame (i. e. short-mid-term describing circa 3 years starting from 2014, while the longer-term perspective represents a vision for the future evolution). Based on the availability of resources, three scenarios have been delineated to undertake to various extents these actions. In short, the first scenario assumes minor changes to the current resource availability. This scenario would address only the most important needs, detected as transversal across the different EU projects and policies involved, including only the strictly necessary improvements. According to the second scenario, slightly increased investments will be needed. Given the current situation, this scenario seems to be the minimum-effort scenario to improve the Platform in a timely manner. This scenario entails, among others, the expansion of the data and information support tools needed to e. g. ensure the smooth implementation of the Environmental Footprint method; amongst other policy and business support needs of the community. With major additional investment into the Platform, very important goals could be achieved in a fast-track manner. Through this third scenario, the Platform could become the most important reference point for all the life cycle based activities in the EU, facilitating interactions among stakeholders, policy makers and practitioners, and creating synergies for data exchange between the European Commission, other EU institutions, member-states and other non-governmental organizations. edition: 1 nrpages: 67 status: publishe...|$|R
