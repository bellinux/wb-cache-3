40|$|Using {{data from}} 62 {{automobile}} assembly plants worldwide, {{we examine the}} extent to which various structural cost drivers (plant scale, automation, and product mix complexity) and exe-cutionalcost drivers (product manufacturability, management policies, and production practices) account for plant-level differences in manufacturing overhead. Our analysis of structural drivers finds that <b>overhead</b> <b>hours</b> per vehicle are negatively associated with production volumes, consistent with economies of scale in overhead functions. However, automation appears to have little influence on overhead levels. Product mix complexity’s effect on overhead requirements varies with the complexity’s form and the plant’s manufacturing capabilities. Option and parts complexity (mea-sures of peripheral and intermediate product variety) both exhibit adverse effects on overhead, reflecting the considerable logistical, coordination, and supervisory challenges that accompany an increased number of parts and more complex manufacturing tasks. In contrast, model mix complexity (a measure of fundamental variety) appears to have little impact on direct or overhead labor requirements in auto assembly plants. Our analysis of executional drivers provides empirical support for the claim that advanced manufacturing practices such as the reduction of buffers, multiskilled production workers, and the use of teams can lower overhead costs. We also fin...|$|E
40|$|We report {{results from}} a multi-year {{empirical}} study {{on the impact of}} product variety on automobile assembly plant productivity. Three sources of data were used to examine the research questions and triangulate the findings. First, we conducted field research in more than 20 assembly plants worldwide to study how they cope with product variety through manufacturing flexibility. Second, using time series and cross-sectional data from GM's Wilmington, Delaware plant, we examined the effects of product variety and the variability in work content per car on various performance measures. Consistent with the field evidence, the time series analyses indicated that greater variability in option content has a statistically significant adverse impact on total labor hours per car produced, <b>overhead</b> <b>hours</b> per car produced, downtime in the assembly line, minor repair and major rework, and inventory as a percentage of cost of sales. We also found that work stations with higher variability in option content have significantly higher slack resources to protect against variety-related defects and downtime, introducing an additional fixed cost of product variety. Finally, we used simulation to measure the impact on assembly line downtime of variability in work content per car. The simulation study confirmed the results of our statistical analysis. 1...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} product variety on automobile assembly plant performance using data from GM 2 ̆ 7 s Wilmington, Delaware plant, together with simulation analyses of a more general auto assembly line. We extend prior product variety studies by providing evidence on the magnitude of variety-related production losses, the mechanisms through which variety impacts performance, {{and the effects of}} option bundling and labor staffing policies on the costs of product variety. The empirical analyses indicate that greater day-to-day variability in option content (but not mean option content per car) has a significant adverse impact on total labor hours per car produced, <b>overhead</b> <b>hours</b> per car produced, assembly line downtime, minor repair and major rework, and inventory levels, but does not have a significant short-run impact on total direct labor hours. However, workstations with higher variability in option content have greater slack direct labor resources to buffer against process time variation, introducing an additional cost of product variety. The simulation results support these findings in that once each workstation is optimally buffered against process time variation, product variety has an insignificant impact on direct assembly labor. The simulations also show that bundling options can reduce the amount of buffer capacity required, and that random variation is more pernicious to productivity than product variety, supporting the efforts of some auto makers to aggressively attack the causes of random variation...|$|E

[...] House of Commons debate, October 2007. The Short Tucano replaced the Jet Provost as the basic trainer for the RAF, preparing the student pilots for progression to Hawk T1 advanced flying training.

The Tucano's accident record has also been remarkably better than other ab-initio training aircraft, with only three aircraft written off in over 20 years.|$|R
60|$|It was {{an early}} summer evening in Mayfair, and Sir Allan Beaumerville stood {{on the balcony of}} his bijou little house, for which he had lately deserted the more stately family mansion in Grosvenor Square. There was a soft {{pleasant}} stillness in the air, and a gentle rustling of green leaves among the trees. The streets below were almost blocked with streams of carriages and hansoms, for the season was not yet over, and it was fast approaching the fashionable dinner <b>hour.</b> <b>Overhead,</b> in somewhat curious contrast, the stars were shining in a deep cloudless sky, and a golden-horned moon hung down in the west.|$|R
50|$|Overhead {{costs are}} often {{allocated}} to sets of produced goods {{based on the}} ratio of labor hours or costs or the ratio of materials used for producing the set of goods. Overhead costs may {{be referred to as}} factory overhead or factory burden for those costs incurred at the plant level or overall burden for those costs incurred at the organization level. Where labor hours are used, a burden rate or <b>overhead</b> cost per <b>hour</b> of labor may be added along with labor costs. Other methods may be used to associate overhead costs with particular goods produced. Overhead rates may be standard rates, in which case there may be variances, or may be adjusted for each set of goods produced.|$|R
6000|$|But {{the happiest}} {{and best of}} all the recollections, perhaps, are those of the hours passed at night on the deck, when the stars were shining <b>overhead,</b> and the <b>hours</b> were tolled at their time, and your {{thoughts}} were fixed upon home far away. As the sun rose I once heard the priest, from the minaret of Constantinople, crying out, [...] "Come to prayer," [...] with his shrill voice ringing through the clear air; and saw, at the same hour, the Arab prostrate himself and pray, and the Jew Rabbi, bending over his book, and worshipping the Maker of Turk and Jew. Sitting at home in London, and writing this last line of farewell, those figures come back the clearest of all to the memory, with the picture, too, of our ship sailing over the peaceful Sabbath sea, and our own prayers and services celebrated there. So each, in his fashion, and after his kind, is bowing down, and adoring the Father, who is equally above all. Cavil not, you brother or sister, if your neighbour's voice is not like yours; only hope that his words are honest (as far as they may be), and his heart humble and thankful.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—General purpose GPU (GPGPU) {{computing}} {{has produced}} the fastest running supercomputers in the world. For continued sustainable progress, GPU computing at scale also need to address two open issues: a) how increase applications {{mean time between failures}} (MTBF) as we increase supercom-puter’s component counts; and b) how to minimize unnecessary energy consumption. Since energy consumption is defined by the number of components used, we consider a sustainable high performance computing (HPC) application can allow better performance and reliability at the same time when adding computing or communication components. This paper reports a two-tier semantic statistical multiplexing framework for sustainable HPC at scale. The idea is to leverage the powers of statistic multiplexing to tame the nagging HPC scalability challenges. We include the theoretical model, sustainability analysis and computational experiments with automatic system level multiple CPU/GPU failure containment. Our results show that assuming three times slowdown of the statistical multiplexing layer, for an application using 1024 processors with 35 % checkpoint overhead, the two-tier framework will produce sustained time and energy savings for MTBF less than 6 hours. With 5 % checkpoint <b>overhead,</b> 1. 5 <b>hour</b> MTBF would be the break even point. These results suggest the practical feasibility for the proposed two-tier framework.
