The efficiency is quantified by the global fidelity for transferring coherently a qubit excitation between a single <b>optical</b> <b>photon</b> and the superconducting qubit. We test various strategies and show that the total efficiency is essentially limited by the optical quantum memory: It can exceed 80 % for ensembles of NV centers and approaches 99 % for cold atomic ensembles, assuming state-of-the-art experimental parameters.

In {{this paper}} we present the first system test {{in which we}} {{demonstrate}} the concept of using an array of Distributed Read Out Imaging Devices (DROIDs) for <b>optical</b> <b>photon</b> detection. Aims. After the successful S-Cam 3 detector {{the next step in}} the development of a cryogenic <b>optical</b> <b>photon</b> counting imaging spectrometer under the S-Cam project is to increase the field of view using DROIDs. With this modification the field of view of the camera has been increased by a factor of 5 in area, while keeping the number of readout channels the same. Methods. The test has been performed using the flexible S-Cam 3 system and exchanging the 10 x 12 Superconducting Tunnel Junction array for a 3 x 20 DROID array. The extra data reduction needed with DROIDs is performed offline. Results. We show that, although the responsivity (number of tunnelled quasiparticles per unit of absorbed photon energy, e- /eV) of the current array is too low for direct astronomical applications, the imaging quality is already good enough for pattern detection, and will improve further with increasing responsivity. Conclusions. The obtained knowledge can be used to optimise the system for the use of DROIDs. Comment: 7 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publicaiton in A&...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we study {{theoretically}} {{the efficiency of}} a travelling magnon based microwave to <b>optical</b> <b>photon</b> converter for applications in Quantum Information (QI). The converter employs an epitaxially grown yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film as the medium for propagation of travelling magnons (spin waves). The conversion is achieved through coupling of magnons to guided optical modes of the film. The total microwave to <b>optical</b> <b>photon</b> conversion efficiency {{is found to be}} larger than in a similar process employing a YIG sphere by at least 4 orders of magnitude. By creating an optical resonator of a large length from the film (such that the traveling magnon decays before forming a standing wave over the resonator length) one will be able to further increase the efficiency by several orders of magnitude, potentially reaching a value similar to achieved with opto-mechanical resonators. Also, as a spin-off result, it is shown that isolation of more that 20 dB with direct insertion losses about 5 dBm can be achieved with YIG film based microwave isolators for applications in Quantum Information. An important advantage of the suggested concept of the QI devices based on travelling spin waves is a perfectly planar geometry and a possibility of implementing a the device as a hybrid opto-microwave chip...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{this work}} we {{demonstrate}} theoretically and ex-perimentally {{the capability to}} reduce the readout noise of an optical and X-ray photon detector based on the semiconductor DEPFET device below a level of only 0. 3 e − ENC (equivalent noise charge). The readout method used is called ”Repetitive Non Destructive Readout ” (RNDR) and was realised by placing two single DEPFET-devices {{next to each other}} and by coupling their charge storing region by an additional gate. By transferring the stored charge from one DEPFET to the other and vice versa the same charge can be measured non-destructively and arbitrarily often. Taking the average value of a large number n of these measurements, the noise is reduced by 1 / n. The main advantage of such a detector is to greatly reduce the influence of the 1 /f noise to the readout noise. The theoretically and experimentally achievable resolution for different operating parameters (leakage current, readout noise, number and duration of readouts) was investigated by Monte-Carlo simulations and verified on a real RNDR minimatrix (pixelarray). Single <b>optical</b> <b>photon</b> detection with high quantum efficiency and, even more fascinating, the possibility to distinguish between different numbers of photons e. g. 100 from 101 is presented in measurements.
