50|$|Sometimes it {{is desired}} {{that a person}} can {{establish}} a long-term relationship (such as a reputation) with some <b>other</b> <b>entity,</b> without necessarily disclosing personally identifying information to that entity. In this case, {{it may be useful}} for the person to establish a unique identifier, called a pseudonym, with the <b>other</b> <b>entity.</b> Examples of pseudonyms are pen names, nicknames, credit card numbers, student numbers, bank account numbers, etc. A pseudonym enables the <b>other</b> <b>entity</b> to link different messages from the same person and, thereby, to establish a long-term relationship. Pseudonyms are widely used in social networks and other virtual communication, although recently some important service providers like Google try to discourage pseudonymity.|$|R
