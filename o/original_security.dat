In contrast to Black-Scholes or Cox-Ross-Rubinstein model the market consisting of stock and cash is not complete yet.

5000|$|An inverse {{floating}} rate note {{can be created}} two ways. The first is by placing an existing or newly underwritten fixed-rate security into a trust and issuing both a {{floating rate}} note and an inverse floating rate note. The second method is for an investment banking firm to underwrite a fixed-rate security and then enter into an interest rate swap that has a maturity less than the bond's term. The investor would then own an inverse floater until the swap agreement expires. When creating an inverse floater through the swap market the need to sell in inverse floaters through a Dutch auction is eliminated. In the first scenario the <b>original</b> <b>security</b> placed in trust {{is referred to as}} the collateral, from this collateral both the floater and inverse floater are created. The dealer will split up the underlying fixed-rate asset at a specified ratio (e.g. 20/80) and assign each portion to inverse and floater.|$|E

5000|$|A {{depositary}} receipt is a security that is {{offered as a}} [...] "tracking stock" [...] on another foreign market. For instance a Chinese company wishing to raise more money may issue a depository receipt on the New York Stock Exchange, {{as the amount of}} capital on the local exchanges is limited. These securities, known as ADRs (American {{depositary receipt}}) or GDRs (global depository receipt) depending on where they are issued, are typically considered [...] "foreign" [...] and therefore trade at a lower value when first released. Many ADR's are exchangeable into the <b>original</b> <b>security</b> (known as fungibility) and actually have the same value. In this case there is a spread between the perceived value and real value, which can be extracted. Other ADR's that are not exchangeable often have much larger spreads. Since the ADR is trading at a value lower than what it is worth, one can purchase the ADR and expect to make money as its value converges on the original. However, there is a chance that the original stock will fall in value too, so by shorting it one can hedge that risk.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a novel mutual {{authentication}} and key exchange protocol based on self-certified mechanism is proposed for roaming {{services in the}} global mobility network (GLOMONET). The main new features of the proposed protocol include identity anonymity, one-time session key renewal, and distributed security management scheme. Identity anonymity protects location privacy of mobile users in the roaming network environment. One-time session key renewal protocol frequently updates the session key for mobile users and hence {{reduces the risk of}} using a compromised session key to communicate with visited networks. The distributed security management scheme provides an efficient management mechanism: the <b>original</b> <b>security</b> manager in home network is responsible for providing local services for his mobile user whilst a temporary security manager dynamically generated for a roaming user in the visited network is in charge of providing roaming services. After certification, the temporary security manager will take the place of the <b>original</b> <b>security</b> manager when the roaming user stays in the service area of the visited network. The results of performance analysis show that the computation complexity of our protocol is not high and does satisfy the computation capacity requirement for mobile device while these new security features have been significantly enhanced. Keywords—Authentication, key exchange, roaming service, anonymity, self-certified. 1...|$|E
