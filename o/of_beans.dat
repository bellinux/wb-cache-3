Treatments included one row <b>of</b> <b>bean</b> + one row of borage (1 : 1), two rows <b>of</b> <b>bean</b> + two rows of borage (2 : 2), three rows <b>of</b> <b>bean</b> + three rows of borage (3 : 3), four rows <b>of</b> <b>bean</b> + four rows of borage (4 : 4) and pure bean and borage. Results indicated that the highest economic yield <b>of</b> <b>bean</b> and borage were achieved in monoculture with 4. 46 and 0. 12 t. ha- 1 and 4 : 4 with 2. 30 and 0. 05 t. ha- 1, respectively.

5|$|Crop {{diversity}} is {{an aspect of}} biodiversity important for food security. The loss of bio{{diversity is}} considered one of today’s most serious environmental concerns by the Food and Agriculture Organization. If current trends persist, as many as half of all plant species could face extinction. Among the many threatened species are wild relatives of our crops – the wild and weedy cousins of domesticated plants that possess valuable traits for crop breeding, such as pest and disease resistance. Some 6% of wild relatives of cereal crops such as wheat, maize, rice, and sorghum are under threat, as are 18% of legumes (Fabaceae), the wild relatives <b>of</b> <b>beans,</b> peas and lentils, and 13% of species within the botanical family (Solanaceae) that includes potato, tomato, eggplant (aubergine), and peppers (Capsicum). In 2016, 29% of wild relative plant species were completely missing from the world’s genebanks, with a further 24% represented by fewer than 10 samples. Over 70% of all crop wild relative species worldwide were in urgent need of further collecting to improve their representation in genebanks, and over 95% were insufficiently represented with regard to the full range of geographic and ecological variation in their native distributions. While the most critical priorities for further collecting were found in the Mediterranean and Near East, Western and Southern Europe, Southeast and East Asia, and South America, crop wild relatives insufficiently represented in genebanks are distributed across almost all countries worldwide.|$|E

5|$|However, modern {{agriculture}} seriously reduces biodiversity. Traditional {{third world}} agriculture that is best at maintaining diversity with multiple cropping systems such aspolyculture(includingcompanion plantingandintercropping) andagroforestrysystems such as shifting cultivation. In Latin America, between 70% and 90% <b>of</b> <b>beans</b> are grown mixed with other {{crops such as}} maize and potatoes. Worldwide, multiple cropping provided up to 20% of all food in 1986. Traditional systems also maintain diversity within a crop species, such as in theAndesmountains where up to 50 varieties of potato are grown.The effects of loss of biodiversity are especially noticeable in pest control. Herbivorous pest insects tend to become more abundant inmonocultures. Stable agroecosystems are biodiverse and contain sufficient numbers of natural enemies of crop pests, such asparasitoidalwasps which are able to controlaphidsandlepidopterancaterpillars. These ecosystems continuously provide food and breeding sites for these beneficial species. Agroecosystems can achieve this equilibrium by arranging a suitable combination of crops in space and time, given the type of soil and surrounding environment; sufficient abundance of non-crop plants in and around fields; and appropriate management of vegetation. Suitable farming strategies include polyculture,crop rotation, mosaics of small scattered fields and uncultivated land. Additional strategies include perennial crops such asorchards(especially if a diverse floral undergrowth is permitted), tolerating specific weed species, and raising genetic diversity such as by planting mixtures of crop varieties.|$|E

The beans are fed through one of the cooperative's three de-skinning and selection machines to remove their skins and most of the sugary coating before running the individual beans through a vibrating colander. The colander separates the very highest quality Grade A beans from those labeled Grade B; the two grades are sent separately down the hill in a water chute with a 1 percent gradient. This process allows for further separation <b>of</b> <b>beans</b> based on quality, with around 15 tanks available at the bottom for capture of the different types.

Five concentrations <b>of</b> <b>bean</b> flour (0 %, 0. 01 %, 0. 1 %, 1 % and 10 %) were used at 25  °C and 85  ±  5 % relative humidity (RH) under darkness.
