5|$|Espejo {{was noted}} in his time for being a satirist. His satirical works, {{inspired}} by {{the philosophy of the}} Age <b>of</b> <b>Enlightenment,</b> were critical of the lack of education of the Audiencia of Quito, the way the economy was being handled in the Audiencia, the corruption of its authorities, and aspects of its culture in general. Because of these works he was persecuted and finally imprisoned shortly before his death.|$|E
5|$|Romanticism in Scotland was an artistic, {{literary}} and intellectual movement that developed between {{the late eighteenth}} and the early nineteenth centuries. It {{was part of the}} wider European Romantic movement, which was partly a reaction against the Age <b>of</b> <b>Enlightenment,</b> emphasising individual, national and emotional responses, moving beyond Renaissance and Classicist models, particularly to the Middle Ages.|$|E

50|$|Erthal's predecessor, {{archbishop}} Emmerich Joseph von Breidbach zu Bürresheim, {{had introduced}} some ideas <b>of</b> the <b>Enlightenment,</b> {{and had been}} a popular figure. After his death, the Domkapitel was split in two fractions, one representing the openness to reform <b>of</b> the <b>Enlightenment,</b> the larger one advocating immediate restoration. Directly {{after the death of}} archbishop Emmerich Joseph, Friedrich von Erthal, then Domkustos, was charged with reducing the influence <b>of</b> the <b>Enlightenment</b> in the schools and monasteries of the archbishopric. After his election on 18 July 1774, and his election as Bishop of Worms, he assigned many opponents <b>of</b> the <b>Enlightenment</b> to important positions.|$|R

5|$|Romanticism was {{a complex}} artistic, {{literary}} and intellectual movement that {{originated in the}} second half of the eighteenth century in western Europe, and gained strength during and after the Industrial and French Revolutions. It was partly a revolt against the political norms of the Age <b>of</b> <b>Enlightenment</b> which rationalised nature, and was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature, but significantly influenced historiography, philosophy and the natural sciences.|$|E
5|$|Similarities between Assipatle's {{defeat of}} the monster and other dragon-slayer tales, {{including}} Herakles' destruction of a sea monster to save Hesione, have been noted by several authors.

40|$|In {{this article}} several new {{publications}} on the critics <b>of</b> the <b>Enlightenment</b> are reviewed. These works build {{partly on the}} legacy of Isaiah Berlin’s concept of the Counter-Enlightenment, but they also emphasise the problematic nature of his essentialistic and timeless interpretation of the Counter-Enlightenment tradition. The authors argue that the so-called enemies <b>of</b> the <b>Enlightenment</b> should in fact be examined as part <b>of</b> the <b>Enlightenment</b> itself, and that the Enlightenment cannot be understood without studying its self-proclaimed enemies...|$|R

5|$|The project, however, found strong resistance. As Carlota {{was married}} to John VI, a prince of Portugal, many people though that Carlotism was a trick to conceal Portuguese expansionism.

By 1810 the project was forgotten.|$|E

5|$|After this débâcle {{the rest}} of Richardson's stage career was at the National, with one late exception. He played Lord Touchwood in The Double Dealer (1978), the Master in The Fruits <b>of</b> <b>Enlightenment</b> (1979), Old Ekdal in The Wild Duck (1979) and Kitchen in Storey's Early Days, {{specially}} written for him. The last toured in North America after the London run. His final West End play was The Understanding (1982), a gentle comedy of late-flowering love. Celia Johnson was cast as his co-star, but died suddenly just before the first night.

5|$|As {{a form of}} Western esotericism, the New Age has antecedents {{that stretch}} back to {{southern}} Europe in Late Antiquity. Following the Age <b>of</b> <b>Enlightenment</b> in 18th century Europe, new esoteric ideas developed {{in response to the}} development of scientific rationality.

5|$|Part {{of the new}} {{genre of}} the Romantic travel narrative, History of a Six Weeks' Tour exudes spontaneity and enthusiasm; the authors {{demonstrate}} their desire to {{develop a sense of}} taste and distinguish themselves from those around them. The romantic elements of the work would have hinted at the text's radical politics to nineteenth-century readers. However, the text's frank discussion of politics, including positive references to the French Revolution and praise <b>of</b> <b>Enlightenment</b> philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, was unusual for a travel narrative at the time, particularly one authored primarily by a woman.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1785, Espejo took an {{interest}} in the welfare of his community and the prosperity of Quito. His works between that year and 1792 clearly show the influence <b>of</b> <b>Enlightenment</b> philosophers, whose ideas Espejo adapted to local conditions. As many thinkers realized the power of economics as a social force, Espejo, influenced by Feijoo and Adam Smith among others, showed his desire for commercial and agricultural reforms, especially conservation and proper use of land. To advance these ideas, he founded the Escuela de la Concordia (School of Concord).|$|E
5|$|Telescopium was {{introduced}} in 1751–52 by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille with the French name le Telescope, depicting an aerial telescope, after he had observed and catalogued 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the Cape of Good Hope. He devised 14 new constellations in uncharted regions of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere not visible from Europe. All but one honored instruments that symbolised the Age <b>of</b> <b>Enlightenment.</b> Covering 40 degrees of the night sky, the telescope stretched out northwards between Sagittarius and Scorpius.
