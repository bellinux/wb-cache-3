40|$|In this paper, I explore eight key questions: • What is learning? I want to unpick {{a single}} {{definition}} <b>of</b> <b>learning,</b> {{so that more}} precise processes can {{be considered in the}} context of potentially effective uses of technologies. • What are the ‘old’ ways <b>of</b> <b>learning?</b> If we are to accept ‘new’ ways <b>of</b> <b>learning,</b> then we also need to recognise ‘old’ ways too. • How has research explored learning? I {{want to look at the}} perspectives that have been gained from various researchers in education and educational psychology, as I believe these are important to our understanding of where technologies can be used to match those perspectives. • What are the ‘new’ ways <b>of</b> <b>learning?</b> I will outline some of the ‘new’ ways that have been identified over the past 60 or so years. • How do forms <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> and ‘new’ ways <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> relate? If we consider different perspectives <b>of</b> <b>learning,</b> and ‘new’ ways <b>of</b> <b>learning,</b> then it is possible to see how these might relate, and afford differences in terms of match. • How do educational technologies support these forms <b>of</b> <b>learning?</b> Technologies are generally produced with specific forms <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> in mind, and it is important to know how these relate so that appropriate selections can be made. • How do we measure learning? If <b>learning</b> consists <b>of</b> a range of processes, then each of those processes is likely to be able to be measured in different ways. • How do measures <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> and ‘new’ ways <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> relate?

5|$|The {{earliest}} epigraphic {{records of}} the Tamil country in Tamil Nadu were found in Mangulam village near Madurai. The cave inscriptions, deciphered in 1966, have been dated to the 2nd century BC and record the gift of a monastery by Pandyan king Nedunj Cheliyan to a Jain monk. These inscriptions are also the oldest Jain inscriptions in South India and among the oldest in all of India. References to Sangam age Chera dynasty are found in Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions of 3rd century CE found on rocks in Edakal hill in Wynad district of Kerala. The ancient port city of Thondi is mentioned in inscriptions found in Kilavalavu village near Madurai. The {{early part of the}} 20th century saw the discovery of about 39 inscriptions in a dozen locations, all near Madurai. The most significant of these were the ones at Alagarmalai and Sittannavasal. The Alagarmalai inscriptions, dated to the 1st century BCE, record the endowments made by a group of merchants from Madurai. Another set of inscriptions from the 2nd century CE, found at Pugalur village near Karur, document the construction of a rock shelter by a Chera king of the Irumporai line for a Jain monk, Cenkayapan. Cave inscriptions at Arachalur, dated to the 4th century, provide evidence for the cultivation of music and dance in the Tamil country. One of the earliest inscriptional evidence of the chieftains of the Sangam age was found at Jambai, a village near the town of Tirukkoyilur in Villupuram district of Tamil Nadu. These inscriptions belonging to the 1st century CE record the grants made by the chieftain Atiyaman Netuman Anci who ruled from Takatur. According to epigraphist I. Mahadevan, there were some reservations initially, about the linguistic details in the inscriptions, but further investigations have confirmed their authenticity. Inscriptions from the 2nd century CE found at Mannarkoil village in Tirunelveli district contain a reference to a katikai, which could mean an assembly <b>of</b> <b>learned</b> persons or an institution of higher learning. An inscription belonging to the early Cholas has been discovered near Tiruchirappalli and has been dated between the 2nd and 4th century.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} results from a study focused on the objects <b>of</b> <b>learning.</b> The aim is to analyse and {{describe}} how objects <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> are handled in three learning studies. The first question concerns how different aspects <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> is carried out {{in terms of the}} intended, enacted and lived objects <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> and their interrelations. The second question concerns the differences and similarities between an object <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> and a learning objective. The theoretical framework for the analysis of this study {{as well as for the}} planning instructions is variation theory. The theoretical assumption is that learning is always the <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> something, so as the ability to learn presupposes an experience of variation. Thus, the learner must discern variation in a dimension that corresponds to that aspect in spite of the background of invariance in other aspects of what is to be learned (i. e. the object <b>of</b> <b>learning).</b> In a classroom discourse, the teachers’ as well as the students’ activities constitute the space <b>of</b> <b>learning,</b> which refers to the learning opportunities the students are given, i. e. the enacted object <b>of</b> <b>learning.</b> The intentional object <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> describes the teachers’ intention with the lesson. The lived object <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> is what they actually <b>learn.</b> The object <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> is the compound of two aspects: the direct and the indirect object <b>of</b> <b>learning.</b> The former is defined in terms of content whereas the latter refers to the kind of capability that the students are supposed to develop. The method used is learning study, which can be seen as a hybrid between a design experiment and lesson study. A learning study is theoretically grounded which primary focus is on an object <b>of</b> <b>learning.</b> Here, the teachers and the researcher worked together and had equal status in the group. The objects <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> were chosen by the teachers. The findings should be seen as implications on students’ learning can be understood, depending on how an object <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> is constituted by a teacher in terms of the intended, enacted and lived objects <b>of</b> <b>learning.</b> Another finding is a contribution to the discussion of how teachers’ competences should be constituted...|$|R

This research used the quasi-experimental research method. The research design was a 3 × 3 factorial design.

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 What {{constitutes}} quality <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> {{in primary}} care? A social systems {{view of that}} central question regards the relationships between dimensions <b>of</b> <b>learning,</b> purposes <b>of</b> primary care, and quality of practice. The question <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> quality was approached in three ways. First, perceptions <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> quality were elicited through recorded interviews with fifteen participants representing diverse roles in a primary care medical clinic. Analysis of the interviews indicated learning sources, factors, and functional dimensions <b>of</b> <b>learning.</b> Second, because learning is constituted in a social practice, the social context <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> in primary care clinics was modeled with qualitative systems diagrams. This exposed systemic barriers and facilitators <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> in practice. Third, learning is directed toward fulfilling the purposes of primary care. The nature of those purposes is not well articulated. A framework of seven core purposes was developed {{from the perspective of}} systems phenomenology. This framework extends the biopsychosocial framework in several regards. Perceptions <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> quality, the structural situation <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> in clinical practice, and the core purposes of primary care, all contribute to a social systems understanding <b>of</b> what constitutes <b>learning</b> quality, and how primary care organizations might procure it and assess it.
