5|$|Hoffman {{was held}} in high regard within the film and theater industry, and cited in the media {{as one of the}} finest actors <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>generation.</b> Despite this status among his peers and critics, he was never {{one of the most popular}} film stars, and has been {{overlooked}} in lists of all-time greatest actors.|$|E
5|$|In February 1965, Pohl {{brought in}} Algis Budrys as book reviewer, {{after a year}} in which no review column had appeared. Budrys's {{insightful}} reviews drew much praise, and editor David Hartwell has ranked him {{as one of the best}} sf critics <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>generation.</b>|$|E

5|$|Interested {{in using}} sources other than archaeology, Grinsell {{made use of}} documents, place-names, folklore, and the {{accounts}} of antiquarians {{as part of his}} research. According to later archaeologists Amy Gazin-Schwartz and Cornelius Holtfdorf, Grinsell {{was one of the few}} archaeologists <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>generation</b> who was interested in the relationship between folklore and archaeology, comparing him in this way to continental European scholars Paul Saintyves, Horst Ohlhaver, and Karel C. Peeters.|$|E
5|$|Martin Luther King Jr. was the {{conscience}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>generation.</b> He gazed upon {{the great wall}} of segregation and saw that the power of love could bring it down. From the pain and exhaustion of his fight to fulfill the promises of our founding fathers for our humblest citizens, he wrung his eloquent statement of his dream for America. He made our nation stronger because he made it better. His dream sustains us yet.|$|E
5|$|Merv's {{grandson}} Robert Harvey {{made the}} Victorian Under-19 cricket team, {{but decided to}} focus on Australian rules football, {{becoming one of the}} most successful players <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>generation.</b> He made his AFL debut for St Kilda Football Club in 1988 and played 21 seasons before retiring at the end of 2008 as the most capped current player.|$|E

5|$|Sir John Frederick Neville Cardus, CBE (3 April 188828 February 1975) was an English {{writer and}} critic. From an impoverished home background, and mainly self-educated, he became The Manchester Guardians cricket {{correspondent}} in 1919 and its chief music critic in 1927, holding the two posts simultaneously until 1940. His contributions {{to these two}} distinct fields {{in the years before}} the Second World War established his {{reputation as one of the}} foremost critics <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>generation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Subtitled Fantasie en forme de quadrille sur les thèmes favoris de l'Anneau de Nibelung ("Fantasy in {{the form}} of a quadrille on {{favourite}} themes from Der Ring des Nibelungen"). Fauré admired the music of Wagner and was familiar with the smallest details of his scores, but he was one of the few composers <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>generation</b> not to come under Wagner's musical influence.|$|E

5|$|Wright is {{currently}} rated {{as one of}} the leading indigenous British painters <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>generation,</b> largely for the distinctive realism in his portraiture. Perhaps due to the unusually cosmopolitan nature of his experience, he was favoured by patrons at the highest level of society in an age in which foreign artists were usually preferred. Wright's paintings of royalty and aristocracy are included amongst the collections of many leading galleries today.|$|E
5|$|A {{creative}} offensive playmaker {{renowned for}} his vision, technique, and goalscoring ability, Totti {{is considered to}} be one of the greatest Italian players of all time, one of the most talented players <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>generation,</b> and Roma's greatest ever player. He won a record eleven Oscar del calcio awards from the Italian Footballers' Association: five Serie A Italian Footballer of the Year awards, two Serie A Footballer of the Year awards, two Serie A Goal of the Year awards, one Serie A Goalscorer of the Year award, and one Serie A Young Footballer of the Year award. Totti is the fifth-highest scoring Italian in all competitions, with 316 goals.|$|E
5|$|After the Glorious Revolution, Wright, a Jacobite, {{fell out}} of favour at the royal court. The Flemish-Spanish painter John Baptist Medina (1659–1710) came to Scotland in 1693 and became the leading Scottish {{portrait}} painter <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>generation.</b> Among his best known works are {{a group of about}} 30 oval bust-lengths, including a self-portrait, in Surgeons' Hall, Edinburgh. He trained his son, also John, and William Aikman (1682–1731), who became the leading Scottish portrait-painter of the next generation. Aikman migrated to London in 1723, and from this point until the late eighteenth century, most Scottish painters of note followed him.|$|E
60|$|It {{was in the}} doubly refracting {{nature of}} Mr. Britling's mind {{that while he was}} deploring his {{inefficiency}} in regard to his son, he was also deploring the ineffectiveness <b>of</b> all <b>his</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> parents. Quite insensibly his mind passed over to the generalised point of view.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the story}} is quite close to the {{original}} Sorbian tale of Krabat {{that dates back to}} the 18th century, Preußler himself also considered it to tell the story <b>of</b> himself, <b>his</b> <b>generation,</b> and all young people who encounter power and its temptations and get ensnarled by it.|$|R
50|$|Those weren't {{the only}} souvenirs the elder Caldwell kept <b>of</b> <b>his</b> war experience. He {{managed to keep}} two {{invasion}} maps detailing the strategies for Peleliu and gave them to his son, a reminder <b>of</b> the sacrifices <b>his</b> <b>generation</b> had made.|$|R
5|$|Fauré's {{music has}} been {{described}} as linking the end of Romanticism with the modernism of the second quarter of the 20th century. When he was born, Chopin was still composing, and by the time of Fauré's death, jazz and the atonal music of the Second Viennese School were being heard. The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, which describes him as the most advanced composer <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>generation</b> in France, notes that his harmonic and melodic innovations influenced the teaching of harmony for later generations. During the last twenty years of his life, he suffered from increasing deafness. In contrast with the charm of his earlier music, his works from this period are sometimes elusive and withdrawn in character, and at other times turbulent and impassioned.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, Chapman scored 472 runs at 52.44 {{and took}} 15 wickets; the {{following}} year, he captained the team, scored 637 runs {{at an average}} of 70.77 and took 40 wickets. As a consequence of his achievements, he was chosen as one of the Cricketers of the Year for 1919 in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. In both 1918 and 1919 he was selected for prestigious school representative matches at Lord's Cricket Ground; although his weak defensive play drew comment, he was {{regarded as one of the}} most promising cricketers <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>generation</b> when he left Uppingham in 1919.|$|E
5|$|In this way, much to Metternich's {{disappointment}} and to Franz Josef's embarrassment, Austria began the Second Italian War of Independence against the combined forces of Piedmont-Sardinia and its ally France. Though Metternich {{was able to}} secure the replacement of Buol with his friend Rechberg, who had helped him so much in 1848, involvement in the war itself was now beyond his capacity. Even a special task given him by Franz Josef in June 1859—to draw up secret papers addressing the event of Franz Josef's death—was now too taxing. Shortly afterwards Metternich died in Vienna on 11 June 1859, aged 86, and the last great figure <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>generation.</b> Almost everyone of note in Vienna came to pay tribute; in the foreign press his death went virtually unnoticed.|$|E
50|$|Alexander Boskovich {{had many}} {{students}}: young composers <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own <b>generation</b> {{as well as}} older ones.
