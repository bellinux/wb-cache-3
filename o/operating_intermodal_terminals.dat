This document is disseminated under the sponsorship of the Department of Transportation, University Transportation Centers Program, in the interest of information exchange. The U. S. Government assumes no liability for the contents or use thereof. Metropolitan planning organizations in the intermodal transportation business depend on many types of support equipment to effectively <b>operate</b> <b>intermodal</b> <b>terminals.</b> The acquisition, productive use and retirement of such equipment require the consideration of the reliability and maintainability (R&M) characteristics of the equipment. Through an industrial survey and literature review, we explore the types of support equipment used in <b>intermodal</b> <b>terminals</b> and the R&M characteristics of such equipment. We use the concept of a “performability index ” (which has previously been applied only to manufacturing systems) to determine the robustness of a transportation system where support equipment is subject to failure and repair. We then use this knowledge to model an intermodal facility and characterize the loss in system performanc...|$|R

Detailed analysis has to be performed by decision-making regarding the siting of <b>intermodal</b> <b>terminals.</b> The work analyzes the relevant criteria necessary for the siting of <b>intermodal</b> <b>terminals.</b> The problem of the proposed research is the structure of intermodal systems in the Republic of Croatia with the case study of inland waterways. The research and the study of the characteristics of <b>intermodal</b> <b>terminals</b> network on inland waterways should result in a concept of system reorganization, i. e. terminal planning methodology. By analysing relevant indicators according to the existing facts, and by using scientific methods and methodologies, the relevant criteria necessary to define the position and categories of <b>intermodal</b> <b>terminals</b> on inland waterways in the Republic of Croatia have been defined and evaluated on the examples of Sisak, Osijek, Vukovar and Slavonski Brod.

40|$|Intermodal freight {{transport}} {{is a significant}} sector of the transport industry, and <b>intermodal</b> <b>terminals</b> {{play a crucial role}} in that sector. Therefore, decision regarding suitable location for an <b>intermodal</b> <b>terminal</b> is a critical element of the establishment process – it is essential for the functionality of the total intermodal freight distribution chain. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate criteria used for determination of suitable locations for <b>intermodal</b> <b>terminals.</b> In compliance with the European traffic policy and efficient functioning of intermodal transport, location criteria were formed and evaluated: legislative, environmental, cargo flows, spatial, technical–technological and organizational. Each criterion is divided further into sub-criteria and evaluated with the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. The criteria for defining the network of <b>intermodal</b> <b>terminals</b> and their efficiency in the processes have great impact on the quality of the entire process of intermodal transport. The results show that the criterion of goods flows has the most significant impact on the selection of the terminal location, followed by spatial criterion...|$|R

40|$|The {{main control}} object of Quay crane, which is <b>operating</b> in seaport <b>intermodal</b> <b>terminal</b> cargo loading and {{unloading}} process, is the crane trolley. One of the main frequent problem, which occurs, is the swinging of the container. This swinging is caused not only by external forces {{but also by the}} movement of the trolley. The research results of recent years produced various types of control algorithms by the other researchers. The control algorithms are solving separate control problems of Quay crane in laboratory environment. However, there is still complex control algorithm design and the controller’s parameter estimation problems to be solved. This paper presents mathematical model of the Quay crane trolley mechanism with the suspended cargo. The mathematical model is implemented in Matlab Simulink environment and using Dormand-Prince solving method. The presented model of laboratory quay crane mathematical model is dedicated to parameter estimation of PID controller of closed loop system with the usage of S –form speed input profile. The article includes the dynamic model of the presented system, the description of closed loop system and modeling results. These results will be used as an initial information for the PID parameters estimation in real quay crane control system. The simu-lation of the model was performed using estimated values of controller. The sway influence of the cargo, the usage of the trolley speed input S-shaper and the PID controller was used to control the trolley speed...|$|R
