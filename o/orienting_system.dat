Current evidence suggests that PCP integrates both global and local signals to orient diverse structures with respect to the body axes.

40|$|Prehension may {{be defined}} as "The act of taking hold, seizing or grasping, as with the hand" (Webster's 3 rd International Dictionary). Nonprehensile {{manipulation}}, then, {{can be defined as}} the manipulation of objects without grasping them. Manipulation without prehension is a natural way of handling objects for both humans and machines. The ability to manipulate objects which may not be graspable increases the flexibility of a robot interacting with its environment, without adding complexity to the mechanical design. This research analyses the mechanics of nonprehensile contact between a simple, two degree of freedom manipulator and a part. The intent is to develop reliable but sensorless manipulation routines for use in an automated assembly environment.

40|$|Parts orienting, {{the process}} of {{bringing}} parts in initially unknown orientations to a goal orientation, is {{an important aspect of}} automated assembly. Bowl feeders used in industry rely on a sequence of mechanical operations, without using sensors, to orient parts. In our work, we use partial information sensors along with mechanical operations to eliminate uncertainty in part orientation. We show that sensorbased orienting plans need O(m) operations, where m is the maximum number of states with the same sensor value. We characterize the relation between part shape, orientability, and recognizability to identify conditions under which a single plan can orient and recognize multiple part shapes. We describe implemented planners and experiments to demonstrate generated plans. 1 Introduction A parts <b>orienting</b> <b>system</b> must bring randomly oriented parts to goal orientations for assembly.

40|$|Parts {{manufactured}} to tolerances have {{variations in}} shape. Most previous work in robotic manipulation assumes that parts {{do not have}} shape variations. Orienting devices such as bowl feeders often fail due to variations in part shape. We {{study the effects of}} uncertainty in part shape on orienting to develop systems that can orient toleranced polygonal parts. We present a tolerance model in which the part center of mass and vertices lie in circular uncertainty zones around their nominal positions. The variations in part shape are characterized by the tolerance model and the part's nominal shape. We describe the nondeterminism that arises due to part shape uncertainty for a conveyor-based <b>orienting</b> <b>system</b> and show that sensor-based and sensorless orienting plans can exist for toleranced polygonal parts. We present implemented planners that generate orienting plans for the entire variational class of part shapes given a nominal part shape and tolerance bounds. These plans use both deterministic and nondeterministic actions to orient the parts, and we describe experiments to demonstrate them...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} a biologically inspired solution to problems {{that arise in}} multisensory attention, with a specific application to binaural humanoid robotics. The focus was on using only two microphones as an analogy to mammalian auditory system. The goal was to localize a salient sound source and to fuse this information with a visual-salience feature selection system. We describe a method to select task-relevant sounds in the auditory scene using both interaural time difference (ITD), inspired {{by the work of}} Jeffress and Konishi in the avian auditory system. We modelled the well-studied coincidence detectors of the barn owl as banks of frequency-tuned delay-and-sum beamformers, with frequency decomposition based on a Gammatone model of the human cochlea. Furthermore, we developed a useful metric of auditory salience that emphasized onsets of spectrally complex sounds. Finally, we developed an interface between this auditory-salience based attention <b>orienting</b> <b>system</b> and an existing visual-salience based attention system on the iCub humanoid robot.

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the human-specificity of the <b>orienting</b> <b>system</b> that allows {{neonates}} to look preferentially at faces. Three experiments {{were carried out}} {{to determine whether the}} face-perception system that is present at birth is broad enough to include both human and nonhuman primate faces. The results demonstrate that the newborns did not show any spontaneous visual preference for the human face when presented simultaneously with a monkey face that shared the same features, configuration, and low-level perceptual properties (Experiment 1). The newborns were, however, able to discriminate between the 2 faces belonging to the 2 different species (Experiment 2). In Experiment 3, the newborns were found to prefer looking at an upright, compared with an inverted, monkey face, as they do for human faces. Overall, the results demonstrate that newborns perceive monkey and human faces in a similar way. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the system underlying face preference at birth is broad enough to bias newborns' attention toward both human and nonhuman primate faces...|$|E

40|$|Hairs, feathers, and scales {{normally}} exhibit precise orientations {{with respect}} to the body axes. In Frizzled 6 (Fz 6) −/− mice, the global orientation of hair follicles is disrupted, leading to waves, whorls, and tufts, each comprising many hundreds of hairs. By analyzing the orientation of developing hair follicles, we observed that the nearly parallel arrangement of wild-type (WT) hairs arises from fields of imperfectly aligned follicles, and that the Fz 6 −/− hair patterns arise from fields of grossly misoriented or randomly oriented follicles. Despite their large size, both mutant and WT hair follicles display a remarkable and unexpected plasticity, reorienting on a time scale of days in {{what seems to be a}} self-organized refinement process. The essential features of this process can be studied with a simple cellular automata model in which a local consensus “rule” acts iteratively to bias each hair's orientation in favor of the average orientation of its neighbors. These experiments define two systems for hair orientation: a global <b>orienting</b> <b>system</b> that acts early in development and is Fz 6 -dependent, and a local self-organizing system that acts later and is Fz 6 independent...|$|E
40|$|Forty-nine mother–infant dyads {{participated in}} the study. Mothers were {{observed}} during free play with their infants to assess their attention-directing strategies. Infants were observed during the Bayley to assess their focused attention abilities. Assessments were made when infants were 10 and 18 months. Whereas consistently high levels of maintaining over time were modestly associated with better infant fo-cused attention at 18 months, consistently high levels of redirecting were moderately associated with poorer infant focused attention at 18 months. Additionally, more fo-cused attention was associated with higher Bayley scores at both ages. Although the direction of effects could not be determined, the findings suggest links between maternal attention-directing strategies (maintaining and redirecting) during play and infant attentional abilities during problem solving.

In the second stage Pargament’s theory enabled an analysis of how the person’s means in different circumstances changed to reach certain important goals, significance. Results showed that the individual went through several of the stages and conversion motifs described by Rambo.

40|$|Exogenous {{orienting}} is {{when our}} attention is automatically driven by external stimuli, {{such as a}} tap on our shoulder. Behavioural studies of exogenous attention have demonstrated inhibition of return (IOR) in detection of tactile targets and mixed results in discrimination tasks. Event related potential (ERP) experiments of exogenous attention have highlighted possible neural correlates of IOR in vision, however, no previous study has investigated how exogenous tactile attention affects somatosensory processing. In the present study non-informative lateralized tactile cues followed by tactile targets were presented to the middle fingers and thumbs. Responses were made vocally and in experiment 1 participant’s simply detected targets whilst in experiment 2 they discriminated the location (thumb/index), regardless hand. Behavioural results showed IOR in the detection task whilst no attention effect in the discrimination task. ERPs from the two tasks showed an early (N 80) enhanced negativity for uncued compared to cued targets suggesting exogenous attention affects early somatosensory processing. Overall ERP effects were similar in both tasks, however, similarly to P 1 in vision, P 100 attention effect may also be linked to IOR in touch as a contralateral P 100 components was present in detection whilst absent in discrimination task. Further, analysis of cue-target interval showed anterior directed attention negativity (ADAN) previously only linked to endogenous attention which in turn may suggest endogenous and exogenous orienting {{are part of a}} shared <b>orienting</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E
