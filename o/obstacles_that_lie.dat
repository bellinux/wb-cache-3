This reduces {{the possibility of}} human error and increase efficiency of whole process. This research presents a new algorithm to plan path for autonomous mobile robot based on image processing techniques by using wireless camera that provides the desired image for the unknown environment. The proposed algorithm is applied on this image to obtain a optimal path for the robot. It {{is based on the}} observation and analysis of the <b>obstacles</b> <b>that</b> <b>lying</b> in the straight path between the start and the goal point by detecting these obstacles, analyzing and studying their shapes, positions and points of intersection with the straight path to find the nearly optimal path which connects the start and the goal point. This work has theoretical part and experimental part. The theoretical part includes building a MATLAB program which is applied to environment image to find the nearly optimal path. MATLAB - C++. NET interface is accomplished then to supply the path information for C++. NET program which is done for programming the pioneer mobile robot to achieve the desired path. The experimental part includes using wireless camera that takes an image for the environment and send it to the computer which processes this image and sends (by wireless connection) the resulted path information to robot which programmed in C++. NET program to walk according to this path. So, the overall system can be represented by: Wireless camera  computer  wireless connection for the mobile robot. The experimental work including some experiments shows that the developed mobile robot (pioneer p 3 -dx) travels successfully from the start point and reach the goal point across the optimal path (according to time and power) which is obtained as result of the proposed path planning algorithm introduced in this paper. <br /...|$|R

60|$|Although, to {{restless and}} ardent minds, morning {{may be the}} fitting season for {{exertion}} and activity, {{it is not always}} at that time that hope is strongest or the spirit most sanguine and buoyant. In trying and doubtful positions, youth, custom, a steady contemplation of the difficulties which surround us, and a familiarity with them, imperceptibly diminish our apprehensions and beget comparative indifference, if not a vague and reckless confidence in some relief, the means or nature of which we care not to foresee. But when we come, fresh, upon such things in the morning, with that dark and silent gap between us and yesterday; with every link in the brittle chain of hope, to rivet afresh; our hot enthusiasm subdued, and cool calm reason substituted in its stead; doubt and misgiving revive. As the traveller sees farthest by day, and becomes aware of rugged mountains and trackless plains which the friendly darkness had shrouded from his sight and mind together, so, the wayfarer in the toilsome path of human life sees, with each returning sun, some new obstacle to surmount, some new height to be attained.

5000|$|Grit in {{psychology}} is a positive, non-cognitive trait {{based on an}} individual's passion for a particular long-term goal or end state, coupled with a powerful motivation to achieve their respective objective. This perseverance of effort promotes the overcoming of <b>obstacles</b> or challenges <b>that</b> <b>lie</b> within a gritty individual's path to accomplishment, {{and serves as a}} driving force in achievement realization. Commonly associated concepts within the field of psychology include [...] "perseverance", [...] "hardiness", [...] "resilience", [...] "ambition", [...] "need for achievement" [...] and [...] "conscientiousness". These constructs can be conceptualized as individual differences related to the accomplishment of work rather than talent or ability. This distinction was brought into focus in 1907 when William James challenged the field to further investigate how certain individuals are capable of accessing richer trait reservoirs enabling them to accomplish more than the average person, but the construct dates back at least to Galton, and the ideals of persistence and tenacity have been understood as a virtue at least since Aristotle.|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} why {{the demand}} for a membership referendum has arisen anew despite the precious EEC referendum in 1975. It does so by explaining British Euroscepticism towards European integration {{as a manifestation of}} British exceptionalism. The argument pursued in this article is {{that it is necessary to}} examine {{the demand for}} a referendum on EU membership as part of an, in EU terms, exceptional, four-decades-long debate or "neverendum". The success of Euroscepticism in contemporary Britain means the never-ending debate over the EU is fundamentally trapped in enduring calls for a membership referendum. However, the outcome will be much less certain than in 1975 because the pro-EU camp faces three significant <b>obstacles</b> <b>that</b> did not <b>lie</b> in the path of those who supported EEC membership at the time of the last referendum. These are: the likely absence of meaningful concessions during renegotiation, a querulous media environment, and the rise of an effective anti-establishment party (UKIP) that mobilizes both anti-EU and anti-elite sentiment. Hence the future EU referendum campaign will look very different from that of 1975...|$|R

We describe and analyze robot strategies that minimize this ratio for different kinds of scenes. In particular, we consider the cases of rectangular obstacles aligned with the axes, rectangular obstacles in more general orientations, and wider classes of convex bodies both in two and three dimensions. For many of these situations, our algorithms are optimal up to constant factors. We study scenes with non-convex obstacles, which are related to the study of maze-traversal.

The Inter-American {{relations have}} reached a new phase characterized by the growth of commercial relationships, by crossed investments and interchange of diverse kind. The Miami Metropolitan Area, strategically located at the Southern tip of the United States, close to the Straits of Florida, has become {{during the last two}} decades the main gateway for this flux of exchange to and from the Caribbean and Latin America. Taking advantage of its "hub and spokes" function through its port and its airport, it has become a large sprawling metropolis, a center of attraction for international tourism and it now vies for some kind of political status.

A meta-narrative review of the mission’s official statements was conducted to examine the positions, discourses and tensions across the broad range of agendas. The Holy See represents a fundamentally conservative and stable position on a range of sexual and reproductive health rights concerns. However, the mission has been dynamic in the ways in which it has forwarded its arguments, increasingly relying upon secularised technical claims and empirical evidence; strategically interpreting human rights norms in ways consistent with its own position; and framing sexuality and reproduction in the context of “the family”.

40|$|Recent {{papers have}} shown optimally-competitive on-line {{strategies}} for a robot traveling {{from a point}} s to a point t in certain unknown geometric environments. We consider the question: Having gained some partial information about the scene on its first trip from s to t, can the robot improve its performance on subsequent trips it might make? This {{is a type of}} on-line problem where a strategy must exploit partial information about the future (e. g., about <b>obstacles</b> <b>that</b> <b>lie</b> ahead). For scenes with axis-parallel rectangular obstacles where the Euclidean distance between s and t is n, we present a deterministic algorithm whose average trip length after k trips, k ≤ n, is O() times the length of the shortest s-t path in the scene. We also show that this is the best a deterministic strategy can do. This algorithm {{can be thought of as}} performing an optimal tradeoff between search effort and the goodness of the path found. We improve this algorithm so that for every i ≤ n, the robot's ith trip length is O() times the shortest s-t path length. A key idea of the paper is that a tree structure can be defined in the scene, where the nodes are portions of certain obstacles and the edges are "short" paths from a node to its children. The core of our algorithms is an on-line strategy for traversing this tree optimally. Comment: 10 page...|$|E
40|$|The {{protection}} {{of civil rights}} in the United States encompasses remedies {{for at least five}} separate groups. Native Americans have suffered extermination, removal, denial of sovereignty, and destruction of culture; Latinos, conquest and the indignities of a racially discriminatory immigration system. Asian Americans suffered exclusion, wartime internment, and discriminatory labor laws. Middle Eastern people suffer from suspicion that they are terrorists. Blacks suffered slavery and Jim Crow. Yet our system of civil rights derives, in large part, from the experience of only Blacks, and aims to redress a single, momentous harm, namely slavery and its lingering effects. This is particularly true of the Thirteenth Amendment, which aims to abolish slavery and other conditions reminiscent of it. American case law, particularly in connection with matters of race, proceeds largely through a process of analogy in which courts compare the case before them to a previous decision or statute. Nonblack groups sometimes have been able to analogize their predicaments to ones that Blacks suffer, but often this has proven difficult. Thus, afflictions that visit few Blacks, such as wartime internment and language discrimination, can easily go unremedied under American law. This Essay discusses a number of <b>obstacles</b> <b>that</b> <b>lie</b> in the way of protecting Latinos and other nonblack minority groups under the current framework of statutory and constitutional civil rights, including the Thirteenth Amendment. After discussing drawbacks associated with a system of civil rights protection still inflected with the rhetoric and norms of the 1960 s civil rights movement, the Essay closes by arguing that an increasingly multiracial society such as this one needs to develop a broader, more inclusive framework and [...] with Latinos in mind [...] sketches one...|$|E
