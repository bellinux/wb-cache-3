5|$|Allahabad attracts {{students}} from throughout India. As of 2017, {{the city has}} <b>one</b> <b>central</b> university, one State Universities, three deemed universities and an open university. Allahabad University, founded in 1876, is the oldest university in the state. Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology Allahabad is a noted technical institution. Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences is an 'A-grade', deemed university with global standards. Other notable institutions in Allahabad include the Indian Institute of Information Technology - Allahabad; Motilal Nehru Medical College; Ewing Christian College; Harish-Chandra Research Institute; Govind Ballabh Pant Social Science Institute; Allahabad State University and Institute of Engineering and Rural Technology.|$|E
5|$|Balakirev's despotism {{strained}} {{the relationship}} between him and Tchaikovsky but both men still appreciated each other's abilities. Despite their friction, Balakirev proved the only man to persuade Tchaikovsky to rewrite a work several times, as he would with Romeo and Juliet. At Balakirev's suggestion, Tchaikovsky based the work on Balakirev's King Lear, a tragic overture in sonata form after the example of Beethoven's concert overtures. It was Tchaikovsky's idea to reduce the plot to <b>one</b> <b>central</b> conflict and represent it musically with the binary structure of sonata form. However, the execution of that plot in the music we know today came only after two radical revisions. Balakirev discarded many of the early drafts Tchaikovsky sent him and, with the flurry of suggestions between the two men, the piece was constantly in the mail between Moscow and Saint Petersburg.|$|E
5|$|In chemistry, <b>one</b> <b>central</b> {{issue was}} the {{distinction}} between organic and inorganic substances, especially {{in the context of}} organic transformations such as fermentation and putrefaction. Since Aristotle these had been considered essentially biological (vital) processes. However, Friedrich Wöhler, Justus Liebig and other pioneers of the rising field of organic chemistry—building on the work of Lavoisier—showed that the organic world could often be analyzed by physical and chemical methods. In 1828 Wöhler showed that the organic substance urea could be created by chemical means that do not involve life, providing a powerful challenge to vitalism. Cell extracts ("ferments") that could effect chemical transformations were discovered, beginning with diastase in 1833. By the end of the 19th century the concept of enzymes was well established, though equations of chemical kinetics would not be applied to enzymatic reactions until the early 20th century.|$|E

5|$|On {{the north}} side of the temple {{courtyard}} is the Manjusri Hall (文殊殿). It was constructed in 1137 during the Jin dynasty and is roughly the same size as the East Hall, also measuring seven bays by four. It is located on an 83cm (2.7ft) high platform, has three front doors and <b>one</b> <b>central</b> back door, and features a single-eave hip gable roof. The interior of the hall has only four support pillars. In order to support the large roof, diagonal beams are used. On each of the four walls are murals of arhats painted in 1429 during the Ming dynasty.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>central</b> {{coenzyme}} is {{adenosine triphosphate}} (ATP), the universal energy currency of cells. This nucleotide {{is used to}} transfer chemical energy between different chemical reactions. There {{is only a small}} amount of ATP in cells, but as it is continuously regenerated, the human body can use about its own weight in ATP per day. ATP acts as a bridge between catabolism and anabolism. Catabolism breaks down molecules, and anabolism puts them together. Catabolic reactions generate ATP, and anabolic reactions consume it. It also serves as a carrier of phosphate groups in phosphorylation reactions.|$|E
5|$|The early 19th century saw {{the first}} {{attempts}} at securing liberation from Spain, which were led in northern South America by Bolívar. He and the independence movements won numerous battles in Venezuela, New Granada and present-day Ecuador and Peru. His dream of uniting the Spanish American nations under <b>one</b> <b>central</b> government was almost achieved. However, shortly after the South American colonies became independent of Spain, problems developed in the capitals, and civil wars were sparked in some provinces; Bolívar lost many of his supporters and fell ill. Opposition to his presidency continued to increase, and in 1830, after 11years of rule, he resigned as president of Gran Colombia.|$|E

5|$|The overall {{growth rate}} of the silky shark is {{moderate}} compared to other shark species and similar for both sexes, though it varies significantly between individuals. <b>One</b> <b>central</b> Pacific study has found females growing much slower than males, but the results may have been skewed by missing data from large females. The highest reported growth rates are from sharks in the northern Gulf of Mexico, and the lowest from sharks off northeastern Taiwan. Males and females reach sexual maturity at ages of 6–10years and 7–12+years, respectively. Sharks from more temperate waters may grow slower and mature later than those in warmer regions. The maximum lifespan is at least 22years.|$|E
5|$|The use of aisles {{enabled the}} barn's architects to {{increase}} its width and by doing so, provided the maximum space for threshing floors. The longer the barn was, the more threshing floors could be provided. English barns went through an evolution {{in the number of}} threshing floors; the earliest had just <b>one</b> <b>central</b> floor, a design that became the commonest to be found in Britain. Harmondsworth Great Barn is unusual in having three threshing floors, allowing much more grain to be threshed at one time.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{hardwood}} hammocks in the Everglades {{have been}} harvested for lumber, particularly by shipbuilders seeking West Indian mahogany and black ironwood (Krugiodendron ferreum). The {{largest and most}} mature of these trees had been removed by the late 18th century. Seminoles made their villages in hammocks in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; they lived in groups of chickees numbering half a dozen, with <b>one</b> <b>central</b> chickee for cooking and another for eating. Dugout canoes, cookware, stills, and sewing machines may still be found in remote locations.|$|E

5|$|The final {{project for}} his great patron Eusebi Güell was {{the church for}} the Colònia Güell, an {{industrial}} village in Santa Coloma de Cervelló (1890–1918). The project began in 1890, and the factory, service buildings and housing for the workers were constructed. What {{would have been the}} colony's church was designed by Gaudí in 1898, though the first stone was not laid until 4 October 1908. Unfortunately only the crypt (known today as Crypt of the Colònia Güell) was built, as Güell's sons abandoned the project after his death in 1918. Gaudí designed an oval church with five aisles, <b>one</b> <b>central</b> aisle and two at either side. He conceived it as fully integrated into nature. A porch of hyperbolic paraboloid vaults precedes the crypt, the first time that Gaudí used this structure and notably the first use of paraboloid vaults in the history of architecture. In the crypt the large hyperboloid stained glass windows stand out, with the shapes of flower petals and butterfly wings. Inside, circular brick pillars alternate with slanted basalt columns from Castellfollit de la Roca.|$|E

25|$|The 3–3–3–1 {{system is}} a very attacking {{formation}} and its compact nature is ideally suited for midfield domination and ball possession. It means a coach can field more attacking players and add extra strength through {{the spine of the}} team. The attacking three are usually two wing-backs or wingers with the central player of the three occupying a central attacking midfield or second striker role behind the centre-forward. The midfield three consists of two centre midfielders ahead of <b>one</b> <b>central</b> defensive midfielder or alternatively <b>one</b> <b>central</b> midfielder and two defensive midfielders. The defensive three can consist of three centre-backs or one centre-back with a full-back either side.|$|E
