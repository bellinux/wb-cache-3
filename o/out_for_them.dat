After the war she wrote a book about her experiences, Byłam Warszawskim Robinsonem (I was a Warsaw Robinson). A portion of her group left the hiding place after German troops called <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to surrender and were immediately executed. The rest remained hidden and escaped detection. Eventually they used the corpses of their murdered companions to disguise the entry to their hiding place.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to Schaeffer's own {{experience as a}} single child of a father with a third-grade education and a depressed mother, {{he grew up with}} a drive to understand reality in its complexity, including the glorious and tragic human realities. He was deeply engaged in the lives of each of his four children, continuously available to them, showing and explaining art, history, city and country life, philosophy, Roman ruins and medieval and Renaissance efforts to civilize a damaged human history. He enjoyed watching people, engaging them in conversation and showing his children the joy and tragedy of human existence. He laid <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> the philosophic foundations of societies without being idealistic about any of them.|$|E

25|$|If one accepts that Shakespeare made a {{conscious}} decision to use Holinshed more frequently during his re-editing of True Tragedy, one must ask why he may have done so. True Tragedy is roughly one thousand lines shorter than 3 Henry VI, and whilst many of the differences are simple aesthetic changes and alternate phraseology (much of which is easily attributable to inaccurate reporting), one major difference between the two that runs throughout is how they each handle violence. On the whole, 3 Henry VI is far more restrained in its depiction of war, whereas True Tragedy has more explicit and sustained on-stage combat and more royal processions and celebrations after combat. Much more so than does 3 Henry VI, True Tragedy conforms to the so-called Tudor myth that the Wars of Roses were God's punishment for people straying from the path laid <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> and His means of purging the country of evil and opening the way for the righteous Tudor dynasty to establish peace. Traditionally, this has been a common way of interpreting the entire octalogy; advocated and elaborated upon by critics as diverse as August Wilhelm Schlegel, Hermann Ulrici, Georg Gottfried Gervinus, Irving Ribner, M.M. Reese, Robert Rentoul Reed, and, most famously, E.M.W. Tillyard, with whom the phrase Tudor myth is now most associated.|$|E

Once Nancy became pregnant again Claire Crick of All About Soap said [...] "At last – {{some good news}} in Hollyoaks for once! Our favourite soapy couple, Nancy and Darren, discover they’re going to be parents once again in tonight's episode, and we’ve got our fingers (and toes!) crossed that it works <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> this time". She said that [...] "with Darren's cheeky escapades and Nancy's no-messing attitude, they’ll make the perfect parents and we can’t wait to see them with a little one". Crick {{went on to say}} [...] "while Darren might be dad to twins already (remember them? You could be forgiven for forgetting they even existed – it seems Darren already has!), we think he's got potential to be great daddy material".|$|E
500|$|The initial premise for {{the series}} was to examine what superheroes would be like [...] "in a credible, real world". As the story became more complex, Moore said Watchmen became about [...] "power and {{about the idea of}} the superman {{manifest}} within society." [...] The title of the series refers to the question [...] "Who watches the watchmen?", famously posed by the Roman satirist Juvenal (as [...] "Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?"), although Moore was not aware of the phrase's classical origins until Harlan Ellison informed him. Moore commented in 1987, [...] "In the context of Watchmen, that fits. 'They're watching out for us, who's watching <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>them?</b> The writer stated in the introduction to the Graphitti hardcover of Watchmen that while writing the series he was able to purge himself of his nostalgia for superheroes, and instead he found an interest in real human beings.|$|E

500|$|In the 1880s, {{despite the}} return of gold to {{commerce}} nationwide with the resumption of specie payments {{at the end of}} 1878, few three-dollar pieces were coined. [...] There was a small speculative boom by the public in putting aside three-dollar pieces; nevertheless, thousands remained at the Philadelphia Mint. [...] Few were sent to banks; the coins sold for a small premium when banks had some or when they were purchased from exchange brokers. [...] The coins' main use was as gifts, or in jewelry. [...] The pieces were struck only at Philadelphia after the 1870-S rarity, and early numismatist S.H.Chapman noted of the 1879 through 1889 issues, [...] "of the later years of the$3, large numbers were remelted at the Philadelphia Mint." [...] The Mint apparently favored certain Philadelphia dealers in the distribution of the gold dollar, but the three-dollar piece could be obtained without a premium at the cashier's window of the Philadelphia Mint. Large numbers of the 1879 three-dollar piece (mintage 3,000for circulation), 1880 (1,000), and 1881 (500) were hoarded by early coin collector and dealer Thomas L.Elder, who asked bank tellers to look <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> [...] Elder could not have obtained them directly from the Mint at the time of issue as he was still a child in 1880, and did not begin collecting coins until 1887.|$|E
500|$|Raja again {{encounters}} Drake during Eye of Indra, where Drake enlists {{his help}} in stealing the valuable Eye of Indra from Daniel Pinkerton. In Drake's Fortune, Eddy {{and his gang}} are hired by Gabriel Roman. Raja helps Roman capture Drake, though he and Elena escape. After large numbers of his men begin mysteriously dying, Raja becomes convinced that the island is cursed, and tries to convince Roman to stop looking for the treasure. When he does so, Roman accuses him of cowardice and fires him; Raja pulls a gun on Roman, but is stopped by Navarro. Raja is next seen looking for the treasure himself, and tries to have Drake killed one last time by sending {{the last of his}} men after him and Fisher. When Drake and Fisher find the room where El Dorado is supposedly located, they are followed by Eddy and his last surviving pirate, running from a large number of cursed Spaniards. He and Drake briefly work together to fight the creatures while Elena tries to find a way <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> During the gun battle, Raja takes his opportunity to tell Drake how much he hates him, though it may also be his way of admitting that despite their animosity, he always held a begrudging respect for Drake. Eventually, Raja is dragged down a hole by one of the creatures after being bitten and is presumed dead. His famous line is [...] "Don't mess with Eddy Raja!" ...|$|E

500|$|Mirroring the {{deliberately}} vague detail {{within the}} novel, the blurb {{on the book}} is unusually written, in {{that it does not}} name the characters or reveal the plot. It was written by a team at Sceptre led by marketing consultant Damian Horner, and has the approval of Cleave, who described it as [...] "genius". Cleave explained: [...] "I think readers are quite smart and don't really need the whole thing spelt <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> in a plot summary. It's nice to let them discover the book at their own speed. And the technique of the book is to release these dirty secrets gradually." [...] The content of the blurb varies between UK and American editions of the novel, but both begin: [...] "We don't want to tell you too much about this book. It is a truly special story and we don't want to spoil it." [...] and end: [...] "Once you have read it, you'll want to tell everyone about it. When you do, please don't tell them what happens either. The magic is in how it unfolds." [...] James Spackman, Sales and Marketing Director for Sceptre, was initially sceptical of the blurb, particularly disliking the use of [...] "we" [...] for the publisher to address the reader directly. Once the book became a best-seller, however, he revised his stance, and now believes that the reason the blurb works is because it makes a virtue of denying the reader information, with an unusual format and [...] "arrestingly direct" [...] tone. The blurb won Sceptre the [...] "Best Blurb" [...] award at the 2010 Book Marketing Society Awards.|$|E

2500|$|The {{second half}} was {{reported}} to be a [...] "very poor exhibition of football" [...] with substitutes playing at most positions. [...] Michigan's sole points of the second half came on a fumble recovery by William Louis Day. [...] Michigan missed the extra point kicks on its final three touchdowns. [...] (Touchdowns were worth five points and goals from touchdown (or extra points) worth one point under 1898 rules.) [...] Guy Blencoe also missed a field goal from placement from the 40-yard line in the second half. [...] In assessing the team's performance, the Detroit Free Press opined that the team was green, ragged, and slow, and concluded that [...] "the coaches certainly have their work cut <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> {{if they are going to}} make a winning team out of the raw material at hand." ...|$|E

[...] One of the earliest stories involves three Algonquian sisters who crossed the river in an attempt to win the release of their brothers, who had been kidnapped by another tribe. They drowned while crossing the river, and were turned into the rocky islets. A less commonly cited legend says three daughters of the local Native American chief were marooned on the islands by their father after rejecting the husbands he picked <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> The legend holds that the sisters cursed the spot, saying that if they could not cross the Potomac there, no one could.

2500|$|Captain Australia covered every Australian skipper (except for Ricky Ponting) since Test cricket began. Each chapter {{carried a}} mini-biography of the 41 leaders.

The Herald Sun Melbourne noted: [...] "There are some good stories in Captain Australia... The chapter on Greg Chappell [...] gives wonderful insight into the genius of Sir Donald Bradman." [...] Cricket magazine Inside Edge wrote: [...] "The appeal of Captain Australia... will be the detail on captains most of us never saw such as Murdoch, Blackham, Armstrong, Woodfull and Richardson... It’s a valuable addition to our cricketing canon." [...] Robin Marlar wrote in The Cricketer International: [...] "Perry is a prolific, stylish writer... What lifted this book for me was the 24-page prologue on a fascinating character, Charles Lawrence, the immigrant from England who took on the embryonic Australian establishment and brought the first, if not quite the only team of Aboriginals to England in 1868." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway’s western {{terminus}} was at Prince Rupert, {{and rail}} construction began from there in 1908. The railway construction firm of Foley, Welch and Stewart built the Distributor and the Skeena and purchased the Omineca in 1908. The latter was wrecked later that summer near Port Essington, but her machinery {{was put in}} another sternwheeler, and she was rechristened under the same name in 1909. That same year Foley, Welch and Stewart launched two more steamers, the Operator and the Conveyor, which would be piloted by Captain Con Myers and Captain Jack Shannon, respectively. These five sternwheelers had their work cut <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> The construction of the railway from Prince Rupert to Hazelton {{was one of the}} most difficult sections of track that would ever be laid in North America. This [...] stretch would take nearly four years to build and would employ thousands of workers. Four of the company sternwheelers hauled material and supplies for construction, while a fifth, the Skeena, was used almost exclusively to supply food to the camps of the construction workers. Much of these supplies were provided by meatpacker Pat Burns, who had wisely anticipated this need and had a built slaughterhouse at Hazelton.|$|E
2500|$|Players {{are able}} to pick a script {{provided}} by the studio's writers or write their own, although automated scripts take long to write in game time, while user-written scripts take longer to write in real time. For pre-written scripts, the player hires a writer at the Scriptwriting Office to make one. Multiple writers can collaborate on a single script in order to write it quicker. A series of upgrades, which are unlocked by winning studio awards, will allow the player to build higher quality Scriptwriting Offices, which increase the maximum rating a script can garner (1 star to 4 stars). The ability to write one's own script is enabled after unlocking the Custom Scriptwriting Office, which is itself unlocked from winning an award. It is limited in terms of quality to what the highest scripting office can produce. Writing a custom script follows a storyboard-like suite. For each scene, the player chooses a set for the scene and then the action that will occur during the scene (for example: 'Living Room 1: Enter Scared'). The actors and their costumes can be chosen, extras assigned roles and mood, and lighting and weather settings altered. The process will cost money though, the price increasing for each scene. The player can choose to have the structure set <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> (e.g., Introduction, pursuit, conflict, resolution) or [...] "Freeform" [...] mode, {{where there are no}} guidelines.|$|E
