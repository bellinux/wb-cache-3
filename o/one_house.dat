5|$|A view {{of part of}} Albany, New York, {{as it was in}} 1814 shows {{a mixture}} of Dutch, English and Federal styles, {{although}} Dutch brick was reportedly used for one of the English-style houses. <b>One</b> <b>house</b> in the Dutch style was said to date from the American Revolution. If so, it would {{have been one of the}} last genuine Dutch-style houses to be built in the United States, reflecting the conservative Dutch culture of Albany at that time.|$|E
50|$|The demonstrative and {{relative}} pronouns {{form part of}} the correlative system, and are described in that article. The pronouns are the forms ending in -o (simple pronouns) and -u (adjectival pronouns). Their accusative case is formed in -n, but the genitive case ends in -es, {{which is the same}} for singular and plural and does not take accusative marking. Compare the nominative phases lia domo (his house) and ties domo (that <b>ones</b> <b>house,</b> those <b>ones</b> <b>house)</b> with the plural liaj domoj (his houses) and ties domoj (that <b>ones</b> <b>houses,</b> those <b>ones</b> <b>houses),</b> and with the accusative genitive lian domon and ties domon.|$|R

5|$|After Orlović's {{battalion}} {{entered the}} undefended village of Zamlača, the Serb rebels moved from <b>one</b> <b>house</b> to the next, ransacking homes and forcing any civilians they found {{to move to}} the main road. Approximately 50 civilians were captured in the village, they were then forced to walk in front of an armed vehicle towards Struga, forming a human shield. By 13:00, all the units earmarked for the advance between Dvor and Kozibrod had achieved their initial objectives, except for the platoon commanded by Sundać. By 14:30, Struga was under attack. The defending force in Struga was first engaged by the outflanking force and had no knowledge of what had happened in Zamlača. As the human shield and the SAO Krajina force reached Struga, the defending troops were reluctant to fire against them. As a consequence, three Croatian policemen deployed in <b>one</b> <b>house</b> were surrounded and subsequently surrendered. Their captors stripped them, ordered them to run and then killed them. Unsure {{how to deal with the}} situation, the Croatian forces withdrew from the southern part of the village. The unit protected by the human shield moved very slowly and took six hours to move from Zamlača to the centre of Struga.|$|E
5|$|Early in the afternoon, another {{supercell}} developed {{around the}} town of Maryborough, around 300km north of Brisbane. It developed rapidly also, and at 2:30pm a number of reports sent to the Bureau of Meteorology reported a tornado had touched down in Oakhurst, a rural area 10km west of Maryborough. However, due to the low population density in the area the reported damage was sparse, with <b>one</b> <b>house</b> destroyed, several others unroofed and hundreds of trees were snapped.|$|E
5|$|Florence {{produced}} wind {{gusts of}} up to 115mph (185km/h) on Bermuda, which caused several power outages and minor damage. Florence then brought heavy rains across Newfoundland as an extratropical storm, destroying <b>one</b> <b>house</b> and causing minor damage to several others. There were no fatalities {{as a result of}} the hurricane.|$|E

5|$|In Fakaofo, {{the storm}} surge from Percy damaged a sea wall and caused major beach erosion. <b>One</b> <b>house</b> was {{destroyed}} while others were severely damaged. Percy also damaged much of the coconut harvest and 50% of the livestock {{were killed by the}} cyclone. Atafu also suffered similar damage as the storm damaged a UHF tower and several storage sheds. Damage to crops was also significant as the storm damaged much of the banana and pandanus harvests. The schools in Atafu suffered only minimal damage (mostly wind damage).|$|E
5|$|Several nearby office blocks {{were hit}} {{so badly that}} almost every window, front and back, was blown in as the {{explosion}} ripped through them. The timing of the explosion before work hours possibly prevented additional casualties. Reports also indicated that cars in nearby streets caught fire. The roof of at least <b>one</b> <b>house</b> was blown off. Buildings in the vicinity were evacuated by police, {{not only because of}} the smoke and possibility of more explosions, but because of the danger of structural damage making the buildings unstable.|$|E
5|$|South of here, the Route 413 {{continues}} as a divided highway with one lane {{in each direction}} passing through an area of commercial businesses. The road comes to another oblong traffic circle, with intersections at Oakland Avenue, Washington Avenue, and Lincoln Avenue. <b>One</b> <b>house</b> and two businesses are located along {{the eastern edge of}} the circle. South of this circle, Route 413 ends at a complex intersection with US130 (on which County Route 543 runs concurrently), Taylor Avenue, Salem Road, and Mott Avenue.|$|E

5|$|Swells from Fico, {{combined}} with swells from a storm in the Southern Hemisphere, produced rough surf throughout the Hawaiian islands. The surf destroyed <b>one</b> <b>house</b> {{and resulted in}} considerable damage along the southern coast of the island of Hawaii. No deaths were reported, and damage totaled $200,000 (1978USD, $619,000 2006USD).|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of {{houses in the}} village were built between the 17th and late 19th centuries, including examples of Victorian Gothic architecture. Only <b>one</b> <b>house</b> has been built on the village's main street since the early 20th century. The parish hall, built in 1897, is predominantly flint and brick.|$|E
5|$|Winds from Tropical Storm Odette were {{relatively}} light across the Dominican Republic, with a peak gust of 60mph occurring in Santo Domingo. The storm dropped heavy rainfall for several hours, amounting {{to a maximum}} of 9.07inches (230mm) in Isla Saona. Several other locations reported over 4inches as well. The rainfall caused mudslides and flash flooding, forcing several rivers to overflow in combination with previous rains. In addition, a tornado was reported near Santo Domingo, destroying <b>one</b> <b>house</b> and uproofing several others.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{remained}} {{close to the}} United States coastline, its impact was minor. Beach erosion and light rainfall was reported along much of the coastline, although the precipitation was beneficial in ending droughts in South Carolina and New England. High waves destroyed <b>one</b> <b>house</b> in North Carolina. Damage was heaviest in New England, where several buildings were damaged and thousands were left without power. The passage of Ginny resulted in a snow storm across eastern New England, particularly in northern Maine, where it killed two people. In Atlantic Canada, the extratropical storm produced high wind and waves, causing damage to boats and resulting in power outages.|$|E
5|$|An {{isolated}} severe thunderstorm in {{the outer}} bands of Allison produced an F1 tornado in Worcester and Middlesex Counties in Massachusetts, impacting over 100trees and damaging <b>one</b> <b>house</b> and one small camper. A microburst in Leominster and another in Shirley damaged several trees. Lightning from the storm hit two houses, causing significant damage there but little elsewhere. Allison also produced moderate rainfall in the state, mainly ranging from 3 to 5inches (75 to 125mm). The rainfall caused drainage and traffic problems. Damage in Massachusetts totaled to $400,000 (2001USD, $520,000 2012USD).|$|E
5|$|Imported Dutch brick {{was often}} used in {{buildings}} in England in the 17th and 18th centuries. In Dartmouth, a house built in 1664 for mariner Robert Plumleigh had traditional timber-framed architecture but included elaborate star-shaped chimney stacks made from imported Dutch brick. Houses in Topsham, Devon, also used Dutch brick for chimneys, window heads and dressing. <b>One</b> <b>house</b> from the late 17th century in Dutch Court in Topsham is built entirely of Dutch brick. The ports of Exeter and Topsham both shipped wool to the Netherlands, and the returning ships brought bricks as ballast from Amsterdam or Rotterdam.|$|E
5000|$|Arlington House {{was taken}} over by Camden London Borough Council in the 1980s, but was {{subsequently}} privatised and later given without payment to <b>One</b> <b>Housing</b> Group (OHG) by the Novas Scarman group to ensure that building works were completed. [...] the building continued to be owned and managed by <b>One</b> <b>Housing</b> Group, having undergone major government-funded refurbishment, and reopened in 2010.

5000|$|Unite members held {{a four-day}} strike in 2014 after the {{suspension}} of their steward Bryan Kennedy. He had led a campaign against pay cuts in 2013, and was suspended immediately prior to a further round of negotiations on new pay reductions. <b>One</b> <b>Housing</b> Group denied any connection between the suspension and the negotiations. A Unite spokesperson accused <b>One</b> <b>Housing</b> of being [...] "an incredibly bad employer", which had cut wages of employees while increasing the salary of their CEO.|$|R
5|$|In Jamaica, where {{officials}} declared hurricane warnings 12hours {{prior to}} its closest approach, Mitch caused moderate rainfall and gusty winds for days. Strong waves hit western Jamaica, with wave heights unofficially estimated at nearly 7feet (2m) in height. The rainfall in outer rainbands, at times severe, flooded many roads across the island and left them covered with debris. <b>One</b> <b>house</b> in Spanish Town collapsed from the flooding, leaving four homeless. Many other homes and buildings were flooded, forcing many to evacuate. A river in northeastern Jamaica overflowed its banks, while heavy rainfall across the mountainous {{parts of the country}} caused numerous mudslides. In all, Mitch killed three people on Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} period many {{thousands}} of country houses of great architectural value were demolished, or had whole wings razed to the ground. In 1955 alone <b>one</b> <b>house</b> was demolished every five days. In this respect Belton was fortunate to survive at all, as {{in addition to the}} family's problems, the house deteriorated {{to such an extent that}} in 1961 the 6th Baron employed the architect Francis Johnson to oversee a large restoration program lasting three years. Not only was the roof repaired but much of the panelling taken down and repaired, and new cornices installed. Also attempts were made to curtail serious infestations of dry rot. By the time of the death of the 6th Baron in 1978, the resultant death duties, coupled with the rising costs of the upkeep, made Belton too much for the Brownlow family.|$|E
5|$|Millen {{introduced}} the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Bill, which provided for a paid repatriation commission and higher pensions for servicemen, into the Senate in March 1920. In {{response to the}} bill, and vigorous lobbying of Hughes by the veterans' movement, the bill faced difficulty in its passage and Senator Josiah Thomas successfully moved a resolution that a minister in <b>one</b> <b>house</b> might appear {{on the floor of}} the other. This bill would have allowed Millen to address the House of Representatives, where he was facing fierce criticism from the Country Party, although ultimately neither house acted on the resolution.|$|E

25|$|From a distance, the BWR design {{looks very}} {{different}} from PWR designs because usually a square building is used for containment. Also, because {{there is only one}} loop through the turbines and reactor, and the steam going through the turbines is also slightly radioactive, the turbine building has to be considerably shielded as well. This leads to two buildings of similar construction with the taller <b>one</b> <b>housing</b> the reactor and the short long <b>one</b> <b>housing</b> the turbine hall and supporting structures.|$|R
