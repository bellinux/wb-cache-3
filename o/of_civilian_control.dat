Because it was so new, there were no policies or precedents to guide legislators, and traditional party alignments were absent.

25|$|If <b>civilian</b> <b>control</b> is the {{critical}} variable for military effectiveness, it raises the question <b>of</b> how <b>civilian</b> <b>control</b> is then to be determined. Huntington identified two shaping forces or imperatives for <b>civilian</b> <b>control</b> – (1) functional and (2) societal. He broke the societal imperative into two components, ideology and structure. By ideology, he meant a world-view or paradigm: liberal anti-military, conservative pro-military, fascist pro-military, and Marxist anti-military. By structure, he meant the legal-constitutional framework that guided political affairs generally and civil-military affairs specifically.|$|R
5|$|A new {{aristocracy}} {{known as}} the Kazoku was established. It merged the ancient court nobility of the Heian period, the Kuge, and the former Daimyo, feudal lords subordinate to the Shogun. It also established the Imperial Diet, consisting of the House of Representatives and the House of Peers. Members of the House of Peers were {{made up of the}} Imperial Family, the Kazoku, and those nominated by the Emperor, while members of the House of Representatives were elected by direct male suffrage. Despite clear distinctions between powers of the executive branch and the Emperor in the Meiji Constitution, ambiguity and contradictions in the Constitution eventually led to a political crisis. It also devalued the notion <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>control</b> over the military, which meant that the military could develop and exercise a great influence on politics.|$|E
25|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War led to new {{debate about}} to {{the proper role of}} the {{military}} in society, both in the United States and in the former Soviet Union.

25|$|The {{involvement}} {{of the military in}} politics has historically led to regular, if infrequent, arbitrary arrest and detention, use of excessive force, torture, and extra-judicial killing by security forces and police. The judiciary has historically suffered from poor jail and prison conditions, prolonged pretrial detention, and executive interference in the judiciary. While all these have improved dramatically since the return to civilian rule, international human rights organizations continue to report sporadic incidents of all these abuses. Post-1999 there has been a marked improvement <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>control</b> of security forces, with the United States State Department contending every year since 2001 that the military was under civilian control.|$|E

25|$|Janowitz {{agreed with}} Huntington that, {{because of the}} {{fundamental}} differences between the civilian and military worlds, clashes would develop which would diminish the goal <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>control</b> of the military. His answer was to ensure that convergence occurred, thus ensuring that the military world would be imbued with the norms and expectations of the society that created it. He encouraged use of conscription, which would bring {{a wide variety of}} individuals into the military. He also encouraged the use of more Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) programs at colleges and universities to ensure that the military academies did not have a monopoly on the type of officer, particularly the senior general officer and flag officer leadership positions, in the military services. He specifically encouraged the development of ROTC programs in the more elite universities, so that the broader influences of society would be represented by the officer corps. The more such societal influences present within the military culture, the smaller the attitudinal differences between the two worlds and the greater the chance of civilians maintaining control over the military. Janowitz, like Huntington, believed that the civilian and military worlds were different from one another; while Huntington developed a theory to control the difference, Janowitz developed a theory to diminish the difference.|$|E
500|$|An apolitical {{military}} was an American tradition, {{but one that}} was difficult to uphold {{in an era when}} American forces were employed overseas in large numbers. The principle <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>control</b> of the {{military was}} also ingrained, but the rising complexity of military technology {{led to the creation of}} a professional military. This made civilian control increasingly problematic when coupled with the constitutional division of powers between the President as commander-in-chief, and the Congress with its power to raise armies, maintain a navy, and wage wars. In relieving MacArthur for failing to [...] "respect the authority of the President" [...] by privately communicating with Congress, Truman upheld the President's role as pre-eminent.|$|E
500|$|When the AEC {{was formed}} in 1947 it {{acquired}} custody of nuclear components from the Manhattan Project on the understanding that the matter would be reviewed. In November 1947, the Military Liaison Committee requested that custody of the nuclear stockpile {{be transferred to the}} military, but Lilienthal believed that AEC custody of the stockpile was an important aspect <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>control</b> of nuclear weapons. He was disturbed that the AFSWP had not informed the AEC in advance of Operation Ajax. For his part, Groves suspected that the AEC was not keeping bomb components in the condition in which the military wanted to receive them, and Operation Ajax only confirmed his suspicions. Reviewing the exercise, Montague reported that [...] "under the existing law, with the AEC charged with procurement and custody of all atomic weapons, there was no adequate logistic support for the weapon." [...] He recommended a larger role for the military, a recommendation with which Groves concurred, but was powerless to implement.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to answer}} the {{question}} of how and under what circumstances <b>civilian</b> <b>control</b> can be established in newly democratised nations. To do this, I propose a new theoretical argument that conceives of the process <b>of</b> institutionalising <b>civilian</b> <b>control</b> in new democracies as a series of power struggles between the democratically elected civilians and the military leadership. The outcome of these power struggles depends on the respective bargaining power <b>of</b> <b>civilians</b> and the military, which is in turn a function of (1) the willingness <b>of</b> <b>civilians</b> to challenge the military's institutional prerogatives and the military's willingness to defend them and (2) each party's ability to bear the costs of a civil-military conflict. To illustrate and assess the argument, I derive a number of propositions about the expected development of civil-military relations after the transition to democracy and the possible outcomes of civil-military power struggles, subsequently testing them via an in-depth case study of civil-military relations in post-transition South Korea...|$|R

500|$|Gerry's {{political}} philosophy {{was one of}} limited central government, and he regularly advocated for the maintenance <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>control</b> of the military. He held these positions fairly consistently throughout his political career (wavering principally {{on the need for}} stronger central government {{in the wake of the}} 1786–87 Shays's Rebellion) and was well known for his personal integrity. [...] In later years he was against the idea of political parties, remaining somewhat distant from the developing Federalist and Democratic-Republican parties until later in his career. [...] It was not until 1800 that he would formally associate with the Democratic-Republicans in opposition to what he saw as attempts by the Federalists to centralize too much power in the national government. [...] In 1780 he resigned from the Continental Congress over the issue, and refused offers from the state legislature to return to the Congress. [...] He also refused appointment to the state senate, claiming he would be more effective in the state's lower chamber, and also refused appointment as a county judge, comparing the offer by Governor John Hancock to those made by royally appointed governors to benefit their political allies. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1781.|$|E
500|$|A {{serious problem}} began to become evident during the 1880s. This was a {{weakening}} of discipline within Brazil's military. [...] The older generation of officers were {{loyal to the}} monarchy, believed the military should be under civilian control, and had a great aversion to the militaristic caudillism against which they had earlier fought. But these elders were no longer in control and many had since died, including the Duke of Caxias, the Count of Porto Alegre, the Marquis of Erval, and others. It was accepted that military officers could participate in politics while staying on active duty. However, most did so {{as members of the}} Conservative Party and Liberal Party. This meant that their political careers were apt to come into conflict with their duty as officers to act in subordination to the civilian government, which could {{be in the hands of}} their political opponents. Earlier involvement in politics by members of the military had not threatened the stability of Brazil's institutions, due to pervasive loyalty to the monarchy and constitution. The conflict of interest in mixing military and political spheres became more obvious and threatening as support for the constitutional establishment eroded among some elements within the military, although neither the Emperor or government seem to have grasped the extent and implications of the increasing involvement of members of the military as political dissidents. Until this point Brazilians, both civilians and military, shared a sense of pride in the nation's political stability and for having avoided the caudillos, coups, military dictatorships and rebellions that characterized neighboring countries. Their perception of the superiority of the Brazilian political system was attributed to an established tradition <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>control</b> over the military. And the ministers who held the War and Navy portfolios in the cabinet were, with rare exceptions, civilians.|$|E

25|$|According to Huntington {{and early}} studies of civil-military relationships, it is {{considered}} that effective civil- military relations {{should be in the}} form <b>of</b> objective <b>civilian</b> <b>control</b> over their armed forces. This control is indicated by the following factors; (1) the military's adoption of professional ethos and their recognition of boundaries of professional roles, (2) effective subordination of the military to civilian political leadership that formulates strategic directives on foreign and military policies, (3) recognition and approval from political leaders to the professional authorities and autonomy of the military and (4) minimal intervention of the military in politics and of politicians in military affairs.|$|R

2500|$|A [...] common {{issue that}} hinders many civil-military {{relations}} is when civil political leaders attempt to resume or gain {{a certain degree}} <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>control</b> {{after a period of}} transition, conflict or dictatorship, but do not possess the necessary capacities and commitment to handle defense affairs. What should happen in such transitions is that when military figures begin to be withdrawn from political positions in order to achieve some balance, is that civilian politicians should be taught to deal with policy formulation and given an oversight on the defense sector so as to efficiently replace the former military leaders. However, civilian control over the military, despite the efforts that have been made over the past years, has yet to become institutionalized in many countries.|$|E
2500|$|The open {{insurgency}} between 1920 and 1935 of airmen foreseeing a {{need for}} an independent air force {{in order to develop}} fully the potential of airpower had cost the careers of two of its near-legendary lights, Foulois and Mitchell, and nearly cost the reputation of two others, Pratt and Henry H. Arnold. In terms of the principle <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>control</b> of the military in peacetime, their tactics and behavior were clearly inappropriate. The political struggle had temporarily alienated supporters in Congress, had been counterproductive of the development of the Air Corps in the short run, and had hardened the opposition of an already antagonistic General Staff. [...] But through their mistakes and repeated rebuffs, the airmen had learned what they were lacking to prove the argument that the Air Corps could perform a unique mission—strategic bombardment—and the real threat of another world war would soon reverse their fortunes.|$|E
2500|$|If Huntington's imperatives are the {{independent}} variables, then the variable <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>control</b> becomes in turn an explanatory variable for military security. However, Huntington says that both societal imperatives, ideology and structure, are unchanging, {{at least in}} the American case. If that is the case, then the functional imperative is fully explanatory for changes in civilian control and subsequently military security. In short, if external threats are low, liberal ideology [...] "extirpates" [...] or eliminates military forces. If external threats are high, liberal ideology produces a [...] "transmutation" [...] effect that will re-create the military in accordance with liberalism, but in such a form that it will lose its [...] "peculiarly military characteristics." [...] Transmutation will work for short periods, such as to fight a war, but will not, over time, assure military security. This appears to explain well the pattern of American militarization and demobilization, at least until the initiation of the Cold War.|$|E

5000|$|One {{critical}} question in civil-military relations theory {{is how to}} determine {{the conditions under which}} the military will intervene in the domestic politics of the nation.

We propose an explanation for one key aspect of this variation: why does parliament enjoy veto power over military deployments in some democracies but not in others?
