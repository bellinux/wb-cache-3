40|$|Leptin gene (LEP), {{the product}} of which is an {{important}} factor controlling body weight, fat reserve and feed intake, is of great interest for geneticists (XIE et al., 1999; KURYŁ, 2000). Due to different <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> breeds and distinct objectives of their breeding, a question arises whether the polymorphism of leptin is going to be also characteristic for horses depending on their breed and utility type?

40|$|In {{our study}} <b>of</b> the <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> {{domestic}} <b>horses,</b> published in 1998, {{my colleagues and}} I examined sequence data of the mitochondrial DNA control region from 29 individuals, including Przewalski's horse and 14 domestic breeds (1). We found virtual genetic constancy within Przewalski's horse, unsurprising considering its severe historical bottlenecking, but {{a great deal of}} variation within and among domestic breeds. We wrote, “Overall, the amount of sequence divergence among modern breeds is greater than could have arisen within any plausible timescale of domestication (approximately 5, 000 years by current archaeological estimates), and clearly reflects more ancient haplotype diversity. ” We concluded, “The extent of modern haplotype diversity probably reflects an input of wild animals from different areas. It is unlikely that all domestic horses sprang from a single, local population. Domestic horses arose from wild stock distributed over a moderately extensive geographical region, large enough to have contained within it considerable pre-existing haplotype diversity. ” Carles Vilà and co-authors undertook a similar analysis, incorporating some of our data, and drew essentially the same conclusions (Reports, “Widespread <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> domestic <b>horse</b> lineages, ” 19 Jan., p. 474).

30|$|Although the {{background}} <b>of</b> the <b>horses</b> {{is not completely}} known, it can be assumed that the animals came from different areas of Germany. Since no fattening farms exist in Germany (Gudehus 2006), the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> slaughtered <b>horses</b> largely differ. In particular, age and field of use (e.g. sports or leisure riding, reproduction) <b>of</b> the <b>horses</b> vary (Gudehus 2006). The horses chosen for the present investigation might therefore represent the situation regarding the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> meat producing <b>horses</b> in Germany. However, the observed individual variations in the element concentrations in the equine liver and kidneys indicate differences in the exposure <b>of</b> the <b>horses</b> to environmental contaminants and dietary mineral supply. With regard {{to the use of}} equine by-products in the food chain, variations in the uptake of specific environmental contaminants and trace elements by the ingestion of equine organs can be assumed and should be considered for risk assessment in human and animal nutrition.|$|R

40|$|For several decades, the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> {{domestic}} <b>horses</b> {{has been}} the focus of research across multiple disciplines, yet many aspects <b>of</b> the <b>horse</b> domestication process remain poorly understood. One of the reasons for the difficulty in establishing a coherent scenario <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> domestication is that archaeological, mtDNA, and Y chromosome data have yielded ambiguous results, possibly because each class of markers reflects different aspects of the domestication process. In this thesis, I use large autosomal genetic datasets from horses sampled across Eurasia to investigate the <b>origin</b> and spread <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> domestication. I begin by characterising genetic diversity <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> from the Eurasian steppes and neighbouring regions, thus laying the groundwork for a more thorough analysis into the demographic history <b>of</b> <b>horses.</b> I then investigate the <b>origin</b> and mode <b>of</b> spread <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> domestication in the Eurasian steppe region using a spatially explicit genetic model. I show that horse domestication was initiated in the western part of the steppes, and that the spread <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> domestication involved both movement of domestic herds and extensive recruitment <b>of</b> wild <b>horses</b> from across this vast region, a scenario which integrates both archaeological and molecular evidence. Having established the route of spread <b>of</b> early domestic <b>horses</b> out <b>of</b> their domestication <b>origin</b> in the western steppe, I go on to investigate the routes and levels of gene flow among Eastern Eurasian horse populations post-domestication. I show that the ancient Silk Roads have played an important role in shaping the genetic structure <b>of</b> Eastern Eurasian <b>horses,</b> facilitating gene flow across deserts and high mountain chains. Finally, I provide further compelling evidence for the persistence <b>of</b> wild <b>horses</b> in the Iberian Peninsula throughout the Holocene period, and the substantial contribution of these local populations to the gene pool <b>of</b> Iberian domestic <b>horses.</b> Together, my results provide a coherent picture <b>of</b> the <b>origin</b> and spread <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> domestication, integrating for the first time previous evidence from archaeology, mtDNA and Y chromosome sequence data...|$|R

40|$|The reprinting <b>of</b> The <b>Horse</b> in Blackfoot Indian Culture {{makes it}} {{possible}} {{for a new generation of}} plains anthropologists and historians to savor this book, long a basic reference. When Ewers began fieldwork on the Blackfoot Reservation in 1941, one of his concerns was the description of the role <b>of</b> the <b>horse</b> in Blackfoot and Plains Indian culture. Although concerned primarily with the Blackfoot, he also assembled pertinent ethnographic and historical data from other tribes. Beginning with a general review of the acquisition <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> by North American Indians, the first chapter ends with a discussion of the acquisition <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> by the Blackfoot, suggesting that they must have been acquired from a friendly tribe who taught horsemanship and horse breeding and provided other information necessary to the care and use <b>of</b> <b>horses.</b> Care <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> includes pasturage, winter protection, remedies for sores and illnesses, and care in old age. Horse training was important, too. A wide variety of gear was used with horses, including several different kinds of saddles, stirrups, bridles, and decorations. The use <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> for transportation also required various kinds of equipment, from harnessing travois to saddlebags. Perhaps the sections with more general appeal are those that discuss the use of the horsein moving camp, in hunting, in warfare, in trade, in recreation, in social relations, and in religion. The discussion of the use <b>of</b> the <b>horse</b> in hunting includes hunting methods, the number of buffalo killed in a single chase, hunting accidents, and other details. The horse was an important indicator of wealth and status and had a place in the ceremonial life of the Blackfoot. The final section returns to the issue <b>of</b> the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the <b>horse</b> complex on the plains. From his study of the use <b>of</b> the <b>horse</b> among the Blackfoot and other plains tribes, Ewers builds a list of traits which he believes are generally found among the Plains Indians as part <b>of</b> the <b>horse</b> complex. Although he lists 119 traits, he notes that more comparative data would make his conclusions more reliable. He suggests, however, that since most of the traits were widely shared among the plains tribes, horses must have diffused via friendly tribes who shared their knowledge with the people to whom they gave or traded <b>horses.</b> Some <b>of</b> these traits were obviously acquired from the Europeans and were always associated with the horse; therefore it is more correct to speak of the diffusion <b>of</b> the <b>horse</b> complex or the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the <b>horse</b> complex than <b>of</b> the <b>horse</b> itself. The major criticism of the book concerns its failure to include the native terms for the many objects and ideas that are described. For example, saddles are identified by the English translation of the Blackfoot terms, 2 ̆ 2 pad saddle, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 wood saddle, 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 prairie chicken snare saddle. 2 ̆ 2 For people interested in ethnoscience and linguistics, the native terms would also be useful. It would seem, too, that the native terms might also provide data pertinent to the question <b>of</b> the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the <b>horse</b> complex on the plains, since some of the terms may have been shared as part of the complex. Despite this criticism, however, the book is a 2 ̆ 2 classic, 2 ̆ 2 and this reasonably priced edition belongs on the shelf of every serious student of the Plains Indians...|$|R
