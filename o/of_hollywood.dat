5|$|A similar {{depiction}} <b>of</b> <b>Hollywood</b> {{appears in}} Nathanael West's novel The Day of the Locust (1939), which many critics see {{as an important}} precursor to Barton Fink.

It portrays Hollywood as crass and exploitative, devouring talented individuals in its neverending quest for profit. In both West's novel and Barton Fink, protagonists suffer under the oppressive industrial machine of the movie studio.|$|E

5|$|Co-writer Theroux {{revealed}} that the initial script concept was to have actors go to a mock boot camp and return with posttraumatic stress disorder. The final script was developed to satirize Vietnam War films such as Apocalypse Now, Rambo, Missing in Action, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Hamburger Hill, and The Deer Hunter. Theroux pointed out that since viewers had an increased awareness of the inner workings <b>of</b> <b>Hollywood</b> due to celebrity websites and Hollywood news sources, the script was easier to write. Dialogue for unscripted portions of the storyboard was developed on set by the actors or was improvised.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich's {{reputation}} suffered {{further damage}} when his imagery {{was adopted by}} a number <b>of</b> <b>Hollywood</b> directors, such as Walt Disney, built {{on the work of}} such German cinema masters as Fritz Lang and F. W. Murnau, within the horror and fantasy genres. His rehabilitation was slow, but enhanced through the writings of such critics and scholars as Werner Hofmann, Helmut Börsch-Supan and Sigrid Hinz, who successfully rejected and rebutted the political associations ascribed to his work, and placed it within a purely art-historical context. By the 1970s, he was again being exhibited in major galleries across the world, as he found favour with a new generation of critics and art historians.|$|E
