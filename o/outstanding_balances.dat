50|$|The sum of {{the daily}} <b>outstanding</b> <b>balances</b> is divided {{by the number of}} days covered in the cycle to give an average balance for that period.

The resultant interest is the same as if interest was charged at the close of each day, except that it only compounds (gets added to the principal) once per month. It is the simplest of the four methods {{in the sense that it}} produces an interest rate approximating if not exactly equal the expected rate.|$|E

50|$|The {{outbreak}} of war {{at the end}} of July 1914 abruptly ended Pontresina's hotel boom. Despite Switzerland's political and military neutrality, the country was greatly impacted by the war, especially in respect of those industries, such as high-end tourism, most of whose customers came from countries, such as Germany and England, that were among the leading belligerent powers. The supply of hotel guests dried up and it quickly became clear that the financial survival of Pontresina's hotels was threatened not simply because of the high proportion of running costs that were fixed costs (incurred regardless of occupancy levels), but also because of indebtedness left over from the boom years, as loans fell due for repayment and interest on <b>outstanding</b> <b>balances</b> remained payable.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the last}} few years of his life, John Maynard Keynes was much preoccupied with the {{question}} of balance in international trade. He was the leader of the British delegation to the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference in 1944 that established the Bretton Woods system of international currency management.He was the principal author of a proposal - the so-called Keynes Plan - for an International Clearing Union.

5000|$|The sari-sari store also {{saves the}} {{customer}} extra transportation costs, {{especially those in}} rural areas, since some towns can be very far from the nearest market or grocery. The store {{also serves as a}} secondary or even primary source of income for the shopkeepers. The owners can buy commodities in bulk in groceries then sell them in the store at a mark-up price. Trucks usually deliver LPG and soft drinks to the store itself. The store requires little investment since the products are cheap and only a few modifications on one side of a house are needed to convert it to a sari-sari store. The sari-sari store also allows credit purchases from its [...] "suki" [...] (repeat customers known to the store owners). They usually keep a record of their customers' <b>outstanding</b> <b>balances</b> on a school notebook and demand payments on paydays.|$|E

According to the Geo TV, under Factory Act 1934, the owner {{will have to pay}} only Rs. 5000 in penalty over negligence in the protection of workers. The leader of Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N), Nawaz Sharif has announced Rs. 300,000 in aid to the families of those killed in this incident. On 13 September it was reported that the Sind provincial government would offer financial compensation of Rs. 500,000s {{to the families of the}} dead victims and Rs. 50,000 to those who had been injured, while the city's power utility company, KESC, announced they would waive all <b>outstanding</b> <b>balances</b> of the victims as a goodwill gesture. Sindh Chief Minister Syed Qaim Ali Shah also announced further compensation of Rs. 300,000 for the families of the dead and Rs. 50,000 for those who had been injured.|$|E
5000|$|As stated above, {{individuals}} with HDHPs often forgo or delay care {{due to increased}} cost sharing, and this often leads to patients presenting to health care providers and institutions later on in much worse condition. This pattern has {{a significant effect on}} the supply side of health care. Hospitals and health care institutions take on increasing amounts of bad debt with the advent of HDHP as patients exhaust their unaffordable deductibles soon after being admitted for care and default on <b>outstanding</b> <b>balances.</b> With rise in cost sharing, hospitals are collecting more money directly from the patients, from 2011 to 2014, the number of consumer payments to health care providers increased 193 percent {{according to a study by}} to the [...] "Trends in Healthcare Payments Fifth Annual Report: 2014" [...] from InstaMed. From a physician/hospital supply, HDHP have forced institutions to become more consumer conscious as patients (due to price shopping) do their own research and understand their options. If patients with HDHPs forgo primary care, this lessens the volume and revenue they are able to generate. It also means that, later on, the burden and intensity of care per episode is much greater. The same goes for specialists as well who see less patients undergoing preventative screening and maintenance care (colonoscopies, mammograms, routine laboratory testing, etc.) and then end up with serious (and preventable) conditions.  In the long term, the cost and burden is invariably greater. Physicians struggle with having cost become a greater reason for opting for or against a medical interaction or procedure than the health benefits for the individual.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the result}} of the sale is a credit balance on the account, this amount must be repaid to the consumer. If there is a debit balance, the credit {{provider}} may demand and, if necessary, sue the consumer for the <b>outstanding</b> <b>balance.</b>|$|R
50|$|Adjusted Balance Method: Method used by {{a credit}} card issuer to compute the balance on which a debtor must pay interest.
