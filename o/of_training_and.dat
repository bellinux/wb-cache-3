She docked in Santo Domingo on 2 May and exchanged her cargo for 450 more evacuees {{to be taken to}} San Juan. In all, Yancey carried almost a quarter of those fleeing the Dominican Republic. She returned to Norfolk soon thereafter, and resumed her role <b>of</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> cruising off the eastern seaboard and into the Caribbean basin. On 1 January 1969, Yancey was redesignated as LKA-93.|$|E
5|$|By July 1940 the {{situation}} had improved somewhat with uniforms, a modicum <b>of</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> the arrival {{of hundreds of thousands}} of rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition from the USA. New weapons were developed that could be produced cheaply without consuming materials that were needed to produce armaments for the regular units. An early example was the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenade (a glass bottle filled with highly flammable material of which more than six million were made), and the No. 73 Grenade (an anti-tank grenade resembling a Thermos flask).|$|E
5|$|Following {{this the}} 27th Battalion {{returned}} to Egypt, where the AIF undertook a period <b>of</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> re-organisation as reinforcements arrived from Australia. During {{this time the}} AIF was expanded from two infantry divisions to four– with a fifth forming in Australia– and many infantry battalions that had seen service at Gallipoli were split up to provide cadre staff for the newly raised battalions. The battalions of the 2nd Division, however, were not split up in this manner and the 27th Battalion remained intact.|$|E

5|$|After {{a period}} of {{rudimentary}} training in Australia, the first contingent of the AIF departed by ship in a single convoy from Albany on 1 November 1914. Although they were originally bound for England to undergo further training prior to employment on the Western Front, the Australians were instead sent to British-controlled Egypt in order to pre-empt any Turkish attack against the strategically important Suez Canal, and {{with a view to}} opening another front against the Central Powers. Aiming to knock Turkey out of the war the British then decided to stage an amphibious lodgement at Gallipoli and following a period <b>of</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> reorganisation the Australians were included amongst the British, Indian and French forces committed to the campaign. The combined Australian and New Zealand Army Corps—commanded by British general William Birdwood—subsequently landed at Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli peninsula on 25 April 1915. Although promising to transform the war if successful, the Gallipoli Campaign was ill-conceived and shortly after the landing a blood stalemate developed. This ultimately lasted eight months before Allied commanders decided to evacuate the troops without having achieved the campaign's objectives. Australian casualties totalled 26,111, including 8,141 killed.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} service, both {{ships were}} assigned to the Atlantic Fleet. The ships took part in the normal routine <b>of</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> fleet maneuvers off the east coast of the United States and in the Caribbean, interspersed with periodic maintenance. Both ships toured the Mediterranean in late 1913, making stops in Italy and France, among others. In April 1914, Arkansas was involved in the occupation of Veracruz during the Mexican Revolution, and Wyoming arrived later to support the operation. Two men from Arkansas earned the Medal of Honor for their actions during the initial occupation of the city. After the United States declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917, Wyoming, {{along with the rest of}} Battleship Division 9 (BatDiv 9), steamed to Britain to reinforce the Royal Navy's Grand Fleet, stationed in Scapa Flow. Arkansas initially remained in the United States, training gun crews for the expanding wartime fleet. In July 1918, she too was sent to Britain. Neither ship saw action during the war, though they were present when the German High Seas Fleet surrendered in November 1918.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose of {{the study}} was to assess effects of air {{pollution}} on hemoglobin concentration <b>of</b> <b>trained</b> <b>and</b> un-trained school-going boys of West Bengal. Sample consisted of 60 footballers, 60 sprinters, 127 untrained boys, subdivided into two groups from two zones namely Tollygunge and Sonarpur. Air concentration of SPM, RPM, SO 2, NO 2 were moni-tored for both zones. Height, weight, BSA, BMI and Hemoglobin concentration were measured. Results revealed that pollutant concen-trations were significantly higher in Tollygunge than Sonarpur. Hemoglobin concentration of untrained boys was significantly higher than footballers in both regions but no significant difference were observed when compared with sprinters. Hemoglobin concentra-tion <b>of</b> both <b>trained</b> <b>and</b> untrained boys <b>of</b> Sonarpur was significantly higher than Tollygunge.

5|$|Although many squadrons {{were raised}} at RAAF Station Laverton during World WarII, the base's prime focus {{continued}} to be its aircraft depot.

A written statement by the Afghan government denied the 'systematic' nature of torture and claimed the report was exaggerated, although it admitted to deficiencies {{due to a lack}} <b>of</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> resources. The report also suggested that detainees handed over by the CF received different treatment, with one case citing a man who stated everyone was treated badly unless they were handled by Canadians.|$|E
