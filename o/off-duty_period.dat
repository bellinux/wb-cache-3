40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the difference in diurnal variation of autonomic control between young male mild to moderate hypertensive and normotensive white-collar workers, we accessed heart rate variability with ambulatory blood pressure for over 24 hours including work and sleep periods. Both mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP and DBP) were significantly (p< 0. 01) higher in hypertensives (HT, n= 11) than normotensives (NT, n= 11) in all phases, whereas heart rate was not different between them in any phase. Blood pressures during work period (on-duty) {{were significantly higher than}} those during non-work period (off-duty) in both NT and HT. High frequency (HF; 0. 15 – 0. 40 Hz) power showed a circadian pattern in phase with the sleep-wake cycle. Both HF and low frequency (LF; 0. 05 – 0. 15 Hz) powers in HT were significantly lower than that in NT during the sleep period (p< 0. 05). LF/HF ratio showed a circadian pattern that was almost opposite of the pattern in HF power. Twenty-four-hour average LF/HF in HT was higher than that in NT (p< 0. 05). Especially during on-duty, LF/HF in HT was significantly higher than in NT (p< 0. 05). The increase of SBP and LF/HF from <b>off-duty</b> <b>period</b> to on-duty period (∆SBP and ∆LF/HF) showed significant positive correlation (r= 0. 67, P< 0. 05) in HT group, suggesting that the SBP elevation during on-duty in HT may be coupled with sympathetic activation. These results suggest that HT showed significantl...|$|E

500|$|Trucks {{equipped}} with GPS satellite navigation units have enabled drivers to forgo a traditional paper-based map, saving time and effort. Drivers {{willing to pay}} for satellite radio [...] or who work for a company that pays for it can listen to commercial-free music, sports, news, and talk radio coast-to-coast without interruption of signals between cities (as terrestrial radio signals are limited to a certain radius from the broadcasting tower).

50|$|Battledress {{features}} {{show little}} change from their wartime originals, except that other ranks were now permitted to wear collar and tie on <b>off-duty</b> <b>periods.</b> The practice of wearing regimental sleeve badges with rank insignia {{adopted by the}} 1st Lothians corporals and above in the early 1940s was discontinued. Officers' service-dress reverted to the pre-war pattern with box-pleated pockets reappearing on the skirts of the tunic. With the return of peacetime conditions, a No. 1 Dress in dark blue was re-adopted, similar in form to that worn before the war. The officers' version was set-off with a French-grey stand-up collar. By {{the time of the}} Coronation in 1953, the features of this No. 1 Dress had altered considerably and illustrated, in the case of other ranks, both the horsed and mechanized eras of the regiment's history. Shoulder-straps were replaced by chains and the twin bands of scarlet separated by piping were restored to the trouser-seams. In the case of officers, the black beret was displaced by a peaked forage cap, similar in appearance to that worn around the start of the 20th century. This had a shiny peak, a head-band faced in scarlet and the seam on the crown was enhanced with piping in the same colour. Overalls were re-introduced, worn over Wellingtons with spurs.|$|R
5|$|On December 27, 2011 (76 FR 81133), FMCSA {{published}} a final rule amending its hours-of-service (HOS) regulations for drivers of property-carrying commercial motor vehicles (CMVs). The final rule adopted several {{changes to the}} HOS regulations, including a new provision requiring drivers to take a rest break during the work day under certain circumstances. Drivers may drive a CMV only if 8 hours or less have passed {{since the end of}} the driver’s last <b>off-duty</b> or sleeper-berth <b>period</b> of at least 30 minutes. FMCSA did not specify when drivers must take the 30-minute break, but the rule requires that they wait no longer than 8 hours after the last <b>off-duty</b> or sleeper-berth <b>period</b> of that length or longer to take the break. Drivers who already take shorter breaks during the work day could comply with the rule by taking one of the shorter breaks and extending it to 30 minutes. The new requirement took effect on July 1, 2013.|$|R
40|$|Based on {{input from}} {{representatives of the}} Short Line Railroad Association (ASLRRA) it is {{apparent}} that there is an issue with the impact of the hours of Service rules as generated by the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 that creates difficulty for short line railroad operators during peak harvest season. Since the service demands are very extreme it is difficult for crews to operate within the time constraints. Consequently, {{there is a need to}} address ways to assist operating crews in better managing the fatigue associated with long hours of work. The Hours of Service law (HSL), first enacted in 1907 and most recently amended in 2008, control how many hours train employees, dispatching service employees, and signal employees may work. The statute provides maximum on-duty periods for each group of employees, minimum <b>off-duty</b> <b>periods</b> for train employees and signal employees, and establishes how time on duty is to be calculated. The statute also provides additional limitations on consecutive-days and certain monthly limitations on the activity of train employees. In the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008, FRA received regulatory authority to establish hours of service limitations for train employees providing commuter and intercity rail passenger transportation service and on August 12, 2011, FRA published its final rule providing new limitations for passenger train employees which necessitated the evaluation of work schedules for risk of fatigue. In previous studies in railroad operational settings crew work schedules were analyzed to determine the extent to which persons working long hours were experiencing excessive levels of fatigue. Based on extensive research the FRA determined various cutoffs that suggested that individuals who exceed such cutoffs were more likely to be at risk for accidents and injur...|$|R
40|$|International audienceResearch {{indicates}} that suicide rates are high {{among members of}} law enforcement. Our objectives were: (1) to determine life events implicated in suicide mortality among French law enforcement; and (2) to describe the different life trajectories of police officers who deceased by suicide. All suicides of police officers which occurred during 2008 (n= 49) were explored using the psychological autopsy method. Key informants were: a supervisor, a colleague {{and a member of}} the family or a close friend. Each of them were interviewed by trained psychologists using standardized questionnaires exploring: sociodemographic characteristics, life events, social integration and support, health service use, mental health with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview short form (CIDI-SF), occupational stress with the Spielberger Inventory, impulsiveness with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale and aggressiveness with the Brown-Goodwin Lifetime Aggression Scale. Information was then summarized in a timetable life trajectory of all life areas. All cases were finally appraised by at least two experts in order to identify the determinants of the suicide and to determine psychiatric diagnoses. For each period of time, a burdensomeness score was determined, from 6 (no adversity) to 1 (adversities in each sphere of life). Of the 49  cases of suicide, two were excluded and 39 were investigated and appraised (response rate: 39 / 47 = 83 %). Eighty-two percent of the suicide cases were men and the mean age at death was 35 years. In more than half of the cases, police officers used their service weapon to commit suicide. All deceased police officers were suffering from mental health symptoms (primarily depression). Of them, two thirds had used healthcare for this distress. The main other cause of suicide was problems in the married life (70 % of the cases). Four distinct types of life trajectories of adversities could be identified by a qualitative analysis. It is the first time such a study was performed in France, and results are concordant with those of the literature. This study showed that all deceased police officers were suffering from mental disorders and that there was not one single profile of life trajectory: screening and support of police officers in distress need to be prioritized. Moreover, results suggested that the availability of the service weapon during <b>off-duty</b> <b>periods</b> should be reconsidered. This study helped the Home ministry to elaborate and improve strategies to prevent suicide among police officers...|$|R
