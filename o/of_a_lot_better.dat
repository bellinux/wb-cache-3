Pervasive Computing (Ubiquitous Computing) is a fact that every one must assume, and even though ethical and moral topics will always arise. There are unlimited aspects and usual tasks in which Pervasive Computing can improve our quality of life. One {{of the ways in which}} this recently emerging field can help us the most on making the quality of life <b>of</b> people <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>better,</b> is on our feeding habits and all their related aspects: nutrition, physical activities, emotions and social interaction. Some of these environments are what this project intends to improve. One of the most evident problems for which we could be interested in logging every bit of the diet of one person would be overweight. People who clearly need help on their nutrition and all the habits related to it (like physical activities, emotions and social interaction), could get an incredible benefit. Using a device or some interconnected devices which are able to monitor and record different kind of information, could help them overcome their habits, and solve their weight problems. But, ultimately, every person, even without any evident nutrition problem, could also take a great advantage from a device like that...|$|R

[...] At Music Is My Oxygen, Rob Burkhardt rated the album three out of five stars, noting the album has good material that touches on many topics which the likes of Luke Bryan, Blake Shelton and Florida Georgia Line do, and this causes it to get lost amongst the others; however, he wrote that [...] "Days of Gold deserves to be heard, but Owen {{is going to have to}} dig a little deeper." ...|$|R

For Singularity 7 and such, I was doing all the art from a basic plot and then adding dialogue after the event. Now I write the whole thing out first, conversationally, and then map out the pages from there, just tweaking the dialogue at the end.

5000|$|When Ringo Starr {{collapsed}} with tonsillitis and was hospitalised on 3 June 1964, {{the eve of}} The Beatles' 1964 Australasian tour, the band's manager Brian Epstein {{and their}} producer George Martin urgently discussed the feasibility of using a stand-in drummer rather than cancelling part of the tour. Martin suggested Jimmie Nicol as he had recently used him on a recording session with Tommy Quickly. Nicol had also drummed on a 'Top Six' budget label album {{as part of an}} uncredited session band, as well as an extended play single (with three tracks on each side) of Beatles cover versions (marketed as 'Teenagers Choice' and entitled Beatlemania) which meant that he already knew the songs and their arrangements. Producer Bill Wellings and the aforementioned Shubdubs trumpeter Johnny Harris (freelancing here as an arranger and composer) were responsible for putting together alternative budget cover versions of songs taken from the British Hit Parade aimed at cash-strapped teenagers. Harris said: 'The idea was for me to try and guess which six songs would be topping the charts about a month ahead. I would do the arrangements and then go into the studio and record [...] "sound a-likes"; the first EP (extended play) released got to number 30 in the charts. Jimmie was on drums and, as you can imagine, we covered a lot of the Beatles' songs.' Although John Lennon and Paul McCartney quickly accepted the idea of using an understudy, George Harrison threatened {{to pull out of the}} tour telling Epstein and Martin: 'If Ringo's not going, then neither am I. You can find two replacements.' Martin recalled: 'They nearly didn't do the Australia tour. George is a very loyal person. It took all of Brian's and my persuasion to tell George that if he didn’t do it he was letting everybody down.' Tony Barrow, who was The Beatles' press officer at the time, later commented: 'Brian saw it as the lesser of two evils; cancel the tour and upset thousands of fans or continue and upset the Beatles.' Ringo: 'It was very strange, them going off without me. They’d taken Jimmie Nicol and I thought they didn’t love me any more - all that stuff went through my head.' The arrangements were made very quickly, from a telephone call to Nicol at his home in West London inviting him to attend an audition-rehearsal at Abbey Road Studios, to packing his bags, all in the same day. At a press conference a reporter mischievously asked John Lennon why Pete Best, who had been The Beatles' previous drummer for two years but dismissed by the group on the eve of stardom, was not being given the opportunity of replacing Ringo, to which Lennon replied: 'He's got his own group Best & the All Stars, and it might have looked as if we were taking him back, which is not good for him.' Later, on the subject of remuneration, Nicol recalled: 'When Brian Epstein talked of money in front of them McCartney and Harrison I got very, very nervous. They paid me £2,500 per gig and a £2,500 signing bonus. Now, that floored me. When John spoke up in a protest by saying [...] "Good God, Brian, you'll make the chap crazy!", I thought it was over. But no sooner had he said that when he said, 'Give him ten thousand!' Everyone laughed and I felt a hell <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>better.</b> That night I couldn't sleep a wink. I was a fucking Beatle!' These sums of money, which were vast in 1964, are unverified.|$|E

July 25, 1959 Mr. Richard Gosser International Vice President UAW-CIO 425 winthrop street Toledo, Ohio Dear Dick: This letter {{will contain}} {{information}} that I related to Ned Skeldon {{a few moments}} ago; lim sending it along so that you'll have it in writing, first-hand. In talking to {{some of my friends}} on the McClellan Committee staff, I learned that the subpoena which has been issued for your appearance and that of some of the other representativesof Local 12, is strictly the product of Republican partisanshipand is a pure and simple case of trying to smear you and some of the Democrats with whom the UAW has been friendly. The McClellan Committee itself, as a group, does not determine who is to be subpoenaed or called to appear before the Committee. Any member of the McClellan Committee, accord­ing to what I was told, has the right to request the issuance of a subpoena for anyone that the member wants to bring before the Committee for interrogation. Needless to say, this is a very different procedure than we have in the House. Here it takes the action of the entire Committee to subpoena witnesses. Although McClellan has acquiesced in the above procedure,he has insisted that information with respect to a subpoenaedwitness be presented to the entire Committee before a hearingis actually scheduled. I was told that Goldwater, Mundt, or whoever insisted on subpoenaing you and the others has declined thus far to furnish the Committee with any information. As a result, McClellan has refused to set a definite date for the hearings [...] postponing the hearing scheduled for next Mondayuntil August 4. I was told that he almost certainly would postpone it again unless the Committee is informed of the information upon which the subpoena was issued. The one thing that was most encouraging to me, Dick, was the outspoken antagonism of the Committee staff againstthe Republican members of the Committee who have insisted upon subpoenaing you. The staff members recognize that any information against you is of sufficiently old vintage that the charges are flat and that the only possible purpose can be to try to embarrass a few Democratic labor leaders [...] for a change. I was told that I would be kept informed on the situation and that I probably could find out in advance just what infor­mation will be developed in the event that you actually are forced to come to Washington. I was hope ful that I'd {{be able to get the}} Committee to tear up the subpoenas but this does not appear to be possible,the reason being that I don't stand a hell <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>better</b> with Goldwater or Mundt than you do. At any rate, that's the situ­ation. This takes best wishes. Sincerely yours, Thomas Ashley, M. C. TLA:kl...|$|E
