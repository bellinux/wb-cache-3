Several key questions relate to mechanisms of polar amplification and inter-hemispheric coupling on glacial/interglacial timescales. Here, we present the first results from a large set of global ocean–atmosphere climate model ‘snap-shot’ simulations covering the last 120   000 years using the Hadley Centre climate model (HadCM 3) at up to 1 kyr temporal resolution. Two sets of simulations were performed {{in order to examine}} the roles of orbit and greenhouse gases versus ice-sheet forcing of orbital-scale climate change. A series of idealised Heinrich events were also simulated, but no changes to aerosols or vegetation were prescribed. This paper focuses on high latitudes and inter-hemispheric linkages. The simulations reproduce polar temperature trends well compared to ice-core reconstructions, although the magnitude is underestimated. Polar amplification varies with obliquity, but this variability is dampened by including variations in land ice coverage, while the <b>overall</b> <b>amplification</b> <b>factor</b> increases. The relatively constant amplification of Antarctic temperatures (with ice-sheet forcing included) suggests it is possible to use Antarctic temperature reconstructions to estimate global changes (which are roughly half the magnitude). Atlantic Ocean overturning circulation varies considerably only with the introduction of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, but only weakens in the North Atlantic in the deep glacial, when ocean–sea-ice feedbacks result in the movement of the region of deep convection to lower latitudes and with the introduction of freshwater to the surface North Atlantic in order to simulate Heinrich events...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{catalytic}} system, {{which is}} able to translate a light signal into a chemical output with amplified response, was developed. The <b>overall</b> <b>amplification</b> <b>factor</b> is 15 after a reaction time of 20 min. Although its fidelity in terms of sensitivity and amplification is far from biological models, {{the results show that}} coupling optical and chemical processes allows for the processing and amplification of information. New fluorescent dyes containing alkyne- and azide-groups were synthesized. These compunds allow modular connection to a lot of substrates, such as labelling of proteins. Novel receptor building blocks for different binding motifs have been synthesized. Zn(II) -cyclen complexes for imide groups, bis-Zn(II) -cyclen complexes for phosphate groups, Zn(II) and Cu(II) nitrilo-triacetic acid complexes for N-terminal histidines, guanidines for carboxylic acids and a Zn(II) -porphyrin for non-polar regions on a protein surface. All compounds bear either an azide or an alkyne function and therefore can be connected in any combination using the Cu(I) -catalyzed cycloaddition. A biological relevant pentapeptide, with a histidine and a carboxyl-group as possible binding motifs, has been used as target in a kinetically controlled target guided reaction. In order to identify a bidentate receptor with a high binding constant for the target, combinations of Zn(II) - and Cu(II) -NTA complexes and guanidines have been tested in this reaction. Hit-detection was performed in situ with MS-spectroscopy. Results revealed one possible high affinity receptor out of 12 combinations. Six bidentate receptors have been synthesized and their binding interactions with the peptide target have been investigated with NMR- MS- and fluorescence-spectroscopy. All methods confirmed binding interactions. Results of NMR-investigations allowed a prediction of the structural relations of the formed complex between target and receptor. This prediction was confirmed by Spartan-calculations. Further, the association constant of this complex was determined with fluorescence spectroscopy to be in the micro molar range. However, a definite determination, as well as a comparison of the association constants of these six receptors was not possible. Fluorescent labelled N-terminal histidines, with a dansyl- or a fluorescein group have been synthesized. The binding interactions between the histidine-moiety and heavy metal cations as well as Cu(II) -NTA complexes has been investigated with fluorescence spectroscopy. Results revealed high association constants (> 1011 L 2 /mol 2) of these indicators towards Cu 2 + and Cu(II) -NTA complexes. Therefore, these indicators can be used in very sensitive detection assays for Cu(II) and corresponding complexes. Using the Cu(I) -catalyzed cycloaddition, several bidentate receptor molecules with different binding sites have been synthesized. Combinations of receptor building blocks were: bis-Zn(II) -cyclen-complexes with Zn(II) -NTA-complexes or guanidine compounds and further a Cu(II) -NTA- with a Zn(II) -porphyrin complex. The binding interactions between the bis-Zn(II) -cyclen compounds and phosphorylated peptides were investigated with a fluorescence polarisation assay. Results confirmed a slight increase of the binding affinity (factor 2) compared to a monodentate bis-Zn(II) -cyclen reference compound. The binding interactions between the Zn(II) -porphyrin-Cu(II) -NTA complex and amino acids, a pentapeptide and two His-containing proteins (HEL and Myo) were investigated with fluorescence titrations. Results showed a specific binding of histidine as well as of peptides with an N-terminal His. Binding affinities were in the micromolar range. The binding affinities of the porphyrine receptor towards His-containing proteins revealed to be also in the micromolar range, but unspecific. New 1, 1 �-disubstituted [4, 4 �]-bitriazole compounds have been synthesized using the Cu(I) -catalyzed cycloaddition between 1, 4 -butadiyne and various alkyl- and aryl-triazoles.

Typical sediment soil stratigraphies in Makassar were investigated. They can be categorized as model 1 with a 12 m thick of silty sand overlying 10 m thick of clay before reaching claystone; model 2 with a 11 m silty clay overlying tuff layer, and model 3 with a 10 m clay overlying claystone layer. The DSHA was performed by considering two seismic sources affecting the city, involving Fault Walanae Mw 6. 6 with 89 km and Makassar Thrust Mw 6. 8 with 149 km distance from the city. Spectral matching was conducted in which actual time histories obtained from shallow crustal earthquakes with similar seismic characteristics. They were matched with target response spectrum obtained from DSHA. The matched time history was then used as input ground motion with a target PGA of 0. 11 g, into the equivalent linear approximation of non-linear response with the use of EERA software. Our findings show that buildings which are located on the ground with typical stratigraphy of thick silty sand layer overlying thick clay layer, generates a broader response spectral acceleration with two summits. On the other hand, buildings, which are located on the ground with a thick clay layer overlying claystone layer, yields a focused response spectral acceleration with one summit. In general, the maximum spectral acceleration was found at range of 0. 598 g (at the period of 0. 3 s) up to 0. 74 g (at the period of 0. 5 s). The model stratigraphy 3 has the largest spectral acceleration compared to the Models 1 and 2. <b>Overall,</b> the <b>amplification</b> <b>factor</b> for Makassar was found at a range of 1. 3 to 1. 92.

The beams were studied for three end conditions, with two lengths per end condition and two magnitudes of point loads per length. The {{method of analysis}} was performed using geometrically non-linear analysis. Material nonlinear analysis was not considered. This method of analysis, {{which is based on}} Eulerian (corotational) formulation and includes thermal effects, was published by Kassimali and Garcilazo (2010). Graphical results are shown for the {{response of}} the beams. The results are also compared to published values given in the AISC manual. 	The following conclusions were shown from this study: 1) 	When comparing the <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> (both deflection and bending moment) found in this study to the <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> given in the AISC manual, the data shows similar values in the pre-buckling region. However, once the temperature is raised high enough and the beam enters the post-buckling region, significant difference in the <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> can be seen. The beams in this study showed that the <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> do not increase greatly during post-buckling. The values given in the AISC manual on the other hand show an indefinite increase in <b>amplification</b> <b>factor</b> once the buckling stage is reached. It is thought that this decrease in <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> in post-buckling is due to the increased strength in the beams from catenary forces that are developed. 2) 	When comparing similar beams (same end conditions and same lateral loads), the length of the beam will {{play a role in the}} lateral response to thermal loading. It was consistently shown in all end support conditions that the shorter beams developed higher <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> compared to the longer beams.

The beams with the lighter lateral loads would develop higher <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> than the heavier loaded beams. As with the length, the lateral loads didn’t have much difference until the beams would approach the critical temperature.

Dynamic <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> were subsequently calculated from strains and deflections obtained from independent static and dynamic simulations. The simulation of numerous scenarios enabled the evaluation of the influence of different parameters on the dynamic response of a deck slab: The road surface roughness was found {{to be one of the}} most important parameters, with an increase in roughness leading to an increase in dynamic <b>amplification</b> <b>factors.</b> An overloaded truck produces a lower dynamic <b>amplification</b> <b>factor</b> in a deck slab than an empty truck. The truck speed influences the dynamic interaction, but a clear relationship between speed and dynamic <b>amplification</b> <b>factor</b> could not be identified. The maximum dynamic <b>amplification</b> <b>factor</b> does not vary significantly from one point to another over a deck slab in a girder bridge. The structural arrangement of a deck slab in a girder bridge has little influence on dynamic <b>amplification</b> <b>factors.</b> <b>Overall,</b> the different deck slabs on the girder bridges studied were all equally sensitive to the dynamic effects of road traffic. In many cases considered for the framed slab bridge, the maximum dynamic <b>amplification</b> <b>factor</b> was found to occur over the supports. For such bridges, the sensitivity of the deck slab to the dynamic effects of road traffic is not uniform. Finally, two approaches to evaluating deck slabs of existing road bridges are proposed. The first approach is only applicable in certain situations and involves a simplified evaluation using an updated traffic load model and a dynamic <b>amplification</b> <b>factor.</b> In situations where a simplified evaluation is not applicable, the second approach is to evaluate a deck slab using numerical or experimental analyses...|$|R
