2500|$|A {{commonly}} proposed {{approach to}} ensuring fail-safe beam targeting {{is to use}} a retrodirective phased array antenna/rectenna. A [...] "pilot" [...] microwave beam emitted {{from the center of the}} rectenna on the ground establishes a phase front at the transmitting antenna. There, circuits in each of the antenna's subarrays compare the pilot beam's phase front with an internal clock phase to control the phase of the <b>outgoing</b> <b>signal.</b> This forces the transmitted beam to be centered precisely on the rectenna and to have a high degree of phase uniformity; if the pilot beam is lost for any reason (if the transmitting antenna is turned away from the rectenna, for example) the phase control value fails and the microwave power beam is automatically defocused. Such a system would be physically incapable of focusing its power beam anywhere that did not have a pilot beam transmitter. The long-term effects of beaming power through the ionosphere in the form of microwaves has yet to be studied, but nothing has been suggested which might lead to any significant effect.|$|E

5000|$|The {{fundamental}} principle {{is that of}} impedance matching. The incoming signal is applied to both the telephone line and a [...] "balancing network" [...] {{that is designed to}} have the same impedance as the line. The <b>outgoing</b> <b>signal</b> is derived by subtracting the two, thus canceling the incoming signal from the <b>outgoing</b> <b>signal.</b> Early hybrids were made with transformers configured as hybrid coils that had an extra winding that could be connected out of phase. The name hybrid comes from these special mixed-winding transformers.|$|E

50|$|A ganglionic blocker (or ganglioplegic) {{is a type}} of {{medication}} that inhibits transmission between preganglionic and postganglionic neurons in the Autonomic Nervous System, often by acting as a nicotinic receptor antagonist. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are found on skeletal muscle, but also within the route of transmission for the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system (which together comprise the autonomic nervous system). More specifically, nicotinic receptors are found within the ganglia of the autonomic nervous system, allowing <b>outgoing</b> <b>signals</b> to be transmitted from the presynaptic to the postsynaptic cells. Thus, for example, blocking nicotinic acetylcholine receptors blocks both sympathetic (excitatory) and parasympathetic (calming) stimulation of the heart. The nicotinic antagonist hexamethonium, for example, does this by blocking the transmission of <b>outgoing</b> <b>signals</b> across the autonomic ganglia at the postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.|$|R
50|$|Since nicotinic receptors help {{transmit}} <b>outgoing</b> <b>signals</b> for {{the sympathetic}} and parasympathetic systems, nicotinic receptor antagonists such as hexamethonium {{interfere with the}} transmission of these signals. Thus, for example, nicotinic receptor antagonists interfere with the baroreflex that normally corrects changes in blood pressure by sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation of the heart.|$|R
50|$|Since the 1970s {{there has}} been an ongoing {{controversy}} among researchers as to whether bats use a form of processing known from radar termed coherent cross-correlation. Coherence means that the phase of the echolocation signals is used by the bats, while cross-correlation just implies that the <b>outgoing</b> <b>signal</b> is compared with the returning echoes in a running process. Today most - but not all - researchers believe that they use cross-correlation, but in an incoherent form, termed a filter bank receiver.|$|E

5000|$|Local {{telephone}} lines {{use the same}} wires to send and receive data, which results in {{a small amount of}} the <b>outgoing</b> <b>signal</b> being reflected back. This is useful for people talking on the phone, as it provides a signal to the speaker that their voice is making it through the system. However, this reflected signal causes problems for the modem, which is unable to distinguish between a signal from the remote modem and the echo of its own signal. This was why earlier modems split the signal frequencies into [...] "answer" [...] and [...] "originate"; the modem could then ignore any signals in the frequency range it was using for transmission. Even with improvements to the phone system allowing higher speeds, this splitting of available phone signal bandwidth still imposed a half-speed limit on modems.|$|E
5000|$|All {{species of}} {{catfishes}} can generate sound through stridulation, and many produce sounds through [...] [...] Stridulation {{consists of the}} clicking or grinding of bony parts on the fishâ€™s pectoral fins and pectoral girdle, and drumming consists of the contraction of specialized sonic muscles with subsequent reverberation through the swimbladder. [...] Variability in the sound signals created by the channel catfish depends on the mechanism by which the sound is produced, {{the function of the}} resultant sound, and physical factors such as sex, age, and temperature. [...] This variation may result in increased complexity of the <b>outgoing</b> <b>signal</b> and may allow for increased usefulness of the signal in interspecies communication.

This way, it would be enough to attach the proposed symbolic notations to events to improve the notions of multiplicity, interaction, and parallelism. However, an optional short arrow is suggested to emphasize outgoing (arrow entering the hole) and incoming (arrow leaving the hole) events as shown in Table 1. Hereafter, they will always be used in the pcb-statecharts.|$|R

40|$|Optomyography is {{the term}} chosen to name a device {{containing}} several reflective photosensors placed in an armband.

The aims of this research were to build such a device that is capable of expressing the structure changes in form of intensity changes in light emitting diodes and determine whether it is possible to distinguish different muscle movements. This was accomplished by designing and testing two different circuit schematics for Optomyography that differ depending on whether the <b>outgoing</b> <b>signal</b> is processed or not. The schematics were then used to build two electrical circuits of Optomyography that were tested with several subjects to see if they were functioning. The results show that only the version of Optomyography, which processes the <b>outgoing</b> <b>signal</b> with a high-pass filter and amplifies it, is able to detect muscle movements through skin structure variations.

50|$|The {{receiving}} station and control point now occupy a classic white 1920s' Art Deco building on Sir Francis Drake Boulevard in the Point Reyes National Seashore whereas the transmitter site is about 20 miles south at , {{near the town}} of Bolinas. The reason for siting the transmitters so far away from the receivers is that their powerful <b>outgoing</b> <b>signals</b> would make it difficult to hear weak incoming signals from faraway ships on the same frequency (or channel). Operators at the receiving site remotely control and key the transmitters by means of landlines connecting the two sites.|$|R
50|$|The {{control plane}} {{maintains}} {{information that can}} be used to change data used by the data plane. Maintaining this information requires handling complex signaling protocols. Implementing these protocols in the data plane would lead to poor forwarding performance. A common way to manage these protocols is to let the data plane detect incoming signaling packets and locally forward them to the control plane. The control plane signaling protocols can update the data plane information and inject <b>outgoing</b> <b>signaling</b> packets into the data plane. This architecture works because signaling traffic is a very small part of the global traffic.|$|R

50|$|A major {{expense of}} {{wire-line}} telephone service is the outside wire plant. Telephones transmit both the incoming and <b>outgoing</b> speech <b>signals</b> on {{a single pair of}} wires. A twisted pair line rejects electromagnetic interference (EMI) and crosstalk better than a single wire or an untwisted pair. The strong <b>outgoing</b> speech <b>signal</b> from the microphone (transmitter) does not overpower the weaker incoming speaker (receiver) signal with sidetone because a hybrid coil (A3) and other components compensate the imbalance. The junction box (B) arrests lightning (B2) and adjusts the line's resistance (B1) to maximize the signal power for the line length. Telephones have similar adjustments for inside line lengths (A8). The line voltages are negative compared to earth, to reduce galvanic corrosion. Negative voltage attracts positive metal ions toward the wires.|$|R
