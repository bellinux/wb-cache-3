Crossing historical and geographical boundaries in unprecedented ways and considering the role of <b>ornament</b> in both art and architecture, Histories of <b>Ornament</b> offers a nuanced examination that integrates medieval, Renaissance, baroque, and modern Euroamerican traditions with their Islamic, Indian, Chinese, and Mesoamerican counterparts.

Organized by thematic sections on the significance, influence, and role of <b>ornament,</b> the book addresses <b>ornament's</b> current revival in architecture, its historiography and theories, its transcontinental mobility in medieval and early modern Europe and the Middle East, and its place in the context of industrialization and modernism.

40|$|Owen Jones (1809 - 1874) was a Victorian architect, {{antiquarian}} and ornamentor of house-hold fame. He was Superintendant of the Works for the Royal Society of Arts sponsored Crystal Palace of 1851. He {{published his}} monumental chromolithographed The Grammar of <b>Ornament</b> in 1856, an encyclopediac compendium of nineteen styles of world <b>ornament</b> {{and a final}} twentieth chapter on nature. One of the great virtues of the Grammar is the theory of conventionalization of both <b>ornament</b> and color in the 37 propositions of the Preface. Taking this theory as a starting point, the book looks at Jones 2 ̆ 7 original <b>ornament</b> collected in the Victoria and Albert Museum and analyzes the strategies of the field, or the mathematical distribution of <b>ornament</b> over diapered surfaces as conditioned by borders. The book also asserts Jones primary contribution as an ornamentor and theorist of <b>ornament.</b> His <b>ornament</b> is conditioned further by the spiritual notions of repose as the aesthetic end of <b>ornament.</b> The sciences of botany, mathematics, physics, and psychology are allied and melded {{into one of the}} most profound achievements in the history of <b>ornament.</b> Jones 2 ̆ 7 original <b>ornament</b> as the art of architecture influences Art Nouveau, Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright in America, and Art Deco. Its implications reverberate in the creation of the Modern Movement which has purged the ancient tradition of <b>ornament</b> from its agenda and academic instruction.

6000|$|First. Mr. Garbett cannot {{get rid of}} his unfortunate {{notion that}} <b>ornament</b> is a thing to be {{manufactured}} separately, and fastened on. He supposes that an <b>ornament</b> may be called good in itself, in the stonemason's yard or in the ironmonger's shop: Once for all, let him put this idea out of his head. We may say of a thing, considered separately, {{that it is a}} pretty thing; but before we can say it is a good <b>ornament,</b> we must {{know what it is to}} adorn, and how. As, for instance, a ring of gold is a pretty thing; it is a good <b>ornament</b> on a woman's finger; not a good <b>ornament</b> hung through her under lip. A hollyhock, seven feet high, would be a good <b>ornament</b> for a cottage-garden; not a good <b>ornament</b> for a lady's head-dress. Might not Mr. Garbett have seen this without my showing? and that, therefore, when I said [...] "good" [...] <b>ornament,</b> I said [...] "well-placed" [...] <b>ornament,</b> in one word, and that, also, when Mr. Garbett says [...] "it may be overcharged by being misplaced," [...] he merely says it may be overcharged by being bad.|$|R
