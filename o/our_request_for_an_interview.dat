40|$|University SME Centre for {{producing}} this report {{in response to}} <b>our</b> <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> independent assessment {{of the economic and}} social contribution of SMEs in Northern Ireland. In particular {{we would like to thank}} Kirsty McManus, Director of the Centre for SME Development, for coordinating the report, Dr Robert Kerr and Ian Smyth of the Department of Management and Leadership for the survey report, and Dr Mark Bailey of the Department of Accounting, Finance and Economics, for the economic analysis. The research consists of two strands, an analysis of the economic value of the small business sector, and an analysis of the results of a survey which sought to identify the key challenges for SMEs. The results and findings of the research clearly demonstrate that collectively SMEs make the majority contribution to Northern Ireland. Small and medium-sized companies and self-employed people, together, provide; 75 % of employment, 75 % of turnover and 81 % of GVA in NI’s private sector. Furthermore, SMEs actually employ more people than NI’s large companies and the public sector combined 1. Socially too, SMEs play a major role. As demonstrated in this survey of 200 SMEs, small businesses make a substantial contribution to the socio-cultural fabric of their local area, by employing staff who were previously long-term unemployed, by engaging with schools, colleges and community groups, and by donating time, services and money to local charities...|$|R

40|$|We {{were delighted}} to be asked by Microbial Cell Factories to act as guest editors for the manuscripts in this issue {{associated}} with the LAB 10 Symposium. The LAB Sympo- sia have been very important benchmarks in the careers of many LAB researchers, charting {{the development of this}} field from the very beginnings of our understanding of the molecular biology and physiology of these hugely interest- ing organisms right through to the current sophisticated ‘omics’ era. While we have significantly improved our understanding of the basic physiology and the key roles of individual organisms and the contributions of individual molecular mechanisms to the many industrial applications of LAB, our recognition and investigation of the potential of these organisms in human health {{has been one of the}} most rewarding aspects of the last few decades. The nine meetings to date have served to bring the global LAB community together every three years to review progress and the plan for the future in a friendly, collaborative set- ting. It is not an exaggeration to suggest that the Symposia have been a key factor in the extraordinary world of LAB biology, one in which direct competition has peacefully co-existed with a genuine warmth and collaborative spirit. We expect and hope that the tenth meeting will continue this tradition of ‘coopetition’. The papers contained in this issue are linked to oral presentations at LAB 10 by some of the leaders and up- and-coming scientists in our field, and we hope that this collection of manuscripts will fulfil at least two roles. Firstly, they will give <b>an</b> opportunity <b>for</b> <b>a</b> wider audience to evaluate progress in the field, and secondly, they will prove invaluable in the future as a record of the state of the art at this point in our on-going engagement with these industrially important microorganisms. The manuscripts (both reviews and original papers) cover the main thematic areas of the meeting; Evolution, Systems Biology and Metabolic Engineering, Host Microbe Interaction, Nutrition and Health, Preservations and Stress, and fermentation and Application. We have sought to maintain the usual high standard applied to all MCF submissions for the papers in this issue, and so each paper was subjected to the usual peer review process. We thank the MCF Editor-in-Chief Antonio Villaverde and Helen Whitaker of BioMed Central for their support during the editorial process, the authors for their prompt response to <b>our</b> <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> rapid process and, most of all, the reviewers who gave their time and effort to review the manuscripts...|$|R
40|$|This project extends {{previously}} discovered Fe-based catalysts to hydrogen-poor {{synthesis gas}} streams derived from coal and biomass sources. These catalysts have shown unprecedented Fischer-Tropsch synthesis rate, selectivity for feedstocks consisting of synthesis gas derived from methane. During the first reporting period, we certified a microreactor, installed required analytical equipment, and reproduced synthetic protocols and catalytic results previously reported. During the second reporting period, we prepared several Fe-based compositions for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and tested {{the effects of}} product recycle under both subcritical and supercritical conditions. During {{the third and fourth}} reporting periods, we improved the catalysts preparation method, which led to Fe-based FT catalysts with the highest FTS reaction rates and selectivities so far reported, a finding that allowed their operation at lower temperatures and pressures with high selectivity to desired products (C{sub 5 +}, olefins). During this fifth reporting period, we have studied the effects of different promoters on catalytic performance, specifically how their sequence of addition dramatically influences the performance of these materials in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The resulting procedures have been optimized to improve further upon the already unprecedented rates and C{sub 5 +} selectivities of the Fe-based catalysts that we have developed as part of this project. During this fifth reporting period, we have also continued our studies of optimal activation procedures, involving reduction and carburization of oxide precursors during the early stages of contact with synthesis gas. We have completed the analysis of the evolution of oxide, carbide, and metal phases of the active iron components during initial contact with synthesis gas using advanced synchrotron techniques based on X-ray absorption spectroscopy. We have confirmed that the Cu or Ru compensates for inhibitory effects of Zn, a surface area promoter. The kinetic behavior of these materials, specifically the effects of H{sub 2 }, CO, and CO{sub 2 } on the rates and selectivities of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reactions has led to <b>a</b> new proposal <b>for</b> the nature of rate-determining steps on Fe and Co Fischer-Tropsch catalysts, and more specifically to the roles of hydrogen-assisted and alkali-assisted dissociation of CO in determining rates and CO{sub 2 } selectivities. Finally, we have started an exploratory study of the use of colloidal precipitation methods for the synthesis of small Fe and Co clusters using recently developed methods. During this period, we have had to restrict manpower assigned to this project because some irregularities in reporting and communications have led to the interruption of funding during this period. This has led to less than optimal productivity and to significant disruptions of the technical work. These issues have also led to significant underspending of project funds during this reporting period and to <b>our</b> consequent <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> no-cost extension of one year, which we understand has been granted...|$|R
