5|$|Astrid Kruse Jensen (born 1975, {{educated in}} the Netherlands and Scotland) specializes in {{photographs}} taken at night which evoke the zone between reality and imagination.

5|$|Although many non-sessile {{bivalves}} {{use their}} muscular foot to move around, or to dig, {{members of the}} freshwater family Sphaeriidae are exceptional in that these small clams climb about quite nimbly on weeds using their long and flexible foot. The European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum), for example, climbs around on water weeds at the edges <b>of</b> <b>lakes</b> and ponds; this enables the clam {{to find the best}} position for filter feeding.|$|E
5|$|Eolambia {{would have}} lived in a forested {{environment}} at the edge <b>of</b> <b>lakes</b> in a humid floodplain environment, feeding on gymnosperms, ferns, and flowering plants. The water levels in the lakes changed over time with cyclical wet and dry spells caused by the precession of the Earth, reflected by alternating bands in the sediments of the Mussentuchit Member. As a juvenile, Eolambia would have been preyed upon by large crocodylomorphs residing in the lake waters. With increasing age, however, they became impervious to the crocodylomorphs, and mature individuals (at least eight to nine years in age) were preyed on by large theropods such as the neovenatorid Siats.|$|E

5|$|Fur-bearing trout are fictional {{creatures that}} are purportedly found in Arkansas, {{northern}} North America, and Iceland. The basic claim (or tall tale) {{is that the}} waters <b>of</b> <b>lakes</b> and rivers {{in the area are}} so cold that they evolved a thick coat of fur to maintain their body heat. Another theory says that it is due to four jugs - or two bottles - of hair tonic being spilled into the Arkansas River.|$|E
5|$|Hunting {{with lead}} shot, {{along with the}} use of lead sinkers in angling, has been {{identified}} as a major cause of lead poisoning in waterfowl, which often feed off the bottom <b>of</b> <b>lakes</b> and wetlands where the shot collects. A Spanish study showed that northern pintail and common pochard were the species with the highest levels of lead shot ingestion, higher than in northern countries of the western Palearctic flyway, where lead shot has been banned. In the United States, Canada, and many western European countries, all shot used for waterfowl must now be non-toxic, and therefore may not contain any lead.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Theodore Wirth came to Minneapolis as {{the parks}} superintendent. During his tenure, {{the park system}} {{increased}} from 1810 acres (7.3km²) in 57 properties to 5421 acres (21.9km²) in 144 properties. The park system, organized around the Minneapolis chain <b>of</b> <b>lakes</b> (including Cedar Lake, Lake of the Isles, Lake Calhoun, Lake Harriet, Lake Hiawatha, and Lake Nokomis) became a model for park planners around the world. He also encouraged active recreation in the parks, {{as opposed to just}} setting aside parks for passive admiration.|$|E

5|$|In the Carnian {{stage of}} the Late Triassic (228.0 - 216.5 Mya), capitosauroids were joined by the superficially very similar Metoposauridae. Metoposaurids are {{distinguished}} from capitosauroids by the positioning of their eye sockets {{near the front of}} their skulls. Another group of stereospondyls, the plagiosaurs, had wide heads with external gills, and adapted to life at the bottom <b>of</b> <b>lakes</b> and rivers. By this time, temnospondyls had become a common and widespread component of semiaquatic ecosystems. Some temnospondyls, such as Cryobatrachus and Kryostega, even inhabited Antarctica, which was covered in temperate forests at the time.|$|E
5|$|Lake Calhoun, a lake of the Chain <b>of</b> <b>Lakes</b> in Minneapolis, {{was named}} after Calhoun by {{surveyors}} sent by Calhoun during his tenure as Secretary of War to map the area around Fort Snelling in 1817. On May 4, 2017, it was renamed Lake Bde Maka Ska {{by a vote of}} the Minneapolis Park Board, pending approval by the Minnesota Department Of Natural Resources and the U.S. Board Of Geographic Names. Bde Maka Ska in the Dakota language means White Banks Lake.|$|E
5|$|Near Tupper Lake, it skirts the {{boundary}} between Franklin and Saint Lawrence for a considerable distance before entering Tupper Lake and intersecting NY3. The two routes overlap to Harrietstown, where NY30 splits from NY3 and heads north along a series <b>of</b> <b>lakes,</b> including Upper Saranac Lake and Meacham Lake. North of Duane, NY30 exits Adirondack Park and heads north towards Malone. Within the village, NY30 briefly overlaps US11. The Adirondack Trail ends at {{the east end of}} the overlap. The route continues north out of the village to the Canada–US border in Constable, where it becomes Route138 upon entering Quebec at the Trout River Border Crossing.|$|E

5|$|The {{ecological}} succession concept, pioneered in the 1900s and 1910s by Henry Chandler Cowles and Frederic Clements, {{was important in}} early plant ecology. Alfred Lotka's predator-prey equations, G. Evelyn Hutchinson's studies of the biogeography and biogeochemical structure <b>of</b> <b>lakes</b> and rivers (limnology) and Charles Elton's studies of animal food chains were pioneers among the succession of quantitative methods that colonized the developing ecological specialties. Ecology became an independent discipline in the 1940s and 1950s after Eugene P. Odum synthesized many of the concepts of ecosystem ecology, placing relationships between groups of organisms (especially material and energy relationships) {{at the center of}} the field.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>lakes</b> in the {{watershed}} of Muncy Creek, including Eagles Mere Lake, Highland Lake, and Beaver Lake. The creek was known as Occohpocheny to Native Americans. The area in its vicinity was settled in 1783. Various other industries and mills were constructed in the creek's vicinity from the late 18th century to the early 20th century. Wild trout naturally reproduce in part of Muncy Creek. Part of the creek is navigable by canoe.|$|E
5|$|A {{large amount}} <b>of</b> <b>lakes</b> and rivers {{are found in}} the Eurasian Economic Union. Major lakes include Ladoga and Onega, two of the largest lakes in Europe. The largest and most {{prominent}} of the union's bodies of fresh water is Lake Baikal, the world's deepest, purest, oldest and most capacious fresh water lake. The Baikal lake alone contains over one-fifth of the world's fresh surface water. Russia is second only to Brazil in volume of the total renewable water resources. Of the union's numerous rivers, the Volga is the most famous, not only because it is the longest in Europe, but also because of its major role in history. In Siberia the Ob, Yenisey, Lena and Amur are among the longest rivers in the world.|$|E
