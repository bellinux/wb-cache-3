Their envoys also started discussions with Sigismund Báthory about the compensation for their expropriated Transylvanian estates.|$|E

5|$|During a later press investigation, Oosthuizen {{claimed to}} have acted independently. Anton Rupert, the head of Rembrandt, {{endorsed}} this version, asserting that Oosthuizen had acted {{in his capacity as}} an employee of the SASF. Rupert said this was an autonomous organisation, but according to Oborne the SASF constitution made it totally dependent on Rembrandt. Oborne writes that Oosthuizen's offers were rooted in the plans made by Vorster and Coy to bribe D'Oliveira indirectly by <b>offering</b> <b>him</b> work that would prevent him from playing for the MCC. Oborne surmises that the position and salary offered to D'Oliveira did not come from the SASF, but were actually part of a scheme involving Vorster and Rupert to remove the controversial player from the tour. Williams also concludes that the offer was effectively a bribe to stop D'Oliveira playing.|$|E
