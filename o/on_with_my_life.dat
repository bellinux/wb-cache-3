500|$|On January 25, 1994, the Chandlers' {{lawsuit was}} {{settled out of}} court with $15,331,250 to be held in a trust fund for Jordan, $1.5 million for each of his parents and the family's lawyer slated to receive $5 million for a total of {{approximately}} $23 million (although another source showed Feldman was to receive $3 million based on a September 1993 retainer, for a total of $21 million). According to a motion passed to Judge Melville in 2004, leading up to the 2005 trial, Evan Chandler himself is the one who initiated the settlement with Jackson's insurer. [...] Jackson's insurance company [...] "negotiated and paid the settlement, over the protests of Mr. Jackson and his personal legal counsel" [...] and was [...] "the source of the settlement amounts"; as noted in a 2005 memorandum in People v. Jackson. It also noted [...] "an insurance carrier has the right to settle claims covered by insurance where it decides settlement is expedient and the insured may not interfere with nor prevent such settlements", as established by a number of precedents in California. Defeating the right would involve convincing a court with the power to overrule the precedent that the earlier decision was either wrongly decided or more often, 'clearly' wrong (depending on the criteria of the court) or the court must be convinced to distinguish the case. That is, to make the ruling narrower than that in the precedent due to some difference in facts between the current and precedent case, while still supporting the result reached in the earlier case. In 2004, Jackson's attorney Thomas Mesereau in People v. Jackson said [...] "People who intended to earn millions of dollars from his record and music promotions did not want negative publicity from these lawsuits interfering with their profits. Michael Jackson now regrets making these payments. These settlements were entered into with one primary condition – that condition was that Mr. Jackson never admitted any wrongdoing. Mr. Jackson always denied doing anything wrong...Mr. Jackson now realizes the advice he received was wrong." [...] Jackson explained why had he tried to settle: [...] "I wanted to go <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> Too many people had already been hurt. I want to make records. I want to sing. I want to perform again...It's my talent. My hard work. My life. My decision." [...] He also wanted to avoid a [...] "media circus".|$|E

Therefore, I say, Luke, that you have no longer any right to keep me at arm's length. You have no right, having once come into <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> having once given substance and vitality to my love, to withdraw yourself away from me. Love, dear, is a bond, a mutual bond, as sacred, as binding as any that are contracted on this earth. You--when you wrote that letter, when first you spoke to me of love--entered into a bond with me.

40|$|Catalogue of a Loss is a {{collection}} of sixty-two prose poems written within the past year and half. The work is printed on 4 x 6 cards. Each poem may be read individually from a single card or the poems can be read in sequences. Each poem maps to at least one prescribed sequence that is visually indicated on the card(s). In the case that the poem maps to multiple sequences that poem is reprinted so that each subset it belongs to may be individually represented. Within this document, I've provided re-printings of the cards along with four of the larger possible sequences I have framed for the reader (indicated by red / violet / cyan/ gold). There are no duplicates within this set therefore the described cross-referencing in which a single poem maps to multiple sequences is not represented. The reader is encouraged to make what he will of the sequences: my intention is that the relationships suggested by the proposed reading-sequences do not establish a single structure designed to constrain the reader but offer, instead, multiple structures that will inspire new relationships of the reader's own making. The work is a memoir-of-sorts. I began working on this piece in January 2011 knowing that I would write about my father who died in January 2007 -ten years after he first began experiencing symptoms of dementia. In that time I took off the Fall semester and lived in San Francisco. Writing this work caused <b>my</b> own re-examination <b>on</b> <b>life</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> parents, <b>life</b> at MIT and life out in the world. The work examines <b>my</b> <b>life</b> at an intimate distance. Even the colors that I used to encode the poems are taken from our family portrait. The card-form emulates exactly how I was remembering my past: connections were formed and then blurred; random details were vivid and unforgettable while others completely disappeared. The resulting work explores the lines between art and life, between art-making and life-making, between past and present, between solitude and loneliness, between intellectual exile and the comforts of home, between "family" self and "independent" self.
