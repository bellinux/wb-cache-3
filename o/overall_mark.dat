25|$|Theo Bellmont hired Eugene Van Gent from Missouri in 1916 to {{lead the}} Texas football, {{basketball}}, and track programs. Van Gent's single basketball team at Texas recorded a 13–3 <b>overall</b> <b>mark</b> and won the Southwest Conference championship {{for the third consecutive}} year, with the season highlighted by the first-ever basketball games between Texas and the Texas A Aggies, following the resumption of athletic relations between the two schools. The Longhorns began the basketball rivalry with wins in both home games and in one of two games in College Station. Van Gent's 1917 Texas team also added the final four wins to the Texas winning streak that had begun in 1913 before suffering a 24–18 loss to Rice in Austin. Texas' winning streak stood as the NCAA record for consecutive wins in men's basketball for almost 40 years (until Phil Woolpert's Bill Russell-led San Francisco teams won 60 consecutive games from 1955 to 1957), and the achievement today remains the fifth-longest winning streak in Division I history. Van Gent departed after coaching for one season in each sport—winning the conference championship in both—to join the military following the United States' entry into the First World War in April 1917.|$|E

[...] He gave the episode an <b>overall</b> <b>mark</b> of C+. James Hunt reviewed the episode for the website [...] "Den of Geek" [...] in November 2012, and said that it was the best episode of the series up until that point.

The second game the following night proceeded more in line with expectations, with Kansas winning handily, 49–35. Following the series against KU, Texas traveled to Oklahoma City to compete {{for the first time in}} the All-College Tournament, which had begun in 1937. The 1939 edition of the holiday tournament featured 32 teams from the Southwest and Midwest. The Longhorns easily advanced through their tournament bracket, defeating Southeastern State College (Oklahoma), Westminster College (Missouri), Kansas State Teachers College, and tournament favorite Baylor before falling to Central Missouri State Teachers College in the championship game, 33–25. Texas began conference play with an upset loss to the Rice Owls before hosting the Arkansas Razorbacks for two games in Austin. The Longhorns won a close first contest, 41–37, before being thoroughly outclassed in the second, falling 65–41. With Texas reeling—having started 1–2 in SWC play, and hosting no conference games in Austin for the next month—the team's goal of ending the conference championship drought was in peril.

UWA also ended several streaks picking up wins at Lambuth, against Southern Arkansas, and at Arkansas-Monticello.

At the time, UNA was ranked #1 in all the Division II polls. [...] Through a fearless and courageous effort, UWA sent the game to overtime after losing the lead they held throughout the game. [...] After four overtimes, it appeared UNA was set to claim the victory until a forced fumble gave UWA the ball. [...] From that, they took advantage and kicked the game-winning field goal. [...] It was the first win for the Tigers at Braly Municipal Stadium in Florence since the 1987 season. The NCAA rewarded UWA's efforts with a berth in the NCAA Division II playoffs. [...] In the first round, the Tigers upset #20 Albany State 24-22 on the road. After falling behind early against #10 Carson-Newman, the Tigers mounted a rally before falling short 59-41. The Tigers gathered an 8-5 record, the most wins since 1975, and had eight All-GSC honors.
