[...] "We did a few takes where I would just do this scream and sort of puke Hershey's chocolate syrup. Scratch the Hershey's because I don't want to endorse that or anything", she stated. [...] "And then, special effects did a rig that clamps onto my ear and you revisit it in the pool scene..." [...] Fox said it [...] "clips on. It goes {{around the back of}} my ear and then I bite down on it on the side <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> like this, and it projectiles. It's a tube..." ...|$|E
500|$|News of Barrymore's {{success in}} Hamlet piqued the {{interest}} of Warner Bros., which signed him as {{the lead in the}} 1924 film Beau Brummel. Unhappy in his marriage, Barrymore– aged 40 at the time– sought solace elsewhere and had an affair with his 17-year-old co-star Mary Astor during filming. Although the film was not an unqualified success, the cast, including Barrymore, was generally praised. Around this time, Barrymore acquired the nickname [...] "the Great Profile", as posters and photographs of him tended to favor the left-hand side. He later said: [...] "The right side <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> looks like a fried egg. The left side has features that {{are to be found in}} almost any normal anthropological specimen, and those are the apples I try to keep on top of the barrel." ...|$|E
500|$|Etan Cohen {{created the}} role of Kirk Lazarus {{as a way of}} lampooning the great lengths that some method actors go to depict a role. Downey was {{approached}} by Stiller about the part while on vacation in Hawaii. Downey said on CBS' The Early Show that his first reaction was, [...] "This is the stupidest idea I've ever heard!" [...] and that Stiller responded, [...] "Yeah, I know— isn't it great?" [...] In another interview, Downey said that he accepted the part but, having no idea where or even how to start building the character of Lazarus, eventually settled on a jive-esque speech pattern and a ragged bass voice; he then auditioned Lazarus' voice over the phone to Stiller, who approved the characterization immediately. Downey revealed that he modeled the character on actors Russell Crowe, Colin Farrell, and Daniel Day-Lewis. The initial script was written for Downey's character to be Irish, but was altered after Downey stated he could improvise better as an Australian (he had previously played a similar outlandish Australian character in the film Natural Born Killers). Downey's practice of remaining in character between takes and even off the film set was also written into the script for his character to perform. Downey required between one and a half to twohours of make-up application. According to Downey, [...] "One makeup artist would start on one side <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> and a second makeup artist would start on the other side, and then they'd meet in the middle." ...|$|E

50|$|Again today, I {{stand in}} the {{drainage}} pipe which almost killed me.

He was right in front <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> and, in essence, calling me a slut by asking questions like 'When's {{the last time you}} had sex with your boyfriend?'" [...] Wise's lawyer had also asked her whether she had been assaulted by men in her life, suggested that a man she knew may have attacked her, and implied her injuries were not as severe as they had been made out to be.|$|E

60|$|He {{began to}} laugh again, but the sight <b>of</b> <b>my</b> grave <b>face</b> checked him. He at once assumed the {{appearance}} of a penitent.|$|R

60|$|When I {{came home}} here at midnight I found another letter from you (I left off {{in this place}} to press it dutifully to my lips).

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with The Root she discussed the upcoming book: “Despite {{the fact that the}} most visible woman in the United States is black, popular culture still hasn't moved past the only adjective apparently meant to describe us: 'strong'. 'Bitch' will hopefully function as a sort of dictionary (abridged, of course), providing a new vocabulary for black women. Almost automatically I'd describe myself as strong, but I'm also flawed, tired, sexy, depressed, frightened, naïve, hilarious, greedy and, of course, bitchy. In 16 essays, 'Bitch' gives credence to each one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>faces</b> - the secret sides every woman often keeps hidden.” ...|$|R
60|$|I {{know not}} what impulse made me draw back so suddenly. The action {{was as much}} the child of {{instinct}} as of the lately acquired habit <b>of</b> concealing <b>my</b> <b>face</b> from the gaze of all who were likely to spread abroad the news that I still lived.|$|R

60|$|An answer {{had arrived}} to Holmes's {{telegram}} before our Surrey officer had returned. Holmes {{read it and}} was about to place it in his notebook when he caught a glimpse <b>of</b> <b>my</b> expectant <b>face.</b> He tossed it across with a laugh.|$|R
60|$|Her manner was defiant, {{her tone}} was positive; I doubted both.
