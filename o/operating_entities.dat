5000|$|In {{a typical}} income trust structure, the income paid to an income trust by the <b>operating</b> <b>entity</b> {{may take the}} form of interest, royalty or lease payments, which are {{normally}} deductible in computing the <b>operating</b> <b>entity’s</b> income for tax purposes. These deductions can reduce the <b>operating</b> <b>entity’s</b> tax to nil. The trust in turn, [...] "flows" [...] all of its income received from the <b>operating</b> <b>entity</b> out to unitholders. The distributions paid or payable to unitholders reduces a trust's taxable income, so the net result is that a trust would also pay little to no income tax.

50|$|Averaging these {{rates of}} returns, as a {{percentage}} of the total asset base, produces a WARA. In theory, the WARA should generate the same cost of capital as the Weighted average cost of capital, or WACC. The theory holds true because the <b>operating</b> <b>entity</b> is considered fundamentally equivalent to the combined assets of the company. Therefore, the measure of risks across each are equivalent. In the case of the <b>operating</b> <b>entity,</b> risk is measured against the WACC, while in the case of the combined assets, risk is measured by the WARA. Reconciliations between the two are typically required as a component of a Purchase price allocation in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB") Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 “Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141”).|$|R
