5|$|The {{biochemical}} {{basis for}} the toxicity <b>of</b> <b>oxygen</b> is the partial reduction <b>of</b> <b>oxygen</b> by one or two electrons to form reactive oxygen species, which are natural by-products of the normal metabolism <b>of</b> <b>oxygen</b> and have important roles in cell signalling.

Oxygen is necessary for cell metabolism, and the blood supplies it to {{all parts of the}} body. When oxygen is breathed at high partial pressures, a hyperoxic condition will rapidly spread, with the most vascularised tissues being most vulnerable. During times of environmental stress, levels of reactive oxygen species can increase dramatically, which can damage cell structures and produce oxidative stress.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} molecular mechanism <b>of</b> reactive <b>oxygen</b> species production by flavin dehydrogenases mitochondrial glycerol- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (mGPDH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH).

Relevant knowledge is therefore summarized {{in the first part}} of the thesis.

40|$|A redox cycle process, {{in which}} CH 4 and air are {{periodically}} brought {{into contact with}} a solid oxide packed in a fixed-bed reactor, combined with the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction, is proposed for hydrogen production. The sole oxidant for partial oxidation of methane (POM) {{is found to be}} lattice <b>oxygen</b> instead <b>of</b> gaseous <b>oxygen.</b> A perovskite-type LaFeO 3 oxide was prepared by a sol-gel method and employed as an oxygen storage material in this process. The results indicate that, under appropriate reaction conditions, methane can be oxidized to CO and H- 2 by the lattice <b>oxygen</b> <b>of</b> LaFeO 3 perovskite oxide with a selectivity higher than 95 % and the consumed lattice oxygen can be replenished in a reoxidation procedure by a redox operation. It is suggested that the POM to H- 2 /CO by using the lattice <b>oxygen</b> <b>of</b> the <b>oxygen</b> storage materials instead <b>of</b> gaseous <b>oxygen</b> should be possibly applicable. The LaFeO 3 perovskite oxide maintained relatively high catalytic activity and structural stability, while the carbonaceous deposits, which come from the dissociation of CH 4 in the pulse reaction, occurred due to the low migration rate <b>of</b> lattice <b>oxygen</b> from the bulk toward the surface. A new dissociation-oxidation mechanism for this POM without gaseous oxygen is proposed based on the transient responses of the products checked at different surface states via both pulse reaction and switch reaction over the LaFeO 3 catalyst. In the absence <b>of</b> gaseous-phase <b>oxygen,</b> the rate-determining step of methane conversion is the migration rate <b>of</b> lattice <b>oxygen,</b> but the process can be carried out in optimized cycles. The product distribution for POM over LaFeO 3 catalyst in the absence <b>of</b> gaseous <b>oxygen</b> was determined by the concentration <b>of</b> surface <b>oxygen,</b> which is relevant with the migration rate <b>of</b> lattice <b>oxygen</b> from the bulk toward the surface. This process of hydrogen production via selective oxidation of methane by lattice oxygen is better in avoiding the deep oxidation (to CO 2) and enhancing the selectivity.
