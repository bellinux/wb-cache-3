5|$|During {{the filming}} and {{promotion}} of Daft Punk's Electroma, the duo {{went to great lengths}} to avoid showing their faces. While on the set of the film, the duo chose to be interviewed with their backs turned. As reported on October 2006, the band went as far as to wear black cloth <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> during a televised interview. During this interview they noted that the use of cloth bags in particular had been a spontaneous decision, reflecting their willingness to experiment with their perceived image in the media.|$|E
5|$|The New York {{stage was}} filled with ribald humor and sexually {{offensive}} comedy; when movie producers started to put wisecracks in their sound pictures, they sought New York performers. Popular comics such as the Marx Brothers got their start on Broadway in front of live audiences. Censors complained {{when they had to}} keep up with the deluge of jokes in pictures in the early 1930s, some of which were designed to go <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads.</b> The comic banter of some early sound films was rapid-fire, non-stop, and frequently exhausting for the audience by the final reel.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Soult led a small force, some 150 musket-men, {{across the river}} Linth—the men held their muskets <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> and waded across, through water to their chests—and {{protected}} the crossing site {{for the remainder of}} the force. Baron von Hotze, commander of the Austrian force there, advanced on the position near Richterswil to direct its defense, and was killed by a French musket ball. His successor, Franz Petrasch, could not push the French back, and organized a retreat from the region, falling back to St. Gallen and losing another 8,000 men and some guns. By the time Suvorov arrived in St. Gallen in early October, the Austrians and the Russians had been pushed out and he was forced to lead his men over the Alps to the Vorarlberg, resulting in additional losses.|$|E
5|$|The event {{began with}} a match between The British Bulldogs (Davey Boy Smith and Dynamite Kid) and The Fabulous Rougeaus (Jacques and Raymond Rougeau). As soon as the bell rang to signify that the match had begun, Smith {{attacked}} Jacques. The two teams traded blows until The Rougeaus flipped Dynamite Kid <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> so that he fell on {{his back to the}} mat. Dynamite Kid escaped another offensive maneuver before tagging in his partner, Smith, and The British Bulldogs performed a double-team maneuver on Jacques. Despite having the upper hand, The Bulldogs failed to pin Jacques in time, and the match ended in a twenty-minute time draw.|$|E
5|$|Dustin Rhodes fought Bobby Roode, who was {{accompanied}} by Coach D'Amore and A-1, in what was billed as a Prince of Darkness match next. The duration of the bout was 15 minutes and 20 seconds. In this contest, there would be three falls, but the third fall would be contested under blindfold match rules, in which both wrestlers wore hoods <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads.</b> Roode earned the first fall with a roll-up pin, and Dustin earned the second one when he forced Roode face-first into the mat from the top rope. During the third fall, both wrestlers wore black hoods that impaired their vision, causing Dustin to accidentally knock the referee unconscious in storyline terms. Due to this, D'Amore opened the cage door and passed Roode a steel folding chair. Roode then attempted to bash Dustin with it but instead mistakenly struck D'Amore. Dustin then grabbed the chair and struck Roode with it, which gave him the pinfall as the referee came to.|$|E

5|$|Prior to impact, {{passengers}} did {{not assume}} the brace position. When the airplane came to rest, {{many of the}} passengers in the forward portion of the cabin were upside down, others, who were upright were submerged in water <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads.</b> Some passengers tried to move from their seats while their seatbelts were still buckled, and other passengers had difficulty locating and releasing their seatbelt buckles because of disorientation. Following the accident, passengers reported fires in the forward left and aft portions of the airplane, including many small fires on the water. Passengers stated that they escaped through large holes in the cabin. The lead flight attendant and first officer escaped {{through a hole in}} the cabin floor near the flight attendant’s position. Several passengers reported assisting others out of the cabin and into the knee-deep water. Many of them walked in the water to the dike, climbed up the wall and over an embankment, and slid down a steep hill to the runway. Others were assisted out of the water by ground personnel.|$|E
5|$|The {{very first}} Commando raid– Operation Collar on 23 June 1940– was not {{actually}} carried out by a Commando unit, but by one of their predecessors: No.11 Independent Company. The mission, led by Major Ronnie Tod, was an offensive reconnaissance carried out on the French coast south of Boulogne-sur-Mer and Le Touquet. The operation was a limited success; at least two German soldiers were killed whilst the only British injury was a flesh wound suffered by Lieutenant Colonel Dudley Clarke, who had accompanied the raiders as an observer. A second and similarly inconsequential raid, Operation Ambassador, was made on the German occupied island of Guernsey {{on the night of}} 14 July 1940 by men from H Troop of No. 3 Commando and No. 11 Independent Company. One unit landed on the wrong island and another group disembarked from its launch into water so deep that it came <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads.</b> Intelligence had indicated that there was a large German barracks on the island but the Commandos found only empty buildings. When they returned to the beach heavy seas had forced their launch offshore, and they were forced to swim out to sea to be picked up.|$|E
25|$|On November 12, 1966, {{five men}} who were digging a grave at a {{cemetery}} near Clendenin, West Virginia, claimed to see a man-like figure fly low from the trees <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads.</b> This is often identified as the first known sighting of {{what became known as}} the Mothman.|$|E

5000|$|The Kazu is a {{traditional}} ceremony performed by the winning candidate after elections to the JCR Executive Committee, following the announcement of results by the JCR Chair. A Kazu is a celebratory action which requires the winning candidate of every election to kick a full can of Coca-Cola down the stairs in the foyer, throw it <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>head</b> three times and then opening the can <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>head.</b> The JCR Standing Orders and website note that it [...] "may be done wearing clothes" [...] and that [...] "Wikipedia knows more about Kazus than anyone in College". The tradition is thought to stem from a Japanese exchange student visiting Durham from Teikyo University who regularly completed the act in the 1996/1997 academic year.|$|R
50|$|Technical ring jugglers {{concentrate}} on {{five to seven}} rings. They focus primarily on performance tricks such as pirouettes, juggling above the head and backcrosses.

The group returned there to play the last gig of a British tour on 10 November 1964, where four fans managed to sneak backstage and tip flour <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads.</b> Jimi Hendrix played twice at the hall during 1967.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Burgomaster (Mayor) Heinrich Denicke offered {{safe passage}} {{out of town}} to the Freikorps if they would disarm. Berthold refused it. Past noon, when the workers had gathered, a machine gun fired <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> to clear an exit passage out of the school. Instead of fleeing, the union men shot back. In the ensuing firefight, 13 workers and three Freikorps combatants were killed. An {{additional}} eight Freikorps fighters were summarily executed after capture by the laborers. The school grounds were encircled. The Freikorps was besieged.|$|E

50|$|Backward throw - This is {{when the}} {{competitor}} throws the welly <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>head,</b> whilst facing away from their target.

25|$|The staff sling, {{also known}} as the stave sling, fustibalus (Latin), fustibale (French), {{consists}} of a staff (a length of wood) with a short sling at one end. One cord of the sling is firmly attached to the stave and the other end has a loop that can slide off and release the projectile. Staff slings are extremely powerful because the stave can be made as long as two meters, creating a powerful lever. Ancient art shows slingers holding staff slings by one end, with the pocket behind them, and using both hands to throw the staves forward <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|E

25|$|Muslim women {{generally}} {{wear the}} tudung (hijab or headscarf) <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads.</b> However, Malay women not wearing any headgear are not reprimanded or penalised. Prominent Malaysian female examples are Datuk Seri Rafidah Aziz, International Trade and Industry Minister and Tun Dr Siti Hasmah Mohd Ali, wife of former Malaysian Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir bin Mohammad. However, with {{the influx of}} Arabic travellers, foreign Muslim women (Arabs) wearing hijab that leave only their eyes exposed are often spotted in tourist attractions, not the least at the shopping malls. At certain Malaysian {{institutions such as the}} International Islamic University, wearing of the tudung is mandatory; however for non-Muslim students this usually amounts to a loosely worn piece of cloth draped {{over the back of the}} head.|$|E

25|$|According to one account, Ion Antonescu {{was briefly}} a classmate of Wilhelm Filderman, the future Romanian Jewish {{community}} activist whose interventions with Conducător Antonescu helped save {{a number of}} his coreligionists. After graduation, in 1904, Antonescu joined the Romanian Army with the rank of Second Lieutenant. He spent the following two years attending courses at the Special Cavalry Section in Târgoviște. Reportedly, Antonescu was a zealous and goal-setting student, upset by the slow pace of promotions, and compensated for his diminutive stature through toughness. In time, the reputation of being a tough and ruthless commander, together with his reddish hair, earned him the nickname Câinele Roșu ("The Red Dog"). Antonescu also developed a reputation for questioning his commanders and for appealing <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> whenever he felt they were wrong.|$|E
25|$|Several bodies {{unearthed}} at Gacy's property {{were found}} with plastic bags <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> or upper torsos. In addition, {{several of the}} bodies were found with the ligature used to strangle them still knotted around their necks. In other instances, cloth gags were found lodged deep down the victims' throats, leading the investigators to conclude that 12 victims buried beneath Gacy's property died not of strangulation, but of asphyxiation. In some cases, bodies were found with foreign objects such as prescription bottles lodged into their pelvic region, the position of which indicated the items had been thrust into the victims' anus. All the victims discovered at 8213 Summerdale were in an advanced state of decomposition, and the medical examiner chiefly relied upon dental records to facilitate {{the identification of the}} remains.|$|E
25|$|To the north, {{resistance}} in and immediately around the drop zone was minor and sporadic, amounting {{to a few}} small groups of North Koreans and a meager amount of fire from mortars located somewhere to the north. Overcrowding caused by the 1st Battalion's misdirected drop complicated the 3d Battalion's assembly, but units managed to sort themselves out and secure {{the borders of the}} drop zone. An unexpected annoyance was created by civilians who appeared in the drop zone and began carrying away parachutes. Shots fired <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> ended the attempted theft. Against moderate but scattered opposition the 2d Battalion proceeded to occupy heights northeast of the drop zone, and under the command of its executive officer the 1st Battalion, less Company B, moved into the ground to the north and northwest, clearing Munsan-ni itself in the process.|$|E
