5|$|By the 1980s, Suharto's grip {{on power}} was {{maintained}} by the emasculation <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> <b>society,</b> engineered elections, {{and use of the}} military's coercive powers. Upon his retirement from the military in June 1976, Suharto undertook a re-organisation of the armed forces that concentrated power away from commanders to the president. In March 1983, he appointed General Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani as head of the armed forces who adopted a hardline on elements who challenged the administration. As a Roman Catholic, he was not a political threat to Suharto.|$|E
5|$|The Modi {{government}} {{launched a}} crackdown against a number <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> organisations. Several {{tens of thousands}} of organisations were investigated by the Intelligence Bureau {{in the first year of}} the administration, on the grounds that they were slowing economic growth. International humanitarian aid organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres was among the groups that were put under pressure. Other organisations affected included the Sierra Club and Avaaz. Cases of sedition were filed against individuals criticising the government. This led to discontent within the BJP regarding Modi's style of functioning and drew comparisons to the governing style of Indira Gandhi.|$|E
5|$|Initially, in the KOR's tradition, Solidarity was an ostensibly non-political {{movement}} {{aiming at}} reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> <b>society.</b> Suddenly thrust into legal existence and prominence in 1980, Solidarity and the Polish opposition in general lacked a constructive program or consensus regarding further developments. In 1981, Solidarity accepted {{the necessity of}} a political role and helped form a broad anti-ruling system social movement, dominated by the working class and with members ranging from people associated with the Catholic Church to non-communist leftists. The union was backed by intellectual dissidents, including the KOR, and adhered to a policy of nonviolent resistance. According to Karol Modzelewski, the Solidarity of 1980–81 was permeated by the idea of brotherhood between intelligentsia and workers. In the areas of ideology and politics, Solidarity followed the lead of its associated opposition intellectuals.|$|E

25|$|Unger's {{critique}} of and alternative to social programs {{goes to the}} heart <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> <b>society.</b> The problem we are faced with now, he claims, {{is that we have a}} bureaucratic system of distribution that provides lower quality service and prohibits the involvement <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> in the provision of public services. The alternative he lays out is to have the state act to equip civil society to partake in public services and care.

25|$|The {{proliferation}} <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> organizations flourished {{even more}} in the 1990s, {{due in part to}} King Hassan II’s active support for them, which reflected a worldwide trend <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> promotion. Some have argued that the king’s support was motivated as much by international pressures and his desire to join the European Union as domestic economic and political problems. It was in this environment that calls for reform to the Mudawana first began to gain traction.

40|$|The article {{provides}} a {{critical analysis of}} the role and function <b>of</b> global <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> within deliberative approaches to global governance. It critiques a common view that global <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> can/should act as an agent for democratising global governance and seeks to explore the importance <b>of</b> global <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> as an arena of deliberation. This more reconstructive aim is supplemented by an empirically focused discussion of the affective dimensions <b>of</b> global <b>civil</b> <b>society,</b> in general, and the increasingly important use of film, in particular. Ultimately, this then yields {{an image of the}} deliberative politics <b>of</b> global <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> that is more reflective of the differences, ambiguities and contests that pervade its discourses about global governance. This is presented as a quality that debates about deliberative global governance might learn from as well as speak to...|$|R
