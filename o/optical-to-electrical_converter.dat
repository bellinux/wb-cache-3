30|$|The {{apparatus}} {{necessary to}} measure the absolute P_de cannot fit in the cooling chamber; consequently, we measure P_de relative to a reference by sending diverging weak coherent pulses (WCPs) {{from the end of}} a fiber onto the APDs. Each APD’s active area is sufficiently small that it receives approximately uniformly distributed light intensity, despite the overall Gaussian profile of the incident optical mode. We use a 780  nm laser LD 3 (PicoQuant LDH 8 - 1) as the WCP source, pulsed at 40  MHz with full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 188  ps. The laser pulses are split by a 50 : 50 fiber beamsplitter (Thorlabs FC 780 - 50 B-FC). One output port is connected to a digital variable attenuator (OZ Optics DA- 100 - 35 - 770 / 830 / 850 - 5 / 125 - 5 - 40 -LL) and sends the laser pulses through a fiber to the APDs placed inside the cooling chamber. The other output port is connected to an <b>optical-to-electrical</b> <b>converter</b> (LeCroy OE 455, DC- 3.5  GHz) and the oscilloscope. Having oscilloscope access to both input laser pulses and output avalanche pulses allows us to measure Δ t_jitter (which requires using a pulsed laser, as opposed to continuous-wave such as LD 1).|$|E
40|$|Direct space-to-time (DST) pulse shaping, {{with its}} {{straightforward}} mapping of an input spatial pattern to an output temporal pattern, {{has been shown}} to be an effective method to create ultrafast optical data packets. To our knowledge, we introduce the first DST pulse shaper operating in the 1. 5 μm lightwave communications band, which is compatible with high-speed (≥ 100 Gb/s) optical communication systems. Novel features of our pulse shaper include polarization-independent operation, utilization of diffractive optical elements for spatial pattern generation, and a telescopic, fiber-coupled configuration. These features collectively enable the creation of equal intensity optical pulse sequences over a time aperture in excess of 100 ps and at rates of ∼ 100 GHz. These pulse sequences enable us to overcome electrical limitations and generate arbitrary electromagnetic waveforms in the GHz to multiple tens of GHz range through a novel optical technique. ^ Although creation of arbitrary optical waveforms is achievable through established methods—such as Fourier transform pulse shaping—arbitrary waveform generation capabilities in the microwave and millimeter-wave range are quite limited. We demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, cycle-by-cycle generation of broadband burst and continuous electromagnetic waveforms at center frequencies from ∼ 2 – 50 GHz. Our simple, reconfigurable method uses tailored optical pulse sequences from our 1. 5 μm DST pulse shaper to drive a high-speed <b>optical-to-electrical</b> <b>converter.</b> By appropriately tailoring the input optical spatial pattern of the pulse shaper, arbitrarily phase- and frequency-modulated electromagnetic waveforms are achieved. ...|$|E

40|$|Many mines rely on {{toxic gas}} sensors to help {{maintain}} a safe and healthy work environment. This report describes a prototype monitoring system developed by the U. S. Bureau of Mines (USBM) that uses light to power and communicate with several remote toxic gas sensors. The design is based on state-of-the-art <b>optical-to-electrical</b> power <b>converters,</b> solid-state diode lasers, and fiber optics. This design overcomes several problems associated with conventional wire-based systems by providing complete electrical isolation between the remote sensors and the central monitor.
