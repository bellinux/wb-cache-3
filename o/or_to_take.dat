5|$|During the {{communist}} era, rapid urbanization {{and growth of}} heavy industry occurred. Whole villages in the coal mining areas were destroyed by the mining activity. These conditions quickened the assimilation of the Poles. Another cause of assimilation was {{the high rate of}} intermarriage. Besides Poles belonging to the minority, many more commuted across the border from Polish People's Republic to work in Czechoslovakia <b>or</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of the relative abundance of consumer goods in Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{widespread}} assumption that plug-in recharging {{will take place}} overnight at home, residents of cities, apartments, dormitories, and townhouses do not have garages or driveways with available power outlets, and they might {{be less likely to}} buy plug-in electric vehicles unless recharging infrastructure is developed. Electrical outlets or charging stations near their places of residence, in commercial or public parking lots, streets and workplaces are required for these potential users to gain the full advantage of PHEVs, {{and in the case of}} EVs, to avoid the fear of the batteries running out energy before reaching their destination, commonly called range anxiety. Even house dwellers might need to charge at the office <b>or</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of opportunity charging at shopping centers. However, this infrastructure is not in place and it will require investments by both the private and public sectors.|$|E
5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} the Blades of Chaos, {{a pair of}} blades {{attached}} to chains that are wrapped around his wrists and forearms. In gameplay, the blades can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. A new weapons mechanic called the World Weapon system allows Kratos to pick up weapons scattered throughout game locations <b>or</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> them from defeated foes, and to use these for a limited time. There are five World Weapons (sword, club, javelin, sling, shield) that can be collected randomly, although Kratos may possess only one at any time. When a World Weapon is not equipped, Kratos may punch or kick foes {{as part of the}} new combat system. Another new mechanic is that Kratos can tether enemies, referred to as grappling; he can hold an enemy in place with one blade while he attacks other enemies with the other blade, and he can throw the tethered enemy.|$|E

5|$|Never 7 is {{a visual}} novel {{in which the}} player reads the story, and presses a button to advance through the text. At certain points, the player gets to make choices which affect the {{direction}} the plot proceeds in; these involve choosing what location to move to, and what the player character should say, as well as subtler choices such as whether to look {{a girl in the}} eyes <b>or</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> her hand. The game is presented from a first-person perspective, with pre-rendered backgrounds and 2D character portraits accompanying the text. The visuals mostly consist of still images, but with characters often changing their expression while talking.|$|E
5|$|Several Malaysian Members of Parliament {{have urged}} the Federal Government to assert {{sovereignty}} over Pulau Pisang {{which also has}} a lighthouse on it that is operated by Singapore, <b>or</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over administration of the lighthouse. Concerns were also expressed for Pulau Merambong near the western boundary of Malaysia and Singapore. The Menteri Besar of Johor, Abdul Ghani Othman, assured the public that Pulau Pisang belongs to Johor under a 1900 agreement between Sultan Ibrahim of Johor and British administrators in colonial Singapore. Nonetheless, Malaysian agencies have taken up efforts to stake claims over a hundred islands, reefs, rocks and other features in the South China Sea, Malacca Straits, and off Sabahan waters that Malaysia could lose to China, Indonesia and Vietnam. Two of these islands are Pulau Unarang off eastern Sabah near the Indonesian border, and Pulau Perak {{to the west of}} Penang.|$|E
5|$|Some {{parts of}} the game require timed {{responses}} from players, often leading to significant decisions that impact the game's story. Some conversation trees require players to select a response within a limited time, otherwise Reza remains silent. The game also requires action choices, wherein players must {{decide what to do}} in specific circumstances; for example, one sequences tasks players with choosing whether to take aggression during a protest, <b>or</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> photographs. Other characters will respond to the decisions accordingly, and a notification feature indicates that a character will remember the selected response. In action-based sequences, players follow on-screen prompts for quick time events in order to stay alive. Should players fail to follow the prompts in the allocated time, the game restarts from prior to the quick time event.|$|E

5|$|Like most seabirds, the {{majority}} of procellariids breed once a year. There are exceptions; many individuals of the larger species, such as the white-headed petrel, will skip a breeding season after successfully fledging a chick, {{and some of the}} smaller species, such as the Christmas shearwaters, breed on a nine-month schedule. Among those that breed annually, there is considerable variation as to the timing; some species breed in a fixed season while others breed all year round. Climate and the availability of food resources are important influences on the timing of procellariid breeding; species that breed at higher latitudes always breed in the summer as conditions are too harsh in the winter. At lower latitudes many, but not all, species breed continuously. Some species breed seasonally, to avoid competition with other species for burrows, to avoid predation <b>or</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of seasonally abundant food. Others, such as the tropical wedge-tailed shearwater, breed seasonally for reasons unknown. Among the species that exhibit seasonal breeding there can be high levels of synchronization, both of time of arrival at the colony and of lay date.|$|E
5|$|Two more {{nuclear tests}} were {{conducted}} in the Monte Bello Islands as part of Operation Mosaic in 1956, the detonations taking place on Alpha and Trimouille Islands. By the 1980s the radioactivity had decayed {{to the point where}} it was no longer hazardous to the casual visitor, but there were still radioactive metal fragments containing cobalt-60, the remains of Plym. The island remained a prohibited area until 1992. A 2006 zoological survey found that the wildlife had recovered, and that the Aprasia rostrata, the legless lizard discovered by Hill, was not extinct. As part of the Gorgon gas project, rats and feral cats were eradicated from the Monte Bello Islands in 2009, and birds and marsupials were transplanted from nearby Barrow Island to Hermite Island. Today, the Monte Bello Islands are a park. Visitors are advised not to spend more than an hour per day at the test sites, <b>or</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> relics of the tests as souvenirs. A pyramid-shaped obelisk marks the site of the explosion on Alpha Island.|$|E
5|$|The force {{tasked with}} assaulting the fort and {{capturing}} the three bridges was formed from {{elements of the}} 7th Air Division and the 22nd Airlanding Division, and was named Sturmabteilung Koch (Assault Detachment Koch) after {{the leader of the}} force, Hauptmann Walter Koch. The force, which had been assembled in November 1939, was primarily composed of parachutists from the 1st Parachute Regiment and engineers from the 7th Air Division, as well as a small group of Luftwaffe pilots. Although the force was composed primarily of parachutists, it was decided that the first landings by the force should be by glider. Adolf Hitler, who had taken a personal interest in the arrangements for the assault force, had ordered that gliders be used after being told by his personal pilot, Hanna Reitsch, that gliders in flight were nearly silent; it was believed that, since Belgian anti-aircraft defences used sound-location arrays and not radar, {{it would be possible to}} tow gliders near to the Dutch border and then release them, achieving a surprise attack as the Belgian defenders would not be able to detect them. Fifty DFS 230 transport gliders were supplied for use by the assault force, and then a period of intensive training began. A detailed study of the fort, the bridges and the local area was made, and a replica of the area was constructed for the airborne troops to train in. Joint exercises between the parachutists and the glider pilots were carried out in the early spring of 1940, and a number of refinements made to the equipment and tactics to be used, such as barbed wire being added to the nose-skids of the gliders to reduce their landing run, and the airborne troops trained with flamethrowers and specialized explosives, the latter of which were so secret that they were only used on fortifications in Germany and not on fortifications in Czechoslovakia similar to Fort Eben Emael. Secrecy was also maintained in a number of other ways. When exercises were completed gliders and equipment would be broken down and taken away in furniture vans, the sub-units of the force were frequently renamed and moved from one location to another, unit badges and insignia were removed, and the airborne troops were not permitted to leave their barracks <b>or</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> leave.|$|E
