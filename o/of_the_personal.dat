5|$|During {{the first}} quarter of the 7th century, the {{quayside}} settlement at Gipeswic (Ipswich) became an important estuarine trading centre, receiving imported goods such as pottery from other trading markets situated around the coasts of the North Sea. Steven Plunkett suggests that the founding of Gipeswic took place under Wuffingas supervision. It took another hundred years for the settlement to develop into a town, but its beginnings can be seen as a reflection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> importance of Rædwald during the period of his supremacy.|$|E

5|$|Engelbart {{slipped into}} {{relative}} obscurity after 1976. Several of his researchers became alienated {{from him and}} left his organization for Xerox PARC, {{in part due to}} frustration, and in part due to differing views of the future of computing. Engelbart saw the future in collaborative, networked, timeshare (client-server) computers, which younger programmers rejected in favor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> computer. The conflict was both technical and ideological: the younger programmers came from an era where centralized power was highly suspect, and personal computing was just barely on the horizon.|$|E

5|$|A {{long period}} of peace between Parthia and Rome ensued, with only the {{invasion}} of Alans into Parthia's eastern territories around 72AD mentioned by Roman historians. Whereas Augustus and Nero had chosen a cautious military policy when confronting Parthia, later Roman emperors invaded and attempted to conquer the eastern Fertile Crescent, {{the heart of the}} Parthian Empire along the Tigris and Euphrates. The heightened aggression can be explained in part by Rome's military reforms. To match Parthia's strength in missile troops and mounted warriors, the Romans at first used foreign allies (especially Nabataeans), but later established a permanent auxilia force to complement their heavy legionary infantry. The Romans eventually maintained regiments of horse archers (sagittarii) and even mail-armored cataphracts in their eastern provinces. Yet the Romans had no discernible grand strategy in dealing with Parthia and gained very little territory from these invasions. The primary motivations for war were the advancement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> glory and political position of the emperor, as well as defending Roman honor against perceived slights such as Parthian interference in the affairs of Rome's client states.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{memoirs of}} Ken Flower, then the {{director}} of Rhodesia's Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), Harper's downfall {{was the result of}} an extramarital affair with a young secretary in the Rhodesian civil service who the CIO discovered was an agent for MI6. Flower informed Smith of this on 3 July and the Prime Minister demanded Harper's resignation that afternoon; Harper acquiesced the next day. Because this was kept secret (presuming it is true), Harper's sudden departure from the Cabinet was interpreted by many observers at the time as the culmination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> and political rivalry between Smith and Harper, or the result of disagreements over the new constitution.|$|E
5|$|As Saeed was {{the vice}} {{president}} of the Iraq Football Association, which was headed by Uday Hussein, in the 1990s, there were many controversies about him being a Ba'athist and a Saddamist. He was also accused of being of a Palestinian descent, torturing players, giving positions to Tikritis. Accusations also went to say that Saeed was Uday's representative in robbing Kuwaitis in the 1991 Gulf War. Documents were put on the internet by some news agencies that suggest that Saeed, Najeh Humoud and Moayad Al-Badri worked for the Iraqi Intelligence Service in 2002 by gathering information on their targets. The documents included Saeed gathering information about Al-Badri when he was staying in Saudi Arabia before joining them himself. They also show the approval <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Personal</b> Secretary of Former President Saddam Hussein, Abid Hamid Mahmud, of paying Saeed $50,000 after completing his mission and him signing on receiving $25,000. One of the documents showed him and Al-Badri executing a mission to monitor an alleged Israeli spy in Syria and showed him arresting Yahya Alwan before travelling to Saudi Arabia.|$|E

The State Tax Inspectorate has an office in Šiaurės Miestelis, providing services to private as well as legal persons. There are also several medicine-related institutions, such as the Ministry of Health's State Public Health Service, the Vilnius city morgue. The Institute of Forensic Medicine of the Mykolas Romeris University was headquartered in Šiaurės Miestelis as well. The Lithuanian National Olympic Committee, the Vilnius Department of the Lithuanian Labour Exchange at the Ministry of Social Security and Labour, the Honorary Vice-Consulate of the Kingdom of Spain, and the National Examination Center, established by the Ministry of Education to organize centralized nationwide examinations of high school graduates, all have headquarters in Žirmūnai.|$|E
5|$|Forster's force landed {{near the}} American-occupied fort on May 18, and sent in {{a demand for}} surrender. Butterfield countered with a request to {{withdraw}} under arms, which Forster refused. The parties exchanged fire. During {{the course of the}} exchange, Forster received word that Sherburne had crossed the Ottawa River from the island of Montreal to Quinze-Chênes, but, believing The Cedars to have fallen already, had retreated back across the river. This news caused the besiegers to redouble their efforts the next day. Additional help arrived for the British in the form of about 40Canadiens under Jean-Baptiste Testard de Montigny; Forster sent them to harass Sherburne. Word then came to Forster that Sherburne had resumed his advance; Butterfield, unaware of this, surrendered the fort. The terms of capitulation included a guarantee <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> safety of the captured men. The Iroquois plundered the fort's stores, and denied some of the captives small pouches of sometimes valuable personal items.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, after {{constructing}} two {{welfare reform}} bills that Clinton vetoed, Gingrich {{and his supporters}} pushed for passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Personal</b> Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which was intended to reconstruct the welfare system. The act gave state governments more autonomy over welfare delivery, while also reducing the federal government's responsibilities. It instituted the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which placed time limits on welfare assistance and replaced the longstanding Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Other changes to the welfare system included stricter conditions for food stamp eligibility, reductions in immigrant welfare assistance, and work requirements for recipients. The bill {{was signed into law}} by President Clinton on August 22, 1996.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} religion, Protestant ideas first {{appeared}} {{in the middle of the}} 16th century. During Gáspár Heltai's service as preacher, Lutheranism grew in importance, as did the Swiss doctrine of Calvinism. By 1571, the Turda (Torda) Diet had adopted a more radical religion, Ferenc Dávid's Unitarianism, characterised by the free interpretation of the Bible and denial of the dogma of the Trinity. Stephen Báthory founded a Catholic Jesuit academy in the city in order to promote an anti-Reform movement; however, it did not have much success. For a year, in 1600–1601, Cluj became part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> union of Michael the Brave. Under the Treaty of Carlowitz in 1699, it became part of the Habsburg Monarchy.|$|E

Carlota, {{he was charged with}} {{transporting}} what remained <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> property of Prince Regent Dom João, later King Dom JoãoVI to Brazil. José de Barros also brought his family on the voyage, including Joaquim Inácio, who was then one year and eight months old. Joaquim Inácio had an older sister named Maria and six younger siblings (who were born after the arrival in Brazil), among them Bento José de Carvalho and Antônio José Vitorino de Barros.|$|E
5|$|Oskar Gröning (sometimes transliterated as Oscar Groening in English; born 10 June 1921) is a German former SS junior squad {{leader who}} was {{stationed}} at Auschwitz concentration camp.

He was eventually transferred to Britain as a prisoner of war and worked as a forced labourer.|$|E

5|$|The {{demographic}} {{history of}} Slavonia is characterised by significant migrations, as {{is that of}} Croatia as a whole, starting {{with the arrival of}} the Croats, between the 6th and 9th centuries. Following the establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> union of Croatia and Hungary in 1102, and the joining of the Habsburg Empire in 1527, the Hungarian and German speaking population of Croatia began gradually increasing in number. The processes of Magyarization and Germanization varied in intensity but persisted until the beginning of the 20th century. The Ottoman conquests initiated a westward migration of parts of the Croatian population; the Burgenland Croats are direct descendants of some of those settlers. To replace the fleeing Croats the Habsburgs called on the Orthodox populations of Bosnia and Serbia to provide military service in the Croatian Military Frontier. Serb migration into this region peaked during the Great Serb Migrations of 1690 and 1737–39. Following the collapse of Austria-Hungary in 1918, the Hungarian population declined, due to emigration and ethnic bias. The changes were especially significant in the areas north of the Drava river, and Baranja County where they represented the majority before World War I.|$|E
5|$|The {{representatives of}} France, Great Britain, and the Dutch Republic signed the Treaty of Utrecht on 11 April 1713 (N.S.) – the Emperor and his German allies, {{including}} the Elector of Hanover, continued {{with the war}} before finally accepting the general settlement the following year. The Treaty marked Britain's emergence as a great power. Domestically, however, the country remained divided between Whig and Tory, Jacobite and Hanoverian factions. By now Oxford and St John (Viscount Bolingbroke since 1712) – absorbed entirely by their mutual enmity and political squabbling – had effectively wrecked the Tory administration. Marlborough had been kept well informed of events while in exile and had remained a powerful figure on the political scene, not least because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> attachment the Queen still retained for him. After {{the death of his}} daughter Elizabeth from smallpox in March 1714, Marlborough contacted the Queen. Although the contents of the letter are unknown it is possible that Anne may have summoned him home. Either way, it seems that an agreement was reached to reinstate the Duke in his former offices.|$|E
5|$|Typical Tamil Hindu rituals at Kataragama such as fire walking, Kavadi {{dance and}} body {{piercing}} {{have been taken}} over by the Buddhists and have been spread {{to the rest of the}} island. The Buddhist takeover of the temple and its rituals has profoundly affected the rationale nature of austere Theravada Buddhism practiced in Sri Lanka to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> Bhakti veneration of deities found amongst the Hindus of Sri Lanka and South India. The loss of Hindu influence within the temple complex has negatively affected the Sri Lankan Tamil Hindu society. According to Paul Younger, the Buddhist takeover was precipitated by the overwhelming participation of Buddhists in what are essentially Hindu rituals that worried the Buddhist establishment. There is a strong political and religious pressure to further modify the temple rituals to conform within an orthodox Theravada Buddhist world view.|$|E
