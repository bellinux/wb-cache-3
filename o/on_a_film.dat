5|$|After Pelacur, Sarumpaet {{began working}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> {{adaptation}} entitled Jamila dan Sang Presiden (Jamila and the President). The film's production took three years, {{due in part}} to a lack of funding; the total budget was Rp.6.5 billion (US$800,000) Released on 30 April 2009, the film was well received both domestically and internationally. It was submitted to the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, but not nominated.|$|E

5|$|After {{considering}} {{pursuing a}} master's degree {{on the topic}} of hard science fiction novels as fascist literature, Gibson discontinued writing in the year that followed graduation and, as one critic put it, expanded his collection of punk records. During this period he worked at various jobs, including a three-year stint as teaching assistant <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> history course at his alma mater. Impatient at much of what he saw at a science fiction convention in Vancouver in 1980 or 1981, Gibson found a kindred spirit in fellow panelist, punk musician and author John Shirley. The two became immediate and lifelong friends. Shirley persuaded Gibson to sell his early short stories and to take writing seriously.|$|E
5|$|Hayao Miyazaki {{made his}} {{credited}} directorial debut in 1979 with The Castle of Cagliostro, a film {{which was a}} distinct departure from the antics of the Lupin III franchise, but still went on to receive the Ofuji Noburo Award at the 1979 Mainichi Film Concours. Although Cagliostro was not a box office success, Toshio Suzuki, editor of the magazine Animage, {{was impressed by the}} film and encouraged Miyazaki to produce works for Animage's publisher, Tokuma Shoten. Miyazaki's film ideas were rejected, and Tokuma asked him to do a manga: this {{led to the creation of}} Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. Miyazaki began writing and drawing the manga in 1981, and it quickly became Animage's most popular feature. Hideo Ogata and Yasuyoshi Tokuma, the founders of Animage and Tokuma Shoten respectively, encouraged Miyazaki to work <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> adaptation. Miyazaki initially refused, but agreed on the condition that he could direct.|$|E
5|$|In 1956 Rivette {{made the}} short film Le Coup du Berger, which Truffaut {{credited}} as enacting the New Wave movement. The following year he {{began work on}} his first feature film with the initial support of Italian neorealist director Roberto Rossellini. Paris Belongs to Us {{was shot in the}} summer of 1958, but not released theatrically until 1961, after Chabrol, Truffaut and Godard had their feature-film debuts distributed and made the New Wave renowned worldwide. After staging a theatrical version of Denis Diderot's novel La Religieuse starring Anna Karina in 1963, Rivette became the editor-in-chief of Cahiers du Cinéma until 1965. He then began production <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> version of La Religieuse, which led to a lengthy public battle with French censorship over the film's release. Finally released in 1967, the publicity made it financially successful.|$|E

5|$|In 2004–05, {{researchers}} from Dubna and Livermore identified a new dubnium isotope, 268Db, as a fivefold alpha decay {{product of the}} newly created element 115. This new isotope proved to be long-lived enough to allow chemical experimentation. In the 2004 experiment, a thin layer {{was removed from the}} surface of the target (with dubnium on it), dissolved in aqua regia with tracers and lanthanum carrier, from which precipitated various +3, +4, and +5 species on adding ammonium hydroxide. The precipitate was washed and dissolved in hydrochloric acid, in which it was converted to nitrate form then dried <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> and counted. It mostly contained a +5 species, which was immediately assigned to dubnium, but also a +4 species; based on that result, the team decided that additional chemical separation was needed. In 2005, the experiment was repeated, with the final product being hydroxide rather than nitrate precipitate, which was processed further at both Livermore (based on reverse phase chromatography) and Dubna (based on anion exchange chromatography). The +5 species was effectively isolated; dubnium in that experiment appeared three times in tantalum-only fractions and not even once in niobium-only fractions. However, it was noted that these experiments were insufficient to draw conclusions about the general chemical profile of dubnium.|$|E
5|$|Michael J. Fox was {{the first}} choice to play Marty McFly, but he was {{committed}} to the show Family Ties. Family Ties producer Gary David Goldberg felt that Fox was essential to the show's success. With co-star Meredith Baxter on maternity leave, he refused to allow Fox time off to work <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>film.</b> Back to the Future was originally scheduled for a May 1985 release and it was late 1984 when it was learned that Fox {{would be unable to}} star in the film. Zemeckis' next two choices were C. Thomas Howell and Eric Stoltz. Stoltz impressed the producers enough with his earlier portrayal of Roy L. Dennis in Mask (which had yet to be released) that they selected him to play Marty McFly. Because of the difficult casting process, the start date was pushed back twice.|$|E
5|$|On {{one of her}} adventures, Riefenstahl met Luis Trenker, who was {{an actor}} from Der Berg des Schicksals. At a meeting {{arranged}} by her friend Gunther Rahn, she met Arnold Fanck, the director of Der Berg des Schicksals and a pioneer of the mountain film genre. Fanck was working <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> in Berlin. After Riefenstahl told him how much she admired his work, she also convinced him of her acting skill. She persuaded him to feature her {{in one of his}} movies. Riefenstahl later received a package from Fanck containing the script of the 1926 film Der Heilige Berg ("The Holy Mountain"). She made a series of films for Fanck, where she learned from him acting and film editing techniques. One of Fanck's films that brought Riefenstahl into the limelight was Die Weisse Hölle vom Piz Palü ("The White Hell of Piz Palü") of 1929, co-directed by G. W. Pabst. Her fame spread to countries outside Germany.|$|E

5|$|Scott Frank {{was hired}} to write the {{screenplay}} in February 1999, after approaching Warner Bros. for the job. Frank, a recent Oscar nominee for the R-rated crime film Out of Sight, wanted to work <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> that his children could enjoy. As an enthusiastic fan of the book, he intended to remain more truthful to Dahl's vision than the 1971 film had been. Nicolas Cage was under discussions for Willy Wonka, but lost interest. Gary Ross signed to direct in February 2000, which resulted in Frank completing two drafts of the screenplay, before leaving with Ross in September 2001. Both Warner Bros. and the Dahl Estate wanted Frank {{to stay on the}} project, but he faced scheduling conflicts and contractual obligations with Minority Report (2002) and The Lookout (2007).|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year, pre-production {{began again}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> with a treatment called Planet of the Titans and subsequent script produced by British writers Chris Bryant and Allan Scott {{with the intention}} of keeping costs down by filming in the United Kingdom. There were difficulties in ensuring that both William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy were signed to the film as Shatner's deal with Paramount had expired and Nimoy was concerned with unauthorized merchandising. Philip Kaufman was signed up to direct, after several others were asked first. The plot would have seen the crew investigating the homeworld of the mythical Titans, and in escaping through a black hole are hurled into the prehistoric past where they teach early man how to make fire.|$|E

5|$|The person’s throat {{is first}} swabbed {{to collect a}} sample of mucus. In most RSTs, this mucus sample is then exposed to a reagent {{containing}} antibodies that will bind specifically to a GAS antigen. A positive result is signified by a certain visible reaction. There are three major types of RST: First, a latex fixation test, which was developed in the 1980s and is largely obsolete. It employs latex beads covered with antigens that will visibly agglutinate around GAS antibodies if these are present. Second, a lateral flow test, which is currently the most widely used RST. The sample is applied to a strip of nitrocellulose film and, if GAS antigens are present, these will migrate along the film to form a visible line of antigen bound to labeled antibodies. Third, optical immunoassay is the newest and more expensive test. It involves mixing the sample with labeled antibodies and then with a special substrate <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> which changes colour to signal {{the presence or absence of}} GAS antigen.|$|E
5|$|The scenes set in Cyprus were filmed on {{location}} in Deià, a coastal village in the island of Majorca. Previously working <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> using the same location, producer Chris Fry chose the village because {{he felt it was}} the closest to the UK the crew can get to mimic the hot, Mediterranean feel of Cyprus. Because filming abroad tend to be costly for a BBC budget, the producers kept costs down as much as possible by using a limited crew with some local help. Much of the original script was to take place inside a house, but because there were no gaffers responsible for lighting, and that the weather was decent, filming took place primarily outside because of the natural sunlight. The filming crew spent four days at the end of April shooting in Majorca.|$|E

5|$|Vidya {{grew up in}} the {{suburban}} neighbourhood of Chembur, Mumbai and attended St. Anthony Girls' High School. From a young age she aspired to a career in film and was inspired by the work of actors Shabana Azmi and Madhuri Dixit. At the age of 16, she starred in the first season of Ekta Kapoor's sitcom Hum Paanch as Radhika, a bespectacled teenager. Following the success of the show, Vidya refused director Anurag Basu's offer to star in a television soap opera, as she wanted to concentrate <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> career. Her parents were supportive of the decision but encouraged her to complete her education first. She attended St. Xavier's College to pursue a bachelor's degree in sociology and later earned a master's degree from the University of Mumbai.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, Yasuyoshi Tokuma, the founder Tokuma Shoten, {{encouraged}} Miyazaki to work <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> adaptation. Miyazaki initially refused, but agreed {{on the condition that}} he could direct. Miyazaki's imagination was sparked by the mercury poisoning of Minamata Bay and how nature responded and thrived in a poisoned environment, using it to create the film's polluted world. Miyazaki and Takahata chose the minor studio Topcraft to animate the film, as they believed its artistic talent could transpose the sophisticated atmosphere of the manga to the film. Pre-production began on May 31, 1983; Miyazaki encountered difficulties in creating the screenplay, with only sixteen chapters of the manga to work with. Takahata enlisted experimental and minimalist musician Joe Hisaishi to compose the film's score. Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind was released on March 11, 1984. It grossed ¥1.48 billion at the box office, and made an additional ¥742 million in distribution income. It is often seen as Miyazaki's pivotal work, cementing his reputation as an animator. It was lauded for its positive portrayal of women, particularly that of main character Nausicaä. Several critics have labeled Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind as possessing anti-war and feminist themes; Miyazaki argues otherwise, stating that he only wishes to entertain. The successful cooperation on the creation of the manga and the film laid the foundation for other collaborative projects. In April 1984, Miyazaki opened his own office in Suginami Ward, naming it Nibariki.|$|E
