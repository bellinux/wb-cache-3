Although Dalí was criticized for accommodating Franco's regime, André Breton, the Surrealist leader and poet, asked him to represent Spain at the 1959 Homage to Surrealism Exhibition which celebrated the fortieth anniversary of Surrealism.

Coronary arteriography is the most helpful investigation in assessing the physiopathology of the rare event. These patients merit a careful scrutiny due to an increased death rate because of cardiopulmonary arrest. Here, we reported a man with inferior myocardial infarction following electrical shock. Although he had frankly normal coronary arteries by coronary angiography, myocardial infarction was <b>objectively</b> <b>evident</b> by cardiac enzymes, electrocardiography and echocardiography. Amputation was performed on his left wrist from the elbow and fasciotomy was performed on his right wrist due to compartment syndrome. Electrocardiography changes returned to normal level within 6 th hours of electric shock. He was discharged in good health after stabilization...|$|E
