The isolation of these peoples in Beringia might have lasted 10,000–20,000 years.

40|$|How {{much can}} we turn the screw on counter-examples to the KK principle? The principle, also {{sometimes}} called “positive introspection”, says <b>that</b> if <b>one</b> knows <b>that</b> P, <b>one</b> knows <b>that</b> <b>one</b> knows <b>that</b> P. It is widely, although not universally, {{acknowledged that the}} KK principle is false, {{and not just for}} the boring reason <b>that</b> <b>one</b> can know <b>that</b> P without having formed the belief <b>that</b> <b>one</b> knows <b>that</b> P. <b>One</b> can know <b>that</b> P, and believe <b>that</b> <b>one</b> knows <b>that</b> P, without knowing <b>that</b> <b>one</b> knows <b>that</b> P, because <b>one</b> is not in a strong enough epistemic position to know <b>that</b> <b>one</b> knows <b>that</b> P (Williamson 2000 : 114 - 30). One’s epistemic position is weaker with respect to the fact <b>that</b> <b>one</b> knows <b>that</b> P than it is with respect to the fact that P itself. But how much weaker can one’s epistemic position be with respect to the fact <b>that</b> <b>one</b> knows <b>that</b> P than it is with respect to the fact that P? Of course, if <b>one</b> does know <b>that</b> P, <b>one’s</b> epistemic position with respect to the fact <b>that</b> <b>one</b> knows <b>that</b> P cannot be so bad <b>that</b> <b>one</b> positively knows <b>that</b> <b>one</b> does not know that P, as opposed to merely failing to know <b>that</b> <b>one</b> knows <b>that</b> P, for knowing is 1 factive: one can know only what is indeed the case. But we can ask a more grade...|$|R
