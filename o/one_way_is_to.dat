5|$|There are {{different}} ways to determine the value of c. <b>One</b> <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> measure the actual speed at which light waves propagate, which {{can be done in}} various astronomical and earth-based setups. However, it is also possible to determine c from other physical laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constants ε0 and μ0 and using their relation to c. Historically, the most accurate results have been obtained by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a light beam, with their product equalling c.|$|E

25|$|Value {{investing}} {{has proven}} to be a successful investment strategy. There are several ways to evaluate its success. <b>One</b> <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> examine the performance of simple value strategies, such as buying low PE ratio stocks, low price-to-cash-flow ratio stocks, or low price-to-book ratio stocks. Numerous academics have published studies investigating the effects of buying value stocks.

30|$|Next, we {{analyzed}} another weighting strategy, {{which is based}} on the guided-image filter [15]. The cost volume was computed in two <b>ways.</b> <b>One</b> <b>way</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> use a combination of the truncated absolute difference of the color and the gradient, as in [15]. The other <b>way</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> use the DAISY feature vector. On the two stereo pairs, this strategy did not produce good disparity estimates, even using both ways of computing the cost volumes. This result suggests that the weighting strategy based on the guided-image filter may not be suitable for wide-baseline stereo matching.|$|R

50|$|The Preemption Act allowed {{individuals}} to acquire federal land and claim it as property. To preserve ownership, the claimant {{had to do}} some things to legitimize the claim. <b>One</b> <b>way</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> actively residing on the land. Another <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> consistently working <b>to</b> improve the land (for a minimum of five years). It was not necessary that the claimant <b>be</b> titled <b>to</b> the land; living there and working toward improving the stake was enough. If, however, the land remained idle for six months, the government could step in and take the property.|$|R
25|$|There {{are several}} ways to play six bells at a time (i.e., to ring three bells in each hand). <b>One</b> <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> pick two bells up as if one were Shelley ringing, then pick the third up between one's little and ring fingers (a 'triple Shelley'). All three bells ring {{together}} when ringing in a knocking motion. A second way is to pick up the third bell sideways so the clapper swings outward. Ringers with good control can then ring the first bell without ringing the third, allowing him or her to play three notes in one hand.|$|E
25|$|Scientist have {{discovered}} {{it is possible}} to determine, to some extent, the presence of these compounds in the grape before harvest. <b>One</b> <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> measured with gas chromatograph-mass spectrometers. Another method is through analysis of the glycosyl-glucose assay. Through this method glycosides from the grape juice are isolated and then hydrolysized to yield glucose. The amount of glucose produced is then quantified and tabulated in results that are expressed as amount of glycosides in micromoles per liter or per grape berry. The relationship between the presence of glycosides in wine grapes and the potential for quality in the resulting wine is not exact science but this remains an area of continuing research and development.|$|E

[...] Here, one should note that such a category would have the Radon–Nikodym property, that is, the Radon–Nikodym theorem holds in this category. This includes the Hilbert spaces; these are square-integrable, and in the manipulations above, this is sufficient to safely replace to sum over squares by an integral over squares.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} methods for forming {{internal}} cavities in extrusions. <b>One</b> <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use a hollow billet {{and then use}} a fixed or floating mandrel. A fixed mandrel, {{also known as a}} German type, means it is integrated into the dummy block and stem. A floating mandrel, also known as a French type, floats in slots in the dummy block and aligns itself in the die when extruding. If a solid billet is used as the feed material then it must first be pierced by the mandrel before extruding through the die. A special press is used in order to control the mandrel independently from the ram. The solid billet could also be used with a spider die, porthole die or bridge die. All of these types of dies incorporate the mandrel in the die and have [...] "legs" [...] that hold the mandrel in place. During extrusion the metal divides, flows around the legs, then merges, leaving weld lines in the final product.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} ways to enumerate k combinations. <b>One</b> <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> visit all the binary numbers less than 2n. Choose those numbers having k nonzero bits, {{although}} this is very inefficient even for small n (e.g. n = 20 would require visiting about one million numbers while the maximum number of allowed k combinations is about 186 thousand for k = 10). The positions of these 1 bits in such a number is a specific k-combination of the set { 1, …, n }. Another simple, faster way is to track k index numbers of the elements selected, starting with {0 [...]. k−1} (zero-based) or {1 [...]. k} (one-based) as the first allowed k-combination and then repeatedly moving to the next allowed k-combination by incrementing the last index number if it is lower than n-1 (zero-based) or n (one-based) or the last index number x that is less than the index number following it minus one if such an index exists and resetting the index numbers after x to {x+1, x+2, …}.|$|E
2500|$|When compared, {{groundwater}} {{heat pumps}} {{are generally more}} efficient than heat pumps using heat from the soil.

One way to fix cold accumulation in the ground heat exchanger loop, is to use ground water to cool the floors of the building on hot days, thereby transferring heat from the dwelling into the ground loop. There are several other methods for replenishing a low temperature ground loop; <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> make large solar collectors, for instance by putting plastic pipes just under the roof, or by putting coils of black polyethylene pipes under glass on the roof, or by piping the tarmac of the parking lot.

2500|$|Clinical {{assessment}} can {{be characterized}} as a prediction problem where the purpose of assessment is to make inferences (predictions) about past, present, or future behavior. For example, many therapy decisions are {{made on the basis of}} what a clinician expects will help a patient make therapeutic gains. Once observations have been collected (e.g., psychological test results, diagnostic impressions, clinical history, X-ray, etc.), there are two mutually exclusive ways to combine those sources of information to arrive at a decision, diagnosis, or prediction. <b>One</b> <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> combine the data in an algorithmic, or [...] "mechanical" [...] fashion. Mechanical prediction methods are simply a mode of combination of data to arrive at a decision/prediction of behavior (e.g., treatment response). Mechanical prediction does not preclude any type of data from being combined; it can incorporate clinical judgments, properly coded, in the algorithm. The defining characteristic is that, once the data to be combined is given, the mechanical approach will make a prediction that is 100% reliable. That is, it will make exactly the same prediction for exactly the same data every time. Clinical prediction, on the other hand, does not guarantee this, as it depends on the decision-making processes of the clinician making the judgment, their current state of mind, and knowledge base.|$|E
