Turkish Satellite Assembly, Integration and Test Center (UMET) is a spacecraft production and testing facility owned by the Ministry of National Defence and operated by the Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI). The Turkish Space Launch System (UFS) is a project to develop the satellite launch capability of Turkey. It consists of the construction of a spaceport, the development of satellite launch vehicles as well as the establishment of remote earth stations. Türksat is the sole communications satellite operator in Turkey and has launched the Türksat series of satellites into orbit. Göktürk-1 and Göktürk-2 are Turkey's earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites</b> for reconnaissance, operated by the Ministry of National Defence. BILSAT-1 and RASAT are the scientific earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites</b> operated by the TÜBİTAK Space Technologies Research Institute.|$|E
5|$|This list {{of space}} telescopes (astronomical space observatories) is grouped by major {{frequency}} ranges: gamma ray, x-ray, ultraviolet, visible, infrared, microwave and radio. Telescopes {{that work in}} multiple frequency bands are included {{in all of the}} appropriate sections. Space telescopes that collect particles, such as cosmic ray nuclei and/or electrons, as well as instruments that aim to detect gravitational waves, are also listed. Missions with specific targets within the Solar System (e.g. our Sun and its planets), are excluded; see List of Solar System probes for these, and List of Earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites</b> for missions targeting our planet.|$|E

25|$|Japan's first Earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites</b> were MOS-1a and MOS-1b {{launched}} in 1987 and 1990.

25|$|Starting from 1979 with Hakucho (CORSA-b), {{for nearly}} two decades Japan had {{achieved}} continuous observation with its Hinotori, Tenma, Ginga and ASCA (ASTRO-A through D) x-ray <b>observation</b> <b>satellites.</b> However, in the year 2000 the launch of Japan's fifth x-ray observation satellite, ASTRO-E failed (as it failed at launch it never received a proper name).|$|E
25|$|Earth <b>observation</b> <b>{{satellites}}</b> and spy satellites use LEO as {{they are}} able to see the surface of the Earth more clearly {{as they are}} not so far away. They are also able to traverse the surface of the Earth. A majority of artificial satellites are placed in LEO, making one complete revolution around the Earth in about 90 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Japan's first {{missions}} beyond Earth orbit {{were the}} 1985 Halley's comet <b>observation</b> <b>satellites</b> Sakigake (MS-T5) and Suisei (PLANET-A). To prepare for future missions, ISAS tested Earth swing by orbits with the Hiten mission in 1990. The first Japanese interplanetary mission was the Mars Orbiter Nozomi (PLANET-B), which {{was launched in}} 1998. It reached its target in 2003, but orbit injection had to be given up.|$|E

25|$|Satellites {{are used}} for many purposes. Common types include {{military}} and civilian Earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites,</b> communications satellites, navigation satellites, weather satellites, and space telescopes. Space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites. Satellite orbits vary greatly, depending on {{the purpose of the}} satellite, and are classified in a number of ways. Well-known (overlapping) classes include low Earth orbit, polar orbit, and geostationary orbit.|$|E
25|$|NPAFC members {{identify}} IUU {{fishing vessels}} by utilizing satellite reconnaissance and performing aerial and cutter patrols. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada assists US Coast Guard Cutters and USCG C130's by performing reconnaissance in CP-140 Aurora fix-winged aircraft over {{the east and}} central North Pacific. The Japanese Coast Guard deploys Citation V aircraft and CG cutters to intercept IUU vessels, while Russia deploys Kamov KA-27 helicopters and patrol vessels. All vessels and aircraft are assisted by RADARSAT-2 Earth <b>Observation</b> <b>satellites.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the year}} 2009 JAXA {{plans to launch}} the first {{satellite}} of the Quasi Zenith Satellite System (QZSS), a subsystem of the global positioning system (GPS). Two others are expected to follow later. If successful, one satellite {{will be in a}} zenith position over Japan full-time. The QZSS mission is the last scheduled major independent mission for JAXA, as no major civilian projects were funded after that for now. The only exception is the IGS programme which will be continued beyond 2008. However it seems Japan is pressing forward now with the GCOM earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites</b> as successors to the ADEOS missions. First launch is planned for 2010.|$|E

25|$|Indian Remote Sensing {{satellites}} (IRS) are {{a series}} of earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites,</b> built, launched and maintained by ISRO. The IRS series provides remote sensing services to the country. The Indian Remote Sensing Satellite system is the largest constellation of remote sensing satellites for civilian use in operation today in the world. All the satellites are placed in polar Sun-synchronous orbit and provide data in a variety of spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions to enable several programmes to be undertaken relevant to national development. The initial versions are composed of the 1 (A, B, C, D) nomenclature. The later versions are named based on their area of application including OceanSat, CartoSat, ResourceSat.|$|E
25|$|ISRO built India's first satellite, Aryabhata, {{which was}} {{launched}} by the Soviet Union on 19 April 1975. It was named after the Mathematician Aryabhata. In 1980, Rohini became the first satellite {{to be placed in}} orbit by an Indian-made launch vehicle, SLV-3. ISRO subsequently developed two other rockets: the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) for launching satellites into polar orbits and the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) for placing satellites into geostationary orbits. These rockets have launched numerous communications satellites and earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites.</b> Satellite navigation systems like GAGAN and IRNSS have been deployed. In January 2014, ISRO successfully used an indigenous cryogenic engine in a GSLV-D5 launch of the GSAT-14.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{operational}} goal {{of satellite}} AIS is {{the gathering of}} positioning and course information from fisheries and ship traffic within the Norwegian EEZ {{with the intent of}} environmental surveillance. The vessel data is used by the Coastal Administration and in particular Vardø Vessel Traffic Service Centre to monitor ship traffic. The data is stored and {{can also be used to}} collect accurate statistics on ship traffic in the Arctic. Unlike terrestrial data collection, the satellite information is not made publicly available. A contributing cause is that certain fishers many not want to reveal their fishing positions and could then have chosen to turn off their AIS instead. Data can also be used to identify any ship causing an oil spill. There are more than one thousand annual oil spills and illegal dumping in Norwegian waters. While <b>observation</b> <b>satellites</b> have previously been able to identify spills, the satellite AIS monitoring can normally identify the culprit and the data used as evidence.|$|E
