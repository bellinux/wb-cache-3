40|$|Cereal {{residues}} are {{an important}} feed source for ruminants in smallholder crop-livestock systems in the (sub) tropics. In many areas of India maize {{is a relatively new}} cash crop where farmers and development agents alike generally perceive maize stover to have limited utility, in contrast with the intensive feeding <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>cereal</b> residues in India and the intensive use of maize stover in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. A comparative assessment of maize stover quality (based on a brief review and a feeding trial) indeed confirms its potential as a ruminant feed according to its relative nutritive value. The paper then explores the apparent paradox through a scoping study of maize stover use (based on village surveys) in three contrasting maize-growing districts in India – including both traditional and non-traditional maize producers. The limited maize stover use appears to alleviate seasonal shortages, with tradition and technology helping explain the preferential use <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>cereal</b> residues. The paper thereby provides further impetus to India's apparent food-feed paradigm – whereby farmers’ staple food preferences coincide with crop residue feed preferences. The paper argues the case for investing in maize stover R&D in India and thus reigniting earlier feed research in general. Indeed, maize stover use is a relatively neglected area by India's agricultural R&D and merits more attention so as to exploit its potential contribution and alleviate eventual tradeoffs...|$|R

Western Plains, causing {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars of losses to wheat and barley production through reduced yields and insecticide application costs. The objectives of this research were to evaluate the performance of two RWA-resistant barley varieties planted approximately one month earlier than normal in experimental fields at Fort Collins, Colorado; Tribune, Kansas; and Sidney, Nebraska during 2007, 2008, and 2009. The experimental design was a split-plot design with two main plot treatments (early and normal planting dates), and four split plot treatments (barley varieties) that were randomized within each main treatment plot. The varieties included two RWA-barley resistant varieties, Sidney and Stoneham, and the susceptible variety, Otis, under thiamethoxam-protected and unprotected regimes. Sampling <b>of</b> RWA, <b>other</b> <b>cereal</b> aphids, and natural enemy populations was conducted on four dates from mid May through early July. RWA populations collected from early-planted plots (first week of March) were significantly lower than normal-planted plots in 2007 - 2009 at the Fort Collins, Colorado and Tribune, Kansas sites. In samples collected from early planting date plots, RWA-resistant varieties yielded RWA populations similar to those found on the insecticide-treated susceptible variety at both Fort Collins and Tribune. At the Sidney, Nebraska site, very low RWA populations were present and there were no differences between either planting date or varietal treatments. The combined effect of early planting and RWA-resistant varieties reduced RWA populations at the Fort Collins, Colorado site in all three years. Results were similar at the Tribune, Kansas site in 2007, but differences due to planting date or variety were not observed in 2008 or 2009. The lowest RWA populations occurred at the Sidney, Nebraska site, were independent of planting date and varietal treatments. The RWA-resistant barley varieties had no negative impact on populations <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>cereal</b> aphids compared to those found on the susceptible variety, Otis at any of the three research sites. The only treatment effective in reducing <b>other</b> <b>cereal</b> aphids was the insecticide, thiamethoxam. There was also no clear response <b>of</b> populations <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>cereal</b> aphids to different planting date.

Little {{is known about the}} effects of this “bio-approach” on properties <b>of</b> <b>others</b> <b>cereal,</b> as maize. This cereal and its by-products could represent attractive alternative raw materials for fiber enrichment of gluten-free products. According to A.I.R.E.S (Associazione Italiana Essiccatori Raccoglitori Stoccatori di Cereali e Semi oleosi, [URL] about 82 % of maize production is used for animal feed and only 18 % is devoted to human consumption. At the milling stage, dry maize mechanical processing creates whole or fractionated products, accounting about for up to 25 %, generally used as animal feed or biofuel. In this context, the valorization of maize by-products as valuable food ingredients to be exploited in the production of new food formulation could represent an opportunity.|$|R

Most importantly, the use of standard, good agricultural practices must be maintained throughout the rice cultivation season to increase grain yield for food and straw biomass for the bioenergy supply chain. Because grain from multifunctional transgenic rice would {{be used as a}} staple food, concerns regarding genetically modified food might be raised by consumers. A possible means to avoid this uneasiness is to use advanced genetic manipulation techniques, i.e. QTL-based methods, to precisely edit or modify only the rice genome rather than importing foreign genes from other species. The creation of a multifunctional rice is a challenging task; nonetheless, as we have discussed, opportunities exist to make it a reality. This promising endeavour can have profound bioeconomic benefits.|$|R
