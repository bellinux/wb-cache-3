2500|$|In 1976, {{the company}} name was changed to Northern Telecom Limited, and {{management}} announced its intention to concentrate the company's efforts on digital technology. Northern Telecom was the first company in its industry to announce and to deliver a complete line of fully digital telecommunications products. The product line was branded [...] "Digital World" [...] and included the well known DMS-100, a fully digital central <b>office</b> <b>switch</b> serving as many as 100,000 lines, which was a key contributor to the company's revenue for close to 15 years.|$|E
50|$|In 1990, Siemens Communications Systems {{acquired}} Florida based Stromberg-Carlson, {{expanding their}} central <b>office</b> <b>switch</b> supplier {{role in the}} public telephone network.|$|E
50|$|A marker {{is a type}} {{of special}} purpose control system that was used in {{electromechanical}} telephone central <b>office</b> <b>switches.</b> Central <b>office</b> <b>switches</b> are the large devices that telephone companies use to make the connections that support telephone calls. The switch makes voice connections between users, and to control equipment such as that used to detect dialed numbers.|$|R

50|$|While a tone-to-pulse {{converter}} {{could be}} deployed to any existing mechanical office line using 1970s technology, its speed {{would be limited}} to pulse dialing rates.The new central <b>office</b> <b>switches</b> were backward-compatible with rotary dialing.|$|R
50|$|The Nortel Networks DMS-100 {{telephone}} central <b>office</b> <b>switch</b> {{also used}} the 68020 as the first microprocessor of the SuperNode computing core.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to PBX conferencing systems, the two calls are {{joined at the}} Central <b>Office</b> <b>switch,</b> {{rather than at the}} customer premises PBX.|$|E
5000|$|The second [...] "flash" [...] {{signals the}} Central <b>Office</b> <b>Switch</b> {{to link the}} two active conversations, so that all three parties are {{connected}} to the same logical telephone line.|$|E
50|$|This section {{describes}} how the original style, standalone, voicemail system worked with a corporate PBX. The principle is the same with Central <b>Office</b> <b>Switches</b> (CO Switches) or Mobile Telephone <b>Switching</b> <b>Office</b> (MTSOs). More modern voice-mail systems work on the same principle, {{but some of the}} components may be shared with other systems, such as email systems.|$|R
50|$|Work is {{currently}} underway {{to turn the}} unused side platforms and former entrance/exits into storage space and <b>offices.</b> <b>Switching</b> system panels can be seen through new windows on the now walled off western side platform.|$|R
25|$|One {{way is to}} {{have enough}} {{switching}} fabric {{to assure that the}} pairwise allocation will always succeed by building a fully connected mesh network. This is the method usually used in central <b>office</b> <b>switches,</b> which have low utilization of their resources.|$|R
50|$|The line {{cards in}} a {{telephone}} central <b>office</b> <b>switch</b> that are interfaced to analog lines include hybrids that adapt the four-wire network to the two-wire circuits that connect most subscribers.|$|E
5000|$|Central Office Metuchen (Switch ID: MTCHNJMTDS5) (Area Code 732): Serving the Towns of Edison, Metuchen and Iselin (Technically Iselin Numbers {{that have}} 732-283 and 732-404 are routed {{out of the}} Woodbridge <b>Office</b> <b>Switch</b> ID: WDBRNJWDDS5).|$|E
5000|$|Direct Access Test Units (DATUs) {{are special}} PSTN phone numbers that {{terminate}} {{at the central}} <b>office</b> <b>switch</b> in a telephone company's local exchange that provide switchmen and telco technicians with a circuit for testing lines in various ways.|$|E
5000|$|DCO (Digital Central <b>Office),</b> a {{time-division}} <b>switch</b> {{similar to}} DMS-10. The Stromberg-Carlson DCO {{was the first}} Class-5 digital local <b>office</b> <b>switching</b> system installed in the U.S. Stromberg-Carlson put their switch (lab-prototype)into service in July 1977 in Richmond Hill, Georgia. This switch was SC's [...] "REA FIELD TRIAL" [...] office, but was never accepted by the telephone company (Coastal Utilities Inc) and was replaced with a Northern Telecom DMS-10 in the early 80's.|$|R
50|$|Each {{telephone}} company (local exchange carrier, or LEC) {{has at least}} two redundant DS0-level (that is, 64 kbit/s, or voice quality) trunks connecting each host <b>office</b> telephone <b>switch</b> to each call center. These trunks are either directly connected to the center or they are connected to a {{telephone company}} central switch that intelligently distributes calls to the PSAPs. These special switches are often known as 911 Selective Routers. Their use is becoming increasingly more common as it simplifies the interconnection between newer ISUP/SS7-based host <b>office</b> <b>switches</b> and the many older PSAP systems.|$|R
50|$|Whitehorse {{converted}} from partial dial to full dial service on October 31, 1960. After this date, local communities' ring-down phones were replaced with local exchange service, using surplus central <b>office</b> <b>switches</b> {{that could be}} acquired at a relatively low cost. The wire line facilities along the highway was changed from ring-down services to multi-party lines off dial exchanges as the communities along the line received central <b>office</b> <b>switches,</b> {{most of which were}} Ericsson Rurax switches that during the late 1970s were modified to enable direct dialing of long distance calls, though without automatic number identification. The more remote multi-party lines were switched from wire to Exicom radios, while the Ruraxes were mostly replaced in the mid-1980s with modern solid-state digital switches, though the last Rurax remained in service in Swift River until 1987.|$|R
50|$|The SP-1 {{design was}} {{superseded}} by the DMS-100 central <b>office</b> <b>switch</b> {{and other members}} of the DMS family of products (DMS: digital multiplex switch). DMS extended the technology by fully integrating switching and transmission. This was a major advance that changed the way systems were built.|$|E
50|$|The 1AESS central <b>office</b> <b>switch</b> {{incorporated}} higher processing capacities {{based on}} the 1A Processor in 1976. It was a plug compatible upgrade with a faster processor that incorporated the existing instruction set for programming compatibility, and used smaller remreed switches, fewer relays, and featured disk storage.|$|E

NBOC is the Network Build Out Capacitor, which is set to the average shunt capacitance through the telephone central <b>office</b> <b>switch.</b> Red arrows show relative current flow.|$|E
50|$|With Bell System divestiture, {{the network}} in the US was divided into local access and {{transport}} areas (LATAs). Calls within LATAs were carried by Local Exchange Carriers (LECs), while calls between them were carried by interexchange carriers (IXCs). LATAs generally have one or more tandem switches which interconnect end <b>office</b> <b>switches.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{movie is}} noted for the {{physical}} tracing of the call to find Inga (Bancroft) before she dies. Throughout the movie, the call is traced by hand through several electro-mechanical telephone central <b>office</b> <b>switches</b> {{which leads to the}} hotel where Inga was staying (originally the Hyatt House, now demolished) near the Seattle-Tacoma Airport.|$|R
50|$|However, in 2007, the US Air Force FPASS <b>office</b> <b>switched</b> all {{of their}} UAV systems over to the RQ-11 Raven B. Desert Hawk did make the short-list for the recent Netherlands Army Mini-UAV program, but {{ultimately}} lost to the RQ-11B Raven B. The only military forces still using Desert Hawk are the UK Army.|$|R
50|$|During {{heavy use}} periods, {{it could be}} {{difficult}} to converse in a central <b>office</b> <b>switch</b> room due to the clatter of calls being processed in a large switch. For example, on Mother's Day in the US, or on a Friday evening around 5pm, the metallic rattling could make raised voices necessary. For wire spring relaymarkers these noises resembled hail falling on a metallic roof.|$|E
50|$|The TSPS system {{utilized}} special analog trunks {{that originated}} at Class 5 end office circuit switch systems and Class 4 toll access circuit switch systems that {{were connected to}} Class 3 primary toll circuit switch systems such as the 4A-ETS/PBC and 4ESS switch systems. The TSPS system did not perform switching between the originating end <b>office</b> <b>switch</b> and the toll switch for the subscriber voice path.|$|E
50|$|In 1990 Siemens {{purchased}} Stromberg Carlson {{and moved}} its EWSD production to the Lake Mary, Florida production facility in 1991. In {{the next few}} years Siemens slowly phased out the DCO as a line side central <b>office</b> <b>switch.</b> The DCO-CS was continued through the 1990s to support regional LD companies. The DCO-CS was small on port capacity (just under 10,000), but was robust on features, more than most other carrier switches.|$|E
50|$|The new company, Siemens Stromberg-Carlson, {{became the}} third largest vendor of central <b>office</b> <b>switches</b> in the United States—with a {{combined}} installed base of 5 million access lines. They continued to manufacture the Siemens DCO {{as well as the}} Siemens EWSD out of the Lake Mary facility, moving production of the EWSD from New York to Florida.|$|R
50|$|In {{telephone}} switches, time-slot interchange switches usually {{form the}} outer {{layer of the}} switching fabric at a central <b>office's</b> <b>switch.</b> They take data from time-multiplexed T-1 or E-1 lines that serve neighborhoods. The T-1 or E-1 lines serve the subscriber line interface cards (SLICs) in local neighborhoods. The SLICs serve as the outer space-division switches of a modern wired telephone system.|$|R
50|$|The central <b>office</b> <b>switching</b> {{equipment}} has a two-motion stepping switch. A {{contact arm}} is {{moved up to}} select one of ten rows of contacts, and then rotated clockwise to select one of ten contacts in that row, a total of 100 choices. The stepping motion {{is controlled by the}} current pulses coming from the originating customer's telegraph keys, and later from the rotary dial.|$|R
50|$|The pair {{of wires}} {{from the central}} <b>office</b> <b>switch</b> to a {{subscriber}}'s home is called a subscriber loop. It carries a direct current (DC) voltage at a nominal voltage of 48V when the receiver is on-hook, supplied by a power conversion system in the central office. This power conversion system is backed up with a bank of batteries, resulting in continuation of service during interruption of power to the customer supplied by their electrical utility.|$|E

5000|$|... 56 kbit/s DS0 {{channels}} {{are associated with}} digital data service (DDS) services typically do not utilize the eighth bit of the DS0 as voice circuits that employ A&B out of band signaling. One exception is Switched 56kbit/s DDS. In DDS, bit eight is used to identify DTE request to send (RTS) condition. With Switched 56 DDS, bit eight is pulsed (alternately set to logical ZERO and ONE) to transmit two state dial pulse signaling information between a SW56 DDS CSU/DSU, and a digital end <b>office</b> <b>switch.</b>|$|E
