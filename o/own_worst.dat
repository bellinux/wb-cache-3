For this and other reasons, Waters' books are frequently compared to stories by Charles Dickens; the reader follows Nan's movement from sheltered naif to exuberant theatre performer to rent-boy to mistress to housewife then socialist orator, showing allegiance to none of these professions or ideals. Michael Upchurch in The Seattle Times writes that Nan's inability or unwillingness to adhere to any profession or setting, remaining malleable {{until the end of}} the novel indicates she is her <b>own</b> <b>worst</b> enemy.

25|$|The 2014–15 {{season was}} Arsenal's 23rd {{season in the}} Premier League and 95th {{consecutive}} season in the top flight of English football. This season Arsenal participated in the Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup, Community Shield and the UEFA Champions League. An inconsistent start to the league season ended any realistic hopes for the Premier League title as Arsenal only won two out of their first eight games. Inconsistency plagued Arsenal throughout {{the first half of}} the campaign, not helped by numerous injuries to important players. At one stage, Arsenal were as low as eighth heading into early December. This would later haunt them as they mounted a superb recovery during the second half of the season where they won eight league games in a row, becoming the in-form side of the division. Ultimately, however, the gap between themselves and leaders Chelsea was too much, the points dropped during the inconsistent first half of the season proving too much to recover. Old habits were hard to eradicate in Europe as yet again, Arsenal were their <b>own</b> <b>worst</b> enemies. Despite being widely expected to reach the quarter-finals, having been given a favourable draw in the Round of 16 against AS Monaco, Arsenal self-destructed at home, where panic led to Monaco winning the first leg 1–3, a scoreline which ultimately proved fatal over the course of the tie. Arsenal, with their 0–2 away win proving useless, bowed out yet again in the round of sixteen for the fifth consecutive year. However, Arsenal reclaimed the FA Cup, thus becoming the most successful club in the history of the competition with twelve wins, comfortably beating Aston Villa 4–0 in the final. Arsenal finished the league season in third, thereby qualifying directly to Champions league group stage and avoiding the Champions League qualifier, something Arsène Wenger was keen to avoid as he felt it had a negative impact on competing for the Premier League title, which was the primary target set by the players, manager and coaching staff, going into the next season.|$|E

He concludes that [...] "some people never reconcile themselves to such a loss at an early age, Madonna is not different than them." [...] Conversely, author Lucy O'Brien feels the impact of the rape she suffered is, in fact, the motivating factor behind everything Madonna has done, more important even than the death of her mother: [...] "It's not so much grief at her mother's death that drives her, as the sense of abandonment that left her unprotected.

In time these feelings turned to bitterness and vengeance towards those who criticized or doubted him, and led him to become notoriously bombastic and combative, often aggrandizing his accomplishments and fiercely denouncing critics (such as the wild exaggerations as to the success of the Oruktor Amphibolos at the end of his life). While his relentless pursuit of patent rights did indeed force people to pay him his due, the process badly damaged his reputation and made him many enemies.

He then appeared in small television roles on The Bernie Mac Show, My Wife and Kids, and Summerland. Lautner then earned voice-over roles in animated series such as Danny Phantom, Duck Dodgers, and What's New, Scooby-Doo?. The same year, he earned his first breakout role, starring in the film, The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D. Lautner spent three months on location in Austin, Texas, to film the movie, which was received with negative reviews from critics, and was a minor international success. However, Lautner was nominated at the 2006 Young Artist Awards for Best Performance in a Feature Film by a Leading Actor. For the film, Lautner choreographed all of his fight scenes after director Robert Rodríguez learned of his extensive martial arts training.

500|$|Adams is {{generally}} {{less well known}} than many of America's other founding fathers. McCullough argued that [...] "he problem with Adams is that most Americans know nothing about him." [...] Todd Leopold of CNN added in 2001 that Adams is [...] "remembered as that guy who served a single term as president between Washington and Jefferson, and as a short, vain, somewhat rotund man whose stature {{seems to have been}} dwarfed by his lanky colleagues." [...] He has always been seen, Ferling says, as [...] "honest and dedicated," [...] but despite his lengthy career in public service, is still overshadowed by the dramatic explanations and strong personalities of his contemporaries. Gilbert Chinard, in his 1933 biography of Adams, described the man as [...] "staunch, honest stubborn and somewhat narrow." [...] In his 1962 biography, Page Smith lauds Adams for his fight against radicals such as Thomas Paine, whose promised reforms portended anarchy and misery. In 1995, Peter Shaw published The Character of John Adams. Ferling says that the man who emerges is one [...] "perpetually at war with himself," [...] whose desire for fame and recognition leads to changes of vanity. Ferling, in his 1992 biography, writes that [...] "Adams was his <b>own</b> <b>worst</b> enemy." [...] He criticizes Adams for his [...] "pettiness...jealousy, and vanity," [...] and finds fault with him for his frequent separations from his wife and children. However, he praises Adams for his willingness to acknowledge his deficiencies and for striving to overcome them. In 2001, David McCullough published a biography of the president entitled John Adams. McCullough lauds Adams for consistency and honesty, [...] "plays down or explains away" [...] his more controversial actions, such as the dispute over presidential titles and the predawn flight from the White House, and criticizes his friend and rival, Jefferson. The book was very favorably received and, along with other biographies published not long before, contributed to a rapid surge in Adams' reputation.|$|E

500|$|Although often a {{candidate}} in the press to captain England, Fender was never chosen to do so. Rumours circulated at the time about the reasons. One suggestion {{was that he was}} overlooked because he was Jewish, but Fender said he was not Jewish and in any case did not believe this would have been a problem. Other purported reasons included that he had not been to Oxford or Cambridge, and {{that he was in the}} wine trade, which was considered an unsuitable career for a gentleman, but in later life Fender dismissed these as potential factors. In fact, not everyone approved of Fender's captaincy. He was sometimes accused of gamesmanship, for example by persuading umpires that conditions were unfit for play until they favoured his team. He occasionally used negative tactics when he was unhappy with the approach of the opposition—in one game where the opposition had not declared, he slowed down play to the extent that one over took 12 minutes to bowl. Opponents recalled other uses of time-wasting tactics, deliberate damaging of the pitch by Surrey players to assist their bowlers, and intimidation of both the opposition and umpires. The cricket writer Martin Williamson suggests that [...] "in an era where gentlemen played by the rules, Fender was adroit at stretching the Laws to snapping point." [...] Fender's attitude towards amateurs also brought him into opposition with others. His disinclination to play amateurs in the Surrey team unless they were talented enough was opposed by the Surrey committee—the Surrey president, H. D. G. Leveson Gower, wished Fender to include friends and contacts whom Fender did not consider worth a place in the team. According to E. W. Swanton: [...] "While always highly popular with the teams he led, his relations with the Surrey authorities were also apt to be difficult." [...] Fender attempted to unite the amateurs and professionals in the team through using one gate to enter the field, and stopped the practice of separate lunches and teas. He planned to end the tradition of using separate changing rooms, until stopped by the professional Hobbs. Fender's proposals shocked senior cricket figures, and caused another clash with the influential Lord Harris; allied to other disagreements between the pair, it may have ended his England career. The deeply conservative cricket establishment may also have resented Fender's unorthodoxy on the cricket pitch. Fender made himself more unacceptable by mocking establishment figures such as Leveson Gower; a teammate later remarked that Fender [...] "was often his <b>own</b> <b>worst</b> enemy". Fender also believed that the controversy over his journalism in 1921 counted against him with the MCC committee. According to Wisden, Fender's limited success at Test level [...] "may have saved the selectors, who were thought never to favour him as a captain of England, an embarrassing problem". His Wisden obituary concluded: [...] "He was one of the most colourful figures in the cricket world for many years... and was widely regarded as the shrewdest county captain of his generation".|$|E
