50|$|<b>Opinio</b> <b>juris</b> sive necessitatis ("an {{opinion of}} law or necessity") or simply <b>opinio</b> <b>juris</b> ("an opinion of law") {{is the belief}} that an action was carried out as a legal obligation. This is in {{contrast}} to an action resulting from cognitive reaction or behaviors habitual to an individual. This term is frequently used in legal proceedings such as a defense for a case.|$|E
5000|$|In {{international}} law, <b>opinio</b> <b>juris</b> is {{the subjective}} element used {{to judge whether}} the practice of a state {{is due to a}} belief that it is legally obliged to do a particular act. When <b>opinio</b> <b>juris</b> exists and is consistent with nearly all state practice, customary international law emerges. <b>Opinio</b> <b>juris</b> essentially means that states must act in compliance with the norm not merely out of convenience, habit, coincidence, or political expediency, but rather {{out of a sense of}} legal obligation. 1 Article 38(1)(b) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice accepts [...] "international custom" [...] as a source of law, but only where this custom is 1) “evidence of a general practice,” (the objective component) (2) [...] "accepted as law." [...] (the <b>opinio</b> <b>juris</b> or subjective component) [...] Thus, for example, while it may be observed that heads of state virtually always shake hands when they first meet, it is highly unlikely that they do so because they believe that a rule of international law requires it. On the other hand, a state would almost certainly expect some form of legal repercussions if it were to prosecute a foreign ambassador without the consent of his or her home state, and in this sense <b>opinio</b> <b>juris</b> does exist for the international law rule of diplomatic immunity.|$|E

5000|$|Customary {{international}} law, like {{international treaty}} law, {{is recognized as}} a primary source of public international law. While international treaties are written agreements by which States establish certain rules, customary international law consists of unwritten rules which derive from “general practice accepted as law”. [...] Therefore, for a rule of international custom to be established, two elements are required: “an objective one, the repeated behaviour of States ... and a subjective one, the belief that such behaviour depends on a legal obligation (<b>opinio</b> <b>juris</b> sive necessitatis)”. The objective element is also {{often referred to as}} State practice; the subjective element as <b>opinio</b> <b>juris.</b>|$|E
50|$|The two {{essential}} elements of customary international law are state practice and <b>opinio</b> <b>juris,</b> as confirmed by the International Court of Justice in the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons.|$|E
50|$|An {{evolution}} of the positivist approach of Grotius, the concept of consent {{is an element of}} customary international law. Customary international law is essentially what states actually do, plus the <b>opinio</b> <b>juris</b> of what states believe international law requires them to do.|$|E
5000|$|Because <b>opinio</b> <b>juris</b> {{refers to}} the {{psychological}} {{state of the state}} actor—asking why the state behaved as it did—it can be difficult to identify and to prove. In practice, a variety of sources tend to be used to demonstrate the existence of <b>opinio</b> <b>juris,</b> including evidence such as diplomatic correspondence, press releases and other government statements of policy, opinions of legal advisers, official manuals on legal questions, legislation, national and international judicial decisions, legal briefs endorsed by the state, a pattern of treaties ratified by the state that all include the same obligation(s), resolutions and declarations by the United Nations, and other sources. In the Paquete Habana case (decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1900 {{on the question of whether}} small coastal fishing boats are immune from capture during wartime under customary international law), evidence of <b>opinio</b> <b>juris</b> included medieval English royal ordinances, agreements between European nations, orders issued to the U.S. Navy in earlier conflicts, and the opinions of legal treatise writers. Finally, the context, circumstances, and manner in which the state practice is carried out can also be used to infer the existence of <b>opinio</b> <b>juris.</b> As the ICJ stated in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases of 1969, [...] "Not only must the acts concerned amount to a settled practice, but they must also be such, or be carried out in such a way, as to be evidence of a belief that this practice is rendered obligatory by the existence of a rule of law requiring it." [...] Nonetheless, a state's motives can change over time, and that it is not necessary that <b>opinio</b> <b>juris</b> be a significant impetus for each instance of action. As Judge Lachs wrote in a dissenting opinion in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases, [...] "At successive stages in the development of the customary rule the motives which have prompted States to accept it have varied from case to case. It could not be otherwise. At all events, to postulate that all States, even those which initiate a given practice, believe themselves to be acting under a legal obligation is to resort to a fiction, and in fact to deny the possibility of developing such rules." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Opinio</b> <b>juris</b> is the {{subjective}} element of custom {{as a source}} of law, both domestic and international, as it refers to beliefs. The other element is state practice, which is more objective as it is readily discernible. To qualify as state practice, the acts must be consistent and general international practice.|$|E
5000|$|A {{wealth of}} state {{practice}} does not usually carry {{with it a}} presumption that <b>opinio</b> <b>juris</b> exists. “Not only must the acts concerned amount to a settled practice, but they must also be such, or be carried out in such a way, as to be evidence of a belief that this practice is rendered obligatory by {{the existence of a}} rule of law requiring it.” ...|$|E
50|$|Ultimately, {{the court}} {{was unable to find}} an <b>opinio</b> <b>juris</b> (that is, legal consensus) that nuclear weapons are illegal to possess.

50|$|A {{situation}} where <b>opinio</b> <b>juris</b> would be feasible {{is a case}} concerning self-defense.

The act of striking an attacker may be done with legal justification; however, legal territory limits the acceptability of such a claim.

The States concerned must therefore feel that they are conforming to what amounts to a legal obligation.".

5000|$|There is {{a limited}} right of pre-emptive {{self-defence}} under customary law. Its continuing permissibility under the Charter hinges on the interpretation of article 51.

However, few observers really think that a state must wait for an armed attack to actually begin before taking action. A distinction can be drawn between [...] "preventive" [...] self-defence, which takes place when an attack is merely possible or foreseeable, and a permitted [...] "interventionary" [...] or [...] "anticipatory" [...] self-defence, which takes place when an armed attack is imminent and inevitable.

Judgments of international tribunals as well as scholarly works have traditionally been looked to as persuasive sources for custom in addition to direct evidence of state behavior. Attempts to codify customary international law picked up momentum after the Second World War with the formation of the International Law Commission (ILC), {{under the aegis of the}} United Nations. Codified customary law is made the binding interpretation of the underlying custom by agreement through treaty. For states not party to such treaties, the work of the ILC may still be accepted as custom applying to those states. General principles of law are those commonly recognized by the major legal systems of the world. Certain norms of international law achieve the binding force of peremptory norms (jus cogens) as to include all states with no permissible derogations.|$|E
5000|$|State {{practice}} and {{customary international law}} is that ships of all states have a right of innocent passage through territorial seas. That Egypt had consistently granted passage {{as a matter of}} state practice until then suggests that its <b>opinio</b> <b>juris</b> in that regard was consistent with practice. Moreover, during the Egyptian occupation of the Saudi islands of Sanafir and Tiran in 1950, it provided assurances to the US that the military occupation would not be used to prevent free passage, and that Egypt recognizes that such free passage is [...] "in conformity with the international {{practice and}} the recognized principles of international law.". In 1949 the International Court of Justice held in the Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v. Albania) that where a strait was overlapped by a territorial sea foreign ships, including warships, had unsuspendable right of innocent passage through such straits used for international navigation between parts of the high seas, but express provision for innocent passage through straits within the territorial sea of a foreign state was not codified until the 1958 Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone.|$|E
5000|$|As {{difficult}} {{as it can be}} to prove why an actor did act in a certain way, it is exponentially more difficult to prove why it did not act. For this reason, the necessity of demonstrating that a behavior was prompted by a sense of legal obligation makes it particularly difficult for customary international law to develop around the prohibition of a practice. One important case in the development of modern customary international law theory is the Lotus case, in which France attempted to protest Turkey's assertion of criminal jurisdiction over a French citizen for acts committed on the high seas (outside of Turkey's territory). France presented a number of historical examples to demonstrate that the state of nationality or the state whose flag the ship had flown had exclusive jurisdiction in cases such as this. However, the Permanent Court of International Justice (a precursor to the ICJ) declared that the evidence showed merely that [...] "States had often, in practice, abstained from instituting criminal proceedings, and not that they recognized themselves as being obliged to do so; for only if such abstention were based on their being conscious of having a duty to abstain would it be possible to speak of an international custom." [...] This reasoning was cited approvingly in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases, which similarly declined to find the existence of customary law regarding the proper method to delimit territorial claims to the continental shelf extending from the coastline of states bordering the North Sea. [...] The ICJ also declined to find evidence of customary international law in an opinion on the legality of the use or threat of nuclear weapons, despite what some argued to be uniform state practice. As in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases, it found that the mere fact that no state had used nuclear weapons against another state since World War II did not reflect <b>opinio</b> <b>juris.</b> Some states had pointed out that a series of U.N. resolutions had been issued [...] "that deal with nuclear weapons and that affirm, with consistent regularity, the illegality of nuclear weapons," [...] and argued that this signified “the existence of a rule of international customary law which prohibits recourse to those weapons.” [...] Nonetheless, the ICJ wrote that states possessing nuclear weapons had almost always objected to these resolutions, which strongly suggests that those states did not believe that a customary law prohibiting their use existed. Moreover, it wrote that the non-use of nuclear weapons could actually provide evidence of their [...] "use" [...] as a deterrent force.|$|E

40|$|The {{current state}} of {{international}} law is one of deep confusion {{over the role of}} state practice and <b>opinio</b> <b>juris</b> within the customary element. The debate between adherents of “modern custom” versus those of “traditional custom” has resulted in deep uncertainty and confusion. New theories of customary international law have proved inadequate in clarifying the {{current state of}} the field. Confusions over the meanings and relationships between state practice and <b>opinio</b> <b>juris</b> aside, current approaches are all also flawed due to a heavily state-centric bias that fails to take into account the very real affects that norm-generating transnational actors have on the international system. “Conceptual stretching” is an idea coined by the social scientist Giovanni Sartori to describe the distortions that result when established concepts are introduced to new cases without the required accompanying adaption. This idea is important to the discussion because the current conceptualization of customary international law, relying as it does on the dual attributes of state practice and <b>opinio</b> <b>juris,</b> is “conceptually stretched. ” Utilizing Sartori’s “ladder of abstraction,” a new framework for studying customary international norms can be utilized, one which looks to general theories of norm formation instead of focusing on customary international law and its dual attributes of state practice and <b>opinio</b> <b>juris.</b> In pursuing this line of inquiry, the idea of “legal recursivity” is especially promising and can be seen as a more apt description of how, in a new international system dominated by norm-generating transnational actors, international norms develop and operate.

40|$|The use of {{the terms}} “traditional” and “modern” to {{describe}} alternative interpretations of customary international law is recent. Nevertheless, the viewpoints attached to them and the debates they have engendered have existed {{for at least the}} past forty years. The emergence of these two alternative interpretations of customary international law has generated much debate within the field. Both “traditional” and “modern” custom have very different interpretations of the role state practice and <b>opinio</b> <b>juris</b> play in the formation of customary international law. This has resulted in confusion over what the precise meanings of these two components of customary international law actually are. Could part of the explanation for the emergence of these two radically different takes lie in the idea that both state practice and <b>opinio</b> <b>juris</b> are increasingly proving inadequate in explaining the process of international norm formation? The growth of international criminal tribunals has resulted in a degree of institutionalized and hierarchical norms that have had no historical precedent in the international system. Although these international criminal tribunals were designed as self-contained legal regimes, their jurisprudence has, nevertheless, begun to be elevated into norms of customary international law. Couple this phenomenon with the increasing rise and influence of transnational actors within the international system, and a complex picture of actors and institutions emerges where the old formula of state practice and <b>opinio</b> <b>juris</b> no longer describes the reality of the situation.

Traditionally, the formation of customary international law is constituted of two elements, state practice and <b>opinio</b> <b>juris,</b> in other words, the action of states and the subjective belief that the action is required by law. On occasions, however, the rules labelled under customary international law are not found through the process of establishing state practice and <b>opinio</b> <b>juris,</b> but stem from other normative considerations, as the case-study of international criminal tribunals illustrates. This thesis examines the nature of customary international law and the ‘modernised’ version of it; what distinguishes the traditional and novel concepts; where do they arise from - the process of their formation; and their relationship with other sources of international law. The critical analysis concentrates on this transformed process of discovering rules categorised as customary international law, and the impact of this novel process on the {{understanding of the nature of}} customary international law, as well as on the legitimacy of the resulting rules. The thesis does not, finally, purport to renounce the expansion of {{the sources of}} international law, but rather directs the criticism on the methods of finding customary international law and the compliance to the principle of legality, and notes that criminal trials may not be the appropriate venues for the discovery of novel sources of law or the explicit extension of the scope of existing sources...|$|E
40|$|The {{freedom of}} space exploration, {{including}} {{the ability to}} conduct remote sensing activities, is widely accepted by states. The general principles {{set out in the}} Outer Space Treaty and the Moon Agreement were refined in various United Nations General Assembly Resolutions, including the Remote Sensing Principles (RSP) of 1986. Although the RSP support the basic tenets of the outer space treaties and refers to the provision of access to remote sensing data on non-discriminatory terms, the principles are drafted in general terms and fail to provide direction with regard to issues such as the refusal by states to provide access to remote sensing data. Notwithstanding the fact that the RSP makes no provision for such an exception, various states have included provisions in their national legislation allowing for the refusal of access to high resolution remote sensing data for national security reasons. In order to evaluate whether there is an existing or new rule of customary international law allowing for the refusal of access to remote sensing data on this basis, the state practice and <b>opinio</b> <b>juris</b> of specially affected states were examined. It was found that the conduct of states in this regard constitutes voluntary repeated action for the sake of convenience and is not based on a belief that such conduct is required by a certain rule of law. Accordingly, this study did not find evidence of the requisite state practice and <b>opinio</b> <b>juris</b> to support an existing or new rule of customary international law allowing for the refusal of high resolution remote sensing data for national security reasons. It is argued, however, that this study supports possible emerging state practice in this regard. The terrorist attacks of 9 / 11 was a Grotian moment and resulted in a fundamental change in the concept of national security and what constitutes a threat to national security. The study shows that states predominantly refer to the threat of terrorism when discussing issues of national security. States are concerned that high resolution remote sensing data can be used for terrorist activities, as this imagery can reveal the precise location of roads, buildings and military structures and allow for more precise weapons delivery. Accordingly, it is submitted that the above events have {{paved the way for the}} accelerated development of a new rule of customary international law, namely for states to reserve the right to refuse access to high resolution remote sensing data for national security reasons such as terrorist threats. Customary international law must have the ability to evolve and respond to new developments. Increasing state conduct in this regard points to emerging state practice which may in future be supported by the requisite <b>opinio</b> <b>juris</b> to create a new rule of customary international law.

In these areas of law and others, they are no longer “subsidiary” sources as that word is used in the International Court of Justice Statute, Art. 38. In the same fields of customary international law, other binding acts of international organizations, such as the UN Security Council, are also used as practice, and the statements of these organizations are used as <b>opinio</b> <b>juris.</b> Where judicial and quasi-judicial {{decisions of}} international organizations are acts of treaty interpretation and application, these acts are instances of subsequent practice. In some cases, judicial decisions play a role similar to the subsequent acts of states parties to the treaties in the Vienna Convention of the Law of Treaties.

Individuals, particularly those accused of crime, can make direct claims of right under international law to these courts and tribunals.

The expanding role of international organizations, including the international judiciary, in the process of making international law is being led by the ICC and other international criminal tribunals. It is already spreading to other areas of the law, such as international trade law. This growth is likely to continue.
