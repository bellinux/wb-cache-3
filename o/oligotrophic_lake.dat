25|$|Lake Superior {{has fewer}} {{dissolved}} nutrients relative to its water volume {{than the other}} Great Lakes and so is less productive in terms of fish populations and is an <b>oligotrophic</b> <b>lake.</b> This {{is a result of}} the underdeveloped soils found in its relatively small watershed. However, nitrate concentrations in the lake have been continuously rising for more than a century. They are still much lower than levels considered dangerous to human health; but this steady, long-term rise is an unusual record of environmental nitrogen buildup. It may relate to anthropogenic alternations to the regional nitrogen cycle, but researchers are still unsure of the causes of this change to the lake's ecology.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{occurrence}} of preimaginal stages of Diptera (excluding Chironomidae and Simuliidae) in the Tatra Mountain lakes, their inlets and outlets, {{and the influence}} of acidification on the presence of these taxa were assessed. At 21 sites, 18 Diptera taxa were recorded in 2000 and 2001. The most frequent were Dicranota sp. (73 %), Pedicia (C.) rivosa (50 %) andWiedemannia sp. (14 %). Diptera were ordinated by RDA; relationships between taxa and environmental variables were significantly determined by temperature and habitat characteristics (altitude, habitat, alkalinity, Ca 2 +, pH, temperature, conductivity). The RDA diagram confirmed the existence of four Diptera assemblage groups corresponding with four habitat types. Group 1 – alpine and subalpine <b>oligotrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> at higher altitudes threatened by acidification, with the acid tolerant taxa Tipula rufina, T. alpium, Dicranota sp. and Rhypholophus sp. Group 2 – subalpine <b>oligotrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> not threatened by acidification with the acid sensitive taxaWiedemannia sp., Hemerodromia sp., Tipula (S.) benesignata, Orimarga sp.,Chionea sp., Pedicia (C.) rivosa and Bazarella subneglecta which prefer higher temperature. Group 3 – subalpine <b>oligotrophic</b> <b>lakes,</b> with the acid sensitive speciesBerdeniella illiesi, which prefers cold water. Group 4 – outlets of submontane <b>oligotrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> with characteristic taxa Tricyphona sp. and Tipula goriziensis. Acidified alpine and subalpine Tatra lakes are situated mostly at higher altitudes (1705 – 2145 m a. s. l.) and have specific taxonomic composition...|$|R

40|$|Tourists can {{adversely}} {{influence the}} ecology of <b>oligotrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> by increasing algal production via direct nutrient inputs and/or re-suspension of sediments. To assess the influence of tourists on food web dynamics, we used the natural abundance of stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen to calculate {{the relative importance of}} autochthonous and allochthonous carbon sources to littoral zone food webs across five variously visited perched dune lakes on Fraser Island, Australia. The relative importance of autochthonous (phytoplankton and periphyton) carbon to littoral zone consumers was highly variable across taxa and lakes. Despite the potential influence of algal biomass, ambient nutrient concentrations and tannin concentrations on the contribution of autochthonous carbon to littoral zone food webs, none of these variables correlated to the per cent contribution of autochthonous carbon to consumer diets. Instead, autochthonous sources of carbon contributed more to the diets of aquatic consumers in heavily visited lakes than in less visited lakes, suggesting that tourist activities might drive these systems towards an increased reliance on autochthonous carbon. The assessment of the contribution of autochthonous carbon to littoral zone food webs may represent a more robust indicator of the impact of tourists in <b>oligotrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> than standard measures of nutrient concentrations and/or algal biomass.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{determine}} the relative importance of heterotrophy and autotrophy in lake plankton. Empirical analyses using extensive surveys of literature data revealed three specific patterns in metabolism and biomass structure in freshwater plankton. First, the ratio of phytoplankton production to plankton respiration (P/R ratio) tends to be low in unproductive lakes ($<$ 1), and increases along gradients of enrichment. Second, the contribution of planktonic heterotrophs (bacteria and zooplankton) to community respiration is highest in <b>oligotrophic</b> <b>lakes.</b> Third, planktonic heterotrophs dominate community biomass in <b>oligotrophic</b> <b>lakes,</b> whereas phytoplankton increasingly dominate plankton biomass along gradients of enrichment. These three distinct patterns were then tested simultaneously in a set of lakes that span a wide trophic gradient. Results indicated that the plankton of <b>oligotrophic</b> and mesotrophic <b>lakes</b> were characterized by P/R ratios well below unity, and a high contribution of heterotrophs to both community respiration and biomass. These trends are completely the opposite in the most productive lakes. The plankton communities of <b>oligotrophic</b> temperate <b>lakes</b> are predominantly heterotrophic and extensively utilize external inputs of carbon, and therefore only the plankton of eutrophic lakes conformed to the classical phytoplankton-based food web. In most lakes, excess heterotrophic activity could be supported by inputs of organic matter from the drainage basin. Excess plankton respiration, fueled by allochthonous organic carbon, could represent an important source of CO$ sb 2 $ to lakes...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that cases of diaptomid dominance in <b>oligotrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> are due to lower food requirements for Diaptomus species than Daphnia species. We test this hypothesis by competing Daphnia pulicaria and Diaptomus oregonensis populations in continuous and semicontinuous cultures. The threshold food concentrations for population growth of D. pulicaria and D. oregonensis were statistically indistinguishable. The thresholds of both species were {{within the range of}} concentrations characteristic of ultraoligotrophic lakes. The dominant species varied across experiments in a pattern consistent with an effect of temporal variation in food concentration. Neither our data nor previously published studies provide support for the hypothesis that cases of Diaptomus dominance in <b>oligotrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> are due to a simple difference in threshold food concentrations. The taxonomic composition of the zooplankton assem-blage has important implications for community and eco-system processes.
