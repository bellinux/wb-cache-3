5|$|Ef: The Latter Tale begins {{once again}} with Yuko Amamiya and Yu Himura {{in the middle of}} a reunion in a church during Christmas time. Yuko tells Yu how she has {{influenced}} people in two separate stories (from Ef: The First Tale). After she is done with this, she asks him to tell her about the people he has influenced. Yu starts to tell his first story, that of Chihiro Shindo; the third chapter begins. Like Yuko, Yu also abruptly appears <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>and</b> disappears just as mysteriously. He often gives advice and warnings to Renji and others. Yu is close to Chihiro and takes care of her. After the conclusion of the third chapter, the story goes back to Yuko and Yu with Yu ending his recount of the third chapter, and goes on to talk about how he and Yuko were separated in the past. Yu starts his recount of the events from the fourth chapter. At the end of the fourth chapter, the story shifts one final time back to Yuko and Yu. Up to this point the two have been recounting individual tales to each other. The meaning of the overall title Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two is revealed to be in connection with Yuko and Yu.|$|E
25|$|An Automaton C {{appeared}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>and</b> captured Leah. As Leah screams helplessly, Captain Barbell appears {{and saved}} her. Then he left {{telling her that}} {{he still needs to}} save Metro Manila with a big smile in his face.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Christabel {{gives birth}} to a baby boy. Her father is so angry that he swears to have her killed, so he puts her into a small boat with her new-born baby and they are set adrift without food or water, {{at the mercy of}} the winds and the currents, to share a fate that is {{suffered}} also by Emaré and by Geoffrey Chaucer’s heroine Constance in his Canterbury tale from the Man of Law. Soon they are driven onto a rock, and mother and baby go ashore to sit with the seagulls. A griffin appears from <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>and</b> carries the baby off.|$|E
50|$|A storm struck on {{the night}} Laura Shane was born, {{and there was a}} strangeness about the weather that people would {{remember}} for years. Even more mysterious was the blond-haired stranger who appeared <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> again <b>and</b> again to save Laura from tragedy.|$|R

25|$|As {{suddenly}} as they appeared, the tourists vanish. The fugitive {{returns to the}} museum to investigate and finds no evidence of people being there during his absence. He attributes the experience to a hallucination caused by food poisoning, but the tourists reappear that night. They have come <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>and</b> yet they talk {{as if they have}} been there for a while. He watches them closely while still avoiding direct contact and notices more strange things. In the aquarium he encounters identical copies of the dead fish he found on his day of arrival. During a day at the pool, he sees the tourists jump to shake off the cold when the heat is unbearable. The strangest thing he notices is the presence of two suns and two moons in the sky.|$|E
25|$|The Mongols {{also used}} {{deception}} {{very well in}} their wars. For instance, when approaching a mobile army the units would be split into three or more army groups, each trying to outflank and surprise their opponents. This created many battlefield scenarios for the opponents where the Mongols would seem to appear <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>and</b> there were seemingly more of them than in actuality. Flanking and/or feigned retreat if the enemy could not be handled easily {{was one of the}} most practiced techniques. Other techniques used commonly by the Mongols were completely psychological and were used to entice/lure enemies into vulnerable positions by showing themselves from a hill or some other predetermined locations, then disappearing into the woods or behind hills while the Mongols' flank troops already strategically positioned would appear as if out of nowhere from the left, right and/or from their rear. During the initial states of battlefield contact, while camping in close proximity of their enemies at night, they would feign numerical superiority by ordering each soldier to light at least five fires, which would appear to the enemy scouts and spies that their force was almost five times larger than it actually was.|$|E
500|$|... "Radio Bart" [...] {{was written}} by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza, though series creator Matt Groening {{came up with the}} idea for it. The episode was based on the 1951 film Ace in the Hole, which sees the story of a down-and-out journalist exploiting a story about a man trapped in a cave to re-jump start his career. Vitti did not watch the film until after the episode had been written; [...] " [...] came in <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>and</b> just gave me, start to finish, the whole story." [...] Vitti said renting the film was the first thing he did after finishing the script. He remarked, [...] "It's surprisingly hard to rent. It's really dark and funny and it's by Billy Wilder, so you think it would be in stores, but it's not. It was hard to find." ...|$|E

She {{appeared}} in the made-for-television movies Atomic Train, Crimes of Passion: Nobody Lives Forever, <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nowhere,</b> Christmas Lodge <b>and</b> Tears and Laughter: The Joan and Melissa Rivers Story.|$|R

5000|$|In 1981, Walsh next {{formed a}} four-piece <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nowhere</b> (Walsh, guitar/vocals, Gary Warner, soprano saxophone, Tony Forde, {{clarinet}} and Graeme Hutchinson, drums) and recorded [...] "The Arrangements" [...] a cassette-only release with Pink and Blue, a duet of artists Jenny Watson and John Nixon, then {{curator of the}} Institute of Modern Art. After a string of shows around Brisbane during their first year, the band relocated to Sydney in 1982, adding Joe Borkowski on bass and Jeffrey Wegener of the Laughing Clowns replacing Hutchinson on drums. This incarnation of the band recorded <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nowhere’s</b> first <b>and</b> only single for Ed Kuepper’s Prince Melon label [...] "No Resistance/Remember, Remember.".|$|R
500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Labrecque wrote [...] "the episode really {{finished}} strong with {{a fabulous}} Gladys Knight musical number". Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide also praised the musical number, saying [...] "that 'Midnight Train to Georgia' number {{at the end}} of tonight's episode... Wow. So <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>and</b> so fun." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad said that the episode [...] "was a good episode to go into the hiatus with, if that makes things better". He criticized the fact that the fictional TGS writing staff was not present in this episode, even though they could have been effectively used. Michael Neal of Television Without Pity awarded the episode a grading of A+. The Boston Globes Joanna Weiss reviewed the episode positively, saying [...] " [...] concluded with a musical interlude that was both hilarious and wistful".|$|E
500|$|John Calvert of The Quietus called [...] "Pyramids" [...] {{a little}} [...] "structurally {{ramshackle}} though never erratic, it's {{the type of}} massive album centrepiece that was inconceivable before The-Dream's stadium-R reinvented the genre as a mythological epic." [...] Paley Martin of Most Blunted stated that the track [...] "is {{so much more than}} a song; it is an audible baptism, a narrative delicacy, a self-indulgent experience! And you best believe once you press play, this ride will take you to the destination of your choice." [...] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard felt that the real triumph was Ocean's song structure: [...] "verses and hooks collapse onto each other, rhymes pop up <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere,</b> <b>and</b> the singer acts like minutely balancing a 10-minute concept piece is no big deal." [...] Chris Richards of The Washington Post Company described the track as a [...] "righteous funk opus that spans nearly 10 minutes", commented that it [...] "is loaded with metaphorical riddles, drawing parallels between Cleopatra and a 21st-century prostitute. Puzzle over it. Dance to it. All of the above." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of the album, a few tracks were made {{available}} for streaming via the band's Myspace: [...] "The Plot to Bomb the Panhandle", [...] "Fast Forward to 2012", [...] "The Danger in Starting a Fire", [...] "A Shot in the Dark" [...] and [...] "Show 'Em the Ropes". Cover art was unveiled on November 30, 2006. A commercial to promote the album was released on January 4, 2007. Pre-orders were taken starting January 16. The album was released in the US on January 22, while the UK release occurred a week later, on January 29. On March 8, the band released the music video for [...] "The Plot to Bomb the Panhandle", which featured Ron Jeremy. The video was filmed in Los Angeles. After being asked how they got Jeremy to appear, McKinnon said [...] "It was pretty much some that we were kicking around. We were kicking around different people and I think, Tony threw that out there, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>and</b> we were like 'That'd be cool, that'd be funny, people will be into that.'".|$|E
5000|$|In May 2014, {{two years}} after Smith was last seen, law {{enforcement}} officials declared Gavin Smith dead and a judge issued a death certificate. His date of death was declared {{to have been the}} night he disappeared. [...] "I think the idea of a person that goes missing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> is intriguing <b>and</b> tragic," [...] said a spokesman for the LACSD.|$|R
50|$|The CIA officer tells Jonathan to {{give them}} the photo film canister. At the Los Angeles {{headquarters}} of the CIA, Jonathan spots Sasha who looks like she was working there. Jonathan eventually meets up with Sasha. Sasha admits that she is Cheryl Brewster, a CIA agent, originally from Pittsburgh. <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere,</b> Vlad <b>and</b> his gang begin to chase Jonathan and Cheryl on the UCLA campus. Jonathan eliminates all the Soviets with a tranquilizer gun which he gets from the campus veterinary sciences building. The Soviets are arrested, the CIA agents thank Jonathan for his (indirect) help in obtaining the film, and Sasha tells him she wants to continue their relationship.|$|R
50|$|Superman later {{encounters}} Ultraman, Superwoman and Owlman after a {{scared and}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> control superpowered baby appears <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere.</b> Ultraman <b>and</b> Owlman {{come to believe}} the child is the offspring of Ultraman and Superwoman. Owlman wants to kill it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> jealousy, Ultraman wants to raise it as his demented protégé, and Superman tries to save it from them both. When Superwoman arrives on the scene, adamant that she has never given birth, it is revealed that the superpowered infant is actually a reborn Brainiac from the antimatter universe, defeated by Ultraman in the Earth-2 story. Brainiac's sentience is eventually disbursed and the villains return home to sort out their differences.|$|R
500|$|The {{mistranslation}} spawned {{rumors about}} the existence of a Sheng Long character in the game, and players sent letters to video game publications attempting to confirm the character's existence. In the April 1992 issue of the video game magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly, a method was [...] "revealed" [...] to reach Sheng Long in the arcade game. The reporter gave an [...] "Honorable Mention" [...] to [...] "W.A. Stokins" [...] ("waste tokens") of [...] "Fuldigen, HA" [...] ("fooled again, ha") and claimed that the character could be found if a player using Ryu did not let the character suffer any damage during the entire game, and upon reaching the final match against M. Bison could neither hit Bison nor let him inflict any damage until the time limit expired, thus ending the round in a draw. After repeating this for ten consecutive rounds Sheng Long would then appear <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>and</b> throw Bison off of the edge screen and out of the way. The game's on-screen timer would then stop at 99 seconds, resulting in a [...] "fight to the death" [...] between Ryu and Sheng Long.|$|E
500|$|... {{a mysterious}} girl {{dressed like a}} nun, and , a mysterious gentleman who is somehow {{attached}} to the church where Yuko first appears, are having a reunion in a church during Christmas time. Despite her attire, Yuko is not affiliated with the church. She always appears generally <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere,</b> <b>and</b> disappears just as quickly in various places throughout the story to talk with Hiro or other characters and give them advice. Yuko and Yu reminisce about the past and remember events {{of the previous year}} around the same time {{at the beginning of the}} first chapter of the story. Yuko hints of events that are revealed throughout Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two. After the conclusion of the first chapter, the story cycles back to the prologue and the talk between Yuko and Yu. Yuko ends with her talk about the events in the first chapter. At the end of the second chapter, the story shifts again to the scene with Yuko and Yu. Yuko finishes her talk on the events from the second chapter and says that she misses talking to Hiro, Kyosuke, and their friends. Their talk ends with allusions to the continuation of the story, Ef: The Latter Tale.|$|E
2500|$|Alice {{arrives and}} takes the wine, and sees through Annabel's offer almost immediately. With Annabel refusing to offer any more, Miriam, in {{apparent}} desperation, suggests Lewis could find the money. Alice scorns this too, and, before leaving {{to go to the}} Police, stops to tell Miriam has one hell of a sister ... but before she can finish, she collapses. Miriam says she drugged the wine (her own glass having come from a different bottle in the kitchen), and a horrified Annabel watches her push Alice's body through the trapdoor and down the well. Next, she goes through Alice's handbag looking for the letter. It is not there, but her address and keys are, so she persuades Annabel to come with her to get the letter. Before Annabel leaves, she takes one last look at the tennis court, a tennis ball flies <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere,</b> <b>and</b> she screams.|$|E

50|$|Although {{announced}} in the opening credits, {{this part of the}} film was never announced. Belov's death allowed Maks and Kaverin to come <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hiding. Seeing a final end to his lifelong rival, he and Artur engage in a joint business venture, and are examining a construction site that is soon to open as a new shopping centre. <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> Bely appears <b>and</b> kills Maks, Artur, a few of their fellow thugs and finally Kaverin himself. Afterwards he explains to Inshakov how he staged his own death and how the car was empty when it exploded and went over into the river.|$|R
2500|$|Swarming is {{advantageous}} to less powerful countries and groups, {{because it allows}} them to balance their disadvantage in firepower and numbers. Despite being less technically advanced, Communist forces made good use of swarming in Asia during the Cold War. The Chinese were able to make up for their lack of firepower by attacking from all sides and then quickly advancing to the rear. The Vietcong were famous from attacking from all directions <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>and</b> then quickly disappearing. When they did come into close contact, they used a technique called [...] "hugging the belt", which meant they were too close for the US to employ air and artillery support. If the attackers [...] "hugged" [...] at several points, [...] "pulsing" [...] their attacks, they both neutralized external fire support, but also made it difficult for the US commander to know where to commit reserves.|$|E
2500|$|... "I Said" [...] {{includes}} {{elements of}} EDM, and a fuzzy bass that [...] "dominate the song {{even more than}} his [...] repetitive chorus of “I said I said I said it's real / I said I said I said take the wheel / But you said you said you said no deal.”" [...] The song was described by Allmusic as a [...] "rubbery midtempo ballad that injects a smidgen of melancholy into the proceedings." [...] "Tonight" [...] has an instrumentation of a disco bass, and the drumbeat and bass of the song [...] "makes the song the most authentically danceable on the album," [...] according to Popmatters. [...] "I Wonder" [...] has a [...] "chopped and screwed beat and dancing piano lines" [...] that [...] "is club pop for the PBR set," [...] according to Paste Magazine. Lyrically, the song deals with getting older and [...] "staying put". [...] "Much Too Late" [...] is [...] "a rant that seems to come <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>and</b> doesn't fit in with anything else on this record," [...] as described by PopMatters. [...] "Ten Dollars I Found" [...] is the last track of the album, and was described by Popmatters as the only real ballad from the album.|$|E
2500|$|In the woods, David and Emma find Hyde, {{and this}} time he is ready as he overpowers them almost immediately, only to have Gold come <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>and</b> stabs him in the heart with the serum-covered dagger, but that fails as well, as Hyde tells Gold that he {{switched}} serums with Jekyll earlier, then takes the Dark One’s dagger and uses it to control Gold to [...] take him to Belle. When the two appeared in front of the Jolly Roger, Hyde says that there is one final twist. It turns out that that Jekyll is actually the ruthless one, as his aggressive behavior starts to worry Belle as she attempts to use the seashell to contact Hook but Jekyll breaks it, and her attempt to escape is prevented by the protection spell, and all Gold and Hyde can do is look on. Fortunately, Hook arrived just in time to save Belle by not only killing Jekyll, but also killing Hyde. Realizing that the same thing can happen because Jekyll and Hyde are still the same person, and therefore likewise with her and the Evil Queen, Regina ask Emma to [...] "do what is necessary" [...] to keep from returning to evil, while an angry Belle confronts Gold about his deal with Hyde. He reveals that, back when she was a slave in his castle, he was worried about the feelings he had for her. Gold sought out Jekyll to see if his serum could rid people of [...] "weakness," [...] but when his experiment failed, he angrily banished Hyde to the Land of Untold Stories. Belle is still distrustful with Gold, but he insists she will need him to protect their child, claiming that “necessity” will make her love him once again.|$|E

The horseman then blinds Takamaru with his last remaining arrow as the twenty men in yellow proceed to capture and behead him, mounting his head onto a spear.|$|R

They confront Doctor Eggman, who reveals his latest device: a camera which can turn {{people and things}} into cards, having already done so to Amy. He turns Tails into a card just as Knuckles arrives, angry at Eggman for using his device on the Master Emerald as well. Eggman announces his plan to conquer the world by turning {{everything}} to cards, challenging Sonic and Knuckles to stop him as he flees. The two heroes both set out independently to stop his plan. Elsewhere, Shadow receives a distress signal from Eggman, but upon finding him, the doctor denies sending one. He later receives a communication from Rouge warning him she has stumbled upon a dangerous secret about Eggman, but she is turned to a card before she can continue. Suddenly, Silver appears from the future, and tells Shadow {{he needs to get}} to Eggman first.|$|R
5000|$|Described as a [...] "surreal parable in {{song and}} dance" [...] by Williamson, U was [...] "neither a pageant, a play, dance, theater, nor pantomime, {{though there were}} {{elements}} of all of those" [...] in the show. For the plot, Williamson explained [...] "the vague notion was, a soul incarnates <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere,</b> lives, <b>and</b> then vanishes again at the other end. Hence the idea 'U'", although the performances themselves hardly followed a coherent storyline. On April 8, 1970, the three-hour U show opened at London's Roundhouse where it ran for ten consecutive days. As many as 12 dancers accompanied the band on stage; the dancing aspect was reminscent of the group's early performing days with the duo Mimi and Mouse. Another booking, this time for six days at the Fillmore West in San Francisco, came at the ISB's own expense, and the financial fallout forced the group to complete the shows without the Stone Monkey in a standard concert format.|$|R

He was just thinking sorrowfully, as he listened to the music, how like his own position was to that of the hero of Tennyson's Maud--a poem to which he was greatly addicted, when Mr Pickering's 'Hi!' came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>and</b> hit him like a torpedo.|$|E

5000|$|Along Army Group Centre's front, August 1943 {{saw this}} force pushed {{back from the}} Hagen line slowly, ceding {{comparatively}} little territory, but the loss of Bryansk, and more importantly Smolensk, on 25 September cost the Wehrmacht the keystone of the entire German defensive system. The 4th and 9th armies and 3rd Panzer Army still held their own east of the upper Dnieper, stifling Soviet attempts to reach Vitebsk. On Army Group North's front, there was barely any fighting at all until January 1944, when <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> Volkhov <b>and</b> Second Baltic Fronts struck. In a lightning campaign, the Germans were pushed back from Leningrad and Novgorod was captured by Soviet forces. After a 75-mile advance in January and February, the Leningrad Front had reached the borders of Estonia. To Stalin, the Baltic Sea seemed {{the quickest way to}} take the battles to the German territory in East Prussia and seize control of Finland. The Leningrad Front's offensives towards Tallinn, a main Baltic port, were stopped in February 1944. The German army group [...] "Narwa" [...] included Estonian conscripts, defending the re-establishment of Estonian independence.|$|R

Rockabilly re-dubbed himself [...] "Badd Ass" [...] Billy Gunn and Jesse James rechristened himself the Road Dogg. The team made an immediate impact on the WWF tag team scene with blatant attacks against other tag teams and, initially not having an entrance theme, walking out to the ring with only Road Dogg making a rant against their opponents over the PA system.
