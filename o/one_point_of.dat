5|$|This was but <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> {{difference}} between Oak Ridge residents {{and the rest}} of Anderson County. While most Oak Ridge residents had high school diplomas, and many had college degrees, the average education level of adults in Anderson County was only 6.8 years. Oak Ridge residents demanded, and Groves insisted on, schools with fine teachers and first-rate facilities. To achieve this, the Manhattan District paid teachers nearly twice as much as Anderson County. The consequent drain of qualified teachers from surrounding areas aroused considerable resentment.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{reviews of}} the title have been {{generally}} positive. Famitsu generally praised several aspects, but found the item management and weapon structures confusing, saying {{that it did not}} live up to the legacy of the Mana series. Reviewing the Vita port, Famitsu praised the game's general ease of play and use of the Mana series, but the button layout was criticized. Kyōsuke Takano of AppGet praised the gameplay and graphics, noting that the game avoided the possible pitfalls of being a mobile game while delivering a strong experience. His <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> reservation was that he would have preferred the game on another platform. 4Gamer.net praised the variety of control options, the feel of gameplay, and the graphics. The writer noted that the game should be played on more advanced mobiles despite recommendations, as the graphics and performance suffered on older smartphone models.|$|E

5|$|Moving from {{individual}} graphs to graph families, if {{a family of}} graphs has the property that every subgraph of a graph in the family {{is also in the}} family, and every graph in the family has at most as many edges as vertices, then the family contains only pseudoforests. For instance, every subgraph of a thrackle (a graph drawn so that every pair of edges has <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> intersection) is also a thrackle, so Conway's conjecture that every thrackle has at most as many edges as vertices can be restated as saying that every thrackle is a pseudoforest. A more precise characterization is that, if the conjecture is true, then the thrackles are exactly the pseudoforests with no four-vertex cycle and at most one odd cycle.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> {{concern has}} been the {{standard}} of radiation emission from 10,000 years to 1,000,000 years into the future. On August 9, 2005, the United States Environmental Protection Agency proposed a limit of 350millirem per year for that period. In October 2007, the DOE issued {{a draft of the}} Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement in which it shows that for the first 10,000years mean public dose would be 0.24mrem/year and that thereafter to 1,000,000 years the median public dose would be 0.98mrem/year, both of which are substantially below the proposed EPA limit. For comparison, a hip x-ray results in a dose around 83 mrem and a CT head or chest scan results in around 1,110 mrem. Annually, in the United States, an individual's doses from background radiation is about 350 mrem, although some places get more than twice that.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> {{criticism}} {{is that the}} film gives a misleading impression of the whereabouts and magnitude of Kony's remaining LRA forces. As of early 2012, Kony's followers were thought to number only in the hundreds, and Kony himself {{was believed to be}} in the Central African Republic rather than Uganda—a fact that receives only a passing mention in the video. This problem raised questions about the plausibility of Ugandan army intervention, which the video advocates. Since Kony and most of the LRA forces are currently not in Uganda, the Ugandan army would need to coordinate with the governments and militaries of the other countries where the LRA is active.|$|E

5|$|In {{his third}} year of junior, Hodgson was {{selected}} {{to compete in the}} 2009 World Junior Championships with Team Canada in Ottawa. He was chosen as an alternate captain to defenceman Thomas Hickey. In the second round-robin game against Kazakhstan, Hodgson accumulated six points (two goals and four assists), coming within <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the single-game Canadian record held by Michael Cammalleri and Dave Andreychuk. In the following round-robin game against the United States, he scored the game-winning goal in a 7–4 win to lead Team Canada to first place in their pool and a bye to the semi-finals. Facing Sweden in the final game, Hodgson scored two goals – one on the powerplay and an empty-netter – and one assist to overtake John Tavares as the tournament leading scorer with five goals and 11 assists for 16 points in six games. Team Canada defeated Sweden 5–1 to capture the gold medal while Hodgson was named to the Tournament All-Star Team. Returning from the tournament, Hodgson was asked to drop the ceremonial faceoff for a Toronto Maple Leafs game against the Florida Panthers on January 6, 2009.|$|E
5|$|Indonesia is {{the largest}} {{aviation}} market in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). However, Indonesia {{is not yet a}} full member of the ASEAN open sky agreement, which plans to lift regional flying restrictions throughout Southeast Asia on member country airlines by the end of 2015 or early 2016. Indonesia is considering opening up only five of its international airports under this policy; they are Jakarta, Medan, Bali, Surabaya and Makassar. To date, Indonesia has agreed to open access to Jakarta, yet, Indonesia remains opposed to opening up its secondary cities. Currently Indonesia adopt limitations for foreign airlines to operate in Indonesia. This rather protectionist stance was meant to protect Indonesian aviation business against competitors, particularly from Singapore and Malaysia. Basically, this stance is stemmed from a systematic imbalance between ASEAN nations; as a large nation, Indonesia is able to offer hundreds of access points, while other fellow ASEAN members may offer far less points of access. Singapore for example has only <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> access, while Malaysia may offer two or three access points. This systematic imbalance for exchange of traffic rights has led Indonesian carriers to lobby their government to refrain from entering into multilateral agreement on ASEAN Single Aviation Market.|$|E
5|$|Linden {{made his}} NHL debut on October 6, 1988 against the Winnipeg Jets, aged 18. He scored his first goal on October 18, 1988, against Kelly Hrudey of the New York Islanders and later, on November 17, he scored his first hat trick against the Minnesota North Stars. Linden {{finished}} the season {{tied for the}} team lead in goals (30) and second for points (59). He was the first Canucks rookie to score 30 goals and came within <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> tying Ivan Hlinka's team record of 60 points as a first-year player, set in 1981–82 (the record was later tied by Pavel Bure in 1991–92). Linden also became the first rookie to win the Cyclone Taylor Award, given to the Canucks' most valuable player. He {{was named to the}} NHL All-Rookie Team, and finished second to Brian Leetch, of the New York Rangers, in voting for the Calder Trophy, given to the rookie of the year. Fans voted him as the winner of The Hockey News rookie of the year award. The Canucks made the playoffs in the 1988–89 season, {{for the first time in}} three years, and Linden scored seven points in the Canucks' seven-game series loss to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Calgary Flames.|$|E
