5|$|The success <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>effort</b> led the Tamils {{to think}} {{confidently}} {{of themselves as}} a community and prepared the way for their awareness of a common cultural, religious and linguisitic kinship in the mid-nineteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Trajan's {{successor}} Hadrian {{adopted a}} policy of maintaining rather than expanding the empire. Borders (fines) were marked, and the frontiers (limites) patrolled. The most heavily fortified borders were the most unstable. Hadrian's Wall, which separated the Roman world from {{what was perceived as}} an ever-present barbarian threat, is the primary surviving monument <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>effort.</b>|$|E
5|$|A large {{section of}} the neighborhood, from around Kentucky Street to Broadway, was razed. Many {{buildings}} south of Lee Street, and nearly all south of Avery Street (renamed Cardinal Boulevard) were razed {{for the construction of}} Noe Middle School, expansions to Manual High School and a major expansion of the University of Louisville, as well as to expand local industry east of Floyd Street. From 1965 to 1971, 639 buildings were razed as a part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>effort.</b> However, the plan did spur the restoration of over 100 buildings in other parts of Old Louisville.|$|E

5|$|As the {{conflict}} raged, other Arab governments attempted {{to negotiate a}} peaceful resolution. As part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>effort,</b> Gamal Abdel Nasser led the first emergency Arab League summit in Cairo on 21 September. Arafat's speech drew sympathy from attending Arab leaders. Other heads of state took sides against Hussein, among them Muammar Gaddafi, who mocked him and his schizophrenic father King Talal. A ceasefire was agreed upon between the two sides, but Nasser died of a massive heart attack hours after the summit, and {{the conflict}} resumed shortly afterward.|$|E
5|$|As {{governor}} Beckham {{sought to}} unite his {{party and the}} state. As part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>effort</b> he supported changes to the blatantly partisan Goebel Election Law, authored by his late running mate while the latter {{was a member of}} the General Assembly. He stressed non-controversial issues such as improvements to roads and the state's educational system. He recommended passage of a law to set uniform school textbook prices, a reform both he and Goebel had advocated during the gubernatorial campaign. However, his passive leadership ensured that the General Assembly did little to address his agenda. The only major pieces of legislation passed during Beckham's term were a tax increase that added a half million dollars to the state's revenue and a child labor law that forbade children under 14to work without their parents' consent.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 12th century the Bigod family {{had come to}} {{dominate}} Suffolk, holding {{the title of the}} Earl of Norfolk and owning Framlingham and three other major castles at Bungay, Walton and Thetford. The first set of stone buildings, including the first hall, were built within the castle during the 1160s. Tensions persisted throughout the period, however, between the Crown and the Bigods. Hugh Bigod was {{one of a group of}} dissenting barons during the Anarchy in the reign of King Stephen, and after coming to power Henry II attempted to re-establish royal influence across the region. As part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>effort,</b> Henry confiscated the four Bigod castles from Hugh in 1157, but returned both Framlingham and Bungay in 1165, on payment of a large fine of Â£666.|$|E

5|$|During mid-1944 the Imperial Japanese Army's General Staff {{decided to}} {{reinforce}} the garrisons of the southern Philippines and Borneo ahead of an expected Allied offensive to liberate these areas. As part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>effort,</b> the 54th, 55th, 56th, 57th and 58th Independent Mixed Brigades were ordered to be formed for service with the Southern Expeditionary Army Group during June. Aside from the 58th Independent Mixed Brigade, which was formed by converting an existing unit, these new brigades were to be organised in forward areas from personnel shipped from Japan. Upon formation, the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade {{was assigned to the}} Borneo Defence Force (BDF).|$|E
5|$|In 1930 Allison {{returned}} to the University of Chicago, where he became a professor in 1942, and the Frank P. Hixon Distinguished Service Professor of Physics in 1959. He studied the Compton effect and the dynamical theory of x-ray diffraction. At the time x-rays were an important means of investigating atomic structures, but the concept that light had both wave and particle properties, as demonstrated by Arthur Compton, was not universally accepted. William Duane from Harvard spearheaded an effort to prove that Compton's interpretation of the Compton effect was wrong, and Allison became part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>effort.</b> Duane carried {{out a series of}} meticulous experiments to disprove Compton, but instead found overwhelming evidence that Compton was correct. To his credit, Duane conceded that this was the case.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, the United States Department of the Interior {{created the}} Southwestern Range and Sheep Breeding Laboratory {{to address the}} {{problems}} Rambouillet stock had caused for the Navajo economy. Located at Fort Wingate, New Mexico, the program's aim was to develop a new sheep bloodline that simulated the wool characteristics of the 19th-century Navajo-Churro stock and would also supply adequate meat. The Fort Wingate researchers collected old Navajo-Churro stock from remote parts of the reservation and hired a weaver to test their experimental wool. Offspring of these experiments were distributed among the Navajo people. World War II interrupted the greater part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>effort</b> when military work resumed at Fort Wingate.|$|E

5|$|In April 2009 it {{was decided}} by CITES that an {{in-depth}} review of the commercial dolphin trade conducted from the Solomon Islands should take place, this after the IUCN Cetacean Specialist Group {{came to the conclusion}} that insufficient population data exists to prove the sustainability of the wild captures and the current export quota of 100 animals per year. The Solomon Island Dolphin Abundance Project was established to provide data on the size of the local Indo-Pacific Bottlenose population and the sustainability of the dolphin hunts. A report published in March 2013 as a result <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>effort</b> indicated that the capture of dolphins in the Solomon Islands can only be sustainable at a very low rate and that previous rates of capture as seen between 2003 and 2013 would not be sustainable in the future.|$|E
5|$|In late 1944 the United States Twentieth Air Force's XXI Bomber Command {{prepared}} to conduct strategic bombing raids on the Japanese home islands from {{bases in the}} Mariana Islands. These attacks were to replace the largely unsuccessful Operation Matterhorn raids which had been conducted by XX Bomber Command aircraft based in India and staging through bases in China since June 1944. While XX Bomber Command conducted photo reconnaissance sorties over Japan as part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>effort,</b> the aircraft flying from China lacked the range to reach Japan's main industrial centers. Without photographic intelligence XXI Bomber Command was unable to develop detailed plans for raids against its intended targets.|$|E
5|$|Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources {{have been}} {{interpreted}} {{as part of}} a wider trend in the 1980s of so-called 'heritage cinema': period pieces and costume dramas that celebrated the history, culture and landscape of France. It was the official policy of President FranÃ§ois Mitterrand, elected in 1981, and particularly his Minister of Culture Jack Lang, to promote these kinds of films through increased funding of the ailing French film industry. Berri's pair of films stand as the most prominent example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>effort.</b> It has also been suggested that the treatment given the outsider Jean de Florette by the locals was symbolic of the growing popularity of the anti-immigration movement, led by politicians like Jean-Marie Le Pen.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrival of}} Protestant missionaries {{on a large}} scale {{beginning}} in 1814 was a primary contributor to the development of political awareness among Sri Lankan Tamils. Activities by missionaries of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions and Methodist and Anglican churches led to a revival among Hindu Tamils who created their own social groups, built their own schools and temples, and published their own literature to counter the missionary activities. The success <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>effort</b> led to a new confidence for the Tamils, encouraging them {{to think of themselves as}} a community, and it paved the way for their emergence as a cultural, religious, and linguistic society in the mid-19th century.|$|E
5|$|In March 1942 the {{squadron}} moved to RAF Redhill, Surrey where it assumed No. 452 Squadron's front line duties {{as part of}} No. 11 Group RAF. These included shipping protection patrols, escorting bombers, conducting fighter sweeps over northern France and contributing to the air defence of southern England. Fighter Command had received authorisation to launch a full-scale offensive campaign against German air units shortly before No.457 Squadron arrived at Redhill, and it became part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>effort.</b> The squadron first saw action on 26March when Brothers shot down a Bf109 during a multi-squadron fighter sweep over France, though one of its Spitfires was lost in this action. By {{the end of its}} first week of operations No.457 Squadron had shot down three German aircraft and inflicted damage on several others and it went on to conduct 32 operations over German territory by 26April. These operations often encountered fierce opposition, and German Fw190 fighters proved superior to the Spitfire Mark Vs that No.457 Squadron was equipped with. The squadron scored its last victory over Europe on 29April, though fighter sweeps over France continued until almost the end of May.|$|E

30|$|In view <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> <b>efforts</b> {{are being}} made to artificially {{construct}} the cellulosomes to depolymerize the cellulosic substrate to simple fermentable sugars for biofuel production. Moreover, with increase in understanding the physiology and mechanism of gene regulation of cellulosomes, efforts {{are being made}} {{for the expression of}} cellulosomal complexes in recombinant microorganisms (Nataf et al. 2010). During the past few years, efforts have been made for the construction of âdesigner cellulosomesâ, i.e., artificial complexes that could efficiently depolymerize cellulose. The construction of designer cellulosomes is very challenging, but this technology can be efficiently improved and utilized in the biorefineries (Fontes and Gilbert 2010).|$|R
