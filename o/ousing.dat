40|$|AREUEA Mid-Year Meeting for help-f~d comments, and Margaret Enis for {{excellent}} research assistance. H <b>ousing</b> construction plays {{a critical}} role in the economy. In-creases in housing starts raise construction employment, and recent home buyers often purchase other consumer durables, leading through the multiplier effect to increased employment. Construc-tion is especially important for the business cycle, because changes in residential construction tend to lead recessions and recoveries. In addi-tion, the elasticity of the supply of new housing is a determinant of movements in house prices, which affect both housing affordability and the wealth position of homeowners. Despite its importance, empirical research on housing supply is surprisingly rare. The dearth of work is particularly apparent when compared to the extensive literature on housing demand, a discrepancy noted in housing market overviews by Olsen (1987) and Smith, Rosen, and Fallis (1988), among others...|$|E
40|$|Housing {{allowances}} should enable economically weak households {{to accommodate}} in good qualitatively housing. Utilising a special {{feature of the}} Norwegian h <b>ousing</b> allowance system, we study how housing allowances affect the incidence of crowded living and mobility. We investigate housing market behaviour in a treatment group in {{a situation in which}} variations in housing situation feeds directly into variations in the amount of hous ing allowances received. This is compared it to the behaviour of a control group in a situation where variations in the housing market behaviour do not feed into variations of the amount of housing allowances received. Our empirical analyses reveal that t he probability of moving out of crowded housing conditions is 14 percent higher among housing allowance receivers whose amount of housing allowances is affected by marginal variations in the pre - allowance housing expenses, than in the control group. The fi ndings of this paper could have implications for the way housing allowance systems is designed and revised...|$|E
40|$|ØDecline {{in water}} quality caused by {{agricultural}} phosphorus (P) reported, especially in areas dominated by intensive animal operations. ØPhosphorus in animal wastes generally applied to cropland at rates that provide more P than needed. ØRisk of P transfer from soils to surface waters via runoff and leaching with high P concentrations in soils. ØLeaching risks more significant when P from animal production {{is applied to}} well-drained sandy soils of low P sorption capacity. ØSoil test P (STP) and P saturation ratios (PSR) often used to make environmental assessments of P in runoff and leachate. ØPSR: molar ratio of P to [Al+Fe], based on either Mehlich 1 or oxalate extractants. ØAbove 0. 15 PSR, higher risks of P loss for Florida soils (Nair e t al., 2004). ØNo information is available {{about the amount of}} P that can safely be added to a given soil before it becomes an environmental problem. <b>ØUsing</b> a 0. 15 PSR threshold, Nair and Harris (2004) defined safe soil P storage capacity (SPSC), which refers to the amount of P that can be safely added to a given volume or mass of soil before environmental concerns arise. Objective To evaluate the reduction in P storage capacity (SPSC) of dairy and poultry manure-amended soils in the field over 36 months as a consequence of continuous P loading...|$|E
5000|$|The {{downstream}} {{end of the}} Little <b>Ouse</b> has changed much over the centuries. In the Fens and Norfolk Marshland, it was quite possible for {{the course of a}} river to change {{as the result of a}} flooding episode so it is not surprising to find that the Great <b>Ouse</b> used to enter The Wash by way of the Old Croft River, the Wellstream and Wisbech (the <b>Ouse</b> beach). The modern lower Great <b>Ouse</b> was then the lower part of the Little <b>Ouse.</b> On this occasion, the change was artificial. The 17th century drainers under Cornelius Vermuyden dug the Old Bedford River between the Great <b>Ouse</b> at Earith and what had hitherto been the Little <b>Ouse</b> at Denver. A link was made for the Great <b>Ouse</b> between Littleport 1 and the Little <b>Ouse</b> at Brandon Creek (...) and both the drainage and the navigationwere directed towards King's Lynn rather than Wisbech.|$|R

40|$|To study {{peripheral}} circulation without interference by anesthesia and surgical trauma, {{the analysis of}} red blood cell velocity (RBC; flying spot technique) and capillary diameters (diameter-cap; angiometer or ruler) in the depilated auricle of rats was proposed (Hertel, Microcirculation, Endothelium, and Lymphatics, 3, i. p., 1986). The rats were placed in plastic tubes and the right auricle was positioned on a transparent block with electronically controlled temperature using intravital microscopic techniques (transmitted light). For recording on video tape (U-matic), a video camera was mounted {{on top of the}} microscope. 8 Wistar Kyoto (WKY) and 8 spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats were analysed. RBC and diameter-cap were stored on video tapes in the course of 9 weeks from week 18 after birth every Monday during 8 am and noon and every Tuesday from noon to 4 pm; a second group of rats was treated vice versa. The experiments were performed from July to September 1986. In the animal h <b>ousing</b> facilities the photophase lasts from 7 am to 7 pm. The results were expressed as means +- SEM, the t-test for dependent samples (am/pm) was used. The data show that in conscious rats there is a statistically significant decrease in capillary diameters (WKY: p< 0. 005, SHR: p< 0. 10) and in RBC-velocity (WKY: p< 0. 01, SHR: p< 0. 05) in the afternoon compared to the values measured in the morning in the same animal.

40|$|<b>OUSING</b> IS IMPORTANT {{to quality}} of life—in addi-tion to enough food and clothing, people {{expect to have}} a decent dwelling. But some {{households}} face affordability problems and {{may be forced to}} choose between appropriate housing and other necessities. Living in inappropriate housing can have permanent consequences, especially on children. A study by the Canadian Council on Social Develop-ment found that housing that is crowded or in disre-pair has negative effects on children’s health, behaviour and development (Jackson and Roberts 2001). The housing market has changed during the last two decades. Some of the transformations affected the supply side of the rental market. Investments in social housing diminished dramatically between 1985 and 1997 (Cooper 2001) and, at the same time, construc-tion of private rental dwellings fell. These factors, among others, led to fewer available rental units. According to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Cor-poration (CMHC), the average rental vacancy rate in metropolitan centres fell from 4. 3 % in 1996, to 1. 6 % in 2000, to 1. 1 % in 2001. This article examines how Canadians were housed in 2000. What percentage lived in owner-occupied homes? Were their homes in good condition? Was the size suitable for their needs? And, what proportion of their income was spent on housing? (see Data source and definitions). Ownership is tied to location and income Homeownership is a long-term investment that can help maintain one’s standard of living over the life cy-cle (see Life cycle and housing). Owners of mortgage-free homes can generate additional funds in retirement by Chart A: Two-thirds of households lived in owner-occupied homes...|$|E

5000|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the <b>Ouse</b> was once known as the 'Ure', but {{there seems to be no}} supporting evidence for this claim. The suggestion that the name derives from the Celtic name of the Ure, assumed to be Isurā from the Roman name for Aldborough, and over time evolved into Isis and finally the Saxon <b>Ouse,</b> would go some way to explaining how the little tributary <b>Ouse</b> Gill Beck usurps the name of the much larger River Ure.
