5|$|Chew Valley School is {{the main}} {{secondary}} school (11–18 years) for the valley. It is situated between Chew Magna and Chew Stoke. The latest (2011) Ofsted Inspection Report describes this specialist Performing Arts College as a mixed comprehensive school with 1,201 pupils on roll. The school is popular and <b>oversubscribed</b> with 226 students in the sixth form. The school {{has been successful in}} gaining a number of national and regional awards. There are state primary schools (4–11 years) in most of the local villages.|$|E
5|$|The WHT is {{operated}} by the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes (ING), together with the 2.5m Isaac Newton Telescope and 1.0m Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope. Offices and administration are located an hour's drive away in Santa Cruz de La Palma, the island's capital. Funding {{is provided by the}} UK's Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC, 65%), the Netherlands' Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO, 25%) and Spain's Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC, 10%) (2008 values). Telescope time is distributed in proportion to this funding, although Spain receives an additional 20% allocation in return for use of the observatory site. Five percent of observing time is further reserved for astronomers of other nationalities. As a competitive research telescope, the WHT is heavily <b>oversubscribed,</b> typically receiving applications for three to four times as much observing time as is actually available.|$|E
5|$|The XJ220 was not {{initially}} {{intended to be}} a production car, but, following the reception of the concept and financial interest from serious buyers, a feasibility study was carried out by teams from TWR and Jaguar. Its conclusion was that such a car would be technically feasible (subject to engineering changes), {{and that it would be}} financially viable. The announcement of a limited production run of 220 to 350 cars came on 20 December 1989. The list price on 1 January 1990 was £290,000 exclusive of value added tax, options and delivery charges, but by 1992 that had increased considerably owing to indexation of contracts. The offer was four times <b>oversubscribed,</b> and deposits of £50,000 exclusive of Value Added Tax (VAT) were taken from around 1400 customers; first deliveries were planned for mid-1992.|$|E
5|$|Melish {{had been}} fielding {{inquiries}} from collectors since Roosevelt signed the legislation, but from mid-May, those who wrote received back only postcards stating the new issue was <b>oversubscribed.</b> The summer of 1936 was {{the peak of}} the commemorative coin boom, and Melish announced the new pieces would be sold in sets of three by mint mark for $7.75 (a high price at that time). Order blanks were sent to those who had written early, and soon these blanks were selling for $10. Yet few collectors were successful in having their orders filled, with most having their payment returned as the coins had supposedly sold out. The sets quickly jumped in price to $40. At this high level, many coins proved available. Numismatist Q. David Bowers stated that these were most likely surreptitiously sold by Melish and other insiders. Melish also allowed the issuers of the York County, Maine Tercentenary half dollar to purchase, at the original issue price, several sets—members of the public could order at most one set at that price. In return, he sought to purchase that and other commemorative coins in quantities beyond the usual order limit. Nevertheless, when the Oregon Trail Memorial Association, issuer of the long-lived half dollar honoring the trail, tried to purchase a set, Melish replied that they were sold out.|$|E
25|$|St Nicholas Catholic Primary School in Jockey Road is a {{voluntary}} aided Catholic primary school. Established in 1967, {{there are currently}} about 210 pupils. The school is <b>oversubscribed.</b>|$|E

25|$|On 25 June 2014, HM Treasury {{became the}} first country outside of the Islamic world to issue a Sukuk. This £200 million issue was 11.5 times <b>oversubscribed</b> and was priced {{at the same level}} as the {{equivalent}} UK Gilts (UK government bonds) at 2.036% pa. The Sukuk was linked to the rental income of UK government property.|$|E
25|$|There are {{claims that}} Etisalat breaks {{the rules of}} net {{neutrality}} by throttling peer-to-peer, gaming {{and other types of}} network traffic {{in order to reduce the}} load on its <b>oversubscribed</b> international links. The effect of this interference is most noticeable during weekends or periods of high network use. The overall efficiency of the country-wide content filtering is unclear, as many of the technologically savvy users have discovered tools and methods to bypass the content filter, such as using Tor.|$|E
25|$|On 14 January 1896 Lawson {{incorporated}} The Daimler Motor Company Limited. A prospectus {{was issued}} on 15 February. The subscription lists opened on 17 February and closed, <b>oversubscribed,</b> the next day. The Daimler Motor Company Limited bought The Daimler Motor Syndicate Limited from Lawson's British Motor Syndicate as a going concern. Simms was appointed consulting engineer {{to the new}} business but {{was not to be}} on the board of directors, possibly because he had become a director of the Cannstatt firm.|$|E
25|$|In other areas, grammar schools survive {{mainly as}} very highly {{selective}} schools {{in an otherwise}} comprehensive county, for example {{in several of the}} outer boroughs of London. These schools are often heavily <b>oversubscribed,</b> and award places in rank order of performance in their entry tests. In some LEAs, as many as 10–15% of 11-year-olds may attend grammar schools (for example in Gloucestershire), but in other LEAs it is as low as 2%. These very highly selective schools also tend to dominate the top positions in performance tables.|$|E
25|$|In the 1800s {{middle class}} {{facilities}} became more common, replacing private care for wealthier persons. However, facilities {{in this period}} were largely <b>oversubscribed.</b> Individuals were referred to facilities either by the community or by the criminal justice system. Dangerous or violent cases were usually given precedence for admission. A survey taken in 1891 in Cape Town, South Africa shows the distribution between different facilities. Out of 2046 persons surveyed, 1,281 were in private dwellings, 120 in jails and 645 in asylums, with men representing nearly {{two thirds of the}} number surveyed.|$|E
25|$|Already {{one of the}} top-three British and Irish brewers, Guinness's sales soared from 350,000 barrels in 1868 to 779,000 barrels in 1876. In October 1886 Guinness {{became a}} public company, and was {{averaging}} sales of 1,138,000 barrels a year. This was despite the brewery's refusal to either advertise or offer its beer at a discount. Even though Guinness owned no public houses, the company was valued at £6 million and shares were twenty times <b>oversubscribed,</b> with share prices rising to a 60 percent premium {{on the first day}} of trading.|$|E
25|$|The ECB's first {{supplementary}} longer-term {{refinancing operation}} (LTRO) with a six-month maturity was announced March 2008. Previously the longest tender offered was three months. It announced two 3-month and one 6-month full allotment of Long Term Refinancing Operations (LTROs). The first tender was settled 3 April, and {{was more than}} four times <b>oversubscribed.</b> The €25 billion auction drew bids amounting to €103.1 billion, from 177 banks. Another six-month tender was allotted on 9 July, again to the amount of €25 billion. The first 12-month LTRO in June 2009 had close to 1100 bidders.|$|E
25|$|Heriot-Watt was {{established}} as the School of Arts of Edinburgh by Scottish businessman Leonard Horner on 16 October 1821. Having {{been inspired by}} Anderson's College in Glasgow, Horner established the School to provide practical knowledge {{of science and technology}} to Edinburgh's working men. The institution was initially of modest size, giving lectures two nights a week in rented rooms and boasting a small library of around 500 technical works. It was also <b>oversubscribed,</b> with admissions soon closing despite the cost of 15 shillings for a year's access to lectures and the library.|$|E
25|$|Meols Cop High School is {{situated}} in the Blowick area of Southport {{and is one of}} the six schools in the country chosen to be written about in OfSTED's School Inspections handbook of 2012. Meols Cop High School has recently become one of the highest achieving schools in Sefton, with 96% of the students obtaining at least 5 GCSE's at A*-C grades. The school is <b>oversubscribed</b> and is currently building an additional 2 new classrooms to make way for new year groups with the number of students increasing every year. The school is a specialist school in sports.|$|E
25|$|In October 2006, the Senior Management Board {{proposed}} {{the closure of}} its Physics Department to future undergraduate application. This was ascribed to financial reasons and lack of alternative ideas and caused considerable controversy, not least a debate in Parliament over the closure which prompted heated discussion of higher education issues in general. On 10 October the Senate voted to close the Department of Physics, a move confirmed by the Council on 20 November. Other departments closed in recent years include Music, Sociology, Geology, and Mechanical Engineering. The university council decided in March 2009 to close the School of Health and Social Care, a school whose courses have consistently been <b>oversubscribed.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of centre and show court tickets {{sold to the}} general public have since 1924 been made available by a public ballot that the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club holds {{at the start of the}} year. The ballot has always been substantially <b>oversubscribed.</b> Successful applicants are selected at random by a computer. The most recent figures from 2011 suggested there were four applicants to every ballot ticket. Applications must be posted to arrive at the AELTC by the last day of December in the year prior to the tournament. Seats and days are allocated randomly and ballot tickets are not transferrable.|$|E
25|$|Alongside {{four other}} applicants, CTL {{submitted}} their licence {{application to the}} Australian Broadcasting Control Board in April 1959. The company went public in September of the same year, on the Australian Stock Exchange in Sydney, offering 100,000 shares which were immediately <b>oversubscribed,</b> ending up with a total subscribed capital of A£300,000 (A$600,000). The two key shareholders in CTL made an agreement with all other shareholders that all shares were to be bought back {{in the event that}} they were unsuccessful in their licence bid— they need not have worried, since after a hearing of considerable length, the ABCB decided to grant CTL the licence in November 1960. The callsign for the station was to be CTC and the new service was to transmit on VHF channel 7.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} pointed out that the four {{replacement}} bus services - routes 17 (Gillingham - Cliffe, hourly), 19 and 65 (Gillingham - Grain, every 80 mins) and 47 (Gravesend to Cliffe, 10 per day) - were inadequate and would cause hardship to the local community as their timings would not allow passengers the same the ease or flexibility of use as that offered by rail transport. For example, the journey time of workers going to Uralite Halt from Gravesend by rail was 6 minutes, as opposed to 29 minutes by bus, while the journey from Gravesend to Allhallows was 34 minutes by rail and 1 hour 16 minutes by bus. The buses would also be <b>oversubscribed</b> at peak-times by schoolchildren.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, the new Suzuki Grand Vitara XL-7 was {{introduced}} while the Zen and the Wagon R were upgraded and redesigned. The four millionth Maruti vehicle was built and they {{entered into a}} partnership with the State Bank of India. Maruti Udyog Ltd was Listed on BSE and NSE after a public issue, which was <b>oversubscribed</b> tenfold. In 2004, the Alto became India's best selling car overtaking the Maruti 800 after nearly two decades. The five-seater Versa 5-seater, a new variant, was created while the Esteem was re-launched. Maruti Udyog closed the financial year 2003-04 with an annual sale of 472,122 units, the highest ever since the company began operations and the fiftieth lakh (5 millionth) car rolled out in April 2005. The 1.3L Suzuki Swift five-door hatchback {{was introduced}} in 2005.|$|E
25|$|During 1965 it {{was decided}} to make Northern Songs a public company to reduce their income tax burden. 1,250,000 shares were traded on the London Stock Exchange, which were worth 17 pence each ($0.28), but were offered at 66 pence ($1.09) each. Although the trade was scoffed at by various {{financial}} institutions, it was expected that the application lists would not remain open for more than 60 seconds, which is exactly what happened, as the lists were <b>oversubscribed.</b> After the offer was closed, Lennon and McCartney owned 15% each, worth £195,200 ($320,000), NEMS a 7.5% interest, and James and Silver (who served as Northern Songs' chairmen), controlling 37.5%, with Harrison and Starr sharing 1.6%. The remaining shares were owned by various financial institutions. At the same time, Lennon and McCartney renewed their previous three-year publishing contracts, binding them to Northern Songs until 1973. Harrison also signed with the company in 1965, for a period of three years. To protect his interests, James took out a life insurance policy of £500,000 on Lennon and McCartney. By the summer of 1966, 88 songs by Lennon and McCartney had been recorded and released, amounting to 2,900 versions by different artists.|$|E
25|$|On 7 February 1825, {{a second}} loan to Greece was {{floated in the}} City of London. Despite {{the fact that the}} Greek {{government}} had squandered the money from the first loan, the second loan was <b>oversubscribed</b> and raised some £1.1 million. Unlike the first loan, the second loan from the City was to be managed by a Board of Control in London, consisting of the banker Samson Ricardo, two MPs, Edward Ellice and Sir Francis Burdett and John Cam Hobhouse of the London Greek Committee, who were to use the money to buy warships and other supplies, which would then be handed over to the Greeks. After the Greek government had wasted most of the money from the first loan, the City did not trust them to spend the money from the second loan wisely. The Board of Control used the money to hire the naval hero, Lord Cochrane, to command the Greek Navy and to buy steamships. One of the British philhellenes, Frank Abney Hastings believed that the use of mechanised warships powered by steam and using red-hot shot would allow the Greeks to destroy the Ottoman navy, powered as it was by sail. Hastings persuaded the Board of Control to invest in the revolutionary technology of the steamship, making the first use of a mechanised warship in a war. The two loans from the City imposed a crippling burden on a poor nation like Greece, and only in 1878 was a deal struck between the British creditors and the Greek government to reduce the loans, now worth £10 million, with unpaid interest down to one and a half million pounds sterling, and even then it took the Greeks decades to pay off the loans.|$|E

On 6 January 2012, JAL announced its intent to re-list its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in {{an initial public offering}} of up to ¥1 trillion, which would be the largest offering in Japan in more than a year. The airline completed its IPO on the 1st section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (...) on 19 September 2012. The Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation of Japan sold all its holdings (96.5%) in JAL for 650 billion yen, greater than its 350 billion yen investment in 2010. Even though it was <b>oversubscribed</b> several times, post IPO increase of the stock was close to 1%.|$|E

500|$|The Cleveland Centennial and Great Lakes Exposition {{opened on}} June 27, 1936, and before it closed on October 4, some {{four million people}} passed through its gates. [...] Located on a 150-acre (61 ha) site by the shores of Lake Erie, there were artistic and {{industrial}} exhibits, {{as well as the}} usual amusements. The half dollars were sold at the fairgrounds, at Ohio banks, and by mail order from Melish's office in Cincinnati. Editor Lee Hewitt commented in the Numismatic Scrapbook, [...] "it seems strange that Mr. Melish, living in Cincinnati, should be the distributor of the Cleveland issue." [...] The Cincinnati Musical Center coin had quickly sold out, the pieces Melish allowed on the market many times <b>oversubscribed,</b> but for the Cleveland piece, [...] "Melish's sales strategy had to be very different; the coins would have to be aimed at the Exposition visitors and the general public at $1.50 each, not at his own coterie of greedy speculators".|$|E
