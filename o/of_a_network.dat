How to evaluate the vulnerability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> security <b>network?</b> We bring forward <b>a</b> protection model <b>of</b> <b>a</b> security system based on Neyman-Pearson criterion. According to the model, we propose methods to determine the most vulnerable path <b>of</b> <b>a</b> security <b>network.</b> The protection probability of the most vulnerable path is {{used to assess the}} vulnerability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> security <b>network.</b> Ultimately, we can gain insight about the vulnerability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> security <b>network.</b> Keywords-security network; vulnerability evaluation; neyman-pearson criterion; protection probability.

After the fall of the Roman Empire, Cassel became an important fortified stronghold for the rulers of Flanders which was repeatedly fought over before finally being annexed to France in the 17th century. It was the headquarters of Marshal Ferdinand Foch during part of the First World War. In 1940, during the German invasion of France, Cassel was the scene of a fierce three-day battle between British and German forces which resulted in much of the town being destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Extending the police's {{presence}} {{across the}} region was logistically challenging, requiring the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>network</b> of new posts {{and the use of}} steamers to move supplies around the coast. It proved to be a harsh existence for the force, particularly when deliveries of supplies were delayed by bad weather. Work began on a railroad to Hudson Bay in 1908, continuing for two decades, which, although it required substantial police assistance, gradually eased the challenge of supplying the police outposts around the bay. The police opened temporary detachments around York Factory in 1912, and then at Port Nelson in 1913, where the police established their divisional headquarters. Patrols pushed up into Baker Lake and along the Coppermine River until, {{by the end of the}} decade, the police presence in Hudson Bay had been reduced to a bare minimum, with the force focusing on reaching out into ever more remote areas.|$|E

New characters appear such as Lili Wing, a brothel madam and former lover of Bond whose ultimate fate is to be crushed {{in the back of a}} garbage truck, and Gita, wife of Le Chiffre. The beautiful Gita, whose face and throat are hideously disfigured as a result of Bond using her as a shield during a gunfight in the same sequence which sees Wing meet her fate, goes on to become the prime protagonist in the torture scene that features in the book, a role originally Le Chiffre's.|$|E
