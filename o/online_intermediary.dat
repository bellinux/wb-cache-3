40|$|The {{internet}} {{has become a}} particularly important means for distribution in the tourism industry, leading {{to the emergence of}} many global companies operating as <b>online</b> <b>intermediaries.</b> While research has focused on the strategies of these intermediaries and the distribution strategies of hotel chains, limited research {{attention has been paid to}} online distribution with regard to regional small accommodation providers. This study investigates the perspective of these organizations with regard to their evaluations of <b>online</b> <b>intermediaries</b> and their resulting online distribution strategies. Adopting a multiple case study strategy, the research finds that the interests of the small accommodation providers and <b>online</b> <b>intermediaries</b> conflict and result in dissatisfaction. This is resulting in small accommodation providers moving away from contracting <b>online</b> <b>intermediaries</b> in favour of search engine optimization (SEO) of their own website. The study concludes by discussing the implications, and associated issues, of such a strategy...|$|R

When deciding whether to utilize an <b>online</b> <b>intermediary</b> in addition to their own distribution channels, quality differentiated service providers face the trade-off between the benefit of extended reach and the threat of increased competition. Using an analytical framework, we analyze when and how service providers may utilize an <b>online</b> <b>intermediary</b> to their advantage in the presence of advance selling (i. e., selling a service at an early date for future consumption). In general, when an <b>online</b> <b>intermediary</b> is used, the competition effect dominates the reach effect and leads to a falling price trend. Interestingly, we find that the negative effect of increased competition on profits, due to intermediary usage, can be reversed by committing to self-imposed participation limits (i. e., selling only a predetermined amount of services through the <b>online</b> <b>intermediary).</b> This ensures that the service provider is better off selling through both its own site and the <b>online</b> <b>intermediary,</b> rather than selling exclusively using either channel.

40|$|Internet-based {{information}} and communication technologies (ICTs) have offered opportunities to reconfigure supply chains. A new kind of intermediary has emerged in many industries; the cybermediary—an <b>online</b> <b>intermediary</b> that only operates in the virtual environment. Many new types of <b>online</b> <b>intermediary</b> have emerged with differing business models. As yet, there have been few attempts to describe and categorise their e-business practices or to analyse the roles that they play within their supply chains. This paper seeks to address this deficiency by addressing both the theory and practise of online intermediaries. A two-dimensional framework based on the roles of cybermediaries and their relationships between supplier and buyer in the supply chain is developed from a synthesis of the extant literature. Five roles of cybermediaries are identified: informational, transactional, assurance, logistical and customisation. Cybermediary relationships are characterised in terms of their affiliation to customers and suppliers. Case studies of three online intermediaries are presented to illustrate and test the framework. An analysis of the empirical data from these cases served to demonstrate the utility of the framework in categorising online intermediaries and offering additional understandings of the rapidly evolving world of virtual supply chains...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the legal framework governing the liability of <b>online</b> <b>intermediaries</b> in the European Union (EU). The E-Commerce Directive undoubtedly constitutes the key legal instrument targeting <b>online</b> <b>intermediaries</b> on the EU-wide level. After outlining the key provisions in this Directive, the paper will analyze the Google Spain ruling as a case study. This ruling is particularly interesting for two reasons. First of all, it involves a type of intermediary (search engine) whose legal position is largely undefined at the EU level. Secondly, the Google Spain case concerns the position of search engines vis-à-vis the personal data they process. In this regard, it is an ideal case study with which to evaluate the interaction between the intermediary liability regime and data protection law. Additionally, it provides food for thought with regard to the role of intermediaries in the governance of the Internet. status: publishe...|$|R

We characterize the signaling equilibria where certification of quality conveys sometimes clear and sometimes noisy information about organizational effectiveness in generating socially valuable services.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to simplify the}} liability of <b>online</b> <b>intermediaries</b> as publishers of third party defamatory content that they host. It proposes that due to two significant gaps in the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015, the law of defamation must be reformed to provide predictable outcomes for intermediaries. The author offers solutions under two headings: the period before an intermediary has knowledge of third party content; and the period after which the intermediary becomes aware of its existence. For the former, this paper proposes that the innocent dissemination defence is reformed to apply to <b>online</b> <b>intermediaries.</b> For the latter, the author asserts that personal and commercial operators should be held to different knowledge standards leading to liability, based on traditional defamation principles.

It also introduces the principle of severance, which European Union and United Kingdom case law apply to define precisely the content for which the intermediary is liable.

The theoretical background for this is provided by two very different narratives of regulation of and through technology: Spar?s regulatory cycle in response to new technological inventions and Foucault?s account of the panopticon effect in modern regulation. The currency of these narratives is tested against the regulatory reality of the internet, which is increasingly informed by cases and legislative measures taken against <b>online</b> <b>intermediaries,</b> such as ISPs, Google, eBay, Facebook or Wikipedia. This raises the question of why intermediaries should be such popular regulatory targets in the first place.
