5|$|As {{with the}} other majors, winning the Masters gives a golfer several {{privileges}} which make his career more secure. Masters champions are automatically invited {{to play in the}} other three majors (the U.S. Open, The Open Championship, and the PGA Championship) {{for the next five years}} (except for amateur winners, unless they turn pro within the five-year period), and earn a lifetime invitation to the Masters. They also receive membership <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Tour</b> for the following five seasons and invitations to The Players Championship for five years.|$|E
5|$|The San Diego Surf of the American Basketball Association {{is located}} in the city. The annual Farmers Insurance Open golf tournament (formerly the Buick Invitational) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Tour</b> occurs at Torrey Pines Golf Course.

The amateur beach sport Over-the-line was invented in San Diego, and the annual world Over-the-line championships are held at Mission Bay every year.|$|E
5|$|The reigning {{champion}} of the competition is automatically invited {{to play in the}} other three majors for the next five years, and is exempt from qualifying for the PGA Championship for life. The champion also receives membership <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Tour</b> for the following five years and invitations to The Players Championship for five years. The prize of the tournament is the Wanamaker Trophy, which the champion keeps until the following year's competition. The PGA Championship was originally a match play event; however, in 1958 it was changed to a stroke play event.|$|E

In 2014 Stanley only had one top-ten and {{finished}} 148th <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Tour's</b> money list, and thereby lost his full-time <b>PGA</b> <b>Tour</b> status. In 2015 Stanley split his time <b>on</b> both <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Tour</b> and <b>the</b> Web.com Tour.

5|$|Woods' {{performance}} {{continued to}} suffer in 2011, {{taking its toll}} on his ranking. After falling to No. 7 in March, he rebounded to No. 5 with a strong showing at the 2011 Masters Tournament, where he tied for fourth place. Due to leg injuries incurred at the Masters, he missed several summer stops <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Tour.</b> In July, he fired his longtime caddy Steve Williams (who {{was shocked by the}} dismissal), and replaced him on an interim basis with friend Bryon Bell. After returning to tournament play in August, Woods continued to falter, and his ranking gradually fell to a low of #58. He rose to No. 50 in mid-November after a third-place finish at the Emirates Australian Open, and broke his winless streak with a victory at December's Chevron World Challenge.|$|E
5|$|Woods {{began his}} 2012 season with two tournaments (the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship and the AT Pebble Beach National Pro-Am) {{where he started}} off well, but {{struggled}} on the final rounds. Following the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, where he was knocked out {{in the second round}} by missing a 5-foot putt, Woods revised his putting technique and tied for second at the Honda Classic, with the lowest final round score in his PGA Tour career. After a short time off due to another leg injury, Woods won the Arnold Palmer Invitational, his first win <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Tour</b> since the BMW Championship in September 2009. Following several dismal performances, Woods notched his 73rd PGA Tour win at the Memorial Tournament in June, tying Jack Nicklaus in second place for most PGA Tour victories; a month later, Woods surpassed Nicklaus with a win at the AT National, to trail only Sam Snead, who accumulated 82 PGA tour wins.|$|E

5|$|Woods had a poor showing at the 2013 U.S Open as {{a result}} of an elbow injury {{sustained}} at The Players Championship. In finishing at 13-over-par, he recorded his worst score ever as a professional and finished 12 strokes behind winner Justin Rose. After a prolonged break because of the injury, during which he missed the Greenbrier Classic and his own AT National, he returned at the Open Championship at Muirfield. Despite being in contention all week and beginning the final round only two strokes behind Lee Westwood, he struggled with the speed of the greens and could only manage a 3-over-par 74 that left him tied for 6th place, five strokes behind eventual winner Phil Mickelson. Two weeks later, Woods returned to form at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, recording his 5th win of the season and 8th win at the event in its 15-year history. His second round 61 matched his record score <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Tour</b> and could easily have been a 59 were it not for some short missed birdie putts on the closing holes. This gave him a seven stroke lead that he held onto for the rest of the tournament. Woods would never contend at the PGA Championship at Oak Hill Country Club and would come short of winning a major for the 5th full season, only contending in two of the four majors in 2013.|$|E
25|$|Singh has won 22 times <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Tour</b> since turning 40 â€“ {{beating the}} record {{previously}} set by Sam Snead.

He has spent over 540 weeks {{ranked in the top}} 10 of the Official World Golf Ranking.
