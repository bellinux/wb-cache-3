One way of making khaep mu is to first cure the pork skin, with an attached layer of fat, in salt for several days, after which it is soaked in water {{for a couple of}} hours. This ensures that the fat cells will expand, resulting in a [...] "puffed skin" [...] after cooking. The slabs of belly fat are then slowly cooked at a low heat in, preferably, lard but <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> and vegetable oil can also be used. Similar to a confit, the pork thus treated can be stored. The pork is then cut into smaller pieces and baked in an oven until perfectly crispy. Another method of making the pork rinds again involves salting the pork skin, but instead of soaking it, the skin is hung out to dry in the sun after which it is sliced and deep-fried twice. Yet another way to make this dish in Thailand is to first cut the pork skin into strips, then boil them in water after which they are thoroughly dried before being deep-fried.|$|E
40|$|The aim of our {{experiment}} {{was to determine}} the effect of the alfalfa meal component in feed mixtures of Ross broiler chickens on oxidative stability of meat. Proportion of alfalfa meal in feed mixtures was 4 and 6 %. The results were compared to the control group without alfalfa meal in feed mixtures. At the end of the experiment (day 38), 6 pcs of broiler chickens from each group with an average live body weight over 1 800 g were randomly selected. The samples for chemical analysis consisted of identical proportion of breast and thigh muscle, and about 1 cm 2 of skin with subcutaneous fat. Fat from the meat was obtained after the samples drying. A fat was determined by extraction by means of laboratory instrument Det N Gras Selecta P. The oxidative stability of meat on the basis of acid number of fat was determided by chemical analysis. Chicken meat was stored at - 18 °C for 12 months and 18 months. The acid number of fat of stored meat for 12  months was 7. 38 mg KOH per g in the control group, 7. 42 mg KOH per g in the group with a proportion of 4 % alfalfa meal, and 11. 18 mg KOH per g in the group with proportion 6 % alfalfa meal. An acid number of fat of stored meat for 18 months was 5. 90 mg KOH per g in the control group, 4. 65 mg KOH per g in the group with a proportion of 4 % alfalfa meal, and 7. 07 mg KOH per g in the group with a proportion of 6 % alfalfa meal. Chicken meat is notably sensitive to lipid oxidation because of its high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Legislation in Title 5 of Part 3 of the Codex Alimentarius of the Slovak Republic and the Government Regulation No. 286 / 2003 Coll. in the Annex 4 in Part B provide the requirements for animal fats and meat products. Regulation of the European Parliament and Council (EC) No. 853 / 2004 lays down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin. In particular, determination of free fatty acids content of rendered animal fat (tallow, lard, <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> <b>fat).</b> Legislative regulation does not contain requirements for the quality of chicken meat, the acid number of   fat of fresh or frozen chicken meat, respectively. A chicken meat is preferred over other kinds of meat. It is characterized by certain dietary and nutritional properties that consumer prefers. A price of this kind of meat remains attractive. In terms of human health, oxidative stability of chicken meat is important, especially of stored meat. In general terms, the various food additives are currently used to maintain the food stability. Great attention is currently paid to additives of natural origin. Similar focus is presented in our study. We can state, {{on the basis of the}} oxidative stability results of chicken meat, that natural feed component has its justification. This issue requires further research.

40|$|RATIONALE: Triacylglycerols (TG) contain three fatty acyls {{attached}} to the glycerol backbone in stereochemically numbered positions sn- 1, 2 and 3. Isobaric TG with exchanged fatty acyl chains in positions sn- 1 / 3 vs. sn- 2 {{are referred to as}} regioisomers and the determination of their regioisomeric ratios is important for nutrition purposes. METHODS: Differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) is applied for the separation of simple unsaturated TG regioisomers extracted from porcine adipose tissue using their silver-ion molecular adducts. RESULTS: Four pairs of TG regioisomers containing combinations of unsaturated and saturated fatty acyl chains are successfully separated using DMS with 1 -butanol or 1 -propanol as the chemical modifier. Various experimental parameters are carefully optimized, such as the separation and compensation voltages applied to DMS electrodes, the type and flow rate of chemical modifier and the dwell time of analyte ions in the DMS cell. The optimized DMS approach is used for the characterization of TG regioisomers in less than one minute, compared to tens of minutes typical for silver-ion or reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry approaches. CONCLUSIONS: The application of this method for the characterization of TG regioisomers in porcine adipose tissue shows the method suitability for analyses of <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> <b>fats.</b> Triglyceridy obsahují tři mastné kyseliny které jsou spojené pře glycerolový řetězec.
