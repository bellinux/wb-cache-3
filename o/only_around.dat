5|$|At 00:50 {{the brigade}} started landing at DZ-N, {{just north of}} Ranville. Equipment and navigational {{failures}} by the RAF pilots and the division's pathfinders resulted in the brigade being {{scattered all over the}} countryside. By 02:40 <b>only</b> <b>around</b> 40 per cent of the 7th Parachute Battalion had reached their assembly point. Unable to wait any longer, the battalion headed for the captured bridges, and established a defensive position in Benouville, the division's only position west of the Caen Canal. Most of the 12th Parachute Battalion landed on {{the eastern edge of the}} DZ, and <b>only</b> <b>around</b> 60 per cent of the battalion arrived at their assembly point. Their objective was to secure the village of Le Bas de Ranville, which was achieved by 04:00. The 13th Parachute Battalion could also only muster around 60 per cent of its strength on the DZ. This battalion had two objectives; to secure Ranville and to clear the DZ of obstacles for the division's gliders which were to land next.|$|E
5|$|At birth {{the lungs}} are very undeveloped with <b>only</b> <b>around</b> one sixth of the alveoli {{of the adult}} lung present. The alveoli {{continue}} to form into early adulthood, {{and their ability to}} form when necessary is seen in the regeneration of the lung. Alveolar septa have a double capillary network instead of the single network of the developed lung. Only after the maturation of the capillary network can the lung enter a normal phase of growth. Following the early growth in numbers of alveoli there is another stage of the alveoli being enlarged.|$|E

By the 13th century Roman Catholicism had become the dominant religion throughout Poland.|$|E
5|$|Robinett, as a {{means to}} {{maintain}} his name on his game, included a hidden message in Adventure identifying himself as the creator, inspired by the supposedly hidden messages left on various songs recorded by The Beatles. In discussing the game in 2015, Robinett considered the message {{as a means}} of self-promotion, noting that he had been paid <b>only</b> <b>around</b> $22,000 a year from Atari without any royalties, while Atari would sell a million units of a game at $25 a piece. This secret is one of the earliest known Easter eggs in a video game.|$|E

In 2006 and 2007, the two organizations worked together to complete DNA testing on the breed with the goals of mapping the Marsh Tacky's place among the horse breeds of the world and beginning a stud book. In 2007, an association was begun with the objective of preserving and promoting the Marsh Tacky; and in 2010 a closed stud book was created.|$|E

5|$|The {{economic}} development in India followed socialist-inspired politicians {{for most of its}} independent history, including state-ownership of many sectors; India's per capita income increased at <b>only</b> <b>around</b> 1% annualised rate in the three decades after its independence. Since the mid-1980s, India has slowly opened up its markets through economic liberalisation. After more fundamental reforms since 1991 and their renewal in the 2000s, India has progressed towards a free market economy.|$|E
