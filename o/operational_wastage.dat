40|$|This paper adopts the metafrontier {{model to}} analyze and compare the {{technical}} efficiency of small and large UK airports. The interesting feature of the model is that it {{takes into account the}} technological differences in the estimation of efficiency, and thus increases the accuracy in the efficiency comparison between heterogeneous airports. Results show that large airports are generally more technically efficient and have less <b>operational</b> <b>wastage</b> than small airports. Along with size, factors such as location, technological access, and capital investments could contribute to the efficiency difference between small and large airports...|$|E
40|$|Manufacturing {{processes}} tend {{to produce}} <b>operational</b> <b>wastages</b> due to various reasons, {{which can be}} reduced by identifying and eliminating those using Six Sigma methodologies. In the presented work, DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control) {{has been used to}} reduce cord wastages in belt manufacturing. Core issues, pain areas or processes related to cord wastages are identified to formulate the problem. Later the concerned data is collected to examine the current performance and process capability; also the root causes are identified. Solutions are found out from improvement point of view, and various tools are properly implemented for tracking the processes. This study reports reduction in cord wastages in belt manufacturing through reduction in DPMO (Defects per Million Opportunities) from 549531 to 17240, also the Sigma Level isimproved from 1. 37 to 3. 6...|$|R
40|$|Flange tube, Glass shell, Lead in Wire (LIW), Filament (Coil) and Cap are {{the most}} {{important}} raw materials in case of Lamp Production Process. Manufacturing processes tend to produce <b>operational</b> <b>wastages</b> due to various reasons, which can be reduced by identifying and eliminating those reasons. It has been a very challenging engineering problem particularly in a multistage manufacturing, where maximum number of processes and activities are performed. With the help of Pareto diagrams, which are mostly used to identify critical areas, the manufacturing process defects in the each stage of the production belt have been prioritized by arranging them in decreasing order of importance. Then cause and effect diagram is being applied to explore possible causes/factors of defects and to determine the causes/factors, which has the greatest effect. Key words: Lamp production process; Multistage manufacturing; Pareto diagrams; Production belt; Cause and effect diagra...|$|R
40|$|PT Krakatau Steel (Persero) Tbk is {{currently}} {{faced with the}} situation of business conditions characterized by raw material prices continue to rise and <b>operational</b> costs <b>wastage</b> resulting in increased cost of goods sold thus decrease the profitability of the company. Many factors can cause these problems, one of it {{is determined by the}} competence and professionalism of the employees, especially those directly related to the production line. HR competencies problems caused by the company does not have a model to ensure and maintain the specific competencies of employees who refer to job competence standards through the implementation of the competency assessment to give recognition to the professional certification/ allowances are integrated so that has an impact on the operating cost savings program (increasing the value of the company) as well as improvement specific competencies program of employees through training programs. Based on the analysis of the questionnaire influences the relationship between professional certification and organizational performance that is filled by the managements of the company 2 Ì† 7 s management indicated that professional certification and significantly positively related to organizational performance...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} poster. The {{physical}} environment of healthcare facilities {{has a significant}} impact on the safety and effectiveness of healthcare services and has been linked to errors, inadequate care, inefficient systems, <b>operational</b> failure and <b>wastage.</b> The adverse effects of human error in anaesthetic practice have been recognized for many years and it has been suggested that changes to the anaesthetic workspace could contribute to a reduction in these errors. This poster will describe a project using 2 ergonomics methods (Hierarchical Task Analysis and Link Analysis) to investigate the tasks, human-environment interactions and latent design errors of the working environment of an anaesthetic room. The task is defined as starting with the planning and (re-) arrangement of the work space, preparing the anaesthetic drugs, preparing the patient, administering the anaesthetic and monitoring the patient before transfer into the Operating Room...|$|R
40|$|The {{operational}} activities {{of a community}} hospital blood bank are described at all levels with special attention given to the inventory management of the bank. A distinguishing feature of this blood bank {{is the use of}} a centrifuge-freezer system which, prior to the ten day age limit, breaks down whole blood into its basic constituents, and stores them for extended periods far exceeding the normal twenty-one day shelf life of whole blood. The inventory management policies thus include regulating the input of blood into the bank, the transfer of blood from the refrigerator to the freezer and the issuing policy of blood for various medical needs. Concomitant to these problems is the problem of forecasting demand. In addition to containing a descriptive model with all its complexity, this paper includes discussion of a future simulation study which compares the <b>operational</b> characteristics (shortage, <b>wastage</b> and cost) of the blood bank with and without the freezer system.
