5|$|In June 2009, Commissioner Tanya Perrin-Johnson wrote {{a series}} of e-mails that were sent to about 20 {{employees}} in her department directing them {{to work on the}} mayor's re-election campaign. The <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> <b>Special</b> Counsel began an investigation to determine whether the e-mails represented a violation of the federal Hatch Act, which, among other things, prohibits employees involved in federally funded programs from using their authority to influence political campaigns. As a result of the probe, in 2010 the Common Council decided to delay her reappointment as commissioner until the investigation concluded. She had been serving in an interim capacity. In April 2011, Perrin-Johnson resigned her position.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{is remembered}} in the CIA {{as its first}} {{successful}} Director of Central Intelligence, {{and one of its}} most effective, who redefined its structure and mission. The CIA's expansive covert action program remained the responsibility of Frank Wisner's quasi-independent Office of Policy Coordination (OPC), but Smith began to bring OPC under the DCI's control. In early January 1951 he made Allen Dulles the first Deputy Director for Plans (DDP), to supervise both OPC and the CIA's separate espionage organization, the <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> <b>Special</b> Operations (OSO). Not until January 1952 were all intelligence functions consolidated under a Deputy Director for Intelligence (DDI). Wisner succeeded Dulles as DDP in August 1951, and it took until August 1952 to merge the OSO and the OPC, each of which had its own culture, methods, and pay scales, into an effective, single directorate.|$|E

Nick Matzke, Jason Rosenhouse and other critics have commented that the <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> <b>Special</b> Counsel itself appears biased in its initial handling of the matter, given the links between the religious right and the Republican Party, with George W.
