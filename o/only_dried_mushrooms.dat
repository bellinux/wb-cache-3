The <b>dried</b> <b>mushroom</b> samples packaged in four different packaging materials; high density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), laminated aluminum foil (LAF), high density polyethylene under vacuum (HDPEV) were stored at freezing (0 °C) temperatures for 12 weeks. Samples were collected at 2 -week intervals and analyzed for proximate composition (carbohydrate, protein, fat, fiber, ash, moisture), mineral content (calcium, potassium), vitamin C content, and microbiological qualities (total aerobic count, Pseudomonal count, Coliform count, Staphylococcal count, Salmonella count) using the standard laboratory procedures. Carbohydrate, protein, fat content of <b>dried</b> <b>mushrooms</b> packaged in HDPE at freezing temperature ranged from 45. 2 % to 53. 5 %, 18. 0 % to 20. 3 %, and 3. 2 % to 4. 3 %, while mushrooms in polypropylene ranged from 45. 2 % to 53. 5 %, 18. 5 % to 20. 3 %, 2. 6 % to 4. 3 %.

30|$|This {{study is}} {{part of an effort to}} improve the quality of <b>dried</b> shiitake <b>mushrooms</b> [Lentinula edodes (Berk.)

The smell was evaluated using powdered <b>dried</b> shiitake <b>mushrooms.</b> Age, original preference (OP), sex, sensory intensity (SI), hedonic preference (HP), and sample amount were set as parameters. About 70 % of panelists liked <b>dried</b> shiitake <b>mushrooms.</b> There were significant correlations among age, OP, and SI. There was also a significant correlation between OP and HP, but no significant correlation between SI and HP. However, when the panelists were classified by OP, there was an optimal value between SI and HP for likers and neutralists. The calculated optimal concentration of <b>dried</b> shiitake <b>mushrooms</b> for likers and neutralists ranged widely. On the other hand, there was a significant negative correlation between SI and HP for dislikers, and their HP decreased according to the increase in the amount of the substance.

30|$|The {{smell of}} food {{is one of}} the most {{important}} factors in assessing its quality. Concerning the smell of <b>dried</b> shiitake <b>mushrooms</b> [Lentinula edodes (Berk.) Pegler], 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 -pentathiepane, commonly known as lenthionine, has been reported as a key compound. However, other compounds have not been studied sufficiently in connection with smell. From the results of sensory intensity studies and sensory evaluations of <b>dried</b> shiitake <b>mushrooms,</b> a positive significant correlation at 1 % risk was observed between sensory intensity and sulfur perception. This showed that the smell of <b>dried</b> shiitake <b>mushrooms</b> was characterized by a sulfurous smell. Also, comparing the sensory intensity with the amounts of volatile components showed positive significant correlations at 1 % risk between sensory intensity and three compounds: 1, 2, 4 -trithiolane, 1, 2, 4, 6 -tetrathiepane, and lenthionine. Furthermore, significant correlations at 5 % risk were obtained between the amounts of these three compounds and sensory intensity by multiple regression analysis. This showed that the smell of <b>dried</b> shiitake <b>mushrooms</b> depended on these compounds. The partial regression coefficient of 1, 2, 4 -trithiolane was larger than those of the others, and so it was proposed that 1, 2, 4 -trithiolane could serve as an indicator to estimate the smell of <b>dried</b> shiitake <b>mushroom.</b>|$|R
40|$|Aim To {{assess the}} {{usefulness}} of a DNA-based method for identifying mushroom species for application in forensic laboratory practice. Methods Two hundred twenty-one samples of clinical forensic material (<b>dried</b> <b>mushrooms,</b> food remains, stomach contents, feces, etc) were analyzed. ITS 2 region of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) was sequenced and the sequences were compared with reference sequences collected from the National Center for Biotechnology Information gene bank (GenBank). Sporological identification of mushrooms was also performed for 57 samples of clinical material. Results Of 221 samples, positive sequencing results were obtained for 152 (69 %). The highest percentage of positive results was obtained for samples of <b>dried</b> <b>mushrooms</b> (96 %) and food remains (91 %). Comparison with GenBank sequences enabled identification of all samples {{at least at the}} genus level. Most samples (90 %) were identified at the level of species or a group of closely related species. Sporological and molecular identification were consistent at the level of species or genus for 30 % of analyzed samples.
