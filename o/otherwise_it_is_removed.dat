40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} weight-based self-constructing {{clustering}} method for time series data. Self-constructing clustering processes {{all the data}} points incrementally. If a data point is not similar enough to an existing cluster, then (1) if the point currently {{does not belong to}} any cluster, it forms a new cluster of its own; (2) otherwise, the point is removed from the cluster it currently belongs to before a new cluster is formed. However, if a data point is similar enough to an existing cluster, then (1) if the point currently does not belong to any cluster, it is added to the most similar cluster; (2) <b>otherwise,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> from the cluster it currently belongs to and added to the most similar cluster. During the clustering process, weights are learned and considered in the calculations of similarity between data points and clusters. Experimental results show that our proposed approach performs more effectively than other methods for real world time series datasets...|$|E
50|$|Industrial {{microbiology}} {{can be used}} {{to produce}} antibiotics via the process of fermentation, where the source microorganism is grown in large containers (100,000-150,000 liters or more) containing a liquid growth medium. Oxygen concentration, temperature, pH and nutrient levels must be optimal, and are closely monitored and adjusted if necessary. As antibiotics are secondary metabolites, the population size must be controlled very carefully to ensure that maximum yield is obtained before the cells die. Once the process is complete, the antibiotic must be extracted and purified to a crystalline product. This is easier to achieve if the antibiotic is soluble in organic solvent. <b>Otherwise</b> <b>it</b> must first <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> by ion exchange, adsorption or chemical precipitation.|$|R
5000|$|To {{mount the}} boulder into the {{artificial}} wall the setter will {{simply have to}} screw it in with a screwdriver. Be careful not to set the screw too shallow because the boulder can be stripped if pulled hard enough. Additionally make sure the screw is not too deep <b>otherwise</b> <b>it</b> cannot <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> and has a chance of stripping the hole. Securing boulders are easy because the walls are built with holes strategically placed for common boulders to be placed. Boulders have different type of screws based on which type of boulder the company was made by. A setter must be sure to use the proper according screw and screwdriver otherwise a boulder may not be stable on the wall. Boulders can eventually be pulled off the wall over many uses and this can result in injury or death. A ladder might be required if the setter cannot reach the next desired place to screw in the boulder. The setter must mark off {{the area around the}} route that he/she is setting at because there might be loose boulders that can falls on people passing by or a climber does not accidentally climb into or around the incomplete area and possibly get hurt.|$|R
