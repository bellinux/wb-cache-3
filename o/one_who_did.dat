In his biography, Chrisye noted that he enjoyed eating at roadside foodstalls well after his marriage and would be perplexed when people stared at him. Guruh recalled that Chrisye would sleep anywhere during extended planning sessions, including under the piano.|$|E
5|$|Promoted {{to major}} on 8 June, Morshead {{distinguished}} {{himself in the}} Battle of Lone Pine on 6 August. So intense was the fighting that of the 22 officers in the battalion, Morshead was the only <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not become a casualty. However, on 16 September, like many others, he succumbed to dysentery and paratyphoid fever. He was evacuated to the 3rd General Hospital on Lemnos, and then to England on the hospital ship Aquitania, where he {{was admitted to the}} 3rd London General Hospital in Wandsworth, England. For his services in the Gallipoli campaign, he was mentioned in despatches.|$|E

5|$|The Argentine Fencing Committee {{had great}} {{difficulty}} in organizing {{a team to}} attend the 1924 Summer Olympics. Despite {{the establishment of the}} Argentine Olympic Committee, and his participation and success in all of the trials, Camet did not attend a congratulatory gala for the Olympic delegation, nor did he travel to Paris to participate in the games themselves, for personal reasons. The official report lists him {{as a member of the}} official delegation, albeit <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not participate. That year, the Argentines placed fifth in the team foil competition.

25|$|I knew Germany was in {{a terrible}} crisis; I felt {{responsible}} for German music, {{and it was my}} task to survive this crisis, as much as I could. The concern that my art was misused for propaganda had to yield to the greater concern that German music be preserved, that music be given to the German people by its own musicians. These people, the compatriots of Bach and Beethoven, of Mozart and Schubert, still had to go on living under the control of a regime obsessed with total war.

25|$|Beach {{appeared}} on {{maps of the}} time, notably that of Abraham Ortelius of 1570 and that of Jan Huygen van Linschoten of 1596, as the northernmost part of the southern continent, the Terra Australis, along with Locach. According to Marco Polo, Locach was a kingdom where gold was “so plentiful that no <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not see it could believe it”. Beach {{was in fact a}} mistranscription of Locach. Locach was Marco Polo’s name for the southern Thai kingdom of Lavo, or Lop Buri, the “city of Lavo”, (ลพบุรี, after Lavo, the son of Rama in Hindu mythology). In Chinese (Cantonese), Lavo was pronounced “Lo-huk” (羅斛), from which Marco Polo took his rendition of the name. In the German cursive script, “Locach” and “Boeach” look similar, and in the 1532 edition of Marco Polo’s Travels his Locach was changed to Boëach, later shortened to Beach.|$|E

[...] "By default, I was the only <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> it," [...] he later claimed. Bob Geldof, the organiser of Live Aid, originally asked Collins {{to be part of}} Geldof's first charity effort, Band Aid.

500|$|Josh Scherr, {{leader of}} the Drake's Fortune story {{sequence}} team, said that they created Drake as an [...] "ordinary guy" [...] with no special powers. Instead, Drake became visibly nervous at times, barely cleared objects while jumping, and stumbled while running. The characterizations were meant to show Drake as a frail character. He is not a master of hand-to-hand combat, and throws punches without style or skill. Sam Thompson, producer of Among Thieves, described Drake's martial arts abilities as [...] "fallible." [...] Sony Entertainment of America line producer Sam Thompson mused that Naughty Dog had created iconic characters before, including Crash Bandicoot. With Nathan Drake, however, the company wanted to produce a more average character, <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not possess {{the same amount of}} confidence and who was more realistic and humble.|$|E

500|$|There is much {{agreement}} among historians and analysts that Lansbury was never self-serving and, guided by his Christian socialist principles, was consistent {{in his efforts}} on behalf of the poorest in society. [...] Shepherd believes that [...] "there could have been no better leader for the Labour Party at the collapse of its political fortunes in 1931 than Lansbury, a universally popular choice and a source of inspiration among Labour ranks". In the House of Commons on 8 May 1940, the day following Lansbury's death, Chamberlain said of him: [...] "There were not many hon. Members who felt convinced of the practicability of the methods which he advocated for the preservation of peace, but there was no <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not realise his intense conviction, which arose out of his deep humanitarianism". Attlee also paid tribute to his former leader: [...] "He hated cruelty, injustice and wrongs, and felt deeply for all who suffered... e was ever the champion of the weak, and... {{to the end of his}} life he strove for that in which he believed".|$|E
500|$|Xenophon, who ends {{his history}} with the battle of Mantinea, says of the battle's results: [...] When these things had taken place, the {{opposite}} of what all men believed would happen was brought to pass. For since well-nigh all the people of Greece had come together and formed themselves in opposing lines, there was no <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not suppose that if a battle were fought, those who proved victorious would be the rulers and those who were defeated would be their subjects; but the deity so ordered it that both parties set up a trophy as though victorious and neither tried to hinder those who set them up, that both gave back the dead under a truce as though victorious, and both received back their dead under a truce as though defeated, and that while each party claimed to be victorious, neither was found to be any better off, as regards either additional territory, or city, or sway, than before the battle took place; but there was even more confusion and disorder in Greece after the battle than before.|$|E
