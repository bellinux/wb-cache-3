5|$|The ZX81 {{could be}} bought by mail order {{in kit form}} or pre-assembled. In {{what was then a}} major innovation, it was the first cheap mass-market home {{computer}} that could be bought from high street stores, led by W. H.

The ZX81's commercial success made Sinclair Research one of Britain's leading computer manufacturers and earned a fortune and an eventual knighthood for the company's founder, Sir Clive Sinclair.|$|E

5|$|The {{furniture}} store Haskins, which originated in Shepton Mallet in 1938, has its principal showroom in the High Street within Haskins Retail Centre, {{which also includes}} {{a number of others}} shops including Aldi supermarket, Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Ponden Home, Pavers Shoes and an outlet clothing store. Retail jobs in the town increased in number in 2006–7 when a new shopping development, including a large Tesco supermarket, a clothes store and <b>other</b> <b>retailers,</b> was constructed on a site just south of the town centre, which had once been a factory making Clarks shoes and later Doc Martens boots. This development attracted national media attention when protesters occupied the site to try to prevent the felling of an avenue of trees dating back to the 19th century. It has also divided opinion in the town, between those who hoped it would help to revitalise the town, and others who feared that local traders would be unable to compete, leading to a further decline of Shepton Mallet's High Street. There is also the Mulberry Factory Shop located on Kilver Street, near to the former Mulberry headquarters.|$|E
