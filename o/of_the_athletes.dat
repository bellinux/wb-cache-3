5|$|Australia has {{competed in}} every Winter Paralympics since the inaugural games in 1976. Their sole {{participant}} in 1976 was Ron Finneran, {{although he was}} not an official entrant. In 1980, alpine and cross-country skier Kyrra Grunnsund and cross-country skier Peter Rickards became the first official competitors for Australia. The number of Australian athletes increased to three, five, five and six at the next four games, respectively, and all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>athletes</b> were alpine skiers. The participation decreased to four in 1998 and climbed back up to six in 2002. Australia won its first Winter Paralympic medals in 1992, and has medalled at every games since then.

5|$|These games {{raised the}} profile of {{paraplegic}} (spinal cord and polio) athletes in Australia, particularly Western Australia. The spectator attendance amazed leading officials such as Dr Ludwig Guttmann, {{the founder of the}} Stoke Mandeville Games. He commented that the attendance was the best he had seen at any paraplegic sports event in the world. The Games highlighted the versatility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>athletes</b> with many winning medals in different sports. It was noted that generally the standard of performance was below that of the Stoke Mandeville Games; however there were several outstanding performers including Vic Renalson, Bill Mather-Brown, Lorraine Dodd, M.

5|$|Every {{participant}} at the Paralympics {{has their}} disability grouped {{into one of}} five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly {{under one of the}} other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>athletes</b> competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.|$|E
5|$|He {{ended the}} 2005 season on a {{positive}} note by winning the gold medal in the 200m at the World Athletics Final, his first major championship title. His time of 19.96s was his second fastest that year and fourth fastest of any sprinter that season. Although he stated that the quality of the competition and memories of Helsinki had made him nervous beforehand, he went on to beat all three American sprinters he had lost to in the World Championships, becoming the first athlete to beat Gatlin over 200m that season. It was not only his rival sprinters that would cause future difficulties, however, as Gay's coach Brauman was indicted for various crimes relating to his time at Barton College and the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. He had helped athletes gain funds and credits that they were not entitled to. Following Gay's testimony, the courts ruled that Brauman was guilty and, as a result, Arkansas' two NCAA titles and all of Gay's college track times were annulled. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>athletes</b> were charged with any wrongdoing. Although he was imprisoned for 10 months, Brauman continued to train Gay, periodically updating him with coaching routines and techniques.|$|E
