5|$|On 8 June 1867, Ottoman Sultan Abdülaziz {{formally}} recognized Isma'il Pasha by {{the title}} Khedive, which ranked {{higher than that}} of Vizier but lower than that of Caliph. The Khedivate of Egypt was still nominally a subject of the Ottoman Sultan, and its rulers were still technically appointed and dismissed by an imperial firman. Nevertheless, the Khedive actually exercised most sovereign powers, including the appointment of his council of ministers, the rector of Al-Azhar, and high-ranking military and naval officers. He could also sign treaties with foreign powers and borrow money for the state treasury. On 17 May 1866, the rule of succession in Egypt was changed from <b>one</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> agnatic seniority to <b>one</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> male primogeniture in the direct line of Isma'il Pasha. After the British occupied the country in 1882, the Khedive's exercise of power was limited greatly by the advice of the British agent and consul general, who became the de facto ruler of the country.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to make {{a review}} on the current {{segmentation}} algorithms used for medical images. Algorithms are classified according to their principal methodologies, namely the <b>ones</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> thresholds, the <b>ones</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> clustering techniques and the <b>ones</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> deformable models. The last type is focused on due to the intensive investigations into the deformable models {{that have been done}} in the last few decades. Typical algorithms of each type are discussed and the main ideas, application fields, advantages and disadvantages of each type are summarised. Experiments that apply these algorithms to segment the organs and tissues of the female pelvic cavity are presented to further illustrate their distinct characteristics. In the end, the main guidelines that should be considered for designing the segmentation algorithms of the pelvic cavity are proposed...|$|R

This, he suggests, is <b>one</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> interest rights.
