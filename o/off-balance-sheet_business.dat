40|$|The {{profitability}} of European banks during the 1990 s is investigated using cross-sectional, pooled cross-sectional time-series and dynamic panel models. Models for {{the determinants of}} profitability incorporate size, diversification, risk and ownership type, as well as dynamic effects. Despite intensifying competition there is significant persistence of abnormal profit from year to year. The evidence for any consistent or systematic size–profitability relationship is relatively weak. The relationship between the importance of <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>business</b> in a bank’s portfolio and profitability is positive for the UK, but either neutral or negative elsewhere. The relationship between the capital–assets ratio and profitability is positive. ...|$|E
40|$|Study of {{profitability}} {{and risk}} of agricultural banks {{is very important in}} assessing the ability to adequately finance agricultural production and rural development. A recursive system of profitability and risk equations is estimated to compare the performance of agricultural with nonagricultural banks and to identify factors which affect performance. A linear regression model which measures risk-adjusted profitability confirms the results from the recursive system. Results show that agricultural banks perform better than nonagricultural counterparts on average even after controlling for risks and other factors. Further, <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>business</b> is found to be negatively related to the risk-adjusted profitability of agricultural banks. Financial Economics,...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This paper {{combines}} a synthetic index system by the variables and evaluates China’s financial safety through {{the change of}} indexes in a comprehensive way. First of all, it builds the financial industry evaluation index system composed of 25 indicators {{in terms of the}} operation of the financial industry and external economic environment and particularly takes into consideration factors which might trigger liquidity risks such as <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>business,</b> interbank business and shadow banking; then it selects 10 indicators to conduct empirical analysis and identifies the indicator weight through principal component analysis; finally it combines the financial safety indexes through the linear weighted comprehensive evaluation model. Design/methodology/approach: Synthesis of indexes is made by constructing a proper comprehensive evaluation mathematical model, integrating a number of evaluation indexes into one comprehensive evaluation index and then obtaining corresponding comprehensive evaluation results. In this paper, it selects 10 indexes to conduct empirical analysis and identifies the index weight through principal component analysis; finally it combines the financial safety indexes through the linear weighted comprehensive evaluation model. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. PCA was invented in 1901 and was later independently developed (and named) by Harold Hotelling in the 1930 s. Findings: From 2003 to 2013 China’s financial safety indexes fluctuated. From 2003 to 2007 indexes rose, which indicates China’s financial safety status gradually improved; from 2007 to 2009 indexes declined, which indicates due to the impact of subprime crisis, China’s financial safety status took a turn for the worse; from 2009 to 2012 indexes rose, which indicates the external environment improved so did China’s financial safety status; from 2012 to 2013 indexes declined because due to the rapid development of banks’ financial products and trust products, banks’ off-balance-sheet assets and liquidity risks increased. The changes of financial safety indexes are generally identical with those of China’s financial safety status. Research limitations/implications: In the empirical analysis part, this article tries to selective 24 indicators synthetic index of China's financial security, but due to some of the indicators data acquisition is relatively difficult, can only Selective 10 of 25 indicators and gather the annual data of 10 indicators from 2003 to 2013 to synthetic index. The information of eliminated indicators cannot be reflected in the index. Index change also does not reflect of the risk from these indicators. In order {{to make up for the}} above limitations, this paper is mainly to introduce and analysis our latest financial institutions business trends associated with these eliminated indicators to get the conclusions more reliable. Originality/value: The aim of this research is to estimate financial safety of China with the application of the index of financial safety of a country using the annual data of 2003 - 2013. Through synthetic index of financial security measure the risks of China's financial system, provide the basis for the government macro financial policy. The Originality of the paper is mainly manifested in incorporating factors which have made important impacts on China’s financial safety in recent years, but have not been taken into consideration in the existing studies into the newly constructed financial safety index system. For example, some factors that cannot be controlled easily might have huge hidden risk hazards. To be more specific, factors such as <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>business,</b> interbank business and shadow banking might trigger liquidity risks. In this way, the research results will be more practical. </p...|$|E

40|$|From American {{subprime}} crisis to European debt crisis, {{the problem of}} liquidity risk in commercial banks is never out of the public’s sight. At each financial crisis, banks {{are the first to}} get into a dilemma. Due to the implicit government guarantee and a macro-economic liquidity surplus, Chinese banking system has experienced {{a relatively small number of}} bankruptcy and liquidity crises, which makes it not urgent to manage liquidity risk. However, the 2013 June Currency Shortage in China exposes the severe potential liquidity difficulties. Therefore, this dissertation aims to study current status of liquidity risk and liquidity risk management in Chinese banking system in the post-crisis era. Through the analysis of a series of static indicators, such as the non-performing loan ratio, the loan-to-deposit ratio and the liquidity ratio, it is believed that Chinese commercial banks are still in a condition of excessive liquidity. However, under the influences of new features in financial operation, such as financial disintermediation, inter-bank transaction and <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>business,</b> the liquidity risk exposure in Chinese commercial banks enlarges. Additionally, through empirical study of determinants of the liquidity risk in Chinese commercial banks, it can be estimated that the liquidity risk in Chinese commercial banks is generally under greater role by internal factors than by external ones. Banks’ asset size and profitability replenish the liquidity to withstand risks, while higher equity-to-assets ratio and non-performing loan ratio intensify the risk exposure. Banks which have implemented Basel III standards face less likelihood of liquidity risk exposure than banks which have not implemented. After analysing the differences between Basel III and Chinese regulatory rules and differences in the liquidity risk management modes between other countries and China, it can be concluded that the diversified, hierarchical and elaborated tendency of liquidity risk management and regulation in China is necessary.
