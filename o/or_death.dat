40|$|Parental <b>or</b> {{caregiver}} <b>death,</b> {{especially in}} childhood, can have long lasting emotional ramifications in an individual's life. When this early loss {{is followed by}} significant life events such as pregnancy, and losses such as miscarriage, the bereaved woman experiences considerable emotional impact. The present study explores the relationship between parental <b>or</b> caregiver <b>death</b> and miscarriage on depressive symptoms and grief. Specifically, the study examines whether a history of parental <b>or</b> caregiver <b>death</b> affects depressive symptoms and grief following miscarriage such that miscarrying women with parental <b>or</b> caregiver <b>death</b> {{have higher levels of}} depressive symptoms and grief than their counterparts who have not experienced parental <b>or</b> caregiver <b>death.</b> The study further examines whether the difference in the level of depressive symptoms between miscarrying women with and without a history of parental <b>or</b> caregiver <b>death</b> is greater than the difference in the level of depressive symptoms between pregnant and non-pregnant/community women with and without a history of parental <b>or</b> caregiver <b>death.</b> Results indicate that miscarrying women who have suffered parental <b>or</b> caregiver <b>death</b> experience more depressive symptoms than miscarrying women who have not suffered parental or caregiver death; pregnant women who have suffered parental <b>or</b> caregiver <b>death</b> prior to age eighteen experience more depressive symptoms than pregnant women who have not suffered parental <b>or</b> caregiver <b>death</b> prior to age eighteen. However, the difference in the level of depressive symptoms in miscarrying women with and without as history of parental <b>or</b> caregiver <b>death</b> is not greater than the difference in the level of depressive symptoms in pregnant and non-pregnant/community women with and without a history of parental <b>or</b> caregiver <b>death.</b> No association was found between parental <b>or</b> caregiver <b>death</b> and grief in miscarrying women. Results are discussed in the context of psychodynamic, relational, and attachment-based explanatory models...|$|R
