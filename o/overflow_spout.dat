50|$|Back {{siphonage}} may {{be prevented}} {{by use of}} a vertical air gap. This may be a small gap, such as provided by a tundish (a combined <b>overflow</b> <b>spout</b> and catch funnel) or a large gap, such as a basin tap being above the maximum level {{of the water in}} the basin. Standards for these air gaps group them by the amount of separation that they provide and their acceptability for the various risk categories. The size of the acceptable gap also depends on the capacity of the incoming supply, such that a stuck-open flow cannot overfill the cistern and close the gap.|$|E
40|$|A new {{technique}} for measuring hand volumes using Archimedes principle is described. The technique involves the immersion {{of a hand}} in a water container placed on an electronic balance. The volume is given by the change in weight divided by the density of water. This technique was compared with the more conventional technique of immersing an object in a container with an <b>overflow</b> <b>spout</b> and collecting and weighing the volume of overflow water. The hand volume of two subjects was measured. Hand volumes were 494 ± 6 ml and 312 ± 7 ml for the immersion method and 476 ± 14 ml and 302 ± 8 ml for the overflow method for the two subjects respectively. Using plastic test objects, the mean difference between the actual and measured volume was - 0. 3...|$|E
40|$|A little-known {{method of}} {{measuring}} {{the volume of}} small objects based on Archimedes principle is described, which involves suspending an object in a water-filled container placed on electronic scales. The suspension technique is {{a variation on the}} hydrostatic weighing technique used for measuring volume. The suspension method was compared with two other traditional water displacement methods of measuring volume – i. e. placing an object in a measuring cylinder and recording the rise in the water level and immersing the object in a water-filled container with an <b>overflow</b> <b>spout</b> to record the volume of overflow. The accuracy and precision of the three methods was compared using 10 accurately machined PVC cylinders ranging in volume from 1. 5 to 15. 7 ml. The mean difference between the actual and measured volumes was 3. 3 +/- 7. 3 %, - 1. 6 +/- 7. 2 % and 0. 03 +/- 0. 45 %, for the level, overflow and suspension methods respectively. Each measurement was repeated twice to obtain the reproducibility of the three displacement techniques. The reproducibility was – 1. 7 +/- 8. 5 %, 0. 09 +/- 3 % and – 0. 04 +/- 0. 43 % for the level, overflow and suspension techniques respectively. The results show that the suspension technique is more accurate and precise than the traditional water displacement methods and is more accurate than measuring volume using Vernier calliper measurements...|$|E

The mimic royalty on the stage, with their soaked satins clinging to their bodies, slopped about ankle-deep in water, warbling their sweetest and best, the fiddlers under the eaves {{of the stage}} sawed away for dear life, with the cold <b>overflow</b> <b>spouting</b> down {{the backs of their}} necks, and the dry and happy King sat in his lofty box and wore his gloves to ribbons applauding.|$|R

Ah, those {{wonderful}} words that begin with E: In their early lives, enthusiastic meant 2 ̆ 2 possessed by a god, 2 ̆ 2 enchanted 2 ̆ 2 singing a magic song, 2 ̆ 2 ecstatic 2 ̆ 2 in a trance, exhilarated 2 ̆ 2 made thoroughly cheerful, 2 ̆ 2 exhuberant, and ebullient and effervescent, 2 ̆ 2 <b>overflowing,</b> boiling over, <b>spouting</b> out. 2 ̆ 2 E {{is truly a}} godlike letter that magically entrances, cheers our spirits, and bubbles over...|$|R
5000|$|Primarily made of concrete, {{the water}} flows from two terrace fountains and reappears in [...] "three columns {{of water and}} two shell spills in five niches which {{are located in the}} face of terrace {{retaining}} wall." [...] After entering the niches, the water moves from two basins and two more <b>spout</b> <b>overflows,</b> and then into a series of thirteen graduated cascade basins that enter into large pools. The large pools feature four grotesque spouting masks, four urn jets, two dolphin sprays, and eight white water jets that help to refresh the water of the pool. The 16th Street side of the fountain has more niches and shell overflows and a recirculation room is in the control room under the great wall. Landscaping and walkways flank the fountain on both sides.|$|R
