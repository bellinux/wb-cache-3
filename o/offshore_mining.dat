500|$|The mission had {{previously}} been attempted over the night of 11/12 September 1942, but had to be cancelled after the MTB arrived {{off the coast of}} France. The raiding party had been unable to locate their target because of the dark and foggy conditions. On 12 September 1942, their MTB left Portsmouth at 20:12 and reached the coast off Barfleur at about 22:00. Moving at a reduced speed to avoid detection and avoid the <b>offshore</b> <b>mine</b> fields, they reached their intended position offshore just after midnight on 13 September 1942. Observing the coastline, in the dark they incorrectly identified a valley which they believed was St Honorine, but was actually Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer, about one mile to the right of their intended target. At around 00:20 hours the landing party headed toward the beach in a small collapsible flat bottomed boat known as a Goatley boat. After reaching the shore they realised they were too close to some houses to leave their boat where it was. They dragged the boat [...] east away from the houses and above the high water mark.

40|$|AbstractPT Timah (Persero), Tbk {{operates}} inland and <b>offshore</b> <b>mining</b> {{to achieve}} their annual production targets. In 2009, 2010, and 2011, {{there was a difference}} in tin production between inland and <b>offshore</b> <b>mining.</b> It was caused by the differences in equipment operating costs and productivity between the mining methods. From an economical and technical aspect, the amount of inland and <b>offshore</b> <b>mining</b> to produce can be determined to achieve maximum profit. To determine this proportion of tin production in 2012 - 2015, optimization based on the law of diminishing return was used. Optimal inland mining production was approached using the production in the Nudur 3 and Nudur 4 mines, whereas for <b>offshore</b> <b>mining,</b> production was approached using the production using dredgers. Production cost is calculated based on the equipments used, while the selling price is counted based on the break-even point between revenue and cost. Linear programming is used to determine the optimal production of tin ore in inland and <b>offshore</b> <b>mining.</b> The total value of NPV for the period of 2012 – 2015 is $ 367. 384. 870, comes yearly from the proportion of inland and <b>offshore</b> <b>mining</b> production of 17. 145 tons and 17. 308 tons respectively...|$|E

40|$|Rationale - Increasing world {{population}} and consumption, and rising dependency on certain countries for {{the supply of}} raw materials lead to the demand for new raw material resources. This demand, combined {{with the increase in}} complexity of new land-based mining operations increases the chances for a viable <b>offshore</b> <b>mining</b> business case. Goal and scope - The aim of this research is twofold. The first aim is to fill knowledge gaps in the <b>offshore</b> <b>mining</b> value chain, with a focus on the processing of the mined material. The second goal is to assess if shallow water <b>offshore</b> <b>mining</b> is a viable business option. Explicitly left out of scope are the exploration for mineral deposits as well as the detailed or new design of an extraction method for subsea minerals. Furthermore, resources beyond the continental plate are not part of this research. Approach - To answer the first goal of this research, an extensive literature study is performed comprising an assessment of potential offshore mineable minerals and their respective markets. It also included an analysis of current land-based mineral processing techniques and its limitations in an offshore environment. Furthermore environmental, legislative and tax aspects were included as well as detailed descriptions of future <b>offshore</b> <b>mining</b> projects, and current dredge mining projects. To assess the viability of an <b>offshore</b> <b>mining</b> project, a case study is set-up of a prospective <b>offshore</b> <b>mining</b> project. A method for executing the case study is developed. Results of the case study - For the case study the mineral deposit has been studied and based on its mineral characteristics a location specific processing flow sheet is developed. The case study resulted in a set of execution alternatives, from which a preferred option was selected. Based on this option the viability of the project is assessed {{with the use of a}} discounted cash flow method (DCF-method). Conclusions - Main knowledge gaps are identified as the impact on the environment, and the lack of legislation regarding <b>offshore</b> <b>mining.</b> Furthermore, it should be noted, that the public opinion regarding <b>offshore</b> <b>mining</b> is important to consider as well. This project was done in cooperation with Van Oord Dredging and Marine contractors, therefore any company specific information is not taken into account in this public report...|$|E

40|$|The phylum-level {{meta-analysis}} {{approach has}} been proposed {{as a way of}} comparing geographically different areas along a common scale of disturbance. However, the training data set which establishes the scale of disturbance and all subsequent studies using the approach have been exposed to some sort of organic or inorganic pollution. Using macrobenthic communities subjected to a short-lived but intense physical disturbance from <b>offshore</b> <b>mining</b> off the west coast of Southern Africa, we tested the applicability of the meta-analysis approach for assessing the severity of disturbance in physically disturbed communities. The positioning of the original data set along a primary axis of disturbance was maintained; however, a second significant separation, along the vertical axis, distinguishes between macrobenthic assemblages from southern Africa and the NE Atlantic Shelf. The southern African samples are characterised by a larger proportion of Crustacea, {{and in the case of}} mined samples Mollusca, whereas the NE Atlantic data contain relatively more Echinodermata in the unpolluted samples and are dominated by Annelida in the organically enriched areas. The proportion of annelids decreased by about 50 % in mined areas compared to the non-mined areas and the NE Atlantic samples. Conversely, bivalves and gastropods exhibited a notable increase in proportion in the mined patches compared to the adjacent non-mined areas, possibly as a result of their preferential ability to survive the mining process or their better ability to recolonise after mining, or an interplay of both factors. The mining activity may result in the selection of species for their physical robustness and tolerance to mining rather than their resistance to pollution in the conventional sense. The failure of the meta-analysis to ordinate the mined samples along the primary horizontal axis of disturbance, as defined by Warwick & Clarke¹s original study (Mar Ecol Prog Ser 92 : 221 - 231), does not reflect a failure of the meta-analysis to detect disturbance, but rather shows that the primary axis is strongly determined by the opportunistic species characteristic of organically enriched areas. It appears that phylum-level meta-analysis is better suited to assessing the impact of organic and chemical pollution on an ocean-basin scale than it is to physical disturbance caused by <b>offshore</b> <b>mining...</b>|$|E

Knowledge of the ocean—globally and {{especially}} in our coastal areas—is demanded by many constituencies, including climatologists, fishermen and fisheries managers, harbor pilots, coastal zone managers, Navy and Coast Guard commanders, Public Health Service officers, environmental protection professionals, commercial and recreational boat and ship operators, weather forecasters, and the <b>offshore</b> <b>mining</b> and oil industry.
