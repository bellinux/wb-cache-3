40|$|There are {{now many}} {{educational}} organizations {{and institutions that}} are strategically moving to adopt flexible delivery and on-line learning. The factors that have influenced these moves are typically based on such imperatives as the need to deliver programs more efficiently, the desire to provide more flexible programs for existing students and the opportunities on-line settings provide for creating new markets. But the <b>on-line</b> <b>delivery</b> of programs offers potentially far more than these outcomes alone. Online delivery supports and encourages very powerful learning environments and has the prospect to transform education if approached in the correct fashion. It would not be unfair to say that most forms of <b>on-line</b> <b>delivery,</b> across all sectors of education throughout the world, tend not to be that impressive when viewed from a learning perspective. The bulk of online units tend to be based around very narrow instructional design models and tend to be testament to the economic, efficiency and marketing imperatives on which they are based.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the impact that proctored versus un-proctored testing would have on {{learning}} for an on-line content module; and examine the relationship between LASSI variables and learning. A randomized, pre-test/post-test control group design was employed. College students in a pharmacy curriculum, were randomized to two groups utilizing asynchronous, on-line content with a medical terminology module. Group A utilized proctored, on-line testing, while Group B utilized un-proctored on-line testing. Both were given a pre-test and post-test on medical terminology at the beginning and end of a sixteen week semester. The Learning and Study Strategies Inventory was administered to all students. <b>On-line</b> module <b>delivery</b> paired with proctored testing was more effective in promoting learning when compared to <b>on-line</b> module <b>delivery</b> paired with un-proctored testing. The constructs: anxiety, self-testing, attitude/interest and motivation were significant in predicting learning for proctored students. No significant model emerged for un-proctored students.

The subjective methodology aimed at eliciting students personal opinions on the effectiveness of the on-line instruction. The objective methodology aimed at establishing instructional effectiveness that is removed from personal opinions by contacting a statistical analysis comparing the final grade distributions of two sets of students that attended the same computer science content, one using the <b>on-line</b> <b>delivery</b> method and the other using the in-class delivery.

40|$|The current {{research}} revealed a disordinal aptitude-treatment interaction between learning style and mode of training. Over {{the course of}} several tutorials, 157 students were randomly allocated to one of the two teaching methods: face-to-face or on-line. At the end of the tutorial, students' learning was assessed using a short multiple-choice test and their learning style determined via Honey and Mumford's Learning Style Inventory. Results showed that more interactive learners (Activists and Pragmatists) performed better in the face-to-face condition compared to the on-line condition, whereas more independent learners (Theorists and Reflectors) performed better in the on-line condition compared to the face-to-face condition. This result suggests a psychological reason why <b>on-line</b> <b>delivery</b> of material has not superseded traditional face-to-face teaching methods, as prophesised by some commentators during the 1990 's.

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} explore the appropriateness of <b>on-line</b> training <b>delivery</b> methods for small business owner/managers.

Not surprisingly then, encouraging {{the development of the}} skills of the workforce has emerged as a major priority for government policy. However, what is also recognised is that many small business owner/managers (SBOs) have limited e-competencies. Results of this research confirmed this and also demonstrated that SBOs have a poor understanding of the concept of on-line training.

A close understanding of the relationship between user confidence and information presentation can suggest new design principles to support them in making informed choices about when and how to disclose personal information.

40|$|<b>On-line</b> service <b>delivery</b> {{undertaken}} between {{clients and}} service providers often incurs risks {{for both the}} client and the provider, especially when such an exchange {{takes place in the}} context of an electronic service market. For the client, the risk involves determining whether the requested service will be delivered on time and based on the previously agreed Service Level Agreement (SLA). Often risk to the client can be mitigated through the use of a penalty clause in an SLA. For the provider, the risk revolves around ensuring that the client will pay the advertised price and more importantly whether the provider will be able to deliver the advertised service to not incur the penalty identified in the SLA. This becomes more significant when the service providers outsource the actual enactment/execution to a data centre – a trend that has become dominant in recent years, with the emergence of infrastructure providers such as Amazon. com. In this work we investigate the notion of “risk” from a variety of different perspectives and demonstrate how risk to a service owner (who uses an external, third party data centre for service hosting) can be managed more effectively. A simulation based approach is used to validate our findings...|$|R
40|$|Error {{resilient}} audio coding is {{an essential}} enabling technology for <b>on-line</b> music <b>delivery</b> in wireless networks. Three crucial requirements for the transmission of audio over mobile networks are compression efficiency, computational simplicity and error resilience. This dissertation concentrates {{on the development of}} novel solutions in these three areas. The first contribution of this dissertation is the development of an equivalent rectangular band (ERB) based masking model and its incorporation into an audio encoder. Most currently employed psychoacoustic models are based on the Bark frequency scale. The proposed model enables performance comparison of models based on ERB and Bark scales. The investigation reported in this dissertation has shown that ERB based masking models work at least as well as the Bark based models. They improve the relatively poor performance of current perceptual audio coding technology when applied to speech signals at very low bitrates. Superior performance of the new model with speech signals may also suggest that models based on the Bark scale may have introduced distortions at frequencies below 500 Hz, although this does not necessarily reduce speech intelligibility. Additionally it is shown how excess masking can be exploited to further improve coding efficiency in systems using perceptual models based on the ERB scale...|$|R
