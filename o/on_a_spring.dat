Stephen Hawking has shown up to see what the Mensa group is up to and makes it clear he is unimpressed; however, he saves Lisa from being seriously injured by the angry townspeople. In the end, Hawking and Homer meet at Moe's Tavern for a drink.

25|$|In 1782, Arnold {{took out}} another patent {{to protect the}} latest and most {{important}} inventions, which were potentially lucrative. Several other watchmakers, most notably Thomas Earnshaw, had started to copy Arnold's work. Around 1780, Earnshaw modifyied his detent escapement by mounting the detent <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>spring</b> to create the spring detent escapement.|$|E

25|$|In 1780, {{while making}} these {{chronometers}} for Brockbank, Earnshaw modified the pivoted detent by mounting the locking piece <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>spring,</b> thus dispensing with the pivots. Arnold managed {{to see this}} new idea and promptly took out the 1782 patent for his own design of spring detent, {{but it is not}} known whether this preceded Earnshaw's own idea.|$|E
25|$|The dipole {{oscillator}} {{consists of}} a simple harmonic oscillator, which is {{thought of as a}} charged particle <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>spring,</b> perturbed by an external force, like an external charge. The motion of the oscillating charge can be expressed as a Fourier series in the frequency of the oscillator. Heisenberg solved for the quantum behavior by two different methods. First, he treated the system with the virtual oscillator method, calculating the transitions between the levels that would be produced by the external source.|$|E
25|$|The {{technical}} {{rules for the}} Japanese version of men's rhythmic gymnastics came around the 1970s. For individuals, only four types of apparatus are used: the double rings, the stick, the rope, and the clubs. Groups do not use any apparatus. The Japanese version includes tumbling performed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>spring</b> floor. Points are awarded based a 10-point scale that measures {{the level of difficulty}} of the tumbling and apparatus handling. On November 27–29, 2003, Japan hosted first edition of the Men's Rhythmic Gymnastics World Championship.|$|E

25|$|A simple {{seismometer}} that {{is sensitive}} to up-down motions of the earth can be understood by visualizing a weight hanging <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>spring.</b> The spring and weight are suspended from a frame that moves along with the earthʼs surface. As the earth moves, the relative motion between the weight and the earth provides {{a measure of the}} vertical ground motion. If a recording system is installed, such as a rotating drum attached to the frame, and a pen attached to the mass, this relative motion between the weight and earth can be recorded to produce a history of ground motion, called a seismogram.|$|E
25|$|Paramore then {{played a}} sold out 15-date European tour with You Me At Six, Paper Route and Now Now Every Children. Their stadium tour culminated at London's Wembley Arena, to an {{audience}} of 12,500. The band performed in 2010 in the Australian Soundwave Festival along with bands such as Faith No More, Placebo, You Me at Six, All Time Low, Jimmy Eat World and Taking Back Sunday. Shortly before the tour, lead guitarist Josh Farro announced via the band's LiveJournal that he was engaged and stayed behind to plan his wedding. Justin York, brother of Taylor York, filled in for him on the tour. The band, with Farro returned, embarked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>spring</b> tour of the U.S. in late April. Paramore supported Green Day on selected dates of their Stadium tour, in Dublin and Paris.|$|E
500|$|In 1930, while laid up with {{a sprained}} leg, Brooks {{began a series of}} more than 100 {{drawings}} of humans, angels, demons, animals, and monsters, all formed out of continuous curved lines.

[...] Davidson notes that in Landnámabók, this is recorded as a recognized method for a woman to claim land, and the work further details that [...] "she might not possess more than she could encircle in this way between sunrise and sunset <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>spring</b> day." [...] Davidson comments that [...] "this sounds like a ritual taking over of land rather than a legal requirement, like the custom of men lighting fires when taking new land, and {{it is possible that the}} women's custom was linked with the fertility goddess." [...] In addition, Davidson notes that Zealand is the most fertile region of Denmark.|$|E

The {{decision by}} the Supreme War Council was given increased impetus for [...] "Allied activity" [...] on 8 March when the Russian Revolution began. By 11 March Baghdad in Mesopotamia had been occupied by British Empire forces, and an offensive in Macedonia had been launched. In April the Battle of Arras was launched by the British, and the French launched the Nivelle offensive. Britain's three major war objectives now were to maintain maritime supremacy in the Mediterranean Sea, while preserving {{the balance of power}} in Europe and the security of Egypt, India, and the Persian Gulf. The latter could be secured by an advance into Palestine and the capture of Jerusalem. A further advance would ultimately cut off the Ottoman forces in Mesopotamia from those on the Arabian Peninsula and secure the region.|$|E

2500|$|Around a {{thousand}} poems attributed to him are extant. His poems {{have been collected}} into the most important Tang dynasty poetry anthology Heyue yingling ji, compiled in 753 by Yin Fan, and thirty-four of his poems {{are included in the}} anthology Three Hundred Tang Poems, which was first published in the 18th century. In the same century, translations of his poems began to appear in Europe. The poems were models for celebrating the pleasures of friendship, the depth of nature, solitude, and the joys of drinking wine. Among the most famous are [...] "Waking from Drunkenness <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Spring</b> Day", [...] "The Hard Road to Shu", and [...] "Quiet Night Thought", which still appear in school texts in China. In the West, multi-lingual translations of Li's poems continue to be made. His life has even taken on a legendary aspect, including tales of drunkenness, chivalry, and the well-known fable that Li drowned when he reached from his boat to grasp the moon’s reflection in the river.|$|E
2500|$|Men's rhythmic {{gymnastics}} in Japan {{was originally}} created by adopting elements from Swedish, Danish, and German gymnastics. It has been taught and performed {{for many years}} {{with the aim of}} improving physical strength and health as early as the 1940s. Originally, both boys and girls used to perform this type of gymnastics, which is called [...] "Dantai Toshu Taisou", literally [...] "group freehand gymnastics". In 1967, the name [...] "Shintaisou" [...] ("new gymnastics") was adopted as a translation of [...] "Modern Gymnastics," [...] which used to be done in Northern and Central Europe. On the other hand, rhythmic gymnastics for women has also been called [...] "Shintaisou" [...] in Japan since it was first imported to the country. Currently, MRG and women's rhythmic gymnastics are both under the umbrella of Japan Gymnastics Association and major competitions are often held at the same venue. Men's RG consists of two types of events: group events of 6 people (freehand or no apparatus) and individual events using apparatus (stick, rings, rope and clubs). Both group and individual events are performed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>spring</b> floor, allowing gymnasts to do various kinds of tumbling during their performance.|$|E
2500|$|Booby-traps were devised with delayed-action fuzes used a striker <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>spring,</b> {{held back}} by a wire. Acid ate through the wire, to release the striker and {{detonate}} the explosive. A number of devices with such fuzes were planted in bunkers but most booby-traps had simple pressure detonators. Wires were attached to useful items like stove chimneys and loot; trip-wires on the stairs of dugouts were connected to bundles of hand-grenades. On some roads, heavy-artillery shells were buried with contact-fuzes, which would only be triggered {{by the weight of}} a lorry. British engineers and tunnelling companies scoured areas as they were occupied and disabled many of the explosives. Roads were flooded by destroying drains and water-courses; wells sabotaged by drilling a shaft next to them and exploding a charge, permanently ruining the well. Much of the explosive used by the Germans (Donarit, Westphalite and Perdit) had the property of water-absorption so could be neutralised by dousing. Some British booby-trap patrols made German prisoners go first, who revealed traps rather than be blown up and British tunnellers removed [...] of explosives. (In some areas no booby-traps were found, as German divisional commanders had been allowed to choose whether to mine their areas and some refused.) ...|$|E
