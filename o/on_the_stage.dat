This might be counter-intuitive, because z_ 2 indicated a total reduction in transport costs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second <b>stage.</b> <b>The</b> {{reason for this is}} that the buy-to-fly ratio α leads to significantly stronger reduction in <b>the</b> required tkm <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first <b>stage.</b> Especially for α = 2, the quantile range is very broad (see Fig.  6). Compared to α = 20, the share of tkm for α = 2 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second <b>stage</b> is over three times higher.|$|R

The piece did not return to Broadway until 2002, when a version with a plot by playwright David Henry Hwang (but retaining most of the original songs) was presented after a successful Los Angeles run. Hwang's story retains the Chinatown setting and the inter-generational and immigrant themes, and emphasizes the romantic relationships. It received mostly poor reviews in New York and closed after six months but had a short tour and has since been produced regionally.|$|E
