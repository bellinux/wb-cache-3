40|$|Abstract—Silicone oil has {{merits of}} less {{flammability}} and excellent environment-friendliness. High-viscosity silicone oil of 50 cSt {{has been widely}} applied to power and distribution transformers. Recently, application of low-viscosity silicone oil of 20 cSt to transformers has been considered for its excellent cooling performance. Detection of incipient fault conditions in low-viscosity silicone <b>oil</b> <b>immersed</b> transformers becomes more important when they are operated in electric power systems. Detection of certain gases generated in a transformer is usually the useful indication of an abnormal condition. To clarify its applicability to a low-viscosity silicone <b>oil</b> <b>immersed</b> transformer, this paper described gas characteristics generated by electrical discharges in detail. It was clarified that the identification of abnormal conditions are possible by considering the amounts and types of generated gases. Finally, gas characteristics were compared with those in 50 cSt silicone oil and mineral oil...|$|E

50|$|The {{immersion}} method {{is used for}} the processing of manganese phosphate coatings. The steps of immersion include degreasing/cleaning, water rinses, pickling in mineral acid, activation, manganese phosphating, an optional final drying, and lubrication using oils or emulsion. The first step of this method is to degrease and clean, typically with strong alkaline cleaners. Pickling in mineral acid is a useful process described by the removal of oxide, resulting in a clean surface. The water pre-rinse activation allows the cleaning and pickling to take place while avoiding the formation of coarse-crystalline phosphate. Manganese phosphating is performed, typically in a bath of dilute phosphoric acid that is at approximately 95˚C for about 5-20 minutes (the time varies with the state of the surface being coated). The elements that were coated are then allowed to dry, possibly in an oven. The final step of manganese phosphate coating is to lubricate the materials with <b>oil</b> by <b>immersing</b> them in the oil bath and then letting them drain. This results in different thicknesses of oil when different concentrations and types of oil are used.|$|R

The robust diamond surface allows pore filling, cleaning, and reuse without {{damage to the}} electrode surface. The electrode is immersed into aqueous electrolyte media, and voltammetric responses for the oxidation of DDPD are obtained. In order to further improve the current responses, 20 wt% of carbon nanofibers are co-deposited with the oil into the pore array.

40|$|This paper proposes {{the use of}} a {{narrowband}} {{high frequency}} based distributed transformer model for estimating partial discharge location within the winding of an interleaved power transformer.

The technique proposed here takes advantage of the high frequency nature of a partial discharge and requires measurement at one location only.

Here a narrow band of frequencies within the frequency {{response of the}} system, that exhibit resonant pole behavior, is specifically targeted. It is proposed that the observed response {{is due to the}} interaction of residual winding inductance with capacitance to ground. This physical phenomenon is inherently distributed; hence regions within the frequency response related to this interaction will be dependent upon the input location. With this premise an algorithm that estimates the location of the partial discharge by iteratively comparing the proposed model at various locations within the winding with the observed partial discharge frequency response is implemented.

40|$|Solvent {{injection}} {{has been}} considered as an efficient method for enhancing oil recovery from fractured reservoirs. If the mass transfer would be solely based on diffusion, oil recovery would be unacceptably slow. The success of this method therefore depends {{on the degree of}} enhancement of the mass exchange rate between the solvent residing in the fracture and the oil residing in the matrix. A series of soak experiments have been conducted to investigate the mass transfer rate between the fracture and the matrix. In a soak experiment, a porous medium containing <b>oil</b> is <b>immersed</b> in an open space containing the solvent to simulate the matrix and the fracture respectively. We use a CT scanner to visualize the process. The experimental data are compared with a simulation model that takes diffusive and gravitational forces into account. We find that the initial stage of all experiments can be described by a diffusion-based model with an enhanced effective diffusion coefficient. In the second stage enhancement of the transfer rate occurs due to the natural convection of solvent in the fracture. The experiments are quantitatively modeled by numerical simulations. We find that transfer rates depend on the properties of the rock permeability, the viscosity and the density of solvent and oil. The gravity enhanced transfer is quantified by comparison of experimental and simulated results. Section Petroleum EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|Recently AFM {{has been}} used to measure the {{interactions}} in aqueous media between a deformable oil drop attached onto an AFM cantilever and another drop on a substrate. In this study this method has been applied to <b>oil</b> droplets <b>immersed</b> in a solution of a polysaccharide extract having emulsifying properties, sugar beet pectin (SBP). In parallel with the force spectroscopy studies, images of the SBP interfacial films were obtained, in order to probe the effects of interfacial structures on the interactions between the drops. The influence of the SBP concentration in the bulk phase was studied: at a low bulk SBP concentration, where the adsorbed SBP layer is relatively flat, non-adsorbed SBP in the bulk solution gives rise to a depletion interaction between the drops. Upon increasing the SBP concentration, a hysteresis appears in the interactions between the drops. It is hypothesised that this effect is induced by the strong liquid structural correlations occurring within the liquid film separating the droplets. This conjecture is supported by a theoretical description which incorporates depletion interactions into a model for the interactions between deformable droplets. At high SBP concentration a strong repulsive force, attributed to steric repulsion between the thick SBP layers adsorbed onto the drops, is observed. Under different bulk conditions polymer bridges were observed to be formed between the SBP-coated droplets. The results demonstrate how AFM can be used to probe different types of interactions between deformable oil drops in aqueous media at the molecular level. When combined with theoretical models, this approach will advance the understanding of molecular mechanisms that govern the stability of emulsions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract − Assessment {{of power}} {{transformer}} condition {{is very important}} for utilities, to ensure continuous power transmission and power supply. Therefore, different techniques are used for condition assessment, as off-line diagnostics and on-line monitoring. The off-line diagnostics has some time period between consecutive diagnoses, and during that period the condition is unknown.

40|$|Abstract—A novel {{wireless}} less-invasive implantable {{blood pressure}} sensing system is proposed for advanced biological research. The system employs a miniature instrumented elastic cuff, {{wrapped around a}} blood vessel, for small animal real-time blood pressure monitoring. The elastic cuff is made of bio-compatible soft silicone material by a molding process and is filled with bio-compatible insulating silicone <b>oil</b> with an <b>immersed</b> MEMS capacitive pressure sensor interfaced with low power integrated electronics. This technique avoids vessel penetration and substantially minimizes vessel restriction due to the soft cuff elasticity, thus attractive for long-term implant. The MEMS pressure sensor detects the coupled blood pressure waveform caused by the vessel expansion and contraction, followed by amplification, digitization, and wireless FSK data transmission to an external receiver. The integrated electronics are designed with capability of receiving RF power from an external power source and converting the RF signal to a stable 2 V DC supply in an adaptive manner to power the overall implant system, thus enabling a realization of stand-alone battery-less implant microsystem.

The comparison {{is based on the}} minimumTOC. This is achieved through a field-validated distribution transformer design program that automatically minimises the objective function (TOC). In particular, 12 oil-immersed distribution transformers are designed: 6 three-phase transformer banks and 6 three-phase transformers; these designs meet all the requirements of a given transformer standard. As a result, curves of minimum TOC versus transformer rating are obtained for three-phase transformer banks and three-phase transformers. Moreover, similar curves from seven transformer manufacturers are collected; the advantage of this collection is that these different manufacturers have different types of transformers: <b>oil</b> <b>immersed</b> or dry type, core or shell type, various voltage classes and power ratings, and so on, and consequently more general conclusions can be drawn regarding the comparison of three-phase transformer banks and three-phase transformers. From these investigations, it was found that from the view-point of minimum total mass and minimum TOC, three-phase transformer banks should be recommended in case of small-size transformers (rating lower than 45 kVA).

The technique has been used in experiments with spherical electrodes and rounded edge plane electrodes, each pair having an insulation barrier between them.

Because the CFC solvents have been implicated in stratospheric ozone depletion, AT&T has developed a policy that calls for a 50 % reduction in emissions by 1991 with eventual discontinuation of emissions in manufacturing processes by 1994. To comply with the corporate goals, alternative methods of metal cleaning must be developed. These methods may involve cleaning techniques that do not depend upon CFCs or processes that do not result in contaminated parts. Previous to this work, CFC- 113 was used in the production of circuit board backplane pins in Kansas City. The incoming rolls of CA 725 metal (Cu/ Ni/Sn) alloy were lubricated with machining <b>oils,</b> stamped and <b>immersed</b> in an ultrasonically agitated CFC- 1 13 bath to remove residual oil in a continuous reel-to-reel operation. The reels of stamped metal were then inspected for physical imperfections, stored for a variable period and sent to the plating shop as needed. The first step in the plating process, also a reel-to-reel operation, was immersion in a caustic cleaning bath to remove residual oil left from the CFC- 113 process and subsequent contaminants from the inspection procedures and storage period prior to plating. The parts were rinsed, immersed in an acidic solution for preplate activation, plated with the appropriate metals and finally coated with insertion oil. Cleanliness is very im...|$|R
40|$|The {{yield and}} {{chemical}} composition of essential oils from leaves of Ocimum selloi B. submitted to organic and mineral fertilization, obtained by hydrodistillation and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) were compared. Essential oil was extracted in a Clevenger-type apparatus for 2 h 30 min and analyzed by GC-MS (Shimadzu, QP 5050 -DB- 5 capillary column - 30 m × 0. 25 mm × 0. 25 mm). Carrier gas was helium (1. 7 ml/min); split ratio: 1 : 30. Temperature program: 50 °C, rising to 180 °C at 5 °C/min, 180 °C, rising to 280 °C at 10 °C/min. Injector temperature: 240 °C and detector temperature: 230 °C. Identifications of chemical compounds {{were made by}} matching their mass spectra and Kovat?s indices (IK) values with known compounds reported in the literature. An Applied Separations-apparatus (Speed SFE, model 7071, Allentown, PA, EUA) was used for SFE extractions. They were conducted at pressure 200 bar and temperature 30 °C (20 min in static mode and 40 min in dynamic mode). The supercritical CO 2 flow rate was (6. 8 ± 0. 7) × 10 - 5 kg-CO 2 /s. The essential <b>oil</b> collected was <b>immersed</b> in ethylene glycol bath (5 °C). The yield of essential oils obtained by SFE was larger than hydrodistillation in both fertilization treatments (279 and 333 % for organic and mineral fertilizations, respectively). There were no differences between the fertilization treatments. The amount of the volatile components showed by GC-MS chromatogram was highest in the essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation than SFE. The main volatile constituents of the essential oils were trans-anethole (Hydrodistillation: organic - 52. 4 %; mineral - 55. 0 %/ SFE: Hydrodistillation - 62. 8 %; mineral - 66. 8 %) and methyl-chavicol (Hydrodistillation: organic - 37. 3 %; mineral - 38. 3 %/ SFE: organic - 8. 4 %; mineral - 4. 3 %). A reduction of methyl-chavicol relative proportion of essential oil obtained by SFE was observed. Cys-anethole, a-copaene, trans-cariofilene, germacrene-D, B-selinene, biciclogermacrene and spathulenol were expressed only in hydrodistillation. The extraction of essential oil by SFE presented larger yield of essential oil than hydrodistillation technique, presenting, however, these essential oils, different phytochemical profiles. 201...|$|R
