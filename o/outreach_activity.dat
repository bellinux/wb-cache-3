40|$|This {{document}} {{proposes a}} conceptual framework for a five-stage process for conducting IFPRI's research and <b>outreach</b> <b>activities.</b> This framework is {{based in part on}} IFPRI's own research experiences, both good and bad, in the field over the past several years. Its main objective is to codify these experiences to provide a template for future research and <b>outreach</b> <b>activities.</b> Such a framework could provide a common point of reference for most Institute-wide research and outreach, and greatly enhance consistency, efficiency, and efficacy, in implementation of research and <b>outreach</b> <b>activities</b> across all divisions. The nature of IFPRI's work requires innovative and different methods of conducting research and outreach. There is a richness and diversity in IFPRI's current modus operandi which should not be lost by adhering to only one model or framework. The proposed framework is not intended to replace this richness and diversity, but it simply demonstrates how in a number of instances, elements of such a framework have served the Institute well in the past, as an integrated scheme for conducting research and <b>outreach</b> <b>activities</b> and is worthy of further consideration.
