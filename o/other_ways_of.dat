5|$|In {{supplying}} this demand, the ice trade increasingly shifted north, {{away from}} Massachusetts and towards Maine. Various factors contributed to this. New Englands' winters became warmer during the 19th century, while industrialisation {{resulted in more}} of the natural ponds and rivers becoming contaminated. Less trade was brought through New England as <b>other</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> reaching western US markets were opened up, making it less profitable to trade ice from Boston, while the cost of producing ships in the region increased due to deforestation. Finally, in 1860 there {{was the first of}} four ice famines along the Hudson-warm winters that prevented the formation of ice in New England-creating shortages and driving up prices.|$|E
5|$|The 2-satisfiability {{problem is}} to find a truth {{assignment}} to these variables that makes the whole formula true. Such an assignment chooses whether to make each of the variables true or false, so that at least one literal to true in every clause becomes true. For the expression shown above, one possible satisfying assignment is the one that sets all seven of the variables to true. Every clause has at least one non-negated variable, so this assignment satisfies every clause. There are also 15 <b>other</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> setting all the variables so that the formula becomes true. Therefore, the 2-satisfiability instance represented by this expression is satisfiable.|$|E

25|$|Philosophy is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} life of reason, with normal human reason pursued in a more consistent and dedicated way than usual. Two categories of problem concerning reason have long been discussed by philosophers concerning reason, essentially being reasonings about reasoning itself as a human aim, or philosophizing about philosophizing. The first question is concerning whether we can be confident that reason can achieve knowledge of truth better than <b>other</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> trying to achieve such knowledge. The other question is whether a life of reason, a life that aims to be guided by reason, {{can be expected to}} achieve a happy life more so than <b>other</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> life (whether such a life of reason results in knowledge or not).|$|E

25|$|<b>Other</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> {{measuring}} {{water scarcity}} include examining the physical existence {{of water in}} nature, comparing nations with lower or higher volumes of water available for use.

25|$|Soft consonants are {{normally}} represented by an acute or a haček, but <b>other</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> writing are possible as well: nj, n’, etc. To avoid texts from becoming heavy on diacritics, {{it is recommended}} that before a vowel, soft consonants are written as a hard consonant followed by a j: nom. koń, gen. konja (instead of końa).|$|E
25|$|Under these {{simplifying}} assumptions, {{every member}} of the truss is then subjected to pure compression or pure tension forces – shear, bending moment, and other more-complex stresses are all practically zero. Trusses are physically stronger than <b>other</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> arranging structural elements, because nearly every material can resist a much larger load in tension or compression than in shear, bending, torsion, or other kinds of force.|$|E

25|$|In {{some of the}} low church traditions, other {{practices}} are sometimes added or substituted, as <b>other</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> symbolizing the confession and penitence of the day. For example, in one common variation, small cards are distributed to the congregation on which people are invited to write a sin they wish to confess. These small cards are brought forth to the altar table where they are burned.|$|E
25|$|The first fully {{terrestrial}} vertebrates were amniotes — {{their eggs}} had internal membranes {{that allowed the}} developing embryo to breathe but kept water in. This allowed amniotes to lay eggs on dry land, while amphibians generally need to lay their eggs in water (a few amphibians, such as the Surinam toad, have evolved <b>other</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> getting around this limitation). The first amniotes apparently arose in the middle Carboniferous from the ancestral reptiliomorphs.|$|E
25|$|The strings {{are usually}} tuned to A-D-E-A, {{although}} there are various <b>other</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> tuning. Since the revolutions in Chinese instrument-making during the 20th century, the softer twisted silk strings of earlier times have been exchanged for nylon-wound steel strings, which are far too strong for human fingernails, so false nails are now used, constructed of plastic or tortoise-shell, and affixed to the fingertips with the player's choice of elastic tape.|$|E
