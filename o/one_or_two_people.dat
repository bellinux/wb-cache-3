5|$|Traditionally, Hyderabadi haleem {{is cooked}} {{on a low}} flame of {{firewood}} for up to 12 hours in a bhatti (a cauldron covered with a brick and mud kiln). <b>One</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> are required to stir it continuously with wooden paddles throughout its preparation. For home-made Hyderabadi haleem, a Ghotni (a wooden hand masher) is used to stir it until it reaches a sticky-smooth consistency, similar to minced meat.|$|E

25|$|In 1919 {{the already}} busy Collins {{received}} yet another responsibility when de Valera appointed {{him to the}} Aireacht (ministry) as Minister for Finance. Most of the ministries existed only on paper or as <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> working in a room of a private house, given the circumstances of a brutal war in which ministers were liable to be arrested or killed by the Royal Irish Constabulary, British Army, Black and Tans or the Auxiliaries at a moment's notice.|$|E

25|$|When {{the time}} for balloting arrives, the electors choose <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> to act as tellers. Some states provide for the placing in {{nomination}} of a candidate to receive the electoral votes (the candidate {{for president of the}} political party of the electors). Each elector submits a written ballot with the name of a candidate for president. In New Jersey, the electors cast ballots by checking the name of the candidate on a pre-printed card; in North Carolina, the electors write the name of the candidate on a blank card. The tellers count the ballots and announce the result. The next step is the casting of the vote for vice president, which follows a similar pattern.|$|E
25|$|However, {{what both}} Takeda {{and his son}} Tokimune says should be taken with a big pinch of salt. Famous proponents of the art {{including}} Kondo sensei and Sagawa sensei have {{been quoted as saying}} Takeda and his son had the same teaching system ie only to teach <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> the real 'techniques' ie the aiki of the art. The rest are only taught the 'basics' or the external form of the art. As it stands, only a few were ever taught the real stuff and what the true masters of the art said or did was done to mislead a particular group of people into thinking that they were learning true aikijitsu. The same can be said for teachers of the modified form of daitoryu, the art of aikido.|$|E
25|$|In January 1958, the Aleppo Codex was smuggled out of Syria {{and sent}} to Jerusalem {{to be placed in}} the care of the chief rabbi of the Aleppo Jews. But by the {{influence}} of then President of Israel, Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, it was secretly taken by the government. In the late 1980s, the codex was placed in the Shrine of the Book at the Israel Museum. This finally gave scholars the chance to examine it and consider the claims that it is indeed the manuscript referred to by Maimonides. The work of Moshe Goshen-Gottstein on the few surviving pages of the Torah seems to have confirmed these claims beyond reasonable doubt. Goshen-Gottstein suggested (in the introduction to his facsimile reprint of the codex) that not only was it the oldest known masoretic Bible in a single volume, {{it was the first time}} ever that a complete Tanakh had been produced by <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> as a unified entity in a consistent style.|$|E

500|$|The bunkers were {{constructed}} of concrete, steel and iron and ranged {{in size from}} one- or two-person pillboxes with gun slits to large underground nuclear bomb shelters intended {{for use by the}} Party leadership and bureaucrats. The most common type of bunker is a small concrete dome set into the ground with a circular bottom extending downwards, just large enough for <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> to stand inside. Known as Qender Zjarri ("firing position") or QZ bunkers, they were prefabricated and transported to their final positions, where they were assembled. They consist of three main elements: a [...] diameter hemispherical concrete dome with a firing slit, a hollow cylinder to support the dome and an outer wall with a radius [...] larger than the cylinder. The gap between the cylinder and outer wall is filled with earth.|$|E
500|$|A related problem {{arising from}} the tablets' browser access was {{that even though the}} tablets were {{intended}} for people to use it {{for a short period of}} time, the Links began being [...] "monopolized" [...] almost as soon as they were unveiled. Some people would use the Links for hours at a time. Particularly, homeless New Yorkers would sometimes loiter around the Links, using newspaper dispensers and milk crates as [...] "makeshift furniture" [...] on which they could sit while using the Links. The New York Post characterized the Links as having become [...] "living rooms for vagrants." [...] As a result, LinkNYC staff were working on a way to help ensure that Links would not be monopolized by <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>people.</b> Proposals for solutions included putting time limits on how long the tablets could be used by any one person.|$|E

They can have up to 192 gears, giving them remarkable hill-climbing capabilities. They are used for long distance travel {{as well as local}} use; some are used for cycle-commuting to work.|$|R
2500|$|Historically the {{simplicity}} of game environments reduced the required number of sounds needed, and thus only <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> were directly responsible for the sound recording and design. [...] As the video game business has grown and computer sound reproduction quality has increased, however, the team of sound designers dedicated to game projects has likewise grown and the demands placed on them may now approach those of mid-budget motion pictures.|$|E

5000|$|There is {{the problem}} of {{determining}} just how many are needed to have a majority or consensus. Is merely greater than 50% significant enough and why? Should the percentage be larger, such as 80 or 90 percent, and how does that make a real difference?

5000|$|The {{city now}} known as Chiayi {{originally}} took {{its name from the}} aboriginal tribe who lived there: the Tirosen. The former Chinese placename was Tsu-lo-san (...) , a representation of the original Formosan-language name.

In some English-language texts the spellings Chu-lo or Choolo are used.|$|R
2500|$|Bombardier {{wanted to}} develop a fast, {{lightweight}} snowmobile that could carry <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>people.</b> In the early 1950s, Armand set aside his dream to focus on developing his company's other tracked vehicles, {{but by the end}} of the decade, smaller, more efficient engines had been developed and were starting to come onto the market. Bombardier resumed his efforts to build a [...] "miniature" [...] snowmobile. He worked alongside his eldest son Germain, who shared his father's mechanical talents. Armand and Germain developed several prototypes of the lightweight snowmobile and finally, the first Bombardier snowmobile went on sale in 1959.|$|E

2500|$|Russia {{was quick}} to respond through Parliamentary {{channels}} as there {{could no longer be}} discussion through diplomats, and on 24 March, Alexander Romanovich, deputy chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the Duma, stated that “We will never give up Crimea. Crimea is Russia.” [...] Romanovich, who saw the influence of the Ukrainian-Canadian community, said Canadian actions in response to the Crimea crisis were unnecessarily provocative, and that Russia would match each round of sanctions with new measures of its own, as they had just sanctioned 13 Canadian Parliamentarians, government officials {{and the head of the}} Ukrainian-Canadian Congress the previous day. [...] “Our relations with Canada are not just unconstructive, they’re poor. Canada stopped military relations with Russia, and so <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> who were over there teaching got sent home. It’s ridiculous. [...] These sanctions are a way of waging war without weapons. To use sanctions is to be belligerent.” ...|$|E
