The need for total replacement has been brought about by 2015's new European regulations regarding crash safety for pedestrians that render the Defender's design obsolete (see more at Euro NCAP).|$|E

Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) secretly recorded phone conversations between Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his mother (they vaguely and indirectly discussed jihad) and sent these to the FBI as evidence of possible extremist links within the family. However, while Russia <b>offered</b> <b>US</b> intelligence services warnings that Tsarnaev planned to link up with extremist groups abroad, an FBI investigation yielded {{no evidence to support}} those claims at the time. In addition, subsequent U.S. requests for additional information about Tsarnaev went unanswered by the Russians.|$|E

[...] Jennifer Schaffer from the Stanford Daily complimented the sensitivity of the song and commented that [...] "Shakira offers her listeners a far more vulnerable persona" [...] through it.

500|$|Davis {{verbally}} {{committed to}} Kentucky on August 13, 2010, choosing {{it over his}} other finalists, which were DePaul, Ohio State, and Syracuse. He had officially visited DePaul and Ohio State. On August 24, 2010, he became the number one rated player in the national class of 2011 at Scout.com. [...] The pay-for-play scandal had played out very publicly in the press. Before Davis committed to Kentucky, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that his father, Anthony Davis, Sr. asked Kentucky for $200,000 for a commitment from his son. The report was initially released on Wednesday August 4, 2010 by Sun-Times reporter Michael O'Brien. Citing [...] "a reliable source", he posted the following text [...] "rumors/sources that have Davis choosing Kentucky are also alleging that the commitment cost $200,000." [...] before it was edited to say [...] "rumors that Davis' commitment is for sale have surfaced since he cut his list of schools down about a month ago." [...] and then removed later that day from the Sun-Times high school sports website following a threat from a University of Kentucky lawyer. A Lexington, Kentucky law firm sent a letter under the signature of attorney Stephen L.

[...] Baker's letter also threatened potential [...] "punitive damages for your malicious and willful actions." [...] Anthony Davis Sr. declined to speak to the Chicago Tribune on August 4 regarding the allegation, although he denied the allegations to the Sun-Times stating [...] "We haven't asked anyone for anything, and no one has <b>offered</b> <b>us</b> anything", on July 30 before the story broke.|$|E

[...] Denise Boyd of the BBC wrote: [...] "The introduction [...] 'Senorita' immediately grabs your attention." [...] Tyler Martin of Stylus said that the song's rhythm section was [...] "brilliant, a simple, yet distinctive beat that could only come from the Neptunes. The song allows for much amusement in {{the last minute and}} a half with a sing-along that is more wonderful and surprising than most artists have <b>offered</b> <b>us</b> this year." [...] Jonathan Takiff of the Philadelphia Daily News wrote that the track and [...] "Nothing Else", another song from the album, reshape [...] "Stevie Wonder-style Latin pop". Katie McDonald of Boston College wrote: [...] "The album opens with the Latin and hip-hop influenced 'Senorita'. Although this reviewer was a little amused by Timberlake's use of the word 'Momma' in reference to a girl, this track is nothing to mock. Timberlake's voice complements the dynamic beat; and although the lyrics are in no way profound, at least he wrote them himself." [...] Lisa Verrico of The Times wrote that the song could be 'NSYNC [...] "with a salsa flavour". Christian Dahlager of Iowa State Daily noted that Timberlake [...] "cops classic Michael Jackson" [...] throughout the album, and on the tracks [...] "Señorita" [...] and [...] "Rock Your Body". Howard Cohen of Knight Ridder said that in the album Timberlake [...] "appropriates Jackson's trademark 'Thriller'-era falsetto squeals and staccato vocal style on the tuneless first single 'Like I Love You', 'Senorita' and a couple other cuts." ...|$|E

2500|$|David Bowie, {{a fan of}} the band, then {{offered them}} a song he had just written.

And then {{he sat down on the}} floor, Regent Street it was, in a publisher's office, and plays 'All The Young Dudes' on an acoustic guitar." [...] It reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart, and revived the band, who were appreciative of Bowie's rescue. Guitarist Ralphs relates that Bowie taught Mott studio tricks, but one of the best-known sounds during the period was a 'hand-clap-in-the-toilet' routine that relied more on Hunter's vision than it did on Bowie's clearly more experienced studio abilities. Bowie guitarist Mick Ronson also significantly contributed to Mott's sound, a fact noticed by Hunter, who would later collaborate with Ronson a great deal.|$|E

Thomas Dugdale also claimed Baldwin said to him: [...] "If we do have a war, Winston must be Prime Minister. If he is in [...] now we shan't be able to engage in that war as a united nation". The General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Walter Citrine, recalled a conversation he had had with Baldwin on 5 April 1943: [...] "Baldwin thought his [...] political recovery was marvellous.

After Capitol declined, a five-year agreement was reached with Vee-Jay Records, an independent (mostly rhythm and blues) label based in Chicago, {{as part of a}} deal for the rights to another EMI artist, Frank Ifield. The first Beatles single released by Vee-Jay was [...] "Please Please Me" [...] in February 1963. Art Roberts, music director of popular Chicago radio station WLS, placed [...] "Please Please Me" [...] into radio rotation in late February, arguably the first time a Beatles record was heard on American radio. Radio personality Dick Biondi was the first to play the record on his show. [...] "Please Please Me" [...] reached number 35 on WLS's weekly survey but failed to chart nationally. Vee-Jay released [...] "From Me to You" [...] in May 1963 which reached number 33 at radio station KRLA in Los Angeles, where Biondi was now working. The single [...] "bubbled under" [...] the Billboard Hot 100 chart at number 116, however, in August Vee-Jay's rights to the Beatles were cancelled by EMI for non-payment of royalties.|$|E

[...] Sonny Barger, who also called into the KSAN forum, states: [...] "We were told by one of the (other Hells Angels) clubs if we showed up down there (and) sat on the stage and drink some beer ... that the Stones manager or somebody had bought for us." [...] In his lengthy call, Barger mentions the beer deal yet again: [...] "I ain't no cop, I ain't never going to ever pretend to be no cop. I didn't go there to police nothing, man. They told me if I could sit on the edge of the stage so nobody could climb over me, I could drink beer until the show was over. And that's what I went there to do." ...|$|E

He would become close friends with Noam Chomsky, Edward Said, Israel Shahak, Andrew Kopkind, and Saul Landau, among others. Cockburn wrote for many publications, {{including}} The New York Review of Books, Esquire, and Harper's. From 1973 to 1983 he was a writer with The Village Voice, originating its longstanding [...] "Press Clips" [...] column, in his time there he interviewed Rupert Murdoch after a struggle over the ownership of The Voice culminated in Murdoch buying the paper. James Ridgeway later noted [...] "Murdoch, when he owned the Voice, was said to gag on some of Alex's pointed epithets, but he never did anything about it. He actually had us both to lunch and <b>offered</b> <b>us</b> a column." [...] Cockburn went on to write Idle Passion: Chess and the Dance of Death (1975) as a class history of chess, {{and a lot of}} [...] "bogus Freudian stuff", as he would later put it, in a critical evaluation of the claims made for chess. In the late 1970s Cockburn and Ridgeway wrote Political Ecology in which they went through numerous areas of US domestic policy, whether it was housing or agriculture, critically examining each topic, making proposals to adjust policy.|$|E
