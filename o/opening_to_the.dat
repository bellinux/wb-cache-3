5|$|In early 1995, {{planning}} began for Montu, fourteen {{months prior}} to the ride <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public. The owners of Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, Busch Entertainment (since renamed SeaWorld Entertainment), entered into an agreement with Bolliger and Mabillard which would see them add Montu to Busch Gardens Tampa Bay in 1996, followed in 1997 by the additions of Alpengeist at Busch Gardens Williamsburg and The Great White at SeaWorld San Antonio. On May 16, 1996, Montu officially opened to the public. At the time of its <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public, the ride was the tallest and fastest inverted roller coaster in the world.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the ventral {{scales of}} the snake is an anal plate that protects the <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cloaca (a shared opening for waste and {{reproductive}} material to pass) on the underside near the tail. This anal scale may be single or divided into a pair. The part of the body beyond the anal scale is considered to be the tail.|$|E
25|$|Under <b>the</b> {{body are}} <b>openings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mantle cavity, which {{contains}} the gills (ctenidia) and <b>openings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> excretory and reproductive systems. At {{the front of}} the mantle cavity lies the siphon, which the squid uses for locomotion via precise jet propulsion. In this form of locomotion, water is sucked into the mantle cavity and expelled out of the siphon in a fast, strong jet. The direction of the siphon can be changed, <b>to</b> suit <b>the</b> direction of travel.|$|R
40|$|Burst {{kinetics}} {{of single}} Ca-activated K channels in excised patches of surface membrane from cultured rat muscle were studied using the patch-clamp technique. Channel activity was separated into bursts using a calculated gap {{derived from the}} distribution of shut intervals. Shut intervals greater than the calculated gap were taken as gaps between bursts. The distribution of burst duration was described as the sum of two exponentials with mean durations of about 0. 8 and 24 msec (1 microM-Cai, + 20 mV), suggesting two classes of bursts (short and long). The composition of short and long bursts was determined from comparisons of the distributions of open intervals, unit bursts (bursts of single openings), and openings/burst. Short bursts consisted mainly of single <b>openings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> open channel state of short mean lifetime. Long bursts consisted {{of one or more}} <b>openings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> (compound) open-channel state of long mean lifetime, plus, in fewer than 70 % of the long bursts, one or more <b>openings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> short open-channel state. The frequency of occurrence of bursts from each class first increased and then decreased with increasing [Ca]i, with the number of long bursts increasing at a greater rate than the number of short bursts. The number of openings/short burst was relatively independent of [Ca]i, while the number of openings/long burst increased, often more than linearly, with increasing [Ca]i. This increase arose almost entirely from an increase in <b>openings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> long open state. These results suggest that <b>openings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> long open state typically require the binding of three or more Ca ions, and <b>openings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> short open state typically require the binding of at least one Ca ion. This is the case whether the openings occur in isolation as bursts of single openings or in bursts composed of both types of openings. An obvious burst of channel activity would occur when the channel opens and closes several times without losing all its bound Ca. The power relationship between [Ca]i and the percentage of time spent in the open state is accounted for in terms of the effects of [Ca]i upon mean channel open time, openings/burst, and burst rate. A model is presented that describes quantitatively many features of the burst kinetics of the Ca-activated K channel for constant [Ca]i...|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the events}} of the summer, Alonso made a {{confident}} start to the season and both his peers and the press praised his strength of character, citing his influence as a factor in the team's strong <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> season. Alonso's importance to the team was further underlined when he scored the only goal, through a deflection, in a 0–1 victory against Chelsea, making Liverpool the first away team to win at Stamford Bridge in over four years. Statistical analysis reflected Alonso's good form: on 11 December, figures from Opta Sports revealed that he was the first Premier League player to complete 1,000 successful passes in the season. His last goal for Liverpool came in their 1–3 away win at Hull City on 25 April, striking after his free kick deflected off the Hull wall.|$|E

5|$|In November 2004, Congress {{appropriated}} $700,000 for the NWR {{to cover}} the costs of designing a public visitor’s center. By 2005 construction had progressed on public facilities at the site that included trails, observations decks, parking, and an entrance from Oregon Route 99W with plans for permanently <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public in 2006. In July 2005, the refuge received $3.9 million from the federal government to complete a visitor’s center and new headquarters for the facility. In February 2006, construction began on the main observation deck at the visitor’s plaza, with plans to open the refuge to the public in June.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the rocks}} and {{minerals}} are housed in glass cases along the walls in the basement. Before <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public an elevator {{was added to the}} home. The museum includes a lapidary and arts gallery, agate gallery, petrified wood gallery, oddities gallery, crystal gallery, Northwest gallery, and fossil gallery. There is also an educational room and gift shop, while the outside grounds include a walk that features sandstone, columns of basalt, and a pile of rocks for children to climb over to find stones. This walk includes a 1,200 pound (540kg) rock made of pumice.|$|E
5|$|Production of the {{new version}} of the opening episode took place in what was to have been a three-week break for the cast between {{production}} blocks. Gina McKee was initially very concerned about having her character's early life story changed when she had already based elements of her later performance on the previously-established version. Eccleston was also unhappy about the sudden changes. However, McKee felt that the new version of episode one eventually made for a much stronger <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> story.|$|E

5|$|Sea anemones {{have what}} can be {{described}} as an incomplete gut; the gastrovascular cavity functions as a stomach and possesses a single <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outside, which operates as both a mouth and anus. Waste and undigested matter is excreted through this opening. The mouth is typically slit-like in shape, and bears a groove at one or both ends. The groove, termed a siphonophore, is ciliated, and helps to move food particles inwards and circulate water through the gastrovascular cavity.|$|E
5|$|Somerset had {{performed}} well but missed out narrowly {{in both the}} other one-day competitions in 2009, and could have clinched the competition with victory in their final match. News filtered through to the County Ground during their final match, against Durham, that leaders Sussex had lost to Worcestershire, meaning that a win against the north-eastern team would guarantee Somerset the title. The result rarely looked likely; a rapid <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chase by Durham openers Phil Mustard and Ian Blackwell provided a platform for their team to claim victory, and deny Somerset the title. Three of Somerset's bowlers claimed ten or more wickets in the competition (Ben Phillips, 14; Alfonso Thomas, 13; Charl Willoughby, 11), {{more than any other}} county in Division One.|$|E

However, the financial difficulties were too great and in January 1984 he transferred ownership of the house, garden and some of the contents to the National Trust, a charitable body experienced in the management of historic properties. The National Trust further purchased at a cost of £8 million (worth about £ today) 1,317acres (5.3km²) of parkland and much of the remaining contents with a grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund.|$|E
5|$|Construction on Intimidator began {{during the}} summer of 2009 with land {{clearing}} and footings being constructed. Track pieces first began to arrive at Carowinds on August 7, 2009. About 3 weeks later, Intimidator was officially announced on August 26, 2009 by Carowinds. Along with the announcement, Carowinds reached a licensing agreement with Dale Earnhardt, Inc. to utilize the Dale Earnhardt brand as part of the ride. One of Earnhardt's sons, Kerry Earnhardt, was on-hand for the press conference announcing the attraction and endorsed the ride on behalf of the family. The first supports and track for Intimidator were installed on September 1, 2009. The lift hill was erected on October 1, 2009 and was completed on October 13, 2009. In order to install the last lift piece, 3 cranes were required. Construction on the roller coaster layout continued through November and December with the final track piece installed on December 21, 2009. Construction on the station, mechanics, and landscaping of Intimidator took place during the months of January and February. On February 4, 2010, testing of Intimidator commenced with the new roller coaster officially <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public on March 27, 2010.|$|E
5|$|From the 1930s {{until the}} 1950s, the John Herron Art Institute placed an {{emphasis}} on professionalism and growth in collections. Wilbur Peat, director of the museum from 1929 until 1965, acquired significant portions of the collection. Peat also made connections with benefactors such as Dr. George H. A. Clowes, Booth Tarkington, and Eli Lilly. Caroline Marmon Fesler, president of the Art Association of Indianapolis, gave a number of artworks in the 1940s, including 20th-century modern artworks and Post-Impressionist works by Cézanne, Van Gogh, and Seurat. After years of debate surrounding expansion and relocation of the museum and school, the great grandchildren of Eli Lilly, J.K. Lilly III and Ruth Lilly, donated the family estate, Oldfields, to the Art Association of Indianapolis in 1966. One year later {{it was decided that}} the school would become a part of Indiana University's Indianapolis campus in an effort to assist with accreditation. That same year it was confirmed that the museum would relocate to Oldfields, with the new Krannert Pavilion <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public in October 1970. In 1969, prior to moving to the new site, the Art Association of Indianapolis officially changed its name to the Indianapolis Museum of Art.|$|E

5|$|Rumors that PortAventura {{would be}} {{investing}} in a new Bolliger & Mabillard Flying Coaster or Dive Coaster roller coaster emerged in late 2010. In May 2011, speculation that the park was planning to build a hypercoaster that would pass over Dragon Khan arose. Land clearing also began {{in the summer of}} 2011. Shambhala was announced to the public on October 24, 2011; the layout of the roller coaster was leaked 2 days earlier. The last piece of track was installed in mid-April 2012 following a signing event and the placement of the several country flags on the track. Testing of the ride began in the same month. Following the completion of testing, a ribbon cutting ceremony was held on May 12, 2012 before <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public the same day. Over 300 workers from countries such as Germany, France, Hungary, Poland, Switzerland, and United States of America took part in the construction of Shambhala.|$|E
5|$|They did, however, {{have certain}} traits {{separating}} them from cartilaginous fishes, traits {{that would become}} pivotal {{in the evolution of}} terrestrial forms. With the exception of a pair of spiracles, the gills did not open singly to the exterior as they do in sharks; rather, they were encased in a gill chamber stiffened by membrane bones and covered by a bony operculum, with a single <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> exterior. The cleithrum bone, forming the posterior margin of the gill chamber, also functioned as anchoring for the pectoral fins. The cartilaginous fishes do not have such an anchoring for the pectoral fins. This allowed for a movable joint {{at the base of the}} fins in the early bony fishes, and would later function in a weight bearing structure in tetrapods. As part of the overall armour of rhomboid cosmin scales, the skull had a full cover of dermal bone, constituting a skull roof over the otherwise shark-like cartilaginous inner cranium. Importantly, they also had a swim bladder/lung, a feature lacking in sharks and rays.|$|E

Meanwhile, back at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, no one is aware of what has {{happened}} to the other doctors. Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) prepares the annual dinner for the departing residents, which Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams), and Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) are dreading. Avery makes the choice to take a job offer at Tulane Medical Center, and he and Kepner share a moment. Dr. Ben Warren (Jason George) and Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) decide to get married, even though Warren is going to start his surgical internship in Los Angeles. After realizing Dr. Teddy Altman (Kim Raver) was offered a chief position at United States Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) and is refusing to leave Seattle out of loyalty, Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), the chief of surgery, fires her to free her from the hospital where her husband died. As the episode ends, Hunt picks up his messages to discover the surgical team never made it to Boise. The residents, finally excited to celebrate at Webber's dinner, are left waiting for their stranded friends. The remaining crash survivors are left struggling to stay awake as their last match goes out.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of {{introducing}} internal courtyard on thermal comfort performance of a case study terrace house in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia. The inclusion of an internal courtyard in building design is attributed <b>to</b> maximize <b>the</b> thermal interactions between the building and outdoor environment.

Based on computer simulations, the introduction of internal courtyard into a typical Malaysian terrace house will increase heat gain in the indoor spaces which {{do not have any}} <b>openings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outdoor environment except into the courtyard. In contrast spaces with <b>openings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outdoors as well as courtyard will experience better thermal conditions.
