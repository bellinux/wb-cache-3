Players signed autographs and held on-field drills with the veterans, while soldiers and Marines spoke of their experiences. Chris Hoke, {{who attended the}} event said, [...] "These {{are the people who}} fight for us to have our freedom and be who we are as Americans.

During a visit to Melbourne in 1955 to inspect the preparations, Brundage was less than impressed with the progress achieved under Kent Hughes's chairmanship and condemned Kent Hughes's apparent lack of concern at the looming deadline for the Games. Not one to take criticism lightly, Kent Hughes {{was quoted as saying}} that he had enough to worry about without having [...] "Chicago blow-ins come <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> blow their tops over nothing in particular and annoy everyone in general." ...|$|E
500|$|In November2007, Usher {{hoped to}} release his fifth album, titled Here I Stand, but [...] "issues in his {{personal}} life" [...] delayed the album. According to reports, Usher has {{to spend more time}} with his then-pregnant wife. The expected November release date was booked to coincide with that of Usher's fragrance line. Released on May13,2008. The continually changing release dates became frustrating for Usher; Dupri said to Billboard, [...] "The last couple [...] times I've been around , you could tell he's got the bug to hurry up and put this record out. He wants to get back <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> give the people that. He's got that itch." [...] Here I Stand was first released by LaFace Records in Mexico and several European countries on May13,2008; releases in other countries followed.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} devised {{following}} a lecture given by writer Mike Bullen {{and executive producer}} Andy Harries at the Screen Producers Association of Australia conference in November 2000. Bullen and Harries already knew that actress Fay Ripley {{did not want to}} renew her contract to play Jenny Gifford for the whole fourth series, so developed a storyline where Jenny's ex-husband Pete would meet and fall in love with an Australian woman after his divorce. The storyline would culminate in an episode set in Australia, which Harries wanted [...] "for no desperately good reason except that it's a nice place to go". The storyline was plotted and Kimberley Joseph was cast as Jo Ellison, who makes her first appearance in Series 4, Episode 1. As originally planned, the fourth series would have depicted all of the main characters permanently emigrating to Australia; Bullen said, [...] "One of them , whose relationship is no more, meets an Australian in England and he comes <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> the notion is that the others follow. Then one of the others would have a reason for wanting to walk away from his life so he comes out here too. That's really an excuse to bring everyone out, and the final episode would be a 90-minute special looking back on their lives up to that point; because it would be the last episode with these characters." [...] Having the characters permanently based in Australia opened up the possibility of spin-off series set in the country. The direction of the fourth series, and thus the finale, changed significantly when Helen Baxendale announced that she was pregnant.|$|E

Don't let this get around." [...] He attracted other New York writers to Hollywood who contributed to a burst of creative, tough, and sardonic styles of writing for the fast-growing movie industry. What distinguished his screenplays were [...] "occasional flashes of the Mankiewicz humor and satire {{that proved to be}} a foreshadowing of a new type of slick, satirical, typically American film that depended almost totally on dialogue for its success." ...|$|E
2500|$|Moss was {{not happy}} in Oakland, and on November 14, 2006, when he was honored as a kick {{returner}} by having an award named after him, he responded to questions about his dropped passes and lackluster effort in several games. Moss said, [...] "Maybe because I'm unhappy and I'm not too much excited about what's going on, so, my concentration and focus level tend to go down sometimes when I'm in a bad mood". Days later, he reiterated his unhappiness with losing games and {{being a member of}} the Raiders on his weekly segment with Fox Sports Radio, saying, [...] "I might want to look forward to moving somewhere else next year to have another start and really feel good about going <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> playing football".|$|E

2500|$|During {{a game in}} 1982, Frank Layden, {{then head}} coach of the Utah Jazz, had seen enough of his team's poor {{performance}} and wanted an early exit. Layden verbally abused Strom so he could get ejected from the game. Strom knew {{what he was trying to}} do, and when Layden asked why he didn't eject him, Strom replied, [...] "I know what you're trying to do, Frank, but if I've got to stay <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> watch this shit, so do you". After Game 4 of the 1987 NBA Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics, Red Auerbach confronted Strom in the hallway near the locker rooms and told Strom, [...] "That was the worst officiated game I ever saw!", referring to the fact that the Lakers shot 14 free throws in the fourth quarter to the Celtics' 1. Strom stared back at Auerbach and said, [...] "Arnold, you're showing all the class I knew you always had." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1969 Bukowski {{accepted}} {{an offer from}} Black Sparrow Press publisher John Martin and quit his post office job to dedicate himself to full-time writing. He was then 49 years old. As he explained in a letter at the time, [...] "I have one of two choices – stay in {{the post office and}} go crazy ... or stay <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> play at writer and starve. I have decided to starve." [...] Less than one month after leaving the postal service he finished his first novel, Post Office. As a measure of respect for Martin's financial support and faith in a relatively unknown writer, Bukowski published almost all of his subsequent major works with Black Sparrow Press, which became a highly successful enterprise owing to Martin's business acumen and editorial skills. [...] An avid supporter of small independent presses, Bukowski continued to submit poems and short stories to innumerable small publications throughout his career.|$|E
2500|$|The cage {{giving way}} {{completely}} {{was a surprise}} to both Foley and The Undertaker. The Undertaker later said that he thought Foley was dead following the second fall. [...] Foley was genuinely knocked unconscious for a few moments from the impact, but was able to come around. Terry Funk wrote in his autobiography, [...] "Watching from the back, I thought he was dead. I ran <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> looked down at him, still lying in the ring where he'd landed. His eyes weren't rolled back in his head, but they looked totally glazed over, like a dead fish's eyes." [...] Foley later said that the only reason he survived the fall was because he did not take the chokeslam properly. In his memoir Have a Nice Day, Foley called it both the best and worst chokeslam he ever took, saying that despite its looks, he would have likely died if he had landed properly. He also cited the fact that the ring he landed in had a harder surface than the modern rings do, which stopped his momentum once he landed. Foley would later explain that the roof of the cell was supposed to sag sufficiently so that Undertaker could kick him through, allowing him to dangle by his feet and eventually fall in a rotation to land on his front.|$|E
