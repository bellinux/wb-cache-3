40|$|ABSTRACT: The chemo- and regioselectivity and {{functional}} group compatibility {{in gold and}} palladium cooperatively catalyzed cross-coupling reactions were determined in the synthesis of lactones; the selectivity in the gold and palladium dual-metal catalysis system was distinct from that available for the same class of substrates in systems with <b>only</b> gold <b>catalysis</b> or <b>only</b> palladium <b>catalysis</b> rather than dual catalysis. The dual-catalytic rearrangement reaction selectively promoted oxidative addition at the C−O bond over the C−Br bond, providing a useful C−Br bond handle for downstream functionalization showcased via Suzuki−Miyaura and Sonogashira coupling reactions. Product classes were expanded from isocoumarins to three previously unpublished ring classes: pyrone, indolepyrone, and furopyrone. When two metals cooperate in catalysis, it creates th...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOxidation {{capacities}} of laccase, manganese peroxidase (MnP) and lignin peroxidase (LiP) from Phlebia radiata were compared using non-phenolic (veratryl alcohol and ABTS) and phenolic (syringaldazine, vanillalacetone and Phenol red) compounds as reducing substrates. The effect of Mn(II) on enzyme reactions was also studied. Highest specific activities were recorded with laccase in the oxidation of phenolic compounds or ABTS and irrespective of MN(II) concentration.

To extend the properties of this class of materials, we have developed a means of synthesizing Pt and Pt-based alloy nanoclusters in the capsid of a virus. Pure Pt and Pt-alloy nanoclusters are formed through the chemical reduction of [PtCl 4]− by NaBH 4 with/without additional metal ions (Co or Fe). The opening and closing of the ion channels in the virus capsid were controlled by changing the pH and ionic strength of the solution. The size of the nanoclusters is limited to 18 nm by the internal diameter of the capsid. Their magnetic properties suggest potential applications in hyperthermia for the Co–Pt and Fe–Pt magnetic alloy nanoclusters.

Similar particle size distributions were obtained for iron deposited on CNTs containing various amounts of SOFGs. We proposed that formation of hydrogen bonds between EG on the CNT surface and sodium hydroxide is likely responsible, which creates precipitating sites for iron ions on the CNT surface.

Localization of Arc 1 p, MetRS and GluRS in living cells using green fluorescent protein showed that these three proteins are cytoplasmic and largely excluded from the nucleus. However, when their assembly into a complex is inhibited, significant amounts of MetRS, GluRS and Arc 1 p can enter the nucleus.

40|$|Human CD 38 is a {{multifunctional}} ectoenzyme {{responsible for}} catalyzing the conversions from {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide}} (NAD) to cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and from cADPR to ADP-ribose (ADPR). Both cADPR and ADPR are calcium messengers that can mobilize intracellular stores and activate influx as well. In this study, we determined three crystal structures of the human CD 38 enzymatic domain complexed with cADPR at 1. 5 -Å resolution, with its analog, cyclic GDP-ribose (cGDPR) (1. 68 Å) and with NGD (2. 1 Å), a substrate analog of NAD.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the properties of cobalamin complexes with imidazolate using the density functional B 3 LYP method, In particular, we have compared imidazolate (Imm) with imidazole and 5, 6 -dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB), and studied how constraints in the axial Co-N bond length may affect {{the strength of the}} Co-C bond. The results show that the optimum Co-N-Imm bond is similar to 0. 2 Angstrom shorter than that of imidazole. There is no indication from crystal structures that the histidine ligand would be deprotonated in the enzymes. However, it is likely that it attains some imidazolate character through its hydrogen bond to a conserved aspartate residue. The Co-N bond with imidazolate is three times more rigid than that with imidazole or DMB, but twice as flexible as the Co-C bond. Constraints in the Co-N-Imm bond length give rise to a larger change in the corrin conformation than imidazole, but smaller than for DMB. The resulting effect for the Co-C bond dissociation energy is larger for imidazolate than for imidazole or DMB. However, even the largest reasonable distortion can <b>only</b> enhance <b>catalysis</b> by 15 kJ mol(- 1). Therefore, we conclude that, irrespective {{of the nature of the}} N-base, constraints in the axial Co-N bond lengths cannot be the main reason for the catalytic power of cobalamin enzymes...|$|R
40|$|Temperature-responsive ionic liquids (ILs), their fundanmental behaviors, and {{catalytic}} applications were introduced, {{especially the}} concepts of upper critical solution temperature (UCST) and lower critical solution temperature (LCST). It is described that, during a catalytic reaction, they form a homogeneous mixture with the reactants and products at reaction temperature but separate from them afterward at ambient conditions. It is shown that this behavior offers an effective alternative approach to overcome gas/liquid–solid interface mass transfer limitations in many catalytic transformations. It {{should be noted that}} IL-based thermomorphic systems are rarely elaborated until now, especially in the field of catalytic applications. The aim {{of this article is to}} provide a comprehensive review about thermomorphic mixtures of an IL with H 2 O and/or organic compounds. Special focus is laid on their temperature dependence concerning UCST and LCST behavior, including systems with conventional ILs, metal-containing ILs, polymerized ILs, as well as the thermomorphic behavior induced via host–guest complexation. A wide range of applications using thermoregulated IL systems in chemical catalytic reactions as well as enzymatic catalysis were also demonstrated in detail.

40|$|Many enzymes {{acting on}} DNA require Mg 2 + ions not <b>only</b> for <b>catalysis</b> {{but also to}} bind DNA. Binding studies often employ Ca 2 + as a {{substitute}} for Mg 2 +, to promote DNA binding whilst disallowing catalysis. The SfiI endonuclease requires divalent metal ions to bind DNA but, in contrast to many systems where Ca 2 + mimics Mg 2 +, Ca 2 + causes SfiI to bind DNA almost irreversibly. Equilibrium binding by wild-type SfiI cannot be conducted with Mg 2 + present as the DNA is cleaved so, to study the effect of Mg 2 + on DNA binding, two catalytically-inactive mutants were constructed. The mutants bound DNA in the presence of either Ca 2 + or Mg 2 + but, unlike wild-type SfiI with Ca 2 +, the binding was reversible. With both mutants, dissociation was slow with Ca 2 + but was in one case much faster with Mg 2 +. Hence, Ca 2 + can affect DNA binding differently from Mg 2 +. Moreover, SfiI is an archetypal system for DNA looping; on DNA with two recognition sites, it binds to both sites and loops out the intervening DNA. While the dynamics of looping cannot be measured with wild-type SfiI and Ca 2 +, it becomes accessible with the mutant and Mg 2 +...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of the {{chemical}} disequilibrium provided by the mixing of hydrothermal fluids and seawater in present-day systems indicates that organic synthesis from CO 2 or carbonic acid is thermodynamically favoured in {{the conditions in which}} hyperthermophilic microorganisms are known to live. These organisms lower the Gibbs free energy of {{the chemical}} mixture by synthesizing many of the components of their cells. Primary productivity is enormous in hydrothermal systems because it depends <b>only</b> on <b>catalysis</b> of thermodynamically favourable, exergonic reactions. It follows that hydrothermal systems may be the most favourable environments for life on Earth. This fact makes hydrothermal systems logical candidates for the location of the emergence of life, a speculation that is supported by genetic evidence that modern hyperthermophilic organisms are closer to a common ancestor than any other forms of life. The presence of hydrothermal systems on the early Earth would correspond to the presence of liquid water. Evidence that hydrothermal systems existed early in the history of Mars raises the possibility that life may have emerged on Mars as well. Redox reactions between water and rock establish the potential for organic synthesis in and around hydrothermal systems. Therefore, the single most important parameter for modelling the geochemical emergence of life on the early Earth or Mars is the composition of the rock which hosts the hydrothermal system...|$|R

Rate coefficients for all elementary steps in a reaction scheme consisting of both the base catalyzed and the nucleophile initiated mechanism are calculated using CBS-QB 3 corrected for solvation with COSMO-RS. Diffusional limitations are taken into account using the coupled encounter pair model. The ab initio apparent kinetic parameters are used in a microkinetic model and simulated conversions agree well with experimental data. Competition with the aza-Michael addition is shown to be insignificant. Regardless of the choice of ene or catalyst, conversion is governed by an anionic cycle in which first an addition from the thiolate to the ene occurs, followed by a rate-controlling proton transfer to the obtained Michael adduct anion from another thiol. For acrylates and vinylsulfones, the {{addition of}} the thiolate to the ene is quasi-equilibrated, while for maleimides this elementary reaction has a positive affinity, explaining their large reactivity. The choice of catalyst or ene strongly affects the initiation mechanism. Using tertiary phosphines only nucleophilic initiation takes place while with tertiary amines, <b>only</b> base <b>catalysis</b> occurs. For primary and secondary amines both initiation mechanisms contribute.

Further, a significant contribution of the 2 ′-OH to activity was indicated by the finding that AcLeu-dAMP was inactive as donor substrate, although {{it is a good}} inhibitor of peptide bond formation and thus, is presumably bound to the P-site. However, Di(AcLeu) - 2 ′-OCH 3 -Ade and DiAcLeu-AMP were moderately active in this assay suggesting that the reactivity of the 3 ′-acylaminoacid ester is stimulated by the presence of the 2 ′-oxygen group.

Furthermore, the chemoton model has two complementary (autocatalytic) reaction networks within such a self-generated boundary (“membrane system”): a metabolic network (“cyclic subsystem”) and an informational network (“genetic subsystem”) [4, 5]. In [17], a partitioned polymer model was studied in the context of RAF sets where reactions can only involve molecule types from one of two partitions (e.g., either only RNA or <b>only</b> peptides), but <b>catalysis</b> can be both within and across partitions. This study showed that the existence of RAF sets is equally likely (and for similar levels of catalysis) as in a standard non-partitioned polymer model. Thus, systems with an explicit distinction between a metabolic and a genetic network can also be dealt with in terms of RAF sets. Finally, to model a possibly semi-permeable boundary, additional “transport” reactions can be included in the CRS that indicate which molecule types can cross the boundary in one or both ways.|$|R

In this work, rice husk supported platinum (RHA-Pt) and titanium (RHA-Ti) catalysts were used, for the first time, to investigate the detoxification of chlorobenzenes in a glass capillary microreactor. High potential (in kV range) was applied to a reaction mixture containing buffer solution in the presence of catalyst. Due to high potential, hydroxyl and hydrogen radicals were produced, and the reaction was monitored by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The main advantage of this capillary reactor is the in situ generation of hydrogen for the detoxification of chlorobenzene. Various experimental conditions influencing detoxification were optimized.

These studies indicate continuous restructuring of the metal substrate and the adsorbate molecules, changes of oxidation states with NP size and surface composition variations of bimetallic NPs with changes of reactant molecules.

One of the {{signatures}} observed in amino acid sequences from the ribokinase familiy members is the NXXE motif, which locates at the active site in the ribokinase fold. It {{has been suggested that}} the effect of Mg 2 + and phosphate ions on enzymatic activity, observed in several adenosine kinases and ribokinases, would be a widespread feature in the ribokinase family, with the conserved amino acid residues in the NXXE motif playing a role in the binding of these ions at the active site [Maj, M. C., et al. (2002) Biochemistry 41, 4059 - 4069]. In this work we study the effect of Mg 2 + and phosphate ions on Pfk- 2 activity and the involvement of residue E 190 from the NXXE motif in this behavior. The kinetic data are in agreement with the requirement of a Mg 2 + ion, besides the one present in the metal-nucleotide complex, for catalysis in the wild-type enzyme. Since the response to free Mg 2 + concentration is greatly affected in the E 190 Q mutant, we conclude that this residue is required for the proper binding of the catalytic Mg 2 + ion at the active site. The E 190 Q mutant presents a 50 -fold decrease in the kcat value and a 15 -fold increment in the apparent Km for MgATP 2 -. Inorganic phosphate, typically considered an activator of adenosine kinases, ribokinases, and phosphofructokinases (nonhomologous to Pfk- 2) acted as an inhibitor of wild-type and E 190 Q mutant Pfk- 2. We suggest that phosphate can bind to the allosteric site of Pfk- 2, producing an inhibition pattern qualitatively similar to MgATP 2 -, which can be reversed to some extent by increasing the concentration of fructose- 6 -P. Given that the E 190 Q mutant presents alterations in the inhibition by MgATP 2 - and phosphate, we conclude that the E 190 residue has a role not <b>only</b> in <b>catalysis</b> but also in allosteric regulation.

Here, we report the first crystal structure of DAPAL from Escherichia coli (EcDAPAL) in tetragonal and monoclinic forms at 2. 0 and 2. 2 angstrom resolutions, respectively. Structures of EcDAPAL soaked with substrates were also determined. EcDAPAL has a typical fold type II PLP-dependent enzyme topology consisting of a large and a small domain with the active site at the interface of the two domains. The enzyme is a homodimer with a unique biological interface not observed earlier. Structure of the enzyme in the tetragonal form had PLP bound at the active site, whereas the monoclinic structure was in the apo-form.

Incorporating finite rate chemistry at the surface is increasingly becoming a necessity for various applications such as high speed re-entry flows over thermal protection systems (TPS), micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), surface catalysis, etc. In the recent years, relatively few works have examined finite-rate surface reaction modeling using the DSMC method. In this work, a generalized finite-rate surface chemistry framework incorporating a comprehensive list of reaction mechanisms is developed and implemented into the DSMC solver SPARTA. The various mechanisms include adsorption, desorption, Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH), Eley-Rideal (ER), Collision Induced (CI), condensation, sublimation, etc. The approach is to stochastically model the various competing reactions occurring {{on a set of}} active sites. Both gas-surface (e. g., ER, CI) and pure-surface (e. g., LH, desorption) reaction mechanisms are incorporated. The reaction mechanisms could also be catalytic or surface altering based on the participation of the bulk-phase species (e. g., bulk carbon atoms). Marschall and MacLean developed a general formulation in which multiple phases and surface sites are used and we adopt a similar convention in the current work. Microscopic parameters of reaction probabilities (for gas-surface reactions) and frequencies (for pure-surface reactions) that are require for DSMC are computed from the surface properties and macroscopic parameters such as rate constants, sticking coefficients, etc. The energy and angular distributions of the products are decided based on the reaction type and input parameters.

For the internal combustion engine, the most promising of these include gasoline direct injection, downsizing and fully variable valve trains. While new types of spray-guided gasoline direct injection (GDI) combustion systems are finally set to yield the level of fuel consumption improvement which was originally promised for the so-called 'first generation' wall- and air-guided types of GDI, injectors for spray-guided combustion systems are not yet in production to help justify the added complication and cost of the NOx trap necessary with a stratified combustion concept. Conversely, hardware suitable for homogeneous combustion systems is available now and this approach offers the advantage that simple three-way <b>catalysis</b> <b>only</b> needs to be used for exhaust gas aftertreatment. This in turn means that homogeneous GDI is a technology applicable to a world-wide market, because NOx traps are susceptible to poisoning by sulphur, such as is to be found in high concentrations in US gasolines. Advanced mechanically-variable valve trains are in production now, which considerably reduce pumping losses in the 4 -stroke engine over the conventional 'variable density' type of throttling. Fully variable valve trains are being developed to production, too. These technologies allow throttling loss to be addressed directly rather than by the more circuitous route of stratified charge combustion. While homogeneous combustion systems with load control by valve event may not offer the ultimate thermodynamic benefits of stratified charge, the fuel consumption improvement possibilities are still considerable, relative to a state-of-the-art port fuel injection engine. The present work discusses the start of the HOTFIRE consortium project which is a three-year programme to investigate the strong interactions and synergies between homogeneous GDI and fully variable valve train systems. Initial results from the consortium's high-speed optical access engine, fitted with a research fully variable valve train system, are presented.

40|$|Abstract Background The dengue virus two-component {{protease}} NS 2 B/NS 3 mediates {{processing of}} the viral polyprotein precursor {{and is therefore}} an important determinant of virus replication. The enzyme is now intensively studied {{with a view to}} the structure-based development of antiviral inhibitors. Although 3 -dimensional structures have now been elucidated for a number of flaviviral proteases, enzyme-substrate interactions are characterized only to a limited extend. The high selectivity of the dengue virus protease for the polyprotein precursor offers the distinct advantage of designing inhibitors with exquisite specificity for the viral enzyme. To identify important determinants of substrate binding and catalysis in the active site of the dengue virus NS 3 protease, nine residues, L 115, D 129, G 133, T 134, Y 150, G 151, N 152, S 163 and I 165, located within the S 1 and S 2 pockets of the enzyme were targeted by alanine substitution mutagenesis and effects on enzyme activity were fluorometrically assayed. Methods Alanine substitutions were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis at residues L 115, D 129, G 133, T 134, Y 150, G 151, N 152, S 163 and I 165 and recombinant proteins were purified from overexpressing E. coli. Effects of these substitutions on enzymatic activity of the NS 3 protease were assayed by fluorescence release from the synthetic model substrate GRR-amc and kinetic parameters K m, k cat and k cat / K m were determined. Results Kinetic data for mutant derivatives in the active site of the dengue virus NS 3 protease were essentially in agreement with a functional role of the selected residues for substrate binding and/or <b>catalysis.</b> <b>Only</b> the L 115 A mutant displayed activity comparable to the wild-type enzyme, whereas mutation of residues Y 150 and G 151 to alanine completely abrogated enzyme activity. A G 133 A mutant had an approximately 10 -fold reduced catalytic efficiency thus suggesting a critical role for this residue seemingly as part of the oxyanion binding hole. Conclusions Kinetic data obtained for mutants in the NS 3 protease have confirmed predictions for the conformation of the active site S 1 and S 2 pockets based on earlier observations. The data presented herein will be useful to further explore structure-activity relationships of the flaviviral proteases important for the structure-guided design of novel antiviral therapeutics. </p...|$|R

The structure with a transient reaction intermediate (aminoacrylate-PLP azomethine) bound at the active site was obtained from crystals soaked with substrate, DL-DAP. Apo and holo structures revealed that the region around the active site undergoes transition from disordered to ordered state and assumes a conformation suitable for <b>catalysis</b> <b>only</b> upon PLP binding. A novel disulfide was found to occur near a channel that is likely to regulate entry of ligands to the active site. Based on the crystal structures and biochemical studies, as well as studies on active site mutant enzymes, a two base mechanism of catalysis involving Asp 120 and Lys 77 is suggested. AcOAT is an enzyme of arginine biosynthesis pathway that catalyses the reversible conversion of N-acetylglutamate semialdehyde and glutamate to N-acetyl ornithine and α-ketoglutarate. It belongs to subgroup III of fold type I PLP dependent enzymes. Many clinically important aminotransferases belong to the same subgroup and share many structural similarities. We have carried out extensive comparative analysis of these enzymes to identify the unique features important for substrate specificity. Crystal structures of AcOAT from Salmonella typhimurium were determined in presence of two ligands, canaline and gabaculine, which are known to act as general inhibitors for most of the enzymes of this class. There structures provided important insights into the mode of binding of the substrates. The structures illustrated the switching of conformation of an active site glutamate side chain on binding of the two substrates. In addition to that, structural transitions involving three loop regions near the active site were observed in different ligand bound structures. Kinetics of single turnover fast reactions and multiple turnover steady state reactions indicated that N-AcOAT dimer might follow a mechanism involving sequential half site reactivity for efficient catalysis. The changes observed in loop conformation that resulted in asymmetric forms of the dimer enzyme might form the structural basis for half site reactivity. Single site mutants were designed to understand the significance of these structural transitions and the specific role of active site residues in determining substrate specificity and catalysis. Biochemical characterization of wild type and mutant enzymes by steady state and fast kinetic studies, along with their crystal structures provided detailed insights into subtlety of active site features that manifest substrate specificity and catalytic activity. The thesis also describes the investigations on fold type II enzymes directed towards analyses of polypeptide folds of these enzymes, features of their active sites, nature of interactions between the cofactor and the polypeptide, oligomeric structure, catalytic activities with various ligands, origin of specificity and plausible regulation of activity. Analysis of the available crystal structures of fold type II enzymes revealed five different classes. The dimeric interfaces found in these enzymes vary across the classes and probably have functional significance. Contributions made towards structural and functional studies of three other PLP-dependent enzymes, serine hydoxymethyltransferase (SHMT), D-serine deaminase (DSD) and D-cysteine desulfhydrase (DCyD) are described in an appendix...|$|R
40|$|Diaminopropionate ammonia lyase (DAPAL) which {{belongs to}} the  class of PLP enzymes is {{reported}} only from prokaryotes. It {{is involved in the}} removal of two amino groups from its substrate, diaminopropionate, to form ammonia and pyruvate. DAPAL from Escherichia coli (eDAPAL) and Salmonella typhimurium (sDAPAL) was cloned, over expressed and purified using either affinity chromatography or conventional procedures. It was observed that eDAPAL (90 units / mg) was comparatively less active than sDAPAL (200 units / mg). Also the enzymes with the N-terminal His tag were found to be many fold less active than the enzymes without tag. DAPAL had a characteristic absorption maximum at 414 nm due to the Schiff`s linkage between PLP and the € - amino group of the active site lysine residue. The apoenzyme was prepared by reaction with L-cysteine, and the resulting thiazolidine complex was easily dialyzed. On reconstitution with PLP, complete regain of absorption spectrum and 60 % activity was seen. All the three enzymes (apo-, holo and reconstituted), when subjected to gel filtration chromatography were found to be homodimers of 88 kDa. The active site lysine 78 was mutated to glutamine, and the enzyme was purified to homogeneity. In the mutant enzyme PLP continued to be bound at the active site, but in a different orientation with an absorbance maximum at 406 nm. The K 78 Q enzyme had negligible activity as compared to the wild type enzyme confirming the role of K 78 in <b>catalysis.</b> 		 <b>Only</b> a few of the enzymes of the  class have been investigated for their unfolding pathways. Urea induced unfolding studies on sDAPAL revealed that at lower concentrations of urea there was a loss in activity due to the disruption of Schiff's linkage. No gross conformational changes were observed at these concentrations of urea as seen from fluorescence and gel filtration experiments. Increase in concentration of urea led to unfolding of the protein thereby causing a shift in fluorescence maximum from 340 nm to 357 nm due to the exposure of the buried tryptophans to the less hydrophobic environment. A considerable amount of aggregation was seen at intermediate urea concentrations, which was possibly the reason for the inability of the protein to refold completely. Based on the results, a concerted mechanism for dissociation and unfolding was proposed for sDAPAL. Aminooxy compounds, which are mechanism-based inhibitors for PLP enzymes have been used as drugs against various disorders for the last few decades. In order to probe the mechanism and efficiency with which these compounds inhibit sDAPAL, cycloserine (D and L), methoxyamine (MA) and aminooxyacetic acid (AAA) were chosen for the inhibition studies. The inhibition rates were measured by monitoring decrease in absorbance at 414 nm, increase in the range of 320 - 330 nm due to the product formation and loss of activity upon incubation with the inhibitor. It was seen that both the enantiomers of cycloserine were equally effective in disrupting the Schiff’s linkage with the second order rate constants of 15. 8 and 36 M - 1 sec – 1 respectively. Spectral measurements showed two isosbestic points in the case of DCS and one in the case of LCS. Product of this inhibition reaction was identified to be a heat and acid stable compound namely a hydroxyisooxazole derivative of PMP. It was similar in nature to that reported from GABA aminotransferase. These results showed that unlike in the case of alanine racemase, sDAPAL could be inhibited equally well by both the enantiomers. The inhibition studies with the other two inhibitors namely AAA and MA, showed AAA to be more efficient at disrupting the Schiff’s linkage and causing inactivation of the enzyme. The visible absorbance spectrum showed a single isosbestic point in both the cases, indicative of a single step involved {{in the formation of the}} final product. The elution profile of the product of the enzymatic as well as non-enzymatic reactions on a C- 18 HPLC column was similar and the product was identified to be an oxime. These inhibitors reacted with sDAPAL many fold better than the other PLP dependent enzymes and therefore these compounds can serve as potential drugs for sDAPAL...|$|R
