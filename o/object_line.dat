To what extent the true history of this knot can be learned {{is a matter of}} speculation; knots books are notoriously bad at accuracy! Examination of such [...] "snood"/"gangion" [...] hitches in commercial fishing in the present day will show that it is typical to tuck the hitching line (the snood) through the lay of the <b>object</b> <b>line</b> - which, yes, implies that braided lines are not used here. In such cases, various simple hitches - e.g., the clove hitch, the ground line hitch - can be used, with the tucked tail providing security of the knot against both loosening and shifting position along the line. (E.g., in some areas, lobster fishing is done with long ground lines to which numerous lobster pots are connected via approximately 10'-long snoods. It is possible that the ground line will at times be hauled up from different ends, so hitches might need to endure pulls from either direction.

40|$|When 4 dots {{surround}} an unattended {{target and}} their offset is delayed {{relative to the}} target's offset, the non-overlapping trailing dots act as a mask. This phenomenon is known as object substitution masking (OSM) (Enns and Di Lollo, 1997 Psychological Science 8 135 - 139), but so far had not been demonstrated for realistic objects. We used 26 ms exposures of circular arrays of 8 <b>object</b> <b>line</b> drawings, displayed at 4 ° eccentricity. During presentation, one object (target) was surrounded by 4 dots. After 26 ms, all objects disappeared, while the dots remained on for durations ranging from 0 ms (common offset) to 300 ms.

This effect occurred even in the common offset condition, indicating that set size did not increase target - distractor confusion after display offset. Instead, it affected target discrimination before display offset, as suggested by a more adverse effect of closer distractors. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a method is {{presented}} for {{the estimation of}} interior orientation parameters and lens distortion using measurements of lines in a single image and constraints derived from a priori information on {{the orientation of the}} related <b>object</b> <b>lines.</b> The interior orientation parameters consist of the location of the principle point and the focal length. Radial lens distortion is modeled with one parameter. The straight image lines are extracted automatically using a line-growing algorithm. The constraints on the orientation of the <b>object</b> <b>lines</b> are parallelism and perpendicularity constraints. These constraints are specified automatically using a vanishing point detection algorithm. The two-step procedure starts with the least-squares estimation of the lens distortion using only parallelism constraints. In this step, the image line observations are checked for blunders and their precision is assessed. In the second step, the principal point and the focal length are estimated using adjusted observations from the first step and constraints for perpendicularity in addition to the parallelism constraints. The formal precision of the parameters results from propagation of variances. The precision turned out to be in the order of 0. 1 mm for the tests performed with wide-angle imagery (focal length 9. 2 mm, sensor size 8. 6 x 6. 9 mm) ...|$|R

To jam the radars, we need to transmit the jamming signals in proper direction. The jamming signals include high power noise or delayed RF pulses. The high power noise is generated and is transmitted through ECM antenna. To make the jamming more effective, the transmitting antenna has to be positioned to the desired direction during jamming. Thus we need auto track receiver to position the jamming antenna in the desired direction during jamming. The tracking {{has to be done}} automatically in the direction of radar signals with good tracking accuracy to have effective jamming. This can happen only through high speed tracking receiver circuits and suitable algorithm. A set of antennas receive RF signals radiated by radars. The RF signals received by the antennas are given to the down converters which converts the high frequency of RF signal to low frequencies, i. e., IF signals.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{present a}} {{complete}} processing line to enhance large Remote Sensing (RS) image databases {{in the framework}} of real-time 3 D rendering. RS and Virtual Reality communities are faced to several challenges to deal in real-time with large image datasets while preserving high quality and realistic rendering. There is an increasing interest of InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) data, due to principally with the availability of a near global coverage of HR DEM with the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). Important improvements of DEM are needed to provide more realistic visualizations. DEM pre-processing are performed by exploiting only the couple of data required for 3 D visualization. A non stationary bayesian filter is presented to remove noise and small artifacts which pervade the InSAR DEM while preserving structural information. To produce more realistic rendering, information from optical images are fused in the DEM data. An object based description of large optical Remote Sensing (RS) images is obtained in two stages. (i) The optical image is segmented to simplify the amount of data. (ii) A novel dynamical algorithm is proposed to extract the regions and geometry which are stored in a tree structure that defines spatial relationships between regions (e. g. adjacencies, inclusions). An interactive object selection procedure links the extracted objects to their elevation modeling. The objects 3 D structure is estimated from the DEM data using its planimetric shape extracted from the optical image and the elevation modeling assigned. The proposed <b>object</b> <b>line</b> processing provides more realistic 3 D visualizations. ...|$|E
40|$|We present {{near and}} {{mid-infrared}} {{observations of the}} pulsar-wind nebula (PWN) B 0540 - 69. 3 and its associated supernova remnant made with the Spitzer Space Telescope. We report detections of the PWN with all four IRAC bands, the 24 μm band of MIPS, and the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS). We find no evidence of IR emission from the X-ray/radio shell surrounding the PWN resulting from the forward shock of the supernova blast wave. The flux of the PWN itself is dominated by synchrotron emission at shorter (IRAC) wavelengths, with a warm dust component longward of 20 μm. We show that this dust continuum {{can be explained by}} a small amount (∼ 1 - 3 × 10 ^- 3) of dust at a temperature of ∼ 50 - 65 K, heated by the shock wave generated by the PWN being driven into the inner edge of the ejecta. This is evidently dust synthesized in the supernova. We also report the detection of several lines in the spectrum of the PWN, and present kinematic information about the PWN as determined from these lines. Kinematics are consistent with previous optical studies of this <b>object.</b> <b>Line</b> strengths are also broadly consistent with what one expects from optical line strengths. We find that lines arise from slow (∼ 20 km s^- 1) shocks driven into oxygen-rich clumps in the shell swept-up by an iron-nickel bubble, which have a density contrast of ∼ 100 - 200 relative to the bulk of the ejecta, and that faster shocks (∼ 250 km s^- 1) in the hydrogen envelope are required to heat dust grains to observed temperatures. We infer from estimates of heavy-element ejecta abundances that the progenitor star was likely in the range of 20 - 25 M_. Comment: 46 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in Ap...|$|E

They allow exploring and studying {{the properties of the}} transformed object using the properties of the original <b>object</b> (<b>line,</b> surface and figure) and the properties of the transformation. Cremona transformations occupy a special place in the set of one-to-one nonlinear transformations. Construction of one-parameter (stratifiable) transformations is carried out as one-parameter set of plane transformations, both linear and non-linear ones. The plane, in which the specific transformation is prescribed, moves in space by a certain law forming a one-parameter set of planes. The set of such plane transformations makes up the space transformation. Findings. The designed graphics algorithms and the established transformation equations allow building the visual images of transformed surfaces and conducting their research by analytical geometry methods. Originality. By completing elementary algebraic transformations of this equation, we obtain the cissoids equation. If the plane is continuously moved parallel to itself, it results in occurrence of surface, whose carcass will be the set of cissoids and the set of front-projecting lines. Practical value. The considered set of stratifiable algebraic transformations gives an effective means for exploring new curves and surfaces obtained by transforming the known algebraic lines and surfaces. These graphic algorithms allow graphically depicting the transformed lines and surfaces. The considered procedure of drawing up analytical formulas of specific transformations allows us to study the transformed surfaces and lines using the methods of analytic geometry. The above transformations can be of arbitrary high order, which is especially important during the design of complex technical surfaces such as aircraft components, parts of water and gas turbines, supports of the structures subject to strong flow of liquid, etc. Space modelling issues, including the building of graphic plane models of space, are relevant both in theoretical terms and in terms of application of the non-linear surfaces investigated on their basis for constructing the technical forms of parts and aggregates of construction machine movable elements, the middle surfaces of shells, the surfaces of turbulent blade, etc...|$|E
40|$|An epsilon-approximate {{incidence}} {{between a}} point and some geometric <b>object</b> (<b>line,</b> circle, plane, sphere) {{occurs when the}} point and the object lie at distance at most epsilon from each other. Given a set of points {{and a set of}} objects, computing the approximate incidences between them is a major step in many database and web-based applications in computer vision and graphics, including robust model fitting, approximate point pattern matching, and estimating the fundamental matrix in epipolar (stereo) geometry. In a typical approximate incidence problem of this sort, we are given a set P of m points in two or three dimensions, a set S of n objects (lines, circles, planes, spheres), and an error parameter epsilon> 0, and our goal is to report all pairs (p,s) in P times S that lie at distance at most epsilon from one another. We present efficient output-sensitive approximation algorithms for quite a few cases, including points and lines or circles in the plane, and points and planes, spheres, lines, or circles in three dimensions. Several of these cases arise in the applications mentioned above. Our algorithms report all pairs at distance 1. Our algorithms are based on simple primal and dual grid decompositions and are easy to implement. We note though that (a) the use of duality, which leads to significant improvements in the overhead cost of the algorithms, appears to be novel for this kind of problems; (b) the correct choice of duality in some of these problems is fairly intricate and requires some care; and (c) the correctness and performance analysis of the algorithms (especially in the more advanced versions) is fairly non-trivial. We analyze our algorithms and prove guaranteed upper bounds on their running time and on the "distortion" parameter alpha. We also briefly describe the motivating applications, and show how they can effectively exploit our solutions. The superior theoretical bounds on the performance of our algorithms, and their simplicity, make them indeed ideal tools for these applications.
