5|$|Orcinus orca is {{the only}} {{recognized}} extant species in the genus Orcinus, one of many animal species originally described by Linnaeus in 1758 in Systema Naturae.

5|$|According to {{the comic}} book series Haunted, Adam was once a human member of the Initiative tasked with {{protecting}} Professor Walsh. The ghost of Mayor Richard Wilkins, however, took over {{the body of a}} vampire, which was then captured by the Initiative. Desperate to escape, the Mayor moved to the body <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> demon and killed Adam. Having been one of her favorite agents, Professor Walsh vowed to bring him back to life and placed his body in her 314 Project. However, due to the complex nature of the Buffyverse, this chain of events may not, in fact, be canonical.|$|E

5|$|At the school, Ged's skills inspire admiration {{among the}} {{teachers}} {{as well as}} students. He befriends an older student named Vetch, but generally remains aloof from his fellows. Another student, Jasper, acts condescendingly towards Ged and provokes the latter's proud nature. After Jasper needles Ged during a feast, Ged challenges him to a duel. He casts a powerful spell intended to raise the spirit <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> woman, but the spell goes awry and releases a shadow creature, which attacks Ged and scars his face. The Archmage Nemmerle banishes the shadow and saves Ged's life, although it costs Nemmerle his own.|$|E
5|$|I {{found they}} begin the festivities of Christmas by a curious procession: {{a party of}} young people procure the head <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> horse, which is affixed to a pole about four feet in length; a string is affixed to the lower jaw; a horse-cloth is also {{attached}} to the whole, under {{which one of the}} parts gets, and by frequently pulling the string, keeps up a loud snapping noise, and is accompanied {{by the rest of the}} party, grotesquely habited, with hand-bells; they thus proceed from house to house, ringing their bells, and singing carols and songs; they are commonly gratified with beer and cake, or perhaps with money. This is called, provincially, a Hodening.|$|E

On March 27, 2008, Keyes's campaign website began displaying the Constitution Party's logo, along with a parody of the trademarked GOP logo in the form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> elephant. This appeared to be an indication of Keyes's intentions to quit the Republican party and to begin officially seeking the Constitution Party's presidential nomination.|$|E

The two confiscate a live tropical fish from the murder scene <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> drug dealer. Upon learning it will not used as evidence, Munch decides to give it {{as a gift to}} Felicia, who loves fish. However, she breaks up with Munch after the fish, a Jack Dempsey, ends up eating all her other fish. The now lonely Munch turns to Bolander for comfort, but finds the tables have turned and that Bolander has met a local waitress named Linda (Julianna Margulies). The two get along very well and bond over their mutual love of music. The episode ends with Linda and Bolander getting together to play music: Linda plays the violin, while Bolander plays the cello.|$|E
5|$|The series follows Shawn Spencer (James Roday) and his {{colleague}} and best friend Gus (Dulé Hill), who claim to operate a psychic detective agency. It is actually based on Shawn's hyperobservant ability. In the episode, the wife <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> bank robber is brought {{to the police station}} to be warned that her husband's partners are being released from prison. She hires Shawn and Gus to help her find the money that was stolen and never found. Shawn and Gus search for the money, and find that the husband was not actually dead. Shawn realizes where the money is, and tells the woman, who he later discovers is actually the criminal mastermind. Detective Carlton Lassiter (Timothy Omundson) arrests the woman, and Shawn finds the money.|$|E
5|$|The trailer was {{designed}} to be emotional, allowing players to care for the characters and to be distinct from trailers for the game's competitors. The trailer does not show any actual gameplay, instead telling a short story about the game's world and the background behind its events. The development team also had the goal to show the inevitability and the helplessness of a family in a zombie outbreak. Upon its release on February 16, 2011, the trailer sparked public interest, and the community reaction led Techland to adjust the content of the actual game. It was met with a mixed reception from critics. Praise was directed at the trailer's new ideas, story, immersion and tone, however, it received criticism for lacking gameplay information and its depiction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> child. The trailer received multiple awards upon release.|$|E

In Tomb of Horrors, the adventurers {{encounter a}} number of tricks and traps while attempting to penetrate the tomb <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> wizard. As the scenario begins, the players are told that the evil wizard Acererak is said to linger in his ancient tomb in undead form. Originally a powerful lich, he has (unbeknownst to the players) become a demi-lich, a more powerful form of undead that has transcended the need for any physical body apart from its skull. Player characters must survive the deadly traps in the tomb and fight their way into the demi-lich's elaborately concealed inner sanctum to destroy him once and for all.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{pressures}} of other projects, Jagger did not begin work on the memorial until the following year, by which time {{he had decided to}} alter the design. The revised memorial would be a third larger than before, cruciform in plan, and guarded by three bronze soldiers. Jagger initially intended to point the howitzer east, towards the Wellington Arch, but after much discussion—including advice from Lutyens and Sir Reginald Blomfield—it was agreed that the howitzer would point south to produce a pleasing silhouette from the park. A lengthy, year-long debate occurred within the RAWCF as to what inscription should be placed on the memorial, adding to the delay. Jagger then decided that the fourth side of the memorial should feature a dead soldier, a proposal which proved controversial. Although recumbent effigies were not uncommon on tombs and (to a lesser extent) war memorials, a sculpture <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> soldier at eye level was an unusual and dramatic feature among First World War memorials—architects often preferred abstract, classical designs (such as the Cenotaph) or portrayed death through allegory. Jagger was adamant about the inclusion, even offering to pay for the casting of the additional figure himself. After considerable debate, the RAWCF agreed to the modification. Jagger's work continued to take longer than planned, partially due to shortages of staff, the need to approve each amendment to the plan and practical problems on the site itself. The names of his models for three of the statues are known: William Fosten for the Driver, another ex-gunner called Metcalfe for the Ammunition Carrier, and Lieutenant Eugene Paul Bennett, VC, who fought in the same regiment as Jagger.|$|E
5|$|Ethnologists and anthropologists {{who study}} myths have {{developed}} various classification schemes {{for the various}} themes that appear in creation stories. For example, in one type of story, the world is born from a world egg; such stories include the Finnish epic poem Kalevala, the Chinese story of Pangu or the Indian Brahmanda Purana. In related stories, the Universe is created by a single entity emanating or producing something by him- or herself, as in the Tibetan Buddhism concept of Adi-Buddha, the ancient Greek story of Gaia (Mother Earth), the Aztec goddess Coatlicue myth, the ancient Egyptian god Atum story, and the Judeo-Christian Genesis creation narrative in which the Abrahamic God created the Universe. In another type of story, the Universe is created from the union {{of male and female}} deities, as in the Maori story of Rangi and Papa. In other stories, the Universe is created by crafting it from pre-existing materials, such as the corpse <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> god— as from Tiamat in the Babylonian epic Enuma Elish or from the giant Ymir in Norse mythology– or from chaotic materials, as in Izanagi and Izanami in Japanese mythology. In other stories, the Universe emanates from fundamental principles, such as Brahman and Prakrti, the creation myth of the Serers, or the yin and yang of the Tao.|$|E

5|$|The {{first real}} {{progress}} toward a modern understanding of nervous function, though, came from the investigations of Luigi Galvani, who discovered that a shock of static electricity applied to an exposed nerve <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> frog could cause its leg to contract. Since that time, each major advance in understanding has followed more or less directly from {{the development of a}} new technique of investigation. Until the early years of the 20th century, the most important advances were derived from new methods for staining cells. Particularly critical was the invention of the Golgi stain, which (when correctly used) stains only a small fraction of neurons, but stains them in their entirety, including cell body, dendrites, and axon. Without such a stain, brain tissue under a microscope appears as an impenetrable tangle of protoplasmic fibers, in which it is impossible to determine any structure. In the hands of Camillo Golgi, and especially of the Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal, the new stain revealed hundreds of distinct types of neurons, each with its own unique dendritic structure and pattern of connectivity.|$|E
5|$|While the Grand Prince is away in Lithuania, his power-hungry {{younger brother}} forms an {{allegiance}} {{with a group}} of Tatars and raids Vladimir. We see flashbacks of the Grand Prince and his brother attending a religious service in the church, and see the rivalry and animosity between them. The invasion of the combined armed forces on horseback and the resulting carnage is shown in great detail. The city is burned, the citizens are murdered and women raped and killed. One scene shows a horse falling from a flight of stairs and being stabbed by a spear. Another shows a cow being set on fire. Foma narrowly escapes being killed in the city and escapes into the nearby countryside, but as he is crossing a river he is shot in the back with an arrow and killed. The Tatars force their way into the barricaded church, now fully decorated with Andrei's paintings, where the majority of the citizens have taken refuge. The Tatars show no mercy and massacre the people inside and burn all the painted wooden altarpieces. Andrei saves Durochka from being raped by killing a Tatar with an axe. The Bishop's messenger is cruelly tortured to make him reveal the location of the city's gold, which he refuses to do. After being repeatedly burned, he has liquid metal from a melted crucifix poured into his mouth and is dragged away tied to a horse. In the aftermath only Andrei and Durochka are left alive in the church. Andrei imagines a conversation with the dead Theophanes the Greek, lamenting the loss of his work and the evil of mankind, while Durochka distractedly plaits the hair <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> woman. Andrei decides to give up painting and takes a vow of silence to atone for killing another man.|$|E
