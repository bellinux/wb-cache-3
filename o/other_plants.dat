5|$|Although it is toxic {{in large}} doses, {{selenium}} {{is an essential}} micronutrient for animals. In plants, it occurs as a bystander mineral, sometimes in toxic proportions in forage (some plants may accumulate selenium as a defense against being eaten by animals, but <b>other</b> <b>plants,</b> such as locoweed, require selenium, and their growth indicates the presence of selenium in soil).

5|$|It {{has been}} stated that sperm whales, {{as well as}} other large cetaceans, help {{fertilise}} the surface of the ocean by consuming nutrients in the depths and transporting those nutrients to the oceans' surface when they defecate, an effect known as the whale pump.

5|$|It is a hairy {{biennial}} {{plant that}} can grow to 2 m tall or more. Its small, yellow flowers are densely grouped on a tall stem, which grows {{from a large}} rosette of leaves. It grows {{in a wide variety}} of habitats, but prefers well-lit, disturbed soils, where it can appear soon after the ground receives light, from long-lived seeds that persist in the soil seed bank. It is a common weedy plant that spreads by prolifically producing seeds, but it rarely becomes aggressively invasive, since its seeds require open ground to germinate. It is a very minor problem for most agricultural crops, since it is not a very competitive species, being intolerant of shade from <b>other</b> <b>plants</b> and unable to survive tilling. It also hosts many insects, some of which can be harmful to <b>other</b> <b>plants.</b> Although individuals are easy to remove by hand, populations are difficult to eliminate permanently.|$|E
40|$|Factors that {{influenced}} {{the increase in}} epiphytic bacterial population size on navel orange leaves during winter months were investigated to test the assumption that such populations {{were the result of}} multiplication on orange leaves. The population sizes of bacteria of different kinds, including ice nucleation-active (Ice 1) bacteria, were from 6 - to 30 -fold larger on leaves of navel orange trees adjacent to <b>other</b> <b>plant</b> species than on trees growing near other citrus species. Total and Ice 1 bacterial population sizes on <b>other</b> <b>plant</b> species growing near navel orange trees were from 18 - to 60 -fold and 2 - to 18, 000 -fold larger, respectively, than on navel orange trees. About twice the number of bacterial cells of a given type were deposited onto petri dishes opened simultaneously in navel orange orchards with <b>other</b> <b>plant</b> species nearby as in orchards surrounded by citrus trees. Epiphytic bacteria and airborne bacteria were more numerous near the upwind edge of orchards bordering on <b>other</b> <b>plant</b> species, but not in orchards adjacent to other citrus trees, and decreased with distance from <b>other</b> <b>plant</b> species. Navel orange leaves also exhibited progressive increases in the ability to supercool as a function of increasing distance from the upwind edge of orchards adjacent to <b>other</b> <b>plant</b> species but not in orchards adjacent to other citrus trees. While the population size of three different bacterial strains remained nearly constant for 60 days after inoculation, total bacterial populations increased more than 50 -fold during this period. These results suggest that immigration of bacteria from plants having high epiphytic bacteria...|$|R
