25|$|The Brenton Butler case (officially State of Florida v. Brenton Leonard Butler) was {{a murder}} case in Jacksonville, Florida. During the {{investigation}} of a shooting death outside a motel in 2000, police arrested 15-year-old Brenton Butler and charged him with the murder. Butler subsequently confessed to the crime, and the case went to trial. However, during the trial he testified {{that he had been}} brutalized into his confession, and he was acquitted. The case gained significant notice in the media, and became the subject of an award-winning documentary, Murder <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>Morning.</b>|$|E

Two days later, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning,</b> Rankin witnessed the lynching of Perkins {{at the hands of}} a vigilante mob who hung Perkins from the rafters of the Piper stage. The mob also pulled out their guns and shot Perkins' dangling body.|$|E
25|$|Morey's first patent, in 1793, {{was for a}} steam-powered spit, but he had grander plans. Morey {{realized}} that steam could be a power source in the 1780s, and he probably appreciated a steamboat’s potential from work on his father’s ferry and the locks he designed along the Connecticut river. In the early 1790s he fitted a paddle wheel and steam engine to a small boat and powered {{it up and down}} the Connecticut River. Legend has it, this was done <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning,</b> when the town was at church, to avoid ridicule if he failed.|$|E

While attending services with {{the other members of}} their rural Georgia community, Celie goes into labor and is dragged out of the church as the congregation quietly looks on ("Huckleberry Pie/Mysterious Ways"). After Celie gives birth to a son, her father takes the child away and bluntly tells her he is {{going to get rid of}} it like the last one. Celie quietly says goodbye to her newborn and asks God for a sign ("Somebody Gonna Love You").|$|E
25|$|Ahern {{dissolved}} the Dáil in April 2007 {{and called}} an election for 24 May 2007. Unusually, Ahern dissolved the Dáil <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning,</b> claiming that President McAleese's foreign trip that week made it necessary despite the trip having been long-planned. There was {{speculation that the}} timing was instead motivated by the commencement of the Mahon Tribunal's Quarryvale module scheduled for that week, particularly Tom Gilmartin's evidence - the hearing thus had to be postponed {{until after the election}} was over. Ahern's party received 78 seats a loss of three seats from the 2002 election result. This was regarded as a Fianna Fáil 'victory', as questions about Ahern's finances overshadowed {{the early part of the}} election campaign, which threatened to cause huge losses for Ahern's party. His partners in the government, the Progressive Democrats suffered a reduction in representation from 8 to 2 seats including the loss of their leader.|$|E
500|$|During {{the scene}} where Mulder wanders the deserted city, the {{production}} crew had to shut down eight blocks of downtown Los Angeles.

Luckily, using digital technology, the man was erased from the final cut of the scene.|$|E

500|$|To {{help create}} a world with no people, some scenes were shot very early <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning,</b> {{including}} a sequence where Al Sadiq drives [...] his car at speed around the city centre. Producer Hugh Warren said this approach reduced the amount of computer-generated imagery required and allowed the budget {{to be spent on}} effects such as when the city starts to flood and burn. Other locations included a house near Helmshore in Lancashire, which doubled as the survivors' main base; the disused Earth Centre in the village of Denaby Main near Doncaster; and the Jaguar Cars test track in Nuneaton, which stood in for deserted motorways.|$|E

50|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Popescu and Cornilescu, several hundred followers built a 1000-seat mother church in 1926, which still drew close to eight hundred worshipers <b>on</b> <b>an</b> average <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> in the early 1990s. At the request of government authorities, some of whom Popescu deeply impressed, the new movement registered as an association in 1927 and, {{in order to be}} distinguished from other groups, took the name Christians of the Scriptures. Shortly thereafter, churches opened in Ploieşti, Câmpulung, Târgovişte, Rucăr, Buzău, Piteşti, Bârlad, Braşov and other places.|$|R
50|$|In {{regard to}} vestments, the Directory for Worship leaves that {{decision}} {{up to the}} ministers. Thus, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> given <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> service, <b>a</b> congregation may see the minister leading worship in street clothes, Geneva gown, or an alb. Among the Paleo-orthodoxy and emerging church Presbyterians, clergy are {{moving away from the}} traditional black Geneva gown and reclaiming not only the more ancient Eucharist vestments of alb and chasuble, but also cassock and surplice (typically a full length Old English style surplice which resembles the Celtic alb, an ungirdled liturgical tunic of the old Gallican Rite).|$|R
500|$|Four {{months after}} the Birmingham {{campaign}} settlement, someone bombed the house of NAACP attorney Arthur Shores, injuring {{his wife in the}} attack. On September 15, 1963, Birmingham again earned international attention when Ku Klux Klan members bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> and killed four young girls. [...] FBI informant Gary Thomas Rowe was hired to infiltrate the KKK and monitor their activities and plans. Rowe was involved with the help of Birmingham Police into the KKK attacks on the Freedom Riders, led by Fred Shuttlesworth, in Anniston, Alabama on May 14, 1961. In addition, Rowe and several other Klansmen also partook in the killing of Civil Rights activist Viola Liuzzo on March 25, 1965, in Lowndes County, Georgia after the Selma to Montgomery march.|$|E
500|$|Delorentos twice {{toured the}} United States during this time, {{including}} several dates in March 2008. The Irish Times selected their South by Southwest performance in Austin, Texas in March 2008 {{as the best}} by any Irish act at the event. The band also performed at the Razz Club in Barcelona, Spain. However, they kept a low enough profile on the Irish live circuit {{for much of the}} year, only performing at a small number of festivals, including Oxegen, the Bandon Music Festival and the Drogheda Arts Festival. The Irish Times noted their performance in Pet Sounds on the Sunday of Oxegen 2008 by reminiscing upon their performance from two years previously in front of a smaller crowd early <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning.</b> Performances of the singles [...] "Basis of Everything" [...] and [...] "The Rules" [...] at Oxegen 2008 were described as having [...] "the kind of hummable sheen that sounds as perfect at a festival as on the radio".|$|E
500|$|After leaving Connecticut <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> in 2007 for Monday Night Football in Pittsburgh, Scott had a {{stomachache}}. After the stomachache worsened, {{he went to}} {{the hospital}} instead of the game and later had his appendix removed. After testing the appendix, doctors learned that he had cancer. Two days later, he had surgery in New York that removed part of his colon and some of his lymph nodes near the appendix. After the surgery, they recommended preventive chemotherapy. By December, Scott—while undergoing chemotherapy—hosted Friday night ESPN NBA coverage and led the coverage of ABC's NBA Christmas Day studio show. Scott worked out while undergoing chemotherapy. Scott said of his experience with cancer at the time: [...] "One of the coolest things about having cancer, and I know that sounds like an oxymoron, is meeting other people who've had to fight it. You have a bond. It's like a fraternity or sorority." [...] When Scott returned to work and people knew of his cancer diagnosis, the well-wishers felt overbearing for him as he just wanted to talk about sports, not cancer.|$|E

Dobson continued his regular printings until a fire destroyed his business and stock <b>on</b> <b>an</b> early <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning,</b> 8 September 1793; {{the heat of the}} fire was sufficient to melt much of his metal print parts.
