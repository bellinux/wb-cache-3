5|$|In 1981, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry {{set aside}} $850 {{million for the}} Fifth {{generation}} computer project. Their <b>objectives</b> <b>were</b> to write programs and build machines that could carry on conversations, translate languages, interpret pictures, and reason like human beings. Much {{to the chagrin of}} scruffies, they chose Prolog as the primary computer language for the project.|$|E
5|$|On 6 June 1944, the 6th Airborne Division {{landed in}} Normandy {{to secure the}} left flank of the British landing zone. The division's <b>objectives</b> <b>were</b> to capture intact the Caen canal bridge, the Orne river bridge, destroy the Merville gun battery– which was in a {{position}} to engage troops landing at the nearby Sword– and the bridges crossing the River Dives, the latter to prevent German reinforcements approaching the landings from the east.|$|E
5|$|Security {{concerns}} dominated Soviet decisions {{concerning the}} Far East. Chief among these was gaining unrestricted {{access to the}} Pacific Ocean. The year-round ice-free areas of the Soviet Pacific coastline—Vladivostok in particular—could be blockaded by air and sea from Sakhalin island and the Kurile Islands. Acquiring these territories, thus guaranteeing free access to the Soya Strait, was their primary objective. Secondary <b>objectives</b> <b>were</b> leases for the Chinese Eastern Railway, Southern Manchuria Railway, Dairen, and Port Arthur.|$|E
50|$|The Common <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> {{to conquer}} 30 countries; this <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> {{the same for}} all players.|$|R
50|$|Goats' <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> to {{encircle}} Pulis so {{that none}} of the Pulis can move. Puli's <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> to kill All Goats.|$|R
50|$|Their first {{military}} <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> the gendarmerie post at Aguas Blancas, but {{the location}} was deemed unsuitable and another <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> not chosen.|$|R
5|$|The {{campaign}} effectively {{started on}} 20 September 1991, even though relatively minor offensive actions {{had already been}} undertaken. By {{the end of the}} month, it suffered from serious delays and manpower shortages caused by low call-up turnout in Serbia. In early October, the original campaign <b>objectives</b> <b>were</b> reduced as Serbian president Slobodan Milošević and his allies gained greater control of the JNA. Subsequently, the campaign <b>objectives</b> <b>were</b> redefined to deny the Croatian Government access to parts of Croatia that contained substantial Serb populations and to protect Croatian Serbs. The campaign culminated in late November and early December with the Battle of Vukovar and the Siege of Dubrovnik. A limited Croatian counterattack and the development of the HV led to a stalemate on the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{arrived at}} Rio de Janeiro around 14–18 August. It then passed the Cape of Good Hope. From here, rather than {{passing through the}} Indian Ocean and the Straits of Malacca, the fleet sailed south of Western Australia and through Bass Strait. The <b>objectives</b> <b>were</b> two-fold: to avoid French ships {{reported}} {{to be in the}} Indian Ocean, and to improve the charting of Bass Strait.|$|E
5|$|The {{specifications}} {{were approved}} by the Executive Committee on January 3, 1960, {{and sent to the}} government printing office, which printed these as COBOL 60. The language's stated <b>objectives</b> <b>were</b> to allow efficient, portable programs to be easily written, to allow users to move to new systems with minimal effort and cost, and to be suitable for inexperienced programmers.|$|E
40|$|The major {{accomplishments of}} the GEOS-B, C-band systems project is assessed. The project <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> given, namely: (1) primary <b>objectives</b> that must <b>be</b> met for project success; (2) {{secondary}} <b>objectives</b> that <b>were</b> sufficiently important to warrant serious consideration; and (3) other <b>objectives</b> that <b>were</b> important to the project and for which additional effort would be desirable. The primary <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> presented and discussed in detail...|$|R
40|$|This is the {{protocol}} {{for a review}} {{and there is no}} abstract. The <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> as follows: The primary <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> to review the health and well-being effects of welfare to work interventions on lone parents and their children. The secondary <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> to review the effects of welfare to work interventions on employment and income...|$|R
30|$|Feasible State S(1): When an <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> defined with {{sufficient}} information and enough resources {{to achieve the}} <b>objective</b> <b>are</b> available, then the requirement is in ‘feasible state’.|$|R
5|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{was that}} the North Vietnamese were planning to work both ends against the middle. This strategy {{has come to be}} known as the Option Play. If the NVA could take Khe Sanh, all well and good for them. If they could not, they would occupy the attention of as many American and South Vietnamese forces in I Corps as they could to facilitate the Tet Offensive. This view was supported by a captured (in 1969) North Vietnamese study of the battle. According to it, the NVA would have taken Khe Sanh if they could, but there were limits to the price they were willing to pay. Their main <b>objectives</b> <b>were</b> to inflict casualties on US troops and to isolate them in the remote border regions.|$|E
5|$|As a result, the Army Material Command (AMC) {{conducted}} a study {{to determine if the}} development <b>objectives</b> <b>were</b> feasible and also established a program office for the Fire-support Aerial System (FAS). AMC recommended to narrow the competition to compound helicopters, as they were considered the only helicopter configuration at the time capable of being developed to meet the objectives. In March 1964, the Secretary of the Army advised DDRE that modification of existing aircraft would not approach the required performance of the FAS program; the Army would continue using the armed UH-1B until development of the FAS could proceed.|$|E
5|$|By January 1974, a {{joint working}} party {{representing}} Greater Manchester had drawn up its county Structure Plan, ready for implementation by the Greater Manchester County Council. The plan set out objectives for the forthcoming metropolitan county. The highest priority was {{to increase the}} quality of life for its inhabitants by improving the county's physical environment and cultural facilities which had suffered following deindustrialisation—much of Greater Manchester's basic infrastructure dated from its 19th-century growth, and was unsuited to modern lifestyles. Other <b>objectives</b> <b>were</b> to reverse the trend of depopulation in central-Greater Manchester, to invest in country parks to improve the region's poor reputation on leisure facilities, and to improve the county's transport infrastructure and patterns.|$|E
30|$|Objectives: The primary <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> to {{identify}} {{risk factors for}} VAP related to ESBLE. Secondary <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> to determine the impact of ESBLE on outcome of VAP patients.|$|R
50|$|Their second <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> {{to secure}} their control of the Hunan-Guangxi and Guangzhou-Hankou railways. A third <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> to preemptively disrupt the planned Chinese {{offensive}} in the region.|$|R
50|$|While {{the concept}} of <b>objectives</b> <b>is</b> central in output orientation, the other four ideas (managerial {{effectiveness}}, effectiveness areas, measurement areas and authority areas) are the foundations of any <b>objectives</b> that <b>are</b> set; and only {{with an understanding of}} these will the <b>objectives</b> <b>be</b> sound.|$|R
5|$|From these positions, the New Zealanders {{were ordered}} to capture Belhamed, Sidi Rezegh proper and Ed Duda. This was to precede a renewed {{break-out}} offensive by the 70th Division. Scobie had informed Lieutenant-General Alfred Godwin-Austen, the XIII Corps commander, responsible for all operations near Tobruk, that the positions between him and Ed Duda were strongly defended. Godwin-Austen assured Scobie that he was {{under no obligation to}} attack until the New Zealand Division had taken Ed Duda. Undertaking a night assault, the New Zealand infantry captured Belhamed despite strong resistance, but their attacks to take their other <b>objectives</b> <b>were</b> repulsed.|$|E
5|$|General Archibald Wavell—the {{commander-in-chief}} of the British Middle East Command—conceived Operation Brevity as a rapid blow in the Sollum area. Wavell {{intended to}} create advantageous conditions {{from which to}} launch Operation Battleaxe, the main offensive that he was planning for June. Operation Brevity's primary <b>objectives</b> <b>were</b> to recapture the Halfaya Pass, to drive the enemy from the Sollum and Capuzzo areas, and to deplete Rommel's forces. A secondary objective was to advance toward Tobruk, although {{only as far as}} supplies would allow, and without risking the force committed to the operation.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, the United States {{initiated}} Operation Provide Relief (UNOSOM I) {{which was}} part of a United Nations (UN) endorsed effort called The Unified Task Force (UNITAF), to provide humanitarian relief. In August 1992, President George H. Bush sent, 25,000 US troops (mostly US Marines from I MEF) to the Republic of Somalia and the mission was renamed Operation Restore Hope, also known as UNOSOM II. Its main <b>objectives</b> <b>were</b> to provide humanitarian relief, initiate 'nation building', disarm the various factions, restore law and order, help the people set up a representative government, and restore the infrastructure.|$|E
30|$|Network client {{data are}} the {{messages}} exchanged in a service session {{and the corresponding}} <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> the violation of the confidentiality of the client whereas meta-data is information related to the client's location and service usage profile and the <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> the violation of {{the privacy of the}} client. Primarily, this <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> related to external adversaries and dishonest network operators.|$|R
40|$|The <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> as follows: The primary <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> {{to assess}} the effects of mass media {{interventions}} on reducing stigma related to mental health in terms of discrimination and prejudice compared to inactive controls. The secondary <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> to make comparisons of effectiveness based {{on the nature of}} the intervention, the type of the intervention, and the type of media...|$|R
50|$|The first Soviet {{atomic bomb}} test {{occurred}} on 29 August 1949 and the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) subsequently identified SAC's primary <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> to damage or destroy the Soviet Union's {{ability to deliver}} nuclear weapons. The JCS further defined SAC's secondary <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> to stop any Soviet advances into Western Europe, and its tertiary <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> the previous EWP 1-49 industrial mission.|$|R
5|$|In early 1863, Major General James Longstreet {{was given}} {{command of the}} Confederate Department of North Carolina and Southern Virginia. His <b>objectives</b> <b>were</b> to defend Richmond from attack from the southeast, forage for {{supplies}} in Union controlled southeastern Virginia and to dislodge the Union garrison at Suffolk. Longstreet began the Siege of Suffolk on April 11, 1863. The 6th Massachusetts occupied {{a position on the}} right of the Union defensive siege lines at a location called Fort Nansemond by the bank of the Nansemond River. For 22 days, the regiment engaged in frequent exchanges of fire with opposing forces though no significant assault was made by the Confederates.|$|E
5|$|On 22 June 1941, Germany, {{supported}} by Italy and Romania, invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, with Germany accusing the Soviets of plotting against them. They were joined shortly by Finland and Hungary. The primary targets of this surprise offensive were the Baltic region, Moscow and Ukraine, {{with the ultimate}} goal of ending the 1941 campaign near the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan line, from the Caspian to the White Seas. Hitler's <b>objectives</b> <b>were</b> to eliminate the Soviet Union as a military power, exterminate Communism, generate Lebensraum ("living space") by dispossessing the native population and guarantee access to the strategic resources needed to defeat Germany's remaining rivals.|$|E
5|$|Rubinstein's {{first step}} was to found the Russian Musical Society (RMS) in 1859. Its <b>objectives</b> <b>were</b> to educate people in music, {{cultivate}} their musical tastes and develop their talents in that area of their lives. The first priority of the RMS acted was to expose to the public the music of native composers. In addition to a considerable amount of Western European music, works by Mussorgsky and Cui were premiered by the RMS under Rubinstein's baton. A few weeks after the Society's premiere concert, Rubinstein started organizing music classes, which were open to everyone. Interest in these classes grew until Rubinstein founded the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in 1862.|$|E
5000|$|These five <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> {{the most}} central {{aspects of a}} {{sustainable}} and independent media system. Under each of these <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> seven to nine indicators defining how well a country achieves that <b>objective.</b> Each indicator <b>is</b> scored from 0 to 4.|$|R
30|$|If the {{protection}} <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> not met when all active systems are working mitigating measures or adjustment of {{the protection}} <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> needed. This {{is due to}} the fact that the protection <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> not met in the most beneficial circumstances for the scenario, and will therefore never be met unless something is changed. One could come to the conclusion that other mitigating measures are needed, the protection <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> set to high or the scenario considered was to severe, whatever the cause the process needs to be reevaluated with a change in some of these factors.|$|R
30|$|Objectives: Our primary <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> {{correlation}} between SIG (strong ion difference) in donor and graft function. Secondary <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> comparison between SIG and marginal graft criteria {{as a predictor}} for liver transplantation outcome.|$|R
5|$|The Auckland and Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiments {{advanced}} north along a Roman road, {{across a}} narrow plain between the Judean Hills to the west, but exposed to artillery {{fire on the}} eastern side across the Jordan River. The Auckland Mounted Rifle Regiment's objective was to capture the Damieh crossing from the north east, while the Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment's <b>objectives</b> <b>were</b> to make a frontal attack on El Makhruk, capture the headquarters of the Ottoman 53rd Division, and cut the Nablus road.|$|E
5|$|The attack would {{consist of}} a four-prong offensive. The 1st Mechanized Division would pass through the 7th and 14th Infantry Divisions to protect the flank of the 3rd Armored Division, which would provide a {{blocking}} force west of Khafji while the 5th Mechanized Division took the town. The 1st Mechanized and 3rd Armored divisions would then retire to Kuwait, while the 5th Mechanized Division would wait until the Coalition launched a counteroffensive. The principal <b>objectives</b> <b>were</b> to inflict heavy casualties on the attacking Coalition soldiers and take prisoners of war, who Saddam Hussein theorized would be an excellent bargaining tool with the Coalition.|$|E
5|$|The brigade's next {{operation}} {{was scheduled for}} early September 1944. Codenamed Comet, the plan called for the 1st Airborne Division's three brigades to land in the Netherlands and capture three river crossings. The first of these was the bridge over the River Waal at Nijmegen, the second the bridge over the River Maas at Grave and finally the River Rhine at Arnhem. The objective of the 4th Parachute Brigade would be the bridge at Grave. Planning for Comet was well advanced when on the 10September the mission was cancelled. Instead, a new operation, Market Garden, was proposed whose <b>objectives</b> <b>were</b> {{the same as those}} of Comet but would this time be carried out by three divisions of the 1st Allied Airborne Army.|$|E
30|$|The primary <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> {{to assess}} the gas {{interchange}} improvement with PP. The secondary <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> to compare the outcomes of these patients {{with those of the}} general population of our LT recipients.|$|R
40|$|The first <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> to {{investigate}} if intracellular and extracellular levels of {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) within the mouse aorta increase before or after diet-induced lesion formation. The second <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> {{to investigate}} if intracellular and extracellular ROS correlates to cell composition in atherosclerotic lesions. The third <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> to investigate if intracellular and extracellular ROS levels within established atherosclerotic lesions can be reduced by lipid lowering by diet or atorvastatin...|$|R
50|$|Commonly, a {{microscope}} <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> {{used to collect}} the object wave front. However, as the microscope <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> only used to collect light and not to form an image, it may {{be replaced by a}} simple lens. If a slightly lower optical resolution is acceptable, the microscope <b>objective</b> may <b>be</b> entirely removed.|$|R
