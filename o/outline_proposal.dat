He has also donated {{the cost of building}} the Life Sciences building at St Edward's School, Oxford and in July 2013 the building was formally named the Ogston Building. Through his support and further donations, St Edward's School has also been able to acquire a site for a new and much bigger music school, which has been named The Ogston Music School. Ogston has {{played a role in the}} rejuvenation of Rangoon General Hospital. At the behest of the Burmese leader of the opposition, Aung San Suu Kyi, Ogston held discussions with seven British university medical schools, to find one that would be prepared to rebuild the Hospital's healthcare system and provide a degree course for the brightest Burmese medical students.

40|$|The {{commercial}} exploitation of large scale computer-based systems inevitably requires {{support for the}} elicitation of payment (remuneration) from the consumers of {{the goods and services}} it provides. Unless service providers can benefit economically from the use which is made of the products they make available in an open distributed system there will be no service provision. The ability to support remuneration is thus fundemental to the creation of an electronic services market place. The roles, responsibilities, processes that constitute remuneration must be stated before the detailed mechanisms can be placed in a distributed system to support it, are are also required in order to derive the issues to be overcome when considering the federation of different remuneration regimes. This document presents an initial model outlining the roles, processes and information relevant to computer-based systems that incorporate a requirement for remuneration in exchange for goods and services and goes on to outline some possible consequences on the engineering infrastructure supporting the use of remunerated services including an <b>outline</b> <b>proposal</b> for the support of electronic payment...|$|E

Car stylists play a particular {{role in the}} concept stage of the design process. Key parts of their work have proved incompatible with computer-aided design (CAD) support, despite its advantages. The primary objective of the work described has been to devise techniques that provide effective CAD support for the stylists' concept design processes, without inhibiting the fluidity and richness of a sketch-based approach. Various methods for doing this have been developed and used by stylists and design students. The work on sketch mapping as a usable tool is described, and is contrasted with the more conventional direct modelling approach that is seen to have limitations. There is {{a brief description of}} work in progress on deriving forms directly from sketches. The extension of the resources available to support concept design through the use of non-concept scanning technology is described, and initial experiments illustrated.

40|$|International audienceThe {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to support early phase cost estimation for assembly systems design and automation decision. During this phase, various alternatives of assembly systems with different automation levels can be generated. The alternatives generation is performed using available information on product design, assembly sequences, and planned production information. The issue is to assess given alternatives, identify, and opt for the most appropriate one. Several criteria have to be considered in this decision. The economic aspect represents one of the most preponderant, including cost and profitability prediction. The importance and challenges of this complex issue are highlighted in this paper with feedbacks from manufacturers and the literature. The literature in the field is reviewed, presented, and analyzed. For this sake, a selection of cost models is performed covering a wide chronological range, journals, and fields including assembly and manufacturing models. Classification techniques of cost estimation works are presented and exploited in the proposed review. It is used to filter and discuss models suitability for the defined assembly automation decision issue. The most appropriate models are more thoroughly reviewed and discussed. Useful literature costing techniques, features, and relevant cost drivers are also identified. They cover multiple aspects as production information, resources features or performances. Finally, the review findings are illustrated by a cost estimation <b>outline</b> <b>proposal</b> to support early phase cost prediction for assembly systems design and automation decision...|$|E
