5|$|In the North, {{urbanization}} and {{an unprecedented}} influx {{of immigrants from}} Southern and Eastern Europe supplied a surplus of labor for the country's industrialization and transformed its culture. National infrastructure including telegraph and transcontinental railroads spurred economic growth and greater settlement {{and development of the}} American <b>Old</b> <b>West.</b> The later invention of electric light and the telephone would also affect communication and urban life.|$|E
5|$|Modern-day western gunslingers {{have also}} {{appeared}} in recent Neo-Westerns. Raylan Givens from the television series Justified shares the same ambiguous moral code of an <b>Old</b> <b>West</b> sheriff, even using a fast draw to dispatch his enemies. The hitman Anton Chigurh from No Country For Old Men shares many elements of a hunted outlaw. Additionally, the comic book character Vigilante is a self-proclaimed gunfighter born in the 1940s.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{nationwide}} attention the incident received, the Mussel Slough Tragedy is not remembered much today {{as well as}} later gunfights such as the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Richard Maxwell Brown argues in No Duty to Retreat that the Mussel Slough shootout did not fit the mold of the gunfight/hero myth, which usually ignores such factors as ideology, and social and economic conflict, thus not implanting it in the lore of the American <b>Old</b> <b>West.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} of the <b>Old</b> <b>West,</b> tales tended to grow with {{repeated}} telling, and a single fight might grow into a career-making reputation. For instance, the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral made legends of Wyatt Earp and the Outlaw Cowboy gang, but they were relatively minor figures before that conflict. Some gunslingers, such as Bat Masterson, actively engaged in self-promotion. Johnny Ringo built a reputation as a gunslinger while never taking part in a gunfight or killing unarmed civilians.|$|E

5|$|The Campbells {{continued}} {{to add to}} the castle, building a new house over the <b>old</b> <b>west</b> range in 1725. However, the rest of the castle was already decaying. In 1810 an accidental fire gutted the castle, and the Captains ceased to live here, moving to Dunstaffnage House, some 2km to the south-east, until this too burned down in 1940. Tenants lived in the 1725 house within the castle until 1888.|$|E

5|$|The Texas Ranger Division of the Texas Department of Public Safety {{is a law}} {{enforcement}} agency with statewide jurisdiction. Over the years, the Texas Rangers have investigated crimes ranging from murder to political corruption. They have acted as riot police and as detectives, protected the Texas governor, tracked down fugitives, and functioned as a paramilitary force both for the republic and the state. The Texas Rangers were unofficially created by Stephen F. Austin in 1823 and formally constituted in 1835. The Rangers were integral to several important events of Texas history {{and some of the}} best-known criminal cases {{in the history of the}} <b>Old</b> <b>West.</b>|$|E
5|$|The jackalope can {{imitate the}} human voice, {{according}} to legend. During {{the days of}} the <b>Old</b> <b>West,</b> when cowboys gathered by the campfires singing at night, jackalopes could be heard mimicking their voices or singing along, usually as a tenor. It is said that jackalopes, the rare Lepus antilocapra, only breed during lightning flashes and that their antlers make the act difficult despite the hare's reputation for fertility.|$|E
5|$|Tracy {{was absent}} from screens in 1946, {{the first year}} since his motion picture debut {{that there was no}} Spencer Tracy release. His next film was The Sea of Grass (1947) a drama set in the American <b>Old</b> <b>West</b> with Hepburn. Similarly to Keeper of the Flame and Without Love, a lukewarm {{response}} from critics did not stop it from being a financial success both at home and abroad. He followed it later that year with Cass Timberlane, in which he played a judge. It was a commercial success, but Curtis notes that co-star Lana Turner overshadowed Tracy in most of the reviews.|$|E

5|$|Ann Arbor's {{residential}} neighborhoods contain architectural styles {{ranging from}} classic 19th-century and early-20th-century designs to ranch-style houses. Among these homes {{are a number}} of kit houses built in the early 20th century. Contemporary-style houses are farther from the downtown district. Surrounding the University of Michigan campus are houses and apartment complexes occupied primarily by student renters. Tower Plaza, a 26-story condominium building located between the University of Michigan campus and downtown, is the tallest building in Ann Arbor. The 19th-century buildings and streetscape of the <b>Old</b> <b>West</b> Side neighborhood have been preserved virtually intact; in 1972, the district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and it is further protected by city ordinances and a nonprofit preservation group.|$|E
5|$|Fuller painted {{other works}} for the Hacketts. In a 1937 piece {{reflecting}} on early twentieth-century art in Western Australia, a reviewer recalled:Dr. (later Sir Winthrop) Hackett was a great patron of Miss Fuller, {{and he was a}} constant visitor to her dignified studio, above his office in the <b>old</b> <b>West</b> Australian Chambers. The first portrait I saw Miss Fuller working on was of Mrs. E. Chase... The portrait was a commission from Dr. Hackett, and was destined to hang in his gallery. Miss Fuller painted Lady Hackett both before and after her marriage, and one particularly happy picture of her is as a young girl gathering wildflowers in the Darlington hills. Her portraits of the first Hackett babies were charming studies of childhood.|$|E

Montana leads the series 72-38-5, but that margin is {{considerably}} smaller since Montana State joined the NCAA in 1957 at 32-27. The game, especially of late, has major implications on the Big Sky Conference championship and its automatic bid to the Division I FCS tournament.|$|R
