40|$|As {{part of the}} {{preliminary}} mission analysis of the Reusable Reentry Satellite (RRS) (planned for launching {{in the early to}} mid- 1990 s), the on-orbit attitude dynamics of the RRS were analyzed to quantify various parameters that would affect the attitude dynamics of the vehicle. The analysis simulated the attitude dynamics of the RRS due to aerodynamic forces coupled with the motion of the satellite moving around the orbit, estimated the levels of induced angular rates due to external disturbance torques while in orbit, and established the limits of operational <b>orbit</b> <b>altitudes.</b> The results show that, for a typical 60 -day mission, <b>orbit</b> <b>altitudes</b> above 350 km are necessary to prevent undesirable orbit decay, with about 200 km as the lower limit.

50|$|Although {{these are}} all named layers of the atmosphere, the {{pressure}} is so negligible that the chiefly-used definitions of outer space are actually below this altitude.

5000|$|QuickBird was a {{high-resolution}} commercial earth observation satellite, {{owned by}} DigitalGlobe launched in 2001 and [...] decayed in 2015. It {{was the first}} satellite in a constellation of three scheduled to be in orbit by 2008. QuickBird used Ball Aerospace's Global Imaging System 2000 (BGIS 2000). The satellite collected panchromatic (black and white) imagery at 61 centimeter resolution and multispectral imagery at 2.44- (at 450 km) to 1.63-meter (at 300 km) resolution, as <b>orbit</b> <b>altitude</b> is lowered during the end of mission life.|$|E

The received GPS signals can be used to investigate the ionospheric electron density and the atmosphere below FedSat&# 039;s <b>orbiting</b> <b>altitude,</b> using radio occultation (RO) techniques. The RO technique developed involves a simplified form of the Abel transform using the slant total electron content (STEC) determined from radio signals that traverse below FedSat&# 039;s <b>orbiting</b> <b>altitude.</b> Electron density profiles from the GPS RO data, recorded by the GPS receiver onboard the FedSat satellite, are determined for the first time.

50|$|An orbit {{can also}} decay by tidal effects when the {{orbiting}} body {{is large enough}} to raise a significant tidal bulge on the body it is orbiting and is either in a retrograde orbit or is below the synchronous orbit. The resulting tidal interaction saps momentum from the orbiting body and transfers it to the primary's rotation, lowering the <b>orbit's</b> <b>altitude</b> until frictional effects come into play.|$|R
40|$|Attempts {{to measure}} the ambient ionospheric plasma {{environment}} {{in the vicinity of}} the payload bay of the Space Shuttle Orbiter have shown that the plasma is quite different, in a variety of characteristics, from the ionospheric plasma at low earth <b>orbit</b> <b>altitudes.</b> It appears that the large size, complex geometry and various outgassing characteristics of a typical Orbiter payload can all contribute to modifications of the plasma environment of the Space Shuttle Orbiter. The measurements indicate that the plasma is often quite turbulent and contains populations more energetic than the ambient ionospheric plasma. Pronounced wake and ram effects have been observed, and at times the data can be interpreted as plasma number density enhancements of an order of magnitude or greater over the ambient, undisturbed plasma concentration. There is evidence that this enhanced plasma concentration contains molecular ions, not occurring naturally at low earth <b>orbit</b> <b>altitudes.</b> In addition to describing the observations, the electrodynamics of enhanced Orbiter-generated plasma and its possible impact on optical measurements from the Space Shuttle Orbiter will be discussed...|$|R
50|$|SNAP-10A was {{launched}} from Vandenberg Air Force Base by an ATLAS Agena D rocket on 3 April 1965 into a low Earth <b>orbit</b> <b>altitude</b> of approx. 1,300 km. It is {{in a slightly}} retrograde polar orbit— this ensured that the spent rocket stages landed in the ocean. Its nuclear electrical source, made up of thermoelectric elements, was intended to produce over 500 watts of electrical power for one year. After 43 days, an onboard voltage regulator within the spacecraft - unrelated to the SNAP reactor - failed, causing the reactor core to be shut down, after reaching a maximum output of 590 watts.|$|E

5000|$|If the {{manoeuvre}} from GTO to GEO is to {{be performed}} with a single impulse, as with a single solid rocket motor, apogee must occur at an equatorial crossing and at synchronous <b>orbit</b> <b>altitude.</b> This implies an argument of perigee of either 0 or 180 degrees. Because the argument of perigee is slowly perturbed by the oblateness of the Earth, it is usually biased at launch so that it reaches the desired value {{at the appropriate time}} (for example, this is usually the sixth apogee on Ariane 5 launches). If the GTO inclination is zero, as with Sea Launch, then this does not apply. (It also would not apply to an impractical GTO inclined at 63.4 degrees; see Molniya Orbit.) ...|$|E

40|$|Spacecraft design {{innovations}} enabled by nanosatellite, and CubeSat-based, missions {{often requires}} a greater-than-desirable amount of {{risk associated with}} space radiation design. The accelerating rate of technology advancement in this smaller form factor introduces more advanced / sensitive payloads wherefore a novel approach to radiation environment modeling and design is {{required in order to}} minimize risk associated with the development and deployment of advanced / strategic payloads. The space radiation dose to which spacecraft at Low Earth <b>Orbit</b> <b>altitudes</b> (for CubeSats typically 400 km to 800 km) are subjected is dominated by contributions from geomagnetically trapped protons (typical energy range 0. 1 MeV to 3 ̆e 100 MeV) and electrons (typical energy range 0. 1 MeV to 6. 0 MeV). The present paper describes a radiation design approach based upon commonly available design tools as well as proposes a novel mission concept, sufficiently executable via a low power 1 U vehicle, for purposes of characterizing the anisotropic total radiation dose at Low Earth <b>Orbit</b> <b>altitudes.</b> Analyses and discussions summarized herein demonstrate the importance of focusing on accurate determination of the radiation environment in the presence of spacecraft structure...|$|R

5000|$|An {{example of}} this is the International Space Station (ISS), which has an {{operational}} altitude above Earth's surface of between 330 and 410 km. Due to atmospheric drag the space station is constantly losing orbital energy. In order to compensate for this loss, which would eventually lead to a re-entry of the station, it has from time to time been re-boosted to a higher orbit. The chosen orbital altitude is a trade-off between the average thrust needed to counter-act the air drag and the delta-v needed to send payloads and people to the station. The upper limitation of <b>orbit</b> <b>altitude</b> is due to the constraints imposed by the Soyuz spacecraft. On 25 April 2008, the Automated Transfer Vehicle [...] "Jules Verne" [...] raised the orbit of the ISS for the first time, thereby proving its ability to replace (and outperform) the Soyuz at this task.|$|E
50|$|Ocean surface {{topography}} is {{also used}} to understand how the ocean moves heat around the globe, a critical component of Earth's climate, and for monitoring changes in global sea level. The sea surface height (SSH) is calculated through altimetry satellites, which determine the distance from the satellite to a target surface by measuring the satellite-to-surface round-trip time of a radar pulse. The satellites then measure the distance between their <b>orbit</b> <b>altitude</b> and the surface of the water. Due to the differing depths of the ocean, an approximation is made. This is called the Arbitrary Reference Surface. Arbitrary Reference Surface is an estimated surface that is calculated to factor {{in the shape of the}} Earth. The general shape of the earth is spherical, but flattened out at the North and South Pole. This approximated surface is called the reference ellipsoid. This enables data to be taken precisely due to the uniform surface level. The satellite’s altitude then has to be calculated with respect to the reference ellipsoid. It is calculated using the orbital parameters of the satellite and various positioning instruments. The sea surface height is then the difference between the satellite’s altitude relative to the reference ellipsoid and the altimeter range. The satellite sends microwave pulses to the ocean surface. The travel time of the pulses ascending to the oceans surface and back provides data of the sea surface height. In the image below you can see the measurement system using by the satellite Jason-1.|$|E

Portions of the total objects in geosynchronous orbit are tracked by ground stations while a significant number of additional pieces of space debris regularly pass through geosynchronous <b>orbit</b> <b>altitudes.</b> The probability of an operational satellite colliding with another satellite or a piece of space debris will {{increase in the number of}} space objects, their sizes, and on-orbit lifetimes...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} new theoretical results {{which lead}} to new algorithms for the computation of fuel-optimal multiple-burn orbit transfers of low and medium thrust. Theoretical results introduced herein show how to add burns to an optimal trajectory and show that the traditional set of necessary conditions may be replaced with a much simpler set of equations. Numerical results are presented {{to demonstrate the utility}} of the theoretical results and the new algorithms. Two indirect methods from the literature are shown to be effective for the optimal orbit transfer problem with relatively small numbers of burns. These methods are the Minimizing Boundary Condition Method (MBCM) and BOUNDSCO. Both of these methods make use of the first-order necessary conditions exactly as derived by optimal control theory. Perturbations due to Earth's oblateness and atmospheric drag are considered. These perturbations are of greatest interest for transfers that take place between low Earth <b>orbit</b> <b>altitudes</b> and geosynchronous <b>orbit</b> <b>altitudes.</b> Example extremal solutions including these effects and computed by the aforementioned methods are presented.
