40|$|One {{important}} need in {{the context}} of peatland restoration is to gain knowledge of soil organic matter quality and current soil-forming process in degraded peatlands. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the impact of long-term drainage on soil transformation processes. In autumn 2012, soil survey and sampling was carried out on five shallow peatlands in the Central Sudeten Mountains (Poland) which had been drained for forestry use in the late 1800 s or early 1900 s. Four <b>organic</b> <b>soils</b> (<b>Histosols)</b> and one organo-mineral soil (Histic Gleysol) were studied. The surface soil horizons were mainly transformed due to long-term forestry drainage. Increased aeration of these layers had enhanced their content of labile forms of carbon and they were undergoing secondary transformation. Soil transformation was more advanced in fen peatlands than in transitional mire or raised bogs. Only the fens exhibited characteristic evidence of the moorsh-forming process. Further drying of these soils will negatively affect their rewetting potential and significantly reduce the effective application of restoration treatments. In order to reduce organic matter transformation and loss from the investigated peatland areas, their drainage ditches should be blocked. Additionally, some trees should be removed from their central areas to reduce evapotranspiration...|$|E
40|$|The {{survival}} of Escherichia coli in <b>organic</b> <b>soils</b> (<b>Histosols)</b> was examined. The death rate of this organism in Pahokee muck {{was less than}} that observed in Pompano fine sand. The number of viable E. coli cells found in the muck was approximately threefold greater than that found in the sand following 8 days of incubation. The initial population of the coliform affected the death rate. The rate of loss of viability varied 100 -fold when the population size decreased from 2. 5 × 107 to 3. 4 × 104. Other factors affecting the viability of E. coli in muck were aerobic versus anaerobic growth of the organism and moist versus flooded conditions in the soil. The greatest {{survival of}} the coliform was noted with anaerobically grown cells amended to flooded soil. That the observed decrease in E. coli viability in soil {{was the result of}} biotic factors was demonstrated with amendment of sterile soil with E. coli. When 1. 1 × 105 bacteria per g of soil were added to sterile muck, a population of 3. 0 × 107 organisms per g of soil developed over a 10 -day period. The role of the protozoa in eradication of the coliform from the muck was indicated by a sixfold increase in the protozoan population in natural soil amended with E. coli. Higher organic matter content in a Histosol compared with a mineral soil resulted in an increased survival of the fecal coliforms. Biotic factors are instrumental in the decline in coliform populations, but the potential for growth of the coliform in the organic soil could extend the survival of the organism...|$|E

30|$|The use of LIDAR {{elevation}} {{data were}} first reported by Poulter et al. (2006) {{as a method}} to determine the severity of wildfire <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> combustion. In their study, LIDAR elevation data was used to constrain the estimates of <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> combustion {{in the absence of}} historical burn depth data for the wildfire. The authors estimated that the vertical accuracy of the LIDAR elevation data was ± 0.15 m, and the horizontal resolution was 6 m, resulting in detectable burn depths of 0.15 m to 0.30 m. The Poulter et al. (2006) study illustrates the difficulty in estimating wildfire C emissions from <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> combustion. <b>Histosol</b> <b>soils</b> present challenges to the establishment of permanent survey markers because of the deep deposits of mainly organic materials (> 12 % to 18 % C by weight) formed during the Holocene epoch, under conditions of saturation and flooding, that persist today. Stainless steel sectional rod monuments are one method to mark elevations in histosols, but the metal rods themselves introduce survey point bias through the additional heat conduction and resulting soil combustion during a wildfire. In the absence of permanent survey points within the perimeter of the Evans Road Fire, we developed a novel method and approach to estimate C wildfire emissions from <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> combustion utilizing existing pre-burn LIDAR ground point elevations (vertical accuracy ± 0.10 m to 0.15 m) and co-located post-burn field points using static survey-grade GPS equipment (horizontal and vertical accuracy ± 5 mm).

SPC comprises the superficial layers of fens (Group 1) and transitional bogs (Group 2), together with slightly acid peaty mull / strongly acid peaty moder (Group 3) and very strongly acid peaty mor (Group 4) layers overlying mineral soils. Thus, it spans <b>organic</b> <b>soils,</b> namely <b>Histosols</b> (Groups 1 and 2); together with Histic Gleysols (Group 3) and Histic Podzols (Group 4), which are developmentally intermediate between <b>organic</b> and mineral <b>soils.</b> Moderately acid eutrophic (Group 1) and very strongly acid mesotrophic (Group 2) peats (forest litter layers excluded) were uniformly characterised up to 40 cm depth; whereas for Groups 3 and 4 we examined the full thickness of available peat layers, which ranged from 10 to 30 cm. The results show that Al, K and heavy metal contents are significantly higher and organic carbon content is lower in Histic Soils (3, 4) than in Histosols (1, 2). The amounts of Ca, Mg, Mn and Fe are significantly higher and C:N ratio, exchangeable acidity and content of free H+ lower in less acidic (1, 3) than in more acidic (2, 4) soil types. The total concentration of elements (excluding heavy metals) extracted by nitro-hydrochloric acid (aqua regia) is considerably higher in less acidic soils, at 28 – 45 g kg- 1 (1, 3) versus 10 – 12 g kg- 1 (2, 4); and mean contents of individual elements decrease in the order Ca(51 %) > Fe(20 %) > S(10 %) ≥ Al(10 %) > Mg(3 %) ≥ P(3 %) > K(2 %) > Mn(1 %) > Na(< 1 %). The most abundant heavy metals are Pb (12 – 33 mg kg- 1), Zn (7 – 41 mg kg- 1), Cu (3 – 12 mg kg- 1), Cr (2 – 23 mg kg- 1) and Ni (2 – 8 mg kg- 1); Cd and Hg contents are very low, ranging from 0. 2 to 0. 5 mg kg- 1. The dominant exchangeable basic cations are Ca 2 + (78 – 93 %) and Mg 2 + (7 – 15 %), and the peat contains much smaller amounts of K+ (1 – 6 %) and Na+ (< 2 %).

50|$|In {{both the}} FAO soil {{classification}} and the USDA <b>soil</b> taxonomy, a <b>histosol</b> is a <b>soil</b> consisting primarily of organic materials. They {{are defined as}} having 40 cm or more of <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> material in the upper 80 cm. <b>Organic</b> <b>soil</b> material has an organic carbon content (by weight) of 12 to 18 percent, or more, depending on the clay content of the soil. These materials include muck (sapric soil material), mucky peat (hemic soil material), or peat (fibric soil material). Aquic conditions or artificial drainage are required. Typically, histosols have very low bulk density and are poorly drained because the organic matter holds water very well.

40|$|The {{decomposition}} and {{accumulation of}} organic materials in submerged (anaerobic) soils and sediments differ considerably {{from those in}} their aerobic counterparts. This {{is caused by the}} lack of oxygen or anaerobiosis. Compared to aerobic soils, there is preferential accumulation of organic matter in submerged rice soils. This paper reviews the current literature to establish basis or bases for organic matter accumulation in wetland soils and sediments. The decomposition or destruction of organic materials is lessened and incomplete, and the humification of organic matter is decreased under flooded conditions. Consequently, the overall organic matter decomposition rates are slower in submerged soils than those in aerobic soils and this results in net accumulation of <b>organic</b> matter in <b>soils</b> or sites that remain flooded for several years. Also, high <b>organic</b> matter <b>soils</b> or <b>Histosols</b> are developed in permanently waterlogged sites or soils because the rate of organic matter destruction is slower than its accumulation. The balance between organic matter inputs and decomposition is the primary determinant of organic matter accumulation or depletion. Several hypotheses have been postulated to explain the accumulation of organic matter in submerged soils. They include the deleterious effects on microbial activity of reduction products produced such as hydrogen sulfide or volatile fatty acids and toxic concentrations of ammonia, aluminium, iron, and other cations in soil solution. The absence of electron acceptors such as iron oxides and hydroxides in submerged soils and sediments slows down organic matter oxidation and mineralization. Formation of recalcitrant complex organic molecules with organic matter fractions, e. g., through enrichment of organic matter with phenolics in intensified irrigated rice production system, may render them less available for microbial attack and utilization. Moreover, the net primary productivity of wetlands is higher than other ecosystems. There is need for further research to fully understand the mechanism(s) involved in the accumulation of organic matter in submerged soils as wetlands offer an excellent example of conservation and maintenance of organic matter and storage of organic C...|$|R

The aim of present work is to produce a classification of the <b>organic</b> <b>soils,</b> based on measurable soil properties and to then relate the characteristic <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> properties to environmental factors. The relationship between <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> characteristics and environmental factors will enable predictive mapping of the occurrence and organic content of <b>organic</b> <b>soils</b> in Tasmania. Tasmanian <b>organic</b> <b>soils</b> were sampled across 127 sites yielding a total of 1159 soil pits. Soil and environmental characteristics were recorded for each soil pit. Unsupervised clustering of the soil characteristics from each soil pit distinguished 23 <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> groups. A classification key for identifying the 23 clusters was produced using the <b>soil</b> characteristics, <b>soil</b> <b>organic</b> carbon, humification, <b>soil</b> total nitrogen and <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> depth. Dominant environmental factors influencing the 23 clusters were found, through vector analysis, smooth plate spline contouring and multinomial log-linear modelling to be: vegetation, burn frequency, topography, geology, altitude and climate. In order to predict the location and occurrence of the soils and soil characteristics produced through unsupervised clustering, the dominant environmental factors were subsequently used to provide cluster centroids for a supervised clustering. The resulting 41 soil groups {{were found to be}} distinguishable in terms of vegetation type, geology, topography and microtopography. The supervised clusters were found to perform better than the available vegetation classifications in predicting the unsupervised clusters. <b>Organic</b> <b>soil</b> carbon, bulk density and depth were used to model <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> carbon stocks in Tasmania and provide a geographic context for the supervised and unsupervised soil clusters. Stepwise regression of <b>soil</b> <b>organic</b> carbon, showed slope as the dominant predictor across <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> producing vegetation types.

40|$|<b>Organic</b> <b>soils</b> {{are defined}} in Chapter 3 Annex 3 A. 5 of Volume 4 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and Section 5, Chapter 1, section 5 of this Wetlands Supplement. The {{guidance}} in this Chapter {{applies to all}} inland <b>organic</b> <b>soils</b> that have been drained, i. e., drainage of lands that started {{in the past and}} that still persists, or newly drained lands within the reporting period. This means that the water table level is at least temporarily below natural levels. Natural levels mean that the mean annual water table is near the soil surface but can experience seasonal fluctuations. Within each land-use category water table level is manipulated to varying degrees depending on land-use purpose, e. g., for cultivating cereals, rice, or for aquaculture, which can be reflected by different drainage classes. This Chapter deals with inland <b>organic</b> <b>soils,</b> which do not meet the definition of “coastal” defined in Chapter 4 of this Wetlands Supplement. The term “organic soils” refers to “inland organic soils” in this Chapter. This Chapter provides supplementary guidance on estimating greenhouse gas emissions and removals from drained inland <b>organic</b> <b>soils</b> in the following land-use categories as defined in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines Volume 4 : Chapter 4 (Forest Land), Chapter 5 (Cropland), Chapter 6 (Grassland), Chapter 7 (Wetlands), Chapter 8 (Settlements) and Chapter 9 (Other Land). Managed coastal <b>organic</b> <b>soils</b> are covered in Chapter 4 of this Supplement. Rewetted <b>organic</b> <b>soils</b> are considered in Chapter 3 of the Wetlands Supplement...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{with more}} than 20 % of organic content is {{classified}} as <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> in Malaysia. Contents of <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> consist {{of different types of}} organic and inorganic matter. Each type of organic matter has its own characteristic and its effect on the properties of the soil is different. Hence, a good understanding on the effect of specific organic and inorganic matter on the physico-chemical characteristic of <b>organic</b> <b>soils</b> can serve as a guide for predicting the properties of <b>organic</b> <b>soils.</b> The main objective is to unveil the effect of organic acid on the physico-chemical properties of <b>soil.</b> Artificial <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> (kaolin mixed with organic acid) was utilized in order to minimize the geochemical variability of studied <b>soil.</b> The <b>organic</b> acid which consists of humic acid and fulvic acid was extracted from highly humificated plant–based compost. The effect of organic acid on the physico-chemical properties of soil was determined by varying the concentration of organic acid. The specific gravity, Atterberg limits, pH, bulk chemical composition and the functional group of kaolin-organic acid were determined. It was found that the plasticity index, specific gravity and pH value were decreased with lowered concentration of organic acid. However, the liquid limits and plastic limits were found to be increased with the concentration decrement of organic acid. The analysis of XRF on the bulk chemical composition and analysis of FTIR spectra on the functional group of artificial <b>organic</b> <b>soils</b> with different concentration have confirmed little geochemical variability between samples...|$|R
