2500|$|Harris walked <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> {{across from}} the lower {{computer}} row, slapped the surface twice and knelt, saying [...] "Peek-a-boo" [...] to 17-year-old Cassie Bernall before shooting her once in the head, killing her instantly. Harris had been holding the shotgun with one hand {{at this point and}} the weapon hit his face in recoil, breaking his nose. Initial reports suggest that Harris asked Bernall [...] "Do you believe in God?", to which she replied yes, before getting killed. However, three students who witnessed Bernall's death, including Emily Wyant, who had been hiding beneath the table with her, have testified that Bernall did not exchange words with Harris after his initial taunt, although Wyant stated Bernall had been praying prior to her murder.|$|E

Frank, however, had other ideas. He called Blair <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> poker <b>table,</b> grabbed him by the shirt and asked Blair, [...] "Nikki, how much is one of those glasses worth?" [...] "About 5 dollars," [...] replied Blair. Sinatra then told <b>the</b> waiter <b>to</b> break every glass he could find in the kitchen.After several hundred glasses were broken, Sinatra motioned one of his bodyguards to give him (Sinatra) a thick roll of $100 bills. Frank then handed <b>the</b> roll <b>to</b> Blair and gave the now terrified restaurauteur some chilling advice: [...] "Nikki, this guy can now break as many glasses as he wants {{for the rest of his}} life. And every time I come here, I want to see that he's still working for you. Is that clear?" [...] -Anecdote on Frank Sinatra and Nicky Blair's.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{entering}} the house, Jerry sneaks past Tom and goes <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> woman's make-up <b>table,</b> where he applies face powder {{on his body}} to resemble a ghost. Putting on a record of spooky music, Jerry chases the terrified Tom outside, {{but some of the}} powder washes off as Jerry advances through the snow. Tom is furious and angrily unsheathes his claws, and he prepared to kill Jerry, but accidentally spreads the snow {{on the side of the}} building and falls back down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> alley below. Tom desperately sends Jerry another note, but Jerry responds by throwing a pair of ice skates and an ice hockey stick down to him, then happily returns to his hole and goes to sleep.|$|R
5000|$|Day moves <b>to</b> night, and <b>the</b> hotel {{restaurant}} {{is full of}} Asian men in white suits, and little people, all having dinner. One tourist who speaks English has made friends with Annie and borrowed a Wizard of Oz script, which is on his {{table in front of}} him to read while he has his dinner. At <b>the</b> next <b>table</b> sit <b>the</b> Duke and Duchess, and the dog Strudl, which is enjoying a plate of pâté de foie gras (goose liver). The assassin lurks in a corner. Otto scans the room for a clue as to which Japanese is his contact. Something startles the Duchess and a large pearl comes loose from her antique necklace and, thrown through the air, lands in the dog's food. The helpful tourist looks up from Annie's script, notices the Duchess in distress at losing her pearl, and says loudly [...] "The pearl is in the liver" ... except that, with the stereotypical Japanese phonetic error, he says not [...] "liver" [...] but [...] "river" [...] and this is clearly heard not only by the Duchess (who retrieves her pearl) but by Otto who assumes he has found his contact and, going <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tourist's <b>table,</b> slips <b>the</b> military map between the pages of the Wizard of Oz script, which is then given back to Annie.|$|R

40|$|This {{tutorial}} {{deals with}} the 2 -parameter Weibull distribution. In particular it covers the construction of confidence bounds and intervals for various parameters of interest, the Weibull scale and shape parameters, its quantiles and tail probabilities. These bounds were pioniered in Thoman, Bain, and Antle, 1969, Thoman, Bain, and Antle, 1970, Bain, 1978, and Bain and Engelhardt, 1991, where tables for their computation were given. These tables were based on simulations and show occasional irregularities. In conjunction with this tutorial we provide R code to perform various tasks (generating plots, performsimulations). It greatly simplifies the application of thesemethods <b>over</b> trying <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> available so far. Todays computing availability and speed makes this very viable. For the freely available R computing platformwe refer to R Core Team, 2015. The text identifies R code by using courier font in appropriate places...|$|R
5000|$|As Betty {{tries to}} talk to Daniel about Alexis, she gets no comment from him; all {{he wants to do}} is focus on MODE's {{upcoming}} swimwear issue. But as he begins the staff-only meeting Alexis shows up to make massive changes, by firing Daniel and placing Wilhelmina in charge of MODE as the new editor-in-chief. Daniel tells Betty that they aren't going anywhere; he has an injunction because Alexis had a sex-change, and therefore cannot take over Meade Publications since Alexander Spencer Meade is legally dead. And to make matters worse, Claire is excited to see her son-turned-daughter back, which is not sitting well with Daniel, thus prompting Betty to step in by taking Daniel's mother to a spa to calm things down and try to find out about how <b>to</b> squash <b>the</b> Meade squabble, and keep an eye on Claire in case she has a nervous breakdown. Betty gets nervous for her first time at the spa. She starts with a mud bath and then she and Claire head <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> massage <b>table.</b> On <b>the</b> massage <b>tables</b> Claire is having a relaxing facial by a dark hair haired female beautician and Betty is having a painful massage by a large masseuse who is repeatedly hitting her with tapotement bamboo sticks and bending her legs and pulling her arms back. Betty is screaming [...] "OW!" [...] and finding it too difficult to relax.|$|R
