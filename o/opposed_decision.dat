40|$|U radu se donosi kratak pregled jezikoslovne i književne djelatnosti, a detaljnije se analizira publicistička aktivnost te pedagoška i politička djelatnost zagrebačkoga kanonika Adolfa Vebera Tkalčevića (1825. – 1889.), dugogodišnjeg ravnatelja zagrebačke gimnazije i saborskog zastupnika u dva mandata. Adolfo Veber Tkalčević (1825 - 1889) clergyman in {{the diocese}} of Zagreb at his time was also a great linguist, writer, publicist, {{educator}} and politician. In this article author delivers {{a brief review of}} his linguistic and literary career and analysis in detail his political and journalistic activities. Part of his articles are marked by a moderately liberal point of view since he advocated parliamentarism, constitutional monarchy, egalitarianism of all social strata regarding the law, publicity of work within all political, administrative, juridical and religious institution, as well as promotion of civil rights and freedom. Still, regarding the relationship between Church and state, as well as regarding the relationship between sexes and concerning the social communications Tkalčević remained quite conservative. The aforementioned political and ideological orientation was quite notable also in his political activities. For two mandates Veber {{was a member of the}} Croatian parliament and he actively participated in discussions regarding the state and legal affairs, as well as concerning the organization of some educational, scientific c and cultural institutions. Moreover, he tried to view contemporary political situation in Croatia in the context of the political, cultural and economic circumstances of the entire Hapsburg Monarchy, and in that way he contributed to shaping of a realistic Croatian policy. Thus, he repeatedly suggested a certain caution regarding the negotiations with Hungarians and Austrian Germans, and his fundamental principle was preservation of autonomy and protection of territorial integrity of the Tripartite Kingdom, as well as custody of all the Croatian interests together with the interests of other Slavic nations. Therefore, Veber supported idea of reorganization of the Hapsburg Monarchy into a federation of peer nations. By the same token, he <b>opposed</b> <b>decision</b> of sending Croatian representatives to the Imperial Council in 1861, as long as this institution was not organized as elective representative body of all the nations within Monarchy and without German superiority...|$|E
30|$|Above figure {{exposes the}} network of the actors {{involved}} in Chotiari reservoir, with different relations and behaviors. The results show that those stakeholders have categorized themselves in defined strategies of construction and opposition of the reservoir (networks of pros and cons). Dramatically, the managing and administering actors (international to national scale) have a different representation on the reservoir area; they were found in alliance with the local politicians and landlords (regional scale), in order to construct the reservoir. According to the experts the cooperation of local stakeholders with administrative actors from international to national scales was based on some hidden interests of corruption and favoritism, while landlords and politicians have supported for construction reservoir. In this figure it is also disclosed that between two pro-construction networks (initiators and supporters), an administrative loyal network have {{played a key role}} to construct the reservoir. On the other hand, local actors were found in protestation against reservoir construction, relocation and compensation issues (Magsi and Torre, 2012). While, local population with the support of different NGOs have <b>opposed</b> <b>decision</b> of reservoir and manifested to protect natural resources of precious wetlands of Chotiari. Their limited scale of support led no valuable results of their oppositions, protests and agitations, because despite of this the reservoir has been constructed and inaugurated on February 2003. Results related to multilevel governance, we may say that this drama may be played to divert people’s attention that conflicts are at regional scale only. Moreover, through above figure we have explored that law enforcement institutions (courts and police) are peripheral and seem more suppressive rather to have influence on the administration, in this situation the local population will surely have no hope of their violated rights. Through this case study we acquire the information on infrastructural development settings without agreement of local stakeholders. In fact, the only way to examine the institutional inconsistencies and distribution of dissimilar power, leading to land use conflicts and loss of local population’s resources, is to analyze the dynamics of actors/stakeholders network in the study area, such as the reaction of all stakeholders during and after the project construction.|$|E
