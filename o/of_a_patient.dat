5|$|Although many {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} put forward {{to explain how the}} ketogenic diet works, it remains a mystery. Disproven hypotheses include systemic acidosis (high levels of acid in the blood), electrolyte changes and hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose). Although many biochemical changes are known to occur in the brain <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> on the ketogenic diet, it is not known which of these has an anticonvulsant effect. The lack of understanding in this area is similar to the situation with many anticonvulsant drugs.|$|E

When Linden becomes involved with a case of conjoined twins, Maddy is temporarily placed in charge of the AAU in his absence.|$|E
5|$|Methods to {{diagnose}} the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> with mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 getting cancer {{were covered by}} patents owned or controlled by Myriad Genetics. Myriad's business model of exclusively offering the diagnostic test led from Myriad being a startup in 1994 to being a publicly traded company with 1200 employees and about $500M in annual revenue in 2012; it also led to controversy over high prices and the inability to get second opinions from other diagnostic labs, which in turn led to the landmark Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics lawsuit.|$|E

5|$|Physical {{examination}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> with ankle OCD often returns {{symptoms of}} joint effusion, crepitus, and diffuse or localized tenderness. Examination often reveals symptoms of generalized joint pain, swelling, and times with {{limited range of}} motion. Some with loose body lesions may report catching, locking, or both. The possibility of microtrauma emphasizes a need for evaluation of biomechanical forces at the knee in a physical examination. As a result, the alignment and rotation of all major joints in the affected extremity is common, as are extrinsic and intrinsic abnormalities concerning the affected joint, including laxity.|$|E
5|$|Clinicians {{assess the}} {{physical}} aspects {{such as the}} appearance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient,</b> including apparent age, height, weight, and manner of dress and grooming. Colorful or bizarre clothing might suggest mania, while unkempt, dirty clothes might suggest schizophrenia or depression. If the patient appears much older than his or her chronological age this can suggest chronic poor self-care or ill-health. Clothing and accessories of a particular subculture, body modifications, or clothing not typical of the patient's gender, might give clues to personality. Observations of physical appearance might include the physical features of alcoholism or drug abuse, such as signs of malnutrition, nicotine stains, dental erosion, a rash around the mouth from inhalant abuse, or needle track marks from intravenous drug abuse. Observations can also include any odor which might suggest poor personal hygiene due to extreme self-neglect, or alcohol intoxication. Weight loss could also signify a depressive disorder, physical illness, anorexia nervosa or chronic anxiety.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, German anatomist Johann Heinrich Meckel {{recorded}} black-brown pigment granules in {{the blood}} and spleen <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> {{who had died in}} a mental hospital. Meckel was thought to have been looking at malaria parasites without realizing it; he did not mention malaria in his report. He hypothesized that the pigment was melanin. The causal relationship of pigment to the parasite was established in 1880, when French physician Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran, working in the military hospital of Constantine, Algeria, observed pigmented parasites inside the red blood cells of malaria sufferers. He witnessed the events of exflagellation and became convinced that the moving flagella were parasitic microorganisms. He noted that quinine removed the parasites from the blood. Laveran called this microscopic organism Oscillaria malariae and proposed that malaria was caused by this protozoan. This discovery remained controversial until the development of the oil immersion lens in 1884 and of superior staining methods in 1890–1891.|$|E

5|$|Starting {{with a case}} of {{shingles}} in February 1981, Bobbi Campbell {{suffered a}} succession of unusual illnesses, including leukopenia later that summer. After hiking the Pinnacles National Monument with his boyfriend in September that year, he noticed on his feet lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), then {{thought of as a}} rare cancer of elderly Jewish men but with alarming numbers of cases appearing in California and New York and now known to be closely associated with AIDS. He was formally diagnosed as having KS by dermatologist Marcus Conant on October 8, 1981. This would become Conant's first diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> with what would become known as AIDS; Campbell brought Conant a rose every year to commemorate the anniversary of his diagnosis.|$|E

40|$|The Clinical e-Science Framework (CLEF) {{demonstrator}} runs Information Extraction technology over textual, narrative patient {{notes to}} assemble repositories of clinical patient {{data for the}} purposes of biomedical research and clinical care. Since many important medical events in the course <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient’s</b> treatment are mentioned in multiple documents and most documents will only include partial descriptions of these events, constructing a coherent and complete summary <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient’s</b> history – what we call <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> chronicle- requires <b>an</b> information integration step over the output of Information Extraction. In this paper we describe and evaluate an approach to information integration which is based on mining narrative patient notes for temporal properties of medically relevant events and combining these with temporal information about events as provided by the structured (i. e., non-narrative) part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient’s</b> health record. ...|$|R
