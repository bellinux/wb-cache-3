5|$|Hyperoxic myopia has {{occurred}} in closed circuit oxygen rebreather divers with prolonged exposures. It also occurs frequently in those undergoing repeated hyperbaric oxygen therapy. This is due {{to an increase in}} the refractive power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lens,</b> since axial length and keratometry readings do not reveal a corneal or length basis for a myopic shift. It is usually reversible with time.|$|E
5|$|In a {{panoramic}} camera, the focal-plane shutter {{was replaced by}} a rotation of 180° <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> itself. This model was the basis for the Doppel-Sport Panoramic Camera, which Neubronner tried to market around 1910. It captured {{a panoramic}} view on 3cm×8cm film.

5|$|As all lens systems, natural {{vignetting}} (gradual {{reduction of}} an image's brightness {{from the center}} towards the periphery) is present due to Lambert's cosine law – this becomes more pronounced at shorter focal lengths. Wide open at 8mm, about 0.75 EVs of shading are apparent at the corners, while at 16mm only about 0.25 EV of shading is noticeable when comparing the corners to the center. For most of the focal length range <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lens,</b> there is between a half stop and third stop of corner shading. Alternatively, stopping down to higher f-numbers lessens vignetting.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, a {{researcher}} remarked that only little technical {{information is available}} about lenses, shutters and {{the speed of the}} photographic media, but reported that Neubronner obtained the film for his panoramic camera from ADOX. For this camera he estimated a film speed of ISO 25/15°–40/17° and a shutter speed of 1/60s–1/100s. The film was cut to the format 30mm×60mm and bent into a concave shape to prevent unnecessary distortion due to the half-circle movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|E
5|$|Panavision's first product—the Super Panatar {{projection}} lens—debuted in March 1954. Priced at $1,100, it {{captured the}} market. The Super Panatar was a rectangular box that {{attached to the}} existing projection lens with a special bracket. Its variable prismatic system allowed a range of film formats to be shown from the same projector with a simple adjustment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lens.</b> Panavision improved on the Super Panatar with the Ultra Panatar, a lighter design that could be screwed directly {{to the front of}} the projection lens. Panavision lenses gradually replaced CinemaScope as the leading anamorphic system for theatrical projection.|$|E
5|$|However, {{their efforts}} {{result in the}} {{destruction}} of the ship, and Reala uses the energy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lens</b> to send them through time again. They appear in an alternate timeline where the War of Heaven and Earth was won by the underground dwellers, and Barbatos and Elrane are hailed as saviors. Traveling back to the time of the War, when the initial interference was caused, they ally with Harold Belselius to return history to its proper state. While they are successful and Barbatos is felled, Elrane continues to distort history in her favor. Confronting her one last time, she is defeated, then they are confronted by Fortuna. Defeating her, the group realize {{that the only way to}} correct the distorted timeline is to destroy the Lens that forms Fortuna's life source, which will mean Reala will be erased from history. When Reala comes to terms with this and gives her blessing, Kyle destroys Fortuna's Lens, which erases all the changes wrought by her agents and returns the timeline to its original state, sending everyone back to their original times and conditions. In the corrected timeline, Kyle, now raised and trained by both Stahn and Rutee, goes on a journey to the temple where he first met Reala. While her Lens is missing, Kyle's strong will succeeds in bringing Reala back into existence and restoring his memories of her.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} how genetic programming {{was used as}} an invention machine to automatically synthesize complete designs for six optical lens systems that duplicated <b>the</b> functionality <b>of</b> previously patented <b>lens</b> systems. <b>The</b> automatic synthesis was done “from scratch”—that is, without starting from a preexisting good design and without pre-specifying <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>lenses,</b> <b>the</b> physical layout <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lenses,</b> <b>the</b> numerical parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lenses,</b> or <b>the</b> non-numerical parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lenses.</b> One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> six genetically evolved lens systems infringed a previously issued patent; three contained many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> essential features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patents, without infringing; and the others were non-infringing novel designs that duplicated (or improved upon) the performance specifications contained in <b>the</b> patents. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> six patents was issued in the 21 st-century.

5|$|The Twyman–Green {{interferometer}}, {{invented by}} Twyman and Green in 1916, is {{a variant of}} the Michelson interferometer widely used to test optical components. The basic characteristics distinguishing it from the Michelson configuration are the use of a monochromatic point light source and a collimator. It {{is interesting to note that}} Michelson (1918) criticized the Twyman-Green configuration as being unsuitable for the testing of large optical components, since the light sources available at the time had limited coherence length. Michelson pointed out that constraints on geometry forced by limited coherence length required the use of a reference mirror of equal size to the test mirror, making the Twyman-Green impractical for many purposes. Decades later, the advent of laser light sources answered Michelson's objections. (A Twyman-Green interferometer using a laser light source and unequal path length is known as a Laser Unequal Path Interferometer, or LUPI.) Fig.14 illustrates a Twyman-Green interferometer set up to test a lens. Light from a monochromatic point source is expanded by a diverging lens (not shown), then is collimated into a parallel beam. A convex spherical mirror is positioned so that its center of curvature coincides with the focus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> being tested. The emergent beam is recorded by an imaging system for analysis.|$|E
5|$|The safest way to {{view the}} Sun's disk is by {{indirect}} projection. This {{can be done by}} projecting an image of the disk onto a white piece of paper or card using a pair of binoculars (with one of the lenses covered), a telescope, or another piece of cardboard with a small hole in it (about 1mm diameter), often called a pinhole camera. The projected image of the Sun can then be safely viewed; this technique can be used to observe sunspots, as well as eclipses. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that no one looks through the projector (telescope, pinhole, etc.) directly. Viewing the Sun's disk on a video display screen (provided by a video camera or digital camera) is safe, although the camera itself may be damaged by direct exposure to the Sun. The optical viewfinders provided with some video and digital cameras are not safe. Securely mounting #14 welder's glass in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> and viewfinder protects the equipment and makes viewing possible. Professional workmanship is essential because of the dire consequences any gaps or detaching mountings will have. In the partial eclipse path, one {{will not be able to}} see the corona or nearly complete darkening of the sky, however, depending on how much of the Sun's disk is obscured, some darkening may be noticeable. If three-quarters or more of the sun is obscured, then an effect can be observed by which the daylight appears to be dim, as if the sky were overcast, yet objects still cast sharp shadows.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{for a given}} image format, {{depth of}} field is {{determined}} by three factors: the focal length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lens,</b> the f-number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> opening (the aperture), and the camera-to-subject distance.|$|E

25|$|The eyes, {{on either}} side of the head, each contain a hard lens. The image is focused by {{changing}} the position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lens,</b> as in a camera or telescope, rather than changing the shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lens,</b> as in the human eye.|$|E
25|$|Posterior {{subcapsular}} cataracts are cloudy at {{the back}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> adjacent to the capsule (or bag) in which the lens sits.

25|$|Lenses {{suffer from}} aberrations that distort images.

25|$|With {{diverging}} lenses, incoming parallel rays diverge {{after going}} through the lens, {{in such a way}} that they seem to have originated at a spot one focal length in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lens.</b> This is the lens's front focal point. Rays from an object at finite distance are associated with a virtual image that is closer to the lens than the focal point, and on the same side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> as the object. The closer the object is to the lens, the closer the virtual image is to the lens. As with mirrors, upright images produced by a single lens are virtual, while inverted images are real.|$|E
