Integration of the Multi-Agent System (MAS) with knowledge base provides a robust system for various applications, such as fault diagnosis and automated actions performing, etc. For this purpose, the present study was conducted in the field of MAS based on Gaia methodology and knowledge base. The developed MAS followed by Gaia methodology represents a generic framework that is capable to manage agents executions and message delivery. Real-time data is sampled from a power transformer and saved into a database, and it is also available to the user on request. Three types of knowledge-based systems, namely the rule-based reasoning, ontology and fuzzy ontology, were applied for the MAS. Therefore, the developed MAS is shown to be successfully applied for condition monitoring of power transformer using the real-time data. The Roger’s method was used with all of the knowledge-based systems named above, and the accuracy of the results was compared and discussed. Of the knowledge-based systems studied, fuzzy ontology is found to be the best performing one in terms of results accuracy, compared to the rule-based reasoning and ontology. The application of the developed fuzzy ontology allowed to improve the accuracy by over 22 %. Unlike the previous works in this field, that were not capable of dealing with the uncertainty situations, the present work based on fuzzy ontology has a clear advantage of successfully solving the problem with some degree of uncertainty.

40|$|Abstract — {{the most}} common fault {{diagnosis}} method of power transformer {{is based on the}} Dissolved Gas-in-oil Analysis (DGA) of transformer oil. It is a sensitive and reliable technique for the detection of incipient fault condition within <b>oil-immersed</b> <b>transformers.</b> There are a number of methods developed for analyzing these gases and interpreting their significance such as Key Gas, Roger gas ratio, Doernenburg, IEC gas ratio and Duval Triangle. Although DGA has widely been used in the industry, this conventional method fails to diagnosis in some cases.

The overall goal for the project is to develop a quantitative model for the lifetime distribution of a transformer with the final goal to implement the developed model into a maintenance planning. Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) is a widely used technique to estimate the condition of <b>oil-immersed</b> <b>transformers.</b> Incipient faults within the transformer may be detected by analyzing the gases which are dissolved in the transformer-oil.

One conclusion from this work is that the difficulty in modeling the transformers reliability lies mainly in the limited availability of adequate data. Transformer is a reliable device and since the number of failures in critical in mathematical modeling of a component´s reliability it becomes very difficult to determine such models. Another aspect is the difficulty to draw conclusions about a transformer´s condition only from the DGA results. Although there are standards available for this purpose the DGA interpretation should also be based on other information about the particular transformed such as size, construction and operation circumstance.
