We make sure there's a lot of melody in the track, so it can inspire the writer. Together with the topline writer we work, often tweek and simplify the song, and never quit before we feel we've got a killer hook.|$|E

500|$|Patrick Duffy {{returned}} to Dallas in 1986 after being absent {{for an entire}} season. The whole year's worth of episodes was written off entirely as Pam's dream. The storyline garnered the show a lot of publicity, both good and bad. The Staff of UGO Networks.com said: [...] "Soap Operas are known (and at times hated) for their ridiculously implausible storylines, and while '80s primetime suddser Dallas is still one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>favorite</b> guilty pleasures, even the great Ewing empire is not immune to the absurd storytelling techniques the genre has become associated with. While your average primetime soap operas don't usually mingle with the stuff of sci-fi and horror, there's an incredibly high rate of characters returning from the dead in the genre. Case in point: Bobby Ewing. Presumed dead after being run over by his sister-in-law, Katherine Wentworth, who also happened to be obsessed with him, fans (and CBS) had to do without Patrick Duffy, and even worse, ratings, for one whole season. Thus, Larry Hagman, who played Duffy's onscreen brother and despised oil baron J.R. Ewing, along with network execs, persuaded Duffy to return, making it possible (we're talking in soap opera terms here), for Bobby Ewing's character to come back by writing off the ratings nightmare of a season as a dream... a very bad one." ...|$|E

Gray was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award in both 1980 and 1981 in the category of [...] "Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series - Drama" [...] respectively. The character of Sue Ellen was well received by television critics. The Biography Channel said, [...] "Who could ever forget Dallas with the gin-swilling Sue Ellen Ewing, replete with shoulder pads long before Dynasty, staggering around Southfork Ranch with a permanently tearful expression as she suffered the brunt of J.R. Ewing's evil ways?" [...] The Boulevard Magazine said, It may be 2009 and seventeen years since the primetime drama Dallas went off the air, but memories of the Ewing family still linger. Corruption and betrayal, lies, greed, affairs and scandal – all were just part of another day at the Southfork Ranch. At the center of it all was one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>favorite</b> Ewings, the person we couldn't help but root for each week as she drank and slept her way through one ordeal after another. This, of course, was the tortured and (sometimes) villainous Sue Ellen Shepard Ewing, former Texas beauty queen and trophy wife of the womanizing rogue J.R. Ewing, played to perfection by actress Linda Gray.|$|E
500|$|Reviews were positive. James Poniewozik of Time {{thought that}} [...] "Because You Left" [...] {{provided}} a good balance of characterization and mythology and commended {{the character of}} Faraday, partially [...] "because a perfectly-cast Jeremy Davies has {{turned him into a}} likeable, flawed, brusque, slightly-in-over-his-head nebbish-god." [...] Matt Mitovich of TV Guide stated that the premiere [...] "offer compelling twists … the foundation is laid for a pivotal penultimate season … it sends the mind reeling and uncorks infinite possibilities." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that [...] "it's hard to name a series that is as engaging, surprising and flat-out gorgeous as Lost, or one in which every effort and penny expended seems to be put to shimmering good use. [...] This is an epic big-screen adventure done for the small screen—and done {{in a way that makes}} most big-screen versions pale in comparison." [...] Bianco also commended the characterizations, noting them as realistic and compelling. [...] Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune praised the opening sequence, calling it [...] "really, really great … nerd-tastic for [...] hardcore Lost fan; it's full of shout-outs and callbacks to classic Lost moments and trivia." [...] She concluded that the premiere is [...] "quite good" [...] (three and a half out of four stars) with [...] "a lot to like", specifically the expanded screen time for Faraday; however, Ryan expressed difficulty in understanding the use of time (travel) in the show and felt that one to two more viewings were warranted for her to give a better review of that aspect. [...] Verne Gay of Newsday summed up that [...] "The season's premiere represents pig-in-the-python storytelling—there's so much to work through, so many details, stories, characters and time dimensions to attend to, that after a while this all starts to feel like a very full meal. [...] A bloated feeling may result." [...] Among other pieces of praise, Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle was impressed by the [...] "parallel plotting" [...] of the characters on and off the island in different times. [...] Despite deeming the premiere [...] "riveting" [...] and the script [...] "tantalizing as ever", Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe had a mixed response, for he worried that he would not be able to handle a season's worth of time travel, stating that [...] "I may be alone in this, and I hope I will be proven wrong, but I expected the solution to [...] "Lost" [...] to be more metaphysical, and more original, than simply people being unstuck in time." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger deemed it [...] "really good, in terms of keeping the momentum from last season going, servicing the characters and their emotions, and providing an appropriate number of 'Whoa's per hour." [...] In a three out of four stars review, Thomas Connor of the Chicago Sun-Times stated that [...] "the time-travel training wheels are coming off—and the path thus far seems blissfully free of the usual stumbling blocks", due to the previous four seasons of [...] "baby steps" [...] that set up the science fiction driven fifth season. [...] Caryn Kunz of the Honolulu Advertiser said that [...] "This was a great episode to get back into every aspect <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>favorite</b> show: relationships, mythology, reunions/cameos, and enough whoa moments to keep me on the edge of my seat throughout." ...|$|E
