Nonetheless, it is crucial to understand overhead line technology in order to model the next generation of power networks, as most of the power <b>networks</b> still comprise <b>overhead</b> lines.

However, there are the challenges of mobility management, resource management, and <b>network</b> <b>overhead</b> management in the virtualization of the Internet.

40|$|Distribution {{networks}} {{have traditionally been}} designed for unidirectional power flow. Large scale implementation of distributed generation (DG) means that this fundamental assumption is not true any more. This causes several challenges to network design and operation. One {{of the most critical}} affected areas is system protection. The impact of DG on protection has been examined in several research papers during the last years. The most challenging issue seems to be anti-islanding protection, especially when automatic reclosing is applied. In this paper, the effect of DG on automatic reclosing is studied. After a short literature review, the method and results of simulation studies are presented. The simulations verify the existence of the problems. Protection requirements and possible solutions are discussed. Because of speed and reliability requirements, telecommunication based protection seems to be the most suitable solution, when the share of DG becomes significant.

In {{order to}} improve the non-optimal paths worked out by the ZigBee cluster-tree routing (ZTR) {{algorithm}} and to reduce the overhead of the AODVjr algorithm, we propose in this paper a low-overhead hybrid routing algorithm (LOHRA) for ZigBee networks. LOHRA effectively limits the flooding range of RREQ through utilizing the descendents of nodes and considers the length of paths and the minimum residual energy in path as routing metrics. Therefore, it not only ensures that the newly built paths are better than those of ZTR, but also reduces the redundant overhead of AODVjr and postpones {{the death of the}} nodes with low energy. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that LOHRA outperforms the classical ZTR algorithm and AODVjr algorithm in terms of network <b>overhead,</b> <b>network</b> lifetime, and the end-to-end delay of data packets...|$|E
