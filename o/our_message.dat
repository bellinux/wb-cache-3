Citing Mandela's speech in which he said, [...] "Let us use the universal language of music, to sing out <b>our</b> <b>message</b> around the world", Lennox wanted [...] "Sing" [...] to be an anthem and symbol of unity and empowerment, to help spread awareness in the world.

500|$|Musically, {{the band}} {{regarded}} the album as a 'new progression'. Bassist Nathan Cochran said that [...] "It’s not a sharp left turn; it’s a step beyond what we’ve ever done. We feel like <b>our</b> <b>message</b> and calling are the same... We’re still worship leaders; we’re {{just on a}} different scale". As a whole, Undone is a guitar-driven album with a pop rock and adult contemporary sound. The album's opening track, [...] "Where You Lead Me", builds from an acoustic guitar-driven opening into a crescendo featuring synthesizers and guitars. [...] "Here with Me" [...] has a musical vibe similar to alternative rock band Coldplay. [...] "Homesick" [...] is a ballad featuring strings from the London Symphony Orchestra.

500|$|In {{order to}} build support early in the campaign, Hunter participated in local straw polls.

The showing impressed Spartanburg Republican Gerald Emory who referred to Hunter as, [...] "a true Ronald Reagan conservative that we can support." [...] The following month he won the Anderson County, South Carolina straw poll and tied for second place in both the Greenwood County and Pickens County straw polls. Hunter thanked the counties for their support, which he claimed provided [...] "a huge boost." [...] He added, [...] "t is clear <b>our</b> <b>message</b> of maintaining a strong national defense, securing our border without amnesty, holding China accountable on trade, and protecting life are resonating with the voters. Our campaign is one of issues, not flash and expense. We don't have a jet or an army of consultants and paid staff. We do have the conservative message that is true. In the end, that will be what Americans want." ...|$|E
500|$|After the show, {{the band}} posted a public {{statement}} about the incident, thanking their fans for coming despite of the risks involved, and blessing the radicals: [...] "We are proud to call you {{our brothers and sisters}} in Christ.

In fact, <b>our</b> <b>message</b> in our shows is to love your enemy. So God bless everybody who stood outside chanting: Fuck Antestor! Hope we can talk like reasonable people someday over a fresh squeezed juice. Extra special hails to our fans who had the balls to come although they knew it could be dangerous. Antestor salutes you and be blessed." [...] In a newspaper interview with the Norwegian Christian newspaper Dagen two days following the band's safe return to Norway, bassist Erik Normann Aanonsen said that he had prepared himself for the worst-case scenario that the tour could end in death, and he reiterates the band's gratitude to the aggressive Brazilian Satanists stating: [...] "We're now twice as big in Brazil as we were before we went there." ...|$|E
