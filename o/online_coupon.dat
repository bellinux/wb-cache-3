50|$|Search engines such as Google and Yahoo! utilize {{personalized}} {{search to}} attract possible customers to products that fit their presumed desires. Based {{on a large}} amount of collected data aggregated from an individual's web clicks, search engines can use personalized search to put advertisements that may pique the interest of an individual. Utilizing personalized search can help consumers find what they want faster, as well as help match up products and services to individuals within more specialized and/or niche markets. Many of these products or services that are sold via personalized online results would struggle to sell in brick-and-mortar stores. These types of products and services are called long tail items. Using personalized search allows faster product and service discoveries for consumers, and reduces the amount of necessary advertisement money spent to reach those consumers. In addition, utilizing personalized search can help companies determine which individuals should be offered <b>online</b> <b>coupon</b> codes to their products and/or services. By tracking if an individual has perused their website, considered purchasing an item, or has previously made a purchase a company can post advertisements on other websites to reach that particular consumer in an attempt to have them make a purchase.|$|E
5000|$|In 1995, Wolfe {{founded the}} first <b>online</b> <b>coupon</b> site, known {{initially}} as CouponsDirect.com. The site {{would eventually be}} renamed MyCoupons.com. The business provided coupons for companies. In {{the first year of}} operation, MyCoupons only earned around $1,000. By 1999, however, the business was garnering over $1 million in annual sales and 20 million page views per month. The company also had around 3 million registered members. The company was sold to a competitor, Save.com, for roughly $23 million in 2000. Because this occurred {{around the time of the}} dot-com bust, Wolfe only received about $2 million total from the sale. He reacquired MyCoupons.com in 2002. After selling and reacquiring MyCoupons, Wolfe began to build Direct Response Technologies. Its flagship product was DirectTrack, an affiliate tracking technology and platform. By 2006, DirectTrack had tracked billions of impressions and tens of millions of clicks per month. Wolfe sold Direct Response Technologies and DirectTrack to Digital River in 2006. He repurchased the GiftCards.com domain and rebranded and relaunched the site in 2008. He also relaunched MyCoupons.com in 2007. Both companies became subsidiaries of Wolfe, LLC, a holding company that Wolfe founded in 2007. Other subsidiaries that are part of Wolfe, LLC include Omni Prepaid and Swapagift.com. In 2009, GiftCards.com recorded $44 million in sales. In 2011, MyCoupons was earning 2 million page views per month and maintained a network of 6,000 to 8,000 retailers across the United States. In 2013, Wolfe purchased the website Gift Card Granny and after GiftCards.com was acquired in early 2016 by Blackhawk Network Holdings, Wolfe became Gift Card Granny's CEO.

40|$|We use {{data from}} {{restaurants}} in Shanghai, China {{to conduct a}} new empirical analysis of prices and coupons. Our results show {{a positive relationship between}} prices and <b>online</b> <b>coupons.</b> Moreover, the price premium from couponing is higher for restaurants about which consumer values appear to be more uncertain. When consumer uncertainty is high, restaurants that offer coupons have an average price that is about 60 percent higher than similar restaurants that do not issue coupons. When uncertainty is low, restaurants that offer coupons have an average price that is about ten percent higher. These findings are consistent with online couponing in the restaurant industry being used for price discrimination and as a promotional device in the presence of higher uncertainty in consumer valuations. ...|$|R

As to the self-perception area, some ambivalences emerge between smartness and compulsive buying, highlighting also some dissatisfaction. The ‘social dimension’ is almost irrelevant, and as to consumer behavior, daily deal buying seems to be a kind of fashion.

40|$|ABSTRACT 	This {{dissertation}} {{was written}} {{with the objective}} of presenting the issue of sales promotions in the hospitality industry. Its' main aim is to examine customers' and hotel managers' perceptions concerning the effectiveness of sales promotions in influencing customers' purchasing intentions and compare the findings of the two groups in order to demonstrate whether managers have realised the types of special offers that attract customer attention. Birmingham and Nottingham were chosen as the targeted areas for the conduct of the surveys. 	In order to form a questionnaire with up-to-date sales promotion tools, research was conducted to discover the types of special offers hotels in these two areas are currently applying. After having examined hotels' web-pages, it was found that a variety of special offers is promoted in Birmingham and Nottingham, from contests to online price discounts, but this occurs mainly because of the existence of many hotel chains in these two areas. Independent hotels are mainly constrained to the application of monetary tools (price discounts and coupons). The findings of this online research constituted the basis for the formation of the asked questions. The target group of customers were young people aged among 18 - 35 and the target group of managers were the hotels in Birmingham and Nottingham. Customers seemed to evaluate more positively most of the sales promotion techniques than managers. Though the differences in the responses between these two groups were for many tools insignificant, the surveys revealed that there is a relative lack of knowledge of sales promotion tools from hotel owners and managers, especially from those that work in small hotels. Furthermore, it was found that customers and managers have significant different perceptions for 6 important types of special offers. The tools that were evaluated as the most effective by the customers and which should be taken into account by hotel managers for a future promotion were the online price discount, the <b>online</b> <b>coupon,</b> sampling techniques, the offering of free tickets to the destination's main attractions, the opportunity to stay longer the day of the customers' departure and general types of price discounts presented in relative or absolute terms...|$|E
40|$|The {{value of}} promotional {{marketing}} and word-of-mouth (WOM) is well recognized, but {{few studies have}} compared {{the effects of these}} two types of information in online settings.

It aims to understand the relationship between firms' promotional marketing and WOM {{in the context of a}} third party review platform. Using a three-year panel data set from one of the biggest restaurant review websites in China, the study finds that both online promotional marketing and reviews have a significant impact on product sales, which suggests promotional marketing on third party review platforms is still an effective marketing tool. This research further explores the interaction effects between WOM and promotional marketing when these two types of information coexist. The results demonstrate a substitute relationship between the WOM volume and coupon offerings, but a complementary relationship between WOM volume and keyword advertising...|$|R

Our model has a structure similar to epidemiological models.

40|$|In recent years, <b>online</b> {{discount}} <b>coupons</b> {{provided through}} deal-of-the-day websites have grownrapidly. Perceived {{as a positive}} opportunity for local merchants to promote themselves in themarket, a mutual exchange occurs as consumers are able to simultaneously benefit from promotionsand discounts on services and products. In fact, studies and research (the literature) can unite {{on the notion that}} online price promotionshave an immediate positive impact on sales. However, there is less agreement regarding repeatpurchasing effects. Promotion usage effects may exist in which repurchase rates are negativelyaffected by the fact that a promotion was used to make a purchase. In that respect, the problem wehave identified concerns the customers likeliness of returning to the local merchant after redeeminga <b>coupon</b> from the <b>online</b> discount <b>coupon</b> website. With regard to this matter, the purpose of our thesis was to describe and analyze the factors that influence the likelihood of repurchase after a transaction on an online discount website. In orderto fulfill our purpose, we conducted a quantitative study with a deductive approach on thecustomers of Groupon Stockholm. The empirical findings of our study show that price, quality and service are important factors for repurchasing, while the location of a business has an indifferent role. We further conclude that the customers appear to be loyal to the online discount websites and respectively, the benefits gained from these websites rather than the local merchants and businesses. Thus, we round up this thesis by including various managerial implications with respect to the local merchant’s perspective and strategies of improving a relational customer relationship...|$|R
