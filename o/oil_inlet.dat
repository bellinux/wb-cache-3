The injector was developed for a marine medium-speed diesel engine. The dynamic response {{from the start of the}} control signal to the end of the needle valve closing were investigated. Firstly, a complete and detailed model of the electronic fuel injector was built and integrated into an optimisation model, where a MOGA was applied.

40|$|Among the all {{parameters}} {{affecting the}} performance of a downhole de-oiling hydrocyclone, the investigation of internal flow field deserves more attempts especially in the petroleum industry. In this study, the effects of inlet flow rate, <b>inlet</b> <b>oil</b> volume fraction, and oil droplet diameter on the separation efficiency and pressure drop ratio have been investigated along the hydrocyclone body. All the simulations were performed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques, in which the Eulerian multiphase model and the Reynolds stress turbulent model were employed for the prediction of multiphase and turbulent flow parameters through the hydrocyclone. The velocity component profiles, separation efficiency, pressure drop, and volume fraction are also other parameters which have been considered in this work. The results of the simulations illustrate good agreement with the reported experimental data. Furthermore, the simulations indicate that the separation efficiency almost increases twofold, when the droplet diameter increases from 25 to 50 micron. The effect of inlet flow rate on the separation efficiency is so significant that an increase in inlet flow rate from 5 to 25 l/min causes a sharp increase in the separation efficiency and raises it 2. 5 times the initial value.

40|$|Abstract. The {{hydraulic}} elastic {{feed drive}} utilizes a hydraulic bellows tube as actuator. While pressure <b>oil</b> is <b>inlet,</b> the bellows tube will axially expand and act a pushing {{force on the}} vertical arm of the grinding frame. This pushing force will cause the deformation of the elastic arm and thus the displacement of the grinding head. To the extent of elasticity, the displacement of the deformation is linearly proportional {{to the value of}} pressure. Thus, by controlling the pressure wave form, the desired trajectory of the grinding head can be obtained. A pressure valve is used to create the pressure waves. In this paper, the dynamic characteristics, which significantly affect the position accuracy of the grinding head and thus the surface finish quality of the non-circular element are theoretically analyzed. A special experiment has been designed to test the performance of the hydraulic elastic feed drive, in which a constant force is applied to simulate the grinding force while the grinding head is keeping track of the contour of non-circular element. The experimental results demonstrate that the stiffness of the feed drive is large enough to maintain the position accuracy...|$|R

An analytical study was performed to determine the effect of various parameters on the generation rate of oil vapor from oil droplets in a hot air stream flowing in a cylindrical tube.

The experimental investigation demonstrated that fires would be ignited by a spark ignitor over the full range of air and oil flow rates and air temperatures evaluated. However, no fires could be ignited when the <b>oil</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature was maintained below 41. 7 K (290 F). The severity of the fires ignited were found to be directly proportional to the hot air flow rate. Reasonably good correlation was found between the mixture temperature in the sump at the ignitor location and the flammability limits as defined by flammability theory; thus a fairly reliable experimental method of determining flammable conditions within a sump was demonstrated.

40|$|In aeroengines {{the shafts}} are {{supported}} on bearings that carry the radial and axial loads. A ball bearing {{is made up}} of an inner-race, an outer-race and a cage which contains the balls, these together comprise the bearing elements. The bearings require oil for lubrication and cooling. The design of the bearing studied in this work is such that the oil is fed to the bearing through holes/slots in the inner race. At each axial feed location the oil is fed through a number of equispaced feedholes/slots but there is a different number of holes at each location. Once the oil has passed through the bearing it sheds outwards from both sides into compartments known as the bearing chambers. A number of studies have been carried out on the dynamics of bearings. Most of the analyses consider the contributions of fluid forces as small relative to the interaction of the bearing elements. One of the most sophisticated models for a cage-raceway analysis is {{based on the work of}} Ashmore et al. [1], where the cage-raceway is considered to be a short journal bearing divided into sectors by the oil feeds. It is further assumed that the oil exits from the holes and forms a continuous block of oil that exits outwards on both sides of the cage-raceway. In the model, the Reynolds equation is used to estimate the oil dynamics. Of interest in this current work is the behaviour of the oil and air within the space bounded by the cage and inner race. The aim is to determine whether oil feed to the bearing can be modelled as coming from a continuous slot or if the discrete entry points must be modelled. A Volume of Fluid Computational Fluid Dynamics approach is applied. A sector of a ball bearing is modelled with a fine mesh and the detailed simulations show the flow behaviour for different oil splits to the three feed locations of the bearing thus providing information useful to understanding oil shedding into the bearing chambers. The work shows that different flow behaviour is predicted by models where the <b>oil</b> <b>inlets</b> through a continuous slot compared to discrete entry holes. The form and speed of oil shedding from the bearing is found to depend strongly on shaft speed with the shedding speed being slightly higher than the cage linear speed. The break-up pattern of oil on the cage inner surface suggests smaller droplets will be shed at higher shaft speed...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{generation}} of aqueous microdrops in an oil–water flow-focusing device with integrated insulator-covered electrodes that allow for continuous tuning of the water wettability by means of electrowetting. Depending on the <b>oil</b> and water <b>inlet</b> pressures three different operating conditions were identified that shift upon applying a voltage: stable oil–water interface, drop generation, and laminar water jet formation. Full control over the drop generation is achieved within a well-defined range of inlet pressures, in quantitative agreement with a model based on the additive contributions from electrowetting and the local hydrostatic pressure at the junction. The tuning power of electrowetting is shown to increase upon device miniaturization, which makes this approach particularly attractive for flow control on the sub-micrometer scale...|$|R
50|$|On July 24, 2007, a {{crude oil}} {{pipeline}} {{owned and operated by}} Kinder Morgan Energy Partners was ruptured by an excavator digging a storm sewer trench. The rupture was a few hundred meters from the final location at the Westridge Marine Terminal. It resulted in almost 2,000 barrels of crude oil being released into the residential neighborhood and the ocean near Inlet Drive in Burnaby, British Columbia. The crude oil sprayed 11 houses on Inlet Drive and caused an evacuation of the area, forcing 250 residents from their homes. Approximately 600 barrels of the oil flowed into Burrard Inlet, the resulting cleanup costing more than $15 million. The cleanup operation ultimately recovered 1,800 barrels of <b>oil</b> from the <b>Inlet</b> and coastline.|$|R
