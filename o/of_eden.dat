5|$|Every {{configuration}} of Rule 90 has exactly four predecessors, other configurations {{that form the}} given configuration after a single step. Therefore, in contrast to many other cellular automata such as Conway's Game of Life, Rule 90 has no Garden <b>of</b> <b>Eden,</b> a configuration with no predecessors. It {{provides an example of}} a cellular automaton that is surjective (each configuration has a predecessor) but not injective (it has sets of more than one configuration with the same successor), showing that the converse of the Garden <b>of</b> <b>Eden</b> theorem is not true.|$|E
5|$|In Rule 90, on an {{infinite}} one-dimensional lattice, every configuration has exactly four predecessor configurations. This is because, in a predecessor, any two consecutive cells may have {{any combination of}} states, but once those two cells' states are chosen, {{there is only one}} consistent choice for the states of the remaining cells. Therefore, there is no Garden <b>of</b> <b>Eden</b> in Rule 90, a configuration with no predecessors. The Rule 90 configuration consisting of a single nonzero cell (with all other cells zero) has no predecessors that have finitely many nonzeros. However, this configuration is not a Garden <b>of</b> <b>Eden</b> because it does have predecessors with infinitely many nonzeros.|$|E

Moreover, Eden's great-great-grandfather Sir Robert <b>Eden,</b> 1st Baronet, <b>of</b> Maryland, was the elder brother <b>of</b> William <b>Eden,</b> 1st Baron Auckland and Morton Eden, 1st Baron Henley.|$|R

5|$|Marge {{dreams that}} she and Homer are Adam and Eve. They peacefully live in the Garden <b>of</b> <b>Eden</b> until a snake (Snake Jailbird) tempts Adam into eating dozens of apples from the {{forbidden}} tree. He persuades Eve to try one when God (Ned Flanders) witnesses his sin. Even though Adam ate many apples, God only caught Eve eating an apple, and she is therefore banished from the Garden <b>of</b> <b>Eden.</b> Adam is unwilling to come clean, but misses Eve and thinks {{of a way of}} getting her back in by digging a tunnel with the help of some of the animals. God's unicorn, named Gary, becomes exhausted from the digging and dies just before God catches Adam trying to smuggle Eve back into the Garden. The death of the unicorn enrages him further, and he expels them both from the Garden <b>of</b> <b>Eden.</b>|$|E
5|$|His {{workload}} tailed {{off in the}} mid-1980s, due {{mostly to}} his own financial success. He officially retired from the music industry in 1990, but re-emerged in 2005, producing Dishwalla's self-titled fourth album. He returned {{to work with the}} Eagles on the 2007 album Long Road Out <b>of</b> <b>Eden,</b> and followed that with the 2008 solo debut of ex-Verve Pipe singer Brian Vander Ark.|$|E

5|$|Immediately after {{completing}} The Road to Glory, Hawks began writing his next film, Fig Leaves, his first (and, until 1935, only) comedy. The film portrays {{a married couple}} by juxtaposing them in the Garden <b>of</b> <b>Eden</b> and in modern New York City. The Garden <b>of</b> <b>Eden</b> humorously depicts Adam and Eve awoken by a Flintstones-like coconut alarm clock and Adam reading the morning news on giant stone tablets. In the modern day, the biblical serpent is replaced by Eve's gossiping neighbor and Eve becomes a sexy flapper and fashion model when Adam is at work. The film starred George O'Brien as Adam and Olive Borden as Eve and received positive reviews, particularly for the art direction and costume designs. It was released in July 1926 and was Hawks's first hit as a director. Although he mainly dismissed his early work, Hawks praised this film in later interviews.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, {{an article}} in The Pall Mall Gazette popularised a {{practice}} of alternative medicine that probably began in the whaling town <b>of</b> <b>Eden,</b> Australia {{two or three years}} earlier. It was believed that climbing inside a whale carcass and remaining there for a few hours would relief symptoms of rheumatism.|$|E
5|$|Killer whales {{have helped}} humans hunting other whales. One {{well-known}} example was the killer whales <b>of</b> <b>Eden,</b> Australia, including the male known as Old Tom. Whalers more often considered them a nuisance, however, as orcas would gather to scavenge {{meat from the}} whalers' catch. Some populations, such as in Alaska's Prince William Sound, may have been reduced significantly by whalers shooting them in retaliation.|$|E

5|$|Several manga {{based on}} the games have been {{published}}. The longest-running of these, , Warriors <b>of</b> <b>Eden,</b> and Maboroshi no Daichi, were published in Monthly Sh≈çnen Gangan. Emblem of Roto, by Chiaki Kawamata and Junji Koyanagi, with art by Kamui Fujiwara, consists of twenty-one volumes published between 1991 and 1997. In 2004 Young Gangan ran a mini-series called Emblem of Roto Returns. It takes place between the timeframe of Dragon Quest III and Dragon Quest I. Warriors <b>of</b> <b>Eden</b> consists of eleven volumes, with art by Fujiwara. The series is a retelling of Dragon Quest VII with some minor changes. Maboroshi no Daichi consists of ten volumes. The series is a retelling of Dragon QuestVI with some minor changes. Other shorter manga series have been released including several based on other games, some official 4koma strips, and a manga about {{the making of the}} original Dragon Quest game.|$|E
5|$|The {{first group}} shows God {{creating}} the Heavens and the Earth.

The third group of three pictures shows the plight of Humanity {{and in particular the}} family of Noah.|$|E
5|$|The {{gatehouse}} is a two-storied, 17th century {{building with}} exposed timber and plasterwork, constructed in a distinctively local Shropshire style. It features elaborate wooden carvings {{on the exterior}} and interior doorways, including angels, the biblical characters of Adam, Eve and the serpent from the Garden <b>of</b> <b>Eden,</b> as well as dragons and other nude figures. It was designed as essentially an ornamental building, with little defensive value.|$|E

5|$|The update rule is an {{injective}} function, that is, {{there are}} no two configurations that both map to the same common configuration.
