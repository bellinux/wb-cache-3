5|$|Around 1995, the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) {{called a}} bidding {{to sell the}} property. The tender went to a Malaysian firm, the Renong Berhad and ITT-Sheraton combine over Emilio Yap, a Chinese Filipino billionaire tycoon {{and owner of the}} Manila Bulletin, the country's largest {{newspaper}} by circulation. Yap went to the Supreme Court of the Philippines and won by matching Rehong's bid and citing the Constitution's Filipino First policy in the ownership of a 'national patrimony'. Fifty one percent of the ownership was awarded to Yap's Manila Prince Hotel Corporation (MPHC), while new owners joined on April 25, 1997 as 49 percent shareholder. Yap signed a check for ₱673.2 million and the MPHC took over the property on May 7, 1997. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> Yap did was to pull down the three brass chandeliers in the lobby, upon recommendation of a feng shui expert, and replace them with five.|$|E
5|$|Gamma, {{the team}} leader and main {{combatant}} of Zombiepowder.s cast, is a 22-year-old powder hunter who desires the zombie powder {{for the sake}} of immortality, and has already obtained one Ring of the Dead at his introduction in the first chapter. Due to numerous past violent crimes, Gamma {{is one of the most}} wanted criminals in the Zombiepowder. universe, with a bounty to match. This high bounty was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> determined about Gamma's character by Tite Kubo, dating back to a pre-draft rendition of the character who was a sort of samurai. Gamma's personal history is never expounded upon, but it is implied by Balmunk that he was once a mercenary, but reformed and became a powder hunter following the death of a woman.|$|E

50|$|Allen Township was {{organized}} on June 5, 1827. The town {{was named for}} Daniel Allen, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> settlers to <b>the</b> area.

25|$|During their travels {{away from}} Halstedom, Ghat {{explains}} to Deadra through partially interactive flashbacks {{the events that}} led up to his attempt on Father-Mother's life. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> that is mentioned is that he lived for a time with the Corwid of the Free, the insane residents of the forests of Zenozoik. While he has turned away from his past life as a Corwid, his brothers and sisters still consider him as one. Ghat still harbors a sense of admiration for the single-mindedness of Corwids. Regardless, when he encounters them a fight ensues.|$|E
25|$|Some {{antivirus}} vendors maintain websites {{with free}} online scanning {{capability of the}} entire computer, critical areas only, local disks, folders or files. Periodic online scanning {{is a good idea}} for those that run antivirus applications on their computers because those applications are frequently slow to catch threats. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> that malicious software does in an attack is disable any existing antivirus software and sometimes the only way to know of an attack is by turning to an online resource that is not installed on the infected computer.|$|E

25|$|The Shinshū Honbyō, the {{mausoleum}} of Shinran, is {{now owned by}} the Ōtani-ha but is still commonly called Higashi Honganji (東本願寺) by Kyoto visitors and locals. The massive Goei-dō (also known as Mie-dō), or Founder's Hall Gate, is often <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> one sees walking north from JR Kyōto Station. Nearly identical to the Nishi Hongan-ji head temple in layout, it too features an Amida-dō, and a larger Mie-dō. The Mie-dō at Higashi Hongan-ji dates from 1895 and vies {{with a number of}} other structures for the claim of largest wooden building in the world.|$|E
25|$|During the SXSW 2007 demo, Will Wright {{said that}} the {{underwater}} phase {{was on the verge}} of being cut out. However, he has also said that, if cut, underwater civilizations would be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> to add via an expansion pack. Though the final version of Spore released to stores had indeed proven the underwater phase had been cut, it is still possible for the player's creature to swim above water. If the player swim too far into the sea, then they get eaten by a sea monster, which is probably the present-game Maxis creature, Battered Feesh.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> Tacitus {{mentions}} in {{his work}} Germania is that the Germanic people treasure their animals above all else. Tacitus also concludes that the Germanic people found cultivation repulsive. Instead, he states, the Germanic people devote themselves to food and sleep and besides that they prefer to remain idle. All of this, to certain extents, applied to Jämtland. When the people of Jämtland settled down they relied mostly on pastoralism (transhumance). Their animals were the source of wealth and they were therefore loved by their owners. This love for the livestock has manifested itself in the dialect, a male nipple is called bokkjen (the buck) and a female nipple is known as geita (the goat).|$|E

25|$|Mark Tauber, senior {{vice-president}} of HarperOne, {{has stated that}} the Green Bible was developed {{with the intention of}} being “the first ever specialty bible that takes the issues of sustainability, stewardship of the earth, what many in the religious community call ‘creation care’ very seriously”. He went further, exposing on the Green Bible’s purpose: “That the Bible has a profound message of sustainability—some might argue, the original message—is not all that surprising. What is surprising {{is that it is not}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> that comes to mind when most folks think about the Bible and its message... this Bible seeks to change that fact. We believe that the unique and specially added features by some of today's most important thinkers, writers and leaders, across the ecumenical spectrum make it a must-have for those who already find motivation, comfort and inspiration in it and for the many more who might see it freshly as a critical resource in their journey to sustain our planet”.|$|E
25|$|Salomon {{realised}} {{that his}} nephew had no talent for trade {{and it was}} decided that Heine should enter the law. So, in 1819, Heine went to the University of Bonn (then in Prussia). Political life in Germany was divided between conservatives and liberals. The conservatives, who were in power, wanted to restore things to the way they were before the French Revolution. They were against German unification because they felt a united Germany might fall victim to revolutionary ideas. Most German states were absolutist monarchies with a censored press. The opponents of the conservatives, the liberals, wanted to replace absolutism with representative, constitutional government, equality before the law and a free press. At the University of Bonn, liberal students were at war with the conservative authorities. Heine was a radical liberal and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> he did after his arrival was {{to take part in a}} parade which violated the Carlsbad Decrees, a series of measures introduced by Metternich to suppress liberal political activity.|$|E
25|$|The Orthodox Church was an {{accepted}} institution under the Ottomans, {{in contrast to}} Catholicism which was associated with enemy Austria, and actually grew in size during Ottoman rule. This included the building of churches and monasteries. Its administration continued to function though in lesser degree, no longer being the state religion. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> that Mehmet the Conqueror did was to allow the Church to elect a new patriarch, Gennadius Scholarius. The Hagia Sophia and the Parthenon, which had been Christian churches for nearly a millennium were converted into mosques, yet most other churches, both in Constantinople and elsewhere, remained in Christian hands. They were endowed with civil as well as ecclesiastical power over all Christians in Ottoman territories. Because Islamic law makes no distinction between nationality and religion, all Christians, regardless of their language or nationality, were considered a single millet, or nation. The patriarch (usually an ethnic Greek) as the highest ranking hierarch, was thus invested with civil and religious authority and made ethnarch, head of the entire Christian Orthodox population. Practically, this meant that all Orthodox Churches within Ottoman territory were {{under the control of}} Constantinople. Thus, the authority and jurisdictional frontiers of the patriarch were enormously enlarged.|$|E

500|$|Finn's {{men were}} trying to fight back by using the machine guns mounted in the PBYs, either by firing from inside the flaming planes or by {{detaching}} the guns and mounting them on improvised stands. Finn later explained that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> he did was {{to take control of}} a machine gun from his squadron's painter. [...] "I said, 'Alex, let me take that gun'... knew that I had more experience firing a machine gun than a painter." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> [...] tried after {{acquiring}} Bungie, {{after first}} attempting to fully assimilate them, {{was to move}} Bungie into a standard Microsoft building {{with the rest of}} the game group. [...] But unlike the rest of the teams they'd brought in previously, Bungie didn't move into Microsoft corporate offices – we tore all of the walls out of that section of the building and sat in a big open environment. Luckily Alex and Jason [...] were pretty steadfast at the time about staying somewhat separate and isolated.|$|E
500|$|The cast found {{working with}} the eye patches strange as they had to act with one eye; Kingston remarked that it made her [...] "slightly dizzy". Gillan was allowed to fire a specially-made machine gun used for films. Churchill's Roman Buckingham Palace was filmed in the Cardiff's City Council building. The script called for an Indiana Jones style tunnel for the Headless Monks' chamber, but as that kind of {{location}} was not available in Cardiff a set was built instead. The skulls were hand-crafted and required a lot of preparation, so it was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> started for the episode's production.|$|E

500|$|Through mid-May 2008, Kinsler had {{the best}} career stolen-base {{percentage}} (88.5%) of anyone in Rangers/Senators history with at least 40 attempts. [...] "It's part of my game", said Kinsler. [...] "It's not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> I'm known for." [...] According to scouts, his ability on the basepaths is due to innate instincts and his [...] "twitch speed" [...] rather than his pure running speed. Grouse, who signed him, says that Kinsler also [...] "goes from first to third faster than anyone, because he has that God-given ability to read the ball so well off the bat." ...|$|E
500|$|A lot of {{the special}} was more [...] "edgy" [...] and dark than {{what had been done}} {{previously}} on Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends. A major reason behind this was the peril, danger, and conflict that constructed the plot so heavily. McCracken explains, [...] "When we start a show <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> we think about is tone, is this a goofy one, is it a serious one, whatever it may be we stay true to that tone. This one had some higher stakes so we let it naturally unfold that way. This was the first show/special on Cartoon Network to receive a TV-PG rating." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2011 Veronica Henry {{reviewed}} Epiphany 2.32, saying [...] "To be fair, {{this would}} be a hard sell as a primary desktop browser for most users. In fact, there isn't even a setting to let you designate it as your default browser. But for those instance where you need to fire up a lighting-fast browser for quick surfing, Epiphany will do the trick." [...] She further noted, [...] "Though I still use Firefox as my primary browser, lately it seems to run at a snail's pace. So, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> I noticed about Epiphany is how quickly it launches. And subsequent page loads on my system are equally as fast." [...] Henry criticized Epiphany for its short list of extensions, singling out the lack of Firebug as a deficiency. Web instead supports Web Inspector offered by the WebKit engine, which has similar functionality.|$|E
