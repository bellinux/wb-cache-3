50|$|Kohn, Kohn & Colapinto gained {{nationwide}} attention representing whistleblower Linda Tripp regarding her revelations <b>of</b> <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky's</b> {{involvement in}} the sex scandal that brought about the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. The revelations that Lewinsky and Clinton had lied in their legal filings in the sexual harassment case brought against the sitting president by Paula Jones, and that Lewinsky had tried to suborn perjury from Tripp, who knew about her affair with Clinton, {{was one of the}} main factors influencing the articles of impeachment voted by the House of Representatives.|$|R

25|$|During President Bill Clinton's 1999 {{impeachment}} {{trial in the}} Senate, Edwards {{was responsible for the}} deposition <b>of</b> witnesses <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> and fellow Democrat Vernon Jordan, Jr. During the 2000 presidential campaign, Edwards was on Democratic nominee Al Gore's vice presidential nominee short list (along with John Kerry and Joe Lieberman, Gore's eventual pick).|$|R
50|$|In 2011, WND Books {{published}} his second memoir, Catching Our Flag: Behind the Scenes of a Presidential Impeachment. During the Clinton impeachment {{saga of the}} 1990s, as the media force-fed America and the world a steady diet <b>of</b> <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky's</b> blue dress, a wagging presidential finger, and parsing phrases like the meaning of 'is,' Rogan knew if the scandal ever led to impeachment proceedings, future accounts would suffer from faulty memories or faulty motives. To combat the threat of factual or historical error, Rogan kept copious notes during every significant meeting relating to impeachment from his {{first day on the}} Committee. He did this so there would be a complete and accurate historical chronicle - - the best evidence - - of what really happened behind the scenes in the unfolding drama.|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{mentioned}} in the Starr Report, the late-1990s account of Independent Counsel Ken Starr's investigation <b>of</b> the <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> scandal. [...] After {{a visit to the}} White House in November 1997, Lewinsky wrote that she [...] "noticed you (President Clinton) had the new SarahMcLachlan CD" [...] and that [...] "whenever I listen to song #5 (Do What You Have to Do) I think of you.". McLachlan's representatives had no comment on the matter.|$|R
5000|$|The Private Lives of the Three Tenors is a gossip {{biography}} of tenors Plácido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti, and José Carreras by Marcia Lewis, the mother <b>of</b> <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky.</b> The book received high-level publicity during the 1998 Lewinsky scandal, as journalists compared Lewis' [...] "hints" [...] of {{an affair with}} popular opera singer, Plácido Domingo, to Lewinsky’s then-unproven allegations against U.S. President Bill Clinton. Domingo insisted that he only knew Lewis socially.|$|E
5000|$|On March 3, 1999, her {{interview}} <b>of</b> <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> {{was seen by}} a record 74 million viewers, the highest rating ever for a news program. [...] Walters asked Lewinsky, [...] "What will you tell your children when you have them?"

5000|$|In March 1998, Bacon {{released}} {{details of}} employee Linda Tripp's personnel file to a reporter, disclosing that Tripp had omitted on her employment application {{an incident that}} occurred when she was arrested for theft when she was 19 years old. Tripp, a Defense Department employee, had been a friend <b>of</b> <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky,</b> who had herself worked as an assistant in Bacon's office in 1996 and 1997 (having been hired {{on the recommendation of}} the White House). Bacon was criticized for violating privacy laws and harming Tripp's reputation. In response to a Defense Department Inspector General's report in 2000 that concluded that Bacon had not followed authorized procedures, William Cohen published a letter that had been sent to Bacon in which Bacon's actions were called [...] "hasty and ill-conceived". Bacon issued a statement that the information he released was driven by [...] "a desire to be responsive to an urgent media inquiry" [...] and that the Inspector General's two-year investigation did not find any connection to the White House. In a 2003 settlement, following a lawsuit which claimed that the revelations violated the Privacy Act of 1974, Tripp received a payment of $595,000, retroactive promotion and salary increases for the years 1998 to 2000 and the right to reapply for government employment.|$|E
5000|$|Both major-party {{candidates}} {{engaged in}} negative campaign tactics, with Bowles' campaign attacking Burr for special interest donations and his positions on trade legislation, and Burr's campaign attacking Bowles for his {{connections to the}} Clinton administration. Both attacks had basis in reality: Burr's campaign raised funds from numerous political action committees and at least 72 of the 100 largest Fortune 500 companies, while Bowles departed from the Clinton administration in the midst <b>of</b> the <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> scandal.|$|R
5000|$|The book is {{considered}} a satire <b>of</b> the <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> scandal which consumed much of Bill Clinton's second term as president, with legal antics, massive media coverage and spin control. Like Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth MacMann met her husband, the future president, at law school. MacMann is criticized for being overly ambitious and her husband's affairs became a source of embarrassment. Buckley's real target, however, is media coverage of such events [...] - [...] "O. J. and the Clinton scandals rolled into one." ...|$|R

5000|$|A much-quoted {{statement}} from Clinton's {{grand jury testimony}} showed him questioning the precise {{use of the word}} [...] "is". Contending that his statement that [...] "there's nothing going on between us" [...] had been truthful because he had no ongoing relationship with Lewinsky {{at the time he was}} questioned, Clinton said, [...] "It depends upon what the meaning of the word 'is' is. If the—if he—if 'is' means is and never has been, that is not—that is one thing. If it means there is none, that was a completely true statement". Starr obtained further evidence of inappropriate behavior by seizing the computer hard drive and email records <b>of</b> <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky.</b> Based on the president's conflicting testimony, Starr concluded that Clinton had committed perjury. Starr submitted his findings to Congress in a lengthy document (the so-called Starr Report), and simultaneously posted the report on the internet, replete with lurid descriptions of encounters between Clinton and Lewinsky. Starr was criticized by Democrats for spending $70 million on an investigation that substantiated only perjury and obstruction of justice. Critics of Starr also contend that his investigation was highly politicized because it regularly leaked tidbits of information to the press in violation of legal ethics, and because his report included lengthy descriptions which were humiliating yet irrelevant to the legal case.|$|E
40|$|Thursday, February 19, 1998 WRITER: Kathy R. Pharr, (706) 542 - 5172 CONTACT: Ronald L. Carlson, (706) 542 - 5186 LEWINSKY 2 ̆ 7 S MOM 2 ̆ 7 S TESTIMONY IS 2 ̆ 7 MANNA FROM HEAVEN 2 ̆ 7 FOR SPECIAL PROSECUTOR, SAYS UGA LAW PROFESSOR ATHENS, Ga. [...] The {{testimony}} <b>of</b> <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> 2 ̆ 7 s mother Marcia Lewis, who {{was granted}} a reprieve today from further grand jury testimony due to emotional duress, is like 2 ̆ 2 manna from heaven 2 ̆ 2 for Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr, says Professor Ron Carlson, a criminal law expert at the University of Georgia. Starr 2 ̆ 7 s strategy is obvious, says Carlson: drill the mother on all the important points {{of the case and}} have a loaded gun trained on Lewinsky. 2 ̆ 2 And it will all be set when Monica comes before that grand jury, 2 ̆ 2 said Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 She will have virtually no wiggle room. To have the mother come in before the key witness to lay this kind of groundwork, it will form for Starr a superb template on which to then proceed with the Monica Lewinsky interrogation. 2 ̆ 2 Carlson expects Lewinsky to appear before the grand jury next week, and he predicts that she will be granted use immunity [...] not a free pass from ever being prosecuted, but protection from criminal charges stemming from her grand jury testimony. Carlson says the success of Starr 2 ̆ 7 s case hinges on the talking points memo, 2 ̆ 2 the most important single piece of evidence in the case so far. 2 ̆ 2 However, current secret service agents should not be coerced to testify against the president, says Carlson. He believes executive privilege should be invoked to protect him. 2 ̆ 2 It 2 ̆ 7 s very unwise policy to dragoon secret service agents before tribunals such as grand juries, 2 ̆ 2 said Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 They are sworn to protect the president. These kinds of efforts compromise, it seems to me, that duty to a certain extent in the sense that requiring them to go to court or to grand juries and to reveal disclosures they overheard because of their private position with the president will cause the president to avoid having secret service around all the time, particularly when he 2 ̆ 7 s looking at having very confidential discussions with foreign leaders. 2 ̆ 2 Carlson, a nationally recognized expert in evidence, trial practice and criminal procedure, has litigated many cases and has been admitted to practice before the United States Supreme Court. He has written numerous books on trial techniques and provided extensive commentary for the national media in high-profile trials. - 30...|$|E
50|$|In 1998, Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives for perjury {{before a}} grand jury and {{obstruction}} of justice during a lawsuit against him, both related to a scandal involving White House (and later Department <b>of</b> Defense) employee <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky.</b> Clinton was acquitted by the U.S. Senate in 1999 and served his complete term of office.|$|R

50|$|Some criticised the NATO {{intervention}} as {{a political}} diversionary tactic, coming as it did on the heels <b>of</b> the <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> scandal, pointing {{to the fact that}} coverage of the bombing directly replaced coverage of the scandal in American news cycles.

40|$|The paper {{provides}} a discursive analysis of notions of emotionality in women and examines {{the ways in}} which women who have been portrayed as emotional construct themselves and their actions. It focuses on Diana, Princess <b>of</b> Wales and <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky.</b> The content <b>of</b> television interviews with them is examined to determine how they use notions of emotionality in their discourse in order to account for their actions. Diana allocates blame by accusing the media and royal family of applying the label ‘emotional’ to her. She constructs them as being threatened by her strength of character. In contrast, <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> embraces the label ‘emotional’, using her emotional nature to excuse her actions and to blame others for her circumstances...|$|R
50|$|His novel, Bitsy Nickle Might Have AIDS, {{published}} in 1991, captures {{a moment of}} collision between leftover Southern Victorian morality and the post-modern sexual revolution. The book predates and strangely foretells <b>of</b> the <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> affair. Bitsy Nickle is rife with political satire and black comedy relevant to heterosexual transmission of HIV {{in the early years}} of the AIDS epidemic. The book was instantly controversial. Bryan was invited to speak at college campuses and private school auditoriums in the Bible Belt. While admonishing young people to protect themselves sexually, he challenged local politicians to set a good example by being publicly tested for AIDS; often elected officials invited him to leave town. Bitsy Nickle Might Have AIDS was optioned for film.|$|R
500|$|After the 1998 elections, the House impeached Clinton, alleging {{perjury and}} {{obstruction}} of justice related to the Lewinsky scandal.

40|$|Much of the {{literature}} {{in the field of}} Political Science is concerned with explaining voting behavior by legislators. The central research question in this study is what causes changes in voting behavior by members of the United States House of Representatives with regard to social welfare bills? This research focuses on determining which variables sometimes supercede ideology in the decision making process of members of Congress and at what times they intervene. Thus the main hypothesis is: When factors other than personal ideology become more important to the legislator, they will override ideology as the determinant of the vote. The factors that are expected to influence voting behavior besides ideology include: presidential influence; the condition of the economy; the presence of the Iran-Contra Scandal; the presence <b>of</b> the <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> Scandal; and the presence of Newt Gingrich as Speaker of the House. The influence of these factors is measured over a time span of 30 years.
