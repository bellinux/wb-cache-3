5|$|On September 20, a {{tropical}} cyclone was observed south off Guam, which proceeded northward through the Northern Marianas Islands. It {{turned to the}} northwest, but curved to the northeast by September 22. Passing south of Japan, the storm was last observed two days later. Another storm was <b>observed</b> <b>on</b> September 23 {{to the south of}} the Ryukyu Islands. It moved to the northeast at first before executing a loop in its track, passing through the Ryukyu Islands. The storm progressed to the northeast, remaining south of Japan, and was last noted on September 29. The final storm of the month was first <b>observed</b> <b>on</b> September 29 near Guam. Moving generally to the northwest at first, it turned to the northeast on September 30 and was last observed two days later to the southeast of Japan. While near the Bonin Islands, a station recorded a minimum pressure of 989 mbar (29.23 inHg).|$|E
