5|$|A Baptist {{church was}} built, also <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>road,</b> and opened in 1923. It was a timber-framed {{weatherboard}} building, built on land {{donated by the}} first Baptist minister's son, the local butcher. The last service at the church was held 28 April 1985. Prior to this, as attendance declined, the congregations of the Baptist and Uniting Churches had often combined, and roles such as the organist were shared.|$|E
5|$|At Kruger's {{suggestion}} Joubert {{was elected}} Commandant-General of the restored republic, {{though he had}} little military experience and protested he was not suited to the position. The provisional government set up a temporary capital at Heidelberg, a strategically placed town <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>road</b> from Natal, and sent {{a copy of the}} proclamation to Lanyon along with a written demand that he surrender the government offices in Pretoria.

5|$|Hagley's {{recreation}} ground opened <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>road</b> in 1902; {{until then}} local paddocks were used. An Australian rules football club {{was formed in}} Hagley c.1895. Matches were played on a private paddock until 1902 when they moved to the recreation ground. The club's most successful period was, {{as part of the}} Esk Association, when they won five successive premierships from 1949–53. The club closed in 1998, as part of a general decline of country football in Tasmania. During the club's 102 years, the most widely known player was former St Kilda player Matthew Young.|$|E

5|$|The {{area has}} been {{inhabited}} since the Stone Age, and was a centre of ironworking in Roman times. Crawley developed slowly as a market town from the 13th century, serving the surrounding villages in the Weald. Its location <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>road</b> from London to Brighton brought passing trade, which encouraged the development of coaching inns. A rail link to London opened in 1841.|$|E
5|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>road,</b> the 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry, held a {{blocking}} position northwest of Hamch'ang, {{supported by a}} platoon of tanks from A Company, 78th Tank Battalion, and A Battery, 90th Field Artillery Battalion. The 1st Battalion was emplaced with the 2nd Battalion but stayed less than 24 hours before it was sent to reinforce the US 27th Infantry Regiment on the next north-south line of communications westward. Thus, in effect, one battalion of US troops stood behind ROK units on the Hamch'ang approach. On the second road, that leading into Sangju from the west, the 24th Infantry Regiment assembled two, and later all three, of its battalions.|$|E
5|$|Telephone {{services}} reached Whitemore in 1918, initially {{with only}} three subscribers. Telephone switching was done at the post office. Whitemore {{was connected to the}} State's electricity system in 1929. The electricity was fed from the Hydro-Electric scheme and was connected to twelve buildings, in Whitemore and several nearby farms, by August of the same year. There may have been blacksmiths in Whitemore from the mid-19th century. A blacksmith established a shop <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>road</b> in 1895 that was, by 1900, the only blacksmith in the area. Shaw Contracting's office is on the site of this former blacksmith's shop.|$|E

5|$|The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade {{advanced}} {{across the}} river and established two bridgeheads. The first was across the bridge <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>road</b> near Khirbet Hadrah (also referred to as Khurbet Hadra) and the second was at Sheik Muanis, {{near the mouth of}} the river. These operations had two aims– to gain territory and discourage the Ottoman Eighth Army from transferring troops into the Judean Hills to reinforce the Seventh Army. After successful actions by the New Zealand Mounted Brigade, two infantry battalions of the 54th (East Anglian) Division held these two bridgeheads on the northern bank until they were attacked by overwhelming forces on 25 November. The 3rd and 7th Divisions of the Ottoman Eighth Army had driven in the bridgeheads and restored the tactical situation.|$|E
5|$|The asylum was {{established}} by Edward Long Fox and considered {{state of the art}} when it opened in 1806, having been built on moral treatment ideas pioneered at the York Retreat, which had opened in 1796. Fox had an extensive private practice in Bristol and served as a physician at Bristol Infirmary before taking over a madhouse at Cleeve Hill in 1792. He had a range of different businesses locally and was able to pay £4,000 for the Brislington Estate. The site had previously been Brislington Common, which had been enclosed in 1780. The site, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>road</b> between Bristol and Bath, now the A4, enabled him to attract wealthy clients from both cities.|$|E
5|$|The {{town has}} some 19th-century {{buildings}} listed {{on both the}} Register of the National Estate and the Tasmanian Heritage Register. Hagley Mill is noted as possibly the only extant mill in Australia that was horse-driven. Quamby Estate, the former estate of Sir Richard Dry, is run as a tourist attraction and has a 9-hole golf course. Hagley's reticulated water supply is sourced from a filtration and treatment plant at nearby Westbury. This plant opened in 2013; from 1902 until then the town had received untreated water. From 1871 the town was serviced by passenger rail, but this ceased prior to 1978. Hagley was originally <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>road</b> from Launceston to Deloraine, but was bypassed in 2001 when the Hagley section of the Bass Highway was completed.|$|E

5|$|A {{government}} school {{was established in}} the 1870s and grew to 65 students by 1901. Mond's business expanded throughout {{the latter part of the}} 19th century and the prosperity of the town did likewise. He built a large grain store opposite the mill and opened offices and a depot in Launceston. Westbury Municipal Council built a public hall <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>road</b> in 1883. The current weatherboard town hall dates from c1900 and the old hall is presumed to have been destroyed prior to this. At the town's height in the 19th century, just after the return of men from the Victorian gold fields, the town had four public houses and a population of approximately 400. It had four public houses operating two of which, Prince of Wales and the Carrick Hotel, remained open in 1901. As of 1883 it was reported that the inns were kept open by the Carrick Races and fortnightly livestock sales. Carrick's livestock sales were held at the Carrick Hotel and were the main fat stock sales for Launceston. At the turn of the century the town had no reticulated water. It relied on wells, rainwater and the inconstant river.|$|E
5|$|Deep and fast-flowing, the el Auja river {{could not}} be crossed except at known and {{well-established}} places, so at 01:00 on 24 November the Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment crossed at the ford on the beach. They moved at a gallop and quickly seized the hills which overlooked the ford, capturing the village of Sheikh Muannis (which gave {{its name to the}} ford), but the Ottoman cavalry garrison escaped. The Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment came up to the Canterbury Regiment and then advanced eastwards to Khurbet Hadrah, which commanded the bridge <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>road.</b> They captured 29 prisoners, one machine gun, and one British Lewis gun. Two infantry companies of the Essex Regiment, 161st (Essex) Brigade, 54th (East Anglian) Division crossed the Hadrah bridge and occupied the village. The 4th and 11th Squadrons of the Auckland Mounted Rifle Regiment with the 2nd Squadron of the Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment, were placed at the bridge and in the village of Sheikh Muannis in front of the infantry posts. The Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment's 1st Squadron took up a post on the sea beach; each of these squadrons had two machine guns to strengthen them.|$|E
5|$|Organised {{water supply}} in the town began at least by 1883 when it was {{reported}} being carted from the millrace. The river's water was used as wells in the town were deemed too brackish. Five years later Thomas Monds installed hydraulic rams and began pumping water from the river to three iron tanks in the town. He on-sold the water to townspeople, though the mill had priority over river water; this was a particular problem during droughts when the Liffey slowed to a trickle. Westbury Council—local government of the time—called for tenders for Carrick's water supply in 1889. This water supply system was completed in 1890. Water was again pumped from the river near the mill, again by hydraulic rams, to a tank near {{the centre of the}} town which supplied another tank <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>road</b> and some houses on the same road. Both tanks had troughs and hoses for public use.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{accession}} William Rufus gave the town, with the lands adjacent, to the see of Durham, and, under the patronage {{of the bishops}} of that diocese, it grew in importance, and became an episcopal residence. In 1130 a castle {{was built on the}} west side of the town adjacent to North Beck by Bishop Rufus and was expanded in 1142 after William Cumin seized the Bishopric of Durham in 1141. The castle was further expanded in 1173 by Hugh Pudsey and garrisoned by a group of Flemish soldiers, an act which enraged King Henry II who ordered that it be razed to the ground in 1177. A more substantial fortified palace surrounded by a moat was built on the same site in 1199 replacing the traditional motte-and-bailey castle. The palace became an important administrative centre for the bishops' lands in Yorkshire and served as a major residence for the bishops and their staff. The palace lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>road</b> from York to Durham and was a regular stopping place for royalty and other dignitaries. The palace fell into ruin by 1658 and the site is now a cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The LRDG {{was formed}} {{specifically}} {{to carry out}} deep penetration, covert reconnaissance patrols and intelligence missions from behind Italian lines, although they sometimes engaged in combat operations. Because the LRDG were experts in desert navigation, they were sometimes assigned to guide other units, including the Special Air Service and secret agents across the desert. During the Desert Campaign between December 1940 and April 1943, the vehicles of the LRDG operated constantly behind the Axis lines, missing a total of only 15 days during the entire period. Possibly their most notable offensive action was during Operation Caravan, {{an attack on the}} town of Barce and its associated airfield, on the night of 13 September 1942. However, their most vital role was the 'Road Watch', during which they clandestinely monitored traffic <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>road</b> from Tripoli to Benghazi, transmitting the intelligence to British Army Headquarters.|$|E
5|$|The {{lands to}} the east of the City had always been used as hunting grounds for bishops and royalty, with King John {{establishing}} a palace at Bow. The Cistercian Stratford Langthorne Abbey became the court of Henry III in 1267 for the visitation of the Papal legates, and it was here that he made peace with the barons {{under the terms of the}} Dictum of Kenilworth. It became the fifth largest Abbey in the country, visited by monarchs and providing a popular retreat (and final resting place) for the nobility. The Palace of Placentia at Greenwich, to the south of the river, was built by the Regent to Henry V, Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester and Henry VIII established a hunting lodge at Bromley Hall. These Royal connections continued until after the Interregnum when the Court established itself in the Palace of Whitehall and the offices of politics congregated around them. The East End also lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>road</b> to Barking Abbey, important as a religious centre since Norman times and where William the Conqueror had first established his English court.|$|E
