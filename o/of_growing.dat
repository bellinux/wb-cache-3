This research was conducted at experimental field of Agriculture Faculty, University of North Sumatera, Medan, in april until august 2015, using randomized block design with two factors, i. e storage period (0, 5, 10, 15, 20 days) and diameter of stump (1. 6 - 2. 0 cm, 2. 1 - 2. 5 cm, 2. 6 - 3. 0 cm). Parameters observed were percentage <b>of</b> <b>grow,</b> time <b>of</b> break bud, height of bud, diameter of bud, amount of leaf, total leaf area, root length, root dried weight and shoot dried weight. The result showed that the storage period significantly affected on percentage <b>of</b> <b>grow,</b> diameter <b>of</b> bud, amount of leaf, total leaf area and root length. While the treatment diameter of stump significantly affected on percentage <b>of</b> <b>grow</b> and root length.

5|$|Another popular method <b>of</b> <b>growing</b> {{synthetic}} diamond is {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD). The growth occurs under {{low pressure}} (below atmospheric pressure). It involves feeding a mixture of gases (typically 1 to 99 methane to hydrogen) into a chamber and splitting them to chemically active radicals in a plasma ignited by microwaves, hot filament, arc discharge, welding torch or laser. This method is mostly used for coatings, but can also produce single crystals several millimeters in size (see picture).|$|E
5|$|Brominated {{flame retardants}} {{represent}} a commodity <b>of</b> <b>growing</b> importance, {{and make up}} the largest commercial use of bromine. When the brominated material burns, the flame retardant produces hydrobromic acid which interferes in the radical chain reaction of the oxidation reaction of the fire. The mechanism is that the highly reactive hydrogen radicals, oxygen radicals, and hydroxy radicals react with hydrobromic acid to form less reactive bromine radicals (i.e., free bromine atoms). Bromine atoms may also react directly with other radicals to help terminate the free radical chain-reactions that characterise combustion.|$|E
