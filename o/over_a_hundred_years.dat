5|$|After {{his army}} crossed the Euphrates, {{following}} a route opened up by Lucullus <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> before, he received envoys from Tiridates and Vologases. At {{the approach of}} such a large force, and aware of Corbulo's ability as a general, the two Arsacids were anxious to negotiate. Indeed, Corbulo, no doubt on instructions from Nero, reiterated the old Roman position: if Tiridates would accept his crown from Rome, then renewed war could be averted. Tiridates readily agreed to negotiations, and Rhandeia, the scene of last year's Roman defeat, was agreed upon as a meeting place. To the Armenians, this place {{was intended as a}} reminder of their strength, while Corbulo agreed to it because there he hoped to expunge the earlier disgrace, by peace or war. Once there, Corbulo put Paetus' son, who served under him as a legate, in charge of a party that was to gather the remains of the Roman soldiers and ensure them a proper burial. On the agreed day, both Tiridates and Corbulo, each accompanied by 20 horsemen, met between the two camps. Tiridates agreed to travel to Rome and seek confirmation of his crown from Nero. In sign of this agreement, a few days later, both armies put on a display, arrayed in full parade gear. Tiridates approached the Roman camp, where a statue of the Emperor Nero had been erected upon a raised platform, and placed his royal diadem at its feet in submission.|$|E

It also considers the evolution of volunteering since the late nineteenth century through study of students' activities and argues that the universities made significant contributions to causes and campaigns ranging from educational reconstruction in 1920 s Europe, relief for victims of fascism in the 1930 s and international development in the 1960 s. The book draws on rich historical sources and a wider range of student testimony than any earlier study to tell the fascinating story of how ordinary women and men students engaged with the pressing social and international problems of the twentieth-century...|$|R

As the continuum of the above selection of dimensions, gender ideology of Javanese priyayi which reflects senior junior partnership is made available as the stock of knowledge for its identity, not only governs the micro-context of family relation but more obviously operates as the backbone structure of the organization. The endurance of such a structure is laid by the background of its founders who were mainly the elites of the Javanese santri-priyayi in its inception era and politically sustained by the macro-structure of the Indonesian state which has been primarily dominated by the Javanese priyayi. This reciprocal influence is made possible for such a gender regime to operate within this organization <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>year</b> existence with the legitimacy of religious teachings which is arbitrarily a selective mechanism of normative ground...|$|R

30|$|Carbon dioxide (CO 2) and {{nitrous oxide}} (N 2 O) {{are two of}} the most {{important}} greenhouse gases (GHGs) that contribute to global warming (IPCC 2007). Nitrous oxide also contributes to stratospheric ozone layer depletion (Ravishankara et al. 2009).

The concentration of CO 2 has also increased from 280  ppm in pre-industrial times to 392  ppm in the early 21 st century (Tans 2012), highlighting that a reduction in the concentration of both gases would aid in the mitigation of climate change.|$|R
40|$|This paper explores an {{addition}} to theory in urban geography pertaining to spatio-temporal dynamics. Remotely sensed data on the historical extent of urban areas were used in a spatial metrics analysis of geographical form of towns and cities in the Central Valley of California (USA). Regularities in the spatio-temporal {{pattern of urban growth}} were detected and characterized <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>year</b> period. To test hypotheses about variation over geographical scale, multiple spatial extents were used in examining a set of spatial metric values including an index of contagion, the mean nearest neighbor distance, urban patch density and edge density. Through changes in these values a general temporal oscillation between phases of diffusion and coalescence in urban growth was revealed. Analysis of historical datasets revealed preliminary evidence supporting {{an addition}} to the theory of urban growth dynamics, one alluded to in some previous research, but not well developed. The empirical results and findings provide a lead for future research into the dynamics of urban growth and further development of existing urban theory. 1...|$|R
