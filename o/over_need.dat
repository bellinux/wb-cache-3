40|$|Aesthetic, function, {{and fashion}} {{consumer}} values are investigated {{in relationship to}} other values and demographic variables. Findings suggest that fashion oriented consumers tend to value quantity over quality, buy from "want " rather than "need, " value disposability over recycling, or not return garments to a store and complain when dissatisfied. Consumers that value functionality {{are also more likely}} to value cost over convenience, need over want, and recycling over disposability.

With the exception of household income, differences based on demographic variables were notfound. It was concluded that results from the study could assist apparel marketers in product planning.

In light of these statistics, policy makers have struggled to develop paradigms to increase kidney availability through the harvesting of cadaver kidneys. In David Steinberg’s “Opt-In System, ” (2004), individuals must agree to allow researchers to harvest their kidneys after they have died {{in order to be}} assured access to kidney transplants in life. Here, I argue that the Opt-In model (i) inappropriately privileges merit <b>over</b> <b>need</b> for medical resource allocation decisions, and (ii) needlessly privileges like-reciprocation in the construction of a system that forces a comparison of two incomparable rights. The use of this merit-based resource distribution paradigm presents individuals with a contract that effectively coerces them into unfairly sacrificing one right for the sake of another.

During the last century, basic formal education has become an ideal the world over. According to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, higher proportions of people than ever before are completing primary, secondary, or postsecondary education (Cohen, Bloom, & Malin, 2007). Schools across the world—whether in Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, or Oceania—tend to share some basic features: They are designed to prepare children and youth to become engaged citizens, ethical human beings, and productive workers who will contribute to the societies in which they live. But for the most part, schools today are out of sync with the realities of a global world. Psychologist Howard Gardner (2004) points out the new tension between the glacial pace of institutional change in schools and the forces of globalization. Because of globalization—the ongoing process of intensifying economic, social, and cultural exchanges across the planet—young people the world <b>over</b> <b>need</b> more innovative thinking skills, cultural awareness, higher-order cognitive skills, and sophisticated communication and collaboration skills than ever before.

40|$|The “first {{generation}} ” {{of research}} {{studies on the}} prediction of violent behavior found such prediction to be highly inaccurate. Many social policy changes were implemented or recommended {{on the basis of}} that research. More recently, a second generation of research and theory on violence prediction has begun to develop that emphasizes the limitations of the existing body of research, points to possible improvements in predictive technology, and evaluates public policies involving violence prediction only {{in the context of the}} feasible alternatives to those policies. (AmJ Psychiatry 141 : 10 - 15, 1984) A decade ago a national movement was afoot to revise the criteria for civil commitment away from an assessment of a “need for treatment ” and toward a prediction of “dangerousness ” to others or to self. So appealing to the legal mind was the libertarian logic of the dangerousness model that by the mid- 1970 s virtu-ally every state had, if not entirely thrown <b>over</b> <b>need</b> for treatment in favor of dangerousness, at least graft-ed dangerousness on to its existing standards for commitment (1). Also a decade ago, indeterminate prison sentences were the rule throughout much of the United States. Persons convicted of crime were sent to prison with brief minimum and lengthy maximum sentences-i to 20 years, for example-and the decision about when within those broad constraints they were to be released was given to parole boards. These administrative agencies relied largely upon their own intuitive clinical judgments, sometimes aided by psychological and psy-chiatnic reports, to know the moment at which reha-bilitation had been achieved and the offender could be released without danger (2) ...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. The family {{business}} {{is often said}} to be a special kind of firm. It is special in the way family members involved combine family life and work. Therefore, it is difficult to view the business, the management and the ownership separately. In both advanced and developing economies, the great majority of business enterprises are family owned, and together they typically account for well over half of all existing and newly created jobs. Management succession in {{family business}} is an issue of growing importance. These businesses generate a significant proportion of the economic activities in many countries, and a majority of these businesses are approaching the point where business owners will most likely be making serious decisions regarding their long-term future. The manner in which such large numbers of potential business successions is managed will impact, not only upon these individual businesses but also upon the business sector and society more broadly. The problems encountered in the family business succession planning are generally human ones. Consequently, the areas most in need of consideration, the issues to be managed and the difficulties that must be overcome when family business plan for succession mostly revolve around relationships, individual attitudes and experiences, business and family cultures and the values and aspirations involved. This makes it unlikely that any single model or approach to family business succession planning can be applied in all situations. However, some common themes emerge from a study of the business succession planning literature and the suggested models on offer. The required successor attributes need to be identified and appropriate processes for selecting and nurturing a suitable successor determined. The timing and manner for any hand <b>over</b> <b>need</b> to be matched to existing circumstances. The role and need of all the important participants should be acknowledged. Future business planning and a family business vision shared by all should be established. Ownership, management and inheritances are importance issue and must be addressed. Maintaining good relationship and open communication process is vital. The future of the successor must be clearly determined and managed. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} assess management succession in black-owned family businesses in the Limpopo Province and make recommendations on how-these businesses can ensure the successful transfer of the business to the next generation of family members. It further addresses the importance of understanding business succession. It links aspects of succession planning and successor preparation to the effectiveness of the transition and performance of the business. The research was conducted by means of a literature and empirical study. The purpose of the literature study was to gain in-depth knowledge on family businesses and management succession. The literature study formed the basis of understanding family businesses and management succession. In light of the findings of the empirical study, it was concluded, that the most neglected things in ensuring management succession of black-owned family businesses are: succession planning, selection of a successor, retirement planning, communication and family forums within the family businesses.
