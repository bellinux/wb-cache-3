5|$|Genetics is {{believed}} {{to be involved in the}} majority of cases, either directly <b>or</b> <b>indirectly.</b> Some epilepsies are due to a single gene defect (1–2%); most are due to the interaction of multiple genes and environmental factors. Each of the single gene defects is rare, with more than 200 in all described. Most genes involved affect ion channels, either directly <b>or</b> <b>indirectly.</b> These include genes for ion channels themselves, enzymes, GABA, and G protein-coupled receptors.|$|E

5|$|Solar {{power is}} the {{conversion}} of sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), <b>or</b> <b>indirectly</b> using concentrated solar power (CSP). CSP systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. PV converts light into electric current using the photoelectric effect.|$|E
5|$|A bill providing, {{directly}} <b>or</b> <b>indirectly,</b> for the borrowing of money, {{the giving}} of any guarantee or {{the raising of}} any loan by the Government if, {{in the opinion of}} the President, the bill is likely to draw on reserves of the Government that the Government did not accumulate in its current term of office.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, France, Switzerland and San Marino were the only European nations to have a republican form of government. The ascent of republicanism to the {{political}} mainstream started only {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, facilitated by the toppling of various European monarchies through war or revolution; as at the beginning of the 21st century, most of the states in Europe are republics with either a directly <b>or</b> <b>indirectly</b> elected head of state.|$|E

5|$|Before version 3.0, Python had {{two kinds}} of classes: old-style and new-style. The syntax of both styles is the same, the {{difference}} being whether the class object is inherited from, directly <b>or</b> <b>indirectly</b> (all new-style classes inherit from object and are instances of type). In versions of Python 2 from Python 2.2 onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. Old-style classes were eliminated in Python 3.0.|$|E
5|$|Businesses {{that employ}} 50 {{or more people}} but do not offer health {{insurance}} to their full-time employees pay a tax penalty if the government has subsidized a full-time employee's healthcare through tax deductions or other means. This {{is commonly known as}} the employer mandate. This provision was included to encourage employers to continue providing insurance once the exchanges began operating. Approximately 44% of the population was covered directly <b>or</b> <b>indirectly</b> through an employer.|$|E
5|$|Complications {{are either}} {{directly}} caused by obesity <b>or</b> <b>indirectly</b> related through mechanisms sharing {{a common cause}} such as a poor diet or a sedentary lifestyle.

The invention is characterized in that in a method step C a diffusion barrier layer, which acts as a diffusion barrier at least with respect to aluminum, is applied <b>indirectly</b> <b>or</b> directly to the contact-connection layer, and in a method step D a solderable layer composed of a solderable material is applied <b>indirectly</b> <b>or</b> directly to the diffusion barrier layer, and in that the diffusion barrier layer and the contact-connection layer are applied {{by means of a}} PVD method...|$|R
5|$|Dengue can {{occasionally}} affect {{several other}} body systems, either in isolation or {{along with the}} classic dengue symptoms. A decreased level of consciousness occurs in 0.5–6% of severe cases, which is attributable either to inflammation of the brain by the virus <b>or</b> <b>indirectly</b> {{as a result of}} impairment of vital organs, for example, the liver.|$|E
5|$|Pilot {{control was}} entirely through a single side-mounted control stick. Pitch and roll were {{controlled}} through conventional fore-aft and side-to-side motions, while yaw {{could be controlled}} by twisting the stick. No mechanical linkages were used, the stick instead controlled the flow of high pressure air around the craft, which either directly attached to various control surfaces, <b>or</b> <b>indirectly</b> through local cable linkages to replace controls that were intended to be cable-actuated (like throttle controls on the engines).|$|E
5|$|Solar {{technologies}} are characterized as either passive or active {{depending on the}} way they capture, convert and distribute sunlight and enable solar energy to be harnessed at different levels around the world, mostly depending on distance from the equator. Although solar energy refers primarily {{to the use of}} solar radiation for practical ends, all renewable energies, other than Geothermal power and Tidal power, derive their energy either directly <b>or</b> <b>indirectly</b> from the Sun.|$|E

5|$|The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system {{comprising}} the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly <b>or</b> <b>indirectly.</b> Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, {{with the remainder}} being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies.

5|$|The {{avifauna}} of Puerto Rico {{is composed}} of 349 species, 18 of which are endemic to the archipelago. Almost half of the species (166) are accidental, meaning {{that they have been}} sighted only once or twice, and 42 of the species have been introduced, either directly <b>or</b> <b>indirectly</b> (mainly through habitat alteration), by humans. Approximately 120 species, including both native and introduced, breed regularly in the archipelago.|$|E
