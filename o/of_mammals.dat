5|$|A {{wide range}} of animals and insects live in Texas. It is the home to 65 species <b>of</b> <b>mammals,</b> 213 species of {{reptiles}} and amphibians, and the greatest diversity of bird life in the United States—590 native species in all. At least 12 species have been introduced and now reproduce freely in Texas.|$|E
5|$|About 17.8 percent——of {{the total}} forested area of Vietnam was sprayed during the war, which {{disrupted}} the ecological equilibrium. The persistent nature of dioxins, erosion caused by loss of tree cover, {{and loss of}} seedling forest stock meant that reforestation was difficult (or impossible) in many areas. Many defoliated forest areas were quickly invaded by aggressive pioneer species (such as bamboo and cogon grass), making forest regeneration difficult and unlikely. Animal-species diversity was also impacted; in one study a Harvard biologist found 24 species of birds and five species <b>of</b> <b>mammals</b> in a sprayed forest, while in two adjacent sections of unsprayed forest there were 145 and 170 species of birds and 30 and 55 species <b>of</b> <b>mammals.</b>|$|E

5|$|Dense moist {{deciduous}} forest mainly consists of sal, haldu, peepal, rohini and mango trees. Forest covers almost 73% of the park, 10% {{of the area}} consists of grasslands. It houses around 110 tree species, 50 species <b>of</b> <b>mammals,</b> 580 bird species and 25 reptile species.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are taken}} by a number <b>of</b> <b>mammals,</b> {{including}} American mink, striped skunk, otters, foxes and racoons, with the latter being responsible for nearly 40% of all nest failures. Birds such as herring gulls, northern ravens and American crows will eat unattended eggs. Because their nests are at the water's edge, common loon eggs are especially vulnerable if the adult is absent.|$|E

5|$|From the Greek {{word for}} pan pipes, σύριγξ, {{it is the}} vocal organ of birds. Located {{at the base of}} a bird's trachea, it {{produces}} sounds without the vocal folds <b>of</b> <b>mammals.</b> The sound is produced by vibrations of some or all of the membrana tympaniformis (the walls of the syrinx) and the pessulus, caused by air flowing through the syrinx. This sets up a self-oscillating system that modulates the airflow creating the sound. The muscles modulate the sound shape by changing the tension of the membranes and the bronchial openings. The syrinx enables some species of birds (such as parrots, crows, and mynas) to mimic human speech. Unlike the larynx <b>of</b> <b>mammals,</b> the syrinx is located where the trachea forks into the lungs. Thus, lateralization of bird song is possible and some songbirds can produce more than one sound at a time.|$|E
5|$|In a 1974 {{review of}} Miocene European talpids, John Howard Hutchison {{wrote that the}} astragalus of Veratalpa lacked any {{features}} that would ally it with talpids and commented that it was most likely a rodent.

5|$|In the 1990s, a {{minority}} scientific opinion emerged proposing that caviomorphs, such as guinea pigs, chinchillas, and degus, are not rodents {{and should be}} reclassified as a separate order <b>of</b> <b>mammals</b> (similar to lagomorphs). Subsequent research using wider sampling has restored consensus among mammalian biologists that the current classification of rodents as monophyletic is justified.|$|E

5|$|Mammals {{are rarely}} {{consumed}} by river otters, {{and are not}} a major dietary component. Mammals preyed upon by otters are characteristically small or are a type species found in riparian zones. The few occurrences <b>of</b> <b>mammals</b> found in the river otter's diet include: muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus); meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus); eastern cottontails (Sylvilagus floridanus); and snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus).|$|E
5|$|Mammals {{include the}} biggest animals on the planet, the great whales.
