Based on a survey of 1044 students it is demonstrated that some consumers may suffer from a "price differentiation bias", i. e., {{a fair number of}} consumers may overestimate the savings that result from reduced on-net and/or off-net charges, as they do not appear to weigh the prices with the probabilities of placing off-net and <b>on-net</b> <b>calls.</b> This may help to explain why it have been the smaller operators in various countries who have introduced on-net/off-net price differentiation. The paper also discusses the implications that such a consumer bias may have for market competition. Mobile telecommunications Price discrimination...|$|R

Moreover, it turns out that "bill and keep" arrangements may be welfare improving compared with cost based access pricing. ...|$|R
40|$|Mobile phone networks' {{practice}} of charging {{higher prices for}} off-net than for <b>on-net</b> <b>calls</b> has been pinpointed {{as the source of}} two competition problems: underprovision of calls and permanent disadvantages for small networks. We consider these allegations and four different remedies: limiting on/off-net differentials or off-net margins, lower termination fees, and asymmetric termination fees. In all cases a trade-off has to be made between efficiency and networks' profits on the one hand, and consumer surplus on the other. Indeed, the total welfare effects of regulating on/off-net differentials are ambiguous and depend on demand characteristics.

40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} the roles of local network effects induced by on-net/off-net price discrimination, and social network groups of mobile customers or calling clubs. A nationwide web-based survey of the Swedish mobile communications market in 2011 was distributed, and data were analysed by employing the factor analysis, cluster analysis and econometric model. The findings indicate that Swedish mobile consumers take three factors into account when subscribing to a specific mobile carrier: bundling, local network effects, and quality and tariff of service. According to cluster analysis, the characteristics of mobile consumers {{can be used to}} classify them into four groups: (1) Bundling-driven, (2) Network-effects-oriented, (3) No specific pattern and (4) Quality- and tariff-oriented, even though the respondents are heterogeneous. The characteristics {{of the members of the}} network-effects-oriented group are driven, in particular, by price awareness, experience of changing mobile operator, voice spending and age. Fewer members of this group than of the others pay monthly bills, however, though this is not statistically significant. The mobile consumers of small operators pay significantly more than those of large operators, even though all of the operators offered a discount on <b>on-net</b> <b>calls.</b> Based on these findings, the local network effects may create barriers to consumers switching, in particular consumers of large mobile operators, and also to small mobile operators competing with large ones. The regulator may then need to consider ways to make the mobile subscriber a well-informed consumer, and mobile operators would need to compete on both price and quality of service. This would result in greater competition in the mobile communications market...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{analyses}} {{the regulation}} of the market of voice call termination on mobile networks, by considering the remedy of asymmetric access charges and the hypothesis of discriminatory retail pricing. In the two way interconnection, the operators revenue depends on two factors: the retail price and the access charge. If the retail prices are different between calls that terminate on the same network (<b>on-net)</b> and <b>calls</b> that terminate on the rival network (off-net), the competition is more complex, involving positive networks externalities for the incumbent operator. In {{order to reduce the}} competitive disadvantage for new entrants and smaller operators many European regulation authorities have introduced the remedy of asymmetric access charges. This paper is aimed at analysing the effectiveness of this regulatory measure, assuming that operators are differentiated in terms of brand loyalty and cost structure...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} how stated-preference methods {{can be applied}} to modeling consumers' preferences in the field of mobile telecommunications, and to measuring and the valuation of network effects. We illustrate this with a case study of mobile phone operators in Poland. We utilize the Choice Experiment method and present the respondents with hypothetical choices of mobile phone operators, while explicitly controlling for network effects in the form of other users in the same network. Based on the hypothetical choices consumers make we construct a conditional random parameters multinomial logit model to analyze their preferences. This approach allows us to calculate welfare effects associated with alternatives, as well as marginal rates of substitution (and hence implicit prices) of the attributes used to describe the choices, such as operator brand and distribution of family and friends between available mobile networks. The latter constitutes a network effect as consumer's utility is influenced by the number (or ratio) of members of his or her family, friends and other users subscribed to the same operator. Our results confirm the existence of a strong network effect, which is related {{to the size of the}} social network group a particular subscriber belongs to, rather than the absolute size of the mobile operator's customer base. We observe that there are two sources of this 'gross' network effect - pecuniary (arising from possible price discounts for <b>on-net</b> <b>calls)</b> and non-pecuniary, and demonstrate a way to disaggregate them. In addition, we find that brand perception and brand loyalty are important determinants of operator choice. Finally, through the application of a non-market valuation method we are able to calculate monetary values of the network effect and brand loyalty, and both turn out to be relatively high. The results might be of a particular interest to mobile phone operators and regulatory authorities - we find that the capacity for vigorous price competition between mobile operators is limited due to significant non-price barriers which mitigate subscribers' mobility in the market. We demonstrate a way to measure these effects in monetary terms based on modeling of consumer preferences.

40|$|Advances in {{technology}} have enabled network-less mobile voice over internet protocol operator (MVoIPO) to offer data services (i. e. voice, text and video) to mobile network operator's (MNO's) subscribers through an application enabled on subscriber's user equipment using MNO's packet-based cellular network infrastructure. However, {{this raises the}} problem of how to handle interconnection settlements between the two types of operators, particularly how to deal with users who now have the ability to make ‘free’ <b>on-net</b> MVoIP <b>calls</b> among themselves within the MNO's network. This study proposes a service level agreement-based transparent settlement model (TSM) to solve this problem. The model is based on concepts of achievement and reward, not violation and punishment. The TSM calculates the MVoIPO's throughput distribution by monitoring the variations of peaks and troughs at the edge of a network. This facilitates the determination of conformance and non-conformance levels to the pre-set throughput thresholds and, subsequently, the issuing of compensation to the MVoIPO by the MNO as a result of generating an economically acceptable volume of data traffic...|$|R

We apply innovative implementation approach of utilizing high performance CUDA computing devices which allows us to consider population of up to 1 million consumers.

We discover that boundedly rational subscribers, who exploit simple decision heuristics to coordinate network choice within closed user groups, exert much stronger pressure on suppliers than fully rational ones. This leads to lower average calling costs, increased welfare and decreased monopolistic power of operators.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study {{different}} regulatory effects on termination charges and social welfare. We employ a framework with a fixed network and two mobile networks competing in a market to study the following regulatory regimes: collusive and social welfaremaximising reciprocity, uniform termination charge, asymmetric regulation, and direct calling price. We incorporate the idea of partial consumer ignorance when calling to a mobile user and allow the network operator to discriminate between <b>on-net</b> and off-net <b>calls</b> by setting differential calling prices. Compared to the uniform termination charge and asymmetric regulation, it is shown in this paper that the regulator can improve social welfare, without too much intervention, by imposing reciprocity on termination charges. We also find that with stronger consumer ignorance the regulator is more capable of improving social welfare. Further we show that, depending upon the extent of consumer ignorance, direct regulation of calling prices may be a welfare-improving alternative over regulation of termination charges.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{competition between}} two asymmetric networks, an incumbent {{and a new}} entrant. Networks compete in non-linear tariffs and may charge different prices for <b>on-net</b> and off-net <b>calls</b> (”on-net pricing"). The incumbent benefits from a larger installed base and consumers face switching costs. With on-net pricing, departing from cost-based access pricing allows the incumbent to foreclose the market in a profitable way. If the incumbent benefits from customer inertia, then it has an incentive to insist in the highest possible access markup even if access charges are reciprocal {{and even if the}} absence of actual switching costs. If instead the entrant benefits from customer activism, then foreclosure is profitable only when switching costs are large enough, and is best achieved through either a limited access markup or through an access subsidy. In all cases, foreclosure is profitable only when it keeps the entrant entirely out of the market. We also show that on-net pricing is a key factor. In its absence, foreclosure is either not profitable (in a caller pays regime) or not feasible (in a receiver pays regime). The analysis supports a qualified call for regulatory authorities to set bounds on access markups (and subsidies) and/or on-net pricing. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we utilize {{discrete}} choice experiment method {{to identify and}} measure switching costs and network effects in mobile telephony in Poland. Based on hypothetical choices consumers make we construct a conditional random parameters multinomial logit model to analyze their preferences. In our choice design we explicitly account for status quo inertia, number portability, operator brand, network distribution of most frequently called parties and price of <b>on-net</b> and off-net <b>calls.</b> Stated preference approach allows us to calculate marginal rates of substitution and hence implicit prices of the non-price attributes used to describe choices and switching behavior. Results of our study indicate that although choices of mobile operators are largely driven by price of calls, switching costs and network effects have and strong impact on utility of subscribers. In particular users assign positive value to their mobile phone number {{and the size of}} family and friends group in the same network. The monetary value of phone number is significantly higher among individual entrepreneurs then residential subscribers. In our model switching behavior is not discouraged by brand loyalty {{which turned out to be}} insignificant. Instead subscribers follow status quo inertia which reflects uncertainty associated with new operator. Therefore we conclude that despite introduction of mobile number portability, switching costs continue to be an important issue in telecommunications markets. On recommendations level, we argue that regulatory and competition policies should continue to reduce uncertainty associated with changing operator by ensuring service and platform compatibility and reducing tariff complexity. In light of our results we recommend tariffs to be non-discriminatory so that operators are unable to utilize network effects in a way which discourages switching behavior...|$|R
