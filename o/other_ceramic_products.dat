5000|$|The company {{gradually}} diversified its {{lines of}} technical ceramics before and especially after World War II. Coors greatly expanded its product lines, reduced scrap and accelerated production {{with the aid}} of cold isostatic pressing in the 1940s, tape casting and hot isostatic pressing in the 1950s, and multilayer ceramic capacitors in the 1960s. High-alumina (85 to 99.9% Al2O3) ceramics replaced porcelain in many thermomechanical, electrical and chemical applications. Coors engineers Vlad Wolkodoff and Bob Weaver invented fully dense, glass-free 99.5+% Al2O3 ceramics in 1964, useful for many applications where porcelain is deficient. [...] Growth in the 1970s enabled Coors to build an electronic ceramics plant east of Golden in 1970, and its first facility outside of Golden, an electronic substrate plant in Grand Junction, CO, in 1975. Coors made its first purchase of a competitor when it bought Wilbanks International Inc. (originally Far West Industrial Ceramics) of Hillsboro, OR, in 1973. Another competitor, Alumina Ceramics Inc. of Benton, AR, was acquired in 1976. [...] Coors opened its first foreign factory in Glenrothes, Scotland, in 1981.

Ceramic tiles were sieved into fine and coarse aggregates in line with standards. Other materials used were gravel, river sand, cement and potable water. Workability of the fresh concrete was checked through slump test, and concrete cubes of 150 mm dimensions and cylinders of 100 mm � 200 mm were cast in the laboratory. After 24 h of casting, the concrete samples were demolded and were cured by immersion in water tank at temperature of 22 �C. The compressive and split-tensile strengths of the hardened concrete samples were determined after curing them for 3, 7, 14 and 28 days.

50|$|After {{his debut}} at Charlottenborg's spring {{exhibition}} in 1951, he rapidly {{gained a reputation}} as a sculptor who crafted works of the human body and of animals with intense expressiveness and realism. His scenes of butchery became central to his work. At the end of the 1950s during a stay on the island of Bornholm, he entered a more abstract phase, experimenting with tiled pipes and <b>other</b> <b>ceramic</b> <b>products,</b> although he maintained elements of the body and other recognizable phenomena. During the dramatic years of the Algerian war, he settled in Paris creating figurative sculptures in bronze from 1959 to 1963. They depict scarred, torn organic forms reflecting a reality of cruelty, fear and sexuality.He has travelled widely to Italy, Germany, Spain and Yugoslavia, developing a style which was far removed from Danish culture. At the end of the 1960s, he often completed compositions made up of several smaller sculptures, sometimes using materials such as plastic or textiles, occasionally borrowing elements from other sculptors. After an interruption {{at the end of the}} 1960s when he turned to films, he returned to sculpture making use of marble, often combining different colours and finishes, as can be seen in his decorative work outside the School of Journalism in Aarhus. Other important works include the geometrical Huset der slikker solskin (The House which Licks Sunshine, 1980) for the Danish Institute in Rome, Dumhedens store flod (Stupidity's Great River, 1995) in Ribe, and Sorg (Sorrow, 1990) for the French University in Istanbul. His later work cften consists of large angular shapes with rough surfaces as his three sculptures for the University of Lund (1994) and his 7 meters tall Colossus at the Amager Beach Park in Copenhagen.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} is a large part {{proposed}} within the PhD thesis, which has the aim to present the current situation of those enterprises that activate in the ceramic sector in Romania's Center Region. The main goal of the PhD thesis {{is to increase the}} competitiveness, flexibility, adaptability and reactivity of enterprises in the ceramic industry. For this reason, we elaborated a questionnaire, which had the role of showing us how competitive, flexible, adaptable and reactive these enterprises are. The questionnaire was completed by companies that have the following main areas of activity: manufacture of household and ornamental ceramic products, manufacture of other technical ceramic products, manufacture of <b>other</b> <b>ceramic</b> <b>products,</b> manufacture of ceramic sanitary items and manufacture of ceramic insulators and ceramic insulating components. The research methodology is based on statistical analysis.

40|$|Ceramic {{properties}} of the loess in Nebraska have not been investigated prior to this work. It was the recognition of a need for ceramic materials that prompted the undertaking of this project. Experiments were conducted upon the firing of the Loveland and Peorian formations in southeastern Nebraska. The main purpose of the investigation {{was to determine the}} economic possibilities for utilization of Nebraska loess deposits, in manufacturing bricks and <b>other</b> <b>ceramic</b> <b>products.</b> Results of the fired samples from Nebraska City, West Point and Council Bluffs, Iowa show that the loess in these localities contain too much lime and the vitrified products are too sticky to be utilized in any vitrified products, especially light-weight aggregate, unless by addition of necessary foreign material, stickiness is reduced. The conclusion has been drawn that the loess of deposits of eastern Nebraska can be utilized for more ceramic products than they are at present. The loess is suitable for the manufacturing of relatively coarse and low-cost products. Its advantage lies in minimum mining costs, low firing temperatures, and application of standard methods of production. Products of this type include common bricks, face bricks, plaster tile, and drain tile. The loess would be a good raw material for coarse earthenware products, such a garden tools. In utilization of loess the manufacturers should be cautious and avoid zones of excess lime concentration. For commercial use of loess a raw material the site of a new ceramic plant should be chosen where the loess deposits are free of excess lime. Advisor:Charles M. Rile...|$|E

It was used with a pestle to purée or pulverise ingredients in order to prepare elaborate and carefully seasoned Roman dishes; the Roman culinary tradition made extensive use of herbs and spices. The mortarium was the Roman equivalent of the food-processor, and is a real indicator of 'romanisation'; In Britain, the first mortaria were being imported from Gaulish sources more than a generation before Britain became a Roman province in AD 43, indicating the growing influence of Roman culture in late Iron Age southern Britain, and perhaps the actual presence of immigrants from Gaul. Later, locally-made mortaria produced at specialised potteries in different areas of the province were available throughout Britain, in addition to imported products: Paul Tyers discusses mortaria from no fewer than 16 different manufacturing sources, Romano-British and Continental, that have been found in Britain. Like so many <b>other</b> specialised Roman <b>ceramic</b> <b>products,</b> many mortaria also bore workshop or makers' stamps on their rims, and noting their chronology and distribution can help archaeologists understand trading patterns and the Roman economy.|$|R

Background and Statement of Issues Brush <b>Ceramic</b> <b>Products</b> facility, located at 6100 South Tucson Boulevard, Tucson, Arizona, has produced beryllium oxide ceramic components since 1980. Beryllium is a hard, grayish metal naturally found in mineral rocks, coal, soil, and volcanic dust. Beryllium oxide is made from beryllium ores and is used to make specialty ceramics for electrical and high technology applications (ATSDR 2002; Kolanz 2001). Some people exposed to beryllium may develop a sensitization to the metal, which may lead to an allergic response. Some sensitized individuals may develop an inflammatory reaction in the respiratory system. That is called chronic beryllium disease (CBD). Long-term inhalation of beryllium can increase the risk of developing lung cancer in people.
