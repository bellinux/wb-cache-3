5|$|Each {{chromatophore}} contains pigment of only <b>one</b> <b>colour.</b> In {{fish and}} frogs, colour change is {{mediated by the}} type of chromatophores known as melanophores that contain dark pigment. A melanophore is star-shaped; it contains many small pigmented organelles which can be dispersed throughout the cell, or aggregated near its centre. When the pigmented organelles are dispersed, the cell makes a patch of the animal's skin appear dark; when they are aggregated, most of the cell, and the animal's skin, appears light. In frogs, the change is controlled relatively slowly, mainly by hormones. In fish, the change is controlled by the brain, which sends signals directly to the chromatophores, as well as producing hormones.|$|E

5|$|Sometimes {{the colour}} of a tile is {{understood}} {{as part of the}} tiling; at other times arbitrary colours may be applied later. When discussing a tiling that is displayed in colours, to avoid ambiguity one needs to specify whether the colours are part of the tiling or just part of its illustration. This affects whether tiles with the same shape but different colours are considered identical, which in turn affects questions of symmetry. The four colour theorem states that for every tessellation of a normal Euclidean plane, with a set of four available colours, each tile can be coloured in <b>one</b> <b>colour</b> such that no tiles of equal colour meet at a curve of positive length. The colouring guaranteed by the four-colour theorem does not generally respect the symmetries of the tessellation. To produce a colouring which does, it is necessary to treat the colours as part of the tessellation. Here, as many as seven colours may be needed, as in the picture at right.|$|E
5|$|Like the original, {{there are}} the {{challenge}} and head-to-head game modes. In challenge mode, players play a series of races against three opponents and must finish first or second to progress to the next race. If a good enough lap time {{on any of the}} earlier levels is achieved, players automatically win the race. Placing first three times in a row earns players the chance to win an extra life by playing a special round to collect vehicles within a time limit. Head-to-head is a game which involves one opponent achieving enough distance from opponents to be the only racer on the screen. This earns that player a point, represented by coloured lights on the screen: one light turns the colour of that player. If all eight lights are <b>one</b> <b>colour,</b> the player of that colour wins. If after three laps, the colours are mixed, the player with the most lights wins. Players are given thee lives in both modes. Players select a character, whose stats only affect computer-controlled players, to play as before racing.|$|E
5|$|Real's {{traditional}} away colours are all blue or all purple. Since {{the advent}} of the replica kit market, the club has also released various other <b>one</b> <b>colour</b> designs, including red, green, orange and black. The club's kit is manufactured by Adidas, whose contract extends from 1998. Real Madrid's first shirt sponsor, Zanussi, agreed for the 1982–83, 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons. Following that, the club was sponsored by Parmalat and Otaysa before a long-term deal was signed with Teka in 1992. In 2001, Real Madrid ended their contract with Teka and for one season and used the Realmadrid.com logo to promote the club's website. Then, in 2002, a deal was signed with Siemens Mobile and in 2006, the BenQ Siemens logo appeared on the club's shirt. Real Madrid's shirt sponsor from 2007 until 2013 was bwin.com following the economic problems of BenQ Siemens. It is currently Fly Emirates which is set to expire in 2018. In 2015, Madrid signed a new 10-year contract believed to be worth a total of £850 million (€1 billion), earning £59 million (€64 million) per season.|$|E

Fifteenth-century hose were often particolored, with each leg in a different-coloured fabric or even more than <b>one</b> <b>colour</b> on a leg. However, many types of braies, chausses and hose were not intended to be covered up by other clothing, so they were not actually underwear in the strict sense.|$|E

25|$|Some {{examples}} of Flemish bond incorporate stretchers of <b>one</b> <b>colour</b> and headers of another.

Some of the header faces are exposed to wood smoke, generating a grey-blue colour, while other simply vitrified until they reach a deeper blue colour. Some headers have a glazed face, caused by using salt in the firing. Sometimes Staffordshire Blue bricks are used for the heading bricks.|$|E
25|$|On Advance Direction Signs, as {{introduced}} {{under the}} Guildford Rules, the background colour indicates {{the category of}} route on which it is located. On all directional signs, destination names are placed on the colour appropriate to the category of route used from that junction. A panel of <b>one</b> <b>colour</b> on a different colour of background therefore indicates a change of route status. A smaller area of colour, called a patch, surrounds a bracketed route number (but not its associated destination) to indicate a higher status route that is joined some distance away. A patch may only be coloured blue or green.|$|E

These idents consisted of different background colours corresponding to the time of day behind a translucent CBC gem logo, accompanied by different arrangements of the CBC's new, orchestrated five-note jingle. The logo was changed to <b>one</b> <b>colour,</b> generally dark blue on white, or white on dark blue, in 1986.
