5|$|After the Acts of Union in 1707 {{the royal}} family spent very little time in, or money on, Scottish palaces and many Scottish nobles {{followed}} the royal court to England, tending to invest in sculpture for their residences in London, rather than their estates in Scotland. With the growth <b>of</b> <b>civic</b> development there was an increasing demand for public statuary, often with the patronage of a public institution, such as the lead figure of George II at the newly founded Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh in 1753 or {{the figure of the}} judge Duncan Forbes for the Outer Parliament House in 1752. The portrait bust, designed for interior display, also became popular. By the middle of the century statuary were preferred to painted portraits among the aristocracy.|$|E

The start of war in 1914 prevented implementation of his plans. In 1915, Chamberlain became Lord Mayor of Birmingham. Apart from his father Joseph, five of Chamberlain's uncles had also attained the chief Birmingham civic dignity: they were Joseph's brother Richard Chamberlain, William and George Kenrick, Charles Beale, who had been four times Lord Mayor and Sir Thomas Martineau. As a Lord Mayor in wartime, Chamberlain had a huge burden of work and he insisted that his councillors and officials work equally hard. He halved the Lord Mayor's expense allowance and cut back on the number <b>of</b> <b>civic</b> functions expected of the incumbent.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half of the nineteenth century, the British {{administration}} drew up an urban plan for the development of Chamba. They laid emphasis on the building <b>of</b> <b>civic</b> buildings around the Chaugan to conceal the unorthodox structural layout of the residential complexes. The western oriented development programme grew particularly active after the arrival of Major Blair Reid in January 1863, during the reign of Raja Shri Singh. The next fourteen years in particular, until his retirement in March 1877, were characterised by large-scale building projects in Chamba, with Reid fully revising the administrative and revenue departments of Chamba and reorganizing the state machinery to make development more efficient.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota {{is known}} for its {{progressive}} political orientation and its high rate <b>of</b> <b>civic</b> participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, a large number of European settlers entered the state who had mainly emigrated from Scandinavia and Germany. The state remains today a center of Scandinavian American and German American culture. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, the Horn of Africa, the Middle East and Latin America has broadened its historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota's standard of living index is {{among the highest in the}} United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation.|$|E
5|$|Neoclassicism was {{pioneered by}} Gavin Hamilton and his proteges, the {{brothers}} John and Alexander Runciman, and David Allan. Alexander Runciman pioneered historical painting and Alan helped develop genre art, {{both of which}} would be taken up by Scottish artists in the next century. After the Acts of Union in 1707 there was very little patronage for large and expensive works of art in Scotland. With the growth <b>of</b> <b>civic</b> development there was an increasing demand for public statuary and the portrait bust also became popular. Commissions of new statuary tended to be made in relatively cheap lead and even more economical painted or gilded plaster. From the late eighteenth century there are a handful of examples of work from Scottish artists.|$|E

5|$|Barrington Civic Center Historic District is a {{historic}} district in Barrington, Rhode Island on County Road. The district, which consists of the Barrington Town Hall, Leander R. Peck School and Prince's Hill Cemetery, is located on Prince's Hill {{near the center of}} Barrington. In 1728, Prince's Hill Cemetery was purchased and later expanded to its present size by 1898. The -story Barrington Town Hall was completed in 1888 and originally served as the seat of the town's government, library and high school. With the completion of the Leander R. Peck School in 1917, the high school moved into the adjacent building and the library used its space. The two-story Elizabethan Revival style Peck School is designed with a T-shaped plan and features a stairway to access the main entrance on the second story. The Peck School was later used by the fifth and sixth grade elementary students before becoming the public library. Also located within the district is Wood's Pond. The Barrington Civic Center Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, and serves as historically significant example <b>of</b> <b>civic</b> and natural environment planning of the late nineteenth century.|$|E
