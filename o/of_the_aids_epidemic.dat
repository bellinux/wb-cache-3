Uganda’s successful use of knowledge and research to help set public policy priorities demonstrates that even a poor postconflict country can, {{in a relatively short}} period of time, create an effective information base and feedback mechanisms for decisionmaking. Ugandan policymakers developed a reputation for being among the most committed economic reformers in Africa in the 1990 s when they established macroeconomic stability, stimulated rapid economic growth, and granted considerable personal and political freedom following a long period of economic decline, conflict, and repres-sive government. Circumstances in Uganda were favorable for innovation in that the country has relatively abundant land resources and some reforms could generate returns very quickly. At the same time, <b>the</b> legacy <b>of</b> conflict and <b>the</b> <b>aids</b> <b>epidemic</b> present difficult long-term challenges. During the 1990 s Uganda introduced innovations in several policy areas. The Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> late 1990 s, for example, owe their inter-national popularity to the Poverty Eradication Action Plan (peap) developed earlier in Uganda (and to similar efforts in Bolivia and Mozambique). The reform process in Uganda made use of various types of research, broadly de-fined as data, knowledge, statistical and other analyses, and dissemination. Some research outputs have been more important than others in influencing policy. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> public expenditure tracking studies have had dramatic effects on policy, and other types of research have helped improve <b>the</b> climate <b>of</b> ideas influencing policymakers. Other research has had little influence, either because the need for reform was already recognized, the policy implications were intellectually or po-litically controversial, or the findings were inadequately disseminated.

De modo mais especÃfico, busca-se explorar quais fatores individuais, sociais e programÃticos podem se estabelecer como incentivos e barreiras para a realizaÃÃo do teste de HIV, delineando o quadro de vulnerabilidades dos HSH. Ainda, explora-se como as recomendaÃÃes do MinistÃrio da SaÃde para a realizaÃÃo do teste de HIV sÃo entendidas e vivenciadas pelos HSH. O referencial teÃrico adotado foi construcionista e o quadro da vulnerabilidade foi o raciocÃnio utilizado como base de toda essa pesquisa. O estudo traz um {{panorama}} geral da epidemia da aids entre os HSH em nÃvel internacional e nacional, bem como as recomendaÃÃes polÃticas internacionais que influenciaram as respostas brasileiras ao HIV/aids, e a construÃÃo de polÃticas pÃblicas nacionais referentes ao teste de HIV. Essa pesquisa possui carÃter exploratÃrio, abordagem qualitativa e utilizou a metodologia do Rapid Assessment, de pressupostos antropolÃgicos. Foram realizadas 40 entrevistas semi-estruturadas com HSH de pelo menos 18 anos de idade, com sorologia para HIV positiva e negativa, e que nunca realizaram o teste, residentes na cidade de Fortaleza. As entrevistas foram realizadas em vÃrios lugares da cidade, a fim de alcanÃar uma amostra variada de informaÃÃes, sendo fixos apenas uma ONG e um ServiÃo de AtenÃÃo Especializada de referÃncia em HIV/aids. As informaÃÃes foram analisadas por meio da tÃcnica de anÃlise de conteÃdo do tipo categorial. Os resultados mostram que os motivos para a realizaÃÃo do teste de HIV entre os HSH foram: perceberem-se em risco, exigÃncia do parceiro, autocuidado e temor Ã doenÃa, doaÃÃo de sangue, incentivos dos profissionais da saÃde, oficinas de prevenÃÃo e eventos LGBT. JÃ as barreiras ao teste foram: pobreza, falta de conhecimento de modo geral sobre prevenÃÃo e transmissÃo do HIV, preconceito com as sexualidades nÃo heterosssexuais, estigma em relaÃÃo Ãs prÃticas homoerÃticas e Ã aids, homofobia, discriminaÃÃo referente Ã aids e baixa ou nenhuma percepÃÃo de risco. As barreiras programÃticas foram: falta de conhecimento acerca dos locais, dos procedimentos e do tempo confiÃvel para realizar o teste, descrenÃa das recomendaÃÃes de testagem do MinistÃrio da SaÃde, desconfianÃa da eficÃcia do teste rÃpido, homofobia, despreparo para lidar com questÃes da sexualidade homoerÃtica e emocionais decorrentes do resultado positivo entre os profissionais da saÃde, campanhas governamentais escassas e ineficazes para estimular a busca ao diagnÃstico e falta de reconhecimento com as polÃticas em HIV/aids criadas para HSH quando no cotidiano nÃo hÃ essa identidade. Os resultados mostram ainda que esses motivos possuem impacto direto no nÃo seguimento das recomendaÃÃes de testagem tornando a populaÃÃo HSH de Fortaleza vulnerÃvel Ã epidemia. Baseado no conceito ampliado de saÃde, polÃticas pÃblicas devem ser elaboradas considerando o conceito de integralidade de modo que essa populaÃÃo seja assistida em seus direitos, o que terÃ consequÃncia na reduÃÃo da vulnerabilidade ao HIV/Aids. This work aims {{to explore}} <b>the</b> contexts <b>of</b> vulnerability that interfere on <b>the</b> (non) realization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HIV test among {{men who have}} sex with other men. In a more specific way, it aims to explore which individual, social and programmatic factors may be established as encouragement and hurdles for <b>the</b> realization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HIV test, outlining <b>the</b> vulnerability framework <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Men Who Have Sex with Men (MSM). It also explores how <b>the</b> recommendations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ministry <b>of</b> Health for <b>the</b> realization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HIV test are extended and experienced by the MSM. The adopted theoretical reference was constructionist and the vulnerability framework was the reasoning used as a basis for the whole research. The study brings a general panorama <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aids</b> <b>epidemics</b> among <b>the</b> MSM on a national and international level, as well as the international recommendations policy that have influenced the Brazilian responses to HIV/aids, and <b>the</b> building <b>of</b> national public policies that refer to the HIV test. This research has an exploratory character, qualitative approach, and used <b>the</b> methodology <b>of</b> Rapid Assessment, which has anthropological presuppositions. Forty semi-structured interviews were done with MSM who were at least 18 years of age, with both positive and negative serology for HIV, and who had never done the test, living in <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> Fortaleza. <b>The</b> interviews were done in many places around the city, aiming to get a wider sample of information, being a constant for the research only a NGO and a Service of Specialized Attention of Reference to HIV/aids. The information was analyzed through <b>the</b> technique <b>of</b> content analysis that was category-based. The results show that the reasons for <b>the</b> realization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HIV test among the MSM were: they perceived they were at risk, a demand from the partner, self-care and fear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease, blood donation, encouragement from the healthcare professionals, prevention workshops and LGBT events. On the other hand, the barriers to the test were: poverty, lack of general knowledge about HIV prevention and transmission, prejudice against the non-heterosexual sexualities, stigma in relation to the homoerotic practices and to aids itself, homophobia, discrimination referring to aids and low or no perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> risk. The pragmatic barriers were: lack <b>of</b> knowledge about <b>the</b> places, the procedure and reliable time to do the test, discredit for the test recommendation from <b>the</b> Ministry <b>of</b> Health, discredit for <b>the</b> efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quick test, homophobia, lack of preparation to deal with questions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> homoerotic sexuality and emotional reasons deriving from the positive results among the healthcare professionals, lack of and inefficient governmental campaigns for the stimulation to look for the diagnosis and lack <b>of</b> identification with <b>the</b> HIV/aids policies created for MSM when in everyday life there is no such identification. The results also show that these reasons have a direct impact on <b>the</b> non-following <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recommendations <b>of</b> testing, making <b>the</b> MSM population from Fortaleza vulnerable to the epidemics. Based on <b>the</b> wide concept <b>of</b> health, public policies must be elaborated taking into consideration <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> integrality in such a way that this population can be assisted in their rights, which will have a consequence in <b>the</b> reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vulnerability to the HIV/aids...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reflected}} upon <b>the</b> historical roots <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{problems which}} prevent parents, {{teachers and the}} state from fulfilling their societal functions {{in such a way}} that a culture of teaching and learning is established. It was emphasised that during the traditional period (1554 - 1799) parents, teachers and the state (chiefs) played a leading role in <b>the</b> upbringing <b>of</b> children to <b>the</b> extent that there were few factors militating against <b>the</b> establishment <b>of</b> a culture of teaching and learning. From 1799 up to 1910 education was under <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> missionaries. Missionaries made <b>the</b> mistake <b>of</b> encouraging <b>the</b> weakening <b>of</b> traditional values once effectively employed in raising children. Parents were not given an opportunity to play an effective role in the education oftheir children. Schools lacked resources. Teachers were poorly paid and ill qualified. In spite of these shortcomings, missionaries did more good than harm in creating favourable conditions for teaching and learning. It was also indicated that from 1910 up to 1953 education was under <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> missionaries and provincial administrations (backed by the Union Government). The era was characterised by: • The state giving increasing financial assistance to schools • The teachers' fight for <b>the</b> improvement <b>of</b> their conditions of service and resources. • The limited participation given to parents in educational matters concerning their children. It was further indicated that when Bantu Education was introduced in 1953, schools became political battle-fields. Through <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> political organisations, parents, teachers and school children organised strikes took place in protest against the Bantu Education system. The state relied on repressive measures to control education. <b>The</b> activities <b>of</b> political organisations and the state led to <b>the</b> breakdown <b>of</b> <b>the</b> culture <b>of</b> teaching and learning. The threatening situation in the country towards the late 1970 s caused the state to realise <b>the</b> urgency <b>of</b> bringing reforms into education. The reforms brought about by the state were rejected by parents, teachers and school children. This resulted in <b>the</b> continuation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crisis in education. Despite <b>the</b> dawn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Dispensation in 1990 parents, teachers and the state are worried by the deepening education crisis manifested in factors such as violence, increasing use <b>of</b> drugs and <b>the</b> <b>Aids</b> <b>epidemic.</b> Finally, it was indicated that there are no instant solutions to the deepening education crisis. What is important is that parents, teachers and the state should make a united effort to bring about a gradual improvement. Educational StudiesD. Ed. (History of Education...|$|R

[...] Brian McNair, the author of Striptease Culture: Sex, Media and the Democratization of Desire, stated that upon the album's release [...] "academic books began to appear about the 'Madonna phenomenon', while pro- and anti-porn feminists made of her a symbol of all that was good or bad (depending on their viewpoint) about contemporary sexual culture." [...] Daryl Deino from The Inquisitr dubbed the album as [...] "a groundbreaking moment for feminism." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{specialist}} in hematology and oncology, and clinical {{professor at the}} New York University Medical Center, {{she was one of}} the first in the United States to recognize the appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIDS</b> <b>epidemic.</b> While working in private practice in New York City, she observed a sudden increase in the number of cases of Kaposi's sarcoma—a rare cancer that would later be identified as an AIDS-defining illness—in young gay men with immune deficiencies. With Alvin Friedman-Kien, a dermatologist, she co-authored the first published article on the appearance of Kaposi's sarcoma in gay men. The first patient she diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcoma, in 1979, was a gay man with a generalized rash and enlarged lymph nodes; two weeks later, a colleague asked her to see a second patient, another gay man, with the same disease. Both men turned out to be friends with Gaëtan Dugas—often called the [...] "patient zero" [...] of HIV/AIDS in North America (though more recent studies suggest otherwise)—who the men told Laubenstein had a similar rash. In 1981, when Dugas, a Canadian, heard about Kaposi's sarcoma, he traveled to New York from Montreal to consult with Laubenstein and Friedman-Kien and visited their practice for monthly chemotherapy treatments. By 1982, Laubenstein had treated 62 patients with Kaposi's sarcoma. She later left her university position to focus on treating AIDS patients in her private practice.|$|E

40|$|We {{are in a}} {{state of}} {{impending}} crisis. And the fault lies in part with academia. For two centuries or so, academia has been devoted to <b>the</b> pursuit <b>of</b> knowledge and technological know-how. This has enormously increased our power to act which has, in turn, brought us both all <b>the</b> great benefits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern world and the crises we now face. Modern science and technology have made possible modern industry and agriculture, <b>the</b> explosive growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world’s population, global warming, modern armaments and <b>the</b> lethal character <b>of</b> modern warfare, destruction of natural habitats and rapid extinction of species, immense inequalities of wealth and power across <b>the</b> globe, pollution <b>of</b> earth, sea and air, even <b>the</b> <b>aids</b> <b>epidemic</b> (<b>aids</b> being spread by modern travel). All these global problems have arisen because some of us have acquired unprecedented powers to act, via science and technology, without also acquiring the capacity to act wisely. We urgently need to bring about a revolution in universities so that the basic intellectual aim becomes, not knowledge merely, but rather wisdom – wisdom being the capacity to realize what is of value in life, for oneself and others, thus including knowledge and technological know-how, but much else besides. The revolution we require would put problems <b>of</b> living at <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> academic enterprise, <b>the</b> pursuit <b>of</b> knowledge emerging out of, and feeding back into, the fundamental intellectual activity of proposing and critically assessing possible actions, policies, political programmes, from <b>the</b> standpoint <b>of</b> their capacity to help solve problems of living. This revolution would affect almost every branch and aspect of academic inquiry...|$|R
