5|$|Malouma Mint Moktar <b>Ould</b> Meidah {{was born}} in Mederdra in the Trarza Region of {{south-western}} Mauritania, on October 1, 1960, the year the country gained independence from France. Born into a griot family, {{she grew up in}} the small desert village of Charatt, just south of Mederdra in West Africa. Her father, Mokhtar <b>Ould</b> Meidah, was a celebrated singer, tidinet player and poet while her grandfather, Mohamed Yahya <b>Ould</b> Boubane, is remembered as a talented writer and tidinet virtuoso. Her mother also came from a family of well-known traditional singers. She taught her daughter to play the ardin, a ten-stringed harp traditionally played by women, when she was six.|$|E
5|$|Formerly a district, in 1990 Nouakchott {{became a}} region of Mauritania. On 25 November 2014, it was split into the three current regions and its {{governor}} Mahi <b>Ould</b> Hamed became the first governor of Nouakchott-Nord.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the architects}} {{training}} and working in Douglas's office were influenced by him. Perhaps {{the best known of}} these were Edmund Kirby and Edward <b>Ould.</b> Kirby is best remembered for his Roman Catholic churches. <b>Ould</b> went on to design a number of buildings in Chester and further afield in a Douglas-like style, including notably Wightwick Manor and various buildings at Port Sunlight. Other architects who did not work in his office were also influenced by him; these include Thomas Lockwood, Richard Thomas Beckett, Howard Hignett, A. E. Powers, James Strong and the Cheshire County Architect, Henry Beswick.|$|E

5|$|Mauritania {{participated in}} seven Summer Olympic games between {{its debut in}} the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, United States and the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Two athletes from Mauritania were {{selected}} {{to compete in the}} Beijing games; Souleymane <b>Ould</b> Chebal in the track and field 800 meters and Bounkou Camara in the track and field 100 meters.|$|E
5|$|Nouakchott was a tiny, {{fortified}} {{fishing village}} (ksar) in pre-colonial times and under French rule. As Mauritania prepared for independence, it lacked a capital {{city and the}} area of present-day Nouakchott was chosen by Moktar <b>Ould</b> Daddah and his advisors. <b>Ould</b> Daddah desired for the new capital to be a symbol of modernity and national unity which ruled out existing cities or towns in the interior. The village {{was selected as the}} capital city for its central location between Saint-Louis, Senegal, the city from which the colony of Mauritania was governed, and Nouadhibou. Its location also meant that it avoided the sensitive issue of whether the capital was built in an area dominated by the Arab-descended Moors or Black Africans.|$|E
5|$|Discussing {{the larger}} culture of {{violence}} that Chicago police had created, journalist Spencer Ackerman in February 2015 reported that Zuley, by then retired from COPD, had served in 2003-2004 with the US Navy Reserve as an interrogator at Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba, established by the George W. Bush administration. (Zuley {{had returned to the}} CPD after his Navy service.) In 2003, one of his subjects was the high-profile detainee Mohamedou <b>Ould</b> Slahi, for whom the Secretary of Defense had authorized extended interrogation techniques, since classified as torture. Slahi's memoir, Guantanamo Diary, was published in January 2015, and quickly became an international bestseller. He detailed the torture he suffered. Ackerman noted that inmates with claims or suits against Zuley had recounted details that are similar to the physical and psychological abuse against Slahi. Local Chicago publications identified Zuley as a protege of Burge, but Ackerman said that the two officers never served together. Zuley primarily served on the North Side.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1887 case of Deaderick v. <b>Oulds,</b> the Supreme Court of Tennessee {{ruled on}} a case of trover. The defendant, <b>Oulds,</b> cut 800 walnut logs, branded them with the letter [...] "D", then {{proceeded}} to float them down a river {{with the intention of}} recovering them downstream. Sometime later, <b>Oulds</b> found an unmarked log among his other marked logs which had peculiar cracks at one end. He floated the unmarked log down the river, and it washed up on an island owned by the plaintiff, Deaderick, who then claimed the log as his in trover or replevin. The Tennessee court quoted the English case of Bridges v. Hawkesworth where the plaintiff, being in the shop of the defendant, picked up a parcel containing bank notes. The defendant, {{at the request of the}} finder, took charge of the notes, to hold for the owner. After three years, no one had come forth to claim them. The defendant shop owner refused to deliver them to the plaintiff. The court held the defendant shop owner liable in trover for the notes.|$|R

25|$|After holding various {{positions}} in the military, <b>Ould</b> Taya was appointed Chief of Staff of the Army in January 1981, during the rule of military head of state Mohamed Khouna <b>Ould</b> Haidalla. In {{the aftermath of a}} failed coup against <b>Ould</b> Haidalla in March 1981, <b>Ould</b> Taya was appointed Prime Minister on 25 April 1981, replacing civilian prime minister Sid Ahmed <b>Ould</b> Bneijara. He held this office until 8 March 1984, when <b>Ould</b> Haidalla, who was still head of state, took over the post. On 12 December 1984, while <b>Ould</b> Haidalla was out of the country, <b>Ould</b> Taya seized power and declared himself Chairman of the Military Committee for National Salvation.|$|E
25|$|Haidallah became prime {{minister}} on 31 May 1979, {{a few days}} after the death in an airplane crash of the previous {{prime minister}}, Col. Ahmed <b>Ould</b> Bouceif, with whom he had seized power for the CMSN just a month earlier, from Col. Mustafa <b>Ould</b> Salek and the CRMN. In January 1980 he seized power from <b>Ould</b> Salek's successor as head of state, Mohamed Mahmoud <b>Ould</b> Louly. He continued to also hold the position of Prime Minister until December of that year, when a civilian, Sid Ahmed <b>Ould</b> Bneijara, was appointed to the post.|$|E

50|$|Robert <b>Oulds</b> FRSA is a British Conservative {{politician}} and military historian. Previously a senior program producer at London Network Radio, {{he is now}} Director of the Bruges Group, a think tank based in London, and a councillor of the London Borough of Hounslow.|$|R
50|$|Its Director, Robert <b>Oulds,</b> is {{frequently}} {{quoted in the}} press and makes regular appearances on TV and radio discussing European issues.

25|$|Under <b>Ould</b> Taya, {{discrimination}} against the Afro-Mauritanian population became more pronounced. Thousands {{were forced to}} flee to Senegal and Mali. In {{the armed forces and}} the civil service, human rights abuses were common and many were killed. The last years of <b>Ould</b> Taya's rule were marred by unrest within the military and hostility between the regime and the country's Islamists. <b>Ould</b> Taya's harsh response to the religious opposition triggered criticisms from abroad. <b>Ould</b> Taya also moved away from his support of the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein {{at the time of the}} 1991 Gulf War, and moved towards the West. In late 1999, Mauritania established full diplomatic relations with Israel, becoming only the third Arab country to do so. In doing so, he had at some point formally ended a declared war on Israel that dated from the 1967 Six-Day War. <b>Ould</b> Taya's close ties with Israel and the United States served to deepen the opposition to his rule.|$|E
25|$|The new {{military}} dictatorship {{said it would}} remain in power for a maximum of two years to allow time for democratic institutions to be implemented. The Military Council for Justice and Democracy named Col. Ely <b>Ould</b> Mohamed Vall, a top associate of <b>Ould</b> Taya for many years, as its head.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oulds</b> {{was educated}} at the London Guildhall University, where in 2001 he gained the {{post-graduate}} degree of MA in Communications Management. In his final {{years as a}} student, from 1998 to 2001, he also worked for London Network Radio, producing sports programmes and commentating live on football matches.|$|R
25|$|The Tennessee Supreme Court {{observed}} it {{is essential}} in cases of trover, that the property must be found; it must {{at the time when}} the finder came upon it, to have been in such a situation as to clearly indicate that it was lost. It cannot have been placed there by the original owner who lost it by carelessness or forgetfulness, where it was later found by someone else. In such cases, the owner of the premises where the property is found is treated as a quasi-bailee (i.e. he holds the property for the original owner), and he may maintain trover against the finder. Since the log was not intentionally laid by the (unknown) owner on the land of the plaintiff (Deaderick), and hence he was not a quasi-bailee for the owner, he cannot hold against the superior right of the defendant (<b>Oulds)</b> arising out of his prior possession and earlier finding of the log. Judgment for ownership of the log was to the defendant <b>Oulds.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Oulds</b> is {{the author}} of Montgomery and the First War on Terror (2012). Bernard Law Montgomery faced guerrilla forces in Ireland in the early 1920s and again in Mandatory Palestine {{on the eve of the}} Second World War. The book deals with these parts of his career and also explores the lessons of his successes in those {{conflicts}} and how they should be applied in the present-day [...] "War on Terror" [...] in Afghanistan.|$|R
25|$|Born in {{the town}} of Atar (Adrar Region), <b>Ould</b> Taya {{attended}} a Franco-Arabic Primary School from 1949 to 1955. He then attended Rosso High School in southern Mauritania. After graduation, he attended a French military school in 1960 and graduated as an officer the next year. In 1975, he received strategic training at the French War Academy. In 1978 the Mauritanian army seized power and ousted President Moktar <b>Ould</b> Daddah, in an attempt to forestall government collapse in the war over Western Sahara against the Polisario Front (1975–79). <b>Ould</b> Taya was among the conspirators, and quickly gained influence within the government.|$|E

50|$|He {{was adopted}} as the Conservative {{prospective}} parliamentary candidate for Slough, but was deselected after allegations {{had appeared in}} The Sun and The Financial Times regarding firearms offences. The newspapers later had to apologise to <b>Oulds</b> and paid him damages and legal costs. He was then Chairman of the Slough Conservative Association, serving from 2006 to 2008. From 2013 to 2016 {{he returned to the}} same role as Chairman of the Brentford and Isleworth Conservative Association, covering the constituency where he is a borough councillor.|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{develop a new}} method of {{diagnosing}} the nervous system diseases and a new approach in studying human gait dynamics {{with the help of}} the theory of discrete non-Markov random processes. The stratification of the phase clouds and the statistical non-Markov effects in the time series of the dynamics of human gait are considered. We carried out the comparative analysis of the data of four age groups of healthy people: children (from 3 to 10 year olds), teenagers (from 11 to 14 year <b>oulds),</b> young people (from 21 up to 29 year <b>oulds),</b> elderly persons (from 71 to 77 year olds) and Parkinson patients. The full data set are analyzed {{with the help of the}} phase portraits of the four dynamic variables, the power spectra of the initial time correlation function and the memory functions of junior orders, the three first points in the spectra of the statistical non-Markov parameter. The received results allow to define the predisposition of the probationers to deflections in the central nervous system caused by Parkinson's disease. We have found out distinct differencies between the five submitted groups. On this basis we offer a new method of diagnostics and forecasting Parkinson's disease.

60|$|To those, however, to {{whom the}} {{theological}} aspect is still a stumbling block, I would recommend the reading of two short books, each of them by clergymen. The one is the Rev.

5000|$|<b>Oulds</b> is the Director of the Bruges Group, a {{think tank}} which {{concentrates}} on {{the debate about the}} British relationship with the European Union and the wider world. Set up in February 1989, its inspiration was Margaret Thatcher's Bruges speech in September 1988, in which she remarked that, [...] "We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at a European level". The Bruges Group's research now aims to promote less centralised European structures than those of the EU and explores a complete restructuring of Britain's relationship with other European countries.|$|R

40|$|Process {{modelling}} is used {{to reveal}} the structure of business processes in a port.

The main advantages of this method are that an overall picture {{of the business of}} a complex organisation such as a port can be drawn, and that essential elements of the business can be distinguished from secondary elements. An initial process architecture of the business of Alexandria Port is developed from the essential elements, the most important of which are ship and shipment. The architecture makes visible ways in which processes connect with and may affect one another. An architecture derived from essential elements can {{serve as the basis for}} a comparison of Alexandria Port with other ports, or for a redesign of some of the processes in order to streamline the business or to introduce new technological support...|$|R
