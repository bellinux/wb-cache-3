5|$|WCSP-FM is {{the first}} radio station to {{broadcast}} audiotape of historical U.S. Supreme Court <b>oral</b> <b>arguments,</b> with announcers explaining the court decision {{at the end of}} the recording. The broadcasts of the Supreme Court arguments have provided listeners in the U.S. and Canada with the opportunity to hear spoken words during <b>oral</b> <b>arguments</b> for several of the Court's most influential cases, including the Texas v. Johnson argument over flag-burning in 1989, and the Miranda v. Arizona argument in 1966. In September 2010 the Supreme Court began releasing audio recordings of the week's <b>oral</b> <b>arguments</b> each Friday, thereby allowing C-SPAN Radio to broadcast a selection of current arguments. Prior to this arrangement, recordings of <b>oral</b> <b>arguments</b> were occasionally made available on a same-day basis, which C-SPAN would request in cases of high public interest.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court heard <b>oral</b> <b>arguments</b> in {{the case}} on October 4, 2000, issuing its {{decision}} four months later.|$|E
5|$|During oral {{argument}} before the Court, Scalia asked more questions and made more comments {{than any other}} justiceâ€”and a 2005 study found that he provoked laughter more often {{than any of his}} colleagues did. His goal during <b>oral</b> <b>arguments</b> was to get across his position to the other justices.|$|E
5000|$|During the {{proceedings}} for their Motion to Dismiss, after the <b>oral</b> <b>argument</b> of the motion, the RIAA's lawyers {{asked for a}} second <b>oral</b> <b>argument.</b> According to Ray Beckerman this was unusual: ...|$|R
50|$|While the Court's appellate {{jurisdiction}} is mandatory, {{it is not}} required to hear <b>oral</b> <b>argument.</b> Approximately 60-75% of its decisions are rendered on briefs. If a case involves a novel question of law or the justices desire clarification, <b>oral</b> <b>argument</b> is called. Each attorney in <b>oral</b> <b>argument</b> is given 20 minutes to present its side, except for capital cases, in which each side is given 30 minutes.|$|R
25|$|The <b>oral</b> <b>argument</b> in Bush v. Gore {{occurred}} on December 11. Theodore Olson, a Washington, D.C. lawyer and future Solicitor General, delivered Bush's <b>oral</b> <b>argument.</b> New York lawyer David Boies argued for Gore.|$|R
5|$|Justice Antonin Scalia {{was present}} during <b>oral</b> <b>arguments.</b> He {{passed away in}} February, voiding his vote in the initial vote on the case's outcome and precluding any draft opinion he may have written from being {{published}} by the Court. The Court's 6-2 opinion was delivered on April 20, 2016.|$|E
5|$|Judges Stephen Reinhardt, Raymond C. Fisher and Richard R. Clifton (nominated to {{the court}} by presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush respectively) were empaneled to hear the case. After <b>oral</b> <b>arguments</b> in May 2007, they {{announced}} their decision ten months later, in March 2008. Unanimously, they reversed Moskowitz and ruled that the KD II was not a fishing vessel, therefore the fins had not been lawfully seized.|$|E
5|$|On January 6, 2009, Coleman's {{campaign}} {{filed an}} election contest, {{which led to}} a trial before a three-judge panel. The trial ended on April 7, when the panel ruled that 351 of 387 disputed absentee ballots were incorrectly rejected and ordered them counted. Counting those ballots raised Franken's lead to 312 votes. Coleman appealed to the Minnesota Supreme Court on April 20. On April 24, the Minnesota Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. <b>Oral</b> <b>arguments</b> were conducted on June 1.|$|E
50|$|Jones {{scheduled}} <b>oral</b> <b>argument</b> for November 26 on {{all issues}} in the case, but on September 19 he canceled the <b>oral</b> <b>argument</b> and announced he would rule {{on the basis of}} the briefs alone.|$|R
50|$|Paul Clement, Principal Deputy Solicitor General at the time, gave <b>oral</b> <b>argument</b> for the United States (Rumsfeld); Jennifer Martinez, a law {{professor}} and human rights lawyer, gave <b>oral</b> <b>argument</b> on behalf of Padilla and Newman.|$|R
50|$|<b>Oral</b> <b>argument</b> is {{not always}} {{considered}} {{an essential part of}} due process, as the briefs also give the parties an opportunity to be heard by the court. Whether a court will permit, require, or guarantee the opportunity to present <b>oral</b> <b>argument</b> is usually left up to each court to decide as part of its rules of procedure, with differences from court to court even within a single jurisdiction. Some courts may guarantee the right to present <b>oral</b> <b>argument,</b> either requiring the parties to request to present or their waiver if they do not wish to, while other courts may require <b>oral</b> <b>argument</b> without the ability to waive it. Courts may also have the discretion to decide a case without presentation of <b>oral</b> <b>argument,</b> rendering their judgment entirely based on the arguments set forth in the parties' briefs.|$|R
5|$|Sotomayor's {{first major}} written opinion was a dissent in the Berghuis v. Thompkins case dealing with Miranda rights. As {{her first year}} neared completion, Sotomayor said she felt swamped by the {{intensity}} and heavy workload of the job. During the <b>oral</b> <b>arguments</b> for National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, Sotomayor showed her increasing familiarity with the Court and its protocols by directing the opening questions of the arguments to Donald Verrilli, the Solicitor General who was representing the government's position.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} argued {{before the court}} on March 28, 2006. Katyal argued on behalf of Hamdan, and Paul Clement, the Solicitor General of the United States, argued {{on behalf of the}} government. Chief Justice Roberts recused himself because he had {{previously}} ruled on this case as part of the three judge panel on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Critics called for Justice Antonin Scalia to recuse himself, since he had made allegedly improper comments about the decision of the case prior to hearing <b>oral</b> <b>arguments</b> ("I'm not about to give this man who was captured in a war a full jury trial. I mean it's crazy") but he chose not to do so.|$|E
5|$|Following the Third Circuit's decision, Heffernan {{petitioned the}} Supreme Court for certiorari, {{requesting}} {{they hear the}} case. After the Court considered both Heffernan's petition and the city's reply, it granted the petition {{on the first day}} of the 2015 term. Both parties consented to the filing of amicus curiae briefs by uninvolved parties who believed they had a stake in the outcome of the case. The National Association of Government Employees, Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, and Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression filed amicus briefs in support of Heffernan, while the New Jersey State League of Municipalities and the National Conference of State Legislatures filed briefs in support of the City of Paterson. The United States government also filed an amicus brief in support of Heffernan, as well as a motion to appear at oral argument, which the Court granted, meaning the Solicitor General's office would be appearing at <b>oral</b> <b>arguments,</b> held on January 19, 2016.|$|E
25|$|Less {{than two}} months after <b>oral</b> <b>argument,</b> the justices ruled 7-1 for Buckeye. O'Connor had retired and been {{replaced}} by Samuel Alito, who as he had not seated for <b>oral</b> <b>argument</b> took no part in the decision.|$|R
50|$|The couple {{appealed the}} {{district}} court's decision to the Minnesota Supreme Court. The Court heard <b>oral</b> <b>argument</b> {{in the case}} on September 21, 1971. During the <b>oral</b> <b>argument,</b> while Baker and McConnell's lawyer was presenting his case, Justice Fallon Kelly turned his chair around, thus literally turning {{his back on the}} attorney. The justices did not ask a single question during the <b>oral</b> <b>argument</b> to Baker and McConnell's lawyer or to the assistant county attorney who represented the clerk.|$|R
25|$|<b>Oral</b> <b>argument</b> {{occurred}} on May 12.|$|R
5|$|However, the court's {{role was}} to rule on whether {{publication}} was legal, not whether it was wise. In keeping with the usual practice of keeping {{a temporary restraining order}} in effect for as short a time as possible, Warren ordered that hearings be held on a preliminary injunction in one week's time, on March 16. At the request of both parties, this was postponed to March 26 so they would have time to file their briefs and affidavits. The parties were therefore back in court again on March 26 for a hearing on the government's request for a preliminary injunction. Warren decided not to hold an evidentiary hearing at which the opposing teams of experts could be cross examined. He also declined a suggestion by the Federation of American Scientists in its amicus curiae brief that a panel of experts be charged with examining the issue. The case relied on written affidavits and briefs, and the opposing counsels' <b>oral</b> <b>arguments.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Ex parte Bollman (1807), the Court {{granted the}} writ to {{two members of}} the Burr conspiracy. Dr. Erick Bollman and Samuel Swartwout, having been apprehended in New Orleans, were transported to Charleston and then Baltimore on a navy vesselnotwithstanding the writs of habeas corpus issued by a {{territorial}} judge in New Orleans and a district judge in Charlestown. The United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia issued an arrest warrant for Bollman and Swartwout (who were already in military custody), slated the case for trial in D.C., and denied the prisoners bail; Judge William Cranch (also the Supreme Court's reporter of decisions) dissented in part on the ground that there was no probable cause for the arrest warrant as required by the Fourth Amendment. The Senate passed, but the House rejected, legislation that would have suspended the writ for three months and legalized Bollman and Swartwout's arrests. Nearly every member of Congress attended the <b>oral</b> <b>arguments</b> in the Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|On December 29, 2014, Bank Markazi filed a {{petition}} for certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States, requesting the Court {{to consider the}} question: Does Â§8772 violate {{the separation of powers}} by purporting to change the law for, and directing a particular result in, a single pending case? The certiorari petition was circulated to the Justices for their conference on April 3, 2015, after a brief by the respondents (Peterson) opposing certiorari and a reply brief from the petitioner (Bank Markazi) were filed in March. Following the April 3rd conference, the Court called for the Solicitor General to file a brief expressing the views of the federal government, which was filed on August 19. In May and June, the Supreme Court meets only to issue orders and opinions and does not hear <b>oral</b> <b>arguments</b> until the next term begins. The Court granted certiorari following its conference on September 28.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the court}} grants review, and in cases {{involving}} mandatory review, the parties are notified of the briefing requirements under the court's rules. In most cases, <b>oral</b> <b>argument</b> is scheduled following submission of briefs, but the court decides {{a number of cases}} without <b>oral</b> <b>argument.</b> The court notifies the parties and counsel of the <b>oral</b> <b>argument</b> date, and the <b>oral</b> <b>argument</b> schedule is posted on the court's website. In a typical case, each counsel is given 30 minutes to present argument, on behalf of their client, to the court. Unlike most civilian criminal jurisdictions in the United States, the military does not require that a defendant prove an inability to pay in order to receive defense counsel at government expense.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{would say}} that asking for a second <b>oral</b> <b>argument</b> is unusual, because (a) in almost 31 years of working in {{litigation}} Iâ€™ve never heard of anyone doing it, and (b) the very asking for it is an admission that the first <b>oral</b> <b>argument</b> was lost." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Oral</b> <b>argument</b> for {{the appeal}} {{was held on}} July 30, 2013 in Boston, and the opinion issued on Nov. 13 of that year. At <b>oral</b> <b>argument,</b> Mehanna's side was argued by P. Sabin Willett, and the United States was {{represented}} by Liza Collery of the Department of Justice.|$|R
5|$|Primarily {{an appeals}} court, the Oregon Supreme Court {{is also the}} court of last resort in Oregon. Although most <b>oral</b> <b>arguments</b> before the court are held in the Oregon Supreme Court Building, the court does travel around the state holding {{sessions}} in various schools. All cases are heard en banc by the court. It receives appeals from the Oregon Tax Court, the Oregon Court of Appeals, and some select cases such as death penalty appeals. Decisions of the court are published in the Oregon Reporter published by the Oregon Judicial Department. The Territorial Supreme Court was created in 1848 when the Oregon Territory was formed {{out of the old}} Oregon Country region, followed by the creation of the State Supreme Court in 1859 when Oregon was admitted to the Union on February 14.|$|E
5|$|Schmerber {{submitted}} {{an appeal}} to the Supreme Court of the United States, which granted certiorari on January 17, 1966. In his brief, Schmerber argued, inter alia, that the warrantless blood test violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unlawful searches and seizures, as well as his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The Los Angeles City Attorney's office represented the State of California on appeal. In their brief, the City Attorney argued that the blood test did not violate the Fourth Amendment because the seizure was conducted incident to a lawful arrest. The City Attorney also argued that admitting the sample into evidence did not violate Schmerber's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination because blood is not testimonial evidence under the Fifth Amendment. <b>Oral</b> <b>arguments</b> were held on April 25, 1966, and the Court issued its opinion on June 20, 1966.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court of Indiana has {{original}} and sole jurisdiction in certain specific areas, including {{the practice of}} law, discipline or disbarment of judges appointed to the lower state courts, and supervision over the exercise of jurisdiction by the other lower courts of the state. When the Court accepts a case, it reviews the documentation of the trials in the lower court and sometimes allows <b>oral</b> <b>arguments</b> before making a decision. In some cases the justices will issue a decision without hearing arguments from either side and will base their decision solely on evidence submitted in the lower courts. The Court can order a new trial {{to take place in}} the local court, overturn the decision of lower courts and enforce its own decision, or uphold the decision of lower courts.|$|E
