40|$|In {{many rural}} regions, {{there is a}} lack <b>of</b> orderly <b>sewage</b> <b>disposal.</b> Due to the high {{building}} costs of sewers, a connection to central sewage plants is usually not defensible. In this case, a decentralised <b>sewage</b> <b>disposal</b> provides a economical solution. The planner of such a disposal has to find a favourable allocation structure <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> plants and sewers as well as a favourable wastewater treatment technology for a specific plant location. These tasks both can not be solved separately since the chosen structure considerably influences the set of admissible technologies. The Technology, information and Consulting System for Decentralised Sewage Plants (TECIS) supports the planner solving this planning problem. TECIS can be used in two modes. In the information mode the user can investigate various information concerning waste water treatment. The consulting mode gives active support for solving the planner's decision problem. From the description of the places to be disposed and the pot ential locations for the sewage plants the set of feasible structures is generated. For each structure the feasible wastewater treatment technologies are chosen from a knowledge component and rated by some objective functions determined by the user. In this way a set of alternatives for the planning problem is generated. By means of several methods the planner can choose a best alternative <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>disposal</b> for the given region...|$|R
40|$|Clostridium perfringens, {{a marker}} <b>of</b> {{domestic}} <b>sewage</b> contamination, was enumerated in sediment samples {{obtained from the}} vicinity of the 106 -Mile Site 1 month and 1 year after cessation <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>disposal</b> at this site. C. perfringens counts in sediments collected at the disposal site and from stations 26 nautical miles (ca. 48 km) and 50 nautical miles (ca. 92 km) to the southwest of the site were, in general, more than 10 -fold higher than counts from an uncontaminated reference site. C. perfringens counts at the disposal site were not significantly different between 1992 and 1993, suggesting that sewage sludge had remained in the benthic environment at this site. At stations where C. perfringens counts were elevated (i. e., stations other than the reference station), counts were generally higher in the top 1 cm and decreased down to 5 cm. In some cases, C. perfringens counts in the bottom 4 or 5 cm showed a trend of higher counts in 1993 than in 1992, suggesting bioturbation.

40|$|Wastewater {{disposal}} {{in coastal}} waters causes widespread environmental problems. Secondary treatment {{is expected to}} reduce the adverse effects of insufficiently treated wastewater. The environmental impact <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>disposal</b> via 18 wastewater treatment plants was analysed using the benthic opportunistic polychaetes and amphipods (BOPA) index. In previous studies this index {{proved to be an}} effective tool for monitoring sewage pollution. The impact of these discharges was highly related to treatment level, which ranged from pre-treatment to biological, as well as to flow rates and outfall position. Locations affected by pre-treated wastewater showed environmental degradation, especially marked near outfalls with higher flow rates. At most locations, biologically treated wastewater did not cause a significant impact and an improvement in ecological integrity was detected after this secondary treatment had been implemented. The impact of discharge was highly related to chemical oxygen demand (COD), suspended solids and nutrient concentrations, which are all lower in biologically treated wastewater. A ‘moderate’ ecological status was observed not only near sewage outfalls with high wastewater flow rates (> 1, 500, 000 m 3 /month) with a COD over 200 mg/l but also near those with lower flow rates but with a COD over 400 mg/l. To reduce the impact <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>disposal,</b> it is necessary to carry out adequate treatment, have site outfalls deep enough, and implement water recycling.
