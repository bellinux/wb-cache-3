6000|$|... "Besides," [...] he said, moodily, [...] "I foresee changes here which he, {{young as}} he is, will not brook. If then at present I decline your kind <b>offer</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>name,</b> I {{think that the}} time is not far off when he may remind you of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Having {{arranged}} this much, I {{thought of}} you. I {{know that you}} have several sons. If you have one of from fourteen to sixteen years, and you would like him to take such a position for two or three years, I should be glad indeed to secure such a companion for my nephews. If not, would you do me the favour of looking round among your acquaintances and find us a lad such as we need. He must be a gentleman and a fair type of the boy we are speaking of. I may say that my brother authorizes me to <b>offer</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>name,</b> in addition to all expenses, two thousand francs a year to the young gentleman who will thus benefit his sons. I do not think that the political excitement which is agitating Paris need be taken into consideration. Now that great concessions have been made to the representatives of the nation, {{it is not at all}} probable that there will be any recurrence of such popular tumults as that which brought about the capture of the Bastille. But in any case this need not weigh in the decision, as my brother resides for the greater part of the year in his chateau near Dijon in Burgundy, far removed from the troubles in the capital." ...|$|E

After he died all three press associations held a memorial meeting <b>in</b> <b>his</b> honour, and at which one of Jon's best loved pieces, made using three different clays joined together, was presented to the journalists by his children. Since then an annual scholarship for journalism is <b>offered</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>name.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The great {{differences}} between the sees of York and Canterbury were settled during John's time as archbishop. It was arranged that each primate should carry his cross erect {{in the province of}} the other; but, as an acknowledgement of this concession, Thoresby, within the space of two months, and each of his successors within the same period after his election, was to send a knight or a doctor of laws to <b>offer</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>name,</b> at the shrine of St. Thomas of Canterbury, an image of gold to the value of £40, in the fashion of an archbishop holding a cross or some other jewel. It was at this time also, that Pope Innocent VI made, in Fuller's words, [...] "a new distinction - primate of All England, and Primate of England: giving the former to Canterbury and the latter to York. Thus, when two children cry for the same apple, the indulgent father divides it betwixt them. Yet so that he giveth the bigger and better part to the childe that is his darling." ...|$|E

60|$|As the discontented {{dependant}} {{left the}} apartment, he met, {{at the head}} of the grand staircase, Christian himself, who, exercising the freedom of an ancient friend of the house, was making his way, unannounced, to the Duke's dressing apartment. Jerningham, conjecturing that his visit at this crisis would be anything but well timed, or well taken, endeavoured to avert his purpose by asserting that the Duke was indisposed, and <b>in</b> <b>his</b> bedchamber; and this he said so loud that his master might hear him, and, if he pleased, realise the apology which he <b>offered</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>name,</b> by retreating into the bedroom as his last sanctuary, and drawing the bolt against intrusion.|$|R

50|$|Upon {{arriving}} at EWU, Trejo led a week long sit-in {{with the students}} at the President’s office to emphasize the need to support Latino students. As an educator, Trejo worked very closely with his students, especially his Latino students as he recognized that many of them were striving to become first generation college graduates. He was a huge advocate for the Latino and Chicano students, and welcomed hundreds of them from EWU and neighboring universities to his home and studio. In 1977, he co-founded the Chicano Education Program which strives to provide and increase the career and higher education opportunities offered to Latino students, as well as educate the general population on Latino heritage and the Chicano Movement. His efforts at EWU were well recognized among the faculty and staff alike, as he was awarded the EWU Trustee Medal in 1987. Trejo also has a scholarship <b>offered</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>name,</b> called the Ruben Trejo Hispanic Scholarship which is granted annually to a qualifying Latino or Chicano student pursuing an undergraduate degree in art.|$|R

5000|$|The mythological {{story of}} Sangini {{goes back to}} the mythic story of Hindu god Shiva and goddess Parvati. It was goddess Parvati whose heart was filled with torment and agony to see many of the young widows who lost their husband in the early age. Goddess Parvati pleads to Shiva to save the young married girls from their curse. Shiva {{advocated}} Parvati to ask these young married girls to <b>offer</b> puja <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>name.</b> Hence, it is possibly believed that they would be saved from being untimely widow if they offer pujas to Shivji.|$|R

50|$|Jan Muskata, Bishop of Cracow, who was Wenceslaus II of Bohemia's advisor, was {{the first}} to propose that Wenceslaus II's son and namesake should be elected king of Hungary. The younger Wenceslaus was not only Béla IV of Hungary's great-great-grandson, but also the bride of the late Andrew III of Hungary's daughter. Bribed by Wenceslaus II's agents, the {{majority}} of the Hungarian lords and prelates decided to offer the crown to the young Wenceslaus and sent a delegation to his father to Bohemia. Wenceslaus II met the Hungarian envoys in Hodonín in August and accepted their <b>offer</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eleven-year-old son's <b>name.</b> Wenceslaus II accompanied his son to Székesfehérvár where John Hont-Pázmány, Archbishop of Kalocsa, crowned the young Wenceslaus king with the Holy Crown on 27 August. Wenceslaus who assumed the name Ladislaus signed all his charters under that name in Hungary.|$|R
50|$|About 1786, Oulton left Dublin, still a youth, to try <b>his</b> {{fortunes}} <b>in</b> London. John Palmer, the lessee of the Royalty Theatre in Wellclose Square, {{accepted the}} offer of <b>his</b> services, and <b>in</b> 1787 he produced Oulton's ‘Hobson's Choice, or Thespis in Distress,’ a satire on contemporary theatrical enterprise. Its boldness annoyed the managers of the patent-houses, who {{were engaged in a}} fierce struggle with Palmer. Oulton then induced an acquaintance to <b>offer</b> <b>in</b> her <b>name</b> <b>his</b> next piece, ‘As it should be,’ to George Colman the younger of the Haymarket, where it was produced on 3 June 1789. The piece was published anonymously; but Colman discovered its author, and gave Oulton much encouragement. On 7 July 1792 he produced a short piece by Oulton, ‘All in Good Humour’ (London, 1792); there followed at the same house ‘Irish Tar,’ a musical piece, 24 August 1797; ‘The Sixty-third Letter,’ a musical farce, 28 July 1802; ‘The Sleep-walker, or which is the Lady?’ 15 June 1812; and ‘My Landlady's Gown,’ 10 August 1816. Meanwhile, at Covent Garden, Oulton secured the production of two similar pieces, ‘Perseverance,’ 2 June 1789, and ‘Botheration,’ on 2 May 1798. David Erskine Baker credited him with the choruses in Richard Brinsley Sheridan's ‘Pizarro,’ which was produced in 1799. In 1798 he provided two pantomimes, ‘Pyramus and Thisbe’ and the ‘Two Apprentices,’ for the Birmingham theatre.|$|R
