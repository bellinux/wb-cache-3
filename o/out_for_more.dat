5|$|Vicksburg was {{the last}} major Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River; therefore, {{capturing}} it completed {{the second part of}} the Northern strategy, the Anaconda Plan. When two major assaults (May 19 and 22, 1863) against the Confederate fortifications were repulsed with heavy casualties, Grant decided to besiege the city beginning on May 25. After holding <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> than forty days, with no reinforcement and supplies nearly gone, the garrison finally surrendered on July 4.|$|E
5|$|After sending Stewie <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> paper, Paul finds several news {{articles}} in an album that imply Wilkes {{is actually a}} serial killer. Just then, the local sheriff (Joe) appears, and is surprised to find Paul there. Before he can help him, however, Stewie blows his legs off with a shotgun. The sheriff then complains that he will now {{have to spend the}} rest of his life in a wheelchair, only to be shot again and killed by Stewie. Paul finally finishes the book and demands Stewie let him go, but Stewie refuses, knowing he could try to turn him/her in to the police and tell them s/he kidnapped him, held him hostage, and fondled him in his sleep, which Paul did not know originally. Paul's ultimate fate is left ambiguous as the story ends with a Magnum, P.I.-style credits roll.|$|E
5|$|Each unit is {{assigned}} a character class, while affects their assigned weapon, strengths and weaknesses, and range {{and speed of}} movement on the battlefield. These classes range from axemen and swordsmen to thieves, to mounted units and magic users such as healers. Some characters, such as main protagonist Leif, have unique classes. Classes also naturally evolve {{during the course of}} the story. Mounted units have the option of dismounting their steeds to fight on-foot. Weapons within a unit's selected character class can be freely swapped <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> powerful versions: when mounted units dismount, they swap spears for axes or swords. Weapon effectiveness is governed by the Weapons Triangle: swords are strong against axes, axes against spears, and spears against swords.|$|E

5|$|In 1804, the Ellesmere company {{offered to}} buy out the Chester Canal for 1,000 of their shares, and to take over debts up to £4,000. The Chester Canal held <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>more,</b> and the {{negotiations}} failed. Three years later, the financial position of the Chester Canal was better, and they began paying off their debts. Finally in 1813, they agreed to amalgamate, and the action was authorised by a further Act of Parliament. The Ellesmere company paid just half of their 1804 offer, and the 500 Ellesmere shares were distributed between the various Chester shareholders. The Ellesmere and Chester Canal Company took over on 1 July 1813. A new section of canal and an iron lock were built at Beeston in 1827, to resolve continual problems with leakage there.|$|E
5|$|The Ottomans met stiff {{resistance}} at Kőszeg. Suleiman {{had hoped}} that the imperial army would come to relieve Kőszeg, affording him {{an opportunity for a}} larger engagement. However, during the Ottoman attacks on Kőszeg, the imperial army still formed up in Regensburg. The Ottomans continued with one attack after another; artillery fire brought down parts of the walls, but brought no surrender. The Ottomans' mines were sapped by countermines. The layout of Kőszeg's walls made mining a feasible strategy, but even though several mines succeeded in blowing holes in the fortifications, the defenders held <b>out.</b> <b>For</b> <b>more</b> than twenty-five days, without any artillery, Captain Nikola Jurišić and his garrison of 700 local Hungarian peasants and a few Croat soldier held out against nineteen full-scale assaults and an incessant bombardment by the Ottomans.|$|E

He was sent off in the 80th minute in a match against Arsenal on 15 March 2008 after kicking Gaël Clichy {{in the face with}} his boot, which resulted in him receiving a three-match ban. Mido was ruled out {{for the remainder of the}} 2007–08 season in April following a hernia operation on a pelvic injury. He made the bench for Middlesbrough's opening Premier League fixture against former club Tottenham and came on as a substitute in the 82nd minute and scored four minutes later after deflecting Didier Digard's shot. The following weekend saw him score against Liverpool at Anfield to put Middlesbrough 1–0 in the lead, but they eventually lost the game 2–1. This was followed up with goals against Yeovil Town in the League Cup and Portsmouth in the league. Mido was again targeted by some Newcastle fans while warming up before Middlesbrough's 0–0 draw, with claims of racist chanting being investigated by The FA. He revealed his anger at The FA's investigation, believing that they would make no difference to any future abuse. Two men were eventually arrested over the chanting and were due to appear at Teesside Magistrates Court.|$|E

25|$|Early Chinese {{migrants}} to Jamaica brought elements of Chinese folk religion with them, most {{exemplified by the}} altar to Guan Yu which they erected in the old CBA building and which remains standing there, even as the CBA moved its headquarters. However, {{with the passage of}} long decades since their ancestors first migrated from China, traditional Chinese religious practises have largely died out among Chinese Jamaicans. Some traditional practises persisted well into the 20th century, most evident at the Chinese Cemetery, where families would go to clean their ancestors' graves during the Qingming Festival in what was often organised as a communal activity by the CBA (referred to in English as Gah San, after the Hakka word 嫁山); however, with the emigration of much of the Chinese Jamaican community to the North American mainland, the public, communal aspect of this grave-cleaning died out, and indeed it was not carried <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> than a decade before attempts by the CBA to revive it in 2004.|$|E

The fight was aired on Showtime, on 15 December 2012, and took place in the LA Sports Arena in California. Khan defeated Molina by TKO in the tenth round and won the WBC Silver light welterweight title. Khan pushed Molina onto the back foot and landed a sharp right hand that cut Molina over the left eye. Khan was stiffened by a right hook in the second before steadying the ship and resuming control of the contest. Molina's cut deteriorating badly and taking plenty of punishment. Referee Jack Reiss suggested his corner pull him {{out at the end of}} the ninth, however Molina was sent <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>more,</b> despite it being abundantly clear that he did not have the tools to do Khan much damage. Khan started to let his hands go more in round 10, after which his corner finally decided it had seen enough. Khan landed 312 of 679 punches thrown (46%), an equal amount of jabs and power shots were landed. Molina was less busier, landing 87 of 335 (26%).|$|E

While he played nearly every game in 1945, he was slow to start; it took seven straight hits over two games in June to keep his batting average over [...]200, and later that month was fined by manager Lou Boudreau for what he considered [...] "indifferent play". On September 9, 1945 Rocco had two singles, two doubles, and two home runs in a doubleheader sweep over New York in front of a crowd of 72,252 at Yankee Stadium, which he considered the highlight of his professional baseball career.

500|$|Paschal was set {{to enter}} the 1926 season as the fourth outfielder, {{for which he was}} sent a new contract. [...] After {{threatening}} to hold <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> money, the Yankees sent him a new contract which he signed on February 17 for an estimated $7,000 ( [...] today). He began the season as a pinch hitter, but injuries quickly took their toll on the Yankees. Paschal started most of July and August, replacing an injured Meusel, who broke a bone in his right foot. Paschal hit an inside-the-park home run in a victory against the Indians on July 9. With the Yankees in a close pennant race in mid-August, Paschal hit a home run in a loss to the Detroit Tigers. Further successes came with a vital pinch-hit double in a win against the Athletics on September 6 and a home run on September 8. The Yankees clinched the pennant on September 15, and Paschal scored the game-winning single. The Yankees faced the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1926 World Series, and Paschal, pinch hitting for Joe Dugan, singled in Lou Gehrig tying the contest at 2–2 in the ninth inning of Game 5. Tony Lazzeri hit a sacrifice fly in the tenth to win the game for the Yankees, but they lost the next two games and the Series.

500|$|Part of the game's {{concept is}} {{a balance between}} puzzle-solving and perception, giving the player the freedom to explore The Witnesss world and {{creating}} a non-linear approach to gameplay. Two of the first puzzles Blow had created involved [...] "clues in objects that populate the world", which led him to recognize he needed to create a world to support these puzzles. This would form a dichotomy between exploration and puzzle solving, which [...] "made a lot of sense" [...] to Blow. Blow created the island as open world, so that players can leave puzzles they are stuck at and work at other ones, as to avoid punishing the player {{for not being able}} to solve a key puzzle, a common issue with other adventure games according to Blow. Blow wanted puzzles to be clearly presented in the open and without any red herrings, an approach he had taken with Braid. Exploration is encouraged through the game's narrative, which are told by audio logs the player can find on the unpopulated island; through these, Blow attempted to create a [...] "feeling of loneliness in a beautiful space" [...] for the player. Because these logs can be found in any order, Blow hopes that each player may have a different perception of the narrative depending on how they have approached the game. Initially, these audio logs were to be more story-driven, but Blow opted later to change these <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> obfuscated and obtuse information, similar to the text elements used in Braid, as to avoid directly relating out the story of the game for the player and let them think about what the narrative means instead. Blow's team designed the narrative that those that solve more of the puzzles will gain more of a concrete understanding of the story.|$|E
