40|$|OBJETIVO: Avaliar e comparar as alterações biomecânicas da córnea por meio do Ocular Response Analyzer® (ORA Reichert <b>Ophtalmics</b> Instruments, Buffalo, New York, USA) antes e após Lasik com Moriá ® Sub Bowman Keratomileusis (SBK) One Use Plus (OUP) em pacientes míopes e hipermetrópes. MÉTODOS: Foram estudados 33 olhos, sendo 19 olhos míopes e 14 olhos hipermetrópes submetidos à cirurgia refrativa com técnica Lasik com flap fino (100 µ) utilizando Moriá SBK OUP. O ORA foi realizado no pré-operatório e 1 mês após a cirurgia para avaliar a biomecânica da córnea. O CH (Corneal Hysteresis), CRF (Corneal Resistance Factor), IOPg (goldmann gold standard, Goldmann {{correlated}} intraocular pressure) a IOPcc (corneal compensated intraocular pressure) e mais 38 variáveis biomecânicas da córnea derivadas do sinal de resposta foram avaliados. O Teste de Kolmogorov-Smirnov foi utilizado para avaliar a distribuição normal. O teste de Wilcoxon foi utilizado para comparar as variáveis antes e após a cirurgia para cada grupo. As diferenças entre as medidas pré e pós-operatórias dos olhos míopes foram comparadas com as diferenças obtidas nos olhos hipermetrópes, utilizando-se o teste de Mann-Whitney. Foi considerado como estatisticamente significante p PURPOSE: To evaluate biomechanical changes {{measured with}} the ORA (Ocular Response Analyzer®; Reichert Ophthalmic Instruments, Buffalo, New York, USA) after Lasik with the Moria One Use Plus and {{to compare the}} biomechanics changes after myopic and hyperopic ablations. METHODS: Fourteeneyes for hyperopia (H) and 19 eyes for myopia (M) were evaluated with the ORA preoperatively and 1 month after Lasik with thin flap (100 microns) using SBK-OUP (Sub-Bowman Keratomileusis - One Use Plus, Moria®). CH (Corneal Hysteresis), CRF (Corneal Resistance Factor), IOPg (gold-standard, Goldmann correlated Intraocular pressure), IOPcc (Corneal compensated Intraocular pressure) and more 38 variables derived from the corneal biomechanical response signal of the ORA were analyzed. The Wilcoxon {{test was used to}} assess differences between the variables before and after surgery for each group and the differences between the pre and postoperative (1 month) myopic eyes were compared with those obtained in hyperopic eyes, using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: There was a significant difference before and after Lasik in myopic and hyperopic eyes in IOPg (Wilcoxon, p < 0. 05), but not in IOPcc. Only myopic eyes showed a significant difference in CH and CRF measurements before and after LASIK, as well as 9 other biomechanical parameters (aspect 1, h 1, dive 1, path 1, p 1 area 1, W 11, H 11, and w 2 path 11; Wilcoxon, p < 0, 05), 8 of these being related to the first sign of flattening. Five parameters related to the sign of the second applanation showed significant variation only in the eyes before and after hyperopic Lasik (aspect 2, h 2, dive 2, mslew 2 and H 21; Wilcoxon, p< 0, 05). There was a difference in both myopic and hyperopic on three parameters related to the applanation signal areas (p 1 area, and p 2 area p 2 area 1; Wilcoxon, p < 0. 05). Differences in IOPg and p 1 area, before and after surgery were significantly higher in myopic eyes than in hyperopic eyes (Mann-Whitey, p < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: There are several significant differences in biomechanical parameters after Lasik with Moria OUP_SBK. Overall, the impact of myopic LASIK on corneal biomechanics is higher than of hyperopic Lasik. The parameters derived from the first sign of the ORA are more affected in myopic LASIK, whereas parameters derived from the second applanation are more affected in hyperopic LASIK...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The dry eye sindrome {{refers to}} a group of {{disorders}} of the tear film due to reduced tear production or excessive tear evaporation that is associated with symptoms of ocular discomfort and may cause disease of the ocular surface. Dry eye syndrome varies in severity, duration and etiology. The cornerstone of dry eye syndrome therapies includes the intraocular gel or ophthalmic solutions instillation, reaching correct artificial lubrication. Molecules that can produce a stable lubricating film are the carbomers. METHODS: In the first step of our work we reviewed the data from literature reporting about carbomers’ characteristics in respect to other lacrimal substitutes. Then, a pharmacoeconomical analysis has been performed on <b>ophtalmic</b> gels derived from carbomers 974 P and PVA.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The walk is {{strictly}} influenced by vision, that's {{essential for the}} position of the body in the space during the walk cycle and the postural control. The quality of life related to the vision is widely highlighted in literature: for example Brown et al. in 2005 underlined the comparison from DMLE and chronic ills, like HIV, angina, dialysis, advanced prostate tumor, stroke, and heart attack. Peripheral low vision appeared the most crippling aspect to the walk, but in recent years a lot of studies stressed the walk difficulty in patients with central low vision. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study has been carried out in partnership between <b>Ophtalmic</b> Department and Physiatrist Department. Its aim was to evaluate static posture in patients affected by maculopathy. We picked out subjects affected by maculopathy with central low vision due to a variety of causes but with preserved peripheral vision.

40|$|In a {{foregoing}} {{paper we}} have shown the presence in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae of an enzyme catalyzing the hydrolysis of L-γ-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide, but apparently distinct from γ-glutamyltranspeptidase. The cellular level of this enzyme was not regulated {{by the nature of}} the nitrogen source supplied to the yeast cell. Purification was attempted, using ion exchange chromatography on DEAE Sephadex A 50, salt precipitations and successive chromatographies on DEAE Sephadex 6 B and Sephadex G 100. The apparent molecular weight of the purified enzyme was 14, 800 as determined by gel filtration. As shown by kinetic studies and thin layer chromatography, the enzyme preparation exhibited only hydrolytic activity against γ-glutamylarylamide and L-glutamine with an optimal pH of about seven. Various γ-glutamylaminoacids, amides, dipeptides and glutathione were inactive as substrates and no transferase activity was detected. The yeast γ-glutamylarylamidase was activated by SH protective agents, dithiothreitol and reduced glutathione. Oxidized glutathione, <b>ophtalmic</b> acid and various γ-glutamylaminoacids inhibited competitively the enzyme. The activity was also inhibited by L-γ-glutamyl-o-) carboxy) phenylhydrazide and the couple serine-borate, both transition-state analogs of γ-glutamyltranspeptidase. Diazooxonorleucine, reactive analog of glutamine, inactivated the enzyme. The physiological role of yeast γ-glutamylarylamidase-glutaminase is still undefined but is most probably unrelated to the bulk assimilation of glutamine by yeast cells. © 1985 Masson, Paris.

40|$|Abstract. After {{more than}} three centuries, Molyneux’s {{question}} continues to challenge our understanding of cognition and perceptual systems. Locke, the original recipient of the question, approached it as a theoretical exercise relevant to long-standing philosophical issues, such as nativism, the possibility of common sensibles, and the empiricism-rationalism debate. However, philosophers were quick to adopt the experimentalist’s stance {{as soon as they}} became aware of recoveries from congenital blindness through <b>ophtalmic</b> surgery. Such recoveries were widely reported to support empiricist positions, suggesting that the question had found its empirical answer. Contrary to this common view, we argue that studies of patients recovering from early blindness through surgery cannot provide an answer. In fact, because of the very nature of such ophtalmological interventions it is impossible to test the question in the empirical conditions outlined by Molyneux. Thus we propose that Molyneux’s question be treated as an early thought experiment of a specific kind. Although thought experiments of this kind cannot be turned into actual experimental conditions, they provide a conceptual restructuring of theories. Such restructuring in turn leads to new predictions that can then be tested by “normal ” experiments. In accord with this interpretation, we show that Molyneux’s question can be analyzed into a hierarchy of specific questions about vision in its phenomenal and sensory-motor components. Some of these questions do lead to actual experimental conditions that could be studied empirically...|$|E

Conclusion: SBS is characterized by severe long-term sequelae both in visual and cognitive function. Several visual impairments are observed, mainly related to cortial injury of visuo-spatial area. Although follow-up is difficult due to family history, there is strong indication for global assessment until scholar age where other impairments are demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Background: A recent {{multicentre}} RCT {{has shown}} that supraorbital transcutaneous stimulation (STS) targeting branches of the <b>ophtalmic</b> nerve with the Cefaly® device is effective as a preventive therapy for migraine (Schoenen et al., Neurology 2013). However, the mechanisms of action in {{the central nervous system}} remain unknown. Here, we conducted voxel-based analyses of [18]FDG-PET to evaluate metabolic changes immediately after the first STS session and after 3 months of treatment in patients with migraine. Methods: Twenty-eight subjects participated in the experiment: 14 patients with episodic migraine (ICHD 3 beta criteria) and 14 age-matched controls. Healthy volunteers underwent only one [18]FDG-PET scan whereas patients were scanned at baseline, directly after a first session of STS and after 3 months of daily treatment. Results: Compliant patients showed a significant {{decrease in the number of}} attacks (p = 0. 03). When compared to controls, patients (n = 14) at baseline were hypometabolic in the fronto-temporal regions (p < 0. 001), especially in the orbitofrontal (OFC) and perigenual anterior cingulate cortex. OFC hypometabolism was not correlated with medication intake. In compliant patients, daily STS for 3 months was followed by a normalization of the fronto-temporal hypometabolism (p< 0. 001; OFC: pFWE< 0. 01). Conclusion: Our study suggests that the OFC is hypoactive in episodic migraine. STS with the Cefaly° device is able to normalize this hypoactivity. This indicates that STS exerts its beneficial effect via slow neuromodulatory mechanisms, as also previously shown for percutaneous occipital nerve stimulation in refractory cluster headache (Magis et al., BMC Neurology 2011).

40|$|Background. Orbit is {{involved}} in 40 % of all facial fractures. There is considerable variety in severity, ranging from simple nondisplaced to complex comminuted fractures. Complex comminuted fractures (up to 20 %) {{are responsible for the}} majority of complications and unfavorable results. Orbital fractures are classified as internal orbital fractures, zygomatico-orbital fractures, naso-orbito-ethmoidal fractures and combined fractures. The <b>ophtalmic</b> sequelae of midfacial fractures are usually edema and ecchymosis of the soft tissues, subconjuctival hemorrhage, diplopia, iritis, retinal edema, ptosis, enophthalmos, ocular muscle paresis, mechanical restriction of ocular movement and nasolacrimal disturbances. More severe injuries such as optic nerve trauma and retinal detachments have also been reported. Within the wide range of orbital fractures small group of complex fractures causes most of the sequelae. Therefore identification of severe injuries and adequate treatment is of major importance. The introduction of craniofacial techniques made possible a wide exposure even of large orbital wall defects and their reconstruction by bone grafts. In spite of significant progress, repair of complex orbital wall defects remains a problem even for the experienced surgeons. Results. In 1999 121 facial injuries were treated at our department (Clinical Centre Ljubljana Dept. Of Maxillofacial and Oral Surgery). Orbit was involved in 65 % of cases. Isolated inner orbital fractures presented 4 % of all fractures. 17 (14 %) complex cases were treated, 5 of them being NOE, 5 orbital (frame and inner walls), 3 zygomatico-orbital, 2 FNO and 2 maxillo-orbital fractures. Conclusions. Final result of the surgical treatment depends on severity of maxillofacial trauma. Complex comminuted fractures are responsable for most of the unfavorable results and ocular function is often permanently damaged (up to 75 %) in these fractures. </p...|$|E
40|$|P 2 purinoceptors {{are divided}} into two families, ionotropic receptors (P 2 X) and metabotropic receptors (P 2 Y). P 2 X receptors (seven types; P 2 X 1 - 7) contain {{intrinsic}} pores that open by binding with ATP, and P 2 Y receptors (eight types; P 2 Y 1, 2, 4, 6, 11 - 14) are activated by nucleotides and couple to intracellular second-messenger systems through heterotrimeric G-proteins. The P 2 Y 1 and P 2 Y 2 receptors are expressed in most human tissues including the heart, placenta, vascular endothelia, prostate, ovary, platelets and brain. They are attractive pharmaceutical targets due to their involvement in the modulation of various functions in many tissues and organs under both normal and pathophysiological conditions. P 2 Y 1 agonists may have potential as antihypertensive or antidiabetic agent. P 2 Y 2 receptor is a target in therapeutics of pulmonary diseases such as cystic fibrosis, and <b>ophtalmic</b> diseases. P 2 Y 1 receptor is activated by ADP, while P 2 Y 2 is activated equipotently by both ATP and UTP (1). Recently, we have synthesized the 2 ’- and 3 ’-C-methyl derivatives of ADP and evaluated their capacity to promote hP 2 Y 1 and hP 2 Y 2 receptor-mediated activation of PLC at recombinant human receptors expressed in atrocytoma cells. From the functional assay 2 ’-C-methyl-ADP resulted a full agonist at P 2 Y 1 receptor, while 3 ’-Cmethyl- ADP acted as partial agonist at P 2 Y 2 receptor. Having a nucleotide scaffold, these compounds suffer from limitations due their chemical and metabolic instability. One of the approaches to overcome the inherent instability of nucleotide-based drug candidates {{include the use of}} isoster-based non-hydrolyzable nucleotides. Based on these considerations, the (methylene) bisphosphonate derivatives of 2 ’-Cmethyl-, and 3 ’-C-methyl-adenosine were synthesized and evaluated for their capacity to promote hP 2 Y 1 and hP 2 Y 2 receptor-mediated activation of PLC at recombinant human receptors expressed in astrocytoma cells. The results of the functional assay will be discussed...|$|E
