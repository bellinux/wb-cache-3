25|$|This {{pattern in}} turn {{suggests}} the following method of creating models of iterations of the Heighway dragon curve by folding {{a strip of}} paper. Take a strip of paper and fold it in half to the right. Fold it in half again to the right. If the strip was opened <b>out</b> <b>now,</b> unbending each fold to become a 90 degree turn, the turn sequence would be RRL i.e. the second iteration of the Heighway dragon. Fold the strip in half again to the right, and the turn sequence of the unfolded strip is now RRLRRLL – the third iteration of the Heighway dragon. Continuing folding the strip in half {{to the right to}} create further iterations of the Heighway dragon (in practice, the strip becomes too thick to fold sharply after four or five iterations).|$|E
25|$|Those who are {{suffering}} most keenly, and who have lost most, either of their children by death or their possessions by fire and sword, such as those reconcentrated women in the camps, have the most conspicuous patience, and never express a wish that their men should {{be the ones to}} give way. It must be fought <b>out</b> <b>now,</b> they think, to the bitter end. It is a very costly business upon which England has embarked, and even at such a cost hardly the barest necessities can be provided, and no comforts. It is so strange to think that every tent contains a family, and every family is in trouble–loss behind, poverty in front, sickness, privation and death in the present. But they are very good, and say they have agreed to be cheerful and {{make the best of it}} all. The Mafeking camp folk were very surprised to hear that English women cared a rap about them or their suffering. It has done them a lot of good to hear that real sympathy is felt for them at home, and so I am glad I fought my way here, if only for that reason.|$|E

"Bounce" [...] {{was first}} {{released}} as a digital extended play (EP)—which included a remix by DJ Green Lantern—on 27 May 2013 in selected {{countries such as}} France, while the release in several other countries were postponed to a later date. The delays prompted Azalea's fans to campaign an earlier release of the single; in a press release, Azalea explained: [...] "The problem with kids– and I {{was one of these}} people too– is that they think they work in the industry and know how it all works. They're like, 'put 'Bounce' <b>out</b> <b>now</b> or it's gonna flop!'. I'm like, 'I need to promote it first or it's gonna flop!'. It's coming out on July 8 and I need fans to trust their fave on this one because it's for the best. I need to hashtag that– #trustyourfaves."

Dewa cancelled that last order and turned south around 20:00 in pursuit of several Russian cruisers that were fleeing to the south, {{in an attempt to}} intercept them before they reached the isolated flotillas of destroyers and torpedo boats. The Russian ships were engaged by other Japanese cruisers before they could reach the small ships, and Dewa broke off the pursuit around 20:25 as light was fading.

Cooper stated: [...] "The audience – both young and old – relate to the Kay/Jill relationship". Walton describes their relationship as [...] "incredible" [...] and said: [...] "The love and the hate is so mixed, and there is never any telling when it will bubble <b>out</b> <b>now.</b> [...] It used to be, “This month I like her... this month I hate her.” [...] Now, it’s more from moment to moment." ...|$|E

[...] Reginald Dennis, former music editor of the magazine and XXL co-founder, later recounted, [...] "Awarding records 5 mics – classic status – has always been, on some levels, troubling to me.

[...] Dennis cited it as [...] "the only time I ever broke the 'no 5' rule" [...] and added, [...] "I told Jon that we'd work all of that stuff out {{when it was time to}} review the album. But everyday, Jon was like, 'yo, this album is 5 mics — seriously, Reg, 5 mics!' ...|$|E

Angela Wilson of Vibe described the track as [...] "a celebratory salute to self love" [...] and highlighted the lines [...] "And I won’t wait any longer / When you let me down, I got stronger," [...] as empowering. Will Hodgkinson of The Times thought that [...] "Thunder" [...] was about her former record label boss and friend Simon Cowell, writing that the lyrics [...] "I won’t wait any longer, when you let me down I got stronger," [...] was Lewis' way of saying [...] "Check me <b>out</b> <b>now,</b> you high-waisted berk."

Marseille's flight was vectored onto Allied aircraft in the vicinity but the opponent withdrew and did not take up combat. Marseille vectored the heading and height of the formation to Neumann who directed III./JG 27 to engage. Marseille heard 8./JG 27 leader Werner Schröer claim a Spitfire over the radio at 10:30. While returning to base, his new Messerschmitt Bf 109G-2/trop's cockpit began to fill with smoke; blinded and half asphyxiated, he was guided back to German lines by his wingmen, Jost Schlang and Lt Rainer Pöttgen. Upon reaching friendly lines, [...] "Yellow 14" [...] had lost power and was drifting lower and lower. Pöttgen called out after about 10 minutes that they had reached the White Mosque of Sidi Abdel Rahman, and were thus within friendly lines.
