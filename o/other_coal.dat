5|$|Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino (STT) of Trieste was {{selected}} for the contract to build eight vessels, ahead of one other tenderer. Despite the specifications of the contract being {{very close to the}} requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the STT boats were classified as sea-going. The STT boats used Parsons turbines driving two propeller shafts. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when Ganz & Danubius reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them. These boats were powered by AEG-Curtiss turbines, and had two funnels rather than the single funnel of the STT boats. The third contract went to Cantiere Navale Triestino (CNT), who used Melms-Pfenniger turbines, and their boats also had two funnels. The boats of all three groups used steam generated by two Yarrow water-tube boilers, one of which burned fuel oil and the <b>other</b> <b>coal.</b>|$|E
40|$|Advanced {{analytical}} {{techniques were}} performed on four South African coals, three noncoking and one coking, containing different maceral contributions (vitrinite contents ranging between 24 and 66 vol %, m. m. f. b.). Inertinite-rich (INY, UMZ) and vitrinite-rich (G# 5 and TSH) coals were investigated to quantify differences and similarities in structural properties. Coals from the Witbank region (INY, UMZ, and G# 5) have similar carbon contents (79. 2 − 83. 8 wt % d. a. f.), {{in contrast to a}} carbon content of 90. 8 wt % (d. a. b.) for coal TSH. The free swelling index (FSI) indicated that the Witbank coals were noncoking while TSH was strongly coking. Solid state nuclear magnetic resonance indicated that the vitrinite-rich (65. 9 vol % m. m. f. b.), higher rank (1. 23 RoV %) coal TSH was more aromatic (81 %) and more polycondensed than the <b>other</b> three <b>coals.</b> Coal G# 5 was the least aromatic (66 %) and was characterized by its larger proportion of protonated aliphatics as compared to the <b>other</b> <b>coals.</b> Coals UMZ, INY, and G# 5 had similar average aromatic cluster sizes (ranging between 19 and 21 aromatic carbons) and number of cluster attachments (5 to 6) as estimated from NMR data. Furthermore, the cluster attachments of coal TSH were concentrated more in the side-chains, whereas the attachments of the <b>other</b> three <b>coals</b> were more prominent in bridge-and/or loop structures. XRD carbon crystallite analyses showed that coal G# 5 contained the largest amount of amorphous carbon (67 %), consistent with a higher volatile matter yield in comparison to the <b>other</b> <b>coals.</b> Laser-desorption ionization mass time-of-flight spectroscopy indicated that all four coals displayed similar molecular weight distributions ranging up to 1800 m/z. Coal TSH showed a maximum abundance at a higher molecular mass (608 m/z) in comparison to the <b>other</b> three <b>coals.</b> HRTEM analyses confirmed the presence of slightly more aromatic fringes in the higher molecular mass range for coal TSH in comparison to the <b>other</b> <b>coals.</b> [URL]...|$|R

25|$|Rapid City's {{location}} on the boundary of the Western and Eastern power grids, together with the hydroelectric plants of the Mainstem Dams on the Missouri River and the large coal fields and power plants of the Powder River Basin of Wyoming make {{it one of the}} points where the two national power grids connect with each other, allowing switching of electrical power from east to west and vice versa. Rapid City previously had its own coal-fired power plant before Federal regulations forced it and many <b>other</b> <b>coal</b> plants in the area such as power stations near Gillette, Wyoming, to shut down. The Ben French power station located within city boundaries shut down September 2012, more than 2 years ahead of its scheduled shut down. Rapid City now obtains much of its power from both the Missouri dams and importing it from elsewhere. Electrical rates used to be considered relatively low until the shut down of the coal plants, so have progressively climbed the last several years as a lack of local power sources means massive expenses to import it from greater distances.|$|E

25|$|High grade coal was {{discovered}} by a hunter on Sharp Mountain in 1791 above the steep sided valleys surrounding Tamaqua, but the news quickly lead to other discoveries such as on at the minor peak called Summit Hill on Pisgah Mountain six miles due east of Tamaqua and as {{much closer to the}} ship-navigable Delaware watershedfrom Summit Hill, the rapids plagued Lehigh River and the higher capacity of boats was but just over a ridge and a half days haul by mules away. Both mineral-finds lead directly to rapid coal mining development of the area, which began first commercially by a joint stock company, the Lehigh Coal Mining Company (LCMC) at Summit Hill in 1792. Shortly after <b>other</b> <b>coal</b> mining ventures also began up the Susquehanna in a third watershed, the Wyoming Valley west of the Poconos and also to west of Tamaqua, Pennsylvania in the Schuylkill Valley as well as closer to Harrisburg down the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians. Given the fundamental need of fuels, it is little wonder the financiers of the day were willing investors ready to back projects which promised to get supplies to new markets. The gorge became historic and not just scenic when such investors came together to continue the English model, canals between major cities of source and supply, if necessary carried across viaducts above streams to provide cheap bulk materials transfers. By the early 1820s, the new management of the Lehigh Coal Mining Company would show the way and the LCMC would disappear as a subsidiary corporation and became a key element in one of the nation's first vertical mergers.|$|E
