The laser data from laser range sensors and visual data from the cameras {{can be used for}} detection, monitoring and identification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obstacles.</b> The detection and monitoring are better in the two-dimensional laser data, while identification is easier in the images from the cameras; the two methods are complementary. Information from laser data can be used to delimit work areas in the image.|$|E
5|$|Then, {{following}} {{a degree of}} reconciliation with Charles, Rupert obtained command of the Royalist fleet himself. The intention was to restore Royalist finances by using the remaining vessels of the fleet to conduct a campaign of organised piracy against English shipping across the region. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obstacles</b> that this plan faced was the growing strength of the Parliamentary fleet {{and the presence of}} Robert Blake, one of the finest admirals of the period, as Rupert's opponent during the campaign.|$|E
25|$|Show jumping {{comprises}} a timed event {{judged on}} the ability of the horse and rider to jump over a series of obstacles, in a given order and with the fewest refusals or knockdowns of portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obstacles.</b>|$|E
30|$|To achieve <b>the</b> {{objectives}} <b>of</b> {{this investigation}} and study <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> frequency of updates, aspect ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obstacle,</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obstacle,</b> and <b>the</b> distance between injection wells and <b>the</b> <b>obstacle,</b> on <b>the</b> sweep efficiency upstream <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> various sensitivity analyses were conducted. In these studies, the various parameters were changed by a preset factor and {{their effect on}} the production optimization is reported in terms of percent sweep enhancement in <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> interest (i.e., upstream <b>of</b> <b>the</b> non-permeable <b>obstacle).</b>|$|R
30|$|Upstream <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obstacle,</b> <b>the</b> bulk {{velocity}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electrons {{is nearly}} the same as <b>the</b> convection velocity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solar wind.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation is}} made to study <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>obstacle</b> on <b>the</b> flow structure <b>of</b> air-water two-phase flow through a rectangular enlarging channel. <b>The</b> cross-section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> is considered as circular in shape. Effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> on <b>the</b> flow structure, pressure fluctuation and pressure distribution is made. Finite volume method (FVM) with mixture model and Eulerian model have been adopted for the present numerical simulation. Simulation results are obtained for both steady and unsteady cases. Due to change in both magnitude and direction of local velocities <b>of</b> fluid as <b>the</b> mixture approaches <b>the</b> <b>obstacle,</b> there is a marked difference in phase distribution around <b>the</b> <b>obstacle.</b> As <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> increases, this becomes more remarkable. It can also be noticed that vortices before and after <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> becomes stronger with increase in size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obstacle.</b> <b>The</b> pressure difference is also monitored. It is found that as <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> size increases, <b>the</b> pressure drop increases and pressure distribution changes drastically...|$|R
25|$|Also in August, Swedish {{chancellor}} Axel Oxenstierna came to Stralsund, {{and offered}} negotiations to Wallenstein. The latter however refused.

25|$|Forestry is an {{important}} economic resource for Papua New Guinea but the industry uses low and semi-intensive technological inputs. As a result, product ranges are limited to sawed timber, veneer, plywood, block board, moulding, poles and posts and wood chips. Only a few limited finished products are exported. Lack of automated machinery, coupled with inadequately trained local technical personnel, are some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obstacles</b> to introducing automated machinery and design. Policy-makers need to {{turn their attention to}} eliminating these barriers, in order for forestry to make a more efficient and sustainable contribution to national economic development.|$|E
25|$|As {{commonly}} argued by Dewey’s greatest critics, he was {{not able}} to come up with strategies in order to fulfill his ideas that would lead to a successful democracy, educational system, and a successful women’s suffrage movement. While knowing that traditional beliefs, customs, and practices needed to be examined in order to find out what worked and what needed improved upon, it was never done in a systematic way. “Dewey became increasingly aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obstacles</b> presented by entrenched power and alert to the intricacy of the problems facing modern cultures”. With the complex of society at the time, Dewey was criticized for his lack of effort in fixing the problems.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the {{simultaneous}} operation of Mirabel (international flights) and Dorval (continental flights) (see below) made Montreal less attractive to international airlines. A European passenger {{who wanted to}} travel to another destination in Canada or fly to the United States had to take an hour-long bus ride from Mirabel to Dorval. The complicated transfer process put Montreal at a significant disadvantage. The planned but unbuilt highways and incomplete train routes compounded the problem. The international airlines responded by shifting their routes to Toronto. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obstacles</b> of the planned transfer from Dorval to Mirabel was Air Canada's desire to keep flights in Dorval (and its proximity with AVEOS workshops) and the connections in Pearson Airport.|$|E

40|$|We explore <b>the</b> {{classical}} problem <b>of</b> {{lee wave}} generation by a stationary isolated three- dimensional obstacle {{in a uniform}} low-Froude-number stratified flow.

As seen by previous authors, we find that the uniform flow can be divided into two regions: an essentially two-dimensional flow around <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> and a wave-generating flow over <b>the</b> top portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obstacle.</b> We show that quantitative agreement between experimental observations and predictions of linear wave theory is only possible if we take into account a small slope across <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface separating the quasi-two- dimensional flow around <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> and <b>the</b> wave-generating flow over <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obstacle...</b>|$|R
25|$|But if Tilney's {{censorship}} {{restricted the}} writers, his support protected them from generally hostile civic authorities. The polite fiction of aristocratic patronage did not obscure {{the reality that}} the troupes were commercial enterprises; however, that fiction brought the theatres under royal protection; in 1592, the Lord Mayor of London named Tilney as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obstacles</b> to ending public drama in the city. However, Tilney's censorship was not of a generalising nature. While he did omit politically volatile passages and scenes, some, like the deposition scene in Richard II and the murder of Julius Caesar, were allowed to remain. However, {{there is no way}} of knowing whether Julius Caesar was allowed to be performed uncensored. Shakespeare's plays seemed to have suffered the severest form of censorship under Tilney.|$|E
25|$|Both centers vigorously {{pursued the}} {{promotion}} of Ashkharhabar. The proliferation of newspapers in both versions (Eastern & Western) {{and the development of}} a network of schools where modern Armenian was taught, dramatically increased the rate of literacy (in spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obstacles</b> by the colonial administrators), even in remote rural areas. The emergence of literary works entirely written in the modern versions increasingly legitimized the language’s existence. By the turn of the 20th century both varieties of the one modern Armenian language prevailed over Grabar and opened the path to a new and simplified grammatical structure of the language in the two different cultural spheres. Apart from several morphological, phonetic, and grammatical differences, the largely common vocabulary and generally analogous rules of grammatical fundamentals allows users of one variant to understand the other as long as they are fluent in one of the literary standards.|$|E
500|$|An aerial robot from Germany's Technische Universität Berlin {{was able}} to detect and avoid all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obstacles</b> (many of which could have {{destroyed}} the robot itself), identify all the dead {{on the ground and}} the survivors (distinguishing between the two based on movement), and relay pictures of the survivors along with their locations back to first responders who would attempt a rescue.

50|$|In fluid dynamics, an eddy is <b>the</b> {{swirling}} <b>of</b> a {{fluid and}} the reverse current created when the fluid is in a turbulent flow regime.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with <b>the</b> scattering problem <b>of</b> time-harmonic acoustic plane waves by an impenetrable obstacle buried in a piecewise homogeneous medium. The so-called generalized impedance boundary condition is imposed on <b>the</b> boundary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obstacle.</b> Firstly, <b>the</b> well posedness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solution to the direct scattering problem is established by using the boundary integral method. Then a uniqueness result for the inverse scattering problem is proved; that is, both <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obstacle’s</b> shape and <b>the</b> impedances (μ, λ) can be uniquely determined from far field measurements. Furthermore, a mathematical basis is given to reconstruct <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> by using a modified linear sampling method...|$|R
50|$|When a gravity current {{encounters}} a solid boundary, it can either overcome the boundary, by flowing around or over it, or be reflected by it. <b>The</b> actual outcome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collision depends {{primarily on the}} height and width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obstacle.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> is shallow (part) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gravity current will overcome <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> by flowing over it. Similarly, if <b>the</b> width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> is small, <b>the</b> gravity current will flow around it, just like a river flows around a boulder.|$|R
