5|$|Lewis Hamilton did {{go out on}} {{the softer}} tyres in Q2, setting the fastest time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session,</b> the first to lap in under 1 minute, 20 seconds. Behind him Vettel was second ahead of Rosberg. Räikkönen went out on the harder {{compound}} tyre, but aborted his running after spinning in turn one, leaving him fifteenth fastest with a grid penalty for his gearbox change yet to come. Max Verstappen put in a fast lap towards the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session,</b> demoting his teammate Sainz, Jr. out of the top ten. Also eliminated were both Lotus and the second Sauber of Ericsson.|$|E
5|$|Ferrari {{dominated}} both {{practice sessions}} on the Friday, with Räikkönen fastest {{in the first}} Practice Session and Felipe Massa was fastest in the second Practice Session. Behind the Ferraris, Alonso was third in his McLaren, but seven tenths behind, with his teammate and World Championship leader Lewis Hamilton sixth, but lost nearly an hour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session</b> due to car trouble. The two McLarens were split by David Coulthard and Nico Rosberg.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{was again}} fastest {{in the second}} session on Friday afternoon, edging out Rosberg by almost seven-tenths of a second. Rosberg's running was limited as he coasted to a halt on track with twenty minutes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session</b> left to go due to losing drive. Ferrari was not {{competitive}} in eighth and thirteenth place for Vettel and Räikkönen respectively, with both cars suffering from problems with their energy recovery unit. The top five cars were powered by Mercedes, as Sergio Pérez led the charge behind Mercedes in third, ahead of Bottas and Nico Hülkenberg. Fernando Alonso managed eleventh place, but had to spend considerable time in the garage while his team worked on his car. Marcus Ericsson also had limited track time as a problem with his exhaust pipe forced him to miss the early part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session.</b> With loose kerbs detected during the GP2 qualifying session, drivers were instructed to stay clear of the kerbs at turn 6. Once more, many drivers had minor incidents on track, with some having {{to take to the}} run-off area at turn 3, while Gutiérrez touched the barrier at turn 8. Carlos Sainz Jr. spun at the first corner, but nevertheless finished the session in sixth, the fastest runner without a Mercedes power unit.|$|E
5|$|In Q2, lap times {{improved}} {{and the two}} Mercedes drivers led the way, with Rosberg {{a little over a}} tenth of a second ahead of teammate Hamilton. Fernando Alonso went faster than Valtteri Bottas and looked to make it into Q3, when Max Verstappen went faster and eliminated the McLaren driver. Also not in the top ten were both Lotus and the second McLaren of Jenson Button. Conditions soon worsened, preventing faster lap times. Many drivers spun out in the latter part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session,</b> complaining about aquaplaning.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} {{practice}} session on Saturday morning, Hamilton managed to beat Ferrari, with the Englishman ahead of second-placed Massa by 0.063 seconds. Hamilton {{and the two}} Ferraris completed the top three, but Alonso was again down in eighth, having missed nearly the whole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session</b> with a faulty brake sensor. The Renaults sparked a return to form with Heikki Kovalainen and Giancarlo Fisichella fourth and fifth, both ahead of rivals BMW, who were sixth and fifteenth respectively.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} session of Friday afternoon, Nico Rosberg topped the timesheets, setting a time of 1m41.983s, {{finishing}} more than {{a tenth of a}} second ahead of Hamilton. Third fastest was Sergio Pérez for Force India, although he was unable to run in the last twenty minutes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session</b> due to brake issues. The Red Bull drivers Kvyat and Ricciardo were fourth and sixth respectively, while Fernando Alonso came within one second of Rosberg's time in ninth.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton {{topped the}} time sheets in Saturday's free {{practice}} session, with Sebastian Vettel {{a tenth of}} a second behind, while Rosberg and Räikkönen completed the top four. Few cars took to the track during the early part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session</b> due to high temperatures and strong winds. A brief red flag period occurred midway through practice when Daniil Kvyat spun out in turn four.|$|E

5|$|Lewis Hamilton {{topped the}} {{timesheets}} in second practice on Friday afternoon {{with a time}} of 1:37.583, using the super-soft compound. Earlier in the session, he had suffered a spin in turn four that flat-spotted his tyres and sent him back to the pitlane. Rosberg managed only third fastest as the Mercedes drivers were split by Sebastian Vettel, even though the latter suffered from electrical problems that lost him track time. Rosberg in turn was unable to improve on his time set on the soft-compound tyre due to his super-soft run being compromised by yellow flags shown after a spin by Romain Grosjean. Behind the top three, Kimi Räikkönen was again fourth, ahead of Daniel Ricciardo and Valtteri Bottas. Slowest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session</b> was Sauber's Marcus Ericsson, with the two Manor drivers Rio Haryanto and Pascal Wehrlein slotting in ahead of him. Wehrlein reported a loss of power after crossing the chequered flag at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session.</b>|$|E
5|$|One 45-minute {{practice}} session {{was held on}} Friday before the two races. King was fastest {{with a time of}} 1:42.441, ten-hundredths of a second faster than teammate Alexander Rossi in second. Alex Lynn was third-fastest, ahead of Stoffel Vandoorne. Arthur Pic and Rio Haryanto were fifth and sixth. Gasly was seventh-fastest, Evans eighth, Raffaele Marciello ninth, and Matsushita completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Vandoorne's run ended prematurely with seven minutes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session</b> remaining when his car stopped due to an oil pressure failure.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. Before qualifying began on Saturday afternoon, Mercedes was forced to change the power unit in Nico Rosberg's car back to the one used in Belgium, which had already run for six full races, after finding an issue with the new specification unit. Meanwhile, Lotus was forced to borrow tyre blankets from other teams, as their own had been rendered unusable by rain during the night. When the session began, Nico Hülkenberg {{was one of the first}} out on track, but his fast lap was disrupted by Marcus Ericsson, who was later penalised for the incident. Both Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen spent most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session</b> in the pit lane. While Ricciardo was able to get out and set a lap sufficient to see him proceed to the second part of qualifying (Q2), Verstappen went out only to see his engine cover blown off at Curva Grande, scattering the track with debris, though at the very end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session,</b> so no other cars were affected. Next to Verstappen, both Manor Marussia and McLaren drivers were eliminated.|$|E

5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with six drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. Following his crash in free practice, Rosberg's car needed to be repaired and he did not get out on track {{in the first part of}} qualifying (Q1) until nine minutes before the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session.</b> He nevertheless managed to set the fastest time, more than four-tenths of a second ahead of Hamilton. Pascal Wehrlein performed well for Manor, setting the tenth fastest time, just over a second off of Rosberg's time. Just as in free practice, suspension failures occurred: First it was Sergio Pérez who nursed his car back to the pit lane. Towards the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session,</b> Daniil Kvyat crashed heavily following a break in his suspension in turn 7. Qualifying was red flagged as a consequence and later restarted with 1:44 minutes remaining. Nico Hülkenberg was the only driver to improve on his time, while others were prevented from improvement by Carlos Sainz Jr., who was stranded with his car off the track, causing yellow flags to be shown. Eventually, the two Sauber drivers were last, behind Kvyat and Rio Haryanto, with the two Renault cars the last to be eliminated.|$|E

5|$|The {{practice}} session on Saturday was run without spectators {{to ensure their}} safety. On track, Lewis Hamilton was fastest, ahead of his closest championship rival Sebastian Vettel. With conditions worsening over the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session,</b> Vettel spun out twice. Max Verstappen ended the session last, while Force India's Nico Hülkenberg was third, ahead of Valtteri Bottas and Sainz.|$|E
5|$|The second {{practice}} session {{was held in}} wet but drying weather conditions. During the session, Schumacher went off the track at the exit of turnfive, damaging his car's front wing in the process. However, he still set the fastest time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session</b> (1:23.607) after a change to his car's ride height proved beneficial to its performance. The top six was completed by Berger, Hill, Häkkinen, Alesi, and Olivier Panis' Ligier.|$|E
5|$|The top ten contested {{the third}} part of qualifying. Romain Grosjean was unable to post a lap time after having problem with his {{brake-by-wire}} system. At the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session,</b> both Mercedes drivers set two fast laps. After the first time around, Rosberg was ahead of Hamilton, but the World Champion improved on his second lap, being two-tenths of a second faster than his teammate. During their final flying laps at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session,</b> both drivers spun on {{different parts of the}} track, Hamilton in turn one and Rosberg in the final corner, meaning the order remained, with Hamilton taking the 45th pole position of his career, drawing level with Sebastian Vettel, who qualified third. Last year's pole sitter Felipe Massa followed in fourth, while Le Mans winner Nico Hülkenberg finished fifth, ahead of the second Williams of Valtteri Bottas.|$|E
