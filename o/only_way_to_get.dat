5|$|At present, {{there are}} two ways to get to Arad: by air or road. The only highway {{connecting}} Arad with the rest of the country is Highway 31, which connects it with Beersheba to the west, and the Dead Sea to the east. It has two junctions within Arad's municipal area—the Arad Junction (within the city itself, with Road 3199), and the Tel Arad Junction (with Highway 80). The local Road 3199 connects Arad with Masada, but does not connect to the road next to the dead sea (Highway 90). It is therefore the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to Masada's western side.|$|E
5|$|Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez, , is a {{decision}} of the Supreme Court of the United States concerning the constitutionality of funding restrictions imposed by the United States Congress. At issue were restrictions on the Legal Services Corporation (LSC), a private, non-profit corporation established by Congress. The restrictions prohibited LSC attorneys from representing clients attempting to amend (or challenge) existing welfare law. The case was brought by Carmen Velazquez, whose LSC-funded attorneys sought to challenge existing welfare provisions, believing it was the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Velazquez financial relief.|$|E

The <b>only</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the site were hundreds of miles by boat, or else by small plane. Since {{the construction of the}} Border Highway by the Mexican Government in the early 1980s, it is possible for tourists to visit. To reach the site, it is necessary now only to take an hour-long boat ride down the Usumacinta River from Frontera Corozal.|$|R

5|$|As a result, {{the gods}} and goddesses meet and hold a thing to discuss and debate the matter. At the thing, the god Heimdallr puts forth the {{suggestion}} that, in place of Freyja, Thor should be dressed as the bride, complete with jewels, women's clothing down to his knees, a bridal head-dress, and the necklace Brísingamen. Thor rejects the idea, yet Loki interjects {{that this will be}} the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back Mjöllnir. Loki points out that, without Mjöllnir, the jötnar will be able to invade and settle in Asgard. The gods dress Thor as a bride, and Loki states that he will go with Thor as his maid, and that the two shall drive to Jötunheimr together.|$|E
5|$|In Sorceria, {{the party}} learns {{that this is}} Ashlynn's home. The elders tell Ashlynn that the Demon Lord is {{watching}} her and give her the powerful spell Magic Burst to fight him. The party also learns that the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to the Demon Lord is through Zenith Tower, but to activate the tower, they need to collect the sword, armor, shield, and helmet of legend. While doing so, the Hero meets his double in Real Weaver's Peak, who gets spooked, and speaks 'Y-You. Y-You're m-m-me!', and says that he must prove himself {{to be faithful to}} his family if he is to join powers. Returning to Real Somnia, the King and Queen tell the Hero that he is indeed the prince. When he fused with his clone, the Hero gained his memory back, much like Ashlynn and Carver had done.|$|E
5|$|When Locke {{leaves the}} island to bring the {{survivors}} back to the island, Ben tracks him down. He gets Locke to reveal what he knows about returning to the island, then kills him and stages it as a suicide. Ben visits Jack in the funeral home housing Locke's body, telling Jack he will help him return to the island, but the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back is to bring everyone who had left it, including Locke's corpse. Ben boards Ajira Airways Flight 316 {{with the rest of}} survivors, which then crashes on the island. Jack, Kate, Hurley, and Sayid are transported to 1977, while Sun and Ben remain in 2007 with a resurrected Locke. The plane crash lands on the Hydra Island, so Ben attempts to take a boat to the main island. Sun strikes him {{in the back of the}} head and takes the boat with Frank, so Ben is left in the care of the other survivors, including Locke. After Ben regains consciousness and finds Locke to be alive, he convinces Locke he knew bringing him to the island would resurrect him, and he stopped Locke's suicide attempt merely to gain information. Locke travels with Ben, who is to be judged by the Monster. After they fail to find the Monster at the Barracks, they head to the Temple. As Ben and Locke travel through a series of tunnels beneath the Temple, Ben falls through the floor, so Locke leaves to get something that he can pull him up with. The Monster flows out of a grate below and surrounds Ben, showing flashes of decisions he made in his life involving Alex. The Monster takes the form of Alex and pushes Ben against a wall. She says she knows Ben is planning to kill Locke again, and if he does she will hunt him down and destroy him. She orders him to follow Locke and do whatever he asks, then disappears. They return to the Others' camp, where Locke gathers the group together and announces he is taking them to see Jacob. As they are walking, Ben relates his experience with the Monster and his promise to do whatever Locke asks, so Locke convinces Ben to kill Jacob. Richard leads them to the base of the statue, where Jacob lives. Within, they are met by Jacob (Mark Pellegrino). Jacob greets Locke and observes Locke has found a loophole. It is revealed that Locke was not resurrected, and is instead the Monster taking the form of Locke. Ben confronts Jacob about why he never revealed himself at any time during Ben's tenure as leader, but when Jacob is dismissive towards him, he stabs Jacob twice, killing him - and in doing so, binds his destiny to the island, sealing his own fate.|$|E

25|$|The Americans with Disabilities Act sets certain {{standards}} for building access and other design considerations in all new construction and major renovations in the U.S. An architectural barrier is any feature that makes access {{or use of}} a building difficult, unreasonably dangerous or impossible.

Historically, many deaths and serious injuries have occurred due to fire, inhalation of smoke or noxious fumes, etc., because blocked or partially blocked aisles prevented persons from promptly leaving a dangerous area.|$|E

25|$|Under the {{development}} plan, future phases {{would see the}} addition of several new midfield concourses and a new south terminal.

If this runway is built, the current runway will be redesignated as 12L-30R while the new runway will be designated 12R-30L. An expansion of the B concourse, used by many low cost airlines as well as international arrivals, has been completed, and the building housing Concourses C and D will eventually be knocked down {{to make room for}} a more ergonomic building.
