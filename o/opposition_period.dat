2500|$|In the United States, the {{registration}} process includes several steps. First, the trademark owner files an application {{to register the}} trademark. About three months after it is filed, the application is reviewed by an examining attorney at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The examining attorney checks for compliance with {{the rules of the}} Trademark Manual of Examination Procedure. This review includes procedural matters such as making sure the applicant's goods or services are identified properly. It also includes more substantive matters such as making sure the applicant's mark is not merely descriptive or likely to cause confusion with a pre-existing applied-for or registered mark. If the application runs afoul of any requirement, the examining attorney will issue an office action requiring the applicant to address certain issues or refusals prior to registration of the mark. If the examining attorney approves the application, it will be [...] "published for opposition." [...] During this 30-day period third parties who may be affected by {{the registration}} of the trademark may step forward to file an Opposition Proceeding to stop the registration of the mark. If an Opposition proceeding is filed it institutes a case before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to determine both the validity of the grounds for the opposition as well as the ability of the applicant to register the mark at issue. Finally, provided that no third-party opposes the registration of the mark during the <b>opposition</b> <b>period</b> or the opposition is ultimately decided in the applicant's favor the mark will be registered in due course.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} British Conservatism and ‘modernization’, principally between 1945 and 2005. It argues that Conservative ‘modernization’ in opposition has typically embraced three key elements: leadership, policy and organization. The precise nature of ‘modernization’ has differed in each <b>opposition</b> <b>period,</b> and with mixed results. From 1945 - 79, it ‘worked’, {{at least to}} the extent that the Party returned to power within a few years; even so, ‘modernization’ per se was not enough. Conversely, the period from 1997 to 2005 was one of ‘failed modernization’. Yet, while this may have adversely affected the Party’s performance in the 2001 and 2005 General Elections, there are good reasons to suppose it would have been defeated anyway. The paper then reviews the Conservative leadership election of 2005, in which three of the contenders offered different accounts of what ‘modernization’ should entail. It concludes that there is (still) no consensus in the Party on this vital question; that David Cameron's ‘modernization project’ is by no means assured of ultimate victory in the Party; and that ‘modernization’ per se is unlikely to deliver a Conservative victory at the next General Election...|$|E
