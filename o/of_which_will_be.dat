5|$|Arriving in Thunderbird 2, Virgil deploys three Elevator Cars, two <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{remote-controlled}} {{from his}} master vehicle. Fireflash will be guided into a controlled landing {{on top of}} the cars, touching down with its undercarriage raised. Virgil and the Elevator Cars rush to intercept the inbound Fireflash on Runway 29, but when one of the remote-controlled cars malfunctions and crashes into a Boeing 727, which explodes twice on impact, the rescue attempt is aborted and the operation suspended while Virgil activates a reserve car. Fireflash starts a second run and successfully makes contact with all three vehicles. Applying brakes, Virgil loses control of the master car, which crashes into a trench; he is uninjured, however, and Fireflash comes to a halt before reaching the end of the runway. The bomb is dislodged from its original position but ultimately fails to explode.|$|E
5|$|Due to delays {{with the}} Raine Square development, the Bank was forced in November 2009 {{to seek a}} 5-year renewal of its lease in the Bankwest Tower, the {{remainder}} <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> taken on by Raine Square property developer Saracen Properties. Saracen Properties announced in May 2009 {{that they would not}} seek to renew their lease, and would vacate at the termination of their lease in November 2009. It was also revealed that the 50th floor office space once occupied by Alan Bond was still in the same condition as when he left in 1991, with Bond's former chair, desk and boardroom table available as part of the lease.|$|E

5|$|With {{water levels}} above the {{structure}} remaining fairly constant, £400,000 {{was spent on}} refurbishing City Mills Lock. Although some work had been carried out in 2006, including the fitting of new metal gates, it was not operational, and had not been used for around 40 years. The second phase of restoration included fitting the equipment to automate its operation. The first public use of the lock occurred on 31 July 2010. British Waterways hoped to restore the Carpenters Road Lock soon afterwards, but the project was postponed until {{after the completion of}} the Olympic games, as temporary 'Land Bridges' were erected over the site of the lock to enable pedestrians to reach the stadium, some <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> removed after the event. Following the Olympic games, it is hoped the waterways will continue to be used by both commercial and leisure craft.|$|E

The Jerusalem Light Rail began {{operation}} in 2011, while major construction on Tel Aviv's light rail, much <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> underground, commenced in 2011. In Haifa, an extensive BRT system called the Metronit was built, which has stops at a few Carmelit stations. It was hoped that this will increase ridership on the Carmelit after the Metronit system began operating in late 2013.|$|E
25|$|In {{stationary}} organisms, such as plants, exploitative competition plays a {{much larger}} role than interference competition because individuals are rooted to a specific area and utilise resources in their immediate surroundings. Saplings will compete for light, most <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> blocked and utilised by taller trees. The saplings can be easily out-competed by larger {{members of their own}} species, {{which is one of the}} reasons why seed dispersal distances can be so large. Seeds that germinate in close proximity to the parents are very likely to be out-competed and die.|$|E

25|$|A {{total of}} 34 railway {{stations}} are situated along the line, {{all of which}} are disabled-accessible, with the exception of El Putxet, Sarrià and Peu del Funicular stations. 19 out of 34 stations are underground, while the rest are at-grade, and 6 out of 34 are transfer stations. The opening of the extension of the Sabadell branch will suppose the incorporation of 5 new underground stations, one <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a transfer station to the Rodalies de Catalunya commuter and regional rail system.|$|E
25|$|This {{situation}} {{was compounded by}} the assumption {{by the state of}} the banks' debts in 2008. The Irish government led by Brian Cowen, following a late-night meeting with all the senior banking officials in the country on 30 September 2008, agreed to cover all of the banks debts. This debt, now estimated at over €50 billion, (over half <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> paid to Anglo Irish Bank) imposed a heavy burden on the tax-payer and severely damaged Ireland's ability to borrow money from the International Bond markets.|$|E
