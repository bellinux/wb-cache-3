5|$|Christian Donlan of Eurogamer was {{surprised}} by the long length of the game and the amount <b>of</b> <b>variety</b> it offered given its simple premise. He enjoyed the game's pacing and felt that separating puzzles into short levels kept the game fun. Game Informer reviewer Kyle Hilliard also approved of the game's pacing. He remarked that BoxBoy!s low price and well-designed puzzles made it entirely worth playing. VentureBeat writer Gavin Greene agreed that the game offered a lot of content at an inexpensive price. The game's structure did draw some criticism from Jon Wahlgren, writing for Nintendo Life. He thought the game spent too much time teaching new mechanics and did not give players enough freedom to explore or experiment; as a result he believed the game felt restricted.|$|E
5|$|Coral reefs form {{some of the}} world's most {{productive}} ecosystems. Common coral reef cnidarians include both Anthozoans (hard corals, octocorals, anemones) and Hydrozoans (fire corals, lace corals). The endosymbiotic algae of many cnidarian species are very effective primary producers, in other words converters of inorganic chemicals into organic ones that other organisms can use, and their coral hosts use these organic chemicals very efficiently. In addition, reefs provide complex and varied habitats that support {{a wide range of}} other organisms. Fringing reefs just below low-tide level also have a mutually beneficial relationship with mangrove forests at high-tide level and sea grass meadows in between: the reefs protect the mangroves and seagrass from strong currents and waves that would damage them or erode the sediments in which they are rooted, while the mangroves and seagrass protect the coral from large influxes of silt, fresh water and pollutants. This additional level <b>of</b> <b>variety</b> in the environment is beneficial to many types of coral reef animals, which for example may feed in the sea grass and use the reefs for protection or breeding.|$|E

5|$|Despite the game's {{expanded}} memory resources, reviewers {{felt that the}} game's visuals were only marginally—if at all—better than for contemporary games, such as the previous year's Banjo-Kazooie. In fact, IGN felt that Donkey Kong 64 was not as pretty as Banjo-Kazooie, especially in its water and backgrounds, though it still ranked among the console's prettiest games. The setting is barren and nondescript at first, and only later introduces lighting effects and richer textures. IGN hoped for more from Rare, and while its reviewer praised the game's particle effects (e.g., in the desert wind), he considered the game's dynamic lighting overused. N64 Magazine said that the enhanced effects were most often used for decoration, though they also played some role in puzzles based on illuminating paths. Reviewers noted graphical difficulties even with the extra memory, such as frame rate slowdowns and distant features not appearing in any detail, though overall they considered the added graphical flourishes commendable. GameSpot also saw a lack <b>of</b> <b>variety</b> in the game's environment.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to taxonomic research, collections can provide information {{relevant to the}} study <b>of</b> <b>variety</b> of other ornithological questions, including comparative anatomy, ecology, behavior, disease, and conservation. Forensic ornithologists use collections to identify species involved in aircraft bird strikes, imported materials containing bird parts, and birds killed through various human activities, legal and illegal. In addition, collections are used by zooarchaeologists to identify bird bones at prehistoric human sites or species of origin for feathers used in human cultural artifacts. Collections also have been heavily used by artists, particularly {{for the production of}} plates for ornithological field guides. The close-up observation and opportunity for manipulation provided by preserved study skins makes them, together with field observations and photography, to be an important basis for painters of field guide plates of birds. Most bird species have several unique plumages that distinguish immature from adults, males from females, and breeders from non-breeders. Thus, many different specimens may be required to produce a thorough plate for identification of a given species. Accurate colour measurements using spectrometry are possible from specimens.|$|E
5|$|In early 1929 Robey {{returned}} to South Africa and then Canada for another tour with Bits and Pieces, {{after which he}} started another series <b>of</b> <b>variety</b> dates back in England. Among the towns he visited was Woolwich, where he performed to packed audiences {{over the course of}} a week. Here he met the theatre managers Frank and Agnes Littler, with the latter briefly becoming his manager. In 1932 Robey appeared in his first sound film, The Temperance Fête, and followed this with Marry Me, which was, according to his biographer A. E. Wilson, one of the most successful musical films of the comedian's career. The film tells the story of a sound recordist in a gramophone company who romances a colleague when she becomes the family housekeeper.|$|E
40|$|A <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> topological algebras is a {{class of}} topological algebras closed under taking Tychonov products, closed subalgebras and {{continuous}} homomorphic images. A compact semilattice S is a Lawson semilattice if every element of S has a basis of neigborhood subsemilattices. The structure of the lattice <b>of</b> <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> discrete bands was elucidated by Birjukov [1], Fennemore [2] and Gerhard [3]. The result can be transfered immediately to the lattice of pseudovarieties of finite bands, since the free band over any finite alphabet is finite [4]. A profinite <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> semigroups is {{a class of}} profinite semigroups closed under Tychonov products, closed subsemigroups, and profinite homomorphic images. The lattice <b>of</b> <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> profinite semigroups is isomorphic to the lattice of pseudovarieties of finite semigroups [5]. Theorem. All the minimal non-trivial subvarieties <b>of</b> the <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> compact bands are the <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> compact Lawson semilattices, the <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> compact left zero semigroups and the <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> compact right zero semigroups. It is known that the <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> compact Lawson semilattices CL is a proper subvariety <b>of</b> the <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> compact semilattices C. Open Problem.

40|$|In {{an earlier}} work, the author {{observed}} that Boolean inverse semi-groups, with semigroup homomorphisms preserving finite orthogonal joins, form a congruence-permutable <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> algebras, called biases.

In particular, the word problem for free biases is decidable. (2) Every proper <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> biases contains a largest finite symmetric inverse semigroup, {{and it is}} generated by its members that are generalized rook matrices over groups with zero.

5|$|The Driver {{has been}} {{compared}} to the Man With No Name, a character Clint Eastwood portrayed in the Sergio Leone western, because he almost never speaks, communicating mostly non-verbally. The Driver's meager dialogue is not designed to present him as tough, but to soften him. Refn chose to give The Driver very little dialogue and instead have him drive around listening to synth-pop music, taking control when it counts. Peter Debruge <b>of</b> <b>Variety</b> opined that what The Driver lacks in psychology, he makes up through action and stylish costuming. The Driver's wardrobe, in particular the satin jacket with the logo of a golden scorpion on the back, was inspired by the band KISS, and Kenneth Anger's 1964 experimental film Scorpio Rising. Refn sees the former as the character's armor, and the logo as a sign of protection. According to reviewer Peter Canavese, the jacket is a reference to the fable of the scorpion and the frog, mentioned in the film, which in turn evokes its use in the Orson Welles film Mr. Arkadin.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of Alienation was hinted at in early January 2014 and {{announced at the}} 2014 Sony Gamescom convention. In 2015, the developers released details of the gameplay and classes and its first trailer. According to Sony, the game would be released sometime in 2015; it was delayed until March 2, 2016. After another three-week delay, it was released {{as part of a}} Sony promotion releasing six games in seven weeks. Since the release of Alienation, Housemarque has updated the game with free and paid expansions. It received positive reviews, with praise for the twin-stick elements and cooperative multiplayer feature. Reviewers criticized the lack of a local co-op mode, which was later added, and the game's lack <b>of</b> <b>variety</b> in regard to weapons and ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Variety borealis has a {{slightly}} darker color scheme than the main species. The coloration in general is darker; the cap can vary from a bright apple red to a dark brick red with maturity, to almost purple in some instances. The pore surface has a varying coloration of orange red to red and becoming a dull brown red with age. The bruising coloration is a blue green and the spore print is olive brown. The distribution <b>of</b> <b>variety</b> borealis is relatively small, ranging from Michigan to the upper New England states. The similar distribution and coloration to Boletus carminiporus has caused the two to be confused. New molecular evidence shows that borealis is not closely related to Baorangia bicolor var. bicolor.|$|E
