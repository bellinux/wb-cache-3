50|$|Successful <b>O-ring</b> <b>joint</b> design {{requires}} a rigid mechanical mounting that applies a predictable deformation to the O-ring. This introduces a calculated mechanical stress at the O-ring contacting surfaces. As {{long as the}} pressure of the fluid being contained does not exceed the contact stress of the O-ring, leaking cannot occur. Fortunately, {{the pressure of the}} contained fluid transfers through the essentially incompressible O-ring material, and the contact stress rises with increasing pressure. For this reason, an O-ring can easily seal high pressure {{as long as it does}} not fail mechanically. The most common failure is extrusion through the mating parts.|$|E
5000|$|Despite their {{certainty}} of <b>O-ring</b> <b>joint</b> inadequacies {{as early as}} 1977, NASA launched an investigation to “discover” {{the cause of the}} disaster. According to Richard C. Cook, the Reagan administration appointed the Rogers Commission to perpetrate the same cover-up. In response, Cook provided the original O-ring warning documents to the New York Times. The resulting news article [...] initiated a series of disclosures regarding events that led to the disaster, including revelations by Morton Thiokol engineers that they had tried to stop the launch. These reports proved significant in predicting that faulty rubber seals on the solid fuel rockets might trigger a catastrophe, as the official investigations eventually concluded.|$|E
40|$|A {{special-purpose}} tool {{has been}} developed for measuring the depths of defects on an O-ring seal surface. The surface lies in a specially shaped ringlike fitting, called a capture feature tang, located on an end of a cylindrical segment of a case that contains a solid-fuel booster rocket motor for launching a space shuttle. The capture feature tang {{is a part of}} a tang-and-clevis, <b>O-ring</b> <b>joint</b> between the case segment and a similar, adjacent cylindrical case segment. When the segments are joined, the tang makes an interference fit with the clevis and squeezes the O-ring {{at the side of the}} gap...|$|E
40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} a digital control unit for a direct current motor of a tool for an industrial robot, such as an <b>O-ring</b> <b>jointing</b> device, a screwing device or similar, comprising a tacho-generator which detects the speed of rotation of the motor. The digital control unit according to the invention {{is characterized by a}} sensor interface which is applied with an output signal of the tacho-generator and the signals of other sensors such as force sensors, sensors for the gripper position, flange forces or similar, and the sensor interface which is connected to a microprocessor control unit for the motor, whose output signal is applied to the servo-amplifier for motor after a digital/analogue conversion...|$|R
5000|$|During the Space Shuttle design process, a McDonnell Douglas {{report in}} September 1971 {{discussed}} the safety record of solid rockets. While a safe abort was possible after most types of failures, one was especially dangerous: a burnthrough by hot gases of the rocket's casing. The report stated that [...] "if burnthrough occurs adjacent to hydrogen/oxygen tank or orbiter, timely sensing {{may not be}} feasible and abort not possible", accurately foreshadowing the Challenger accident. Morton Thiokol was the contractor responsible for the construction and maintenance of the shuttle's SRBs. As originally designed by Thiokol, the <b>O-ring</b> <b>joints</b> in the SRBs were supposed to close more tightly due to forces generated at ignition, but a 1977 test showed that when pressurized water was used to simulate the effects of booster combustion, the metal parts bent away from each other, opening a gap through which gases could leak. This phenomenon, known as [...] "joint rotation," [...] caused a momentary drop in air pressure. This {{made it possible for}} combustion gases to erode the O-rings. In the event of widespread erosion, a flame path could develop, causing the joint to burst—which would have destroyed the booster and the shuttle.|$|R
30|$|TiO 2 {{thin films}} were {{deposited}} on a glass substrate using a MOCVD reactor, whose system was fabricated using a quartz tube {{and stainless steel}} bodies connected through <b>O-ring</b> <b>joints.</b> The MOCVD apparatus was evacuated using a rotary pump. The glass substrate was pretreated with acetone, ethanol, and deionized water in an ultrasonic cleaner and mounted onto the graphite holder that was laid {{in the center of}} the MOCVD chamber. To fix the glass substrate onto the graphite holder tightly, we grooved the graphite holder and tilted it at an angle to get a thin film with a uniform surface. The graphite holder was heated using a DC power through a super-Kanthal wire (Sandvik Korea Ltd., Seoul, South Korea) inserted in it with a substrate temperature at 400 °C. The general deposition conditions are a temperature of 400 °C, a working pressure of 8.2 × 10 - 2 Torr, and a working time of 30 min. Titanium tetraisopropoxide (Ti[OCH(CH 3) 2] 4) [TTIP] was used as a precursor with heating at 60 °C and 75 °C and without a bubbler gas. The as-grown films were characterized with X-ray diffraction [XRD], scanning electron microscopy [SEM], atomic force microscopy [AFM], Fourier transform infrared spectrometry [FT-IR], contact angle measurement, and ultraviolet-visible [UV-Vis] spectroscopy.|$|R
40|$|Container {{maintains}} {{reference material}} for gas chromatography at constant temperature for extended periods. Developed for holding peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN), material unstable {{at room temperature}} but stable at 0 degree C. Keeps vial of PAN at this temperature by immersing in mixture of water and ice. Perforated tube surrounds vial, protects from damage by ice but allows cold water to circulate around. Plug with handle removable so ice added through filler tube. <b>O-rings</b> seal <b>joints</b> around removable parts. Substances undergoing phase changes at other temperatures substituted for ice and water if different reference materials and storage temperatures used.

Modified joint and seal essentially "inside-out" version of old <b>joint</b> and seal. <b>O-rings</b> placed between outer side of tang and clevis. Joint rotation pushes tang harder against O-rings, thereby making even tighter seal.

40|$|Significant {{design changes}} made to major {{components}} of the NASA Space Shuttle SRM are summarized. The extent of changes made in the nozzle-to-case joint to better protect the <b>joint</b> <b>O-ring</b> seals is indicated schematically as are changes made to the motor nozzle. It is noted {{that the use of}} subscale, full scale/short duration burn hardware tests to provide data for structural and thermal analytical models was necessary...|$|R
40|$|Redesign of the Space Shuttle Solid Booster has necessitated re-evaluation of the {{material}} used in the field <b>joint</b> <b>O-ring</b> seals. The viscoelastic characteristics of five candidate materials were determined. The five materials are: two fluorocarbon compounds, two nitrile compounds, and a silicon compound. The materials were tested in a uniaxial compression test to determine the characteristic relaxation functions. These tests were performed at five different temperatures. A master material curve was developed for each material from the experimental data. The results are compared to tensile relaxation tests. Application of these results to the design analysis is discussed in detail...|$|R
50|$|Each of the Space Shuttle's two Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) was {{constructed}} of seven sections, six {{of which were}} permanently joined in pairs at the factory. For each flight, the four resulting segments were then assembled in the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), with three field joints. The factory joints were sealed with asbestos-silica insulation applied over the joint, while each field joint was sealed with two rubber O-rings. (After the destruction of Challenger, the number of <b>O-rings</b> per field <b>joint</b> was increased to three.) The seals {{of all of the}} SRB joints were required to contain the hot, high-pressure gases produced by the burning solid propellant inside, thus forcing them out of the nozzle at the aft end of each rocket.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} provide the {{necessary}} performance to launch polar-orbiting shuttles from the SLC-6 launch pad at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, SRBs using filament-wound cases (FWC) were designed to be more lightweight than the steel cases used on Kennedy Space Center-launched SRBs. Unlike the regular SRBs, which had the flawed field joint design {{that led to the}} Challenger Disaster in 1986, the FWC boosters had the [...] "double tang" [...] joint design (necessary to keep the boosters properly in alignment during the [...] "twang" [...] movement when the SSMEs are ignited prior to liftoff), but used the two O-ring seals. With the closure of SLC-6, the FWC boosters were scrapped by ATK and NASA, but their field joints, albeit modified to incorporate the current three <b>O-ring</b> seals and <b>joint</b> heaters, were later incorporated into the present-day field joints on the current SRBs.|$|R
5000|$|The Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, {{also known}} as the Rogers Commission after its chairman, was formed to {{investigate}} the disaster. The commission members were Chairman William P. Rogers, Vice Chairman Neil Armstrong, David Acheson, Eugene Covert, Richard Feynman, Robert Hotz, Donald Kutyna, Sally Ride, Robert Rummel, Joseph Sutter, Arthur Walker, Albert Wheelon, and Chuck Yeager. The commission worked for several months and published a report of its findings. It found that the Challenger accident was caused by a failure in the <b>O-rings</b> sealing a <b>joint</b> on the right solid rocket booster, which allowed pressurized hot gases and eventually flame to [...] "blow by" [...] the O-ring and make contact with the adjacent external tank, causing structural failure. The failure of the O-rings was attributed to a faulty design, whose performance could be too easily compromised by factors including the low temperature on the day of launch.|$|R
40|$|This project {{seeks to}} {{discover}} the primary causes of joint failure and to develop tools for the prediction {{of the failure of}} joints still in service. These tools will contribute significantly to the creation of an effective asset life cycle management strategy for the remaining reinforced concrete water mains. This will provide more accurate cost forecasting for the Asset Management Branch and will help to reduce the whole of life cost of their assets. Early analysis indicates that the majority of joint failures are caused by the rubber <b>O-ring</b> within the <b>joint</b> failing in its sealing capacity. The possible reasons for the loss of sealing capacity include a loss of elasticity, a loss of profile, rupture or a combination of these mechanisms. All mechanisms are thought to be affected by the ageing behaviour of rubber. As a result the effects of ageing on the mechanical properties of rubber are a focus of this study. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{loss of the}} Space Shuttle Challenger {{was caused}} by the failure of the aft <b>joint</b> <b>O-ring</b> seals in its right solid rocket booster. It has been {{suggested}} by several sources that wind conditions through a reduction in temperature of the right solid rocket booster caused by the wind blowing across the cold external tank, {{played a role in the}} O-ring failure. To check the plausibility of the wind theory, an experiment was carried out in a water towing tank to visualize the flow past a two-dimensional model representing a cross section of the Space Shuttle launch configuration. The periodic formation of vortices was found to characterize the wake generated by the model. It is suggested that this organized motion in the flow is the dominant mechanism that accomplishes heat transfer from the external tank to the right solid rocket booster. Flow visualization results consisting of photographs that show instantaneous streamline patterns of the flow are presented...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} for development and test verification of a thermal model used for prediction of joint heating environments, structural temperatures and seal erosions in the Space Shuttle Reusable Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) Nozzle Joint- 4. The heating environments {{are a result}} of rapid pressurization of the joint free volume assuming a leak path has occurred in the filler material used for assembly gap close out. Combustion gases flow along the leak path from nozzle environment to <b>joint</b> <b>O-ring</b> gland resulting in local heating to the metal housing and erosion of seal materials. Analysis of this condition was based on usage of the NASA Joint Pressurization Routine (JPR) for environment determination and the Systems Improved Numerical Differencing Analyzer (SINDA) for structural temperature prediction. Model generated temperatures, pressures and seal erosions are compared to hot fire test data for several different leak path situations. Investigated in the hot fire test program were nozzle joint- 4 O-ring erosion sensitivities to leak path width in both open and confined joint geometries. Model predictions were in generally good agreement with the test data for the confined leak path cases. Worst case flight predictions are provided using the test-calibrated model. Analysis issues are discussed based on model calibration procedures...|$|R
40|$|All {{inspection}} and instrumentation {{data indicate that}} the PV- 1 static test firing conducted 18 Aug. 1988 was successful. With {{the exception of the}} intentionally flawed joints and static test modifications, PV- 1 was flight configuration. Fail-safe flaws guaranteeing pressure to test the sealing capability of primary O-rings were included in the aft field joint, case-to-nozzle joint, and nozzle internal Joint 5. The test was conducted at ambient conditions, {{with the exception of the}} field joints and case/nozzle joints which were maintained at a minimum of 75 F. Ballistics performance values were within specification requirements. The PV- 1 motor exhibited chamber pressure oscillations similar to previously tested Space Shuttle redesigned solid rocket motors, particularly QM- 7. The first longitudinal mode oscillations experienced by PV- 1 were the strongest ever measured in a Space Shuttle motor. Investigation into this observation is being conducted. Joint insulation performed as designed with no evidence of gas flow within unflawed forward field joints. The intentionally flawed center and aft case field joint insulation performance was excellent. There was no evidence of hot gas past the center field <b>joint</b> capture feature <b>O-ring,</b> the case-to-nozzle <b>joint</b> primary <b>O-ring,</b> or the aft field <b>joint</b> primary <b>O-ring.</b> O-ring seals and barriers with assured pressure at the flaws showed erosion and heat effect, but all sealed against passage of hot gases with the exception of the aft field <b>joint</b> capture feature <b>O-ring.</b> There was no evidence of erosion, heat effect, or blowby on any O-ring seals or barriers at the unflawed joints. Nozzle performance was nominal with typical erosion. Post-test examination revealed that the forward nose ring was of the old high performance motor design configuration with the 150 -deg ply angle. All nozzle components remained intact for post-test evaluation. The thrust vector control system operated correctly. The water deluge system, CO 2 quench, and other test equipment performed as planned during all required test operations...|$|R
