40|$|Abstract: This paper {{reports on}} price {{formation}} in experimental markets {{in which a}} single seller trades with four buyers. Transactions occur if either a buyer accepts an <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> sell from the seller, or the seller accepts an <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> buy from a buyer. The dissemination of such offers is endogenous in that the seller determines which buyer(s) should be informed about <b>offers</b> <b>to</b> sell, whereas each buyer may broadcast his <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> buy {{to any of the}} residual buyers. Complete dissemination of offers is consistent with conventional double-auction trading rules. The result is two-fold. First, the diffusion of trading information is incomplete, in that neither the single seller nor the buyers inform all market participants about offers. Second, observed prices and the number of transactions are in line with the competitive theoretic benchmark. Keywords: Experimental economics, market structure, trading informatio...|$|R
