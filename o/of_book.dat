5|$|Some {{invertebrates}} have lung-like {{structures that}} serve a similar respiratory purpose as, {{but are not}} evolutionarily related to, vertebrate lungs. Some arachnids, such as spiders and scorpions, have structures called book lungs used for atmospheric gas exchange. Some species of spider have four pairs <b>of</b> <b>book</b> lungs but most have two pairs. Scorpions have spiracles on their body for the entrance of air to the book lungs.|$|E
5|$|Spiders have {{developed}} several different respiratory anatomies, based on book lungs, a tracheal system, or both. Mygalomorph and Mesothelae spiders have two pairs <b>of</b> <b>book</b> lungs filled with haemolymph, where openings on the ventral {{surface of the}} abdomen allow air to enter and diffuse oxygen. This {{is also the case}} for some basal araneomorph spiders, like the family Hypochilidae, but the remaining members of this group have just the anterior pair <b>of</b> <b>book</b> lungs intact while the posterior pair of breathing organs are partly or fully modified into tracheae, through which oxygen is diffused into the haemolymph or directly to the tissue and organs. The trachea system has most likely evolved in small ancestors to help resist desiccation. The trachea were originally connected to the surroundings through a pair of openings called spiracles, but in the majority of spiders this pair of spiracles has fused into a single one in the middle, and moved backwards close to the spinnerets. Spiders that have tracheae generally have higher metabolic rates and better water conservation. Spiders are ectotherms, so environmental temperatures affect their activity.|$|E
5|$|The Spartan king Demaratus {{had been}} {{stripped}} of his kingship in 491 BC, and replaced with his cousin Leotychides. Sometime after 490 BC, the humiliated Demaratus had chosen to go into exile, and had {{made his way to}} Darius's court in Susa. Demaratus would from then on act as an advisor to Darius, and later Xerxes, on Greek affairs, and accompanied Xerxes during the second Persian invasion. At the end of Herodotus's book 7, there is an anecdote relating that prior to the second invasion, Demaratus sent an apparently blank wax tablet to Sparta. When the wax was removed, a message was found scratched on the wooden backing, warning the Spartans of Xerxes's plans. However, many historians believe that this chapter was inserted into the text by a later author, possibly to fill a gap between the end <b>of</b> <b>book</b> 7 and the start <b>of</b> <b>book</b> 8. The veracity of this anecdote is therefore unclear.|$|E
