2500|$|A {{downstream}} {{demand valve}} {{serves as a}} fail safe for over-pressurization: if a first stage with a demand valve malfunctions and jams in the open position, the demand valve will be over-pressurized and will [...] "free flow". Although it presents the diver with an imminent [...] "out of air" [...] crisis, this failure mode lets gas escape directly into the water without inflating buoyancy devices. The effect of unintentional inflation might be to carry the diver quickly to the surface causing the various injuries that can result from an over-fast ascent. There are circumstances where regulators are connected to inflatable equipment such as a rebreather's breathing bag, a buoyancy compensator, or a drysuit, but {{without the need for}} demand valves. Examples of this are argon suit inflation sets and [...] "off board" [...] or secondary diluent cylinders for closed-circuit rebreathers. When no demand valve is connected to a regulator, it should be equipped with a pressure relief valve, unless it has a built in <b>over</b> <b>pressure</b> valve, so that over-pressurization does not inflate any buoyancy devices connected to the regulator.|$|E
