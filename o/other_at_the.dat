Upon meeting each <b>other</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> recording studio, the actors, who at the time both co-starred in Guys and Dolls, were asked to record together as hyenas. The directors laughed at their performance and decided to cast them as Timon and Pumbaa. For the hyenas, the original intention was to reunite Cheech & Chong, but while Cheech Marin accepted to play Banzai, Tommy Chong was unavailable. Thus his role was changed into a female hyena, Shenzi, who was voiced by Whoopi Goldberg.|$|E

5|$|After rodents, bats are {{the largest}} order of mammals, making up about 20% of mammal species. There are 1,240 bat species which are {{traditionally}} recognized to belong to two suborders of bats: Megachiroptera (megabats), and the Microchiroptera (microbats/echolocating bats). Not all megabats are larger than microbats. Microbats use echolocation, but megabats do not, {{with the exception of}} the genus Rousettus. Microbats lack the claw at the second finger of the forelimb. The ears of microbats do not close to form a ring; the edges are separated from each <b>other</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> base of the ear. Megabats eat fruit, nectar, or pollen. Most microbats eat insects; others may feed on fruit, nectar, pollen, fish, frogs, small mammals, or the blood of animals. Megabats have well-developed visual cortices and good visual acuity, while microbats rely on echolocation for navigation and finding prey.|$|E

5|$|Dynamic {{balance is}} {{provided}} through the three semicircular canals. These three canals are orthogonal (at right angles) to each <b>other.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> {{end of each}} canal is a slight enlargement, known as the ampulla, which contains numerous cells with filaments in a central area called the cupula. The fluid in these canals rotates according to {{the momentum of the}} head. When a person changes acceleration, the inertia of the fluid changes. This affects the pressure on the cupula, and results in the opening of ion channels. This causes depolarisation, which is passed as a signal to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve. Dynamic balance also helps maintain eye tracking when moving, via the vestibulo–ocular reflex.|$|E

Harry Redknapp has had six spells {{managing}} Premier League football clubs (West Ham United, Portsmouth, Southampton, Portsmouth again, Tottenham Hotspur and Queens Park Rangers) winning a Manager of the Month award {{in each of those}} spells. Eight other managers have won an award with two or more clubs: Martin O'Neill with Leicester City, Aston Villa and Sunderland, Brendan Rodgers with Swansea City and Liverpool, Stuart Pearce with Nottingham Forest and Manchester City, Gordon Strachan with Coventry City and Southampton, Sam Allardyce with Bolton Wanderers and West Ham United, Mauricio Pochettino with Southampton and Tottenham Hotspur, Rafael Benítez with Liverpool and Chelsea and Claudio Ranieri with Leicester City and Chelsea. Eleven managers have won awards in consecutive months: Joe Kinnear, Kevin Keegan, Roy Evans, Ferguson, Arsène Wenger, David O'Leary, Paul Jewell, Rafael Benítez, Carlo Ancelotti, Manuel Pellegrini and Antonio Conte. Stuart Pearce also won consecutive awards; one {{at the end of the}} 2004–05 season, and the <b>other</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start of the 2005–06 season. Antonio Conte is the only manager in Premier League history to have won the award in three successive months (with Chelsea from October to December 2016). The award has been shared on one occasion, in March 2002, when Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier was jointly awarded Manager of the Month with caretaker manager Phil Thompson, who had deputised while Houllier was absent for medical reasons.|$|E
5|$|In 1823 Hogg met Jane Williams {{while they}} were both visiting Percy Shelley's friend John Gisborne, husband of Maria Gisborne. Jane and her common-law husband Edward Ellerker Williams had been housemates of Shelley's shortly before his death. Edward Williams and Shelley died in a boating accident, leaving Jane alone with two young children. Hogg soon became very enamoured with her. They saw each <b>other</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Gisborne {{household}} regularly during the autumn and early winter of 1823. That December {{he went back to}} Northern England to see his family.

In March she moved out of her mother's house into a home of her own, allowing Hogg to see her more freely.|$|E
