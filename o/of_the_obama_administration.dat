5|$|McCain {{entered the}} race for the Republican {{nomination}} for President in 2000, but he lost a heated primary season contest to George W. Bush of Texas. He secured the nomination in 2008 after coming back from early reversals, but was defeated by Democratic nominee Barack Obama in the general election, losing by a 365–173 electoral college margin. He subsequently adopted more orthodox conservative stances and attitudes and largely opposed actions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>administration,</b> especially in regard to foreign policy matters. By 2013, however, he had become a key figure in the Senate for negotiating deals on certain issues in an otherwise partisan environment. In 2015, McCain became chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, The Economist found that, aside from rhetoric, Romney's stated foreign policy {{positions}} offer {{in many instances}} broad continuity with those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>administration,</b> and that Obama's policies have closely followed the path set by the Bush administration.|$|E
25|$|During the 2008 US presidential campaign, Unger was in {{frequent}} {{contact with}} candidate Barack Obama via email and Blackberry.

25|$|CBO also {{estimated}} that if policies {{in place as}} of the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> continued over the following decade, real GDP would grow at approximately 2% per year, the unemployment rate would remain around 5%, inflation would remain around 2%, and interest rates would rise moderately. President Trump's economic policies can also be measured against this baseline.|$|E
25|$|On April 6, 2011, Wyden {{voted against}} {{limiting}} the EPA’s ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

25|$|During Obama's {{last months}} in office, his {{administration}} {{chose not to}} veto United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, which urged <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> Israeli settlement in the territories that Israel captured in <b>the</b> Six-Day War <b>of</b> 1967. <b>The</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> argued that <b>the</b> abstention was consistent with long-standing American opposition to <b>the</b> expansion <b>of</b> settlements, while critics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abstention argued that it abandoned a close U.S. ally.|$|R
25|$|The Arctic {{is divided}} between 8 Arctic states {{that serve as}} {{permanent}} members of the Arctic Council. The primary policy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> within the region had been to facilitate cooperation among these states on regional issues. Upon assuming office, Obama had looked to reset relations with Russia across the board; however, as US–Russian relations deteriorated in other matters of mutual interest, the Arctic remained a site of cooperation between the two states.|$|E
25|$|The Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) was {{the program}} {{responsible}} for coordinating and integrating research {{on global warming}} by U.S. government agencies from February 2002 to June 2009. Because those reports were mostly issued after the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), {{and in some cases}} focused specifically on the United States, they were generally viewed within the United States as having an importance and scientific credibility comparable to the IPCC assessments for the first few years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>Administration.</b>|$|E
25|$|When Cabral was {{appointed}} Treasurer the banknote series was changed from series 2003 to series 2003A {{to indicate that}} a new Treasurer had been appointed, but not a new Secretary of the Treasury.

While her 5-year term as Treasurer ended on January 20, 2009 with the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>Administration,</b> her signature continued to appear on the series 2006A $100 banknote, which was printed until May 2013, pending the resolution of production problems with the new color $100 banknote.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{rapid transit}} to Pittsburgh International Airport. Former Allegheny County chief {{executive}} Dan Onorato {{had hoped to}} extend the Pittsburgh Light Rail system to the airport. In 2009, Onorato and Congressman Mike Doyle requested approximately $7 million in funding {{from the federal government}} for preliminary planning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extension. <b>The</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> in 2009 funded further research in the decade-long proposal to install a Maglev line from Pittsburgh International east to Downtown Pittsburgh and <b>the</b> eastern suburbs <b>of</b> Monroeville, Pennsylvania and Greensburg, Pennsylvania. However, the assets from the planned maglev were auctioned off in late February 2012.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> {{economic}} policy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Barack <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> {{was characterized by}} moderate tax increases on higher income Americans designed to fund healthcare reform, reduce the federal budget deficit, and improve income inequality. His first term (2009–2013) included measures designed to address the Great Recession and Subprime mortgage crisis, which began in 2007. These included a major stimulus package, banking regulation, and comprehensive healthcare reform.|$|R
50|$|China has 14 {{neighbouring}} nations by land, and 7 neighbours by sea (8 if counting Taiwan). Only Russia has as many neighbouring nations (14 by land, 12 by sea). Many disputes {{have arisen}} and resolved and many yet are undetermined. Recently these {{issues have been}} politicized by United States {{as part of their}} China containment policy and East Asian foreign policy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Barack <b>Obama</b> <b>administration.</b>|$|R
25|$|On 25 June 2014, the Senate {{confirmed}} Morin to be Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation. He {{served in}} that role until the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>Administration</b> on 20 January, 2017. During his tenure as CAPE director, Morin was associated with efforts to develop program plans and cost estimates for the B-21 bomber and Ground Based Strategic Deterrent ICBM program, to curtail production of the Littoral Combat Ship and instead produce a more powerful frigate, to use special groups like the Strategic Capabilities Office to develop innovative upgrades to existing systems, and to modernize DOD contract cost reporting methods.|$|E
25|$|Republicans {{strongly}} opposed Obama's 2009 {{economic stimulus package}} and 2010 health care reform bill. The Tea Party movement, formed in early 2009, provided a groundswell of conservative grassroots activism to oppose policies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>administration.</b> With an expected economic recovery being criticized as sluggish, the GOP was expected to make big gains in the 2010 midterm elections. However, establishment Republicans began to see themselves at odds with Tea Party activists, who sought to run conservative candidates in primary elections to defeat the more moderate establishment-based candidates. Incumbent senators such as Bob Bennett in Utah and Lisa Murkowski in Alaska lost primary contests in their respective states.|$|E
25|$|Ghailani was transported from Guantanamo Bay to New York City {{to await}} {{trial in the}} United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in June 2009. When the case came to trial, the judge {{disallowed}} the testimony of a key witness. On November 17, 2010, a jury found him guilty of one count of conspiracy, but acquitted him of 284 other charges including all murder counts. Critics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> said the verdict proves civilian courts cannot be trusted to prosecute terrorists because it shows a jury might acquit such a defendant entirely. Supporters of the trial {{have said that the}} conviction and the stiff sentencing prove that the federal justice system works.|$|E
40|$|This report {{examines}} reform priorities from <b>the</b> perspective <b>of</b> {{several key}} actors, including Members <b>of</b> Congress, <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>Administration,</b> selected member states, the U.

N. reform and mechanisms for implementing reform, as well as possible challenges facing U. S. policy makers as they consider existing and future U. N. reform efforts...|$|R
50|$|Before <b>the</b> opening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 111th Congress, Emanuel {{accepted}} {{a position as}} White House Chief <b>of</b> Staff in <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>Administration.</b> Larson succeeded Emanuel as caucus chair, and Becerra won his bid to succeed Larson as Vice-Chair.

5|$|Many {{commentators}} credit Obama with averting {{a threatened}} depression and pulling the economy {{back from the}} Great Recession. According to <b>the</b> U.S. Bureau <b>of</b> Labor Statistics, <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> created 11.3million jobs from the month after <b>the</b> first inauguration <b>of</b> Barack <b>Obama</b> to <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> his term.|$|R
25|$|After the {{election}} of Obama for president, Republicans in Congress were unified in almost total opposition to the programs and policies of Obama and the Democratic majority. They unsuccessfully attempted to stop an $814 billion stimulus spending program, new regulations on investment firms, and a program to require health insurance for all Americans. They did keep emissions trading from coming to a vote, and vow {{to continue to work}} to convince Americans that burning fossil fuel does not cause global warming. The slow growth of the economy {{in the first two years}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> led Republicans to call for a return to tax cuts and deregulation of businesses, which they perceived as the best way to solve the financial crisis. Obama's approval rating steadily declined in his first year in office before leveling off at about 50-50. This decline in popularity led to a GOP landslide in the mid-term elections of 2010.|$|E
25|$|Twenty-two members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> {{are either}} in the United States Cabinet (15) or are in {{positions}} considered to be Cabinet-level (7) and must be confirmed by the current Senate. The members of the Cabinet are {{the heads of the}} fifteen major departments (State, Defense, Justice, etc.), and the seven cabinet-level positions are the Vice President, White House Chief of Staff, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador to the United Nations, and Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. Since Robert Gates {{was a member of the}} previous administration, his letter of resignation (a formality at the end of a President's term) was simply not accepted, and he did not need confirmation. On January 19, 2009, Senate Democratic leaders requested fifteen of the twenty-two positions to be ratified by unanimous consent, and seven gained unanimous confirmation by voice vote the next day: Ken Salazar, Steven Chu, Arne Duncan, Peter Orszag, Eric Shinseki, Tom Vilsack, and Janet Napolitano. On January 21, Obama presided over the swearing in of the seven unanimous nominees. Later that day, the Senate confirmed Hillary Clinton by a 94–2 vote. On January 22, several more confirmations were approved unanimously: Susan E. Rice, Ray LaHood, Lisa P. Jackson, and Shaun Donovan. On January 26, the Senate confirmed Timothy Geithner by a 60–34 margin, and Holder was confirmed on February 2 by a 75–21 margin. Of the 31 nominations that Obama has made to senior posts only 17 were approved in January.|$|E
500|$|In June 2011, Obama {{said that}} the bond between the United States and Israel is [...] "unbreakable". During the initial years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>administration,</b> the U.S. {{increased}} military cooperation with Israel, including increased military aid, re-establishment of the U.S.-Israeli Joint Political Military Group and the Defense Policy Advisory Group, {{and an increase in}} visits among high-level military officials of both countries. The Obama administration asked Congress to allocate money toward funding the Iron Dome program in response to the waves of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel.|$|E
2500|$|Portman has {{expressed}} concern about <b>the</b> slow pace <b>of</b> approving loan guarantees for developing nuclear power facilities by <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> Energy during <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>administration.</b> [...] Portman would later co-sponsor {{an amendment to the}} 2017 Energy Bill that specifies climate change is real and human activity contributes to the problem.|$|R
50|$|Democratic Senator Hillary Clinton {{resigned}} to become United States Secretary <b>of</b> State in <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>Administration.</b> Kirsten Gillibrand {{had been appointed}} to the seat by Governor David Paterson in 2009, and won the general election on November 2, 2010, to hold the seat for <b>the</b> remainder <b>of</b> its term, against Republican Joseph J. DioGuardi.|$|R
50|$|Governor David Paterson {{appointed}} then-U.S. Representative Kirsten Gillibrand {{to serve}} as U.S. Senator from New York until the 2010 special election, succeeding former U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton, who resigned {{to serve as}} U.S. Secretary <b>of</b> State in <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>administration.</b> Gillibrand won <b>the</b> special election in 2010 with 62.95% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vote over former U.S. Representative Joseph DioGuardi.|$|R
