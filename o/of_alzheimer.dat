25|$|Alzheimer's Disease: A study {{published}} in Archives of Neurology in February 2003 suggested that the intake of both trans fats and saturated fats promote the development <b>of</b> <b>Alzheimer</b> disease, although not confirmed in an animal model. It {{has been found that}} trans fats impaired memory and learning in middle-age rats. The trans-fat eating rats' brains had fewer proteins critical to healthy neurological function.

These are the exact types of changes normally seen at the onset of Alzheimer's, but seen after six weeks, even though the rats were still young.|$|E

Here we show substantial accumulation of Abs 40 and 42 in the brain arterioles <b>of</b> <b>Alzheimers</b> patients and <b>of</b> transgenic <b>Alzheimers</b> mice. PurifiedAbs 1 - 40 and 1 - 42 exhibited vascular regression activity in the in vivo animal models and vessel density was reversely correlated with numbers and sizes of amyloid plaques in human patients. A significant high number of vascular cells underwent cellular apoptosis in the brain vasculature <b>of</b> <b>Alzheimers</b> patients. VEGF significantly prevented Ab-induced endothelial apoptosis in vitro. Neuronal expression of VEGF in transgenic mice restored memory behavior <b>of</b> <b>Alzheimers.</b> These findings provide conceptual implication of improvement of vascular functions as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment <b>of</b> <b>Alzheimers</b> disease...|$|R
40|$|Background/Objective: Bariatric surgery can reverse {{cognitive}} impairments associated with obesity. However, such benefits may be attenuated in {{individuals with a}} predisposing risk for cognitive impairment such as family history <b>of</b> <b>Alzheimer’s</b> disease. Methods: In all, 94 bariatric surgery participants completed a computerized cognitive test battery before and 12 weeks after surgery. Family history <b>of</b> <b>Alzheimer’s</b> disease was obtained through self-report. Results: In the overall sample, cognitive function improved in memory and attention/executive function 12 weeks post-surgery. Repeated measures showed similar rates of improvements in attention/executive function between patients with and without a family history <b>of</b> <b>Alzheimer’s</b> disease. In contrast, only individuals without a family history <b>of</b> <b>Alzheimer’s</b> disease exhibited post-operative improvements in memory. A family history <b>of</b> <b>Alzheimer’s</b> disease was associated with greater post-surgery rates of cognitive impairment. Conclusions: Family history <b>of</b> <b>Alzheimer’s</b> disease may limit post-surgery cognitive benefits. Future studies should examine whether weight loss can modify the course of cognitive decline in patients at-risk for Alzheimer’s disease...|$|R

40|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} a devastating {{neurological}} disorder that affects more than 37 million people worldwide. The economic burden <b>of</b> <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease is massive; in the United States alone, the estimated direct and indirect annual cost of patient care is at least $ 100 billion. Current FDA-approved drugs for Alzheimer's disease do not prevent or reverse the disease, and provide only modest symptomatic benefits. Driven by the clear unmet medical need and a growing understanding of the molecular pathophysiology <b>of</b> <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease, the number of agents in development has increased dramatically in recent years. Truly *disease-modifying' therapies that target the underlying mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease have now reached late stages of human clinical trials. Primary targets include beta-amyloid, whose presence and accumulation in the brain is thought {{to contribute to the}} development <b>of</b> <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease, and tau protein which, when hyperphosphorylated, results in the self-assembly of tangles of paired helical filaments also believed {{to be involved in the}} pathogenesis <b>of</b> <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease.

Current developments in autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease are presented, including the international Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network and this network's initiative for clinical trials.

50|$|The {{definitive}} diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>Alzheimer's</b> {{disease can}} only be made following the demonstration {{of the presence of}} beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the pathologic hallmarks <b>of</b> <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease in brain tissue, typically at autopsy. While the cognitive impairments of the disease could be monitored throughout the disease course, clinicians had no reliable way to monitor the pathologic progression of the disease. Due to this fact, a clear understanding of the process of amyloid deposition and how amyloid deposits relate to the cognitive symptoms <b>of</b> <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease remains to be elucidated. While sophisticated centers for the treatment <b>of</b> <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease are able to diagnose the disease with some reliability based on its clinical presentation, the differential diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease from other dementias is less robust. Furthermore, as novel disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease that attack and remove beta-amyloid deposits from the brain enter clinical trials, a pre-mortem tool for assessing their effectiveness at clearing the amyloid deposits was a much needed development.|$|R
