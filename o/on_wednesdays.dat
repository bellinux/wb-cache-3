5|$|Passenger {{traffic was}} sparse {{through most of}} the life of the railway. In 1905, three trains per day ran from Goole to Haxey Junction and back, with a {{separate}} train operating on the Fockerby Branch. By November, only the morning and evening train ran, except <b>on</b> <b>Wednesdays.</b> A coal strike in 1912 resulted in all services being withdrawn except <b>on</b> <b>Wednesdays</b> and Saturdays for a period of three weeks. At a public meeting held in October 1920, users complained about the poor service and the lack of trucks to carry goods.

5|$|In 1907, {{the company}} looked at using petrol-electric autocars for the {{passenger}} services, but were advised {{that they would}} not be economic, as conventional trains would still be required <b>on</b> <b>Wednesdays</b> and Saturdays to cope with the volume of traffic. However, in July 1926 they conducted trials with a Sentinel-Cammell steam railcar, which was borrowed from the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), who had absorbed the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, bought 13 steam railcars in 1926 and 1927, one of which was allocated to Goole shed for work on the Axholme Joint Railway. A similar vehicle was ordered in February 1930 specifically for the railway, and entered service in December. The steam power unit was built by the Sentinel Waggon Works in Shrewsbury, and the bodywork was built at Nottingham, at the former works of Cammell Laird, by then part of the Metropolitan-Cammell Carriage, Wagon and Finance Company. Before passenger services were withdrawn in 1933, it ran , working two return trips from Goole to Haxey Junction on weekdays, three <b>on</b> <b>Wednesdays,</b> and five on Saturdays. It was then sold to the LNER and continued in use until 1944.|$|E
