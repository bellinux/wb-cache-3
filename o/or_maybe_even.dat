5|$|Black drongos {{become active}} very early {{at dawn and}} roost later than many other birds. They feed mainly on insects such as grasshoppers, cicadas, termites, wasps, bees, ants, moths, beetles and dragonflies. They {{sometimes}} fly close to tree branches, attempting to disturb any insects that may be present. They congregate in fields that are being ploughed, picking up exposed caterpillars and beetle grubs. As many as 35 birds have been seen at such congregations. They are also attracted to fires in scrub and grasslands habitats where insects are disturbed. They appear to avoid flies. They associate with common mynas, cattle egrets and other birds that share a similar diet and habitat. Drongos benefit from this association and are more successful in their foraging. There is only partial overlap in the insect prey sought by mynas and drongos although in rare instances the drongos may rob prey from mynas. It is said that they imitate {{the call of the}} Shikra so as to put mynas to flight and then to steal prey. Similar behaviour, using false alarm calls, has been noted in the fork-tailed drongo. There are some cases of the black drongo preying on small birds, reptiles, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>even</b> bats. They have also been on occasion seen feeding on fish Flowers of trees such as Erythrina and Bombax may be visited for water and nectar and they are sometimes known to feed on grains. They are only rarely known to take larger arthropods such as scorpions and centipedes. They feed on milkweed butterflies that are often avoided by other predators and are known to feed late in the evening or night, often on insects attracted to artificial lights.|$|E

500|$|Until Grant McColley, a {{historian}} of early Modern English literature, published his [...] "The Date of Godwin's Domingo Gonsales" [...] in 1937, {{it was thought}} that Godwin wrote The Man in the Moone relatively early in his lifeperhaps during his time at Christ Church from 1578 to 1584, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>even</b> as late as 1603. But McColley proposed a much later date of 1627 or 1628, based on internal and biographical evidence. A number of ideas about the physical properties of the Earth and the Moon, including claims about [...] "a secret property that operates {{in a manner similar to}} that of a loadstone attracting iron", did not appear until after 1620. And Godwin seems to borrow the concept of using a flock of strong, trained birds to fly Gonsales to the Moon from Francis Bacon's Sylva sylvarum ("Natural History"), published in July 1626.

5000|$|Employers {{may require}} their {{domestic}} workers {{to wear a}} uniform, livery or other [...] "domestic workers' clothes" [...] when in their employers' residence. The uniform is usually simple, though aristocratic employers sometimes provided elaborate decorative liveries, especially for use on formal occasions. Female servants wore long, plain, dark-coloured dresses or black skirts with white belts and white blouses, and black shoes, and male servants and butlers would wear something from a simple suit, or a white dress shirt, often with tie, and knickers. In traditional portrayals, the attire of domestic workers especially was typically more formal and conservative than that of those whom they serve. For example, in films of the early 20th century, a butler might appear in a tailcoat, while male family members and guests appeared in lounge suits or sports jackets and trousers depending on the occasion. In later portrayals, the employer and guests might wear casual slacks or even jeans, while a male domestic worker wore a jacket and tie or a white dress shirt with black trousers, necktie <b>or</b> bowtie, <b>maybe</b> <b>even</b> waistcoat, <b>or</b> a female domestic worker either a blouse and skirt (or trousers) or a uniform.|$|R

40|$|Estimation of structure, {{such as in}} {{graphical}} modeling, {{cluster analysis}} or variable selection, is notoriously difficult, especially for high-dimensional data. We introduce the new method of stability selection. It is based on subsampling in combination with (high-dimensional) selection algorithms. As such, the method is extremely general and has a very wide range of applicability. Stability selection provides finite sample control for some error rates of false discoveries and hence a transparent principle to choose a proper amount of regularization for structure estimation <b>or</b> model selection. <b>Maybe</b> <b>even</b> more importantly, results are typically remarkably insensitive to the chosen amount of regularization. Another property of stability selection is the improvement over a prespecified selection method. We prove for randomized Lasso that stability selection will be model selection consistent even if the necessary conditions needed for consistency of the original Lasso method are violated. We demonstrate stability selection for variable selection, Gaussian graphical modeling and clustering, using real and simulated data. ...|$|R

However, the duality in curved spacetime does not have the same generality as in flat spacetime and it holds only if the system satisfies certain constraints. We derive these constraints and the basic equations of duality and discuss the implications in the quantum theory. According to [1], there exists a duality between the Cartesian coordinates of flat spacetime and the solutions of the equation of motion of a certain physical systems. In the nonrelativistic case, this duality allows to express the coordinates as functionals on the wave functions of an one particle quantum system and some other functionals called prepotentials introduced in [2](see also [3, 4].) In Minkowski spacetime all the Cartesian coordinates are functionals on the solutions of the classical Klein-Gordon equation and prepotentials.

[...] Derek Watson argued that Molotov could get the best deal with Britain and France because he was not encumbered with the baggage of collective security and could more easily negotiate with Germany.

Are they {{using them to}} support the {{teaching}} of professions {{and if this is}} the case, do they introduce virtual worlds into the curriculum to develop and/or expand students' professional learning networks? Are they using virtual worlds to transform their teaching and learning? In recognition of the exciting opportunities that virtual worlds present for higher education, the DEHub Virtual Worlds Working Group was formed. It is made up of Australian university academics who are investigating the role that virtual worlds will play in the future of education and actively implementing the technology within their own teaching practice and curricula. This paper presents a typology for teaching and learning in 3 D virtual worlds and applies the typology to a series of case studies based on the ways in which academics and their institutions are exploiting the power of virtual worlds for diverse purposes ranging from business scenarios and virtual excursions to role-play, experimentation and language development. The case studies offer insight into the ways in which institutions are transforming their teaching for an unknown future through innovative teaching and learning in virtual worlds. The paper demonstrates how virtual worlds enable low cost alternatives to existing pedagogies as well as creating opportunities for rich, immersive and authentic activities that would otherwise not be feasible <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> not <b>even</b> be possible.
