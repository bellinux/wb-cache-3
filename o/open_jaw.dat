These frame features are: Eye gaze toward the locus (which is no longer pointed at with the hand), an <b>open</b> <b>jaw,</b> and a hand (or hands, in the case of two-hand verbs) in front of the trunk which moves in an arc to the onset location of the basic verb (in this case, touching the chin), while the trunk rotates and the signer inhales, catching her breath during the final hold. The hand shape throughout the sign is whichever is required by the final hold, in this case a G hand.|$|E

But in the Pequods case this has been negated by the thick veneer of barbarity that has been overlaid onto the ship in the form of fantastic scrimshaw embellishment. Far from enjoying mere utilitarian replacements out of available whalebone, she has been ornately decorated, even to the whale teeth set into the railing that now resemble an <b>open</b> <b>jaw.</b> Like a fingerbone necklace on a cannibal, these adornments are clear evidence of the Pequods success as a hunter and killer of whales.|$|E

5000|$|As {{they got}} closer, {{they found the}} ATDA {{to be in a}} slow rotation, with the conical nose shroud still attached, the two pieces hanging agape at the front like a giant, <b>open</b> <b>jaw.</b> Stafford {{described}} [...] "It looks like an angry alligator out here rotating around". He asked if maybe he could use the spacecraft to open the 'jaws' but the ground decided against it, fearing this might cause damage to the spacecraft.The crew described how the shroud’s explosive bolts had fired but, because the quick disconnect lanyards that were designed to unlock the electrical connectors to the explosive bolts had not been hooked up, the electrical wiring to the bolts held the two 1-1/2 inch wide steel shroud retaining bands together. If the electrical wires were cut {{on one side of the}} shroud, the two steel bands would immediately straighten and, being still held together by the wires on the opposite side of the shroud, it was difficult to predict the path of the released bands. Their ability to rip open a space suit caused the salvage mission to be abandoned. At the Cape, backup pilot Buzz Aldrin suggested that Cernan cut the electric wires with surgical scissors from the equipment pack. An experiment on the ground demonstrated this could indeed slice the wires, but also showed the ATDA bristled with dangerous, sharp edges. Ground controllers were, in Deke Slayton's words, [...] "just aghast" [...] at the idea, which did not take into consideration the substantial risks of the energy in the released shroud retaining bands holding the shroud halves together, the constant spinning of the ATDA, or the fact that the released shroud retaining bands, might whip back, and puncture Cernan's spacesuit.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: An {{open mouth}} {{approach}} {{is used in}} voice therapy for enhancing speech and voice production and relaxing the laryngeal musculature. The acoustic and physiological consequences of an <b>open</b> <b>jaw</b> posture, however, have not been clearly understood due to a paucity of cross-system studies taking the age effect into consideration. The major aims {{of this study are}} twofold (1) to examine if the geriatric voice may be improved using an “open jaw” posture and (2) if an aging effect on the voice of normal healthy adults can be detected through acoustic and physiological measures Method: The main part of this study involved simultaneous multi-channel voice recordings obtained from 85 healthy adults aged between 38 and 93 years. A convenience sampling strategy was used to recruit at least five females and five males in each of four age groups, 35 - 59 years (35 +), 60 - 69 (60 +), 70 - 79 (70 +), and above 80 (80 +). For simultaneous acoustic, electroglottographic (EGG), and jaw displacement recordings, participants were asked to perform two tasks which included a sustained vowel task and a sentence production task. The sustained vowel task involved sustaining the vowel /a/ in five different conditions, an isolated vowel /a/ produced at normal, low, and high pitch levels and the vowel /a/ initiated with a consonant (/m/ and /h/). The sentence production task involved production of the sentence 'We saw two cars,' containing the vowels /i, ɔ, u, a/. For simultaneous airflow-EGG recordings, participants were asked to sustain the vowel /a/ at normal pitch. For simultaneous airflow-air pressure-EGG recordings, participants were asked to repeat /pa/ five times in one breath. Participants were asked to perform all of the tasks using two jaw postures (normal and open). A series of univariate analysis of variances were used to identify instrumental measures sensitive for discriminating between the four age groups and the two jaw postures. A follow-up perceptual study was conducted to determine the effect of an <b>open</b> <b>jaw</b> posture on vowel intelligibility and voice clarity. A quota sampling strategy was used to recruit 40 normal hearing participants, including 20 females (age range = 18 - 42 years, mean = 25. 3, SD = 7. 9) and 20 males (age range = 18 - 47, mean = 23. 6, SD = 6. 7). These listeners were presented with vowels segmented from the sentences recorded in the first experiment and asked to perform a vowel identification and a voice clarity discrimination task. The vowel samples were taken from 40 speakers, with five females and five males {{in each of the four}} age groups (35 +, 60 +, 70 +, and 80 +). The percentages of correct vowel identification for voices produced with normal and <b>open</b> <b>jaw</b> postures were compared. The percentages of vowels judged as 'clearer' in a normal-open jaw contrast pairs were also calculated for comparison. Results: Significant age group effects were found in this study for both genders on fundamental frequency (F 0), voice onset time (VOT) (/ka/), open quotient (OQ), and speed quotient (SQ), with additional age differences detected for females on %jitter, %shimmer, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the second formant frequency (F 2), and for males a significant age group effect was found on VOT (/tu/). Results for both females and males revealed significant <b>open</b> <b>jaw</b> posture effects on F 0, F 2, VOT (/ka/), MFR, SPL and vowel space area. In addition, for females significant posture effects were found on F 1, subglottal pressure and the H 1 -H 2 amplitude difference, and for males, significant posture effects were found on %jitter and VOT-/tu/. Results from the follow-up perceptual study revealed that an <b>open</b> <b>jaw</b> posture was associated with better vowel identification and better voice clarity. Conclusions: A selection of instrumental measures was shown to be useful for detecting voice changes due to aging. Instrumental and perceptual evidence was found that an <b>open</b> <b>jaw</b> posture was associated with positive changes in vocal behaviours, including improved phonatory stability, vocal power, and voice clarity...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Airway {{dimensions}} are {{closely linked to}} the bone and soft-tissue craniofacial anatomy. Reduction of the airway is seen with airway disorders and can impair function. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine whether changing from open to closed jaw position affects the volume of the nasal cavity, nasopharynx, and oropharynx; the soft palate; the soft-tissue thickness of the airway; and the most constricted area of the airway. Methods Following reliability studies, in this retrospective study, we analyzed cone-beam computed tomography scans taken in both closed and <b>open</b> <b>jaw</b> positions of 60 subjects who were undergoing diagnosis and treatment of temporomandibular disorders. On each scan, condyle-fossa measurements, volumes of airway segments (nasal cavity, nasopharynx, oropharynx), soft palate areas, soft tissue thicknesses of the airway, and the most constricted area of the airway and its location were measured using Dolphin imaging software (version 11. 5; Patterson Dental Supply, Chatsworth, Calif). Differences between the 2 jaw positions were analyzed with paired t tests, accepting P ≤ 0. 05 as significant. Results Significant changes in airway dimensions were found between the closed and <b>open</b> <b>jaw</b> positions. With jaw opening, the nasopharynx volume increased, whereas the oropharynx volume decreased. Significant decreases were also found for measurements of basion to posterior airway wall, cervical vertebrae to posterior airway wall, most constricted area, nasal cavity volume, and soft palate area when the jaw was open. Conclusions Changing jaw position significantly affects airway dimensions...|$|E

40|$|This study utilises {{instrumental}} {{measures to}} {{examine the effect of}} jaw opening on the speech and voice of normal-hearing and hearing-impaired (HI) children. The simultaneous recording system employed consisted of acoustic recording, electroglotography (EGG), and a marker-based facial tracking device. Participants, aged between 9 and 12 years, included nine normal hearing children (4 females and 5 males) and six children with hearing impairments (3 females and 3 males). Participants were instructed to say the standard word list used for the Goldman-Fristoe Test of Articulation and a list of words including each of the vowels /i/, /a/, and /u/, preceded by the consonants /b/, /g/, or /s/ in a CV, CVC or CVCV context. In total, the second word list included 45 words (3 vowels X 3 consonants X 5 trials) and participants were asked to repeat a second time using an <b>open</b> <b>jaw</b> posture. Measures of the acoustic signals included: frequencies of formants one and two (F 1, F 2), fundamental frequency (F 0), percent jitter, percent shimmer, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), vowel length, consonant length, and spectral moments (M 1 and M 2). Vowel spaces, derived from F 1 and F 2, were also analysed. The EGG measures included fundamental frequency, open quotient, and speed quotient. The marker-based facial tracking signals was analyzed to derive the measure of maximum jaw displacement. Individual participants’ measures were submitted to a series of two-way Analysis of Variances (ANOVAs) and the average data for participants in the normal-hearing group to a series of twoway repeated measures ANOVAs. Results showed that increased jaw opening led to an increase in vowel area (as shown by the F 1 /F 2 plots of the vowels /i/, /a/ and /u/). A significant decrease in SNR was also found for many participants in the <b>open</b> <b>jaw</b> condition, indicating increase vocal stability. The HI participants showed smaller vowel areas than their normal-hearing peers. These results suggest the utility of increase jaw opening may increase vowel area and voice quality for both HI and normal-hearing children...|$|E

30|$|Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) {{disorders}} {{refer to}} a group of conditions affecting the TMJ, masticatory muscles, and associated structures. TMJ disorders are characterized by pain, noise within the joint, limited range of motion, impaired jaw function, and closed or <b>open</b> <b>jaw</b> locking. The most common TMJ disorder is disc displacement. In most patients with this disorder, the disc is displaced anteriorly upon translation. Anterior disc displacement (ADD) without reduction of the TMJ is a widespread disorder that clinically presents itself with restricted mandibular movements, in which the morphology of the disc or condylar surface is altered. ADD leads to a greater loss of elasticity in the superior retrodiscal lamina. The disc can be forced through the discal space, eventually collapsing the joint space behind it and trapping the disc in the forward position. During mouth opening, the affected joint exhibits rotation, but translation is limited or non-existent. The articular surfaces of the bones are exposed to a greater degree of wear, which may progress to osteoarthritis in later life [1 – 4].|$|E
