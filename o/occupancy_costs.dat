The research focuses on head office locations for large service firms in the Paris region, with particular emphasis on FIRE (finance, insurance, real estate) industries and other service industries such as legal, accounting and consulting firms. While occupiers generally refer to rent per sq. m. when looking for a new office location, this new measure of global <b>occupancy</b> <b>cost</b> per employee takes account of per-employee occupancy ratios. This research shows that although a new building has a higher rent per sq. m. than a second hand building, it is generally also more efficient and allows better optimization of surface use for the occupier.

Corporate real estate generally involves activities such as long-term leasing, acquisition, in some cases ground-up developments, management, and disposal of real estate assets. Due to the long lasting nature of real estate, corporate real estate decisions are non-easily reversible. Different industries approach corporate real estate in ways that best support their operational needs. This paper quantitatively compares the relationship between the share price, <b>occupancy</b> <b>costs</b> per employee, and net income during the period 1999 to 2013 for U. S. Fortune 500 financial and technology companies. The first part of the paper explains our data collection methodology. We collected share prices and extracted data from 10 -k filings submitted to the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The extracted data consists of firm gross revenue, net income, total full-time employee number, plant, property equipment (PPE), real estate PPE, rental expense, and <b>occupancy</b> <b>costs.</b> The derivation of <b>occupancy</b> <b>costs</b> is also explained in this part. The second part studies the relationship between share price, <b>occupancy</b> <b>costs,</b> and net income for the two sectors. Consistent with our expectations, there is positive and significant correlation between share price and net income for both sectors. On the contrary, the market punishes technology firms for higher <b>occupancy</b> <b>costs</b> per employee but not as much for financial firms. The third part of the paper examines the relationship between <b>occupancy</b> <b>costs</b> and net income per employee. Contrary to common belief that <b>occupancy</b> <b>costs</b> per employee would negatively affect the net income generated by each employee, we discover a positive correlation between the two which we believe is a result of reversed causality. by Chee San Sandra Choy.

This includes awareness to energy consumption which could have negative consequences on the environment. In recent years, it was suggested to increase energy saving by deactivating base stations during periods in which the traffic is expected to be low. In this paper we study the optimal deactivation policies, using recent tools from Multimodularity (which is the analog concept of convexity in optimization over integers). We consider two scenarios: In the first case, a central control derives the optimal open loop policies so as to maximize the expected throughput of the system given that at least a certain percentage of Base stations are deactivated (switched OFF). In the second case, we derive optimal open loop polices, which each base station can employ in a decentralized manner to minimize the average buffer <b>occupancy</b> <b>cost</b> when the fraction of time for which the BS station is deactivated (idle mode) is lower bounded. In both the cases, we show that the cost structure is Multimodular and characterize the structure of optimal policies...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveThe study’s {{objective}} was to identify predictors of prolonged ventilation and assess clinical and cost implications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. MethodsPatients undergoing cardiac surgery were classified as (1) ventilated less than 96 hours or (2) ventilated 96 hours or more. Multivariate modeling was used to identify predictors of prolonged ventilation and to ascertain the impact of prolonged ventilation on in-hospital mortality and bed <b>occupancy</b> <b>costs</b> and 5 -year survival. ResultsA total of 7553 patients were studied; 197 (2. 6 %) had prolonged ventilation. Median ventilation times were 8 and 192 hours, and in-hospital mortality was 1. 0 % and 22. 2 % in the control and prolonged ventilation groups, respectively (P <. 001). In-hospital mortality remained higher in the prolonged ventilation group after adjustment and when comparing propensity-matched patients (odds ratio 8. 06; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 4. 27 - 15. 2; P <. 001 for propensity-matched groups). Independent predictors of prolonged ventilation were as follows: older age, New York Heart Association class, ejection fraction less than 50 %, creatinine greater than 200 μmol/L, multiple valve replacements, aortic procedures, operative priority, reoperation for bleeding, inotropes, and preoperative intra-aortic balloon pump. Five-year survival was lower in the prolonged ventilation group (56. 1 % [95 % CI 46. 6 %- 64. 6 %] vs 88. 8 % [95 % CI 87. 9 %- 89. 6 %]) also after adjustment for imbalances and when comparing propensity-matched patients (hazard ratio 2. 39; 95 % CI 1. 75 - 3. 27; P <. 001 for propensity-matched groups). Mean bed <b>occupancy</b> <b>costs</b> were $ 14, 286 (95 % CI $ 12, 731 -$ 15, 690) and $ 2761 (95 % CI $ 2705 -$ 2814) in the prolonged ventilation and control groups, respectively (P <. 001).

Sprawl produces a 21 % increase in amount of undeveloped land converted to developed land (2. 4 million acres) and approximately a 10 % increase in local road lane-miles (188300).

It is unclear how effective these are at {{reducing the risk of}} bloodstream infections from the use of intravascular catheters (catheter-BSIs) and the associated costs and health benefits. AIM: To estimate the additional costs and health benefits from introducing such interventions and the costs associated with catheter-BSIs. METHODS: A comprehensive epidemiological and economic review was performed to develop the parameters for an economic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of introducing an educational intervention compared with clinical practice without the intervention. The model follows the clinical pathway of cohorts of patients from their admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), where some may acquire catheter-BSI, and estimates the associated costs, mortality and life expectancy. FINDINGS: The additional cost per catheter-BSI episode was £ 3940. The results of this model demonstrate that introducing an additional educational intervention to prevent catheter-BSI improved patient life expectancy and reduced overall costs. CONCLUSION: Introducing evidence-based education is likely to reduce the incidence of catheter-BSI and the model results suggest that the cost of introducing the interventions will be outweighed by savings related to reduced ICU bed <b>occupancy</b> <b>costs...</b>|$|E

The output of the model provides the project investment results, such as the Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR), payback period and investment growth ratio. The model can predict the unitary payment but also allows the user to define the unitary payment. The reports of the model contain the cash flow and investment ratio for both types of unitary payment. The model attempts to provide the information required to assess the feasibility and affordability of the project. It gives the private sector the chance to assess the project before they spend unrecoupable funds on the project. It allows the public sector to determine the project cost, cash flow, unitary charge, and provide the information to be used for the Public Sector Comparator. The data required for the development of the model was collected from different sources. The model was initially developed on spreadsheet software: the final version was transformed into a web-based model using the Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) and Javascript programming languages.
