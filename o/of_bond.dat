5|$|Maibaum kept {{on making}} rewrites as filming progressed. Red Grant {{was added to}} the Istanbul scenes just prior to the film crew's trip to Turkey—a change that brought more focus to the SPECTRE plot, as Grant started saving Bond's life there (a late change during {{shooting}} involved Grant killing the bespectacled spy at Hagia Sophia instead <b>of</b> <b>Bond,</b> who ends up just finding the man dead). For {{the last quarter of the}} movie, Maibaum added two chase scenes, with a helicopter and speedboats, and changed the location <b>of</b> <b>Bond</b> and Klebb's battle from Paris to Venice.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} real-life inspirations have been {{suggested}} for James Bond, the fictional character created in 1953 by British author, journalist and Naval Intelligence officer Ian Fleming; Bond appeared in twelve novels and nine short stories by Fleming, {{as well as a}} number of continuation novels and twenty-six films, with seven actors playing the role <b>of</b> <b>Bond.</b>|$|E
40|$|Thick {{bonding wires}} {{are used in}} modern power modules as {{connectors}} between integrated circuits, carrying current from one circuit to another. They experience high values of current, which generates heat through Joule heating {{and can lead to}} various failure mechanisms. Typically used wire materials in industry are aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), and intermetallic compounds of Cu-Al. They are broadly used because of their strength, high thermal conductivity, and low resistivity. This study reports on the influence of thermal loading on the mechanical behaviour <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> wires. Experimental techniques are developed and introduced in this thesis to analyze quasi-static and dynamic response <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> wires 300 µm in diameter. First, an experimental technique is developed to measure the quasi-static displacement <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> wires carrying DC currents. It is then deployed to measure the displacement, as well as peak temperature, of three types <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> wires, Al, Cu and Aluminum coated Copper (CuCorAl) to study the response under DC current. Secondly, an experimental technique is established and deployed for modal analysis <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> wires under thermal loading. Experimental results demonstrate a drop in the natural frequency <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> wires with increased thermal loads. Moreover, a harmonic analysis technique using thermal excitation is developed and applied to analyze the mode shapes and frequency response <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> wires. Furthermore, an analytical model and a finite element model are used to analyze static and dynamic responses <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> wires. Numerical and experimental results are compared in this thesis...|$|R
5000|$|At early common law, {{the penal}} {{obligations}} <b>of</b> <b>bonds</b> were enforced through an action of debt which {{was concerned with}} that penal obligation rather than the underlying agreement.

30|$|A {{chemical}} reaction involves breaking <b>of</b> <b>bonds</b> in reacting molecules and formation <b>of</b> new <b>bonds</b> in product molecules. The natures <b>of</b> <b>bonds</b> {{are different in}} different substances, and rates of {{chemical reaction}} differ a lot from one another. The rate of reaction depends upon structural and energetic factors (Puri et al. 1997).|$|R
5|$|Black also {{identifies}} {{a mechanism}} Fleming uses in Casino Royale—and in subsequent Bond novels—which {{is to use}} the evil of his opponents both as a justification of his actions, and as a device to foil their own plans. Black refers to the episode of the attempted assassination <b>of</b> <b>Bond</b> by Bulgarian assassins which results in their own deaths.|$|E
5|$|Budgetary reasons caused Licence to Kill to be {{the first}} Bond film shot {{completely}} outside the United Kingdom, with locations in both Florida and Mexico. The film earned over $156 million worldwide, and enjoyed a generally positive critical reception, with ample praise for the stunts, but attracted some criticism of Dalton's dark and violent interpretation <b>of</b> <b>Bond</b> {{and the fact that the}} film was significantly darker and more violent than its predecessors.|$|E
5|$|Devil May Care is a James Bond {{continuation}} novel {{written by}} Sebastian Faulks.

5|$|During {{the filming}} in Japan, it was {{announced}} that Sean Connery would retire from the role <b>of</b> <b>Bond,</b> but after a hiatus, he returned in 1971's Diamonds Are Forever and later 1983's non-Eon Bond film Never Say Never Again. You Only Live Twice is the first Bond film to be directed by Lewis Gilbert, who later directed the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me and the 1979 film Moonraker, both starring Roger Moore.|$|E
5|$|Fleming {{developed}} the James Bond character more in Goldfinger {{than in the}} previous six novels, presenting him as a more complex individual, whilst also bringing out a theme <b>of</b> <b>Bond</b> as Saint George. The Saint George theme is echoed {{by the fact that it}} is a British agent sorting out an American problem.|$|E
5|$|For {{the series}} <b>of</b> <b>Bond</b> novels, Fleming {{realised}} that without threatening villains Bond seemed less heroic: this tradition of strong literary villain was brought {{across to the}} screen in the Eon series. The third Bond film, Goldfinger, set a pattern for having a main villain with a loyal and dangerous henchman, a model which was followed in subsequent films.|$|E

Secondly, the relationships among bonding to caregivers, friends, romantic partners, as well as teachers, and adolescents' positive developmental outcomes are reviewed. Thirdly, with theoretical and empirical support, a discussion on how to promote bonding among adolescents is offered.

5|$|Higson {{stated that}} he was {{instructed}} by the Fleming estate to ignore all other interpretations <b>of</b> <b>Bond,</b> except the original Fleming version. As the background to Bond's childhood, Higson used Bond's obituary in You Only Live Twice {{as well as his}} own and Fleming's childhoods. In forming the early Bond character, Higson created the origins of some of Bond's character traits, including his love of cars and fine wine.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Amis {{produced}} The James Bond Dossier—a {{critical analysis}} of the Bond books under his own name—and The Book <b>of</b> <b>Bond,</b> a tongue-in-cheek manual for prospective agents, using the pseudonym Lt.-Col. William ("Bill") Tanner. Amis followed these books with the 1966 novel, The Anti-Death League, which had a plot filled with popular fiction elements and helped Amis prepare for Colonel Sun.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 Casino Royale {{was adapted}} into a parody Bond film {{starring}} David Niven as Sir James Bond and Ursula Andress as Vesper Lynd. Niven had been Fleming's {{preference for the}} role <b>of</b> <b>Bond.</b> The result of a court case in the High Court in London in 1963 allowed Kevin McClory to produce a remake of Thunderball titled Never Say Never Again in 1983. The film, produced by Jack Schwartzman's Taliafilm production company and starring Sean Connery as Bond, {{was not part of}} the Eon series <b>of</b> <b>Bond</b> films. In 1997 the Sony Corporation acquired all or some of McClory's rights in an undisclosed deal, which were then subsequently acquired by MGM, whilst on 4 December 1997, MGM announced that the company had purchased the rights to Never Say Never Again from Taliafilm. As of 2015, Eon holds the full adaptation rights to all of Fleming's Bond novels.|$|E

The results of this study show that there is {{no significant difference between the}} YTM bonds and the YTM of emitted sukuk. Using the Macaulay 2 ̆ 7 s duration formula to evaluate the duration <b>of</b> <b>bonds</b> and sukuk, the research found out that there is no significant difference in the duration <b>of</b> <b>bonds</b> and sukuk. However, the calculation and comparison of the VaR, showed a significant differences between bonds and sukuk, likewise either the comparison of the VaR of a sample group <b>of</b> <b>bonds</b> with a sample group of sukuk using k sample test.

5|$|It was {{not until}} the {{penultimate}} novel, You Only Live Twice, that Fleming gave Bond a sense of family background. The book was the first to be written after the release of Dr. No in cinemas and Sean Connery's depiction <b>of</b> <b>Bond</b> affected Fleming's interpretation of the character, to give Bond both a sense of humour and Scottish antecedents that were not present in the previous stories. In a fictional obituary, purportedly published in The Times, Bond's parents were given as Andrew Bond, from the village of Glencoe, Scotland, and Monique Delacroix, from the canton of Vaud, Switzerland. Fleming did not provide Bond's date of birth, but John Pearson's fictional biography <b>of</b> <b>Bond,</b> , gives Bond a birth date on 11 November 1920, while a study by John Griswold puts the date at 11 November 1921.|$|E
5|$|Later drafts see vice made {{central to}} the plot, with the Le Chiffre {{character}} becoming head {{of a network of}} brothels (as he is in the novel) whose patrons are then blackmailed by Le Chiffre to fund Spectre (an invention of the screenwriter). The racy plot elements opened up by this change of background include a chase scene through Hamburg's red light district that results in Bond escaping whilst disguised as a female mud wrestler. New characters appear such as Lili Wing, a brothel madam and former lover <b>of</b> <b>Bond</b> whose ultimate fate is to be crushed {{in the back of a}} garbage truck, and Gita, wife of Le Chiffre. The beautiful Gita, whose face and throat are hideously disfigured as a result <b>of</b> <b>Bond</b> using her as a shield during a gunfight in the same sequence which sees Wing meet her fate, goes on to become the prime protagonist in the torture scene that features in the book, a role originally Le Chiffre's.|$|E
