5|$|A lemon drop is a {{cocktail}} with a lemony, {{sweet and sour}} flavor, whereby the sweet and sour ingredients serve to contrast and balance one another. It is a vodka-based cocktail that is prepared with the addition <b>of</b> <b>lemon</b> <b>juice,</b> triple sec and simple syrup. Plain or citrus-flavored vodka {{may be used in}} its preparation, such as citron vodka. Lemon-flavored vodka is also sometimes used.

5|$|Edward Hack {{developed}} {{the original idea}} and model <b>of</b> <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> being contained inside lemon-shaped and coloured packaging in the 1950s. The product was then designed and produced by Cascelloid Ltd. Hack presented Cascelloid with a fresh lemon he acquired at Covent Garden, upon which to base the plastic container. Hack had performed significant searches at several markets to find an optimal model. Cascelloid stated that Hack reviewed and evaluated the entire inventory of lemons at Fortnum and Mason’s, Selfridges, Harrods and Covent Garden, the latter of which involved examining three cases of lemons that contained around 300 lemons in each case.|$|E
5|$|After ReaLemon {{met with}} success in European markets, Borden {{introduced}} {{it into the}} United Kingdom in 1975, as a 250 ml bottle <b>of</b> <b>lemon</b> <b>juice.</b> By 1980, ReaLemon comprised around 25% of the U.K. lemon juice market. In response to this competition, Reckitt & Coleman, the producers of Jif lemon juice began producing Jif in 150 ml- and 250 ml-sized bottles. Borden then began making plans to market ReaLemon in a lemon-shaped package that was similar to Jif's packaging. This resulted in a lawsuit initiated by Reckitt & Coleman against Borden, alleging that ReaLemon copied Jif's packaging to mislead consumers by confusing their product with Jif.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{efficacy}} <b>of</b> <b>Lemon</b> (Citrus lemonirisso) <b>juice</b> on {{wound healing}} of albino wistar rat was investigated; also the potential haemostatic mechanism associated with {{administration of the}} extract was investigated. Results showed that <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> extract decreased haemoglobin concentration, packed cell volume while it has no significant effect on platelet count, {{white blood cell count}} and white cell differential counts in albino rats. Furthermore, the bleeding and clotting times were shortened and the period of healing <b>of</b> wound using <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> could possess some elements that is affecting the haemostatic mechanism...|$|R
5|$|ReaLemon is {{prepared}} from <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> concentrate that is formulated at a controlled consistent strength, {{and after the}} addition of water, the end-product is a 100% <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> product.

40|$|<b>Lemon</b> <b>juice</b> {{obtained}} from Interdonato variety {{was treated with}} different enzymes at specific concentrations as depectinization processes to produce clear <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> and its concentrates. In addition, the best condition {{obtained from}} laboratory treatments {{was carried out in}} the local fruit juice plant. Effects of the processing steps on some quality parameters were investigated during the <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> production and the obtained concentrates were stored at − 25 °C for 180 days. The results showed that Novozym 33095 had the best depectinization effectiveness. Total pectin content <b>of</b> <b>lemon</b> <b>juices</b> decreased rapidly following the enzyme treatment and could not be detected following the filtration. Viscosity values decreased after pulp separation and the largest reduction was observed with the filtration. At the end of filtration in 40 [*]μL/ 100 [*]mL concentrations of each of the three enzymes, values of residual pectinmethylesterase (PME) activity were found to be in the lowest amounts...|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} notion <b>of</b> <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> being packaged inside lemon-shaped and coloured containers was {{the brainchild}} of Edward Hack in the 1950s. Bill Pugh, an English plastics designer, created a prototype based upon Hack's concept. The company Edward Hack, Ltd. then produced and marketed Hax brand lemon juice in the plastic containers, using juice from Sicily. Stanley Wagner of Coldcrops, Ltd. also independently designed a very similar package, which was used for Realemon brand lemon juice. Realemon was later renamed to ReaLem by Coldcrops. Hax lemon juice was the first to be packaged and marketed in said lemon-shaped container, with Coldcrops following shortly thereafter. A later agreement between Hax and Coldcrops led to Hax leaving the lemon juice business, whereby Coldcrops acquired the marketing rights for lemon juice in plastic lemon containers under the ReaLem brand. Coldcrops was acquired by Reckitt and Colman in 1956, which rebranded the product under the Jif brand name.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{destruction}} from processes {{other than}} dental caries {{is considered a}} normal physiologic process but may become severe enough to become a pathologic condition. Attrition {{is the loss of}} tooth structure by mechanical forces from opposing teeth. Attrition initially affects the enamel and, if unchecked, may proceed to the underlying dentin. Abrasion is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from a foreign element. If this force begins at the cementoenamel junction, then progression of tooth loss can be rapid since enamel is very thin in this region of the tooth. A common source of this type of tooth wear is excessive force when using a toothbrush. Erosion is the loss of tooth structure due to chemical dissolution by acids not of bacterial origin. Signs of tooth destruction from erosion is a common characteristic in the mouths of people with bulimia since vomiting results in exposure of the teeth to gastric acids. Another important source of erosive acids are from frequent sucking <b>of</b> <b>lemon</b> <b>juice.</b> Abfraction is the loss of tooth structure from flexural forces. As teeth flex under pressure, the arrangement of teeth touching each other, known as occlusion, causes tension {{on one side of the}} tooth and compression on the other side of the tooth. This is believed to cause V-shaped depressions on the side under tension and C-shaped depressions on the side under compression. When tooth destruction occurs at the roots of teeth, the process is referred to as internal resorption, when caused by cells within the pulp, or external resorption, when caused by cells in the periodontal ligament.|$|E

25|$|It took a {{few years}} before the method of {{distribution}} to all ships in the fleet had been perfected and the supply of the huge quantities <b>of</b> <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> required to be secured, but by 1800, the system was in place and functioning.

25|$|White wine is {{regularly}} {{used as an}} ingredient. Its acidity balances well with fat taking away excess heaviness. This acidity also refines the meat or fish and it helps {{to break down the}} fibres of the meat to make it tender. The role of white wine is similar to that <b>of</b> <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> used under the same conditions: once verjuice also fulfilled this function. The vinegar combines acidity with a burning sensation that gives recipes where it is used a bittersweet side characteristic.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, after Pro Arts Inc. {{pitched the}} idea of a poster of Fawcett to her agent, a photo shoot was {{arranged}} with photographer Bruce McBroom, who was hired by the poster company.

Her blonde highlights were further heightened by a squeeze <b>of</b> <b>lemon</b> <b>juice.</b> From 40 rolls of film, Fawcett herself selected her six favorite pictures, and eventually the choice was narrowed to the one that made her famous. The resulting image of Fawcett in a one-piece red bathing suit is the best-selling poster in history.|$|E
