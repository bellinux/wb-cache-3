There {{were no significant differences}} in demographic variables between the two samples. However, from a psychopathological point of view, psychiatric antecedents and cur-rent emotional instability were much more frequent and severe in aggressors within the com-munity. Therefore, two possible differential profiles among the violent men are presented. Implications of these results for further research and clinical practice are commented on...|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} masculinity as a dynamic risk factor in <b>offences</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> between men. It argues that existing interventions into such violence, in prison, hospital and community settings may {{be enhanced by}} incorporating masculinity as a dynamic risk factor alongside other dynamic risk factors such as difficulties in anger management, social skills deficits or problems in moral reasoning. Masculinity {{is defined as a}} common denominator of men, as men, across social divisions, as opposed to existing approaches to men's identity, as men, which employ the concept of different 'masculinities' being produced by men in different social positions. The latter approach, while useful in terms of discovering men's personal identity, may be less useful in terms of explaining commonality between men, across other axes of social identity, and consequent broad patterns <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> between men. The development of masculinity as a dynamic risk factor depends on isolating masculinity from other axes of men's identity. It is argued that the individual man may demonstrate his masculinity by two categories <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> to other men: violence which includes victims in the category 'man' as worthy rivals and violence which excludes victims from the category 'man' as unworthy of being there. Masculinity as a dynamic risk factor in man to man violence is developed with particular reference to racism and homophobia...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{efforts to}} develop and {{implement}} progressive models of transitional justice have been significantly influenced by major developments in the law concerning sexual violence in armed conflict. In particular, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has pioneered accountability for sexual violence against women in armed conflict. This article takes the ICTY as a case study of how gender can structure the accountability mechanisms of transitional justice. The article analyses how legal norms and practices instantiate and reiterate, rather than transform, existing hierarchical gender relations. It considers the existing models <b>of</b> sexual <b>violence</b> as a criminal harm under international law, and then examines gendered patterns of legal practice in ICTY prosecutions. To address this engendering of transitional justice, the article produces a new model of the harm <b>of</b> sexual <b>violence</b> in conflict, suggests {{the development of a new}} international <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> sexual <b>violence</b> and generates different strategies for international prosecutions <b>of</b> sexual <b>violence...</b>|$|R

The sample con-sisted of 52 men who were imprisoned in eight Spanish prisons. The psychological treat-ment was a cognitive-behavioral program, in a group format, with 20 weekly sessions that lasted for 8 months. The results showed a significant improvement of irrational beliefs, about both women and violence, as a strategy to cope with everyday difficulties and a significant decrease of psychopathological symptomatology, anger, and hostility. On the other hand, results indicated that the only difference between the patients who dropped out of treatment and those who completed it was the level of initial motivation for treatment.

40|$|This {{article is}} a defence <b>of</b> a {{differentiated}} <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> rape. A differentiated offence is an offence which can be completed {{in a number of}} different ways that cannot be captured in a simple definition. It is argued that such an offence would meet several concerns that have been expressed in the feminist literature about the law of rape. It would assist certainty, it would reduce the extent to which the offence focuses on the conduct of the complainant, it would allow the law to express that violence is central to the <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> rape where <b>violence</b> is present, but it would also allow convictions of rape where there is no violence. The argument is developed through critical engagement with the law of rape as set out in the Sexual Offences Act 2003.

Particular attention is paid to the special obligation called off-court agreement.

40|$|Aim: To {{identify}} the situational and offender characteristics associated with prison sentences for Apprehended Domestic Violence Order (ADVO) breaches. Method: Case narratives from police incident reports of ADVO breach incidents in NSW were analysed. Two samples were examined: (1) breach incidents where the offender involved was imprisoned (n= 250) and (2) breach incidents where the offender involved received a non-custodial sentence (n= 250). The {{nature of the}} breach and the characteristics of persons involved in these two breach samples were compared using descriptive data and logistic regression models. Results: The majority of ADVO breaches in both samples involved male to female offending in spousal/ex-spousal relationships, occurred in the victim’s house and involved face-to-face contact. Compared with offenders in the non-prison group, {{a higher proportion of}} offenders who received a custodial penalty for the breach ADVO matter were male, Indigenous, had 5 or more prior court appearances (including prior offences for domestic violence (DV), assault and breach ADVO), had 3 or more prior prison penalties and had breached two or more conditions of their order. Breaches resulting in prison also had a higher proportion of matters involving physical assault, property damage, psychological aggression and parties who had a history <b>of</b> <b>violence.</b> After controlling for other factors, the following factors were independently associated with imprisonment for ADVO; the offender’s gender, prior imprisonment, prior proven DV <b>offence,</b> history <b>of</b> <b>violence,</b> involvement <b>of</b> physical assault in the breach, victim/offender relationship and residing with the victim.

40|$|This {{research}} {{takes the}} form of a Foucauldian Genealogical Discourse Analysis and is premised upon the hypothesis that there is a cultural conflation <b>of</b> the <b>offences</b> <b>of</b> rape and murder produced within the dominant discourse of sexual murder. In examining the discourse across key institutional sites of media and police operational practice, common regimes of truth and discursive objects are identified and their relationship to power and knowledge analysed. A key aim was to establish if the powerful relationship existing between the <b>offences</b> <b>of</b> rape and murder is implicated in the skewed perception of rape trauma and rape as an offence, noted in previous research that is seen to impede successful prosecutions (Kelly et al 2005, Young 1998, Wolbert Burgess and Holstrom 1974).

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} gendered {{exercise}} of discretion {{at the various}} stages of the judicial process in the quarter session and assize courts of Yorkshire between 1735 and 1775.

This thesis augments knowledge in the historical argument regarding gender and crime for the period between those examined by Garthine Walker and Deirdre Palk and extends the coverage provided by Peter King.

40|$|High secure {{forensic}} inpatient hospitals {{provide a}} wide range of interventions in a restricted environment. Patients referred to high security will have both a serious and enduring mental disorder and have committed an <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> interpersonal <b>violence</b> with significant impact. The task of these services is to restore mental health well-being and reduce risk to prevent further harm to others. Evidence to demonstrate whether this task is achieved is limited, which has a number of implications for those who deliver care, those who receive it and the wider public. To develop a clearer understanding of the effectiveness of high secure hospital treatment three different approaches were taken to investigate the evidence base for this setting. A systematic review of existing outcome research from high secure hospitals was undertaken to establish its scope and rigour. Patients who were preparing to move on from high security were interviewed to explore perceived values of care that contributed to reaching this stage. A consultation of professional experts was conducted to determine what essential elements of high secure care were required to improve patient outcomes. Clinical evidence from the best available outcome research demonstrates that a range of interventions can improve the clinical and social functioning of patients. Pharmacological practices can help symptom reduction in patients with enduring schizophrenia and reduce aggression where violence is associated with symptoms. Psycho education can improve insight in patients with schizophrenia and cognitive behavioural therapies enhance coping skills for managing intense emotions, lowering risk <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> and preventing re-offending. Patient and professional perspectives on the values of treatment aligned with some of these benefits and also identified additional key processes for rehabilitation. Developing safe relationships with peers and therapeutic alliances with professionals was seen as essential in gaining insight into personal difficulties and promoting change. The use of clinical evidence, practitioner's experiences and patient's values demonstrates the contribution each source of information can make to uncovering and understanding a system of care. To establish how the sum of the high secure treatment parts impact on rehabilitation, and identify which package of treatment is best for whom, ideographic investigations that closely and longitudinally monitor change are recommended.

40|$|In the {{literature}} acts <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> are often {{divided into two}} dichotomous subtypes: instrumental and reactive violence. The two types <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> {{are considered to be}} underpinned by different theoretical paradigms, social learning theory and frustration aggression. This division, although widely criticised and lacking conceptual clarity, appears to be generally accepted in scientific literature. This exploratory study used multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis to see how violence characteristics co-occur in the <b>offences</b> <b>of</b> seriously violent psychopathic offenders; and whether the co-occurrence <b>of</b> <b>offence</b> variables could be explained by the instrumental and reactive dichotomy. The study also explored whether instrumental and reactive violence characteristics differentiate primary and secondary variants of psychopathy, with the hypotheses that primary psychopaths would show more instrumental features in their violence and secondary psychopaths show more reactive features. Findings show that violence characteristics do no co-occur as a mutually exclusive dichotomy and that rather, many violent acts have mix of reactive and instrumental characteristics, reflecting a dimensional rather than a dichotomous structure. This in turn suggests that act specific theories may not be necessary to describe different types <b>of</b> <b>violence.</b> Contrary to prediction, psychopathic subtypes did not differ on violence characteristics...|$|R
