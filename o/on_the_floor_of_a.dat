5|$|The {{music video}} opens with shots of Rihanna hooded, lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gas chamber. Three men, {{dressed in black}} uniforms and wearing dark round glasses {{circulate}} around the singer, attempting to extort information from her. The scene then moves to a dimly lit room in which Rihanna sits {{at a table with}} her love interest (played by American actor Jesse Williams) opposite. On the table between them lies a silver revolver in which, throughout the video, they take it turns holding to their heads. Other scenes include Rihanna in a woodland at night {{standing in the middle of}} a highway before a car speeds towards her, quickly cutting to another scene, giving the impression she is run over. Elements of blood and tears and vehicular assault dominate the video. In the final scenes, Rihanna is shown underwater, floating whilst being fired at; one bullet is visually seen cutting her throat. The video ends with her lover apparently committing suicide with the revolver placed between them.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolving}} and specializing outdoor games finally led to indoor versions {{that could}} be played on a table, such as billiards, or <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pub, like bowling and shuffleboard. The tabletop versions of these games became the ancestors of modern pinball.|$|E

A hit in its time, {{it was later}} pulled from the theaters after Warner Bros. successfully sued AIP over copyright issues.|$|E

25|$|The cup fungus, for instance, can {{be found}} in the Caribou. As the {{sanitary}} agents of the forest that consume dead organic matter, fungi spread <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> conifer area. Fungal spores blow in on the winds and take up residence at the foot of trees. One type, called the king bolete, is the edible mushroom most sought. Not all fungi have a symbiotic relationship with the trees, some fungi are parasitic, causing heartwood rot.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Connolly's first play, An' Me wi' a Bad Leg, Tae {{opened in}} Irvine and toured in London. It was there that, after {{consuming}} a sizable amount {{of cocaine and}} alcohol, he collapsed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> recording studio. In 1979, Connolly met Pamela Stephenson, the New Zealand-born comedy actress, {{for the first time}} when he made a cameo appearance on the BBC sketch show Not the Nine O'Clock News, in which she was one of four regular performers.|$|E
25|$|Evidence, from {{artifacts}} and the often large mosaics of great villas, indicates that one favorite sport of the agrarian elite was the hunt. Depicted are well-dressed sportsmen (in embroidered riding tunics with striped sleeves). Mounted on horseback they go cross-country {{in pursuit of}} illustrated game—here perhaps a jackal. Various wild birds are also shown as desired prey, to be gotten with traps. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> patio, a greyhound appears to be chasing a hare {{across the surface of}} its mosaic.|$|E

25|$|At first, little {{interest}} {{was shown in}} the parchment object itself. Madison had custody of it as Secretary of State (1801–1809) but having left Washington, he had lost track {{of it in the}} years leading to his death. A publisher had access to it in 1846 for a book on the Constitution. In 1883 historian J. Franklin Jameson found the parchment folded in a small tin box <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> closet at the State, War and Navy Building. In 1894 the State Department sealed the Declaration and Constitution between two glass plates and kept them in a safe.|$|E
25|$|Some wine experts {{debate the}} {{importance}} of humidity for proper wine storage. In the Wine Spectator, writer Matt Kramer cites a French study which claimed that the relative humidity within a bottle is maintained at 100% regardless of the closure used or {{the orientation of the}} bottle. However, Alexis Lichine contends that low humidity can still be detrimental to premium wine quality due to the risk of the cork drying out. As a way of maintaining optimal humidity, Lichine recommends spreading half an inch of gravel <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wine cellar and periodically sprinkling it with some water.|$|E
25|$|For this episode, Shin Bora, Heo Young-ji and Block B's Park Kyung {{appeared}} as special panelists. In between announcements of each girl's ranking {{during the first}} elimination, {{events leading up to}} the elimination are shown. Just after arriving at the dorms, the girls are taken to get flu shot. Weeks after, they are weighed and do a series of exercises with the help of trainer Ray Yang. Some girls are put on a strict diet in order to lose weight. The trainees are also tricked into participating in a 'hidden camera'. The first is a consideration test to see who will help a staff struggling with two heavy packs of water bottles. The second is a puddle of coke which was spilled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> waiting room to see if they will clean it up. The third is a $30,000 camera which a staff pretends to break during a fake interview. The staff tells each trainee that she might get fired, and some girls take responsibility, pretending it was them who broke it. The 97 trainees choose the 'top visual'. Pledis Entertainment's Zhou Jieqiong takes first place while Jung Chae-yeon, Kim Do-yeon, Kim Se-jeong, Kim Ji-sung, Seo Hye-lin, Park Si-yeon, Kwon Eun-bean, Ki Heui-hyeon (Cathy), Lee Su-hyun, and Jeon So-mi takes 2nd to 11th place respectively. Jang Keun-suk then announces the top 20 trainees and finally the 61st and last trainee, Happy Face Entertainment's Hwang A-young, who was saved from elimination.|$|E

500|$|Experience {{designer}} Bob Rogers and {{the design}} team BRC Imagination Arts, were commissioned to create the new post show experience entitled: [...] "The Assembly Experience." [...] The Assembly Experience is a walk-through environment, giving guest the illusion that they are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> vast automotive assembly plant. [...] Automotive doors, seats and engines glide overhead on assembly line chainveyors, while simulated automotive die-press caused the floor to [...] "rumble" [...] as each automotive part was pressed.

500|$|Lyrically, Perry is {{depicted}} as having suicidal thoughts and lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bathroom.

Perry commented on the lyrics: [...] " [...] are very exact and autobiographical. That's how I write. But the one thing about those lyrics is you can hear me finding my strength throughout the song. It starts off really low and then I kind of stand up for myself and say, 'No!'." [...] The song also sees Perry rejecting the idea that the relationship ended because of her.|$|E
