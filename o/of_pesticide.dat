5|$|By 1960, Carson {{had more}} than enough {{research}} material, and the writing was progressing rapidly. In addition to the thorough literature search, she had investigated hundreds of individual incidents <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> exposure and the human sickness and ecological damage that resulted. However, in January, a duodenal ulcer followed by several infections kept her bedridden for weeks, greatly delaying the completion of Silent Spring. As she was nearing full recovery in March (just as she was completing drafts of the two cancer chapters of her book), she discovered cysts in her left breast, one of which necessitated a mastectomy. Though her doctor described the procedure as precautionary and recommended no further treatment, by December Carson discovered that the tumor was in fact malignant and the cancer had metastasized. Her research was also delayed by revision work for a new edition of The Sea Around Us, and by a collaborative photo essay with Erich Hartmann. Most of the research and writing {{was done by the}} fall of 1960, except for the discussion of recent research on biological controls and investigations of a handful of new pesticides.

40|$|The use <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> {{in modern}} {{agriculture}} is unavoidable {{because they are}} required to control weeds. Pesticides are poisonous; hence, they are dangerous if misused. Understanding the fate <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> will be useful to use them safely. Therefore, contaminations of water and soil resources could be avoided. The fates <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> in soils are influenced by their sorption, decomposition and movement. Degradation and leaching <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> are control by sorption. Soil organic matter and clay content are main soil constituents that have a high capacity for sorption <b>of</b> <b>pesticides.</b> Addition <b>of</b> organic maters to amend the soils is a usual practice that every year has been done in a huge area of worldwide. Â  The added organic amendments to the soils affect the fate <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> in soils as well. Pesticides fates in different soils are different. The addition of organic matter to soils causes different fates for pesticides as well. It is known from the studies that sorption <b>of</b> non-ionic <b>pesticides</b> by soil in aqueous system is controlled mainly by the organic matter content of the soils. Sorption <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> has been reported to increase by amending soils with organic matter. In general, conditions that promote microbial activity enhance the rate <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> degradation, and those that inhibit the growth of microorganisms reduce the rate of degradation.

30|$|The {{frequent}} {{high concentrations}} (over guideline values) <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> {{detected in the}} current study are probably due to the extensive utilization <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> in the agricultural fields. There are three major sources for surface water contamination by pesticides: inappropriate handling <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> (e.g., washing equipment in the river), volatilization to air, and residuals from soil and water. In this perspective, the drainage of water from agricultural fields into irrigation channels poses a critical source of risk for contamination by pesticides in the broader water environment (Phong et al. 2010). Rain runoff from agricultural fields that occurred immediately after the application period <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> has been pointed to be the major source <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> in water bodies (Kreuger 1998). Rainfall, and hence the associated increased runoff, would be expected to result in increased movement <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> into nearby water bodies. However, the persistent nature <b>of</b> the <b>pesticides</b> is <b>of</b> great concern due to their bioaccumulative nature and toxic biological effects on wildlife and humans (Tanabe et al. 2000).|$|R
