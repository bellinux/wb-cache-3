5|$|Hugh Miller (1802–56) from Cromarty was a stonemason and self-taught geologist. His 1841 {{publication}} The <b>Old</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sandstone</b> {{became a}} bestseller. The fossils founds in these rocks {{were one of}} his fascinations, although his deep religious convictions led him to oppose the idea of biological evolution.|$|E
5|$|The {{island is}} {{composed}} {{of a variety of}} volcanic and sedimentary rock formations from the Devonian period. At that time the Scottish landmass formed part of the <b>Old</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sandstone</b> Continent and lay some 10-25 degrees south of the equator. The accumulations of <b>Old</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sandstone,</b> laid down from 408 to 370 million years ago, were created as earlier Silurian rocks, uplifted by the formation of Pangaea, eroded and then were deposited into river deltas. The freshwater Lake Orcadie existed on the edges of the eroding mountains, stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth. The structure of Papa Stour is largely made up of ashes and lavas from volcanic activity associated with this period, including bands of solidified volcanic ash and lava (rhyolite), {{but there is also a}} Devonian fish bed at Lamba Banks. There are numerous large boulders deposited by Pleistocene glaciation.|$|E
5|$|St Briavels Castle {{is located}} on a spur {{dominating}} a position above the River Wye, on {{the western edge of}} the Forest of Dean. The castle is predominantly built of local <b>old</b> <b>red</b> <b>sandstone</b> and limestone. The castle site is surrounded by an in-filled moat; now a garden, the moat was originally wet and fed by a spring underneath the moat itself.|$|E
5000|$|During {{historical}} {{times the}} beach was used by smugglers. To the northwest along the coast is Gravel Bay, Black Cave, East Pickard Bay, West Pickard Bay, Guttle Hole, Parsonsquarry Bay and Sheep Island.The headland between Sheep Island in the northwest and Linney Head in the southeast consists primarily of <b>red</b> <b>sandstones,</b> which [...] "form irregular, steep cliffswith fallen rocks {{at the back of}} beaches".Older Lower Palaeozoic mudstones and siltstones are situated towards the centre, and to both {{the north and the south}} are <b>old</b> <b>red</b> <b>sandstones.</b> Behind the bays are extensive dune fields such as Broomhill Burrows and Gupton Burrows and a river valley. The low cliffs on the south facing coast reach an elevation of 55 m, rising gently behind to 63 m.|$|R
50|$|St Leonard's is {{constructed}} of yellow sandstone, with <b>older</b> parts in <b>red</b> <b>sandstone,</b> and stone slate roofs. Its plan {{consists of a}} clerestoried nave and chancel under one roof with aisles {{to the north and}} south, and a tower to the north-west. The 19th century east window is a three lights window with a pointed head. The west window (perhaps also 19th century) has a pointed arch with three pointed lights and crossed mullions. Most of the remaining windows are square-headed with three rounded lights.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{research}} object {{presented in}} this paper is coupling effect of porous <b>red</b> <b>sandstone</b> which is more frequently encountered. And this paper use the test system of Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) to survey the impact test action of different porosity <b>red</b> <b>sandstone</b> in different coupling medium in order to obtained the dynamic waveform of fluid-solid coupling <b>red</b> <b>sandstone</b> under impact loading using theoretical analysis and laboratory data. The paper analyzes the impact of porosity, coupling medium on the dynamics characteristics of <b>red</b> <b>sandstone.</b> Based on the experiment study of different coupling medium <b>red</b> <b>sandstone</b> under cyclic impact loading, this paper discussed the dynamic characteristics law of porous sandstone under cyclic impact loading and analyzed theoretically the mechanism of coupling medium under cyclic loading. Porosity has a great influence on dynamic performance of <b>red</b> <b>sandstone.</b> Coupling medium has certain influence on the dynamic characteristics of <b>red</b> <b>sandstone.</b> All those conclusions laid a theoretical foundation for practical application...|$|R
5|$|The Old Man of Hoy {{is a red}} {{sandstone}} stack and {{perched on}} a plinth of basalt rock. It is separated from the mainland by a 60-metre (200ft) chasm strewn with debris, and has nearly vertical sides with a top just a few metres wide. The rock is composed of layers of soft, sandy and pebbly sandstone and harder flagstones of <b>Old</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sandstone,</b> giving the sides a notched and slab-like profile.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Old</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sandstone</b> is {{a series}} of red sandstones, marls and conglomerates. It rises as an {{anticline}} in the Mendips and appears in the Avon Gorge and at Portishead. Carboniferous Limestone, of marine origin, covers the sandstone and appears in the Avon Gorge and at Weston-super-Mare where it contains volcanic rocks. There are outlying hills at Worlebury, Middle Hope, the Failand Ridge, Broadfields Down, Portishead Down and Wrington Hill.|$|E
5|$|The area is {{underlain}} by Black Rock slate, Burrington Oolite and Clifton Down Limestone of the Carboniferous Limestone Series, {{which contain}} ooliths and fossil debris {{on top of}} <b>Old</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sandstone,</b> and by Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Keuper. Evidence for Variscan orogeny {{is seen in the}} sheared rock and cleaved shales. In many places weathering of these strata has resulted in the formation of immature calcareous soils.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} treat the {{collapse}} problem of <b>red</b> <b>sandstone</b> slope on Hunan Liu-Li Highway, laboratory experiments of its lithology were conducted, and the main parameters of <b>red</b> <b>sandstone</b> were acquired, including its basic physical properties, its disintegration characteristics, and its mineral compositions. By collecting research information of <b>red</b> <b>sandstone</b> slope, the main features and reasons of the slopes collapse were concluded. In comparison to the original and other treatments, {{the conclusion that the}} flexible protective technology is suitable for <b>red</b> <b>sandstone</b> slopes was reached...|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of <b>red</b> <b>sandstone,</b> such as structures and compositions and disintegration characteristics, were investigated {{through a series}} of tests including laboratory tests, a large-scale simulated experimental test, and tests in a section of a highway in China. With the disintegration tests, <b>red</b> <b>sandstone</b> was classified according to its engineering properties. With the understanding of the {{properties of}} <b>red</b> <b>sandstone,</b> the filling methods, and the construction techniques of roadbeds and embankments, including quality control and quality examination with associated criteria, were developed. This paper confirmed that these techniques can be successfully applied to solve a series of difficult problems in highway construction in <b>red</b> <b>sandstone</b> regions with considerable potential economical benefits and significant technological and engineering values...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Aimed at {{the feature}} of {{expressway}} subgrade drainage facilities in typical <b>red</b> <b>sandstone</b> areas in Jiangxi province {{and based on}} the importance of the structure, damage conditions, service requirements and the current specification requirements related to various types of ditches, the designed repetition period of rainfall and proposed safety depth values for drainage facilities were put forward by considering reasonably the key design parameters to regional drainage facilities. The relationship between prerequisite of discharging sediment in ditches or conduits and minimum longitudinal gradient was discussed. Combined with the characteristics of <b>red</b> <b>sandstone</b> subgrade drainage with high requirements, the design elements of <b>red</b> <b>sandstone</b> area expressway subgrade drainage system were obtained, which can provide beneficial references for the subgrade drainage design in <b>red</b> <b>sandstone</b> areas...|$|R
5|$|The {{superficial}} rock of Orkney {{is almost}} entirely <b>Old</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sandstone,</b> mostly of Middle Devonian age. As in the neighbouring mainland county of Caithness, this sandstone rests upon the metamorphic rocks of the Moine series, as may {{be seen on the}} Mainland, where a narrow strip is exposed between Stromness and Inganess, and again in the small island of Graemsay; they are represented by grey gneiss and granite.|$|E
5|$|Built {{predominantly}} of <b>Old</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sandstone,</b> {{the bridge}} {{was the subject of}} significant reconstruction and rebuilding in the 18th and 19th centuries. In those centuries, it also became a popular subject for artists; Turner, Gastineau and Cotman produced sketches of the bridge and gate. In the 20th century, it suffered increasing damage as higher volumes of traffic and the use of ever-larger vehicles led to several serious accidents. In the 21st century, {{the construction of a new}} road crossing to the south enabled the pedestrianisation of the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Granite {{intrusions}} {{are found}} in the parish of Barvas in west Lewis, and another forms the summit plateau of the mountain Roineabhal in Harris. The granite here is anorthosite, and is similar in composition to rocks found in the mountains of the Moon. There are relatively small outcrops of Triassic sandstone at Broad Bay near Stornoway. The Shiant Isles and St Kilda are formed from much later tertiary basalt and basalt and gabbros respectively. The sandstone at Broad Bay was once thought to be Torridonian or <b>Old</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sandstone.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Old Man of Hoy is a 449-foot (137m) sea stack on {{the island}} of Hoy, part of the Orkney {{archipelago}} off the north coast of Scotland. Formed from <b>Old</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sandstone,</b> {{it is one of the}} tallest stacks in Britain. The Old Man is popular with climbers, and was first climbed in 1966. Created by the erosion of a cliff through hydraulic action some time after 1750, the stack is no more than a few hundred years old, and may soon collapse into the sea.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Old</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sandstone</b> Continent {{became a}} part of the supercontinent Pangaea in the Permian (299–252 Ma), during which proto-Britain {{continued}} to drift northwards. Scotland's climate was arid at this time and some fossils of reptiles have been recovered. However, Permian sandstones are found in only a few places - principally in the south west, on the island of Arran, and on the Moray coast. Stone quarried from Hopeman in Moray has been used in the National Museum and Scottish Parliament buildings in Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|The geology of Shetland {{is complex}} with {{numerous}} faults and folds. These islands are Scotland's most northerly area of Caledonian orogenic rocks {{and there are}} outcrops of Lewisian, Dalradian and Moine metamorphic rocks with similar histories to their equivalents on the Scottish mainland. Similarly, there are also <b>Old</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sandstone</b> deposits and granite intrusions. The most distinctive feature is the ultrabasic ophiolite peridotite and gabbro on Unst and Fetlar, which are remnants of the Iapetus Ocean floor. Much of Shetland's economy depends on the oil-bearing sediments in the surrounding seas.|$|E

5|$|Aetosaur {{material}} was first described by Swiss paleontologist Louis Agassiz in 1844. He named the genus Stagonolepis from the Lossiemouth Sandstone in Elgin, Scotland, but considered {{it to be}} a Devonian fish rather than a Triassic reptile. This may be because he considered the strata {{to be part of the}} <b>Old</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sandstone,</b> and thus Paleozoic in age. Agassiz mistook the osteoderms for large rhomboidal scales, which he thought were arranged in a similar pattern to those of gars. He also thought that these supposed scales were very similar to those of the lobe-finned fish Megalichthys due to their large size.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the Mainland, most of the islands are in two groups, the North and South Isles, {{all of which have}} an underlying geological base of <b>Old</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sandstone.</b> The climate is mild and the soils are extremely fertile, most of the land being farmed. Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy. The significant wind and marine energy resources are of growing importance, and the island generates more than its total yearly electricity demand using renewables. The local people are known as Orcadians and have a distinctive dialect of Scots and a rich inheritance of folklore. There is an abundance of marine and avian wildlife.|$|E

5|$|The woods {{surrounding}} the castle, {{known as the}} Taff Gorge complex, {{are among the most}} westerly natural beech woodlands in the British Isles. They contain dog's mercury, ransoms, sanicles, bird's-nest orchid, greater butterfly-orchid and yellow bird's nest plants. The area has unusual rock outcrops, which show the point where Devonian <b>Old</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sandstone</b> and Carboniferous Limestone beds meet; the Castell Coch Quarry is in the vicinity. To the southeast of the castle, a nine-hole golf course occupies the site of the former vineyard. The area is protected as the Castell Coch Woodlands and Road Section Site of Special Scientific Interest.|$|E
