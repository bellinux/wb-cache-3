5|$|GM halted {{production}} for about one {{month at the}} Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly plant by mid June 2011 to complete some upgrades, including the installation of new tooling, equipment and <b>overhead</b> <b>conveyor</b> systems throughout the facility. These upgrades allowed GM to triple the rate of Volt production and prepared the plant for 2012 Volt and Ampera production. After the plant retooling, the production rate reached 150 units per day {{four days a week}} by August 2011. The Volt plant was also down during January 2012 in preparation for building the California lower-emission version. A four-week shutdown due to slow sales took place between March and April 2012. GM said it had around 3,600 Volts in inventory and needed to reduce dealer inventories as production is expected to meet market demand. GM also extended the traditional two-week summer vacation by an extra week at the Hamtramck plant. GM closed its Detroit-Hamtramck plant from September 17 until October 15, 2012, affecting roughly 1,500 workers on downtime while the plant was retooled to assemble the all-new 2014 Chevrolet Impala alongside the 2013 Volt. This was the second time in 2012 that GM has halted Volt production.|$|E

25|$|In {{the final}} step, the molded {{component}} and core are both demolded and the core is melted-out from the molding. This {{is done in}} a hot bath, via induction heating, or {{through a combination of}} the two. Hot baths usually use a tub filled with glycol or Lutron, which is a phenol-based liquid. The bath temperature is slightly higher than that of the core alloy’s melting point, but not so high that it damages the molding. In typical commercial applications the parts are dipped into the hot bath via an <b>overhead</b> <b>conveyor.</b> The advantage to using a hot bath is that it is simpler than induction heating and it helps cure thermoset moldings. The disadvantage is that it is uneconomically slow at a cycle time of 60 to 90 minutes and it poses environmental cleanup issues. Typically the hot bath solution needs cleaning or replacement every year or every half year when used in combination with induction heating.|$|E

5000|$|The {{increasing}} traffic {{problems in}} Berlin {{at the end}} of the 19th century led to a search for new efficient means of transport. Inspired by Werner von Siemens, numerous suggestions were made for <b>overhead</b> <b>conveyors,</b> such as a suspension railway, as was later built in Wuppertal, or a tube railway as was built in London. Finally Siemens and some prominent Berliners submitted a plan for an elevated railway on the model of New York. These people opposed Siemens' suggestion of building an overhead railway in the major street of Friedrichstrasse, but the city of Berlin opposed underground railways, since it feared damage to one of its new sewers.|$|R
50|$|Material {{handling}} {{is integral}} {{to the design of}} most production systems since the efficient flow of material between the activities of a production system is heavily dependent on the arrangement (or layout) of the activities. If two activities are adjacent to each other, then material might easily be handed from one activity to another. If activities are in sequence, a conveyor can move the material at low cost. If activities are separated, more expensive industrial trucks or <b>overhead</b> <b>conveyors</b> are required for transport. The high cost of using an industrial truck for material transport is due to both the labor costs of the operator and the negative impact on the performance of a production system (e.g., increased work in process) when multiple units of material are combined into a single transfer batch {{in order to reduce the}} number of trips required for transport.|$|R

50|$|A {{conveyor}} {{system that is}} designed properly will {{last a long time}} with proper maintenance. Here are six of the biggest problems to watch for in overhead type {{conveyor system}}s including I-beam monorails, enclosed track conveyors and power and free conveyors. <b>Overhead</b> <b>conveyor</b> systems have been used in numerous applications from shop displays, assembly lines to paint finishing plants and more.|$|E
50|$|Conveyors {{are used}} when {{material}} {{is to be}} moved frequently between specific points over a fixed path and {{when there is a}} sufficient flow volume to justify the fixed conveyor investment. Different types of conveyors can be characterized by the type of product being handled: unit load or bulk load; the conveyor’s location: in-floor, on-floor, or overhead, and whether or not loads can accumulate on the conveyor. Accumulation allows intermittent movement of each unit of material transported along the conveyor, while all units move simultaneously on conveyors without accumulation capability. For example, while both the roller and flat-belt are unit-load on-floor conveyors, the roller provides accumulation capability while the flat-belt does not; similarly, both the power-and-free and trolley are unit-load <b>overhead</b> <b>conveyors,</b> with the power-and-free designed to include an extra track in order to provide the accumulation capability lacking in the trolley conveyor. Examples of bulk-handling conveyors include the magnetic-belt, troughed-belt, bucket, and screw conveyors. A sortation conveyor system is used for merging, identifying, inducting, and separating products to be conveyed to specific destinations, and typically consists of flat-belt, roller, and chute conveyor segments together with various moveable arms and/or pop-up wheels and chains that deflect, push, or pull products to different destinations.|$|R
5000|$|The sugar {{storage shed}} was {{constructed}} in 1923. An electrical conveyor system was installed in the shed to move sugar bags to and from ships' holds and railway wagons, and was fully operational by 1926. The system consisted of an inclined covered conveyor extending from railway tracks {{on the west side}} of the shed up to the shed's roofline. This conveyor provided the linkage with the wharf railway system. A complicated set of conveyors and chutes was built into the roof of the sugar shed, and this system was used to stack bagged sugar at a rate of up to 80 tons per hour. A second conveyor extended between the roof of the sugar shed eastwards to the roof of number 4 wharf shed. This conveyor joined another in a T-configuration on the eastern side of the wharf shed's roof. The <b>overhead</b> <b>conveyors</b> from White's Shed to number 3 wharf were reconstructed in 1946, while maintenance and repairs to both [...] "shore and floating plant" [...] were made in 1947. The 27-year-old facility was apparently modernised during the overhaul. Two travelling gantry cranes moved up and down the number 4 wharf's edge, loading and unloading the sugar bags into ship's holds via a set of conveyors mounted on the gantry cranes and connected to the T-conveyor.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} was exposed the tendences of the most {{important}} designers and producers of integrated transportation sistems. The transportation system is one {{of the most important}} problem in the garments fabrication economy. Beginning from unprocessed goods,cutting area,process management,finishing area,quality check to the warehouse, distribution and dispatch zone the basic idea was the same: unlimited railing from centrally-suspended rail servicing all kinds of work stations with application specific trolleys. Ergonomic work station design, linking work stations and areas, manual, semi-automatic and automatic, modular set ups lead to intralogistic systems for the entire factory. The articles are transported from a post to another post by a suspended trolley. The system for apparel industries is a flexible material handling system designed to eliminate manual transportation and minimize handling. It increases productivity radically, ensures an optimal working flow and provides time for adding value to your products. Technically the system consists of <b>overhead</b> <b>conveyors</b> with individually addressable product carriers, automatically finding its way to the correct operation. It is monitored by a computer providing all necessary data for measuring and managing the process optimally. Furthermore, the system is highly flexible and can rapidly be modified to changes in the production line or the need for expansion. In the same time introduce foreign technology, research and develop independently from hardware to software,. customize the special need of the customers and upgrade and expand the function easily...|$|R
