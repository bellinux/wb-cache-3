5|$|After being {{disgusted with}} the state of the Square and {{learning}} that a councillor has stood down, Peggy and Pat both decide to run for council and are interviewed by journalist Harvey Freeman (Martin Jarvis). Eventually they both pull out of the election, but Harvey hears of this and individually invites them both out. They both finally discover his two-timing, and humiliate him in punishment. When Phil prevents his daughter Louise (Brittany Papple) from contacting her mother Lisa (Lucy Benjamin), Peggy interjects and Phil punches her. Believing he is an unfit parent, Peggy takes Louise to Lisa against Phil's wishes. Although, Lisa promises to allow Phil visitation, she flees with Louise. Phil blames Peggy for the loss of his child and begins using alcohol and crack cocaine. Peggy tries to stop Phil using crack by locking him in her pub, but Phil escapes and in a drunken bid for revenge, he sets fire to Peggy's pub. Peggy watches in horror as it is destroyed. Realising her role in Phil's problems, Peggy decides to leave Walford for his sake. After saying tearful goodbyes to her family and making peace with Phil, Peggy takes <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> The Queen Vic and leaves Albert Square.|$|E
25|$|In the 2003 revival {{starring}} Bernadette Peters, {{the final}} dialogue scene remains, but leaves the ending open to more interpretation from the audience. Louise {{walks through the}} stage door, with Rose following behind. Rose then turns to face the audience, a look of sadness and longing on {{her face as she}} takes <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the empty stage. She pauses and slowly closes the door.|$|E
500|$|Nick Campbell of TV.com {{felt that}} the episode was [...] "a decent if uneven {{penultimate}} episode that gave us <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> this quirky {{group of people in}} their office environment". He was largely happy with the return of the fun-loving version of Jim, noting that [...] "Pam mentioned that she loves 'Goofy Jim' and I, [...] have to admit, I love Goofy Jim myself". Campbell {{felt that the}} episode dabbled in fan service, but that it was expected and needed for the show to have a successful ending. Roth Cornet of IGN awarded the episode an 8.5 out of 10, denoting a [...] "great" [...] episode. She wrote that [...] "The interplay between Jim, Dwight, and Pam has been the core of the series since Michael Scott's departure, and it was good to see the trio front and center once again as The Office comes to a close." [...] Furthermore, Cornet was happy with Dwight's proposal and the dance party that signaled Darryl's leaving, calling the latter [...] "a slice of bliss".|$|E
60|$|The train passed {{smoothly}} {{out of the}} station. Sally cast <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> back <b>at</b> her red-haired friend, who had now halted and {{was waving}} a handkerchief. Then she turned to apologize to the other occupant of the carriage.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will come}} Friday evening, Uncle Jethro," [...] she said, as {{she kissed him}} and gave <b>one</b> <b>last,</b> {{lingering}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his face. Had it been possible, {{she would not have}} left him, and on her way to Brampton through the gathering darkness she mused anxiously upon that strange calmness he had shown after defeat.|$|R
60|$|The {{meal was}} all over in an {{incredibly}} short time. One by one, two by two, they rose heavily and lumbered out with <b>one</b> <b>last</b> wistful <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Mrs. Field. She will never know how seraphic she seemed sitting there amid those rough surroundings--the dim red light of the kerosene lamp falling across her clear pallor, out of which her dark eyes shone with liquid softness, made deeper and darker by her half-sorrowful tenderness for these homeless fellows.|$|R
500|$|Jim (John Krasinski) deduces {{over the}} course of the day that Michael is leaving early and confronts him about it. Michael admits his plans, and begins a {{personal}} goodbye, but breaks down after a few words. Jim, trying to hold back tears, in turn says how much he respects Michael, and that Michael was the best boss he ever had and they jokingly promise to have a proper goodbye over lunch the next day. Michael's cab to the airport then arrives, and Michael departs the office after <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the employees, exiting silently. His cab pulls out of the parking lot just as Pam is pulling in. At the airport, Michael asks the camera crew to inform him if the documentary ever airs, then turns over his microphone, quipping one last [...] "That's what she said" [...] about how good it will feel to [...] "get this thing [...] off [...] chest". He begins to walk off when Pam makes it past security and runs up to him. They hug twice and say goodbyes that are not heard by the camera. Pam says in an interview that Michael was not sad, that he was hopeful and excited to start his new life with Holly. Pam stands at the gate and watches Michael's plane take off.|$|E
2500|$|Alice {{arrives and}} takes the wine, and sees through Annabel's offer almost immediately. With Annabel refusing to offer any more, Miriam, in {{apparent}} desperation, suggests Lewis could find the money. Alice scorns this too, and, before leaving {{to go to the}} Police, stops to tell Miriam has one hell of a sister ... but before she can finish, she collapses. Miriam says she drugged the wine (her own glass having come from a different bottle in the kitchen), and a horrified Annabel watches her push Alice's body through the trapdoor and down the well. Next, she goes through Alice's handbag looking for the letter. It is not there, but her address and keys are, so she persuades Annabel to come with her to get the letter. Before Annabel leaves, she takes <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the tennis court, a tennis ball flies out of nowhere, and she screams.|$|E
60|$|Her {{face was}} white and her eyes terror-stricken. She obeyed him mechanically. She gave <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> those bodies....|$|E
60|$|All {{this being}} done, Beatrice visited {{the kitchen and}} ordered the supper. She went further in her {{innocent}} cunning. Betty {{asked her what she}} would like for breakfast on the following morning, and she told her to cook some bacon, and to be careful how she cut it, as she did not like thick bacon. Then, after <b>one</b> long <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the Vicarage, she started for the lodging of the head teacher of the school, and, having found her, inquired as to the day's work.|$|R
6000|$|And {{fighting}} {{the battle of}} life is fighting against fearful odds, too. There are giants and dragons in this nineteenth century, and the golden casket that they guard {{is not so easy}} to win as it appears in the story-books. There, Algernon takes <b>one</b> long, <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the ancestral hall, dashes the tear-drop from his eye, and goes off--to return in three years' time, rolling in riches. The authors do not tell us [...] "how it's done," [...] which is a pity, for it would surely prove exciting.|$|R
60|$|Captain Truck {{had never}} before been so deeply {{impressed}} with any religious ceremony, and when it ceased he looked wistfully over the side at the spot where the body had fallen, or where it might be supposed to have fallen--- for the ship had drifted some distance--as <b>one</b> takes a <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the grave of a friend.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly Wetzel's terrible temptation, his heart-racking {{struggle}} ceased. He {{lowered the}} long, black rifle. He took <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the chieftain's dark, powerful face.|$|E
60|$|Harding hesitated. He glanced savagely at Smoke, saw Pierre beckoning to Louis {{from the}} doorway, took <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the lump-gold on the table, and decided.|$|E
60|$|Sonorous and startling {{came the}} stroke of 9 from the clock tower. The young man sighed again, turned his face for <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the house of his relinquished hopes--and cried aloud profane words of holy rapture.|$|E
5000|$|On November 13, 1967, <b>One</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Look</b> premiered off-off-Broadway <b>at</b> the Old Reliable Theatre Tavern {{under the}} {{direction}} of Arthur French. It is a dark comedy set during the funeral of a family patriarch. [...] It features the character of Eustace Baylor, that would later be found in his play, Eden, the first of a trilogy of plays featuring Caribbean families in New York City.|$|R
60|$|The sudden, {{intolerable}} {{sense of}} wrong {{done to her}} love, the swift anger which followed it, the justness of her claim of him who now lay in the dignity of death clothed her--who in life had been crushed and blotted out--with a dignity not to be gainsaid. In this moment of final self-assertion she became the dominating person in the room, knew for once the birthright of human worth. They watched her in silence as she turned and gave <b>one</b> <b>last,</b> lingering <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{the features of the}} dead; stretched out her hand towards them, but did not touch them... and then went slowly towards the door. Beside Alison she stopped.|$|R
5000|$|The Yangs {{now believe}} Kirk is a deity and Cloud kneels before him, but Kirk refutes this {{and tells him}} to stand up. He looks over the ancient, {{crumbling}} document, {{which appears to be}} a version of the American Constitution. Kirk finishes the sacred speech (the Preamble to the United States Constitution) and rebukes the Yangs for allowing the document to degrade. He declares that the words were not just for the Yangs, but for Kohms, as well, declaring that they [...] "must apply to everyone or they mean nothing." [...] Cloud doesn't fully understand, but swears to Kirk that the [...] "holy words" [...] will be obeyed. Before departing, Kirk takes <b>one</b> <b>last</b> proud <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Old Glory.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't bother about me!" [...] Harry replied; {{and then}} as the flames came nearer he plunged into the sea, Joe {{lingering}} a few seconds longer, as if to take <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the little craft he had {{tried so hard to}} save.|$|E
60|$|As the cavalcade {{turned the}} corner of the mountain, they paused for <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the scene of that fearful triumph. Lines of {{vultures}} were already streaming out of infinite space, as if created suddenly for the occasion. A few hours {{and there would be no}} trace of that fierce fray, but a few white bones amid untrodden beds of flowers.|$|E
60|$|As {{he passed}} over the {{drawbridge}} and down toward the highroad {{a few minutes later}} {{on his way back to}} Torn, he turned for <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the castle and there, in an embrasure in the south tower, stood a young woman who raised her hand to wave, and then, as though by sudden impulse, threw a kiss after the departing knight, only to disappear from the embrasure with the act.|$|E
6000|$|Then the Mulla-mulgars {{cut down}} stout boughs to make cudgels, and, having tied up their few {{possessions}} into three bundles and filled their pockets with old nuts, they took palm-leaves and honey-comb and withered scarlet and green berries, {{with which they}} canopied {{as best they could}} their mother's grave, nor forgot poor gluttonous Glint's. They stood there in the snow, and raised their hands in lamentable salutation. And each took up a stone and jerked it (for they cannot throw as men do) {{as far as he could}} towards the forest, as if to say, [...] "Go with us!" [...] Then, with <b>one</b> <b>last</b> sorrowful <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the befrosted ashes of their hut, they took up their bundles and started on their journey.|$|R
6000|$|His lips {{touched my}} lips, pressed them, dwelt on them--oh, how can I tell of it! Some new enchantment of feeling ran deliciously {{through and through}} me. I forgot my own self; I only knew of {{one person in the}} world. He was master of my lips; he was master of my heart. When he whispered, [...] "kiss me," [...] I kissed. What a moment it was! A faintness stole over me; I felt as if I was going to die some {{exquisite}} death; I laid myself back away from him--I was not able to speak. There was no need for it; my thoughts and his thoughts were one--he knew that I was quite overcome; he saw that he must leave me to recover myself alone. I pointed to the shrubbery gate. We took <b>one</b> long <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> each other for that day; the trees hid him; I was left by myself.|$|R
60|$|Therefore, after {{summoning}} Tarifa at {{the head}} of his 5,000 Moors, he led forth before the gates the boy who had been confided to his care, and declared that unless the city were yielded instantly, Guzman should behold the death of his own son at his hand! Before, he had had to deal with a weak woman on a question of divided allegiance. It was otherwise here. The point was whether the city should be made over to the enemies of the faith and country, whether the plighted word of a loyal knight should be broken. The boy was held in the grasp of the cruel prince, stretching out his hands and weeping as he saw his father upon the walls. Don Alonso's eyes, we are told, filled with tears as he cast <b>one</b> long, <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his first-born, whom he might not save except at the expense of his truth and honor.|$|R
60|$|Not {{till they}} reached {{the opening of the}} gorge did they stop to rest and take <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the valley. The {{tremendous}} arch of stone curved clear and sharp in outline against the morning sky. And through it streaked the golden shaft. The valley seemed an enchanted circle of glorious veils of gold and wraiths of white and silver haze and dim, blue, moving shade--beautiful and wild and unreal as a dream.|$|E
6000|$|Then I crept out in {{the dark}} [...] Till I hung above the hatch [...] Of the [...] "Serapis,"--a mark [...] For her marksmen!--with a match [...] And a hand-grenade, but lingered just a moment more to snatch [...] <b>One</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> sea and sky!

[...] Then turned and down her yawning throat I launched that devil's pill! ...|$|E
60|$|Polly Ann did, and generously,--the salt {{they had}} carried {{with so much}} labor threescore and ten miles from the settlements. Then we took our departure, the girl turning for <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Tom's mother, and at the cabin where he had dwelt. We were all silent {{the rest of the}} way, {{climbing}} the slender trail through the forest over the gap into the next valley. For I was jealous of Tom. I am not ashamed to own it now.|$|E
60|$|What {{would you}} have done then, reader? I didn't. In my great moment I had {{strength}} of character to raise my hat for the third time and walk away, leaving the child to judge between us. I walked slowly, for I knew I must give him time to get it out, and I listened eagerly, but that was unnecessary, for when it did come it was a very roar of anguish. I turned my head, and saw David fiercely pushing the woman aside, that he might have <b>one</b> <b>last</b> long <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me. He held out his wistful arms and nodded repeatedly, and I faltered, but my glorious scheme saved me, and I walked on. It was a scheme conceived in a flash, and ever since relentlessly pursued, to burrow under Mary's influence with the boy, expose her to him in all her vagaries, take him utterly from her and make him mine.|$|R
500|$|In New York City, Carl {{presents}} [...] "Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World" [...] on Broadway, starring Baxter and an imprisoned Kong. Ann {{is played}} by an anonymous chorus girl, and Kong becomes enraged after realizing that the girl on stage is not Ann. After breaking free from his chrome-steel chains, he wrecks the theater and chases Jack. Kong knocks Jack out by stopping his car and flipping it, then encounters Ann again. Kong and Ann share a moment on a frozen pond in Central Park until the army attacks. Kong climbs with Ann onto {{the top of the}} Empire State Building, where he fights off six F8C-5 Helldiver Navy planes, downing three. At the end of the confrontation, Kong is mortally wounded by the gunfire and gazes at Ann for the last time before falling from the building to his death. As Ann is reunited with Jack, civilians, photographers, police and soldiers gather around Kong's corpse. Carl makes his way through the crowd, takes <b>one</b> <b>last</b> long <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Kong and says, [...] "It wasn't the airplanes. It was Beauty killed the Beast." ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{performances}} {{of a young}} artistic company called Divadlo F. X. Kalby which has been founded as an unofficial branch of a Liberec theatre Divadlo F. X. Šaldy. The ambition of my work {{is to create a}} complex portrait of the ensemble, therefore the text is divided into three parts. The first part describes the beginnings of the artistic company Divadlo F. X. Kalby and characterizes it in general. The second part is about creative work and performances of this theatre group and the <b>last</b> <b>one</b> is <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> it's typical audience. In this section I am trying to find out how the ensemble communicates with the audience and in which ways it attracts the spectators. I captured the presented information of my work via interviews with actors, from internet and news reviews, from the book 'DIVADLO FXKALBY' (published by photographer and journalist Roman Dobeš), from plays and records provided by the company, through my own questionnaire placed on Facebook and sent by emails, and finally from the discussion with dramaturge Šaldas theatre Michal Syrovátka. I have compared acquired material with professional literature which is oriented on contemporary theatre forms. Keywords: Theatre F. X. Kalby, regional theatre, theatre of generation, performances, spectato...|$|R
60|$|Then {{he remembered}} {{something}} more. He {{took hold of}} the right arm. He was convinced that it had been broken during that desperate struggle in the darkness. He felt it carefully and listened. He heard plainly the two parts of the bone rub against one another. The dead man's arm was broken just in the place where he had broken it. Arthur stood up. He took <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his enemy. That vast mass of flesh lay heaped up on the floor in horrible disorder.|$|E
60|$|So {{much this}} little natural park of Aripo taught, or seemed to teach me. But I {{did not learn}} {{the whole of the}} lesson that afternoon, or indeed till long after. There was no time then to work out such theories. The sun was getting low, and more {{intolerable}} as he sank; and to escape a sunstroke on the spot, or at least a dark ride home, we hurried off into the forest shade, after <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the never-to-be-forgotten Morichal, and trotted home to luxury and sleep.|$|E
60|$|And now we {{gathered}} up the great gems, and such of the ornaments as might be carried with ease, and I hid them as many as I could, {{in the folds of}} my robe. Those that were left Cleopatra hid upon her breast. Heavily laden with the priceless treasure, we gave <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the solemn place, at the sarcophagus and the Sphinx on which it rested, whose gleaming face of calm seemed to mock us with its everlasting smile of wisdom. Then we turned and went from the tomb.|$|E
