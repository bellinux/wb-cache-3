25|$|The classic fibula of the late-Roman era, and in {{fact the}} best known of all fibula types, is the {{crossbow}} type. The crossbow fibula consists of a highly arched semi-circular bow, usually of squarish cross-section, and a long flat foot. The fibula has a wide transverse bar (or arms) at the head containing the pin-hinge. Crossbow fibulae usually have three round <b>or</b> <b>onion-shaped</b> knobs: one at the head and one {{at each end of the}} transverse bar.|$|E
25|$|Many abbeys of France, {{such as that}} at Cluny, {{had many}} towers of varied forms. This is also common in Germany, where the apses were {{sometimes}} framed with circular towers and the crossing surmounted by an octagonal tower as at Worms Cathedral. Large paired towers of square plan could also occur on the transept ends, such as those at Tournai Cathedral in Belgium. In Germany, where four towers frequently occur, they often have spires that may be four or eight sided, or the distinctive Rhenish helm shape seen on the cathedrals of Limburg or Speyer. It is also common to see bell <b>or</b> <b>onion-shaped</b> spires of the Baroque period surmounting Romanesque towers in central and Eastern Europe.|$|E
500|$|Depictions of kitsune {{or their}} possessed victims may feature round <b>or</b> <b>onion-shaped</b> white balls known as [...] Tales {{describe}} these as glowing with kitsunebi. Some stories identify them as magical jewels or pearls. When not in human form or possessing a human, a kitsune keeps {{the ball in}} its mouth or carries it on its tail. Jewels are a common symbol of Inari, and representations of sacred Inari foxes without them are rare.|$|E
50|$|The main chamber is {{rectangular}} {{and made}} of black brick. It is 4.2 meters north-south, 2.72 meters east-west, and 3.14 meters (4.2 * 2.72 * 3.14 m) in height. While {{the north and south}} walls stand straight, the east and west walls curve inward, creating an arched roof. The south wall has an arch-shaped door which leads to a passageway and entrance of the tomb. The door is 2.9 meters in length, 1.04 meters in width, and 1.45 meters in height (2.9 * 1.04 * 1.45 m). The east and west walls have two <b>onion-shaped</b> <b>or</b> flame-shaped niches to hold lamps while the north wall has one such niche. The placement of the bricks of the tomb are in alternating rows of lengthwise and widthwise arrangements. The bricks mainly have lotus motifs but other decorations were incorporated as well.|$|R

5000|$|Minaret ( [...] ; مناره , minare,), from منارة , [...] "lighthouse", {{also known}} as Goldaste (گلدسته), is a {{distinctive}} architectural structure akin to a tower and typically found adjacent to mosques. Generally a tall spire with a conical <b>or</b> <b>onion-shaped</b> crown, usually either free-standing or taller than associated support structure. The basic form of a minaret includes a base, shaft, and gallery. Styles vary regionally and by period. Minarets provide a visual focal point and are traditionally used for the Muslim call to prayer.|$|E

40|$|Many {{aspects of}} the {{reproductive}} anatomy and physiology of tettigoniids have been studied extensively. These include the large, externally visible spermatophores and the bundles of sperm, known as spermatodesms. However, spermatodoses, spermatophore-like structures found within the spermatheca, {{seem to have been}} almost completely overlooked: their structure has not been described since 1913 and they have subsequently received only passing mention in the literature. Each time the female mates, a separate spermatodose is formed. Here I use photographs, from light-microscopy, of whole and sectioned spermatodoses to describe the external and internal structure of spermatodoses of nine different genera within the subfamily Tettigoniinae. The structure of the spermatodoses is very similar for the different genera. Each spermatodose is pear- <b>or</b> <b>onion-shaped</b> and consists of a thin outer layer, enclosing a thick, gelatinous inner layer. A large sperm mass occupies the bulbous end of the spermatodose, while a thin sperm-tube leads from the sperm mass, along the center of the elongated neck of the spermatodose, and appears to exit at the pointed-tip of the spermatodose. Feather-like bundles of sperm (spermatodesms) were clearly visible within the sperm mass and also appeared to be present within the sperm-tube. The wall of the sperm tube appeared to be composed of material {{similar to that of the}} outer layer of the spermatodose. Within the spermatheca, spermatodoses appeared to be stratified in that only one of them ever occupied the position nearest to the spermathecal duct. The possible function of spermatodoses is discussed: it is proposed that they have evolved as a result of sexual conflict and function to protect the sperm from being destroyed by the female while they are in storage...|$|E
