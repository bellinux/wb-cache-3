40|$|Fusarium oxysporum {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pathogens which cause wilt in many economically important crops. Fusarial wilt of banana, commonly known as Panama disease of banana, became epidemic in Panama as early as 1890. The Panama disease of banana caused by F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense (E. F. Smith) Snyder & Hansen is a potentially devastating disease throughout the world and the major limiting factor for banana production. The goal of this research is to develop a rapid, simple, and reliable identification method for the fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (FOC). The developed PCR methods could be applied to other Races of FOC in addition to Foc Race 4 of Taiwan origin or all FOC races. FOC isolates and other formae speciales of F. oxysporum (affecting crops <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>bananas)</b> and other Fusarium spp. will be collected from different geographic locations in Taiwan. One of the principal investigators (PI), Dr. C. P. Chao, will provide FOC isolates in his collections and do pathogenicity test with banana plantlets. The other PI, Dr. P. -F. L. Chang, in addition to collect FOC isolates and do pathogenicity test with banana plantlets, has developed a microwave method for rapid genomic DNA extraction from fungal mycelia and establish a specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for rapid FOC identification. This technique will be used for detecting pathogen in plant diseased tissues and soils in the future. In addition, the PIs will collaborate with Dr. Peter P. Ueng of USDA-ARS, Beltsville, Maryland, USA to obtain the available type cultures of all FOC races (Races 1, 2, and 4) in US. In the future, the rapid identification technique will be further developed to apply for the detection of F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense pathogen in soils and plant tissues. This will help to control the world-wide important wilt disease of banana. The developed platform technology will be further used for molecular identification and detection of the Fusarium wilt pathogens of other economically important crops. 尖鐮孢菌為造成許多重要經濟作物萎凋之病原。其中由Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense引起之香蕉黃葉病為全世界香蕉栽培的主要限制因子，不僅在台灣肆虐蔓延，導致台灣香蕉嚴重減產，也在巴拿馬及中美洲各地造成嚴重的經濟損失。由於尖鐮孢菌可形成厚膜孢子殘存於土壤或植物殘株，病原菌一旦經由土壤、種苗、農機具與車輛、灌溉水或人員傳入處女地則無法根除，防治不易。因此開發快速檢測技術，有效制止病原菌的傳播，實為當務之急。本年度將自台灣主要香蕉產區蒐集香蕉黃葉病菌菌株，並進行病原性測試；同時也將蒐集感染其他作物之鐮孢菌屬菌株；另一方面藉美國農部分子植物病理學專家—翁溥博士之協助購買香蕉黃葉病菌各生理小種之標準菌株，並以純培養方式維持其生長以供後續DNA萃取及PCR分析用，並將利用修正過的微波爐法以快速萃取少量菌絲之DNA，並將此技術應用於香蕉黃葉病菌之檢測上。此外，也將利用「增幅片段長度多型性」（AFLP）及「隨機增幅多型性核酸」（RAPD）等分析來篩選具生理小種專一性之核酸指紋標記（DNA marker），並由美國農部翁溥博士協助DNA指紋圖譜（fingerprinting）之分析。本計畫之最終成果為開發一套PCR檢測流程，能快速、簡便且可靠的進行香蕉黃葉病菌不同生理小種之鑑別工作，未來更可進一步應用於偵測土壤及植物組織中的病原菌，期望對於香蕉黃葉病之防治工作有所助益。以此發展技術為平台，也可應用於開發其他重要經濟作物之鐮孢萎凋病菌的分子鑑定及檢測技術...|$|E

40|$|Cue: When we {{talk about}} {{agricultural}} biotechnology, most people assume that we mean genetic modification - breeding new characteristics into plants and animals by manipulating their genes, sometimes even transferring genes from one species to another. This kind of biotechnology has raised fears among some about the damage that may result to the environment or to human health. However, other technologies are less controversial. For example, certain tissue culture techniques are already being used in African countries to genetically clean up planting material, such as seeds. In Kenya the National Federation of Agricultural Producers {{is involved in a}} project to supply clean planting material for traditional food crops in a number of pilot districts. The Federation?s Chief Executive, Mercy Karanja, explained to Eric Kadenge why she feels this kind of biotechnology is of great importance to small scale farmers. IN:		?Biotechnology is a science ?? OUT:		?? suffered very many problems. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 04 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mercy Karanja of the Kenya National Federation of Agricultural Producers. Transcript Karanja	Biotechnology is a science like any other and there is a place for science in our life so we must emphasise that biotechnology is trying to solve and give us solutions to some niche problems which we have. For example in the area of bananas, {{we had a lot of}} problems with nematodes. We couldn't get cleaning planting materials for bananas, so biotechnology has come in and given us a solution. So there is a space for biotechnology which is very critical and we have seen a lot of assistance especially to the small scale farmers through clean seed provision. That?s the main thing we have seen this far Kadenge	<b>Other</b> <b>than</b> <b>bananas,</b> do you have any other examples of crops that are being improved through the use of biotechnology? Karanja	Yes, we've done a lot of work in the sweet potato vines in Kakamega, improving the nutritive value of sweet potatoes and since it?s a staple food for the people in that region of this country, its very important that we are able to improve. That has happened and we are very grateful about that. There's also work on drought resistant maize and also maize that is also resistant to streak virus. I think these are some of the greatest breakthroughs we would ever be able to have in this country. Kadenge	Have you been able to get some of the feelings from the farmers about these whole developments? Karanja	Everything that has been done has come from the farmers. It was a study that was done. We went and found out what are the critical problems which are affecting farmers in different regions, and what was done is the key thing that the farmer requested. For example, the banana problem: the bananas were being wiped out by nematodes and now you can see livelihoods being transformed. So we have really documented very exciting cases. Exciting cases especially of bananas, citrus, cassava, and this is food for people, besides an income as food for the households. So all this work has been documented and we are very glad to see the kind of impact it has on the ground. Kadenge	Now if I was a small-scale farmer wondering if I should at all consider using some of these products, what reasons would you give me to do so? Karanja	I would only say where you have a real critical problem like you don't have good clean seed to plant for example like for cassava, go for what is available. It has been cleansed and the kind of biotechnology we are talking about is really the traditional biotechnology of tissue culture. It's not like developing a whole new plant all together, which is going on in other parts of the world. We are still very basically at the traditional level where it is not highly risky to develop the plants out of their own tissues. So we can't say we will not use biotechnology like has been tried to be done by some of the groups. We are saying, let us use it where we need it. We need our traditional seeds, we need biotechnology to solve these very peculiar problems we have of disease and drought, of unclean planting materials. So let?s get what we can use now and allow the scientists to continue doing research, to see whether there are some other side effects. Kadenge	Is there anything else that you would like to add? Karanja	Yes I would really urge our scientists to continue giving us the information because that is what is the problem. If the farmers are not informed and given the whole spectrum of information, then they are bound to be vulnerable to other people coming with different gospels. But what we need to be armed with is information of where we are, where we are going and what is happening. There's a lot more biotechnology going on in this country, let it be out there for public consumption so that people can be able to dialogue concerning it very honestly and very seriously. If we can have solutions for our traditional foods, that is what we need to build in this country so that people can have their sorghums and their millets and their cassavas and their sweet potatoes on the table. Then we are able to develop the agricultural sector which has suffered very many problems. End of Track.

40|$|Conversion {{of native}} {{rainforest}} ecosystems in Limón Province of Costa Rica to banana and pineapple monoculture {{has led to}} reductions in biodiversity and soil quality. Agroforestry management of cacao (Theobroma cacao) is an alternative system that may maintain the agricultural livelihood of the region while more closely mimicking native ecosystems. This study compared physical, biological and chemical soil quality indicators of a cacao plantation under organic agroforestry management with banana, pineapple, and pasture systems; a native forest nearby served as a control. For bulk density and earthworm analysis, 18 samples were collected between March and April 2012 from each ecosystem paired with 18 samples from the cacao. Cacao had a lower bulk density <b>than</b> <b>banana</b> and pineapple monocultures, but greater than the forest (p< 0. 05). Cacao also hosted a greater number and mass of earthworms <b>than</b> <b>banana</b> and pineapple (p< 0. 05), but similar to forest and pasture. For soil chemical characteristics, three composite samples were collected in March 2012 from each agroecosystem paired with three samples from the cacao plantation. Forest and pineapple ecosystems had the lowest pH, cation exchange capacity, and exchangeable nutrient cations, while cacao had the greatest (p< 0. 05). Total nutrient levels of P and N were slightly greater in banana, pineapple and pasture than in cacao; probably related to addition of chemical fertilizer and manure from cattle grazing. Forest and cacao also had greater %C, <b>than</b> <b>other</b> ecosystems, which {{is directly related to}} soil organic matter content (p< 0. 0001). Overall, cacao had more favorable physical, biological and chemical soil characteristics <b>than</b> <b>banana</b> and pineapple monocultures, while trends were less conclusive compared to the pastureland. While organic cacao was inferior to native forest in some soil characteristics such as bulk density and organic carbon, its soil quality did best mimic that of the native forest. This supports the organic cultivation of cacao as a desirable alternative to banana and pineapple monoculture...|$|R

Five samples conducted in this research by varying the banana skin loading, which are 0 %, 5 %, 10 %, 15 % and 20 %. Lowry method is been used to measures total protein content. Result showed that protein content in NRL film increase with the banana skin loading. The highest protein content found to be latex film treated with 15 % of banana skin loading. Based on the ASTM recommends their standards for medical gloves that all examination and surgical gloves should contains less than 200. tg/dm 2, latex film treated with banana skin need undergoes proper leaching during the process of production to reduce the extractable protein (EP) content. For mechanical properties, dumbbell shaped samples are cut from the mould sheets according to ASTM D 412. Tensile strength increased up to 10 % filler loading. Further increase in filler loading after 10 % resulted in a reduction of tensile properties. While for tensile modulus, MlOO, M 300 and M 500 increased with the filler loading.

This information is crucial for choosing the best strategy for growing cocoa in tropical landscapes while conserving biodiversity and enhancing ecosystem services. We analyzed the contribution of cocoa agroforestry farming to the incomes and domestic consumption of small farmers¿ families in 179 cocoa agroforestry systems (CAFS) (254 ha) in five Central American countries. The two hypotheses were: (1) agroforestry products {{are as important as}} cocoa in contributing to livelihoods, (2) the typology of CAFS determines the relationships between socioeconomic indicators and yield, biodiversity, and structure of the shade canopy, as well as the relationships between plant species richness and cocoa yield. We quantified the yields of agroforestry products and their contribution to net income, cash flow, and family benefits and developed a typology of CAFS production to evaluate relationships for each CAFS cluster. The main agroforestry products <b>other</b> <b>than</b> cocoa were <b>bananas,</b> oranges, peach palm, other fruits, and timber, which generated modest cash incomes but high VDC at low cash costs, thus contributing to family savings and food security. Timber volumes and harvest rates were low but significant increase was deemed feasible. The contribution of the set of agroforestry products to family benefits was similar or higher than cocoa, depending on the typology of the CAFS. Intensified highly diverse-dense CAFS demonstrated remarkably higher yields, net income, cash flow, and family benefits, and had more synergetic relationships than extensive CAFS and traditional highly diverse-dense CAFS, which showed more trade-offs. Our findings point to intensified highly diverse-dense CAFS as feasible for farming within a land-sparing strategy. Further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms that could regulate synergies or trade-offs to improve this type of intensification. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

This document presents the opinion of the Panel on Plant Health on the full[2] pest risk assessment conducted by France on Ralstonia solanacearum race 2 with French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion considered as endangered area. Ralstonia solanacearum (Smith, 1896) Yabuuchi et al., 1996 race 2 is the causal agent of a lethal disease of dessert banana (Musa spp.), plantain (Musa spp.) and Heliconia spp. plants known as Moko bacterial wilt. It is also the cause of a fruit rot of the cooking banana cultivars ‘Cardaba’ and ‘Saba’ (ABB genome) in the Philippines known as bugtok or tapurok. The Panel examined in detail the risk assessment provided, and considered the accuracy and quality of the information provided and methods applied for pest risk assessment purposes. The review was based on the principles and terminology of the International Standard on Phytosanitary Measures ISPM No. 11 [3]: Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests including analysis of environmental risks and living modified organisms (2004) by the International Plant Protection Convention (FAO, 2007 b). The Panel observes that:*The pest risk assessment does not provide sufficient information to justify the conclusions reached. Specific statements and background information, though accurate, are not substantiated by scientific evidence and no references are provided on these aspects. Moreover, a number of estimates in Part 2 (pest risk assessment) are not justified or substantiated by the information provided in Part 1 of the document. *The probabilities of entry, establishment and spread and the potential impacts of R. solanacearum race 2 in the PRA area[4] should have been assessed separately for each of the French overseas departments, due to their specificities related to their geographic location and the differing importance of the host plants in each of the departments. Furthermore, the new situation in the PRA area, in case the current phytosanitary regulations governing the imports of banana plant material are lifted, should have been taken into account in the document. *In addition to the conventional banana plant propagation material and the vitroplants pathways assessed in the document, the movement of ornamental Heliconia plants and plant parts, of banana fruit and soil, the private individuals carrying infected plant material and the natural spread via insects, birds, etc. pathways should have been also considered and assessed in the document in terms of importance and risk. The Panel concludes that:*The probability of entry, under the current regulations, of R. solanacearum race 2 on Musa and ornamental Heliconia plant propagation material (<b>other</b> <b>than</b> vitroplants), <b>banana</b> fruit and soil would be low for French Guiana, Guadeloupe and Martinique due to their proximity to contaminated areas and very low for Réunion due to its great distance from the areas of the pathogen’s present distribution. Nevertheless, should the current regulations governing the imports of Musa and Heliconia plant material be lifted, and in agreement with the document, the probability of entry of the pathogen on Musa and ornamental Heliconia plant propagation material (<b>other</b> <b>than</b> vitroplants), <b>banana</b> fruit and soil would be high for French Guiana, Guadeloupe and Martinique and moderate for Réunion. The Panel considers that the probability of R. solanacearum race 2 being associated with the vitroplants pathway is negligible. *The probability of establishment of R. solanacearum race 2 in the PRA area is high, as (i) susceptible hosts are grown in the PRA area, (ii) the climatic conditions in the French overseas departments are mainly tropical and therefore, similar to those in areas of the pathogen’s present distribution, and (iii) control measures (e. g. sanitation, disinfection of tools, de-budding, inflorescence bagging, etc) {{are not likely to be}} undertaken in smallholdings and private gardens grown with Musa and Heliconia plants. *The probability of the pathogen spread after establishment is high for all French overseas departments and especially in areas with Musa and Heliconia plants grown in private gardens, where control practices are not usually undertaken due to their cost. *Within commercial plantations of dessert bananas the disease effects would be largely mitigated by existing practices of de-budding and bagging. However, additional sanitation measures would be necessary at extra costs. With the possibility of continuous re-infestation from the environment (smallholdings, weeds, wild host plants), the production costs would be structurally increased. The additional control costs may reduce the competitiveness of the banana industry in Guadeloupe and Martinique. As a result, employment may be reduced causing negative social impacts. *Plantains and other cooking bananas are an important staple food and a large fraction is household-produced. Since the disease is not readily controllable in smallholdings and private gardens, high yield losses and a potential disruption of subsistence production and consumption patterns would occur. This may also cause negative social impacts. Similar effects are envisaged for French Guiana, where the banana crop is an element of shifting cultivation. *·Uncertainties of a moderate degree are related to (i) the characterization and classification of the R. solanacearum strains recently detected in Martinique on Anthurium spp., cucurbits, tomato, Heliconia and several weeds, (ii) the ability of the pathogen to spread in the environment from fruit waste, as there is lack of information on this aspect in the literature, (iii) the banana cultivars grown in French overseas departments (<b>other</b> <b>than</b> Cavendish) and their flower bract phenology, that may influence the establishment and spread of the pathogen in the PRA area, (iv) the level of the cost increase in commercial dessert banana plantations, (v) the availability and the costs of substitution foods, should the yield of plantains and other cooking bananas be substantially reduced, (vi) the importance of banana for smallholdings and for subsistence production in French Guiana and Réunion, and (vii) the potential environmental impact (e. g. soil erosion, biodiversity, etc) of the pathogen in the PRA area. The Panel, based on the information provided in the document and on additional literature consulted, concludes that R. solanacearum race 2 is appropriate for evaluation of pest risk management options for the endangered areas of French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion and thus, potentially eligible for addition to the list of harmful organisms in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC...|$|R
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Plant Health was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on 30 pest risk assessments made by France on organisms, which are considered by France as harmful in four French overseas departments of French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion. In particular, the Panel was asked whether these organisms {{can be considered as}} harmful organisms for the endangered area of the above departments, in the meaning of the definition mentioned in Article 2. 1. (e) of Directive 2000 / 29 /EC and thus potentially eligible for addition to the list of harmful organisms in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. This document presents the opinion of the Panel on Plant Health on the simplified[1] pest risk assessment conducted by France on“Ralstonia sp. bacterium responsible for banana blood disease” with French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion considered as endangered area. Ralstonia sp. responsible for banana blood disease – also called blood disease bacterium (BDB) – is the causal agent in Indonesia of a lethal disease of dessert banana (Musa spp.), plantain (Musa spp.) and cooking banana, known as blood disease of banana. The Panel examined in detail the risk assessment provided, and considered the accuracy and quality of the information and methods applied for pest risk assessment purposes. The review was based on the principles and terminology of the International Standard on Phytosanitary Measures ISPM No. 11 [2]: Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests including analysis of environmental risks and living modified organisms (2004) by the International Plant Protection Convention (FAO, 2007). The Panel observes that:*The pest risk assessment provides a very limited amount of information supported by scientific data to justify the conclusions reached. The probabilities of entry, establishment and spread and the potential impacts of BDB in the PRA area[3] should have been assessed separately for each department, due to the differing importance of banana crops in each of the departments. Furthermore, the new situation in the PRA area, in case the current phytosanitary regulations governing the imports of banana plant material are lifted, should have been taken into account in the document. *The entry pathways should have been considered and assessed in the document in terms of importance and risk,*French Guiana, {{which is part of the}} PRA area in the document, is not mentioned in the assessor’s general conclusion. The Panel concludes that:*The identity of the pathogen can be defined as “Ralstonia sp. agent of banana blood disease”, also called blood disease bacterium (BDB). Although the taxonomical position of the pathogen is not yet assigned by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Plant Pathogenic Bacteria, BDB can be identified by cultural and molecular methods*The entry of BDB into the French overseas departments through natural dispersal is not likely due to their great distance from the areas of the pathogen’s present distribution. *Under thecurrent regulations, the probability of entry of BDB on Musa (and ornamental Heliconia if proven a natural host) plant propagation material (<b>other</b> <b>than</b> vitroplants), <b>banana</b> fruit and soil would be low for French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion due to the import restrictions. *Should the current regulations governing the imports of banana plant material be lifted, the probability of entry of BDB on Musa (and ornamental Heliconia if proven a natural host) plant propagation material (<b>other</b> <b>than</b> vitroplants), <b>banana</b> fruit and soil would be moderate. *The probability of BDB entering the PRA area on vitroplants would be very low, as such production systems are characterised by high sanitation practices that ensure pathogen-free propagation material, provided that mother plants are carefully screened prior to collection of material for in vitro multiplication. *The probability of establishment and spread, should BDB gain entry into the PRA area, would be high, given that most of the endangered area has a climate similar to that of the pathogen’s present distribution, and that Musa host plants are present in the PRA area. *Within commercial plantations of bananas the disease effects could be mitigated by existing practices of de-budding and bagging of male flowers. However, additional routine sanitation measures would be necessary at extra costs. With the possibility of continuous re-infestation from the environment, the production costs would be structurally increased. The additional control costs may reduce the competitiveness of the banana industry in Guadeloupe and Martinique. As a result, employment may be reduced causing negative social impacts. There is uncertainty regarding the level of the cost increase. *Plantain and other cooking bananas are an important staple food and a large fraction is household-produced. Since the disease is likely not to be readily controllable in smallholdings and family gardens, high yield losses and a potential disruption of subsistence production and consumption patterns would occur. This may also cause negative social impacts. There is uncertainty regarding the availability and the costs of substitution foods, should the yield of cooking banana and plantain be substantially reduced. Similar effects are envisaged for Guiana, where the banana crop is an element of shifting cultivation. *Uncertainties of a moderate degree are related to the (i) host range of BDB, in particular the clarification of the status of Heliconia as a natural host (ii) the flower characteristics (bract dehiscence, sugar content of male flowers) of the banana cultivars grown in the French overseas departments, that may influence the spread by insects of BDB, (iii) the ability of the BDB to spread in the environment from fruit waste, (iv) the level of cost increase due to routine sanitation practices in commercial banana plantations, in case of BDB introduction, (v) the availability and the costs of substitution foods, should the yield of cooking banana and plantain be substantially reduced by the BDB introduction, (vi) the potential environmental impact (e. g. soil erosion, changes in biodiversity, etc) of the BDB in the PRA areaThe Panel, based on the information provided in the document and on additional literature consulted, concludes that BDB is appropriate for evaluation of pest risk management options for the endangered areas of Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion as stated in the conclusion of the document, and the panel reaches the same conclusion for French Guiana. Therefore, the panel concludes that BDB is potentially eligible for addition to the list of harmful organisms in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC for all French overseas department...|$|R
40|$|To {{estimate}} the growth {{parameters of the}} banana prawn, P. merguiensis, a tag-recapture study, using vinyl streamer tags (Floy FTSL- 731, was undertaken throughout the northern Gulf of Papua. Recapture data were analysed using Fabens' derivation of the von Bertalanffy growth curve. A differential growth rate was found {{between male and female}} banana prawns: L∞ and K values for males were 29. 34 mm carapace length (C. L.) and 0. 136 per week, and for females 35. 34 mm C.
