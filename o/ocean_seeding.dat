40|$|Abstract — Recent {{theoretical}} {{research has shown}} that ocean currents and wind interact to disperse seeds over long distances among isolated landmasses. Dispersal of seeds among isolated oceanic islands, by birds, oceans and man, is a well-known phenomenon, and many widespread island plants have traits that facilitate this process. Crucially, however, there have been no mechanistic vector-based models of long-distance dispersal for seeds among isolated oceanic islands based on empirical data. Here, we propose a plan to develop seed analogues, or pseudoseeds, fitted with wireless sensor technology that will enable high-fidelity tracking as they disperse across the ocean. The pseudoseeds will be precisely designed to mimic actual seed buoyancy and morphology enabling realistic and accurate, vector-based dispersal models of <b>ocean</b> <b>seed</b> dispersal over vast geographic scales...|$|R
5000|$|Entada gigas, {{commonly}} known as the monkey-ladder, sea bean, Cœur de la Mer [...] or Sea Heart, is a species of flowering liana in the pea family, Fabaceae, that is native to Central America, the Caribbean, northern South America, and Africa. It is notable for having the family's largest seedpods, which measure 12 cm across and can reach 2 m in length. Inside the pods are ten to fifteen seeds, each of which have a diameter of 6 cm and a thickness of 2 cm. [...] The seeds contain a hollow cavity, which gives them buoyancy. After being washed by rain into rivers and then the <b>ocean,</b> the <b>seeds</b> of E. gigas drift long distances on <b>ocean</b> currents. <b>Seed</b> buoyancy and vitality lasts at least two years.|$|R

50|$|Likewise, {{two small}} potted oil palms brought {{back by the}} VOC from Mauritius, {{an island in the}} Indian <b>Ocean,</b> {{produced}} <b>seeds</b> after six years, and these were propagated throughout all of Southeast Asia, becoming a major source of revenue in the Dutch East Indies and now in Indonesia.|$|R
50|$|The Dragosaurus, {{a mysterious}} prehistoric animal, {{surviving}} unknowingly {{in the depths}} of the <b>oceans,</b> <b>seeds</b> panic by devouring huge quantities of oil around the planet, until it starts to head for Tokyo. However, despite this Japan has some aces in his sleeves: Grendizer, Great Mazinger and Getter Robo G, which are immediately sent to stop the monstrous animal. Unfortunately, the awkward Boss Borot joins the team and ends up being swallowed by the Dragosaurus rendering all more difficult. Boss Borot eventually manages to escape the creature's stomach thanks to Great Mazinger. As the three super robots try to fight off Dragonsaurus the animal makes its way to Tokyo and goes on a rampage. Dragonaurus is eventually killed off after Getter Robo G uses the Shine Spark to ignite the large quantities of oil in its body, saving the city.|$|R

50|$|The {{orbiting}} races, the Spacers, terraform Earth by crashing ice comets into it {{to replenish}} the <b>oceans,</b> and <b>seed</b> the planet with genetically created organisms based upon re-sequenced DNA data saved from the escape to orbit. Once a breathable atmosphere is recreated, and sufficient {{plant and animal}} species have been reseeded, some members of the orbiting races ("Sooners") resettle the planet, in violation of treaty agreements.|$|R
50|$|The water lily is {{an example}} of such a plant. Water lilies' flowers make a fruit that floats in the water {{for a while and then}} drops down to the bottom to take root on the floor of the pond.The seeds of palm trees can also be {{dispersed}} by water. If they grow near <b>oceans,</b> the <b>seeds</b> can be transported by ocean currents over long distances, allowing the seeds to be dispersed as far as other continents.|$|R
50|$|The {{seeds of}} the plant are wind-dispersed, but because they remain viable in fresh and salt water, they are also {{commonly}} dispersed on the water. As a coastal species, they are carried on <b>ocean</b> currents. The <b>seeds</b> can also be transported in soil and plant waste.|$|R

50|$|Some {{animal and}} plant species have reached New Caledonia from {{surrounding}} regions and in turn, some New Caledonian species have successfully extended their ranges into the Pacific Ocean area. Other New Caledonian species or their close relatives are found in regions remote from the archipelago. For example, the New Caledonian parakeet {{is known to be}} the basal species in the genus Cyanoramphus, which has spread to many Pacific islands. Many bats and birds that rely heavily on fruit for their diet, including members of the families Cotingidae, Columbidae, Trogonidae, Turdidae, and Toucan, swallow seeds, then regurgitate them or pass them in their faeces. Such seed dispersal (ornithochory) has been a major mechanism of <b>seed</b> dispersal across <b>ocean</b> barriers. <b>Seeds</b> of grasses, spores of algae, and the eggs of molluscs and other invertebrates may stick to the feet or feathers of birds, particularly migratory or aquatic birds, and in this way may travel long distances.|$|R
40|$|Pond apple invades {{riparian}} {{and coastal}} environments with water {{acting as the}} main vector for dispersal. As seeds float and can reach the <b>ocean,</b> a <b>seed</b> tracking model driven by near surface ocean currents was used to develop maps of potential seed dispersal. Seeds were ‘released’ in the model from sites near the mouths of major North Queensland rivers. Most seeds reach land within three months of release, settling predominately on windward-facing locations. During calm and monsoonal conditions, seeds were generally swept in a southerly direction, however movement turns northward during south easterly trade winds. Seeds released in February from the Johnstone River were capable of being moved anywhere from 100 km north to 150 km south depending on prevailing conditions. Although wind driven currents are the primary mechanism influencing seed dispersal, tidal currents, the East Australian Current, and other factors such as coastline orientation, release location and time also {{play an important role}} in determining dispersal patterns. In extreme events such as tropical cyclone Justin in 1997, north east coast rivers could potentially transport seed over 1300 km to the Torres Strait, Papua New Guinea and beyond...|$|R
5000|$|... 44.a. One day {{the master}} (Linji Yixuan) and Puhua {{went to a}} {{vegetarian}} banquet given them by a believer. During it, the master asked Puhua: [...] "'A hair swallows the vast <b>ocean,</b> a mustard <b>seed</b> contains Mt. Sumeru' - does this happen by means of supernatural powers, or is the whole body (substance, essence) like this?" [...] Puhua kicked over the table. The master said: [...] "Rough fellow." [...] Puhua retorted: [...] "What place is this here to speak of rough and refined ?"b. The next day, they went again to a vegetarian banquet. During it, the master asked: [...] "Today's fare, how does it compare with yesterday's?" [...] Puhua (as before) kicked over the table. The master said: [...] "Understand it you do - but still, you are a rough fellow." [...] Puhua replied: [...] "Blind fellow, does one preach of any roughness or finesse in the Buddha-Dharma?" [...] The master stuck out his tongue.|$|R
40|$|Many populations {{live and}} {{disperse}} in advective media. A fundamental question, {{known as the}} “drift paradox” in stream ecology, is how a closed population can survive when it is constantly being transported downstream by the flow. Recent population-level models {{have focused on the}} role of diffusive movement in balancing the effects of advection, predicting critical conditions for persistence. Here, we formulate an individual-based stochastic analog of the model described in (Lutscher et al., SIAM Rev. 47 (4) : 749 – 772, 2005) to quantify the effects of demographic stochasticity on persistence. Population dynamics are modeled as a logistic growth process and dispersal as a position-jump process on a finite domain divided into patches. When there is no correlation in the interpatch movement of residents, stochasticity simply smooths the persistence-extinction boundary. However, when individuals disperse in “packets” from one patch to another and the flow field is memoryless on the timescale of packet transport, the probability of persistence is greatly enhanced. The latter transport mechanism may be characteristic of larval dispersal in the coastal <b>ocean</b> or wind-dispersed <b>seed</b> pods...|$|R
25|$|This led to {{long periods}} of {{evolution}} in near complete isolation. The isolation of the island was not absolute, given {{the rise and fall}} of sea level caused by the ebb and flow of ice ages. Land bridges or islands formed between Tasmania and its neighbour, mainland Australia. Thus new species came to Tasmania while Gondwanan species were able to penetrate the Pacific Islands region. Plants have limited seed dispersal mobility away from the parent plant and consequently rely upon a variety of dispersal vectors to transport their propagules, including both abiotic and biotic vectors. Seeds can be dispersed away from the parent plant individually or collectively, as well as dispersed in both space and time. Birds and bats swallow seeds, then regurgitate them or pass them in their faeces. Such seed dispersal has been a major mechanism of <b>seed</b> dispersal across <b>ocean</b> barriers. Other <b>seeds</b> may stick to the feet or feathers of birds, particularly migratory or aquatic birds, and in this way may travel long distances. Seeds of grasses, spores of algae, and the eggs of molluscs and other invertebrates commonly establish in remote areas after long journeys of such types.|$|R
40|$|A triplex reverse {{transcriptase}} PCR (RT-PCR) {{was developed to}} simultaneously detect poliovirus, hepatitis A virus (HAV), and rotavirus in sewage and ocean water. Sewage and <b>ocean</b> water samples <b>seeded</b> with the three different viruses were concentrated by ultrafiltration. The unseeded ocean water and sewage samples were concentrated by vortex flow filtration and/or ultrafiltration. Random hexamers and a rotavirus downstream primer were used to initiate reverse transcription. Three different sets of primers specific for poliovirus, HAV, and rotavirus cDNAs were mixed in the PCR mixture to amplify the target DNA. Three distinct amplified DNA products representing poliovirus, HAV, and rotavirus were identified by gel electrophoresis as 394 -, 192 -, and 278 -bp sequences, respectively. Dot blot and Southern analyses were used to confirm the amplified products for each virus present in the environmental samples. Except for poliovirus, the sensitivity of triplex RT-PCR {{for the detection of}} rotavirus and HAV was found to be similar to that of monoplex RT-PCR, which uses only one set of primers to amplify a single type of virus. The triplex RT-PCR has greater advantages over monoplex RT-PCR for virus detection, namely, the rapid turnaround time and cost effectiveness...|$|R

60|$|A still {{larger number}} of species owe their {{dispersal}} to birds in several distinct ways. An immense number of fruits {{in all parts of}} the world are devoured by birds, and have been attractively coloured (as we have seen), in order to be so devoured, because the seeds pass through the birds' bodies and germinate where they fall. We have seen how frequently birds are forced by gales of wind across a wide expanse of <b>ocean,</b> and thus <b>seeds</b> must be occasionally carried. It is a very suggestive fact, that all the trees and shrubs in the Azores bear berries or small fruits which are eaten by birds; while all those which bear larger fruits, or are eaten chiefly by mammals--such as oaks, beeches, hazels, crabs, etc.--are entirely wanting. Game-birds and waders often have portions of mud attached to their feet, and Mr. Darwin has proved by experiment that such mud frequently contains seeds. One partridge had such a quantity of mud attached to its foot as to contain seeds from which eighty-two plants germinated; this proves that a very small portion of mud may serve to convey seeds, and such an occurrence repeated even at long intervals may greatly aid in stocking remote islands with vegetation. Many seeds also adhere to the feathers of birds, and thus, again, may be conveyed as far as birds are ever carried. Dr. Guppy found a small hard seed in the gizzard of a Cape Petrel, taken about 550 miles east of Tristan da Cunha.|$|R
