To the north lay a network of sidings branching off to serve the Tinplate Works and Lower Deep Pit, while to the south were the Gasworks served by a private siding between 1911 and 1937. The Brynmawr and Blaina Gas Company received around 4000 tons of coal yearly during this period, after <b>which</b> <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> gas was sourced from Blaenavon. The station had two platforms linked by a covered footbridge which subsequently lost its roof. A pagoda shelter stood on the Down platform, whilst the solidly-built stone station building was on the Up platform with a 42-lever signal box which was in service until 11 October 1964.

40|$|Thesis (MTech(Environmental Health) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2011 <b>Coke</b> <b>ovens</b> {{may occur}} in the aluminium, steel, graphite, electrical, and {{construction}} industries. In the work area coke-oven workers may be exposed to various chemical compounds. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), as human carcinogen, are primary compounds in <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> emissions (COEs) generated in the coking process. <b>Coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers are often exposed to PAHs {{and can lead to}} a variety of human diseases. The primary routes of potential human exposure to <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> emissions are inhalation and dermal contact. Occupational exposure may occur during the production of coke from coal, or while using coke to extract metals from their ores to synthesize calcium carbide, or to manufacture graphite and electrodes. Workers at coking plants and coal tar production plants, as well as the residents surrounding these plants, have a high risk of possible exposure to <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> emissions. It is known that coke production could be carcinogenic to humans (Group- 1) by IARC. There has been sufficient epidemiological evidence suggesting an etiological link between carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) exposure and lung cancer risk among coke-oven workers. Lung cancer among coke-oven workers has been classified as one of the eight prescribed occupational cancers in China, and its incidence rate was about 10 times that of the general population. Therefore, lung cancer of coke-oven workers is still a critical issue in the field of prevention and control of occupational cancers in China. This thesis explores the various exposure levels of workers to PAHs at a steel plant in China. The measurement will focus on the exposure difference of personal sampling among workers in selected job classifications given the job descriptions and the coking process. The Benxi Steel Industry in Liaoning province of China (BXSI) was selected as the research location. Liaoning province is in the North of China and the location of various heavy industries in China.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: We {{investigated}} if blood Cu++/Zn++ superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase {{activities are}} increased and total plasma antioxidant concentration is decreased in <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. METHODS Ninety-six <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers {{participated in the}} study. Nonexposed workers (n = 105) were randomly sampled among power plant workers in the same age range. The examination included a questionnaire on health status, occupational history, smoking, and dietary habits. Blood samples completed the examination. <b>Coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers were classified into low-, middle-, and high-exposure groups based on the benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) air concentrations and were further classified into the categories "topside" and "non-topside," according to their proximity to the ovens. RESULTS: Erythrocyte glutathiane peroxidase activity increased with age (r = 0. 18, P = 0. 061) in power plant workers, whereas plasma glutathione peroxidase activity decreased with age (r = - 0. 18, P = 0. 068) and erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase activity was inversely correlated {{with the number of}} cigarettes per day (r = - 0. 28, P = 0. 08) in <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers. Comparison of blood antioxidant enzyme activities and total plasma antioxidant concentration between <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> and power plant workers showed that erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase activity was significantly lower in <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers, even after adjustment for potential confounding factors. No differences were found either in other blood antioxidant enzyme activities or in total plasma antioxidant concentration between <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> and power plant workers. Moreover; no trends toward decreased glutathione peroxidase activity among the three subgroups of B[a]P exposure were observed, and no differences either in blood antioxidant enzyme activities or in total plasma antioxidant concentration between the two groups of job categories were found.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] The aim was {{to assess}} the {{significance}} of two biomarkers; antibody to benzo(a) pyrene DNA adducts and concentration of hydroxyethylvaline haemoglobin adducts in samples from a well studied group of <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers. As a measure of exposure we have used 1 -hydroxypyrene in urine. METHODS [...] Urine and blood samples were collected from <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers and a control group. Samples from <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> plant workers were collected in January and June. 1 -Hydroxypyrene was measured in urine by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), antibodies to benzo(a) pyrene DNA adducts were measured by ELISA and hydroxyethylvaline haemoglobin adducts were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). RESULTS [...] Mean urinary 1 -hydroxypyrene in samples from <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers varied from 1. 11 to 5. 53 umol/mol creatinine and 0. 14 umol/mol creatinine in the control group. Workers at the top side had the highest values of urinary 1 -hydroxypyrene. Antibody to benzo(a) pyrene DNA adducts did not correlate with either 1 -hydroxypyrene nor length of work at the <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> plant. But antibody concentration in samples collected in January was predictive of the concentration in samples collected in June. A small non-significant increase in hydroxyethylvaline haemoglobin adducts was found in samples from <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers relative to the control group when comparing smokers and nonsmokers separately. CONCLUSION [...] 1 -Hydroxypyrene correlates well with exposure groups based on job description. Antibodies to benzo(a) -pyrene DNA adducts was related to people and not exposure. Work at a <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> plant might lead to increased hydroxyethylvaline haemoglobin adducts...|$|R

40|$|Studies on non-fatal health {{indicators}} represent positive developments for occupational disease prevention. The indicators include disease incidence, symptoms, and impaired physiological function. While cancer mortality of <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers {{has been extensively}} investigated, respiratory health of <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers is a poorly investigated area. Very few studies have ever been reported. Almost {{all of these are}} cross-sectional. This study utilised data extracted from a lung function surveillance system on <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers in a steelworks to investigate the association between respiratory health and exposure to <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> emissions, particularly the exposure effects on lung function and respiratory symptoms. <b>Coke</b> <b>oven</b> emissions are volatile materials escaping from the coke producing process. The emissions contain various complex chemical compounds, some <b>of</b> <b>which</b> are suspected to have hazardous health effects. The major pollution sources of <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> emissions are emission and leakage during the coke producing process. Chemical components of <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> emissions are absorbed mainly through respiratory and dermal routes. A few cross-sectional studies have reported that decreased lung function indices such as FEV 1 and of FEV 1 /FVC were associated with exposure to <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> emissions. <b>Coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers were also reported to have higher prevalence of bronchitis symptoms such as cough and phlegm. Longitudinal data from a lung function surveillance system on <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers in a steelworks were available for the period from 1978 to 2000. Some modifications were made to the surveillance system in 1990. There were 1851 individuals with valid data during the surveillance period, and they constituted the study population. Repeated lung function test results, respiratory symptom information, and smoking information were extracted from the surveillance database. Detailed occupational exposure histories were traced back from the payment system and human resource department in the steelworks. Four exposure groups (‘Operation’, ‘Maintenance’, ‘Electricity’ and ‘Other’) based on the perceived exposure levels were used to classify the subjects according to their detailed occupational exposure histories. The association between lung function and exposure to <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> emissions was investigated cross-sectionally and longitudinally. While a longitudinal analysis provides direct assessment of effects on individuals, a cross-sectional analysis is also important since not all subjects in the surveillance system had longitudinal data. Cross-sectional analyses on the pooled last (or only) sets of lung function tests were conducted by using multiple regression. Longitudinal analyses on the time trends of lung function change over time were conducted by using a two-stage analysis technique and mixed model. Logistic regression was used {{to assess the impact of}} risk factors on respiratory symptoms. The 1990 modifications made it necessary to produce separate analyses on the pre- and post-modification data to fully utilise the information. The surveillance data set provides a valuable resource for assessing cross-sectional and longitudinal effects of exposure on lung function. Particular strengths of the data are the relatively large sample size, long follow-up time (average around 8 years), and no evidence of recruitment associated selection bias between exposure groups. A cross-sectional study was conducted on the data collected before the 1990 modifications. The last (or only) sets of lung function tests for 1353 male <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers were pooled for the analyses.
