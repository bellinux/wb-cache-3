5|$|A {{circumstance}} {{occurred during}} the action which so strongly marks the invincible spirit of British seamen, when engaging the enemies of their country, that I cannot resist the pleasure I have in making it known to their Lordships; the Temeraire was boarded by accident; or design, by a French ship on <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> Spaniard on the other; the contest was vigorous, but, {{in the end the}} combined ensigns were torn from the poop and the British hoisted in their places. Collingwood's account, probably based largely on Harvey's report {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the battle, contained several errors. Temeraire had closely engaged two French ships, rather than a French and a Spanish ship, and had not been boarded by either during the action. Nevertheless, the account was popular and a print was rushed out purporting to show Harvey taking the lead in clearing Temeraires decks of enemy seamen.|$|E
5|$|They fought alone, or in bands {{composed}} of {{individuals from the}} same area. Thus {{it was thought that}} the zduhaći from eastern Bosnia fought together against those from Herzegovina and Montenegro. The zduhaći from Sandžak fought jointly against the Albanian zduhaći. On the Adriatic coast, battles were waged between a band of zduhaći from Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, and northern Albania on <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> band of zduhaći from Apulia in southeast Italy on the other side. The latter were also called the transmarine zduhaći, as Apulia is situated across the Adriatic Sea from Montenegro. Each band had its leader. A man named Mato Glušac (1774–1870), from the village of Korita in Herzegovina, was reputed the supreme commander of the Herzegovinian and Montenegrin zduhaći; he was also a famous seer.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to promote}} a {{commemorative}} coin for the exposition began around January 1892. They were strongly advocated {{by the head of}} the Company's Committee on Liberal Arts, James Ellsworth, who was particularly interested as he had recently purchased a 16th-century painting by Lorenzo Lotto of a learned man, said to be Columbus. Ellsworth wanted the portrait to be the basis of the coin. In this, he was advised by author and journalist William Eleroy Curtis, also a fair official. In April 1892, partisans had gained the support of the Director of the Bureau of the Mint, Edward O. Leech, who envisioned a coin carrying a visage of Columbus on <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> suitable inscription on the other. Curtis was well aware of the difficulties with the Mint's failed competition for new silver coins in 1891, which had led to the issuance of the Barber coinage, designed by Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber. The new coins were widely criticized, and Curtis counseled Ellsworth to gain control of the commemorative coin's design process, to ensure both a better design {{and the use of the}} Lotto portrait. No United States coin had depicted an actual person, although the goddess of Liberty had often been portrayed.|$|E

25|$|A {{steatite}} seal, {{popularly known}} as Pashupati Seal (around 2350–2000 BC) was discovered at the Mohenjo-daro archaeological site in 1928–29 of the Indus Valley Civilization.

25|$|The Raid on Bir el Hassana (Hasna) {{occurred}} in the Sinai Peninsula in February 1917, during World War I. It was a minor action between an augmented battalion of the Imperial Camel Corps on the <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> score of Turkish troops plus some armed Bedouin on the other. The raid is only notable because it occasioned the first aeromedical evacuation in the British Army, and possibly in history.|$|E

25|$|The {{root cellar}} is promarily {{constructed}} of field stone and mortar, with a wood shingled gable roof on top. Access into the cellar is an inclined double wooden cellar {{door at the}} surface, down a set of stairs, and through a second wooden door {{at the bottom of}} the stairs. The cellar has a round air vent on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> square screened hole on the other, providing air movement into the cellar.|$|E
25|$|An aisle is, {{in general}} (common), {{a space for}} walking with rows of seats on both sides or with rows of seats on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> wall on the other. Aisles {{can be seen in}} airplanes, certain types of buildings, such as churches, cathedrals, synagogues, meeting halls, parliaments and legislatures, courtrooms, theatres, and in certain types of {{passenger}} vehicles. Their floors may be flat or, as in theatres, stepped upwards from a stage.|$|E

50|$|The station {{had three}} platforms; <b>one</b> <b>side</b> platform, <b>and</b> <b>an</b> island platform.|$|R
25|$|Many older {{structures}} were fabricated by inserting red-hot rivets into pre-drilled holes; the soft rivets are then peened using an air hammer on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> bucking {{bar on the}} head end. As these cool slowly, they are left in an annealed (soft) condition, while the plate, having been hot rolled and quenched during manufacture, remains relatively hard. Under extreme stress the hard plates can shear the soft rivets, resulting in failure of the joint.|$|E
25|$|Sandstone slip gate piers {{are found}} at the bottom entry point to the Buchans field beside the {{pedestrian}} footpath. Such slip gates were built {{with a series of}} downward facing 'L'-shaped grooves on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> matching concavity on the other gatepost. Wood bars could then be inserted across and parallel, giving a gate without a hinge. These are sometimes still found in the countryside at large, but they are almost always adapted to carry metal hinged gates. In some areas wood rather than stone was used to construct this type of hinge-less gatepost.|$|E
25|$|The Zilla Parishad of North 24 Parganas {{came into}} {{existence}} on 26 June 1986 due to bifurcation of erstwhile 24 Parganas district with respect to North South divide on geographical pattern.

60|$|A {{few moments}} elapsed, {{during which the}} Captain, now clothed in his most dreadful attributes, fixed his eyes {{severely}} upon the crew, when suddenly a lane formed through the crowd of seamen, and the prisoners advanced--the master-at-arms, rattan in hand, on <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> <b>an</b> armed marine on the other--and took up their stations at the mast.|$|R
