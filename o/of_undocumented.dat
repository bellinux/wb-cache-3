5|$|The Court {{made clear}} that the {{interests}} of children should be assumed to be covered as part of the interests of the parent, not treated as separate, but this doctrine has been less clear in practice as termination proceedings still focus on the fitness of the parent. This has resulted in further constitutional protections for parents and increasingly formal termination proceedings that limit the contribution of the child's interests in the proceedings. Santosky has also contributed to the role of parental rights <b>of</b> <b>undocumented</b> immigrants as the constitutionally protected parental rights may apply to non-citizens as well as United States citizens.|$|E
5|$|During the {{transition}} from MS-DOS to Windows, the success of Microsoft's product Microsoft Office allowed the company to gain ground on application-software competitors, such as WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3. Novell, an owner of WordPerfect for a time, alleged that Microsoft used its inside knowledge of the DOS and Windows kernels and <b>of</b> <b>undocumented</b> Application Programming Interface features to make Office perform better than its competitors. Eventually, Microsoft Office became the dominant business suite, with a market share far exceeding that of its competitors. In March 1992, Microsoft released Windows 3.1 along with its first promotional campaign on TV; the software sold over three million copies in its first two months on the market. In October, Windows for Workgroups 3.1 was released with integrated networking abilities such as peer-to-peer file and printing sharing. In November, Microsoft released {{the first version of}} their popular database software Microsoft Access.|$|E

Areas in the Philippines such as the Babuyan Islands, Cagayan (the first modern mortality of the species in the nation was in 2007), Calayan and Pasaleng Bay, the Ryukyu Islands, the Volcano Islands in Japan and the Northern Mariana Islands recently again became stable/growing wintering grounds while the Marshall Islands, Vietnamese, Taiwanese and Chinese coasts show slow or no obvious recovery.|$|E

25|$|Non-citizens {{who remain}} in Australia after their visa has expired are termed overstayers.

25|$|Officially, second-generation Americans are U.S. {{citizens}} by birth.

25|$|Further, food {{insecurity}} among undocumented communities can {{in some cases}} be traced to environmental injustices.

25|$|Some who {{advocate}} against greater government involvement in healthcare have {{asserted that the}} difference in costs {{between the two nations}} is partially explained by the differences in their demographics. Illegal immigrants, more prevalent in the U.S. than in Canada, also add a burden to the system, as many of them do not carry health insurance and rely on emergency rooms— which are legally required to treat them under EMTALA— as a principal source of care. In Colorado, for example, an estimated 80% <b>of</b> <b>undocumented</b> immigrants do not have health insurance.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{political}} {{developments in the}} 1980s such as the militant Khalistan movement, the influx <b>of</b> <b>undocumented</b> Bangladeshi immigration into Assam, Muslim mobilisation in the Shah Bano case {{as well as the}} Satanic Verses controversy caused a sense of vulnerability among the Hindus in India. The VHP and the BJP utilised this sense of vulnerability to push forward a militant Hindutva nationalist agenda leading to the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. The BJP officially adopted Hindutva as its ideology in its 1989 Palampur resolution, reversing the 1951 move of its original founder Syama Prasad Mookerjee. This led to the unlawful demolition of the Babri Masjid by rioters in 1992.|$|E
25|$|In South Africa, {{circular}} migration exists {{in part because}} of the population mobility associated with Apartheid. Cheap labor for men existed primarily in mines and industry in urban areas, pulling men from rural areas around the country. However, their family members who were unemployed were legally bound to remain their rural villages, thus establishing a pattern of {{circular migration}} that continues to this day. These mining and industrial centers attract workers from rural areas within South Africa, as well as rural areas in neighboring countries. There is a minimum of 2.5 million legal migrants, though the number <b>of</b> <b>undocumented</b> workers is likely very high. 55% of households in 2001 had at least one temporary migrant.|$|E

These stateless Emiratis — also known as bidun — either migrated to the UAE before independence or were natives who failed to register as citizens.

25|$|During {{the period}} from 20002005 it is {{estimated}} that 49,722 people left the state for the United States. Some 82,000 people are thought to have immigrated to the state from 20002005 mainly coming from Veracruz (17.6%), United States (16.2%), Durango (13.2%), Coahuila (8.0%) and Chiapas (4.5%). It is believed that there is a large number <b>of</b> <b>undocumented</b> immigrants in that state the come from Central and South America which mainly settle in Ciudad Juárez. According to the 2005 census, the population grew 1.06% from 2000 to 2005. The state has an uneven settlement of people and the lowest population density of any Mexican state; according to the 2005 census there were 12 people per km2. Of all the 3,241,444 people in the state, two-thirds (2,072,129) live in the cities of Ciudad Juárez and Chihuahua. Only three other cities have populations over 100,000: Parral 101,147, Cuauhtémoc 105,725, and Delicias 108,187.|$|E
25|$|On May Day, 2007, {{immigrant}} {{rights groups}} held rallies in MacArthur Park in support <b>of</b> <b>undocumented</b> immigrants. The rallies were permitted and initially the protesters followed {{the terms of}} the permits but some of the protesters began blocking the street and after warnings by the LAPD the protesters in the street didn't disperse and the rally was declared an unlawful assembly. The LAPD only announced the declaration of the unlawful assembly in English leading to confusion by some in the crowd who only spoke Spanish. Police officers held a line to prevent protesters from entering the street and held the line and did not disperse the crowd until rocks, bottles, and other objects began to be thrown at the police. The officers began slowly advancing and fired rubber bullets and used batons to disperse crowd members who refused to comply with police orders to leave the area. Police were heavily criticized for firing rubber bullets at some journalists and hitting some with batons who did not disperse along with the crowds. Seventeen officers and two sergeants of the metropolitan division were recommended for punishment by a department internal review for their actions in the incident.|$|E
