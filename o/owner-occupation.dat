5000|$|Barnsbury {{was built}} around 1820, as a middle-class suburb, {{but after the}} Second World War (1939-1945), people moved to the suburbs.

At the war's end, the great housing demand rendered Barnsbury the place of cheap housing, where most people shared accommodation. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, people moving into the area had to finance house renovations with their money, because banks rarely financed loans for Barnsbury. Moreover, the rehabilitating spark was The 1959 Housing Purchase and Housing Act, investing £100 million to rehabilitating old properties and infrastructure.

40|$|This paper studies {{different}} {{housing market}} arrangements in an intertemporal pure consumption economy, {{consisting of a}} desirable and an undesirable housing location.

Under <b>owner-occupation,</b> the opportunity cost of living in a desirable location takes the form of random capital losses, and for-gone capital gains. The rental arrangement corresponds to <b>owner-occupation,</b> with capital gains and losses taking place with probability one. We show that under the rental arrangement the agents have strong incentives to choose their location according to the current match, while under <b>owner-occupation</b> these incentives are weaker, and borrowing constraints play a larger role in clearing the housing market.

Consistent with the empirical observations, we find that the interregional labor market is more fluid under rental housing than under <b>owner-occupation.</b> As a result of greater mobility, the rental arrangement also results in better allocational efficiency than <b>owner-occupation.</b> When dwellings are rented, the decision to move to a booming region is largely based on current productivity, whereas under <b>owner-occupation</b> random wealth effects encourage deviations from this optimal behavior. labour mobility; liquidity constraints; owner-occupation; rental housing...|$|E

Such perceptions were transformed by an aggressive marketing campaign by the building societies and building industry, to create a new mass market for <b>owner-occupation.</b> During the 1930 s they developed a number of extremely sophisticated marketing strategies, including strong elements of `lifestyle marketing’, to transform the popular image of a mortgage from `a millstone round your neck’ to a key element of a new, suburbanized, aspirational lifestyle.

40|$|<b>Owner-occupation</b> {{has become}} a major tenure form in Western Europe. Yet, {{relatively}} {{little is known about the}} way <b>owner-occupation</b> is provided, since most studies tend to concentrate only on the effects of different forms of state support for the tenure. This survey examines owner-occupied housing markets in five European countries, Britain, France, West Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands. Their housing markets vary substantially, but differences are especially marked between Britain and the rest of Europe. Differences in owner-occupied housing markets between these countries arise in the timing of the expansion of owner-occupation; in the relation between the building industry and dominant forms of housing promotion; in the roles played by the market for secondhand housing and in the importance of mortgage finance. One common characteristic of all these countries, however, has been the appearance of house-price inflation during the 1970 s. The rising long-term trend of house prices has been punctuated by periodic booms and slumps. Market instability has helped to cause the major crises of housing production that exist in all countries. The survey concludes by indicating the dilemmas under the current structures of provision for state policies aimed at expanding <b>owner-occupation.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{introductory}} chapter {{is to provide a}} review of the evolution of housing policy from the nineteenth century to 1979.

This chapter specifically examines: The Victorian origins of housing policy.

Also, <b>owner-occupation</b> is efficient if (i) the boom never shifts and there are no capital losses (ii) the asymmetric regional shocks are small or changes in busi-ness cycles are frequent; then people can protect themselves against (small) capital losses through precautionary saving. However, if the asymmetric regional shocks are large and persistent, the owner-occupied outcome is inefficient, as some agents are borrowing constrained, and cannot move to a booming region even when their current match is good. Thus housing prices are distorted, and also non-constrained agents typically follow non-optimal moving policies...|$|E
