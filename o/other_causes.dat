5|$|In children, {{particularly}} those younger {{than six years}} old, the diagnosis can be difficult and the condition is often initially mistaken (sometimes {{for up to two}} weeks) for <b>other</b> <b>causes</b> of pains and difficulty walking, such as viral infections, or bone and joint problems.|$|E

5|$|The hormones of the {{pituitary}} {{have different}} {{actions in the}} body, and the symptoms of hypopituitarism therefore depend on which hormone is deficient. The symptoms may be subtle and are often initially attributed to <b>other</b> <b>causes.</b> In most of the cases, three or more hormones are deficient. The most common problem is insufficiency of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or luteinizing hormone (LH) leading to sex hormone abnormalities. Growth hormone deficiency {{is more common in}} people with an underlying tumor than those with <b>other</b> <b>causes.</b>|$|E
5|$|While thunderclap {{headache}} is {{the characteristic}} symptom of subarachnoid hemorrhage, less than 10% {{of those with}} concerning symptoms have SAH on investigations. A number of <b>other</b> <b>causes</b> {{may need to be}} considered.|$|E
5|$|With <b>other</b> <b>causes</b> ruled out, {{people with}} {{non-specific}} {{low back pain}} are typically treated symptomatically, without exact determination of the cause. Efforts to uncover factors that might complicate the diagnosis, such as depression, substance abuse, or an agenda concerning insurance payments may be helpful.|$|E

5|$|Directly {{assessing}} nerve conduction {{of electrical}} impulses can exclude <b>other</b> <b>causes</b> of acute muscle weakness, {{as well as}} distinguish {{the different types of}} Guillain–Barré syndrome. Needle electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies may be performed. In the first two weeks, these investigations may not show any abnormality. Neurophysiology studies are not required for the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|During her {{operational}} {{career with}} the Kriegsmarine, Prinz Eugen lost 115 crew members; 79 men were killed in action, 33 were killed in accidents and three died of <b>other</b> <b>causes.</b> Of these 115 crew members, four were officers, seven were cadets or ensigns, two were petty officers, 22 were junior petty officers, 78 were sailors and two were civilians.|$|E
5|$|Hypothyroidism {{is managed}} with {{replacement}} of the hormone thyroxine. This is usually given daily as an oral supplement, and may take {{a few weeks to}} become effective. Some causes of hypothyroidism, such as Postpartum thyroiditis and Subacute thyroiditis may be transient and pass over time, and <b>other</b> <b>causes</b> such as iodine deficiency may be able to be rectified with dietary supplementation.|$|E

EUS may be used to obtain biopsy (tissue sample) of suspicious masses. EUS may also replace diagnostic ERCP for stone disease, although this depends on local availability.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, the Japanese Economic Stabilization Agency {{calculated}} that the Allied naval bombardments {{and other forms of}} attack other than bombing had caused 3,282 casualties, representing 0.5 percent of all casualties inflicted by the Allies in the Japanese home islands. The casualties attributed to naval bombardments and <b>other</b> <b>causes</b> included 1,739 fatalities, 46 persons who were still classified as missing and 1,497 people who were wounded.|$|E
5|$|Infection with P.falciparum {{may result}} in {{cerebral}} malaria, a form of severe malaria that involves encephalopathy. It is associated with retinal whitening, which may be a useful clinical sign in distinguishing malaria from <b>other</b> <b>causes</b> of fever. Enlarged spleen, enlarged liver or both of these, severe headache, low blood sugar, and hemoglobin in the urine with renal failure may occur. Complications may include spontaneous bleeding, coagulopathy, and shock.|$|E

5|$|Neuropsychological tests {{such as the}} mini–mental state {{examination}} (MMSE) are widely {{used to evaluate the}} cognitive impairments needed for diagnosis. More comprehensive test arrays are necessary for high reliability of results, particularly in the earliest stages of the disease. Neurological examination in early AD will usually provide normal results, except for obvious cognitive impairment, which may not differ from that resulting from other diseases processes, including <b>other</b> <b>causes</b> of dementia.|$|E

5|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{isolated}} high LDL and clinical criteria (which differ by country), genetic testing for LDL receptor mutations and ApoB mutations can be performed.
