5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> was {{bypassed}} in 1933–34 by the three-lane Ridge Route Alternate, then U.S. Route99 (US99), {{to handle}} increased traffic and remove many curves. The four-lane US99 {{was completed in}} 1953 and replaced by a freeway, Interstate5 (I-5) around 1968. The portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> within the Angeles National Forest {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1997, following the efforts of Harrison Scott.

5|$|Although NY99 {{was signed}} as a state highway, {{maintenance}} on the route was performed by Franklin County, which designated the roadway as CR26. All of NY99 was initially a gravel road; however, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> was paved in the early 1970s {{through the use of}} state funds procured by New York State Senator Ronald Stafford of Plattsburgh. The western and eastern extents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> were paved soon afterward; however, the road was left unpaved in the vicinity of Loon Lake—a lake near the midpoint of the route—even though the necessary gravel base was applied to the entire highway. The unpaved section deteriorated as a result, and the NY99 designation was removed from the roadway on September26, 1994.|$|E

5|$|Originally planned as a new-build route across South London, {{construction}} of {{the first section of}} the South Circular near Eltham began in 1921 to a high-quality specification. The remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> was supposed to be of a similar standard but it was repeatedly delayed, and the current route was allocated in the late 1930s to existing urban streets instead. Despite several proposals to either upgrade the road or replace it with a parallel motorway, there has been little change in the century since the route was first planned and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> is still urban streets. The South Circular has received sustained criticism for congestion and pollution {{and is one of the}} least popular roads in Britain.|$|E

The route has a southbound exit and entrance to the Meadowlands Sports Complex before it crosses Berrys Creek. Upon crossing the creek, Route 120 continues northwest through industrial and commercial areas, intersecting with Murray Hill Parkway. A short distance past this intersection, the road becomes a four-lane undivided road that crosses New Jersey Transit’s Pascack Valley Line before coming to an interchange with Route 17. Here, Route 120 ends and County Route 120 continues to the west as Paterson Avenue.|$|E
