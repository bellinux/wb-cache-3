30|$|The above genetic {{operators}} {{based on}} evolutionary directions are special for MOPs. However, directional mutation operators for solving MaOPs are scarce. In this paper, we propose an adaptive Gaussian mutation <b>operator</b> guided by <b>preferred</b> regions for set-based many-objective evolutionary optimization that can steer individuals to mutate towards the preferred region. The set-based EA that integrates preferences {{combined with the}} proposed mutation <b>operator</b> guided by <b>preferred</b> regions is <b>called</b> PSEA-m.|$|R
50|$|For bush use, some <b>operators</b> <b>preferred</b> the Fairchild 82A to {{the more}} famous Noorduyn Norseman. The last 82A in service {{disappeared}} on a flight in the Northwest Territories on June 9, 1964.|$|R

50|$|Many <b>operators</b> <b>prefer</b> the moving-coil meter type {{of display}} {{in which a}} needle moves in an arc, because an angular {{movement}} is easier for the human eye to monitor than the linear movement of a bargraph.|$|R
40|$|Dairy policy often {{becomes a}} {{contentious}} topic during U. S. farm bill negotiations. The dairy subtitle of the 2012 farm bill has been debated and discussed since 2009. This research uses best-worst scenario methods to analyze dairy farmer preferences for policy options, including eliminating existing dairy policies, implementing new dairy policies related to income support and growth management, and ending ethanol subsidies. Results indicate that {{large and small}} dairy herd operators have differing preferences. Large herd <b>operators</b> <b>prefer</b> to end ethanol subsidies rather than specific dairy policy changes, while small herd <b>operators</b> most <b>preferred</b> support for income over feed-cost margins...|$|R
50|$|The Enviro200 chassis {{was also}} soon made {{available}} with Optare Esteem and MCV Evolution bodywork; {{this was followed}} in February 2007 by {{the launch of the}} Enviro200 body on MAN 14.240 chassis. This gave prospective operators the option of EGR emissions reduction for the Enviro200, as some <b>operators</b> <b>prefer</b> this technology to Cummins' SCR used on the integral design.|$|R
50|$|Autoteollisuus-Bilindustri built {{partnership}} with the Swedish subsidiary of General Motors; the initial plan was building coaches and cabins on Chevrolet and G.M.C. chassis for the Swedish market, but the Swedish <b>operators</b> <b>preferred</b> the domestically produced Scania-Vabis, Tidaholm and Volvo chassis; moreover, {{there was a strong}} local coachbuilding industry. Eventually the project lead to producing of vehicles for the Finnish market.|$|R
25|$|At sea, {{manoeuvres}} {{were slightly}} different {{and more complex}} because the operator would {{need to find a}} proper and stable place to fire. Some Hwacha <b>operators</b> <b>preferred</b> to be on the rowers' deck where they were able to shoot from the windows, while others preferred to be on the main deck so they could shoot at the sails of the enemy ships. These kind of manoeuvres were particularly seen on Korean Panokseon warships.|$|R

50|$|The system {{suffers from}} {{problems}} handling slippery track conditions and human operators {{are required to}} take control in any sort of precipitation. Because of the ATO limitations, drivers must make one trip per day under manual operation to stay in practice and are not penalized for running their trains manually at any time of their choosing. In practice, most <b>operators</b> <b>prefer</b> automatic operation as not only is it less effort, but it also tends to result in faster trips.|$|R
50|$|To {{suit their}} customers' tastes, the couple made many {{improvements}} on the dish, and offal slices were eventually replaced by various beef or lamb slices. Many people still <b>preferred</b> <b>calling</b> the dish fuqi feipian, thus {{the name is}} still used today.|$|R
25|$|The {{trends are}} illustrative for pool management, but whether scaling occurs {{also depends on}} other factors {{including}} interactions with Mg2+, B(OH)4− and other ions in the pool, as well as supersaturation effects. Scaling is commonly observed in electrolytic chlorine generators, {{where there is a}} high pH near the cathode surface and scale deposition further increases temperature. This is one reason that some pool <b>operators</b> <b>prefer</b> borate over bicarbonate as the primary pH buffer, and avoid the use of pool chemicals containing calcium.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} optimal {{illumination}} levels for offices equipped with visual display units(VDUs). Twenty-four paid subjects keyed in typical word processing data for 6 min per condition. General illumination {{was provided by}} a mixt. ure of indirect and direct lighting sources. This illumination was held at 350 lux at the workstation. The experimen-tal variables for the 6 conditions were: (3) two 11 3 uminat. ions of the room wall and (2) three illumination levels in the area directly ahead of the operator. When VDU workstations are illuminated at 350 lux to eliminate glare, <b>operators</b> <b>prefer</b> an intermediate i:L lumination level (800 lux) in the office space to their front over 415 lux or 1170 lux. <b>Operators</b> also <b>preferred</b> increased brlghtness contrast on the wal I.

50|$|One was {{exported}} to Hong Kong and entered service with China Motor Bus. A 36 ft long {{version of the}} Titan had been planned for this operator but that too was cancelled {{as a result of}} the difficulties at Park Royal and two Leyland Victory Mark 2s were built instead. A demonstrator, built in 1982, failed to secure any further orders, <b>operators</b> <b>preferring</b> the flexibility and lower cost of the Leyland Olympian. This vehicle was eventually sold to a Scottish independent operator, Ian Glass of Haddington.|$|R
50|$|When the Pan-European feed {{was still}} transmitted, the daily {{broadcast}} was of 15 hours (from 05:00 to 20:00) in Portugal. From that time, the channel was airing first with TNT, focusing on classic movies and professional wrestling, {{and in the}} final years with Turner Classic Movies. Some cable TV <b>operators</b> <b>preferred</b> dividing the two channels with their own dial (some {{with a description of}} their opening and closing times). Shortly after the release of Portugal's version of the channel, TCM and Boomerang stopped being aired in Portugal.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{in detail the}} mass operator analysis for the nonstrange L= 1 excited baryons in large N_c QCD. We present a straightforward procedure for constructing the large N_c baryon wavefunctions, and provide complete analytic expressions for the matrix elements of all the independent isosinglet mass operators. We discuss {{the relationship between the}} old-fashioned operator analyses based on nonrelativistic SU(6) symmetry and the modern large N_c approach, which has a firmer theoretical foundation. We then suggest a possible dynamical interpretation for the subset of <b>operators</b> <b>preferred</b> strongly by the data. Comment: 36 pages LaTe...|$|R
50|$|Most of the 17th century {{slave trade}} in New England {{was based in}} Massachusetts, however, direct {{attempts}} were not successful until {{the latter half of}} the century. In 1676, Boston ships began working with slave traders in Madagascar and by 1678 were selling slaves to Virginians. As for slaves imported to Massachusetts, <b>operators</b> <b>preferred</b> to trade Africans for more experienced slaves in the West Indies. Some Africans unsuitable for work in the West Indies were also brought to Massachusetts for sale. Boston ships were selling slaves to Connecticut by 1680 and Rhode Island by 1696.|$|R
5000|$|A follow {{focus is}} a focus control {{mechanism}} used in filmmaking with film cameras and in television production with professional video cameras. It is ergonomic rather than strictly necessary; {{in other words}} it does {{not contribute to the}} basic functionality of a camera but instead helps the operator be more efficient and precise. It is usually operated by a focus puller (often called the 1st assistant camera, or 1st AC) but some camera <b>operators</b> <b>prefer</b> to pull their own focus (the act of changing focus is called [...] "pulling" [...] or racking focus).|$|R

30|$|MLB algorithms, by {{adaptive}} cell sizing, are {{the most}} suitable solution to avoid these cell congestions. Such algorithms are based on optimizing different parameter settings in order to adjust service areas (e.g., cell transmission power). Consequently, connections are handed over from the problematic serving cell to the most suitable neighboring cell, sharing traffic and balancing the load of the network. The estimation of the best configuration parameters can be formulated as a classical optimization problem [21]. However, <b>operators</b> <b>prefer</b> solving these issues by heuristic rules as the full information required to build analytical models are rarely available.|$|R
40|$|I generalize the {{workhorse}} {{model of}} network competition to include income effects in call demand. Empirical work has shown call demand to increase significantly with income. For any positive income effect, network <b>operators</b> <b>prefer</b> a termination rate above marginal cost if networks are sufficiently differentiated. This holds {{with or without}} call price discrimination. Under price discrimination, the networks charge a lower price for calls within the own network (on-net) than to other networks (off-net). Income effects thus deliver theoretical results consistent with stylized facts about call prices and in line with regulatory concern about excessive termination rates...|$|R
5000|$|Most PURLs are {{so-called}} [...] "simple PURLs", {{which provide}} a redirection {{to the desired}} resource. The HTTP status code, and hence of the PURL type, of a simple PURL is 302. The intent of a 302 PURL is to inform the Web client and end user that the PURL should always be used to address the requested resource, not the final URI resolved. This is to allow continued resolution of the resource if the PURL changes. Some <b>operators</b> <b>prefer</b> to use PURLs of type 301 (indicating that the final URI should be addressed in future requests).|$|R
