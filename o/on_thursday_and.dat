5|$|The World Series {{started on}} a Tuesday for the second {{straight}} year, instead of a Wednesday as in the past. The practice was to avoid games <b>on</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>and</b> Monday nights, generally big days of television viewing, where Fox's telecast would face stiff competition from Thursday Night Football, ESPN College Football Thursday Primetime, various popular primetime entertainment shows, and Monday Night Football.|$|E

5|$|As per the {{regulations}} for , three practice sessions were held, two {{one and a}} half-hour sessions <b>on</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>and</b> another one-hour session on Saturday morning. After a thunderstorm on Wednesday night, {{the first of the}} two free practice sessions held on Thursday morning, started with every driver setting their installation laps on intermediate tyres. The track soon dried up, and the cars changed to slick tyres. Nico Rosberg had an early shunt when he clipped his front wing exiting the Tabac corner though he did not sustain considerable damage to his car. The two Mercedes drivers swapped places {{at the top of the}} time sheets for most of the session, until late improvements pushed Rosberg down the order to finish ninth, more than a second off his team-mate Lewis Hamilton. Rookie Max Verstappen surprised the paddock by finishing second, two-tenths of a second down on Hamilton. The Renault-powered cars all finished within the top seven, while the Williams team ended the session in tenth and seventeenth, owing to the car not being well suited for wet and low-temperature conditions.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two <b>on</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>and</b> a {{third on}} Friday—were held before the Saturday race. The Thursday afternoon and evening sessions lasted 90 minutes; the third, one-hour session {{was held on}} Friday afternoon. The first session was held in sunny weather conditions. The No. 1 Porsche 919 Hybrid driven by Hartley led the 90-minute period through its mid-way point with the fastest lap time of the day, at one minute and 58.012 seconds, almost six-tenths of a second ahead of team-mate Jani in second. Audi's second R18 was twice shown a black and orange flag {{because of a lack}} of telemetry for which the team was given a €1,000 suspended fine for the remainder of the race weekend and were required to change the vehicle's battery. LMP2 was led by Pipo Derani's No. 31 Extreme Speed Motorsports Oreca with a lap of two minutes and 8.974 seconds which was recorded within the session's first-quarter. Adam's No. 97 Aston Martin was quickest in the LMGTE Pro while Pedro Lamy helped the British manufacturer to be fastest in LMGTE Am.|$|E
5|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two <b>on</b> <b>Thursday,</b> <b>and</b> two on Saturday. The Thursday {{morning and afternoon}} sessions each lasted an hour. The third and final {{practice sessions}} were held on Saturday morning and lasted 45 minutes. The Thursday morning and afternoon practice sessions were held in dry and hot weather conditions. Michael Schumacher set the fastest time in the first session, at 1 minute and 23.039 seconds, three-tenths of a second quicker than Häkkinen. Coulthard was third fastest, ahead of Fisichella and Frentzen. Alesi managed sixth despite suffering from gearbox issues which caused him to pull up on the track. Eddie Irvine, Jenson Button, Barrichello and Salo completed the top ten fastest drivers in the session. Minardi's Gastón Mazzacane spun and lost his front right wheel in a crash at turn 17 and Ralf Schumacher made contact with the barrier at turn eight. In the second practice session, Häkkinen set the quickest lap of the day, a 1:21.387; Coulthard finished with the third fastest time. The McLaren drivers were separated by Michael Schumacher. Eddie Irvine was running quicker and was fourth fastest, in front of Frentzen and Ralf Schumacher. Alesi continued to encounter problems though he managed to be seventh quickest. de la Rosa, Trulli and Barrichello followed in the top ten. Both Nick Heidfeld and Pedro Diniz made contact with the barriers at turn 17 and Wurz crashed {{at the swimming pool}} complex.|$|E

5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions {{were scheduled to}} be held before the Sunday race: two <b>on</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>and</b> one on Friday. The first session was due to run for 105 minutes, and {{the second and third}} sessions were scheduled to last 90 minutes. Heavy rain on the days before the event resulted in the local clay absorbing a large amount of water. Only a small amount of evaporation had occurred due to low air temperatures. Race officials examined water that emerged through the track's surface in several areas on Thursday. The track surface had been drilled through overnight in an effort to drain collected water and prevent further seepage. CART's jet dryer was used on the track but, despite creating a dry track surface, water continued to appear through it. CART chief steward Chris Kneifel drove the pace car onto the track at 3:00p.m. British Summer Time (UTC+1) along with all 26 racing vehicles and 23 secondary cars under caution for five installation laps with both groups. No improvement was reported, and CART announced an hour later that the remainder of the day's activities were cancelled.|$|E
