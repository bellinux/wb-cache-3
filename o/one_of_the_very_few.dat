5|$|Given {{the ferocity}} of the Russian defense, {{everyone}} was aware that {{such a move would}} cost the lives of thousands of Guardsmen, but it was thought that the presence of this prestigious unit would bolster the morale of the entire army for a final decisive push. A notable exception was Marshal Bessières, commander of the Guard cavalry, who was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> senior generals to strongly advise against the intervention of the Guard. As the general staff were discussing the matter, general Rapp, a senior aide-de-camp to the Emperor, was being brought from the field of battle, having been wounded in action.|$|E
5|$|Groundwater {{levels have}} been dropping, to varying degrees, {{in many areas}} of the city, due in part to an {{increase}} in the amount of rainwater discharged directly into sewers rather than absorbed by the ground. A city agency, the Boston Groundwater Trust, coordinates monitoring of groundwater levels throughout the city via a network of public and private monitoring wells.

5|$|Myrmecia is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> genera {{where the}} workers lay trophic eggs, or {{infertile}} eggs laid as food for viable offspring. Workers laying trophic eggs {{have only been}} reported in two species; these species are M. forceps and M. gulosa. Depending on the species, colonies specialise in trophallaxis; queens and larvae eat eggs that are laid by worker individuals, but the workers do not feed on eggs. Neither adults nor larvae consume food during winter, but cannibalism among larvae is known to occur throughout the year. The larvae only cannibalise each other; this {{is most likely to}} happen when no dead insects are available.|$|E

5|$|Open {{heart surgery}} in India {{was at a}} nascent stage in the 1970s and early 1980s. After Panday {{returned}} to India from Canada, he joined the King Edward Memorial Hospital and Seth Gordhandas Sunderdas Medical College (KEM), in which he performed hundreds of open heart surgeries. The hospital was run on a government grant and generally catered {{to the middle class}} and poor, as the surgery was at the cost of the government. The hospital was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> places in India where heart surgery was performed. Panday was the chief of the second unit at KEM.|$|E
5|$|Polonium has {{no common}} {{compounds}}, {{and almost all}} of its compounds are synthetically created; more than 50 of those are known. The most stable class of polonium compounds are polonides, which are prepared by direct reaction of two elements. Na2Po has the antifluorite structure, the polonides of Ca, Ba, Hg, Pb and lanthanides form a NaCl lattice, BePo and CdPo have the wurtzite and MgPo the nickel arsenide structure. Most polonides decompose upon heating to about 600°C, except for HgPo that decomposes at ~300°C and the lanthanide polonides, which do not decompose but melt at temperatures above 1000°C. For example, PrPo melts at 1250°C and TmPo at 2200°C. PbPo is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> naturally occurring polonium compounds, as polonium alpha decays to form lead.|$|E

5|$|Swaminarayan {{wrote the}} Shikshapatri on 11 February 1826. While the {{original}} Sanskrit manuscript is not available, it {{was translated into}} Gujarati by Nityanand Swami {{under the direction of}} Swaminarayan and is revered in the sect. The Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency summarised it as a book of social laws that his followers should follow. A commentary on the practice and understanding of dharma, it is a small booklet containing 212 Sanskrit verses, outlining the basic tenets that Swaminarayan believed his followers should uphold in order to live a well-disciplined and moral life. The oldest copy of this text is preserved at the Bodleian Library of Oxford University and it is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> presented by Sahajanand Swami himself. Acharya Tejendraprasad of Ahmedabad has indicated in a letter that he is not aware of any copy from the hand of Sahajanand older than this text.|$|E
5|$|There {{were those}} {{concerned}} that the theatre was failing in its role as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> permitted to show legitimate drama. Management of the theatre after it reopened in 1813 fell to Samuel James Arnold, overseen by an amateur {{board of directors and}} a subcommittee focusing on the theatre as a centre for national culture. (Lord Byron was briefly on this subcommittee, from June 1815 until leaving England in April 1816.) Actor Edmund Kean was the on-stage highlight; like Macklin before him, he made his reputation as Shylock, premiering in the role in 1814. Kean remained until 1820 through praise and notorious disputes with local playwrights such as Charles Bucke.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} are {{more similar to}} each other than the {{elements}} in any other group are to each other. Indeed, the similarity {{is so great that}} it is quite difficult to separate potassium, rubidium, and caesium, due to their similar ionic radii; lithium and sodium are more distinct. For instance, when moving down the table, all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius, decreasing electronegativity, increasing reactivity, and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation. In general, their densities increase when moving down the table, with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> properties of the alkali metals that does not display a very smooth trend is their reduction potentials: lithium's value is anomalous, being more negative than the others. This is because the Li+ ion has a very high hydration energy in the gas phase: though the lithium ion disrupts the structure of water significantly, causing a higher change in entropy, this high hydration energy is enough to make the reduction potentials indicate it as being the most electropositive alkali metal, despite the difficulty of ionising it in the gas phase.|$|E

5|$|Around 1770 {{the neoclassical}} {{architect}} Robert Adam designed Pulteney Bridge, using as the prototype for the three-arched bridge spanning the Avon an original, but unused, design by Andrea Palladio for the Rialto Bridge in Venice. Thus, Pulteney Bridge became {{not just a}} means of crossing the river, but also a shopping arcade. Along with the Rialto Bridge and the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, which it resembles, it is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> surviving bridges in Europe to serve this dual purpose. It has been substantially altered since it was built. The bridge was named after Frances and William Pulteney, {{the owners of the}} Bathwick estate for which the bridge provided a link to the rest of Bath. The Georgian streets {{in the vicinity of the}} river tended to be built high above the original ground level to avoid flooding, with the carriageways supported on vaults extending in front of the houses. This can be seen in the multi-storey cellars around Laura Place South of Pulteney Bridge, in the colonnades below Grand Parade, and in the grated coal holes in the pavement of North Parade. In some parts of the city, such as George Street, and London Road near Cleveland Bridge, the developers of the opposite side of the road did not match this pattern, leaving raised pavements with the ends of the vaults exposed to a lower street below.|$|E
5|$|The same {{model was}} used for both the Kaled and the Thal domes. The gas attack in Part One was {{achieved}} through dry ice and green lighting. Some of the Thal guns were re-used props from the First Doctor (William Hartnell) serial Galaxy 4 (1965). The electric trolley used by the Kaleds in Part One worked in tests, but collapsed when Baker and Marter boarded it. The creature Harry and the Doctor glimpse {{at the end of}} Part Two was mainly a reused Ice Warrior costume, while the Thal rocket ship was a reused model from The Ambassadors of Death (1970). During the filming of Part Two, Miles and Chinnery had trouble fitting the gun on the Dalek. As a result, the scene had to be filmed in two takes, bridged with a reaction shot of the Doctor. Part Two is unusual in that it is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> episodes not to begin with a reprise, and also the first to end in a freeze frame. A stunt double for Elisabeth Sladen was hired for Sarah's fall from the scaffolding, but Maloney discovered that she would be falling eight feet, while Sladen had fallen ten feet in rehearsals. Maloney ultimately decided to conclude the episode with a freeze frame ending. Maloney would use the freeze frame technique again, most notably with The Deadly Assassin. The third episode overran its 25-minute limit and rather than cut material out the cliffhanger was changed from Davros' speech to the Doctor being electrocuted. The music for the serial was recorded on 3 March 1975 and the dubbing finished the day before Part One aired.|$|E
