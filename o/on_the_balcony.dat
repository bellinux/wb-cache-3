5|$|On VE Day—8 May 1945—the palace was {{the centre}} of British celebrations. The King, Queen, Princess Elizabeth (the future Queen), and Princess Margaret {{appeared}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony,</b> with the palace's blacked-out windows behind them, to the cheers from a vast crowd in the Mall. The damaged Palace was carefully restored after the War by John Mowlem & Co. It was designated a Grade I listed building in 1970.|$|E
5|$|The {{goodwill}} {{generated by}} this surprising {{turn of events}} defused the situation, but to many observers the scene <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> was mere theatricality without long-term resonance. However pleased {{it may have been}} by the royal displays, the crowd insisted that the king come back with them to Paris.|$|E
5|$|The {{woman is}} perched against an armoire, the man {{approaches}} and covers her naked {{body with the}} yellow bathrobe, and the two move towards the window. After they step out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony,</b> the man draws a toothpick {{from his pocket and}} hands it to her with an upwards nod, which she reciprocates. After looking out for another few seconds she clasps his neck lightly and they step back inside.|$|E

5|$|With 142 Queen's Scouts as Guard of Honour, {{and live}} {{broadcast}} by the BBC (commentator Richard Dimbleby), Baden-Powell House was opened on 12 July 1961 by Queen Elizabeth II. Afterwards, she toured {{the house with}} the Chief Scout and the president of The Scout Association, her uncle Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester. A black marble panel with gold lettering was put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> in the hall to commemorate the event.|$|E
5|$|A montage shows {{visitors}} on {{the rides}} at Walt Disney World Resort {{and the many}} visuals and animatronics that accompany the rides. It ends with a man losing his head while riding Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. On {{the last day of}} a family vacation at Walt Disney World, Jim White gets fired by his boss during a phone call <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> of the Contemporary Resort Hotel with his family. He keeps the news to himself to avoid spoiling their vacation. The family leaves their room and takes the monorail to the park, alongside two French teenagers, Isabelle and Sophie.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of 3 May, the niece {{of the woman who}} lived directly above the McCanns was sitting on her aunt's balcony, when she saw a man leave through the gate below, as though he had come out of a ground-floor apartment. What caught her attention was that he looked around before shutting the gate quietly, with both hands. At 14:30 two blonde-haired men were seen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> of 5C, an empty apartment two doors from 5A. At 16:00–17:00 a blonde-haired man was seen near 5A. At 18:00 the same or another blonde-haired man was seen in the stairwell of the McCanns' block. At 23:00, after the disappearance, two blonde-haired men were seen in a nearby street speaking in raised voices. When they realized they had been noticed, they reportedly lowered their voices and walked away.|$|E
500|$|Pappas {{continued}} to blame overcrowding for the disaster. However, an undercover press investigation discovered all his properties now display notices forbidding parties <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balconies.</b> Pappas also claims that {{a police report}} says two unnamed witnesses informed a paramedic that they saw several people [...] "jumping up and down" [...] <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balconies</b> shortly prior to the collapse.|$|R

50|$|In the 18th century, viceroys {{would stand}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balconies</b> to address <b>the</b> colonists. In religion, <b>the</b> <b>balconies</b> also {{provided}} abbesses {{the chance to}} observe mass while avoid being seen.|$|R
5|$|Perhaps the most-quoted anecdote {{concerning}} Hardee was that, on 9 October 1986 {{his house}} was searched by the police – who were looking for crumbs – two days after he and others stole Freddie Mercury's £4,000 40th birthday cake. No crumbs were found at the house as he had already by then donated the cake to a local nursing home. He used this incident {{as the title of}} his 1996 autobiography I Stole Freddie Mercury's Birthday Cake which he wrote with John Fleming. In another encounter with the police, Hardee was once questioned by Special Branch officers after being found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> outside government minister Michael Heseltine's hotel room, wearing nothing but a pair of socks and a leather coat containing £5,200 in cash and a pack of pornographic playing cards. He had mistaken the room for that of a friend.|$|E
5|$|Since the 20thcentury it {{has been}} {{traditional}} for the newly crowned monarch {{and other members of}} the royal family to sit for official portraits at Buckingham Palace and appear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony,</b> from where in 1953 they watched a flypast by the Royal Air Force. During the appearance, the monarch wears the Imperial State Crown and, if there is one, the queen consort wears her consort crown. In the evening, a fireworks display is held nearby, usually in Hyde Park. In 1902, EdwardVII's illness led to the postponement of a fourteen-course banquet at Buckingham Palace. In 1953, two state banquets were held in the ballroom there, and classical music was provided by the Royal Horse Guards.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of the video is shot in black-and-white, and shows Derulo sitting {{on the hood of}} a corvette outside a Malibu mansion dressed in 1920s attire. In another scene, Derulo is seen dancing at an area of the mansion which is surrounded by trees. The video then shows intercut scenes in full color of Derulo at the beach, on the mansion's balcony, and in the bedroom with his love interest (played by Tika Sumpter). More scenes in full color, show Derulo <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> interacting with her, and also shows him singing to her in the bedroom using a microphone. During another scene, Derulo is seen dressed in all white. The video ends with a kissing scene between the two which then fades away.|$|E

50|$|The {{principal}} valleys in {{the mountains}} include those of Hecho, Canfranc, Tena, Benasque and others. The green valleys hide pretty villages with nice Romanesque churches and typical Pyrenean houses with flowers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balconies.</b> <b>The</b> oldest Romanesque cathedral in Spain {{is located in the}} medieval town of Jaca in the very northern part of Huesca Province.|$|R
5|$|The {{essential}} elements of the coronation have remained largely unchanged for the past thousand years. The sovereign is first presented to, and acclaimed by, the people. He or she then swears an oath to uphold {{the law and the}} Church. Following that, the monarch is anointed with holy oil, invested with regalia, and crowned, before receiving the homage of his or her subjects. Wives of kings are then anointed and crowned as queen consort. The service ends with a closing procession, and since the 20th century it has been traditional for the royal family to appear later <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> of Buckingham Palace, before attending a banquet there.|$|E
5|$|Depending {{on which}} {{character}} the player assumes control of, either Chris or Barry {{is separated from}} the rest of the team during the chase and does not make it to the mansion. At this point, the team decides to split up to investigate. Over the course of the game, the player character finds several members of Bravo Team, including Kenneth J. Sullivan being eaten by a zombie; Richard Aiken, who is either killed by a giant venomous snake or eaten by a shark; Forest Speyer, who is found dead <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> and then revived as a zombie; and Bravo Team leader Enrico Marini, who reveals that one of Alpha Team's members is a traitor before being shot and killed by an unseen assailant. Bravo Team survivor Rebecca Chambers joins Chris. The player character eventually learns that a series of illegal experiments was being undertaken by a clandestine research team under the authority and supervision of biomedical company Umbrella Corporation. The creatures roaming the mansion and its surrounding areas are the results of these experiments, which have exposed the mansion's personnel and various animals and insects to a highly contagious and mutagenic biological agent known as the T-virus.|$|E
5|$|The squash {{house was}} {{constructed}} around 1920, completed in 1931, and was demolished between 2011 and 2013. It was {{located near the}} Logan Riding Ring, on the club's south entrance road. It was two stories high, five bays wide and nine bays deep, and was stucco-covered with a flat roof. There were two entrances on the main (south) facade, one at ground level and another <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony.</b> The entrances had double wooden doors, paneled below and glazed above. All of the building's windows consisted of wood-framed, paired casement windows with brick sills. A veranda with Tuscan piers extended {{the length of the}} main facade, interrupted by a two-bay-wide, one-bay-deep projection east of the main entrance. The building's interior contained a doubles court, two singles courts, a reception room, locker rooms, showers, and a spectators' gallery seating 150. Across the road from where the building stood is an outdoor riding ring enclosed by a rough rail fence. To the west of the building's site, standing alone in the tall grass, is a 16th-century post-and-lintel stone element, which {{was at the center of}} the stage of a 1,500-seat outdoor Greek amphitheater that was part of the Shepard estate and was since dismantled.|$|E
50|$|The {{street is}} bordered by seven-floor canuts {{buildings}} of the early 1900s. At No. 3, there are small heads <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balconies,</b> at 11 a courtyard with a house of golden stone, and at 40 a courtyard with a statue of the snake.|$|R
50|$|There were sultry days of brassy sun, {{but also}} cool evenings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balconies</b> facing <b>the</b> Don River, {{with the soft}} glow of {{charcoal}} in the samovar, with the ripe cherries crushed by your spoon against the {{bottom and sides of}} your glass of scalding tea.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{terraces}} {{were built}} in the [...] "Filigree" [...] style, a style distinguished through heavy use of cast iron ornament, particularly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balconies</b> and sometimes depicting native Australian flora. In the 1950s, many urban renewal programs were aimed at eradicating them entirely in favour of modern development.|$|R

25|$|Instances of {{ambiguity}} {{can be classified}} as local or global ambiguities. A sentence is globally ambiguous if it has two distinct interpretations. Examples are sentences like Someone shot the servant of the actress who was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> (was it the servant or the actress who was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony?)</b> or The cop chased the criminal with a fast car (did the cop or the criminal have a fast car?). Comprehenders may have a preferential interpretation for either of these cases, but syntactically and semantically, neither of the possible interpretations can be ruled out.|$|E
