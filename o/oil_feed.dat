5|$|Admiral Hipper {{left the}} Norwegian theater in September 1940 for an {{overhaul}} in Wilhelmshaven. After the routine maintenance was completed {{toward the end}} of the month, the ship attempted to break out into the Atlantic Ocean to raid merchant traffic. The engine <b>oil</b> <b>feed</b> system caught fire and was severely damaged. The fire forced the crew to shut down the ship's propulsion system until the blaze could be brought under control; this rendered Admiral Hipper motionless for several hours on the open sea. British reconnaissance failed to locate the ship, and after the fire was extinguished, the ship returned to Hamburg's Blohm & Voss shipyard, where repairs lasted slightly over a week.|$|E

They examined the possibility of a bomb, electrical failure or pilot error, but believed that the most likely possibility was a catastrophic mechanical failure. The cause of the accident is believed to be a malfunctioning overspeeding outboard propeller caused by metal particles obstructing <b>oil</b> <b>feed</b> line regulator valves. [...] The particles may have been formed by a gear that was damaged when the supercharger of the corresponding engine was accelerated (gear ratio shifted). The malfunctions of the propeller pitch might have provoked a flight disturbance and as a consequence the propeller may have sheared off.|$|E

40|$|Dietary fish oils, rich in (n- 3) PUFA, {{including}} {{eicosapentaenoic acid}} and docosahexaenoic acid, {{have been shown}} to have antiinflammatory properties. Although the antiinflammatory properties of fish oil may be beneficial during a chronic inflammatory illness, the same antiinflammatory properties can suppress the inflammatory responses necessary to combat acute viral infection. Given that (n- 3) fatty acid-rich fish oil supplementation is on the rise and with the increasing threat of an influenza pandemic, we tested the effect of fish <b>oil</b> <b>feeding</b> for 2 wk on the immune response to influenza virus infection. Male C 57 BL/ 6 mice fed either a menhaden fish oil/corn oil diet (4 g fish oil: 1 g corn oil, wt:wt at 5 g/ 100 g diet) or a control corn oil diet were infected with influenza A/PuertoRico/ 8 / 34 and analyzed for lung pathology and immune function. Although fish oil-fed mice had lower lung inflammation compared with controls, fish <b>oil</b> <b>feeding</b> also resulted in a 40 % higher mortality rate, a 70 % higher lung viral load at d 7 post infection, and a prolonged recovery period following infection. Although splenic natural killer (NK) cell activity was suppressed in fish oil-fed mice, lung NK activity was not affected. Additionally, lungs of infected fish oil-fed mice had significantly fewer CD 8 + T cells and decreased mRNA expression of macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 -α, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin- 6. These results suggest that the antiinflammatory properties of fish <b>oil</b> <b>feeding</b> can alter the immune response to influenza infection, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality...|$|R
40|$|Studying {{the effects}} of dietary fish oil on VLDL {{metabolism}} in humans is subject to both large intra- and interindividual variability. In the present study we therefore used hyperlipidentic apolipoprotein (APO) E* 3 -Leiden mice, which have impaired chylomicron and very low density lipoprotein (VDL) remnant metabolism, to study {{the effects of}} dietary fish oil on serum lipids and VLDL kinetics under highly standardized conditions. For this, female APOE* 3 -Leiden mice were fed a fat- and cholesterol-containing diet supplemented with either 0, 3 or 6 % w/w (i. e. 0, 6, or 12 % of total energy) of fish oil. Fish oil-fed mice showed a significant dose-dependent decrease in serum cholesterol (up to - 43 %) and triglyceride levels (up to - 60 %), mainly due to a reduction of VLDL (- 80 %). LDL and HDL cholesterol levels were not affected by fish <b>oil</b> <b>feeding.</b> VLDL-apoB kinetic studies showed that fish <b>oil</b> <b>feeding</b> resulted in a significant 2 -fold increase in VLDL-apoB fractional catabolic rate (FCR). Hepatic VLDL-apoB production was, however, not affected by fish <b>oil</b> <b>feeding.</b> VLDL-triglyceride turnover studies revealed that fish oil significantly decreased hepatic VLDL-triglyceride production rate (- 60 %). A significant increase in VLDL-triglyceride FCR was observed (+ 70 %), which was not related to increased lipolytic activity. We conclude that APOE* 3 -Leiden mice are highly responsive to dietary fish oil. The observed strong reduction in serum very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) is primarily due to an effect of fish oil to decrease hepatic VLDL triglyceride production rate and to increase VLDL-apoB fractional catabolic rate...|$|R

40|$|Rhesus monkeys {{were fed}} corn or coconut {{oil-based}} diets for 3 - 6 mo to determine {{effects on the}} composition of all lipoprotein classes and on the metabolism of high density lipoproteins (HDL). Major findings included the following. (a) Coconut <b>oil</b> <b>feeding</b> increased concentrations of all classes of plasma lipo-proteins without altering lipoprotein size, suggesting an increase in particle number. (b) The percentage of saturated fatty acids in the cholesteryl esters (CE) of low density lipoproteins (LDL) and HDL reached 40 % with coconut <b>oil</b> <b>feeding.</b> This value probably constitutes a minimum estimate of the CE which were of intracellular rather than intraplasmic origin.

Fat sources used included the following: Canola oil, soybean oil, fish oil, olive oil, hydrogenated vegetable oil, and fish oil combined with soybean, olive and hydrogenated vegetable oils. Blood serum HDL cholesterol levels were significantly higher with the polyunsaturated than with monounsaturated fat feeding and with <b>feeding</b> of non-fish <b>oil</b> supplemented oils than when fish oil supplements were used. Lower blood serum triglyceride levels were obtained with canola and fish <b>oil</b> <b>feeding</b> as compared to other w- 3 supplemented test oils.

40|$|A 28 -day {{study was}} {{conducted}} in 10 normolipidemic adult subjects to investigate the effects of soybean and coconut oil rich diets with/without psyllium fiber on serum lipids and fecal fat excretion levels. Subjects were fed soybean oil, soybean oil plus fiber, coconut oil and coconut oil plus fiber diets. Soybean and coconut <b>oil</b> <b>feeding</b> with psyllium fiber significantly reduced serum cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and apo-B levels in comparison to the values of soybean and coconut oil diets without psyllium fiber. Coconut <b>oil</b> <b>feeding</b> increased serum cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and apo-B levels. Fiber feeding with soybean and coconut oil diets significantly increased wet and dry fecal weights, fecal fat and palmitic acid excretion, and decreased fecal transit times as compared to the levels of soybean and coconut oil diets alone. Addition of psyllium fiber to saturated and polyunsaturated fat diets may be beneficial in the dietary management of hypercholesterolemic subjects. ^ In the second project, the USDA 2 ̆ 7 s Nationwide Food Consumption Survey 1987 - 88 was used to assess the intakes of dietary fat, cholesterol and fiber in the U.

40|$|Alteration in {{regional}} blood flow {{is important in}} the pathogenesis of organ failure during endotoxemia and sepsis. In particular, intestinal ischemia is thought to enhance the translocation of bacteria into the systemic circulation. We used radioactive microspheres to measure the influence of two intravenous (IV) dietary fats (vegetable oil containing high levels of ω- 6 fatty acids, and fish oil containing high levels of ω- 3 fatty acids) on regional blood flow during low-dose Escherichia coli endotoxin infusion (0. 1 mg/ 100 g body weight [BW]) in a rat model. Despite absence of changes in the cardiac output, blood flow rates to the small and large intestines, stomach, and pancreas, and also to the skin and skeletal muscle were significantly reduced after 18 hours of endotoxin infusion in the rats fed standard vegetable <b>oil.</b> Short-term IV <b>feeding</b> during a period of 40 hours with an isonitrogenous, isocaloric nutrient solution containing fish oil as the only lipid source normalized intestinal perfusion and increased blood flow to the liver and spleen. Low-dose endotoxin infusion also resulted in significant increases in glucose, lactate, and pyruvate concentrations. In comparison to standard vegetable fat emulsion, fish oil significantly reduced these parameters. A second experiment was conducted to measure lactate kinetics. Based on the dilution of U- 14 C-lactate, fish <b>oil</b> <b>feeding</b> was associated with higher lactate clearance than standard vegetable <b>oil</b> <b>feeding</b> during the endotoxin infusion. We conclude that short-term IV <b>feeding</b> with fish <b>oil</b> improves intestinal perfusion and portal blood flow, improves glucose tolerance, and increases lactate clearance in a low-dose endotoxin rat model. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
