5|$|From 1921, {{the country}} had {{negotiated}} the Little Entente with Romania and Czechoslovakia {{in the face of}} Hungarian designs on its territory, and after a decade of bilateral treaties, had formalised the arrangements in 1933. This had been followed the following year by the Balkan Entente of Yugoslavia, Greece, Romania and Turkey, aimed at thwarting Bulgarian aspirations. Throughout this period, the Yugoslav government had sought to remain good friends with France, seeing her as a guarantor of European peace treaties. This was formalised through a treaty of friendship signed in 1927. With these arrangements in place, Italy posed the biggest problem for Yugoslavia, funding the anti-Yugoslav Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation which promoted Bulgarian irredentism. Attempts by King Alexander to negotiate with Benito Mussolini fell on deaf ears, and after Alexander's assassination, nothing of note happened <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>front</b> until 1937. In the aftermath of Alexander's assassination, Yugoslavia was isolated both militarily and diplomatically, and reached out to France to assist its bilateral relationship with Italy.|$|E
5|$|The {{assault on}} Luga was still {{underway}} when Manstein received orders on 10 August that his next task {{would be to}} begin the advance toward Leningrad. No sooner had he moved to his new headquarters at Lake Samro than {{he was told to}} send his men towards Staraya Russa to relieve the X Corps, which was in danger of being encircled. On 12 August the Red Army had launched an offensive with the 11th and 34th Armies against Army Group North, cutting off three divisions. Frustrated with the loss of the 8th Panzer and the missed opportunity to advance on Leningrad, Manstein returned to Dno. His counteroffensive led to a major Soviet defeat when his unit encircled five Soviet divisions, receiving air support for the first time <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>front.</b> They captured 12,000 prisoners and 141 tanks. His opponent, General Kuzma M. Kachanov of the 34th Army, was subsequently court martialed and executed for the defeat. Manstein tried to obtain rest days for his men, who had been constantly fighting in poor terrain and increasingly poor weather {{since the start of the}} campaign, but to no avail. They were ordered to advance to the east on Demyansk. On 12 September, when he was near the city, he was informed that he would take over 11th Army of Army Group South in Ukraine.|$|E

25|$|The main {{materials}} {{used for the}} nano-studs are silver, gold, and aluminium, to name a few. However, gold and silver are not very efficient, as they absorb much of {{the light in the}} visible spectrum, which contains most of the energy present in sunlight, reducing the amount of light reaching the cell. Aluminium, on the other hand, absorbs only ultraviolet radiation, and reflects both visible and infra-red light, so energy loss is minimized <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>front.</b> Aluminium is therefore capable of increasing the efficiency of the cell by up to 22% (in lab conditions).|$|E
25|$|Though the Soviet {{operation}} at Korsun {{did not result}} in the collapse in the German front that the Soviet command had hoped for, it marked a significant deterioration in the strength available to the German army <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>front,</b> especially in heavy weaponry, nearly all of which was lost during the breakout. Through the rest of the war the Red Army would place large German forces in jeopardy, while the Germans were stretched thin and constantly attempting to extract themselves from one crisis to the next. Mobile Soviet offensives were the hallmark of the Eastern front {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E
25|$|By {{the morning}} of June 27, the Union forces were {{concentrated}} into a semicircle with Porter collapsing his line into an east-west salient north {{of the river and}} the four corps south of the river remaining in their original positions. McClellan ordered Porter to hold Gaines's Mill at all costs so that the army could change its base of supply to the James River. Several of McClellan's subordinates urged him to attack Magruder's division south of the river, but he feared the vast numbers of Confederates he believed to be before him and refused to capitalize on the overwhelming superiority he actually held <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>front.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The arms {{races of}} this period {{produced}} the military equipment that eroded the attacker’s advantage during Europe's [...] "Long Peace". It gave an advantage to the defender {{and set the stage}} for the stalemate of the First World War. The long reign of Vernichtungsgedanke as the prime tactical doctrine of modern warfare ended on the Western Front because of the huge concentrations of men and materiel <b>on</b> this <b>front</b> <b>that</b> made getting <b>on</b> the flank or rear of the enemy impossible. On the Eastern Front the idea was however redeemed and flourished in such battles as Tannenberg mainly due to the much lower density of men and machine <b>on</b> this <b>front</b> <b>that</b> left more space to maneuver.|$|R
25|$|On 24–25 March the 50th Division {{defended the}} canal crossings, then as Fifth Army {{continued}} to retreat, it fell back {{again during the}} night of 25/26 March, {{taking part in the}} Battle of Rosières over the following two days. On the morning of 27 March the CRE was ordered to form a composite infantry battalion from the 7th and 447th Field Companies and some details of 150th Brigade. The composite battalion took up a position to guard the flank of 149th Brigade but no enemy attack developed <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>front.</b> At 11.30, however, divisional HQ received a report that the enemy had broken through at Proyart, and the RE battalion was sent to cooperate with two battalions of the adjacent division (24th Division) in a counter-attack. This counter-attack was held up short of Proyart, but the existing trenches were held during the night and the following day, until the division withdrew towards Moreuil, where the German offensive was finally halted on 31 March.|$|E
25|$|The 33rd Reserve Division {{began the}} war on the Western Front, where it fought in the Battle of the Frontiers and {{advanced}} to the Verdun region. From September 1914 to August 1916, it occupied {{the line in the}} region between the Meuse and Moselle Rivers. In late 1916, it suffered heavy losses in the later phases of the 1916 Battle of Verdun. After a few months in the trenches in Lorraine, it went to the Chemin des Dames region and fought in the Second Battle of the Aisne, also known as the Third Battle of Champagne (and to the Germans as the Double Battle on the Aisne and in the Champagne), and again suffered heavy losses. In September 1917, the division was transferred to the Eastern Front, arriving shortly before the December armistice <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>front.</b> It returned to the Western Front in January 1918, where it fought in several engagements, including the Aisne and the Champagne-Marne offensives against French and American forces, after which it was disbanded and its troops distributed to other divisions. Allied intelligence rated it as a good division in 1917, but before its dissolution in 1918, it was rated as fourth class.|$|E
25|$|Several of McClellan's {{subordinates}} {{urged him}} to attack the Confederate division of Maj. Gen. John B. Magruder south of the Chickahominy, but he feared the vast numbers of Confederates he believed to be before him and failed {{to capitalize on the}} overwhelming superiority he actually held <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>front.</b> Magruder assisted in this misapprehension by ordering frequent, noisy movements of small units back and forth and by using groups of slaves with drums to simulate large marching columns. Furthermore, the Union Army Balloon Corps, which had performed the only aerial observation during the Peninsula Campaign, was now joined by a Confederate competitor. Capt. Langdon Cheves of South Carolina had constructed a multicolored balloon of dress silk obtained from Charleston and Savannah, which sailed aloft tethered to a boxcar on the York River Railroad, manned by Maj. Edward Porter Alexander. The appearance of this balloon reinforced McClellan's fear that the Confederates were planning for an offensive against his left flank. For the second day, the Confederates were able to continue fooling McClellan south of the river by employing minor diversionary attacks to command the attention of 60,000 Federal troops while the heavier action occurred north of the river.|$|E

25|$|Early on {{the morning}} of May 2, Hooker began to realize that Lee's actions on May 1 had not been {{constrained}} by the threat of Sedgwick's force at Fredericksburg, so no further deception was needed <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>front.</b> He decided to summon the I Corps of Maj. Gen. John F. Reynolds to reinforce his lines at Chancellorsville. His intent was that Reynolds would form up {{to the right of the}} XI Corps and anchor the Union right flank on the Rapidan River. Given the communications chaos of May 1, Hooker was under the mistaken impression that Sedgwick had withdrawn back across the Rappahannock and, based on this, that the VI Corps should remain on the north bank of the river across from the town, where it could protect the army's supplies and supply line. (In fact, both Reynolds and Sedgwick were still west of the Rappahannock, south of the town.) Hooker sent his orders at 1:55a.m., expecting that Reynolds would be able to start marching before daylight, but problems with his telegraph communications delayed the order to Fredericksburg until just before sunrise. Reynolds was forced to make a risky daylight march. By the afternoon of May 2, when Hooker expected him to be digging in on the Union right at Chancellorsville, Reynolds was still marching to the Rappahannock.|$|E

About the decision to cast Lawless as Hartley, who was always intended to be killed off at the end of the episode, Whedon said [...] "We wanted you to invest in the character and feel like this person was a real equal to Coulson.

In an interview with E! reporter Kristin Dos Santos, Dornan hinted that while his counterpart in Storybrooke has died, the huntsman could return at some point, as Dornan is still a regular on the series. As much of the episode involves Graham discovering his fairytale past, the writers designed the episode to mislead viewers by having them invest in {{the character}}. Kitsis and Horowitz commented that while the death made them [...] "sad," [...] the battle between Emma and Regina requires [...] "stakes and unfortunately, sometimes stakes are people's lives."
