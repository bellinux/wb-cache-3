5|$|Hand {{had voted}} for Hoover in 1928, {{and he did}} so again in 1932; but in 1936, he voted for the Democrats and Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a {{reaction}} to the economic and social turmoil that followed the Wall Street Crash of 1929. With the Great Depression setting in, Hand favored a policy of interventionist central government. He came to accept Frankfurter's view that redistribution of wealth was essential for economic recovery. Hoover resisted this approach, favoring individualism and free enterprise. Roosevelt, on the other hand, promised the voters a New Deal. They elected him on a platform of strong executive leadership and radical economic reform. Hand voted for Roosevelt again in 1940 and 1944, but he remained vigilant on the constitutional dangers <b>of</b> <b>big</b> <b>government.</b> Like others, including Walter Lippmann, he sensed the dictatorial potential of New Deal policies. He had no hesitation in condemning Roosevelt's 1937 bill to expand the Supreme Court and pack it with New Dealers.|$|E

500|$|Don Getty, one of Lougheed’s long-time cabinet ministers, {{returned}} to politics {{to win the}} leadership of the party. Getty's premiership was endorsed by a win in the 1986 general election that saw the NDP climb to 16 seats as the official opposition. Getty's reign became very unpopular as he led Alberta into large deficit spending, and marked an era <b>of</b> <b>big</b> <b>government</b> that, some said, the province could not afford. In the 1989 election he was defeated in his Edmonton-Whitemud riding, while his party still won a majority. He sat in the gallery as an unelected Premier until he won a seat in a by-election in Stettler. His refusal to leave as premier [...] helped Laurence Decore's Liberals skyrocket in popularity. Getty resigned and was replaced in a bitter leadership battle by Ralph Klein.|$|E
500|$|Macdonald (1815–91) was {{the first}} Prime Minister of Canada, in office 1867–73, and again 1878–91. [...] Brown depicts the Prime Minister {{in the role of}} scheming villain and caricatures his {{features}} in an absurd manner, giving him an extremely oversized nose and showing him as a drunk.

2500|$|Paul advocates {{substantially}} {{reducing the}} government's role in individual lives {{and in the}} functions of foreign and domestic states; he says Republicans have lost their commitment to limited government and have become the party <b>of</b> <b>big</b> <b>government.</b> In the 2012 Republican Presidential Primary, Paul cited President Dwight Eisenhower's farewell address warnings about the growing presence and strength of the [...] "military-industrial complex". His 2012 [...] "Plan to Restore America" [...] would eliminate five Cabinet-level departments: Energy, HUD, Commerce, Interior, and Education. [...] He has called for elimination of other federal {{agencies such as the}} U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the Internal Revenue Service, calling them [...] "unnecessary bureaucracies". Paul would severely reduce the role of the Central Intelligence Agency; reducing its functions to intelligence-gathering. He would eliminate operations like overthrowing foreign governments and assassinations. He says this activity is kept secret even from Congress and [...] "leads to trouble".

40|$|Which impact does {{government}} size have on life satisfaction, {{and how do}} effects <b>of</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>government</b> differ between income {{groups in}} society? Previous studies typically employed country averages and thus neglect possibly heterogeneous happiness effects between income groups. The paper addresses empirically the effects of government spending on subjective well-being of individuals belonging to different income groups. Our analysis is based on individual data from 25 European countries participating in the European Social Survey. In contrast to most previous studies we {{take account of the}} endogeneity between relative income position and reported life satisfaction by an instrumental variable approach. Our results suggest, first, that most government spending categories, including social protection, are on average negatively related to individual well-being. Secondly, estimated marginal effects of health, education and social protection spending at different income levels show that spending increases always have a stronger negative effect on high income groups' well-being than on low income groups' life satisfaction. For all government spending categories, marginal happiness effects of higher public spending are clearly negative for income groups at the top...|$|R
