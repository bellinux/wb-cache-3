5|$|There are densely forested regions around Gangtok, {{consisting}} of temperate, deciduous forests <b>of</b> <b>poplar,</b> birch, oak, and elm, {{as well as}} evergreen, coniferous trees of the wet alpine zone. Orchids are common, and rare varieties of orchids are featured in flower shows in the city. Bamboos are also abundant. In the lower reaches of the town, the vegetation gradually changes from alpine to temperate deciduous and subtropical. Flowers such as sunflower, marigold, poinsettia, and others bloom, especially in November and December.|$|E
5|$|On August 18, 1864, the 21st's three-year {{enlistment}} {{came to an}} end. More {{than three-quarters}} of the remaining men chose to re-enlist. These men were consolidated into a battalion of three companies commanded by Capt. Orange S. Sampson. The day after their consolidation, the battalion participated in the Battle of Globe Tavern. The final engagement in which the remaining companies of the 21st participated as an independent unit was the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Poplar</b> Springs Church on September 30, 1864, during which the Union army attempted to extend its lines westward, further encircling Petersburg. Capt. Orange Sampson, commanding the 21st, was killed in this engagement.|$|E

The route was expanded to a four-lane divided highway and was taken over as MD 5's bypass of Waldorf in 1997.

40|$|Cylinders {{filled with}} Orthic Black Ah {{material}} were leached over a 2 -year period with distilled water or with aqueous extracts of aspen or black poplar leaves that were collected {{late in the}} growing season. Actual losses from the soil and chemical analyses of the leached soil indicated that the aqueous extract <b>of</b> aspen <b>poplar</b> leaves imposed greater changes on the chemical properties of the soil than did the extract <b>of</b> black <b>poplar</b> leaves. These changes were particularly noticeable for pH, total and exchangeable Ca, and 0. 1 N NaOH-extractable C.

40|$|Untill 20 {{years ago}} {{seedlings}} <b>of</b> <b>poplars</b> were rarely {{found in the}} Netherlands. Nowadays, however, they are increasingly numerous, especially in the riverine area. This is probably due to poplar-planting activities, resulting in greater clonal diversity and better mixing of ♂ and ♀ clones with overlapping flowering periods as well for P. x canadensis as for P. nigra. Because backcrossess between P. nigra and P. x canadensis can be formed at sites with spontaneous regeneration, the identification <b>of</b> <b>Poplars</b> at these sites (especially the young trees) can give difficulties.
