The main effort of this offensive hit the British Fifth Army, which formed the right flank of the British front line. Struck a staggering blow, it began a rapid and at times panicked withdrawal. The key railway junction at Amiens was soon threatened.|$|E

5|$|As {{tensions}} between the North and South increased <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> of 1860–1861, Walker equipped himself and began drilling with Major Devens' 3rd Battalion of Rifles in Worcester and New York. Despite his older brother Robert serving in the 34th Massachusetts Infantry, his father objected to his youngest son mobilizing with {{the first wave of}} volunteers. Walker returned to Worcester but began to lobby William Schouler and Governor John Andrew to grant him a commission as a second lieutenant under Devens' command of the 15th Massachusetts. Following his 21st birthday and the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861, Walker secured the consent of his father to join the war effort as well as assurances by Devens that he would receive an officer's commission. However, the lieutenancy never materialized and Devens instead offered Walker an appointment as a sergeant major, which he assumed on August 1, 1861, after re-tailoring his previously ordered lieutenant's uniform to reflect his enlisted status. However, by September 14, 1861, Walker had been recommended by Devens and reassigned to Brig. Gen. Darius N. Couch as assistant adjutant general and promoted to captain. Walker remained in Washington, D.C., <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> of 1861–1862 and did not see combat until May 1862 at the Battle of Williamsburg. Walker also served at Seven Pines {{as well as at the}} Seven Days Battles of the Peninsula Campaign in the summer of 1862 under Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan in the Army of the Potomac.|$|E

5|$|Many Polistes species {{aggregate}} over winter. Polistes exclamans clump {{in rather}} large aggregations while hibernating. “These aggregations are frequently found in protected places called hibernacula {{that can be}} as varied as crevices and cracks of rocks or trunks, beneath the bark of trees, between walls of buildings, or any other natural or artificial structures that provides protection during hibernation.” Although Polistes exclamans {{have been found in}} organ-pipe muddauber nests, a mud nest that can provide a certain level of protection, it is not thought to actually house hibernating Polistes exclamans <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter.</b>|$|E

By 1 June 1944, the Navy had transferred all its aircraft to the PVO, which reported only 17 on its own strength, {{and all of those}} were gone by 1 January 1945. Undoubtedly more remained in training units and the like, but none were assigned to combat units by then.|$|E
