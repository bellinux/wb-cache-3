40|$|A {{microbial}} surfactant (biosurfactant) {{was investigated}} for {{its potential to}} enhance bioavailability and, hence, the biodegradation of <b>octadecane.</b> The rhamnolipid biosurfactant {{used in this study}} was extracted from culture supernatants after growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027 in phosphate-limited proteose peptone-glucose-ammonium salts medium. Dispersion of <b>octadecane</b> in aqueous solutions was dramatically enhanced by 300 mg of the rhamnolipid biosurfactant per liter, increasing by a factor of more than 4 orders of magnitude, from 0. 009 to > 250 mg/liter. The relative enhancement of <b>octadecane</b> dispersion was much greater at low rhamnolipid concentrations than at high concentrations. Rhamnolipid-enhanced <b>octadecane</b> dispersion was found to be dependent on pH and shaking speed. Biodegradation experiments done with an initial <b>octadecane</b> concentration of 1, 500 mg/liter showed that 20 % of the <b>octadecane</b> was mineralized in 84 h in the presence of 300 mg of rhamnolipid per liter, compared with only 5 % <b>octadecane</b> mineralization when no surfactant was present. These results indicate that rhamnolipids may have potential for facilitating the bioremediation of sites contaminated with hydrocarbons having limited water solubility...|$|E
40|$|Citral {{stability}} in oil-in-water emulsions at pH 3. 0 with solid or liquid <b>octadecane</b> was determined. Citral degradation was faster in anionic {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (SDS) -stabilized emulsions than non-ionic polyoxyethylene (23) lauryl ether (Brij) -stabilized emulsions. Crystallization of <b>octadecane</b> in both Brij- and SDS-stabilized emulsion droplets resulted in faster degradation of citral. Crystallization of <b>octadecane</b> in emulsion droplets increased citral partitioning into the aqueous phase, with 41 - 53 % of the total citral in the aqueous phase when <b>octadecane</b> was solid compared to 18 - 25 % when <b>octadecane</b> was liquid. This research suggests that factors that increase partitioning of citral out of the droplets of oil-in-water emulsions increase citral degradation rates. These {{results suggest that the}} stability of citral could be increased in oil-in-water emulsions by technologies that decrease its partitioning and exposure to acidic aqueous phases...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to examine the influence of the physical state of lipids on iron-promoted oxidation of methyl linolenate in <b>octadecane</b> oil-in-water emulsions. <b>Octadecane</b> and methyl linolenate oil-in-water emulsions were prepared that contained droplets having the <b>octadecane</b> as either liquid or solid. The physical state of the <b>octadecane</b> was confirmed by a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The effect of the physical state of the lipid on oxidation rates was determined as a function of iron concentration (80 and 160 μM), pH (3. 0 or 7. 0), emulsifier type, and cooling rate. Oxidation of methyl linolenate was determined by lipid hydroperoxides and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Emulsions containing solid <b>octadecane</b> had higher rates of lipid hydroperoxide and TBARS formation than those containing liquid <b>octadecane.</b> The rate at which the emulsions were cooled had no influence on oxidation rates. Oxidation rates in both emulsions increased with increasing iron concentration and decreasing pH. Oxidation rates were lowest in emulsions with cationic droplet membranes (dodecyl trimethylammonium bromide-stabilized), presumably due to the repulsion of iron from the oxidizable methyl linolenate in the emulsion droplet core. These results suggest that upon crystallization of <b>octadecane,</b> the liquid methyl linolenate migrated to the emulsion droplet surface, where it was more prone to oxidation because it was in closer contact with the iron ions in the aqueous phase...|$|E
30|$|The initial {{configuration}} {{of the system is}} built by <b>octadecane</b> molecules packing inside the silica channel. Forty <b>octadecane</b> molecules are inserted into the slit channel with a width of 2  nm, leading to a density of 0.8  g/cm 3. We also study transportation properties of pyridine and phenol molecules, another two components of shale oil, to investigate the effect of oil molecules on oil transportation in nanochannel. The structures of <b>octadecane,</b> pyridine, and phenol are extracted from the database of the Material Studio software, as shown in Fig.  1 b–d. To ensure a similar density of oil, the numbers of pyridine molecules, phenol molecules, and <b>octadecane</b> molecules in channels with widths of 4 and 6  nm in our simulations are 407, 344, 80, and 120, respectively.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} these results, we calculate {{the energy of the}} total interaction, vdW interaction, and electrostatic interaction between the different components and the channel. The histogram in Fig.  8 illustrates that the total interaction energy between phenol (pyridine) and silica substrate is larger than that between <b>octadecane</b> and silica channel. Because <b>octadecane</b> molecule is a chain, non-polar molecule, the total interaction between the <b>octadecane</b> molecules and the channel results mainly from vdW interaction, and there is little electrostatic interaction, while the contributions of vdW interaction and electrostatic interaction between phenol (pyridine) and the channel to the total interaction are nearly same.|$|E
3000|$|In this work, we {{investigated}} the photoionization and fragmentation behavior of <b>octadecane</b> using infrared laser desorption/tunable VUV PIMS (IRLD/VUV PIMS) and theoretical calculations. The photoionization mass spectra of <b>octadecane</b> were obtained at different photon energies. The ionization energy (IE) of <b>octadecane</b> and appearance energy (AE) of fragments {{were obtained by}} measuring the photoionization efficiency (PIE) spectrum. Furthermore, the major dissociation pathways to form radical C n H 2 n+ 1 + [...] (n =  4 – 11) and alkene C n H 2 n [...] + [...] (n =  5 – 10) fragments were presented {{on the basis of}} density functional theory calculations.|$|E

The major drawbacks such as limited thermal conductivity and leakage prevent the PCMs from wide application in desired areas. In this work, an environmentally friendly and low cost approach, layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly technique, was applied to build up ultrathin shells to encapsulate the PCMs and therefore to regulate their changes in volume when the phase change occurs. Generally, the oppositely charged strong polyelectrolytes Poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) and Poly(4 -styrenesulfonic acid) sodium salt (PSS) were employed to fabricate multilayer shells on emulsified <b>octadecane</b> droplets using either bovine serum albumin (BSA) or sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as surfactant. Specifically, using BSA as the surfactant, polyelectrolyte encapsulated <b>octadecane</b> spheres in size of ∼ 500 [*]nm were obtained, with good shell integrity, high <b>octadecane</b> content (91. 3 % by mass), and good thermal stability after cycles of thermal treatments...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of {{thermal energy storage}} with phase change materials (PCMs) for energy efficiency of buildings grew rapidly {{in the last few}} years. In this research, <b>octadecane</b> paraffin was served as a PCM, and a structural concrete with the function of indoor temperature control was developed by using a macro-encapsulated PCM hollow steel ball (HSB). The macro-encapsulated PCM-HSB was prepared by incorporation of <b>octadecane</b> into HSBs through vacuum impregnation. Test results showed that the maximum percentage of <b>octadecane</b> carried by HSBs was 80. 3 % by mass. The macro-encapsulated PCM-HSB has a latent heat storage capacity as high as 200. 5 J/g. The compressive strength of concrete with macro-encapsulated PCM-HSB at 28 days ranged from 22 to 40 MPa. The indoor thermal performance test revealed that concrete with macro-encapsulated octadecane-HSB was capable of reducing the peak indoor air temperature and the fluctuation of indoor temperature. It can be very effective in transferring the heating and cooling loads away from the peak demand times...|$|E
3000|$|The photoionization and {{fragmentation}} of <b>octadecane</b> {{have been investigated}} with IRLD/VUV PIMS and theoretical calculations. The ionization energy of <b>octadecane</b> {{was measured to be}} 9.54  ±  0.05  eV and calculated to be 9.46  eV. The main fragment ions were assigned to radical ions (C n H 2 n+ 1 +, n =  4 – 11) and alkene ions (C n H 2 n [...] +, n =  5 – 10). The AEs of fragment ions were obtained by measuring the photoionization efficiency spectrum. The AE values of both C n H 2 n+ 1 + [...] and C n H 2 n + [...] decrease with the increase of the number of C atom. The radical ions C n H 2 n+ 1 + [...] are formed through a direct cleavage of C–C bond in <b>octadecane,</b> while yielding alkene ions C n H 2 n [...] + [...] needs to experience a β-H shift process. This work could be considered as an approach of a combination of IRLD/VUV PIMS and theoretical calculations to research of petroleum.|$|E
40|$|A {{study to}} {{quantify}} the effect of rhamnolipid biosurfactant structure {{on the degradation of}} alkanes by a variety of Pseudomonas isolates was conducted. Two dirhamnolipids were studied, a methyl ester form (dR-Me) and an acid form (dR-A). These rhamnolipids have different properties with respect to interfacial tension, solubility, and charge. For example, the interfacial tension between hexadecane and water was decreased to < 0. 1 dyne/cm by the dR-Me but was only decreased to 5 dyne/cm by the dR-A. Solubilization and biodegradation of two alkanes in different physical states, liquid and solid, were determined at dirhamnolipid concentrations ranging from 0. 01 to 0. 1 mM (7 to 70 mg/liter). The dR-Me markedly enhanced hexadecane (liquid) and <b>octadecane</b> (solid) degradation by seven different Pseudomonas strains. For an eighth strain tested, which exhibited extremely high cell surface hydrophobicity, hexadecane degradation was enhanced but <b>octadecane</b> degradation was inhibited. The dR-A also enhanced hexadecane degradation by all degraders but did so more modestly than the dR-Me.

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of a {{purified}} rhamnolipid biosurfactant on the hydrophobicity of octadecane-degrading cells was investigated to determine whether differences in rates of <b>octadecane</b> biodegradation resulting from the addition of rhamnolipid to four strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa could be related to measured differences in hydrophobicity. Cell hydrophobicity was determined by a modified bacterial adherence to hydrocarbon (BATH) assay. Bacterial adherence to hydrocarbon quantitates the preference of cell surfaces for the aqueous phase or the aqueous-hexadecane interface in a two-phase system of water and hexadecane. On the basis of <b>octadecane</b> biodegradation in the absence of rhamnolipid, the four bacterial strains were divided into two groups: the fast degraders (ATCC 15442 and ATCC 27853), which had high cell hydrophobicities (74 and 55 % adherence to hexadecane, respectively), and the slow degraders (ATCC 9027 and NRRL 3198), which had low cell hydrophobicities (27 and 40 %, respectively). Although in all cases rhamnolipid increased the aqueous dispersion of <b>octadecane</b> at least 10 (4) -fold, at low rhamnolipid concentrations (0. 6 mM), biodegradation by all four strains was initially inhibited for at least 100 h relative to controls. At high rhamnolipid concentrations (6 mM), biodegradation by the fast degraders was slightly inhibited relative to controls, but the biodegradation by the slow degraders was enhanced relative to controls. Measurement of cell hydrophobicity showed that rhamnolipids increased the cell hydrophobicity of the slow degraders but had no effect on the cell hydrophobicity of the fast degraders. The rate at which the cells became hydrophobic was found to depend on the rhamnolipid concentration and was directly related to the rate of <b>octadecane</b> biodegradation.

40|$|We {{conducted}} {{a study of the}} relationship between the dissolution rates of organic compounds that are sparingly soluble in water and the biodegradation of these compounds by mixed cultures of bacteria. The rates of dissolution of naphthalene and 4 -chlorobiphenyl were directly related to their surface areas. The bacteria caused a decline in the concentration of the soluble substrate. The rate of bacterial growth fell abruptly when 4 -chlorobiphenyl or naphthalene was no longer detectable in solution. The population continued to increase in media with different surface areas of insoluble 4 -chlorobiphenyl, but the final counts were higher in media in which the surface areas of the substrate were larger. The rates of dissolution of palmitic acid, <b>octadecane,</b> di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate, and 1 -naphthyl N-methylcarbamate were determined in the absence of microorganisms. A mixed culture of microorganisms mineralized palmitic acid, di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate, and Sevin (1 -naphthyl N-methylcarbamate) at a logarithmic rate, but <b>octadecane</b> mineralization was linear. The rates of mineralization at the end of the active phase of the biodegradation were lower than the rate of dissolution of palmitic acid but higher than the rate of dissolution of <b>octadecane</b> in the uninoculated medium.

40|$|Phase change {{materials}} (PCMs) {{have been}} considered as an innovative technology that can reduce the peak loads and heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) energy consumption in buildings. Basically they are substances capable of storing or releasing thermal energy as latent heat. Because the amount of latent heat absorbed or released is {{much larger than the}} sensible heat, the application of PCMs in buildings has significant potential to reduce energy consumption. However, because each PCM has its own phase change temperature, which is the temperature at which latent heat is absorbed or released, it is important to use an appropriate PCM for the purpose of building envelope design. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the energy saving potentials in buildings when various PCMs with different phase change temperatures are applied to a lightweight building envelope by analyzing the thermal load characteristics. As results, the annual heating load increased at every phase change temperature, but the peak heating load decreased by 3. 19 % with heptadecane (phase change temperature 21 °C), and the lowest indoor temperature increased by 0. 86 °C with heptadecane (phase change temperature 21 °C). The annual cooling load decreased by 1. 05 % with dodecanol (phase change temperature 24 °C), the peak cooling load decreased by 1. 30 % with <b>octadecane</b> (phase change temperature 29 °C), and the highest indoor temperature dropped by 0. 50 °C with <b>octadecane</b> (phase change temperature 29 °C).

It is not known with certainty at what chain length the linear conformation {{is no longer the}} global minimum. To clarify this point, we use ab initio and density functional methods to compute the relative energies of the linear and hairpin alkane conformers for increasing chain lengths. Extensive electronic structure calculations are performed to obtain optimized geometries, harmonic frequencies and accurate single point energies for the selected alkane conformers from octane through <b>octadecane.</b> Benchmark CCSD(T) /cc-pVTZ single point calculations are performed for chains through tetradecane, while approximate methods are required for the longer chains up to <b>octadecane.</b> Using frozen natural orbitals to unambiguously truncate the virtual orbital space, we are able to compute composite CCSD FNO(T) single point energies for all the chain lengths. This approximate composite method has significant computational savings compared to full CCSD(T) while retaining ∼ 0. 15 kcal/mol accuracy compared to the benchmark results. More approximate dual-basis resolution-of-the-identity double-hybrid DFT calculations are also performed and shown to have reasonable 0. 2 - 0. 4 kcal/mol errors compared with our benchmark values.

The catalytic effects of several molybdenum-, cobalt-, and iron-containing compounds have been examined in the hydrogenation and hydrodesulfurization reactions of dibenzothiophene (DBT) under conditions related to coal liquefaction. The metal compounds are candidate catalyst precursors for direct coal liquefaction. The reactions were carried out in batch microautoclave reactors at 400 {degrees}C for 30 minutes with 6. 9 MPa (cold) hydrogen pressure, and tridecane solvent. A metal loading of 0. 5 mol% resulted in low conversion and only hydrogenation. Addition of sulfur in 4 : 1 molar ratio led only to a minor increase in conversion and hydrodesulfurization. The use of a higher boiling solvent (<b>octadecane</b> vs. tridecane) was beneficial in providing increased conversion, hydrodesulfurization, and hydrogenation. An increase in metal compound loading to 36. 2 mol% led to a dramatic increase in conversion, hydrodesulfurization, and hydrocracking. Molybdenum hexacarbonyl at 36 mol% loading, with added sulfur at 6 : 1 ratio and <b>octadecane</b> solvent, gave 100 % conversion of dibenzothiophene to other products with 100 % hydrodesulfurization. Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate and molybdenum(III) chloride are less active under similar conditions. A cobalt-molybdenum thiocubane complex gave unexpectedly low conversions. Iron and cobalt carbonyls also provided very low conversions, even with added sulfur...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical simulation of melting of chemically pure material in two-dimensional square cavity. A single-domain model is used whichdoes not require interface tracking {{and allows the}} use of a fixed grid inorder to solve governing transport equations. However, a fully conservative control volume method, using r-adaptive moving grid, is implemented to enhancethe precision. Simple, user-defined function is introduced to control the density of the grid generated with a robust elliptic generator. The simulation is tested extensively on a one-dimensional phase change problem which enables the comparison of the results with a existing analytical solution. Finally, the method is assessed on cases corresponding to melting oftin and <b>octadecane</b> driven by natural convection...|$|E
