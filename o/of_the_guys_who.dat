500|$|Pausch {{then went}} to the first part of his speech, {{explaining}} his childhood dreams and how he accomplished (or tried to accomplish) them. Pausch first explained his childhood, as well as his family life in the 1960s. Pausch stated that he had a [...] "really good childhood", and, when going back through his family archive of photographs, had never found a picture of him not smiling. Some of these pictures were shown on the projection as slides, including one of him dreaming. He explained how he was inspired by the Apollo 11 lunar landing in 1969. Pausch then transitioned to a slide which contained a list of his childhood dreams, and explained them. His dreams were being in zero gravity, playing in the National Football League, being the author of a World Book Encyclopedia article, being Captain Kirk, being [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> won the big stuffed animals in the amusement park", and becoming a Disney Imagineer.|$|E
500|$|Davies {{believed}} that Lee's film did not overcome [...] "the problem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> get the girls not seeming quite good enough", {{and set out}} {{to try to find a}} way of making them into heroes in his script. He said that Austen should have made the reader feel that Edward was worthy of Elinor and explained how Marianne falls in love with Colonel Brandon, after having her heart broken by Willoughby. The writer increased the male roles, so they could be turned into stronger characters. Davies told Hill that the team [...] "worked very hard" [...] on the men. Brandon is seen rescuing people and doing a lot of fast horse riding, while Edward was given a wood-chopping scene where he vents his frustrations about his engagement. Davies also made the Dashwood sisters younger and [...] "more vulnerable" [...] than how they were portrayed in Lee's film. Hattie Morahan, who portrayed Elinor in the drama, stated, [...] "We are trying to play the story as it was written. In the novel the girls are 19 and 17, so these romantic relationships are real rites of passage for them." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{takes place}} {{simultaneously}} with {{the events of}} The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2, the latter of which is set {{six months after the}} events of Iron Man, Clark Gregg, who appeared in Iron Man and Iron Man 2 as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson, reprised the role in Thor. About his role in Thor he stated, [...] "Agent Coulson was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> wasn't really in the comic books, and he [...] a very kind of small role in Iron Man. And I was just very lucky that they chose to expand that character and [...] to put him more into the universe of it." [...] After signing on to appear as Clint Barton / Hawkeye in The Avengers, Jeremy Renner made a cameo appearance as the character during a scene in Thor. Branagh said that they [...] "were always going to have a guy in a basket above the action where Thor breaks in the S.H.I.E.L.D. camp", and that he was thrilled when the producers told him they wanted to use Renner's Hawkeye for that role. The film ends with a post-credits scene featuring Loki, watching as Erik Selvig and Nick Fury discuss the Tesseract. The scene was directed by Joss Whedon, who directed The Avengers. Stellan Skarsgård, who played Selvig, said the scene was not included when he first read the screenplay for Thor, and that he was sent pages for the scene after agreeing to appear in The Avengers.|$|E
500|$|Following the show's {{cancellation}} in 2002, Rogen did not {{get many}} auditions, which was not upsetting {{to him as he}} always thought he would achieve better success as a writer. He would soon be a part of Apatow's [...] "frat pack", a close-knit group that includes Steve Carell and Paul Rudd. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> awkwardness <b>of</b> a grown man spending so much time with a teenaged Rogen, Apatow said: [...] "I'm such a comedy fan that, even though he's16, I know I'm hanging out with one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>who's</b> going to be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great comics." [...] Around this time, Apatow would come up with odd requests for Rogen and Goldberg, such as turn an idea of his into a movie in 10 days and come up with 100 one-page ideas for films. Regarding Apatow's professional effect on Rogen, the actor said in 2009, [...] "Obviously, I can't stress how important Judd's been to my career".|$|R
25|$|The single's {{official}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Herb Ritts. The music video features two parts which frequently interchange back and forth throughout the song. <b>The</b> first part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> video shows Lopez having a small party in her home with guests including Ja Rule and Ashanti. This part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> video is from <b>the</b> point <b>of</b> view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> is being mentioned in the song. His face is not seen, and Lopez addresses the camera throughout this section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> video. This section begins with <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> knocking on <b>the</b> door, Lopez inviting him in, and then eventually showing him the door when she sees him attempting to look/flirt with other women at the party. As he leaves, she goes on entertaining the other guests. <b>The</b> second part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> video involves scenes with Lopez, Ja Rule and Cadillac tah in a white room, Ja Rule in a recording studio in Lopez's home, Lopez {{sitting in a chair}} singing bits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song, and Lopez and Ja Rule singing <b>the</b> parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> final verse against a gold backdrop.|$|R

50|$|Despite their {{reputation}} as a killer band live, Richard Branson decided that after two albums without major success that he would only offer Donnelly / Karski a continuous deal. <b>The</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band became redundant, and ironically months later the 'Local lads' album went gold in Australia. However, the deed had been done, and Donnelly resorted to taking a scratch band to do the hit tour in Australia much to <b>the</b> chagrin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> had put all the hard studio and roadwork in to get the band where it was.|$|R
2500|$|Trump allowed O'Brien {{to visit}} his offices to {{research}} his financial records. According to O'Brien, the financial documents were of no help for determining Trump's net worth. O'Brien spoke with three people who worked with Trump for years and who believed his net worth to be between $150 million and $250 million. O'Brien said he was told by Trump, [...] "You {{can go ahead and}} speak to <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> have 400-pound wives at home who are jealous <b>of</b> me, but <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> really know me know I'm a great builder." ...|$|R

I never thought they'd cast me—- I mean, I thought they'd go with one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> look like me but are movie stars". He {{believes}} that an actor with a [...] "proven track record" [...] would likely have been chosen if another network had broadcast the show. He went through numerous auditions; each time he explained to the casting directors what he could bring to the character, if given the part. Alan Taylor and Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner initially thought Hamm was too handsome for the role but ultimately decided, [...] "it was perfect to cast sort <b>of</b> <b>the</b> perfect male in this part". Weiner also sensed that the actor had suffered early loss of his parents, which was similar to Draper's backstory.|$|R

2500|$|Former wrestler Christopher Nowinski {{stated that}} Benoit {{may have been}} {{suffering}} from repeated, untreated concussions throughout his wrestling career, ultimately leading to an unstable mental state. Nowinski {{was quoted as saying}} that Benoit [...] "was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> only <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> would take a chair shot to <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head... which is stupid". Tests conducted on Benoit's brain by Julian Bailes, <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> neurosurgery at West Virginia University, showed [...] "Benoit's brain was so severely damaged it resembled <b>the</b> brain <b>of</b> an 85-year-old Alzheimer's patient". Other tests conducted on Benoit's brain tissue revealed severe chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and damage to all four lobes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain and brain stem. Bailes and his colleagues concluded that repeated concussions can lead to dementia, which can contribute to severe behavioral problems. Benoit's father said that brain damage may have been <b>the</b> leading cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> double murder-suicide. A statement released by WWE dismissed this idea as [...] "speculative".|$|R
2500|$|The {{atmosphere}} at Edgbaston is {{reputed to be}} the most hostile in England for visiting teams. Former England captain Alec Stewart recalled [...] "On a world level I would put it up there with Eden Gardens in Calcutta, which holds about 100,000. It inspires a team. It's like having another man in your side." [...] and the former England wicketkeeper Geraint Jones describes how [...] "The crowd here makes such a big noise when you are doing well ... it's a unique environment." [...] After winning the 2015 Ashes Test Match with Australia at Edgbaston, England captain Alastair Cook commented [...] "The Edgbaston crowd was up there with the loudest I can remember.

2500|$|Cornell {{said that}} [...] "Hands All Over" [...] {{is about how}} humans defile the environment, and that [...] "Full on Kevin's Mom" [...] is about [...] "a {{friend of mine who}} slept with another friend <b>of</b> mine's mom. <b>The</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> did it said to us, 'Yeah, full on Kevin's mom'." [...] <b>The</b> lyrics <b>of</b> [...] "I Awake" [...] were {{originally}} part of a note written by Yamamoto's then girlfriend Kate McDonald. In the late 1990s, an urban legend circulated on internet message boards which stated that Yamamoto, after writing the music, wrote some lyrics on <b>the</b> back side <b>of</b> McDonald's note. When Yamamoto gave the paper containing these lyrics to Cornell, Cornell looked at <b>the</b> wrong side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sheet and believed McDonald's note was the lyrics to Yamamoto's song. There was less material on the album intended as humorous compared with Ultramega OK. However, the song [...] "Big Dumb Sex" [...] was written as a parody of glam metal bands, who often metaphorically addressed sexual intercourse in their lyrics. The song, with its many uses of [...] "fuck", was the reason the album gained a Parental Advisory sticker upon release.|$|R
