40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{describe}} {{the range of}} neuromuscular disorders which {{may be associated with}} cryptic coeliac disease.  METHODS—Nine patients were described with neuromuscular disorders associated with circulating antigliadin antibodies, whose duodenal biopsies later confirmed the diagnosis of coeliac disease. Neurological symptoms antedated the diagnosis of coeliac disease in all, and most had minimal or no gastrointestinal symptoms {{at the onset of the}} neuromuscular disorder.  RESULTS—Three patients had sensorimotor axonal peripheral neuropathy, <b>one</b> <b>had</b> axonal motor peripheral neuropathy, <b>one</b> <b>had</b> probable inclusion body myositis and axonal motor peripheral neuropathy, <b>one</b> <b>had</b> polymyositis and sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy, <b>one</b> <b>had</b> mononeuropathy multiplex, <b>one</b> <b>had</b> neuromyotonia, and <b>one</b> <b>had</b> polyneuropathy.  CONCLUSION—A wide range of neuromuscular disease may be the presenting feature of coeliac disease. This represents the first report of inclusion body myositis and neuromyotonia associated with coeliac disease. Estimation of circulating antigliadin antibodies should be considered in all patients with neuromuscular disease of otherwise obscure aetiology. ...|$|R

In the 1860s, New Zealand was a developing country, where materials and resources freely available in Europe were conspicuous by their absence. When available they were often of inferior quality, as Mountfort discovered with the unseasoned wood in his first disastrous project.

However, he soon adapted, and developed his skill in working with crude and unrefined materials.|$|E
