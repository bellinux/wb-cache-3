5|$|Sandgrouse are principally seed eaters. Other {{food items}} eaten include green shoots and leaves, bulbs and berries. Insect food such as ants and {{termites}} may be eaten {{especially during the}} breeding season. The diet of many sandgrouse is highly specialised, with the seeds of {{a small number of}} plant species being dominant. This may depend on local availability but in other cases it reflects actual selection of favoured seeds over others by the sandgrouse. Seeds <b>of</b> <b>leguminous</b> <b>plants</b> are usually {{an important part of the}} diet. In agricultural areas oats and other grain are readily taken. Seeds are either collected from the ground or directly from the plants. Foraging techniques vary between species that coexist which reduces competition; in Namibia, double-banded sandgrouse feed slowly and methodically whilst Namaqua sandgrouse feed rapidly, exploring loose soil with their beaks and flicking it away sideways. Grit is also swallowed to help grind up food in the gizzard.|$|E
25|$|Larvae feed on {{a variety}} <b>of</b> <b>leguminous</b> <b>plants,</b> namely Faboideae (Trifolium pratense, Medicago sativa, Medicago lappacea, Medicago hispida, Medicago polymorpha, Medicago sulcata, Vicia, Lotus, Onobrychis, Astragalus, Colutea arborescens, Hippocrepis, and Anthyllis species). In the UK wild and {{cultivated}} clovers (Trifolium) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) are favourites; less frequently, common bird's-foot trefoil Lotus corniculatus is eaten.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of species within many genera <b>of</b> <b>leguminous</b> <b>plants,</b> e.g. Astragalus, Coronilla, Hippocrepis, Indigofera, Lotus, Securigera and Scorpiurus, produce {{chemicals}} that derive from the compound 3-nitropropanoic acid (3-NPA, beta-nitropropionic acid). The free acid 3-NPA is an irreversible inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration, and thus the compound inhibits the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This inhibition caused by 3-NPA is especially toxic to nerve cells and represents a very general toxic mechanism suggesting a profound ecological importance due to the big number of species producing this compound and its derivatives. A second and closely related class of secondary metabolites that occur in many species <b>of</b> <b>leguminous</b> <b>plants</b> is defined by isoxazolin-5-one derivatives. These compounds occur in particular together with 3-NPA and related derivatives {{at the same time}} in the same species, as found in Astragalus canadensis and Astragalus collinus. 3-NPA and isoxazlin-5-one derivatives also occur in many species of leaf beetles (see defense in insects).|$|E

50|$|Vicia orobus is {{a species}} <b>of</b> <b>leguminous</b> <b>plant</b> in the genus Vicia, known as wood bitter-vetch. It {{is found in}} Atlantic areas of Europe, {{especially}} in the rocky edges of seasonally-grazed fields. It grows up to 60 cm tall, and has no tendrils {{at the ends of}} its pinnate leaves. Its flowers are white with purple veins, and are borne in groups of 6 or more.|$|R
25|$|The {{hemolymph}} toxins {{originate from}} autogenous de novo biosynthesis by the Chrysomelina beetle. Essential amino acids as valine serve as precursors {{for the production}} of the hemolymph toxins of Chrysomelina leaf beetles. The degradation of such essential amino acids provides propanoyl-CoA. This compound is further transformed into propanoic acid and β-alanine. The amino group in β-alanine is then oxidized to yield either an oxime or the nitro-toxin 3-nitropropanoic acid (3-NPA). The oxime is cyclized to isoxazolin-5-one, which is transformed with α-UDP-glucose into the isoxazolin-5-one glucoside. In a final step, an ester is formed by transesterification of 3-nitropropanoyl-CoA to the 6´-position of isoxazolin-5-one glucoside. This biosynthetic route yields high millimolar concentrations of the secondary isoxazolin-5-one and 3-NPA derived metabolites. Free 3-NPA and glucosides that derive from 3-NPA and isoxazolin-5-one also occur in many genera <b>of</b> <b>leguminous</b> <b>plants</b> (Fabaceae).|$|E
2500|$|Hemoglobin and hemoglobin-like {{molecules}} {{are also}} found in many invertebrates, fungi, and plants. In these organisms, hemoglobins may carry oxygen, or they may act to transport and regulate other small molecules and ions such as carbon dioxide, nitric oxide, hydrogen sulfide and sulfide. A variant of the molecule, called leghemoglobin, is used to scavenge oxygen away from [...] systems, such as the nitrogen-fixing nodules <b>of</b> <b>leguminous</b> <b>plants,</b> before the oxygen can poison (deactivate) the system.|$|E

40|$|Transport {{along the}} {{secretory}} pathway is largely signal-mediated. Proteins in the secretory pathway can be covalently modified with various carbohydrate structures, most commonly O-glycans, N-glycans and/or proteoglycans. Carbohydrate modifications {{can change the}} physical properties of proteins or can function as specific recognition epitopes. Glycosylation can act as an apical sorting signal in polarized epithelial cells and provide a signal for surface transport in non-polarized fibroblasts.

The isolation and identification of different slow growing and fast growing rhizobial strains from the nodules <b>of</b> two <b>leguminous</b> <b>plant</b> species. Symbiotic nitrogen fixing Rhizobium spp. was isolated from (Lablab purpureus and Vigna sinensis). Nodules samples were collected from plants growing in different Districts of Bangladesh and the Glucose-Peptone Agar (GPA), Congo red, Yeast Mannitol Agar (YMA) containing 2 % NaCl were employed to make presumptive decisions on the recognition and classification of the isolated bacterial strains. All the isolates were found with poor absorption of dye Congo red and little or no growth on the media of GPA and without altering the pH. Almost all of the isolates exhibit growth on 2 % NaCl, poor growth on GPA, thus confirming the rhizobia. After biochemical tests like catalase test and citrate utilization test isolates were confirmed as Rhizobia.
