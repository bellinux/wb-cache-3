Sakate adapted several of Chekhov's plays and transformed them in the general style of nō. Nagai also adapted Chekhov's plays, including Three Sisters, and transformed his dramatic style into Nagai's style of satirical realism while emphasising the social issues depicted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>play.</b>|$|E

The composer's use of atonal musical language, octatonic scales and the occasional tonal passage are directly linked with the various emotions of the characters and the unfolding of the drama.|$|E

5|$|Early {{into his}} fourth {{season with the}} Canucks, Kesler was {{cross-checked}} in the face by Flyers forward Jesse Boulerice. The cross-check was an immediate response to Kesler hitting Flyers defenseman Randy Jones and resulted in Kesler leaving {{the game with a}} sore jaw. Boulerice was subsequently suspended for 25 games, matching the then largest suspension in NHL history. Later in the season, Kesler was involved in another violent on-ice incident when Anaheim Ducks defenseman Chris Pronger used his skate blade to stomp on Kesler's calf. Kesler was not injured <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>play.</b> Although the NHL originally announced that Pronger would not receive a suspension <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> he later received an eight-game suspension when new video emerged of the incident. Over the course of the season, Kesler established himself as a solid two-way center, scoring what was then a career high 21 goals and 37 points and playing a regular shutdown role against opposing teams' top players and on the penalty kill with linemate Alexandre Burrows.|$|E

Hawks again worked with Seton Miller on the script about a Middle Eastern prince who has {{an affair with a}} Parisienne showgirl and cast Charles Farrell as the prince and Greta Nissen as Fabienne. Hawks went both over schedule and over budget on the film, which began a rift between him and Sol Wurtzel that would eventually lead to Hawks leaving Fox. The film was finished in August 1927, though it was not released until June 1928.|$|E

In the second, Alabama reached the end zone {{for the first time on}} the evening after Greg McElroy hit Marquis Maze for a 45-yard touchdown reception and a 13–3 lead. After a punt on the next Bulldog series, an 80-yard Maze touchdown return was called back as a result of an illegal block <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> by Alex Watkins. On the next play, Mark Ingram took a short bubble screen pass from McElroy 78-yards for a 20–3 lead at the half.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{returned}} Tech's kickoff to the Texas 21-yard line, and the Longhorns' offense {{took the}} field.

Mitchell gained four yards on a running play, then Texas was penalized for having an ineligible player downfield. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> after the penalty, Texas was penalized for an illegal formation, negating a completed pass for a first down. The Longhorns then faced a third down and 11, but Brown's third-down pass was knocked down and the Longhorns punted to end their final possession of the first half.|$|E
5|$|After {{just two}} weeks of rehearsals, the play opened at the Boston Museum on May 9, 1887, as the first American {{adaptation}} of Stevenson's novella. On May 14, it closed for rewrites. The updated version, produced by A. M. Palmer, opened at the Madison Square Theatre on Broadway on September 12 of that year. Sullivan invited Stevenson, who {{had moved to the}} U.S. that summer; Stevenson was ill, but his wife and mother attended and congratulated Sullivan <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>play.</b> The Madison Square production closed on October 1, when Mansfield took his company on a nationwide tour. The tour began at the Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia and visited over a dozen cities, including several returns to Boston and New York. It ended at the Madison Square Theatre, where Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was performed for a final season matinee on June 29, 1888.|$|E
