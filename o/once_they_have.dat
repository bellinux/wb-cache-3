5|$|As {{this tournament}} takes {{place during the}} same time period as the NHL's Stanley Cup playoffs, NHL players {{generally}} only become available if their respective NHL team did not make the playoffs, or <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been eliminated from Stanley Cup contention. It is therefore common for several NHL players to join the World Championships while the tournament is already in progress.|$|E
5|$|<b>Once</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{been seen}} by a {{predator}} they commonly try to escape, {{but they can also}} use distraction with an ink cloud ejected from the ink sac. The ink is thought to reduce the efficiency of olfactory organs, which would aid evasion from predators that employ smell for hunting, such as sharks. Ink clouds of some species might act as pseudomorphs, or decoys that the predator attacks instead.|$|E
5|$|<b>Once</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{collected}} nectar and pollen, female workers {{return to}} the nest and deposit the harvest into brood cells, or into wax cells for storage. Unlike honeybees, bumblebees only store a few days' worth of food, so are much more vulnerable to food shortages. Male bumblebees collect only nectar and do so to feed themselves. They may visit quite different flowers from the workers because of their different nutritional needs.|$|E

50|$|At Phang Nga Elephant Park, teams must collect {{pineapple}} {{leaves to}} feed the elephants. <b>Once</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> gathered enough pineapple leaves, they must go through a marked path and bring an elephant from the river by riding on the elephant to the feeding area. <b>Once</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> fed the elephants, they would receive their next clue.|$|R

5|$|Beagles are {{intelligent}} but, as {{a result}} of being bred for the long chase, are single-minded and determined, which can make them hard to train. They can be difficult to recall <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> picked up a scent, and are easily distracted by smells around them. They do not generally feature in obedience trials; while they are alert, respond well to food-reward training, and are eager to please, they are easily bored or distracted. They are ranked 72nd in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, as Coren places them among the group with the lowest degree of working/obedience intelligence. Coren's scale, however, does not assess understanding, independence, or creativity.|$|E
5|$|During a song, avatars of {{the virtual}} band, {{including}} one character selected by the player, will perform {{in time to the}} music, responding appropriately to the unleashing of Star Power or the failing of a song. Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock has a cast of thirteen characters, which the player can further customize with alternate guitar skins and stage outfits using in-game money earned from successful performances. The player can access the game's three boss characters—Tom Morello, Slash, and Lou the Devil—as playable characters <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> completed their respective Boss Battles in Career mode. Although Bret Michaels appears in the game and sings specific songs, he is not a playable character in the game.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay in Popotan {{follows a}} semi-predetermined plot; major events remain the same, but {{personal}} storylines can diverge from the player's choices. The game focuses on protagonist Chris, a drifter who meets three girls and their maid in a mansion near {{the ruins of}} Tokyo in the distant future. The player's {{goal is to make}} available sexual scenes and images that the player can view or replay at any time depicting the protagonist having sexual intercourse with one of the girls. The player can pursue other girls <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> finished one of the sisters' storylines.|$|E

5|$|Helicoverpa zea earns its {{nickname}} {{the corn}} earworm for its widely known destruction of cornfields. The corn earworm feeds on {{every part of}} corn, including the kernels. Severe feeding {{at the tip of}} kernels allows entry for diseases and mold growth. Larvae begin feeding on the kernels <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> reached third instar. Larvae penetrate 9 to 15cm into the ear, with deeper penetration occurring as the kernels harden. Larvae do not eat the hard kernels, but take bites out of many kernels, lowering the quality of the corn for processing.|$|E
5|$|Section 2 {{gives the}} third party various protections <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> chosen {{to enforce the}} act - the parties cannot alter or end the {{contract}} if the third party has told them that he wishes to enforce the contract or relied on the contract (and the promisor knows this or {{could be expected to}} have known this). If the contract is breached, the third party has all the rights that he would have if he had been a party to the initial contract.|$|E
5|$|Testing of {{cosmetic}} products on animals is {{banned in the}} member states of the European Community, although France protested the ban and has made efforts to have it lifted. It is permitted in the United States but is not mandatory if safety can be ascertained by other methods, and the test species is not specified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). When testing toxicity of food additives, food contaminants, and some drugs and chemicals the FDA uses beagles and miniature pigs as surrogates for direct human testing. Minnesota was {{the first state to}} enact a Beagle freedom adoption law in 2014, mandating that dogs and cats are allowed to be adopted <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> completed with research testing.|$|E

5|$|The {{duration}} of parental care in frigatebirds {{is among the}} longest for birds, rivalled only by the southern ground hornbill and some large accipitrids. Frigatebirds take many years to reach sexual maturity. A study of great frigatebirds in the Galapagos Islands found that they only bred <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> acquired the full adult plumage. This was attained by female birds when they were eight to nine {{years of age and}} by male birds when they were ten to eleven years of age.|$|E
5|$|The player gains {{points by}} {{defeating}} multiple enemies consecutively and {{can participate in}} a bonus round to gain more points. Enemies are defeated by kicking them over <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been flipped on their back. This is accomplished by hitting the platform the enemy is on directly beneath them. If the player allows too much time to pass after doing this, the enemy will flip itself back over, changing in color and increasing speed. Each phase has {{a certain number of}} enemies, with the final enemy immediately changing color and increasing to maximum speed. Hitting a flipped enemy from underneath causes it to right itself and start moving again, but it does not change speed or color.|$|E
5|$|When Picard {{returns to}} the Enterprise, he discovers that {{survivors}} from the Borg sphere have invaded the ship and are beginning to assimilate both the Enterprise and its crew. <b>Once</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> assimilated the ship, the Borg plan {{to use it to}} attack and conquer Earth. Picard and a team attempt to reach engineering to disable the Borg with corrosive coolant used in the warp core. The assault fails and Data is captured; he meets the Queen of the Borg Collective, who attempts to turn him to her side. A frightened Sloane ambushes the captain, but he soon gains her trust and they escape the Borg-infested area of the ship by using the holodeck to create a weapon.|$|E

5|$|A unique {{feature of}} Murder on the Orient Express is Poirot, {{who serves as}} a hint system for the {{duration}} of the game. The player can access Poirot at any time during the game, and can receive hints to help them proceed. The game has two difficulty levels, and the player can determine which one they prefer to play at soon after the murder occurs. Poirot challenges the player, allowing them to choose to either readily accept help from him and allow him to guide the player through the game, or alternatively try to outsmart the famous sleuth by solving the mystery with obscure, and in some cases nonexistent hints. If the player has trouble <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> chosen the more difficult setting, Poirot will gradually become more forthcoming with information.|$|E
5|$|According to Larousse Gastronomique, the durian {{fruit is}} ready to eat when its husk begins to crack. However, the ideal stage of {{ripeness}} to be enjoyed varies from region to region in Southeast Asia and by species. Some species grow so tall that they can only be collected <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> fallen to the ground, whereas most cultivars of D. zibethinus are nearly always cut from the tree and allowed to ripen while waiting to be sold. Some people in southern Thailand prefer their durians relatively young when the clusters of fruit within the shell are still crisp in texture and mild in flavour. For some people in northern Thailand, the preference is for the fruit to be soft and aromatic. In Malaysia and Singapore, most consumers prefer the fruit to be as ripe and pungent in aroma as possible and may even risk allowing the fruit to continue ripening after its husk has already cracked open. In this state, the flesh becomes richly creamy, slightly alcoholic, the aroma pronounced and the flavour highly complex.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrate {{catabolism}} is {{the breakdown}} of carbohydrates into smaller units. Carbohydrates are usually taken into cells <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been digested into monosaccharides. Once inside, the major route of breakdown is glycolysis, where sugars such as glucose and fructose are converted into pyruvate and some ATP is generated. Pyruvate is an intermediate in several metabolic pathways, but the majority is converted to acetyl-CoA through aerobic (with oxygen) glycolysis and fed into the citric acid cycle. Although some more ATP is generated in the citric acid cycle, the most important product is NADH, which is made from NAD+ as the acetyl-CoA is oxidized. This oxidation releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In anaerobic conditions, glycolysis produces lactate, through the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase re-oxidizing NADH to NAD+ for re-use in glycolysis. An alternative route for glucose breakdown is the pentose phosphate pathway, which reduces the coenzyme NADPH and produces pentose sugars such as ribose, the sugar component of nucleic acids.|$|E

50|$|Some {{locomotives}} {{were also}} fitted with Giesl-Gieslingen suction draught systems, the so-called Giesl ejectors. However, for licensing reasons, these were removed <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> worn out or become defective.|$|R
5|$|Members of {{the current}} and {{previous}} Worldcon are eligible to nominate new writers for the Campbell Award under the same procedures as the Hugo Awards. Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, at which point a shortlist is made of the five most-nominated writers, with additional nominees possible {{in the case of}} ties. Voting on the ballot of five nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held. Writers become eligible <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a work published anywhere in the world which was sold for more than a nominal amount. While final decisions on eligibility are decided by the WSFS, the given criteria for an author to be eligible are specifically defined as someone who has had a written work in a publication which had more than 10,000 readers and which paid the writer at least 3 cents per word and a total of at least 50 US dollars.|$|E
5|$|The nymphs are {{eaten by}} {{a wide range of}} predators and form an {{important}} part of the aquatic food chain. Fish are among the main predators, picking nymphs off the bottom or ingesting them in the water column, and feeding on emerging nymphs and adults on the water surface. Carnivorous stonefly, caddisfly, alderfly and dragonfly larvae feed on bottom-dwelling mayfly nymphs, as do aquatic beetles, leeches, crayfish and amphibians. Besides the direct mortality caused by these predators, the behaviour of their potential prey is also affected, with the nymphs' growth rate being slowed by the need to hide rather than feed. The nymphs are highly susceptible to pollution and can be useful in the biomonitoring of water bodies. <b>Once</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> emerged, large numbers are preyed on by birds, bats and by other insects.|$|E
5|$|The second plot of {{the episode}} {{revolves}} around Jerry; when he prepares {{to go to the}} laundromat, Kramer asks him to take his laundry with him. Jerry agrees after some reluctance, insisting that their clothes remain segregated. After retrieving the laundry the following day and returning Kramer's portion, Jerry remembers that he had hidden a large sum of money in his laundry bag, but is unable to find it. The owner of the laundromat (John Capodice), tells him that he did not see the money, but also points out that he is not responsible for valuables. Kramer and Jerry both assume Vic stole the money and Kramer comes {{up with a plan to}} put cement mix in one of Vic's washing machines as revenge. <b>Once</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> acted out the plan, Kramer discovers that he had the money all along; and it turns out to be just enough to cover the damage to the washing machine.|$|E
50|$|In Lingshan Temple, teams climbed 88m (217 steps), where <b>they</b> <b>had</b> {{to count}} all the flower pots decorating the monument. <b>Once</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> {{the correct answer}} (1509), the monk would give them their next clue.|$|R
