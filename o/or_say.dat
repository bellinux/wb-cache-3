5|$|Jains {{believe that}} karma is a {{physical}} substance that is everywhere in the universe. Karma particles are attracted to the soul {{by the actions of}} that soul. Karma particles are attracted when we do, think, <b>or</b> <b>say</b> things, when we kill something, when we lie, when we steal and so on. Karma not only encompasses the causality of transmigration, but is also conceived of as an extremely subtle matter, which infiltrates the soul—obscuring its natural, transparent and pure qualities. Karma is thought of as a kind of pollution, that taints the soul with various colours (leśyā). Based on its karma, a soul undergoes transmigration and reincarnates in various states of existence—like heavens or hells, or as humans or animals.|$|E

25|$|In December 1991, the {{two governments}} were again in talks to extend the {{withdrawal}} of American forces for three years but this broke down as the United States refused to spell out in detail their withdrawal plans <b>or</b> <b>say</b> if nuclear weapons were kept on base; nuclear weapons were forbidden on Philippine soil. Finally, on December 27, President Corazon Aquino, who fought to delay the pullout to cushion the country's battered economy, issued a formal notice for the U.S. to leave {{what has been the}} U.S.'s largest overseas defense facility after Clark Air Base was closed, by the end of 1992.|$|E
25|$|Those {{who suffer}} from social anxiety {{disorder}} fear being judged by others in society. In particular, individuals with social anxiety are nervous {{in the presence of}} people with authority and feel uncomfortable during physical examinations. People {{who suffer from}} this disorder may behave a certain way <b>or</b> <b>say</b> something and then feel embarrassed or humiliated after. As a result, they often choose to isolate themselves from society to avoid such situations. They may also feel uncomfortable meeting people they do not know, and act distant when they are with large groups of people. In some cases, they may show evidence of this disorder by avoiding eye contact, or blushing when someone is talking to them.|$|E

25|$|The {{trials were}} held back to back, {{each with a}} {{separate}} jury of twelve white men. The prosecution, led by Irvin W. Cubine, introduced evidence showing that non-consensual sex took place. Some of the defendants acknowledged having sexual intercourse with Floyd, but {{said that it was}} consensual, or that she did not resist <b>or</b> <b>say</b> no, either considered necessary as a condition to prove rape. Virginia law authorized capital punishment for accessories, parties to the act of rape who did not take part in the act. On the stand, each of the defendants at least partially rejected his confession. In some cases, they said that the police had written the confessions, that the formal account varied from a handwritten version, and that they had not fully read the police version when signing and did not recognize that their own accounts had been changed.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive {{emotions}} and states {{tend to be}} felt {{in the initial stages}} of infidelity whenever the faithful partner is alone or left alone by the suspected unfaithful one. Cognitive {{emotions and}} responses are that of those in which an individual anticipates them (Miller, 2017). Jealousy may become cognitive whenever an individual begins to process what their partner is out doing or what they see in the person they are cheating with that they don’t see in them. Resentment and the feeling of incompetence take on the cognitive state in the initial stages when the individual begins to recognize and feel that nothing they do <b>or</b> <b>say</b> will be good enough or just enough to get the infidelity suspicious to cease. Anger takes on cognitive emotional traits whenever the accuser notices and realizes why they are feeling so angry and the accused is confronted with it. Like previously stated, the initial stages of cheating are when it cannot be proven by the suspicious partner. Once couples begin to anticipate the actions and emotions of their partners, even if evidence have not been set forth, the emotions of infidelity enter a cognitive state.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of Orthodox and some Conservative Jews reject {{the idea that}} a woman can publicly read from the Torah or lead prayer services whenever there is a minyan (quorum of 10 males) available to do so. However, the public celebration of a girl becoming bat mitzvah in other ways has made strong inroads into Modern Orthodox Judaism and also into some elements of Haredi Judaism. In these congregations, women do not read from the Torah or lead prayer services, but they occasionally lecture on a Jewish topic to mark their coming of age, learn a book of Tanakh, recite verses from the Book of Esther or the Book of Psalms, <b>or</b> <b>say</b> prayers from the siddur. In some Modern Orthodox circles, bat mitzvah girls will read from the Torah and lead prayer services in a women's tefillah. Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, a prominent Orthodox posek, has ruled that bat mitzvah celebrations are permissible, but should not be held in a synagogue, because then they would be construed as imitating Reform and Conservative customs; in any case, {{they do not have the}} status of seudat mitzvah. Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef holds that it is a seudat mitzvah.|$|E

500|$|When writing [...] "I Want to Tell You", Harrison drew {{inspiration}} from his experimentation with the hallucinogenic drug LSD. The lyrics address what he later termed [...] "the avalanche of thoughts that are so hard to write down <b>or</b> <b>say</b> or transmit". In combination with the song's philosophical message, Harrison's stuttering guitar riff and the dissonance he employs in the melody reflect the difficulties of achieving meaningful communication. The recording {{marked the first time}} that McCartney played his bass guitar part after the band had completed the rhythm track for a song, a technique that became common on the Beatles' subsequent recordings.|$|E

[...] She said, [...] "I always thought it was my fault; that I didn’t do <b>or</b> <b>say</b> the right thing. I know young girls who’ve been raped and didn’t even know it was rape. They think, ‘It must have been because I said ‘no’ the wrong way.’" ...|$|E

Lennon liked to oblige, with autographs or pictures, any fans who had been waiting {{for long periods of time}} to meet him, and once said during a 6 December 1980 interview with BBC Radio's Andy Peebles: [...] "People come and ask for autographs, <b>or</b> <b>say</b> 'Hi', but they don't bug you."

Foote said, [...] "The scheme was deliberately put in place to avoid the VA's own internal rules". He said that workers at the Phoenix VA were intimidated into complying with the deception. [...] "They have families, they have mortgages and if they speak out <b>or</b> <b>say</b> anything to anybody about it, they will be fired and they know that." ...|$|E
500|$|In his autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison {{says that}} [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] {{addresses}} [...] "the avalanche of thoughts {{that are so}} hard to write down <b>or</b> <b>say</b> or transmit". Authors Russell Reising and Jim LeBlanc cite the song, along with [...] "Rain" [...] and [...] "Within You Without You", as an early example of the Beatles abandoning [...] "coy" [...] statements in their lyrics and instead [...] "adopt an urgent tone, intent on channeling some essential knowledge, the psychological and/or philosophical epiphanies of LSD experience" [...] to their listeners. Writing in The Beatles Anthology, Harrison likened the outlook inspired by his taking the drug to that of [...] "an astronaut on the moon, or in his spaceship, {{looking back at the}} Earth.

Hess felt the depiction {{had a more}} natural look, Rockwell objected, [...] "It was too diverse, it went every which way and didn't settle anywhere <b>or</b> <b>say</b> anything." [...] He felt the upward view from the bench level was more dramatic. Rockwell explained to Yates at The Post {{that he had to}} start Freedom of Speech from scratch after an early attempt because he had overworked it. Twice he almost completed the work only to feel it was lacking. Eventually, he was able to produce the final version with the speaker as the subject rather than the assembly. For the accompanying essay, Post editor Ben Hibbs chose novelist and dramatist Tarkington who was a Pulitzer Prize winner. People who purchased war bonds during the Second War Bond Drive received a full-color set of reproductions of the Four Freedoms that had a commemorative cover with Freedom of Speech on it.|$|E

500|$|Critics who {{disliked the}} album cited what they {{viewed as a}} ridiculous concept. Salon remarked in its review that [...] "Musically [...] their 1995 album Clouds Taste Metallic offers the same {{psychotic}} results without all the technological hassle. And conceptually? The same thing, just all at once: stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid." [...] Jason Josephes from Pitchfork awarded the album a score of 0.0 out of 10; in a scathing review, Josephes criticized the album for being inaccessible, asking [...] "Do I want to buy three more CD players with which to enjoy Zaireeka <b>or,</b> <b>say,</b> eat?" [...] and derided the band's fans. Further, in October 2009, editor-in-chief of Pitchfork, Mark Richardson, wrote a book titled Zaireeka for the 33 1/3 book series, published by Continuum International Publishing, now owned by Bloomsbury Publishing. In it, Richardson chronicles {{the creation of the}} album, praises it from multiple angles, and discusses the impact the album has had on music since its release. The album was included in Pitchforks 2010 list of [...] "ten unusual CD-era gimmicks".|$|E
500|$|In 2009, she {{appeared}} in the comedy film Extract with Ben Affleck and Jason Bateman. The film received mostly positive reviews, and grossed $10.8 million at the box office. Roger Ebert, while critical of the film itself, wrote that Kunis [...] "brings her role to within shouting distance of credibility." [...] Director Mike Judge commented {{that part of what}} was surprising to learn about Kunis was her ability to make references to the cult animation film Rejected. Judge said: [...] "As beautiful as Mila is, you could believe that maybe she would cross paths with you in the real world." [...] After seeing Kunis perform in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Judge wanted to cast her in the role of Cindy in Extract: [...] "I just thought, 'Wow, this girl's perfect.' And she really wanted to do it, which was fantastic." [...] Kunis herself stated that [...] "I'm a huge fan of Mike Judge's from Office Space, so I was, like, 'Okay, this is a very easy decision.' I told them I would do anything needed to be in this production– like craft service, <b>or,</b> <b>say,</b> acting." ...|$|E
500|$|Lansbury was {{defensive}} about Jessica Fletcher, having creative input over the character's costumes, makeup and hair, and rejecting pressure from network executives {{to put her}} in a relationship, believing that the character should remain a strong single female. When she believed that a scriptwriter had made Jessica do <b>or</b> <b>say</b> things that did not fit with the character's personality, Lansbury ensured that the script was changed. She saw Jessica as a role model for older female viewers, praising her [...] "enormous, universal appeal – that was an accomplishment I never expected in my entire life." [...] Lansbury biographers Rob Edelman and Audrey E. Kupferberg described the series as [...] "a television landmark" [...] in the U.S. for having an older female character as the protagonist, thereby paving the way for later series like The Golden Girls. Lansbury herself noted that [...] "I think it's the first time a show has really been aimed at the middle aged audience", and although it was most popular among senior citizens, it gradually gained a younger audience; by 1991, a third of viewers were under fifty. It gained continually high ratings throughout most of its run, outdoing rivals in its time slot such as Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories on NBC. In February 1987, a spin-off was produced, The Law & Harry McGraw, although it was short-lived.|$|E
