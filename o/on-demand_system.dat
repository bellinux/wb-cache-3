[...] Using different research methods to Kilgour and Matas, Ethan Gutmann, adjunct fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, found that his estimate of the number of Falun Gong practitioners killed for organs of approximately 65,000 was close to the estimate of 62,250 by Kilgour and Matas.

In this paper we focus on <b>on-demand</b> broadcast <b>system.</b> We propose a new ondemand scheduling algorithm that takes scheduling decision at periodic interval, unlike previous algorithms that take decision after broadcasting every data item. This reduces the time client spends monitoring the broadcast channel for data items.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present two {{techniques}} {{to improve the}} capacity of video on demand sysrems. Video on demand is an elecrronic video rental system in which clients requesr and play videos on-demand. Video on demand system can be implemented over an existing cable TV network or an upgraded ADSL network. The two techniques used to improve rhe capacity of video <b>on-demand</b> <b>systems</b> are segmentation and multicasring. Segmentation consists of dividing the video into several fired length segments. and then transmitting rhe segments at regular intervals instead of transmitting the entire video continuously. Mulricasring assumes that each subscriber has a limited storage space, so same video segments can be multicast fo subscribers simultaneously. Results of a comprehensive simulation srudy presented in the paper show a significant improvement in the capacity of rhe system when these two techniques are applied. In evaluating video <b>on-demand</b> <b>systems</b> we considered the following parameters: rhe number of users supported, the number of videos played per day, {{and the number of}} requests rejected per day. 1...|$|R

It also allows for random access within these recordings. The system include a Web-interface for starting and controlling running sessions. To compensate for jitter and out-of-order packets, sessions distributed in RTP-format (RFC 1889), can be reconstructed with new time-stamps. During playback, the data can also be transformed in various ways to follow the users requests. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{prefetching}} strategies in a peerdriven video <b>on-demand</b> <b>system.</b> In our design, each video is encoded into multiple low bit-rate substreams and copies of the substreams are distributed to the participating peers. When a peer streams in a substream of rate r, it instead streams at rate ˆr where ˆr> r. In this manner, {{if one of the}} peer’s suppliers disconnects, the client peer can tap the reservoir of prefetched bits while searching for a replacement server, thereby avoiding any glitches or reduced visual quality. We examine how to assign prefetching rates to each of substreams as a function of their importance. Our studies show that appropriate prefetching strategies can bring significant performance improvements for both multiple description and layered videos. 1...|$|E

40|$|SIMIS (the FAO Scheme Irrigation Management Information System) is a {{decision}} support system that integrates tools and performance indicators to facilitate the planning and management of irrigation schemes. The authors used SIMIS to compute performance indicators in an irrigation scheme in Southern Spain {{that were used to}} identify distribution system constraints affecting the flexibility of water deliveries and to identify scheme sectors where deliveries could not meet the predicted crop water demands. Applying SIMIS, the authors and the irrigation scheme manager evaluated measures to overcome the constraints for future irrigation campaigns, and to refine the water orders made every 2 weeks to the basin authority. On the other hand, SIMIS presented limitations to the evaluation of on-demand delivery schedules. To overcome these limitations, an external model, developed outside SIMIS, showed that the current distribution network of the scheme has the capacity to deliver water on-demand only if a slight water deficit is accepted during the peak demand period. The analysis showed that by relaxing the stringency of the quality of operation of <b>on-demand</b> <b>systems,</b> rotation systems may be transformed into <b>on-demand</b> <b>systems</b> without changing their structures. This analysis could also be done using Clément's hypothesis, but doing so resulted in overestimates of the quality of operation and of the relative irrigation supply. ...|$|R
