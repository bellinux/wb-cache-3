Because <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> hurricane, Spielberg was unable to shoot a fight at a waterfall, so he sent the second unit to film shots of Brazil's and Argentina's Iguazu Falls. These were digitally combined into the fight, which was shot at the Universal backlot.|$|E

5|$|Dust {{kicked up}} by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the {{darkness}} of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only weather radar observations, or possibly the sound <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> tornado, serve as any warning {{to those in the}} storm's path. Most significant tornadoes form under the storm's updraft base, which is rain-free, making them visible. Also, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. Night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.|$|E
5|$|Further, young giraffes {{are much}} more {{vulnerable}} to predation than adults: between 60% and 75% of calves die within a year. Mothers hide their calves, which spend {{much of the time}} lying down in cover. Since the presence of a mother does not affect survival, Mitchell suggests that young giraffes must be extremely well camouflaged. This is supported by the fact that coat markings are strongly inherited. Conversely, far from hiding, adult giraffes move about to gain the best view <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> predator, relying on their size and ability to defend themselves even from lions.|$|E

Thorin is fatally wounded and reconciles with Bilbo before he dies. Bilbo accepts {{only a small portion}} of his share of the treasure, having no want or need for more, but still returns home a very wealthy hobbit.|$|E

5|$|Hermes was berthed in Trincomalee on 8 April when {{a warning}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> Japanese fleet was received, and she sailed that {{day for the}} Maldives with no {{aircraft}} on board. On 9 April a Japanese scout plane spotted her near Batticaloa, and she was attacked by several dozen dive bombers shortly afterwards.

5|$|Storms that {{approach}} the southwestern United States, {{and by extension}} Arizona, generally form closer to the Mexican shoreline than average, making them more likely to recurve northwards under the influence <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> trough. These troughs tend to extend farther to the south during {{the latter part of}} the Pacific hurricane season, in the period between late August and early October. These pronounced troughs thus produce a synoptic-scale flow that is conducive to steering hurricanes towards the southwestern United States.|$|E
5|$|Submarine {{films like}} Robert Wise's 1958 Run Silent, Run Deep {{constitute}} a distinctive subgenre {{of the war}} film, depicting the stress of submarine warfare. The genre makes distinctive use of the soundtrack, which attempts to bring home the emotional and dramatic nature of conflict under the sea. For example, in the 1981 Das Boot, the sound design works together with the hours-long film format to depict lengthy pursuit with depth charges and the many times repeated ping of sonar, {{as well as the}} threatening sounds of a destroyer's propellor and <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> torpedo.|$|E

5|$|Surge can be {{measured}} directly at coastal tidal stations as {{the difference between the}} forecast tide and the observed rise of water. Another method of measuring surge is by the deployment of pressure transducers along the coastline just ahead <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> tropical cyclone. This was first tested for Hurricane Rita in 2005. These types of sensors can be placed in locations that will be submerged and can accurately measure the height of water above them.|$|E
5|$|The King Charles is a {{friendly}} breed, {{to the extent}} that it is not typically as suitable as a watchdog as some breeds, though it may still bark to warn its owners <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> visitor. It is not a high energy breed, and enjoys the company of family members, being primarily a lapdog. Although able to bond well with children and tolerant of them, it will not accept rough handling. It prefers not to be left alone for long periods. Known as one of the quietest toy breeds, it is suitable for apartment living.|$|E
5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} formed at the tail-end of a stationary front, organizing into a tropical depression by 18:00UTC on October28 about 520mi (835km) south-southeast of Bermuda. Steered west-northwest and then sharply northeast ahead <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> cold front, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Shary six hours after formation. Within {{an environment of}} low wind shear, Shary strengthened into a hurricane and attained peak winds of 75mph (120km/h) by 00:00UTC on October30 as an eye became apparent on microwave imagery. The storm became increasingly asymmetric as it interacted with the front, and Shary transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by 18:00UTC that day. The extratropical system was completely absorbed by the front six hours later. Since Shary remained south and east of Bermuda, its effects were limited to 0.54in (13.7mm) of rainfall and a gust to 35mph (56km/h).|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{effectiveness}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> transradial <b>approach</b> for percutaneous coronary inter-vention (PCI) {{is comparable}} to that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> transfemoral <b>approach.</b> However, few studies have systematically compared the clinical effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tran-sradial <b>approach</b> with that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> transfemoral <b>approach</b> for unprotected left main coronary artery (ULMCA) stenoses. We compared success rate, vascu-lar complications and early (in-hospital and six-month) outcomes of transra-dial PCI for ULMCA stenoses with those <b>of</b> <b>a</b> transfemoral <b>approach.</b> Methods: This retrospective study included 131 patients undergoing PCI for ULMCA stenoses between December 2000 and October 2006 : 116 (88. 5 %) patients underwent <b>a</b> transradial <b>approach</b> and fifteen (11. 5 %) underwent <b>a</b> trans-femoral <b>approach.</b> Results: Both angiographic and procedural success were achieved in 114 (98. 3 %) patients in the transradial group and fourteen (93. 3 %) patients in the trans-femoral group (p = 0. 876). Patients in the transfemoral group required more debulking procedures with large guiding catheters and had larger minima...|$|R
5|$|A large upper-level low {{separated}} from a trough north of Puerto Rico in early July. Convection increased on July7 after a surface trough developed, {{and a low}} pressure area formed east of the Bahamas once the upper-level low retreated to the southwest. Wind shear decreased across the region, allowing the convection to increase and organize, and it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression on July11 about 330miles (530km) southwest of Bermuda. After developing, the cyclone moved northeastward in advance <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> cold front. It quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Bill, and briefly threatened to pass near Bermuda. As a result, a tropical storm warning was issued, although it was quickly dropped; there was {{no impact on the}} island from Bill.|$|E
5|$|Beryl {{maintained}} peak winds {{for about}} 18hours as it paralleled the Mid-Atlantic and New Jersey coasts, during which an eye-like feature {{developed in the}} center of the convection. Late on July 20, it began a slow weakening trend after passing over cooler waters. Steering winds ahead <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> mid-level trough caused Beryl to accelerate northeastward, and early on July 21 the center of the storm crossed the island of Nantucket. The convection diminished as it moved through progressively colder waters, and shortly after 1200UTC on July 21 Beryl became an extratropical cyclone a short distance east of Cape Cod. Hours later, it made landfall in southwestern Nova Scotia, and on July 22 the extratropical remnants of Beryl merged with an approaching cold front over Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|By {{early on}} October 9, the {{depression}} {{consisted of a}} circulation center {{without any of the}} associated deep convection {{that is one of the}} prerequisites of being a tropical cyclone. Several hurricane forecast models predicted Kyle to weaken until dissipation. After 24hours without significant convection, thunderstorms reformed to the southeast of the center on October 10 as the depression entered an area of warmer water temperatures. Environmental conditions became more favorable, with weakening wind shear and decreasing dry air. The depression continued tracking around a ridge, turning to the west and west-northwest toward the coast of Florida. Convection increased markedly early on October 11 as it turned northward ahead <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> cold front, and Kyle regained tropical storm status about 35miles (60km) east of the border between Florida and Georgia.|$|E

5|$|Due to fears <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> Ottoman army, Skanderbeg first {{sent his}} nephew, Constantine, with 500 cavalry to Barletta. They were {{incorporated}} into Ferdinand's forces to combat his Angevin rivals. They held back their enemy for a year, but did not gain much ground until Skanderbeg arrived in September 1461. Before reaching Italy, Skanderbeg visited Ragusa (Dubrovnik) to convince its rectors to help fund his campaign. Meanwhile, his men landed in Italy and Angevin forces lifted their siege on Barletta. Upon arriving, Skanderbeg continued to pursue his ally's enemies with great success. Ferdinand's adversaries thus began to retreat from his territories and Skanderbeg went back to Albania; a troop of his men stayed until Ferdinand managed to finally defeat the pretenders to his throne at the Battle of Orsara, {{although it is not}} known if Skanderbeg's men participated.|$|E
5|$|Random, {{isolated}} cirrus do {{not have}} any particular significance. A large number of cirrus clouds can be a sign <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> frontal system or upper air disturbance. This signals a change in weather in the near future, which usually becomes stormier. If the cloud is a cirrus castellanus, there might be instability at the high altitude level. When the clouds deepen and spread, especially when they are of the cirrus radiatus variety or cirrus fibratus species, this usually indicates an approaching weather front. If it is a warm front, the cirrus clouds spread out into cirrostratus, which then thicken and lower into altocumulus and altostratus. The next set of clouds are the rain-bearing nimbostratus clouds. When cirrus clouds precede a cold front, squall line or multicellular thunderstorm, it is because they are blown off the anvil, and the next to arrive are the cumulonimbus clouds. Kelvin-Helmholtz waves indicate extreme wind shear at high levels.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after {{reaching}} its peak intensity, Debby encountered {{an area of}} dry air, and subsequently weakened. The low level circulation detached itself from the diminishing convection while {{the system as a}} whole continued west-northwestward. Convection redeveloped over a portion of the center, while banding features redeveloped as well. Organization continued, and Debby again reached its peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) on August 24. Southerly wind shear displaced the convection {{to the north of the}} center, and Debby weakened to a minimal tropical storm on August 25. The center of the storm became asymmetric and elongated, and on August 26 Debby weakened to a tropical depression. Convection remained minimal and it quickly degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure. The low turned to the north and north-northeast ahead <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> trough, and on August 28 the low dissipated.|$|E
