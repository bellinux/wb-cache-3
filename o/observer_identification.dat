40|$|Several recent {{developments}} raise {{concern about the}} quality and consistency of racial statistics produced by government surveys. • In 1997, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) introduced significant changes in official racial classifications, the most important being to allow respondents to report one or more races. • Immigration (particularly of people from Central and South America) {{over the past three}} decades has greatly increased the fraction of population which does not report in any of the major OMB race categories. • Many surveys are collected by multiple modes, and it has proven difficult to adapt the question on race to produce comparable data in different modes. • Survey differences in race data appear to be due to question wording and mode differences, and possibly interviewer effects. We discuss several methodological problems affecting race measurement, including wording and conceptual issues, mode effects, and interviewer effects. Drawing on evidence from qualitative and quantitative research, we comment on wording differences between alternative questions on race. Finally, we suggest research needed to address measurement problems. 1 RACE AS A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT OMB has established the general principle that “selfidentification is the preferred means of obtaining information about an individual's race and ethnicity, except in instances where <b>observer</b> <b>identification</b> is more practical (e. g., completing a death certificate) ” (OMB, 1997 : 58785).

Misidentifications could compromise observer data particularly in diverse, multi-species fisheries {{such as those in}} the tropics where visual identificati on is challenging. Here, we provide the first estimates of the ability of scientific observers to identify five species of morphologically similar carcharhinid sharks (Carcharhinus leucas, C. amboinensis, C. tilstoni, C. sorrah and C. brevipinna) in a fishery in northern Australia. We compared <b>observer</b> field <b>identifications</b> of sharks with genetic validation (814. bp mtDNA NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4) to quantify species identification errors. We used binomial generalised linear models to determine the influences of species, gender, total length, and the <b>observer's</b> experience on <b>identification</b> error. We found that identification error (∼ 20 %) depended predominately on the species in question (highest error for C. tilstoni). Male sharks were misidentified less frequently than females, and error decreased marginally with increasing total length.

Our results provide the first benchmark of <b>identification</b> accuracy of <b>observers</b> for carcharhinid sharks in northern Australia and show that estimates of error in species identifications need to be incorporated into management strategies to ensure successful recovery of the many recently over-fished shark populations. 7 page(s...|$|R

Preprocessing consisted of 3 D reconstruction with Maxilim software and STL file repair with Netfabb software. Then, the data were used to print 2 plastic replicas with a low-cost 3 D fused deposition modeling printer (Up plus 2 ®). Two independent <b>observers</b> performed the <b>identification</b> of 26 anatomic landmarks on the 4 mandibles (2 dry and 2 replicas) with a 3 D measuring arm. Each <b>observer</b> repeated the <b>identifications</b> 20 times. The comparison between the dry and plastic mandibles was based on 13 distances: 8 distances less than 12 mm and 5 distances greater than 12 mm.

40|$|One {{difficulty}} in using Kalman filters {{in real world}} situations is {{the selection of the}} correct process noise, measurement noise, and initial state estimate and covariance. These parameters are commonly referred to as tuning parameters. Multiple methods have been developed to estimate these parameters. Most of those methods such as maximum likelihood, subspace, and <b>observer</b> Kalman <b>Identification</b> require extensive offline processing and are not suitable for real time processing. One technique, which is suitable for real time processing, is the residual tuning method.

The residual tuning technique uses this information to estimate corrections to those tuning parameters. The actual implementation results in a set of sequential equations that run in parallel with the Kalman filter. A. H.
