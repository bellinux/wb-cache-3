The factories of Susa, Gundeshapur, and Shushtar were famously known for their production of silk, and rivaled the Chinese factories. The Sasanians showed great toleration to {{the inhabitants of the}} countryside, which was important to create a great deal <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>in</b> case of famine.|$|E
500|$|From {{the late}} 1980s, R.E.M. was {{involved}} in the local politics of its hometown of Athens, Georgia. Buck explained to Sounds in 1987, [...] "Michael always says think local and act local—we have been doing a lot <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>in</b> our town to try and make it a better place." [...] The band often donated funds to local charities and to help renovate and preserve historic buildings in the town. R.E.M.'s political clout was credited with the narrow election of Athens mayor Gwen O'Looney twice in the 1990s.|$|E
500|$|Neutral monism, in philosophy, is the meta{{physical}} {{view that the}} mental and the physical are two ways of organizing or describing the same elements, which are themselves [...] "neutral", that is, neither physical nor mental. [...] This view denies that the mental and the physical are two fundamentally different things. Rather, neutral monism claims the universe consists of only one kind <b>of</b> <b>stuff,</b> <b>in</b> the form of neutral elements that are in themselves neither mental nor physical. These neutral elements might have the properties of color and shape, just as we experience those properties. But these shaped and colored elements do not exist in a mind (considered as a substantial entity, whether dualistically or physicalistically); they exist on their own.|$|E

500|$|The film {{is set in}} 2014. Josh Brolin {{provides}} the voice and performance capture for Thanos, the supervillain who appeared in The Avengers mid-credits scene. Gunn noted that the film would be connected to [...] Several other objects of significance appear in the Collector's museum, including a Chitauri from The Avengers and a Dark Elf from Thor: The Dark World, among other characters. About their appearances Gunn said, [...] "There's a lot <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>in</b> the Collector's Museum. And for me, it was mostly just really fun. As a Marvel fan, giving the actual fans something that they can freeze frame on their Blu-Ray at home {{and just kind of}} pick out everything that's in there. So there are, I mean, seriously all those boxes have something interesting in them, so it's pretty fun."

500|$|The {{speed and}} {{facility}} with which Dylan wrote topical songs {{attracted the attention}} of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on WBAI in June 1962, Pete Seeger described Dylan as [...] "the most prolific songwriter on the scene" [...] and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently. Dylan replied, [...] "I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> <b>In</b> fact, I wrote five songs last night but I gave all the papers away in some place called the Bitter End." [...] Dylan also expressed the impersonal idea that the songs were not his own creation. In an interview with Sing Out! magazine, Dylan said, [...] "The songs are there. They exist all by themselves just waiting for someone to write them down. I just put them down on paper. If I didn't do it, somebody else would." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{adapting}} the film, a few adjustments were made, such as changing {{the names of}} the protagonists to Owen and Abby, and moving the setting from the Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg to [...] "a small New Mexico town." [...] Reeves was also asked to change the ages of the main characters, but he refused, saying that [...] "would ruin the essence of the story and change everything completely…we need that childlike innocence." [...] He also told his actors to not watch the original film beforehand so [...] "we could make our own version but stay very true to the essence of the story." [...] The filmmakers have noted that [...] "they intend to forge a unique identity for Let Me In, placing it firmly in an American context", {{while at the same time}} paying respect to the original. In comparing his adaptation to the Swedish one, Reeves admitted to not adding many different details from the book that weren't in the original film, stating that [...] "the story was so big that you couldn't really add a lot <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>in</b> without taking away the focus of the coming of age story so I tried to have allusions and references to stuff in the book." [...] Reeves also admitted to borrowing elements from the Swedish film, stating [...] "There are things that [...] adapted brilliantly in the movie and I borrowed from that because I thought he did a great adaptation. But there are some things that hopefully don't detract and fit into the context of the story. It's a mixture of details from the book, the original film and things that grew out of adapting it." [...] In {{adapting the}} story for American audiences, Reeves stated that keeping the 1980s time period within the film was critical in exploring the theme of good and evil. He used Ronald Reagan's [...] "evil empire speech" [...] as an example of American thought during that period. Reeves stated, [...] "The idea of Reagan's 'evil empire' speech and that whole sort of school of thought was that evil was something that was outside of us. Evil was 'Other,' it was over there, it was the Soviets". Reeves felt that this idea was central to the main character Owen, as he [...] "would be grappling with these very, very dark feelings but being in a kind of American town where there was that sort of [...] mindset and religiousness. How would you fit in? How would you feel about yourself being confused and being 12 or 13 years old and not knowing what it means that you wish you could kill those kids who were terrorizing you every day? The humanity of that." ...|$|E

2500|$|The R-1 won the 1932 Thompson Trophy [...] race, piloted by Jimmy Doolittle. [...] He {{also set}} a new world landplane speed record of 476km/h (296mph) in the Shell Speed Dash. The {{distinction}} of a landplane record was noteworthy because, at that time, specialized speed seaplanes outran landplanes, e.g. the Macchi M.C.72 with over 700km/h. The Springfield Union of September 6, 1932 quoted Doolittle as saying, [...] "She is the sweetest ship I've ever flown. She is perfect in every respect and the motor is {{just as good as}} it was a week ago. It never missed a beat and has lots <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>in</b> it yet.

5000|$|In “The Meaning of Meaning” (1975), Putnam {{had argued}} that {{the meaning of a}} natural kind term such as “water” depends {{on the nature of the}} {{physical}} world.

St. Paul Church Of God In Christ was and still is my home church". Furthermore, she explained, [...] "I sang my first solo at the age of seven. I directed the choir, I was an usher. I was a straight-up church girl. I did a lot <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>in</b> the community such as singing in various choirs and at my school." [...] In discussing the musical transition she said, [...] "it wasn't a hard transition at all. This is something that has been in my heart to do, so I had to do it. I thought {{that it would be a}} perfect time. Choosing to do this at the height of my career rather than doing it when Destiny's Child is at a downfall, you know? Most people do that.
