5|$|The Circles of Sustainability {{assessment}} of Delhi gives a marginally more favourable {{impression of the}} ecological sustainability of the city only because {{it is based on}} a more comprehensive series of measures than only air pollution. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> that the city remains assessed at basic sustainability is because of the low resource-use and carbon emissions of its poorer neighbourhoods.|$|E

5|$|After the Second World War, {{there was}} a large {{increase}} in the number of gangs in Sophiatown. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for this was that there were about 20000 African teenagers in the city who were not at school and did not have jobs. Township youths were unable to find jobs easily. Employers were reluctant to employ teenagers as they did not have any work experience, and many of them were not able to read or write. They also considered them to be undisciplined and weak.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, 57% {{of women}} of childbearing age want to avoid {{pregnancy}} (867 of 1520million). About 222 million women however were not able to access birth control, 53million of whom were in sub-Saharan Africa and 97million of whom were in Asia. This results in 54million unplanned pregnancies and nearly 80,000 maternal deaths a year. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> that many women are without birth control is that many countries limit access due to religious or political reasons, while another contributor is poverty. Due to restrictive abortion laws in Sub-Saharan Africa, many women turn to unlicensed abortion providers for unintended pregnancy, resulting in about 2–4% obtaining unsafe abortions each year.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, he posted career highs in ERA (2.89), {{opponent}} {{batting average}} (.211) and WHIP (1.03). He was 13–7 in 30 games and {{was selected to}} his third All-Star Game. At {{the end of the}} 2011 season, the Red Sox stumbled and failed to make the playoffs. Beckett and two more starting pitchers (John Lackey and Jon Lester) were {{in the center of a}} controversy where the three drank alcohol during games, where they weren't pitching, and also ate fried chicken and played video games. Beckett was noted as the leader of this and some cited this behavior as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for the team's poor play down the stretch.|$|E

Zhou proposed a gradual move towards increased use of IMF special drawing rights (SDRs).|$|E
5|$|Parallel to NDRE's work, NTNF {{was working}} with ESRO to gain support for a {{telemetry}} station. There was a degree of urgency as ESRO wanted the facility completed by 1967 {{in time for the}} launch of the spacecraft ESRO-2. NTNF and ESRO were also working on the establishment of Kongsfjord Telemetry Station in Ny-Ålesund. The agreement to build the station was approved by the Parliament of Norway in mid 1966. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for the Norwegian support was the opportunity of training Norwegians in pulse-code modulation and digital computing. For NDRE the station was a chance to apply its latest minicomputer, the Simulation for Automatic Machinery (SAM).|$|E
5|$|Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for Somerset's poor {{performances}} {{was their}} inability to consistently field their best players; at least four of their better cricketers were unable to commit to the full fixture list, and in all the county played 30 different people in their eight matches. Faint praise was offered to the batting of William Herbert Fowler, Newton and Edward Sainsbury in The Sportsman, but the bowling was considered by Wisden to be sub-standard, particularly that of Arnold Fothergill.|$|E

Another offshoot of this local funding is that Phoenix is the largest city in the United States to have two Interstate Highways but no three-digit interstates.|$|E
5|$|The {{lineup of}} the live band had a {{tendency}} to change drastically between major tours: aside from Reznor remaining on lead vocals, keyboards and guitar, no member of the live band had remained constant since its inception.

5|$|The {{remaining}} 18 N-3PBs {{were used}} to equip No. 330 (Norwegian) Squadron RAF in Reykjavík, Iceland. The N-3PBs sent to Iceland were all shipped across the Atlantic in crates on board the Norwegian steamer , the voyage from New York to Reykjavik taking 13 days to complete. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for deploying the N-3PBs to Iceland were to avoid having the unusual aircraft operating over the United Kingdom, with the involved risk of friendly fire incidents. The exiled Norwegian military authorities had originally wanted to base the squadron in the United Kingdom {{in order to be}} able to operate off German-occupied Norway.|$|E

5|$|Work {{began in}} 1882 on Fort Glanville's {{northern}} sister Fort Largs—then {{known as the}} Port Adelaide battery—to the same specification as Fort Glanville; its barracks and rear defence wall were finished in 1885. Though guns had already been purchased specially, plans for the third fort at Glenelg were not proceeded with. South Australia was experiencing a depression in 1886 and that coupled with a report by General James Bevan Edwards scuttled plans for the third coastal fort. As early as 1888 the emphasis for defence of the Adelaide coast had already shifted to Fort Largs; a fact cited as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for abandonment of the Glenelg fortifications.|$|E
5|$|Alexander, who {{was also}} a highly {{regarded}} football player, did not play organized basketball until eighth grade. Alexander played on Curie's 2010–11 varsity team as a freshman, but had little impact at first and sat out some games in December. He missed the first ten games due to a heart murmur. In late December, he started getting local attention as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> Curie remained undefeated. During the Chicago Public High School League (CPL) and Illinois High School Association (IHSA) playoffs, he contributed significant performances. On March 9, 2011, Curie was eliminated from the IHSA playoffs in a Class 4A sectional semifinal by Lyons Township High School as freshman Alexander posted 9 points, 13 rebounds, and 2 blocks in a 66–64 loss. His late-season contributions gave Curie an added dimension, as the team finished with a 28–3 record. Following his freshman season, Alexander began to be recognized by local evaluators as a potential top national recruit. After Jabari Parker and Jahlil Okafor, Alexander was already considered the best Chicago area basketball prospect. He earned Red-Central all-conference recognition.|$|E
5|$|At age 18, {{playing in}} a limited role for HV71 during the 2010–11 season, Fast scored 16 points (seven goals, nine assists) in 36 games, with a +6 plus-minus, six penalty minutes and two power play goals, {{exceeded}} most observers' expectations. Fast credited playing alongside Johan Davidsson as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for his success and growth in confidence. He was held scoreless with a -3 plus-minute in three postseason games as the first-place HV71 was swept from {{the first round of}} the playoffs by Allmänna Idrottsklubben (AIK) in an upset. In the 2011–12 season, Fast had three multi-point games, including a career-high four assists and five points against AIK on October 4. That game started a streak of 10 points (one goal, nine assists) over six games, which continued to an October 20 match against Frölunda HC. However, Fast's season was cut short after he suffered a fractured ankle during a November 29 game against Brynäs IF. He missed three months as a result, but nevertheless recorded 16 points (five goals, 11 assists) in 21 games for the season, matching his Swedish Hockey League career high in points and establishing new career highs in assists and plus-minus (+9). He also scored two goals and one assist in five postseason games.|$|E
