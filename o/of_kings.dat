It shared many gameplay elements with The Age <b>of</b> <b>Kings</b> and was considered a spin-off of the main Age of Empires series.|$|E

5|$|A portal {{is created}} at Cloud Ruler Temple and the player is sent through to Mankar Camoran's created realm of Paradise. After {{bypassing}} Daedra, Mythic Dawn members and obstacles, the player confronts Camoran and kills him. The player returns the Amulet <b>of</b> <b>Kings</b> to Martin, and they subsequently {{travel to the}} Imperial City with the Blades to relight the Dragonfires and end the Daedric invasion. They find the city under attack by Daedra and an enormous avatar of Mehrunes Dagon himself. The player and Martin fight {{their way to the}} Temple of the One. There, Martin laments that they are powerless against Dagon's avatar and explains that they can only defeat him one way. He bids farewell to the player and shatters the Amulet <b>of</b> <b>Kings,</b> merging himself with the spirit of Akatosh, the Dragon-God of Time, thus becoming Akatosh's avatar. After a battle, Akatosh casts Dagon back into Oblivion and lets out a mighty roar before turning to stone. Martin, whose soul was consumed by the amulet, enters the afterlife to join his forebears. In a telepathic monologue to the player, he sheds an optimistic light, explaining that while the Amulet <b>of</b> <b>Kings</b> is destroyed and the throne again lies empty, the gates of Oblivion are now shut forever and the future of Tamriel now lies in the player's hands. The Empire's high chancellor sincerely thanks the player for their service during the crisis and proclaims them as the seventh Champion of Cyrodiil.|$|E
5|$|After A Game of Thrones, A Clash <b>of</b> <b>Kings,</b> and A Storm of Swords, Martin {{originally}} intended to write three more books. The fourth book, tentatively titled A Dance with Dragons, was to focus on Daenerys Targaryen's return to Westeros and the associated conflicts. Martin wanted to set this story five years after A Storm of Swords so that the younger characters could grow older and the dragons grow larger. Agreeing with his publishers early on that the new book should be shorter than A Storm of Swords, Martin set out to write the novel closer in length to A Clash <b>of</b> <b>Kings.</b> A long prologue was to establish {{what had happened in}} the meantime, initially just as one chapter of Aeron Damphair on the Iron Islands at the Kingsmoot. Since the events on the Iron Islands were to have an impact in the book and could not be told with existing POV characters, Martin eventually introduced three new viewpoints.|$|E

5|$|Compared to {{neighbouring}} Ireland and Anglo-Saxon England, few {{records of}} 9th- and 10th-century events in Scotland survive.

The list survives in the Poppleton Manuscript, a 13th-century compilation.
