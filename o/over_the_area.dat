5|$|Trigeminal {{neuralgia}} occurs {{later in}} life, from middle age onwards, most often after age 60, {{and is a}} condition typically associated with very strong pain distributed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> innervated by the maxillary or mandibular nerve divisions of the trigeminal nerve (V2 and V3).|$|E
5|$|At dawn on September 5 the North Koreans attacked. The {{engineers}} repulsed {{this attack}} but suffered some casualties. Ammunition was running low and three US C-47 Skytrain aircraft came <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> {{to make an}} airdrop. The planes mistakenly dropped their bundles of ammunition and food on the North Korean positions. Immediately after the airdrops, two F-51 Mustang fighter planes came over and attacked D Company, also in error. Soon after this aerial attack, North Korean troops attacked the positions.|$|E
5|$|By the 7th century, {{there was}} no active Teotihuacan {{presence}} at any Maya site {{and the center of}} Teotihuacan had been razed by 700. Even after this, formal war attire illustrated on monuments was Teotihuacan style. Jasaw Chan K'awiil I and his heir Yik'in Chan K'awiil continued hostilities against Calakmul and its allies and imposed firm regional control <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> around Tikal, extending as far as the territory around Lake Petén Itzá. These two rulers were responsible for much of the impressive architecture visible today.|$|E

50|$|The {{remoteness}} {{and habitat}} encourage heathland and woodland birds. Recorded {{are some of}} the commoner species of dragonfly, notably <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> of open water.|$|R
50|$|By the mid-2010s, with {{extensive}} police patrols and redevelopment of <b>the</b> <b>area,</b> violent crimes shifted from Whalley south to Newton, which has taken <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>area's</b> {{reputation of being}} the most dangerous part of Surrey.|$|R
5|$|French {{civilian}} administrators {{struggled with}} the military leaders, and the two forces went {{through a number of}} leadership changes over the territory, until Louis Archinard was appointed military governor in 1892. Archinard led military campaigns against Samori Ture, Ahmadu Tall, and other resistant leaders in the region, with varying success. Archinard's campaigns were often executed through direct military control, without civilian oversight. As costs increased, the French administration decided to replace Archinard's control <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> with a civilian governor, Louis Albert Grodet.|$|E
5|$|Gale force winds {{affected}} the Delmarva Peninsula; on Poplar Island in Talbot County, Maryland, winds peaked at 1600UTC on September 3. The strongest winds {{were confined to}} the Atlantic coastline, with outer rainbands producing heavy rainfall in Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, Maryland. Fierce winds were observed in Cape Henlopen, Delaware, with the strongest gales occurring after the eye passed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 64 BCE, the {{military}} expedition of the Roman general Pompey {{put an end}} to the anarchy prevailing in the Seleucid Empire, and Phoenicia became part of the Roman world. But Roman civil wars continued to disrupt the region until 31 BCE, after which, with the reign of Augustus, the pax romana extended <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>area.</b> The pax romana favored international trade, and local industries in silversmithing, glass, textiles and ceramics developed.|$|E

5|$|In {{advance of}} the storm, {{thousands}} of oil workers were evacuated from Gulf of Mexico oil rigs. In Del Rio, some highways and roads were closed after the initial flooding, in anticipation of more flooding as the system stalled <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>area.</b> Of the 2000 Laredo, Texas residents ordered {{to leave their homes}} in anticipation of the Rio Grande overflowing its banks, only 600 actually did so.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} week of December, a frontal trough stalled south of Bermuda. An upper level {{disturbance}} moved <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> on December 9, and produced widespread convection along the frontal wave. The system moved to the northeast, and based on a developing circulation within the convection, the National Hurricane Center classified the system as a subtropical storm on December 12 while located 275miles (440km) northeast of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of these}} lava flows blocked rivers and streams, {{impounding}} small lakes and ephemeral ponds in the process. About 100,000years ago, basalt from the largest cinder cone in the park, Crater Hill, flowed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>area.</b> The lava traveled into Coalpits and Scoggins Washes {{to the south}} and accumulated to a depth of over 400ft (122m) in the ancestral Virgin River valley near the present-day ghost town of Grafton, Utah. Water impounded behind the two blockages, forming Coalpits Lake and Lake Grafton respectively.|$|E
50|$|During the 13th and 14th centuries the {{descendants}} of these first Hennings spread <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> today known as Germany, Denmark and Norway. Unfortunately all records from this time were destroyed.|$|R
50|$|Ballymoney {{is one of}} twenty-six districts {{created on}} 1 October 1973. It took <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> Ballymoney Urban District Council {{and most of the}} {{surrounding}} Ballymoney Rural District in County Antrim.|$|R
25|$|A small {{eruption}} (VEI 3) {{started on}} 19 May and deposited around 5×107m3 of tephra <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> west and southwest of Hekla, leading to many cattle deaths, probably mainly from fluorosis.|$|R
5|$|The Treaty of Butre {{between the}} Netherlands and Ahanta was signed at Butre (historical spelling: Boutry), Dutch Gold Coast on 27 August 1656. The treaty {{regulated}} {{the jurisdiction of}} the Netherlands and the Dutch West India Company over the town of Butre and the surrounding country of Upper Ahanta, creating a Dutch protectorate <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>area.</b> The treaty lasted until the Dutch departure from the Gold Coast in April 1872.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{designation}} as {{a tropical}} disturbance, the predecessor to Cyclone Bejisa dropped heavy rainfall across the Seychelles. A weather station on Mahé observed 164mm (6.46in) of rain over a 24-hour period beginning on December27. The Farquhar Group were particularly affected, as the storm's incipient central region of convection remained <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> {{for an extended}} period of time.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{residents}} on farming properties {{to the west}} of York heard a large aircraft flying low <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>area.</b> The aircraft seemed to be in trouble because the noise from the engines was changing significantly. At times the engines seemed to be operating normally but on at least one occasion all engine noise ceased for a brief time and then returned as a very loud, high-pitched noise. One resident reported that when all engine noise ceased he could hear a rushing sound until the scream from the engines returned. Several residents reported seeing a bright flash of white light in the distance, followed by a loud crashing and scraping noise. Those closest to the crash could then see the yellow glow of a major fire.|$|E

50|$|Prayer warriors may {{pray for}} individuals, or for entire states or regions. One recent {{development}} has been prayer undertaken by groups of people flying <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> for which they wish to undertake intercession.|$|R
50|$|A {{series of}} storms {{continually}} moving <b>over</b> <b>the</b> same <b>area,</b> dumping heavy rains, can cause flash flooding. Each storm usually produces heavy rain, {{and after a}} significant amount of rain falls from the storms which have moved <b>over</b> <b>the</b> same <b>area,</b> flooding occurs.|$|R
5|$|According to modern-day analysis, a {{tropical}} depression {{developed in the}} Pacific Ocean, south of El Salvador, early on September 27. It drifted northward across Central America and eastern Mexico before emerging into the Gulf of Mexico near Ciudad del Carmen on September 30. Weather reports had indicated low air pressures <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> for several days. It is relatively rare for {{a tropical}} cyclone to cross from the Pacific into the Atlantic, or vice versa, and this storm is among less than a dozen known to have officially done so. Only three other tropical cyclones have crossed from the eastern Pacific into the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Additional laws {{focused on}} {{protecting}} the area's rustic and undeveloped character. In 1948, the Thye-Blatnik Bill authorized {{the government to}} purchase the few remaining privately owned homes and resorts within the area. In 1949, President Harry Truman signed Executive Order 10092 which prohibited aircraft from flying <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> below 4,000 feet. The area was officially named the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in 1958. The Wilderness Act of 1964 organized it as {{a unit of the}} National Wilderness Preservation System. The 1978 Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act established the Boundary Waters regulations much as they are today, with limitations on motorboats and snowmobiles, a permit-based quota system for recreational access, and restrictions on logging and mining within the area.|$|E
5|$|After the Norman Conquest in 1066, feudal {{rule was}} {{established}} in Dorset and {{the bulk of the}} land was divided between the Crown and ecclesiastical institutions. The Normans consolidated their control <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> by constructing castles at Corfe, Wareham and Dorchester {{in the early part of}} the 12th century. Over the next 200 years Dorset's population grew substantially and additional land was enclosed for farming to provide the extra food required. The wool trade, the quarrying of Purbeck Marble and the busy ports of Weymouth, Melcombe Regis, Lyme Regis and Bridport brought prosperity to the county. However, Dorset was devastated by the bubonic plague in 1348 which arrived in Melcombe Regis on a ship from Gascony. The disease, more commonly known as the Black Death, created an epidemic that spread rapidly and wiped out a third of the population of the country.|$|E
50|$|In 1341 a small {{eruption}} (VEI 3) {{started on}} 19 May and deposited around 5×107 m3 of tephra <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> west and southwest of Hekla leading to many cattle deaths, probably mainly from fluorosis.|$|R
40|$|Shallow {{clouds are}} prone to appear over deforested {{surfaces}} whereas deep clouds, much less frequent than shallow clouds, favor forested surfaces. Simultaneous atmospheric soundings at forest and pasture sites during the Rondonian Boundary Layer Experiment (RBLE- 3) elucidate the physical mechanisms responsible for the observed correlation between clouds and land cover. We demonstrate that the atmospheric boundary layer <b>over</b> <b>the</b> forested <b>areas</b> is more unstable and characterized by larger values of the convective available potential energy (CAPE) due to greater humidity than that which is found <b>over</b> <b>the</b> deforested <b>area.</b> <b>The</b> shallow convection <b>over</b> <b>the</b> deforested <b>areas</b> is relatively more active than <b>the</b> deep convection <b>over</b> <b>the</b> forested <b>areas.</b> This greater activity results from a stronger lifting mechanism caused by mesoscale circulations driven by deforestation-induced heterogeneities in land cover...|$|R
50|$|During the {{communist}} regime (1945-1991), Enver Hoxha, {{in order to establish}} control <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> populated by <b>the</b> Greek minority, declared the so-called “minority zones” (Zona e minoritarëve), consisting of 99 villages in the southern districts of Gjirokastër, Sarandë and Delvina.|$|R
