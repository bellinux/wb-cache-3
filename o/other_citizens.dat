A justice system is present to punish criminals, for example, dwarves who injure or kill another dwarf or destroy furniture. Occasionally, a vampire dwarf, with a fake background history, may arrive with a migrant wave and start killing and feeding on the <b>other</b> <b>citizens</b> without being noticed.|$|E

5|$|Bowie renounced his American {{citizenship}} {{and became a}} Mexican citizen on September 30, 1830, after promising to establish textile mills {{in the state of}} Coahuila y Tejas. To fulfill his promise, Bowie entered into partnership with Veramendi to build cotton and wool mills in Saltillo. With his citizenship assured, Bowie now had the right to buy up to 11leagues of public land. He convinced 14 or 15 <b>other</b> <b>citizens</b> to apply for land in order to turn it over to him, giving him 700,000acres (280,000ha) for speculation. Bowie may have been the first to induce settlers to apply for empresario grants, which could then be sold in bulk to speculators as Bowie had. The Mexican government passed laws in 1834 and 1835 that stopped much of the land speculation.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, Victoria had repressive and {{restrictive}} drinking laws, {{including the}} notorious six o'clock closing. Blamey took {{the position that}} it was the job of the police to enforce the laws, even if they did not support them. Many members of the public did not agree with this attitude, maintaining that the police should not uphold such laws. Almost as controversially, Blamey drew a sharp distinction between his personal life and his job. His presence in a hotel after closing time was always welcome, as it meant that drinking could continue, for it was known {{that it would not be}} raided while he was there; but <b>other</b> <b>citizens</b> felt that it was unjust when they were arrested for breaking the same laws.|$|E

The Nelsons, who taught singing back in Arkansas, started their grandchildren in music. Nelson's grandfather bought him a guitar when he was six, and taught him a few chords, and with his sister Bobbie, he sang gospel songs in the local church. He wrote his first song at age seven, {{and when he was}} nine, played guitar for the local band Bohemian Polka. During the summer, the family picked cotton along with <b>other</b> <b>citizens</b> of Abbott. Nelson disliked picking cotton, so he earned money by singing in dance halls, taverns, and honky tonks from age 13, and continuing through high school. Nelson's musical influences were Hank Williams, Bob Wills, Lefty Frizzell, Ray Price, Ernest Tubb, Hank Snow, Django Reinhardt, Frank Sinatra and Louis Armstrong.|$|E

Throughout the game, the player follows the story of a dark, dystopian future in which mankind has been enslaved by the Combine, a mysterious alien enemy. In contrast, Concerned follows the same general path through the story {{established}} by Half-Life 2, but instead follows the adventures of Gordon Frohman, a hapless, lethally clumsy oaf who arrives in City 17 a few weeks before Freeman. Frohman is incredibly naïve and, unlike the <b>other</b> <b>citizens,</b> seems to enjoy living under the rule of the totalitarian administrator, Dr. Breen, and the Combine. He holds an insane reverence for the latter, even going to the point of having a plush doll of a Combine soldier.|$|E
5|$|Justice Potter Stewart, {{joined by}} Justice Hugo Black, dissented. Stewart {{acknowledged}} that the Wolf River Treaty unquestionably conferred hunting and fishing rights on the tribe and its members. He stated that the Termination Act subjected {{the members of the}} tribe to the same laws that all <b>other</b> <b>citizens</b> of Wisconsin were held to, including hunting and fishing regulations. In Stewart's opinion, Public Law 280 had no bearing on the case and the rights were not protected by the Termination Act, so they were lost. Stewart did note that this would have also made the claim for compensation valid under Shoshone Tribe v. United States, regardless of whether Congress intended it or not. He would have reversed the decision of the Court of Claims.|$|E

Many citizens were publicly hanged {{in front of the}} city hall. Some Protestants were hanged, beheaded, and quartered, while some others were dragged onto a publicly displayed pile of bodies. Some Protestant corpses were cut up and the pieces exposed on the city gates.

Wyatt had developed a reputation as a no-nonsense, hard-nosed lawman, but prior to the gunfight in October 1881, he had been involved in only one other shooting, in Dodge City, Kansas during the summer of 1878.|$|E
5|$|A {{social worker}} announces to Brian {{and the rest}} of his family that Brian is sentenced to be put down by a lethal injection, which shocks everyone. While Peter works on Brian's appeal, Brian decides to study the Law as much as he can, and goes to court to defend himself, and finally gets the chance to plead his case before the Quahog City Council. During his parole hearing, he {{references}} the court case Plessy v. Ferguson, but unfortunately for him, the council believes that it's stupid to listen to a dog. Just when Brian is about to be dismissed, Peter steps in and delivers a last-ditch emotional appeal on his behalf. The city council members remain unmoved until Peter bribes them with $20 each, and Brian is immediately freed. The charges against him are finally dropped and the town shows him new respect, allowing him to finally drink out of a water fountain, showing his status to be the same as that of the <b>other</b> <b>citizens</b> of the community. The family returns home and Stewie, in an unusual (at the time) display of respect towards Brian, bows ever so slightly towards him. Brian and Peter are then left alone. Brian licks Peter's face in an endearing dog gesture, and threatens to kill him if he ever tells anyone about it.|$|E

The agreement, known as the Dudley-Chelvanayakam Pact (D-C Pact), was put down on paper and signed by Chelvanayakam and Senanayake on 24 March 1965. Under the Dudley-Chelvanayakam Pact, which was {{a modified version of the}} B-C pact, Senanayake agreed to make Tamil the language of administration and of record in the Northern and Eastern provinces (Tamil Language Special Provisions Act); amend the Languages of Courts Act to allow legal proceedings in the Northern and Eastern provinces to be conducted and recorded in Tamil; establish District Councils vested with powers over mutually agreed subjects; amend the Land Development Ordinance to provide allotment of land to citizens; and grant land under colonization schemes in the Northern and Eastern provinces to landless people in the district, to Tamil-speaking residents from the two provinces, and to <b>other</b> <b>citizens</b> with preference being given to Tamils from other provinces. Senanayake kept the contents of the D-C Pact a secret which allowed Sinhalese nationalists to allege that he had agreed to the division of the country.
