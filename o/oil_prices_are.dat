25|$|The Barnett formula has {{resulted}} in higher per-capita public spending in Scotland than England. Including an allocation of North Sea oil revenue based on geography, Scotland also produced more per capita tax revenue than the UK average {{in the years immediately}} preceding the referendum. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reported in November 2012 that a geographic share of North Sea oil would more than cover the higher public spending, but warned that <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> <b>are</b> volatile and that they are drawn from a finite resource. The Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland report for 2012/13 found that North Sea oil revenue had fallen by 41.5% and that Scotland's public spending deficit had increased from £4.6 billion to £8.6 billion.|$|E
30|$|The {{volatility}} of <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> <b>is</b> accepted to have important effects on economic activity. The fluctuations {{of the commodity}} market prices depend on the rise-and-fall of the <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> so that any sudden increase or decrease in <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> cause economic slowdown and price fluctuations in other commodity prices. As a result, crude <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> forecasting <b>is</b> a very important field of research, and modeling/forecasting <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> <b>is</b> hindered by its intrinsic difficulties such as the high volatility (Wang et al. 2005). As the crude <b>oil</b> spot <b>price</b> series <b>are</b> usually considered as a nonlinear and nonstationary time series, which is interactively affected by many factors, predicting crude <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> accurately <b>is</b> rather challenging (Yu et al. 2008).|$|R
30|$|Cunado and de Gracia (2005) analyse {{the real}} and inflationary effects of <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> shocks for six Asian {{countries}} including Malaysia within the Granger causality framework. In the analysis, various non-linear transformations of <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> <b>are</b> employed. They find evidence that <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> shocks anticipate future variations in output growth and inflation especially when the <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> <b>is</b> expressed in local currencies. For the case of Malaysia, when the US dollar <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> <b>is</b> used, none of the <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> measures <b>is</b> found to Granger cause inflation. Using the <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> in ringgit, they also document the lack of Granger causality that runs from the <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> changes to inflation. However, the positive changes in <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> {{as well as the}} net <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> increase over 12 quarters tend to anticipate future variations in inflation. It should be noted that they do not compute the pass-through parameter and with the use of variables in first difference, the documented relations are short run in nature.|$|R

For example, in January 2007, he voted against the Energy Independence and Security Act, which supporters said would have rescinded $14 billion in tax breaks for oil and gas drillers. In February 2008, he voted against the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act, which supporters said would have eliminated $18 billion in tax benefits for oil companies and substituted tax credits for wind, solar, and other renewable energy sources. In May 2008, he voted against the Energy Improvement and Extension Act, which supporters said contained provisions to cut tax breaks for oil companies and to expand tax breaks for alternative energies like solar and geothermal power, biodiesel fuels, and plug-in hybrid vehicles. In July 2010, he voted against the Consolidated Land, Energy, and Aquatic Resources Act of 2009, which would have removed federal caps on oil companies' liability for oil spills, and would have cut certain tax breaks for oil companies. In February 2011, he voted against a measure to reinstate royalties assessed for oil drilled when <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> <b>are</b> high. In March, April, and May 2011, he voted against measures that would have allowed consideration of legislation to eliminate tax breaks for oil companies and promote production and use of alternative energy sources.|$|E

2500|$|Subsequent protests {{have not}} had as {{significant}} an impact but did result in panic buying in 2005 and again in 2007. The 2007 fuel protests were put together by {{several members of the}} old [...] "TransAction group" [...] from the South of England, reforming as [...] "TransAction 2007". The protests of this period were not widely supported nor did they cause the same disruption as those in previous years. The 2007 protest which took place at the latter end of the year, culminated in 200–300 trucks descending on Central London with the police closing off the A40 fly-over for use as a truck park for the day. Following this, a rally was held at Marble Arch. Later in the day, a deputation went to 10 Downing Street to deliver a formal petition calling for the reduction of UK fuel duty. There were those who felt that the 2007 fuel protests were politically motivated, given that many truck owner operators and farmers would have supported the Conservative Party. The Conservative leader David Cameron gave them his support and promised a “fair fuel stabiliser”, a proposal to limit the price of petrol {{that was part of the}} Conservative manifesto for the 2010 UK general election and was announced to be implemented following the budget of March 2011. The “fair fuel stabiliser” which was meant to lower taxes levied on fuel as the price rose and raise tax as the price fell, in fact tax will still rise as the oil price rises but the tax will be capped at the level of inflation at that time and will be applied twice a year, but when the oil price is falling then the tax can be greater than inflation. Quote from [...] "Overview of Tax Legislation and Rates" [...] section 3.44: [...] "When <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> <b>are</b> high, as now, fuel duty will increase by the retail prices index (RPI). However, if the oil price falls below a set trigger price on a sustained basis, the Government will increase fuel duty by RPI plus 1 penny per litre. The Government believes that a trigger price of $75 per barrel would be appropriate, and will set a final trigger price and mechanism after seeking the views of oil and gas companies and motoring groups".|$|E

30|$|The {{analysis}} of this paper shows that {{the characteristics of the}} economic system depicted by the constructed SAM affect the simulation results. As is aforementioned, a fall in crude <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> impacts the economy, so import demand increases. This in turn affects the Petroleum Products, and this sector in turn affects the industry sector that is linked with the Petroleum Products sector. The size of the effects of change in crude <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> <b>is</b> can be seen to be dependent on the makeup of the inputs for that sector. If the inputs are largely composed of Petroleum Products, the effects of changes in crude <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> <b>are</b> large. However, if the share of inputs to itself is relatively large, then the effects of the change in crude <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> may <b>be</b> muted or even shown to have an adverse effect on outputs.|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} dollar exchange rate and crude <b>oil</b> <b>price.</b> Unlike previous literature which established a bilateral causal {{relationship between the two}} prices, this paper proposes that gold <b>price</b> <b>is</b> likely to be a common driver of the two prices and therefore, the bilateral relationship is a part of a triangular system of gold price, dollar exchange rate and crude <b>oil</b> <b>price.</b> The results show that while in the short run gold price movement does not Granger cause the movement of the dollar exchange rate and crude <b>oil</b> <b>price,</b> it <b>is</b> the Granger causality between the two prices in the long run. Causality is also identified from dollar exchange rate to crude <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> in both short run and long run. But crude <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> <b>is</b> much less influential in its bilateral relationship with dollar exchange rate. As a result, a triangular system of gold price, dollar exchange rate and crude <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> <b>is</b> established. Dollar exchange rate not only has direct impacts on crude <b>oil</b> <b>price,</b> but also functions as an intermediary vehicle through which gold price movement indirectly affects crude <b>oil</b> <b>price.</b> However, the relationship between dollar exchange rate and crude <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> <b>is</b> unstable with multiple structural breaks over the sample period. This partially explains why previous studies have mixed results. ...|$|R

40|$|Concerns {{over the}} <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> has <b>been</b> long subdued since <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> <b>were</b> {{maintained}} on a stable level for many years. The recent run-up in <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> renewed interests from both academics and policymakers {{not only because}} it exhibited a record-breaking price level, but also the macroeconomic impacts of oil shocks were so different from the experiences in the 1970 s. Historically, most of the previous <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> shocks <b>are</b> due to supply contractions from wars and geopolitical uncertainty tied in oil-exporting countries. The latest rise in <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> <b>is</b> understood to have sprouted from increased world demands. The first goal of the paper is to verify whether this assertion still holds true in the Korean case. We investigate the nature of recent <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> run-up {{and its impact on the}} Korean macroeconomy with a 4 -variable structural VAR. We find that there have been a dramatic change in the macroeconomic responses to <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> in recent years. We also study whether monetary policy responds optimally to stabilize the macroeconomy in recent years.

30|$|Economic {{feasibility}} {{is a key}} to {{the development}} of deep hydrocarbon exploration and can decide the exploration direction. It is related to development costs and profits.

According to research by some scholars, drilling costs increase exponentially, instead of linearly, as the depth increases (Guan et al. 2012). Profits are mainly affected by <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> and output. The higher the <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> <b>is,</b> the more output there will be, and the more profit it will bring.
