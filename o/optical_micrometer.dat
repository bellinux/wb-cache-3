40|$|AbstractPurpose: Increases in the {{phosphorylation}} {{of a small}} {{heat shock}} protein (HSP 20) are associated with cyclic nucleotide-dependent vasorelaxation. The effect of pressure and flow on vessel diameter was studied. We hypothesized that physiologic conditions that induce vasorelaxation would lead to increases in HSP 20 phosphorylation. Methods: Flow-dependent changes in vessel diameter, at different intraluminal pressures, were measured with a laser <b>optical</b> <b>micrometer</b> in intact bovine carotid arteries. Experiments were performed in the presence and absence of norepinephrine (10 - 5 mol/L). Increases in the phosphorylation of HSP 20 were determined with isoelectric focusing immunoblots. Results: The increase in vessel diameter was most significant at low intraluminal pressures (20 mm Hg), high flow rates (200 mL/min), and {{in the presence of}} the vasoconstrictor norepinephrine (10 - 5 mol/L). The addition of methylene blue (a guanylate cyclase inhibitor) completely inhibited flow-induced vasodilation. Under conditions in which maximal flow induced vasodilation occurred, there were significant increases in the phosphorylation of HSP 20. Conclusion: Flow-dependent vasodilation in isolated perfused segments of bovine carotid arteries was maximal when the intraluminal pressures were low and when the vessels were precontracted with norepinephrine. Flow-dependent vasodilation was inhibited by methylene blue and was associated with increases in the phosphorylation of HSP 20, suggesting that the vasodilation was mediated by endothelial production of nitric oxide.

Fretting wear {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate {{the effects of the}} contacting shapes of spacer grid springs on the wear behavior of a nuclear fuel rod in room temperature air and water. The main objective was to quantitatively compare the wear behavior of the nuclear fuel rod with the variation of the contacting spring shapes. The variation of the real worn area in the wear scar, the change in the wear volume and the maximum wear depth with the slip amplitude were calculated and measured through an <b>optical</b> <b>micrometer</b> and surface profilometry. The results of the wear tests showed that the wear volume and the maximum wear depth were sensitively affected by each spring shape with increasing slip amplitude and with a change of the test environment. From the analysis of the wear scar, it is possible to separate the size of the wear scar from the real worn area and the transferred one. In addition, we found that the wear volume has a linear relation with the real worn area rather than the size of the wear scar and this was only determined by using each spring shape even though the wear tests were carried out with different conditions. From the above results, it is possible to evaluate a wear resistant spring by using the correlation between the variation of the real worn area and the wear behavior at each spring shape...|$|E
40|$|Abdominal aortic aneurysms are a focal {{dilation}} of the aorta {{which can}} be potentially life threatening if left untreated. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is a noninvasive treatment that can reduce the mortality rate {{when compared to the}} standard open repair. Yet, EVAR is associated with other complications that can arise such as migration, endoleaks, or device related failures. These complications drive the need for reinterventions which have been shown to occur more frequently with EVAR than with open repair. The long term fixation and sealing characteristics of these devices is likely related to the nature of its apposition to the aortic wall. Currently there is little understanding of these mechanics and factors in how the device performs at the time of deployment. A computational model that reflects the compressive nature of an endovascular graft is beneficial in investigating these mechanics. The aims of the study are; 1) formulate an experimental methodology that captures the radial compressive nature of the stent graft, 2) develop a parameterized finite element model of the stent structure, and 3) compare the compressive behavior this model against the acquired experimental data. A 2 mil polyethylene sleeve was used to transfer a compressive vacuum pressure from the sleeve onto 10 independent stent grafts. The loading-unloading pressure was cycled from 0 to - 50 mmHg (complete collapse) over 5 minutes. A pressure transducer and <b>optical</b> <b>micrometer</b> were used to capture the vacuum pressure and diameter relationship. All ten grafts compressed in a similar elliptical shape configuration.

A dynamic quasi-static computational simulation was completed that included large deformations and contact between the sleeve and stent as well as self-contact in the sleeve. Our results show that the model is representative of the experiments and can be used to interrogate how a stent graft will perform during certain stages of deployment and immediately after deployment with some caution in regard to the stated limitations...|$|E

Surgical outcomes after bilioenteric drainage procedures are variable. This study attempts to correlate the pre- and post-operative liver histology with clinical factors in order to define early predictors of success. Materials and Methods: Twenty consecutive patients, treated by Kasai′s portoenterostomy (KP) over a 3 years period were included in this study. Tissue obtained from the porta hepatis was analyzed for duct size using an <b>optical</b> <b>micrometer</b> and was categorized into three types: I-No demonstrable ducts; II - 50 μ. Pre- and post-operative liver biopsy was analyzed for architectural changes and fibrosis; hepatic fibrosis was quantified using existing criteria. Pre- and post-operative liver function tests (LFTs) were also done. Surgical outcomes were defined as: (A) Disappearance of jaundice within 3 months; (B) initial disappearance of jaundice with recurrence by 6 months and (C) persistence of jaundice. Duct diameters, fibrosis score, and LFT were correlated with age and clinical outcomes. Results: The surgical outcomes were: A- 6 patients (30 %), B- 6 patients (30 %), C- 8 patients (40 %). The duct size at the porta was I- 3 patients, II- 11 patients, and III- 4 patients (tissue was not available in 2 cases). The change in total serum bilirubin (mg%) from pre- to post-operative period was 13. 6 ± 3. 9 (Group A), 4. 6 ± 2. 8 (Group B), and 3. 4 ± 3. 9 (group C) (P < 0. 001) and direct and indirect fractions followed a similar trend; the changes in liver enzymes were not significant. The changes in hepatic histopathological changes (ballooning of hepatocytes, giant cells, cholestasis, portal tract infiltration, ductular proliferation, lobular necrosis, and fibrosis) were also not significant but there was a definite trend in the change in fibrosis - 1. 500 ± 1. 643 (Group A), 0. 667 ± 2. 582 (Group B), and 1. 500 ± 1. 852 (Group C) - reduction of fibrosis with good results and progression of fibrosis with poor results. Conclusions: Following KP, jaundice persisted in 40 % patients; it disappeared in 60 % patients but reappeared in half of these patients 6 months postoperatively. The duct size at the porta hepatis did not correlate with age or surgical outcome. Serum bilirubin showed the best correlation with surgical outcome.

Tissue engineering (TE) has already offered clinical solutions in the areas of skin and cartilage regeneration and is advancing in several research fields, such as vascular graft replacements. In order for TE constructs to be cultivated and conditioned under a controlled environment, bioreactors systems are used, that can maintain physiological O 2 and CO 2 concentrations and can apply stresses and strains to promote the proliferation of cells and the production of extracellular matrix proteins. In the case of cardiovascular TE, conditioning under pulsatile pressure is common practice by many groups. In this study a bioreactor system is presented that can apply adjustable pressure pulse profiles to vascular grafts under a controlled environment. In addition, it can perform diameter measurement of the vessels in vitro so that the compliance of the vessel can be calculated. The compliance, which is the relative change of volume of a vessel due to a pressure change, is an excellent measure of its mechanical condition and can be used to monitor the development and maturation of the newly formed tissue. The system uses a centrifugal pump that pumps cell culture medium from a reservoir and supplies a perfusion bioreactor. Medium flows both through and around the vessel and its blood gas values, namely the partial pressures of O 2 and CO 2 and its pH value are monitored with the respective sensors in another chamber. A linear motor with a piston controlled by a computer applies pulses through a silicone membrane. An application developed in Labview® is used to generate the pulses, record the pressure, the flow and the blood gas values and the diameter of the vessel through an <b>optical</b> <b>micrometer.</b> The system was evaluated with experiments that lasted up to 4 weeks, where TE vessels and native porcine carotid arteries were cultivated and conditioned.

By using this design, the pressure shell will not have to carry the loads resulting from the internal mass. I worked with another intern to create the initial design for the module, with him focusing on the core and myself focusing on the pressure shell. To start, I was given the shell overall dimensions and material and tasked with sizing the wall thickness and placing stiffeners such that the shell could withstand the required loads. At the same time, I had to keep the mass to a minimum to keep the overall module within the allowable launch mass. Once I had done initial sizing based on pressure loads, I combined the pressure shell with the inner core to perform optimization of the design. Currently, the design involves circumferential stiffeners along {{the entire length of the}} pressure shell with longitudinal stiffeners on either end. In addition, extra wall thickness was added around each of the hatches. At this stage, the design shows a comparable mass to a more traditional design, but we are hopeful that, through optimization, we will be able to reduce the mass even further. There is currently a patent pending for the module design, for which I am listed as a co-inventor. ALON Material Testing: I was given samples of aluminum oxynitride (ALON) that had been impacted by a previous intern on which to perform residual strength tests as part of a plan to approve them for space use. Before testing, I measured the pucks and their damages using a ruler and <b>optical</b> <b>micrometer</b> in order to verify that the puck dimensions were within the tolerances set by the test guidelines and that the damages had not grown when the pucks were thinned. The test was a ring-ring test, which used two concentric rings to place the ring in axisymmetric bending, with the puck set up so that the damaged side was always in tension. Though I was unable to do the setup of the test or run the load machine due to a period of changing test procedures, I was able to observe the testing and perform the data collection. The pucks behaved as expected, breaking at the damage, as did the strengths calculated from the data, being lower than for the unimpacted pucks and having less scatter between the puck values. The attached image is of myself during the ALON strength testing. Over the course of my internship, I was able to learn much more about real-life structural analysis and about the behavior of materials, and it confirmed my previous interest in structural analysis.

40|$|Vertically-aligned carbon {{nanotube}} (VACNT) arrays are both an important technological system, and a fascinating system for studying {{basic principles of}} nanomaterial synthesis. However, despite continuing efforts for the past decade, important questions about this process remain largely unexplained. Recently, nanotube research investigations have been conducted, aiming at revealing the underlying growth mechanisms, rather than merely studying the feasibility on new growth methods. Nonetheless, growth deactivation and the accompanying termination mechanisms still remain a topic of nanotube synthesis science. Due to the extremely small size, however, direct characterization of various transport and conversion events occurring at the catalyst surface {{is not an easy}} task. Thus investigations on growth kinetics are the first step to resolve questions about growth mechanism. Before exploring kinetic aspects of the growth process, one must achieve reliable growth conditions since growth non-reproducibility retards obtaining reliable growth data and undermines the scientific value of the data. In order to improve growth reliability, several factors that may contribute to growth non-reproducibility were identified and thereafter mitigated. Firstly, a simulation study was conducted to achieve insight into temperature and velocity profile of gases inside the reactor since gas flow dynamics can render growth environment near the substrate non-uniform. Interestingly, when argon gas was used as the main carrier gas, natural convective flow emerged, generating flow circulation before the gas reached the substrate placed {{at the center of the}} tube reactor. This flow circulation was not favorable for controlled gas introduction. This problem could be resolved by using a more heat- and momentum- conductive gas such as helium. Secondly, atomic force microscopy of annealed catalyst revealed that the aluminum sub-layer was not thermally stable at the growth temperature although this material has been widely used as a barrier layer to avoid silicide formation of catalyst on silicon substrates. In this respect, aluminum oxide should be a better choice, but under-stoichiometry of the aluminum oxide layer, which originated from sputter target degradation, affected thermal stability of the layer. Reactive sputtering by oxygen addition greatly enhanced thermal stability, and finally defect-free catalyst nanoparticles were formed by thermal annealing. Thirdly, the effect of the small part-per-million levels of oxygen-containing species on VACNT growth revealed that oxygen-containing gas impurities in nominally pure gas sources have a great influence on growth kinetics in a positive way; their presence increases catalyst lifetime and growth yield. However, the kinetic behavior that is highly sensitive to gas purity is prone to showing an interfering kinetic trend where the real mechanism is masked by the significant gas impurity effect. The stark difference in catalytic lifetime after the introduction of high-performance gas purifiers shows that extremely tight control of the reaction gas composition purity is necessary to obtain controlled growth of CNTs under atmospheric chemical vapor deposition (CVD) conditions. Finally, more reliable growth of VACNTs was achieved, and thereafter the next step for fundamental growth kinetics measurement was followed. Finally, the CVD system was equipped with an <b>optical</b> <b>micrometer</b> that enables in-situ measurement of the height of growing VACNTs, which have advantageous structure facilitating measurement of growth kinetics since the array height has a robust correlation with growth yield and thereby growth rate. Various ethylene and hydrogen combinations were examined to capture growth kinetics related to different gas environment. The measured initial growth rates were linearly proportional to ethylene concentration, whereas a reciprocal relation was observed with respect to hydrogen concentration. The apparent activation energy was higher than reported in references. Flow rate variation experiments revealed that gas phase reaction is involved as the crucial growth step, which supports the observed high activation energy. Consequently, a growth model was proposed so that it could reasonably fit the initial growth rate data. Kinetic aspects related to growth deactivation were explored by measuring the final growth height and catalyst lifetime. Unlike growth with unpurified gases, growth became much less sensitive to gas composition after purification. Importantly, it was observed that growth deactivates by deficit of carbon source when relatively low ethylene was introduced. This result is surprising since ethylene pressure should be high enough at the catalyst, considering the calculated sticking coefficient of ethylene is very low, approximately 10 ^- 5. Thus it substantiates the idea that catalyst-mediated gas pretreatment process is critical to sustain nanotube growth. Importantly, this idea challenges the widely accepted growth termination concept whereby nanotube stops growing due to catalyst encapsulation by excessive carbon. Indeed, reduced flow rate of gas mixture increased growth yield remarkably by promoting the gas pretreatment over the catalyst. Catalyst ripening, or steric hindrance by interaction of nanotubes can be an alternative reason for growth termination, but analysis of morphologies of the annealed catalyst and as-grown nanotubes revealed that their effects were not significant for the corresponding growth conditions...|$|E

It is demonstrated for the first time, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, that the use of micrometric-thin cells (MTCs, L≈ 40 [*][*]μm) allows application of SA for quantitative studies of frequency splitting and shifts of the Rb atomic transitions in a wide range of external magnetic fields, from 0. 2 up to 6 kG (20 – 600 mT). We compare the SA spectra obtained with the MTC with those obtained with other techniques and present applications for <b>optical</b> magnetometry with <b>micrometer</b> spatial resolution and a broadly tunable optical frequency lock...|$|R

Two {{characteristic}} features have been incorporated in the device structure: An AlGaInP barrier which provides a larger conduction band offset than the commonly used AlGaAs and a highly carbon-doped p-type GaAs gate structure which supports a very simple, self-aligned fabrication scheme. Using 1 <b>micrometer</b> <b>optical</b> lithography we have fabricated first demonstrator devices with a current gain cut-off frequency of 60 GHz and a power gain cut-off frequency of 140 GHz.

40|$|We {{present a}} study of optically-induced {{molecular}} relaxation and optical writing processes in a photosensitive liquid crystalline polymer, containing the azobenzene moiety in the side chain. Linear and non linear ESR spectroscopies, thermal analysis and rheology investigations carried on azo polymethacrylate (PMA) samples subjected to different thermal treatments have allowed to single out a suitable procedure to get stable, homogeneous substrates. <b>Optical</b> studies on <b>micrometer</b> length scale, adopting the selected procedure, have confirmed the stability conditions in both unaligned and aligned samples. The temperature dependence of the bit stability has been determined. The writing threshold power and writing rate have been measured.

A compact and flat apparatus {{will be presented to}} conduct 2 -point-bending tests as well as tensile tests in situ on a High Resolution X-Ray Diffraction (HRXRD) instrument or under an <b>optical</b> microscope. Specific <b>micrometer</b> sized Single Crystal Silicon devices were manufactured and loaded until fracture. The measured Young’s modulus confirms the reliability of the new procedures and observed fracture strengths are in very good agreement with previous findings from the literature. In situ HRXRD measurements by means of Rocking Curves and Reciprocal Space Mappings of local deformations were performed and compared with the results of a corresponding Finite Element model and analyzed for defects respectively...|$|R
40|$|Colloidal {{structures}} in confined nematics offer novel routes for designing complex <b>optical</b> materials with <b>micrometer</b> and submicrometre functionality. In this paper, we review {{some of our}} recently assembled colloidal structures that form in confined nematic cells. We present effective elastic binding via nematic distortion as a mechanism for the assembly of two-dimensional colloidal crystals of elastic dipoles and elastic quadrupoles. We introduce entangled colloids as novel types of structures, where particles are topologically bound by delocalised defect loops, producing robust and possibly chiral structures. The concept of hierarchical assembly is demonstrated in colloids with particles of various scales. In cholesteric blue phases, the assembly of three-dimensional colloidal crystals is shown based on naturally occurring three-dimensional arrays of trapping sites produced by blue phases. © 2011 Taylor and Francis...|$|R
40|$|A {{reference}} signal of RF frequency modulates a 0. 85 <b>micrometer</b> wavelength <b>optical</b> transmitter. The output of which {{passes through a}} first optical filter and a voltage-controller phase shifter. The output of the phase shifter is provided to the fiber optic transmission line. At {{the receiving end of}} the transmission line, the signal is demodulated and used to modulate a 1. 06 <b>micrometer</b> <b>optical</b> transmitter. The signal from the transmitter is provided to the fiber optic transmission line and passes through the voltage-controlled phase shifter to a phase error detector. The phase of the modulation of the 1. 06 micrometer wavelength signal is compared to the phase of the {{reference signal}} by the phase error detector. A phase control signal related to the phase difference is provided to the voltage controlled phase shifter which alters the phase of both optical signals until a predetermined phase relationship between modulation on the 1. 06 micrometer signal and the reference signal is obtained...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties {{of aluminium alloys}} can {{be affected by the}} local high temperature in laser welding. In this paper, an inversion identification method of local zone-wise elastic-plastic constitutive parameters for laser welding of aluminium alloy 6061 was proposed based on full-field optical measurement data using digital image correlation (DIC). Three regions, i. e., the fusion zone, heat-affected zone, and base zone, of the laser-welded joint were distinguished by means of microstructure <b>optical</b> observation and <b>micrometer</b> hardness measurement. The stress data were obtained using a laser-welded specimen via a uniaxial tensile test. Meanwhile, the local strain data of the laser-welded specimen were obtained by the DIC technique. Thus, the stress–strain relationship for different local regions was established. Finally, the constitutive parameters of the Ramberg–Osgood model were identified by least-square fitting to the experimental stress–strain data. Experimental results revealed that the {{mechanical properties}} of the local zones of the welded joints clearly weakened, and these results are consistent with the results of the hardness measurement...|$|R
40|$|Photoacoustic (optoacoustic) tomography, {{combining}} {{optical absorption}} contrast and highly scalable spatial resolution (from <b>micrometer</b> <b>optical</b> resolution to millimeter acoustic resolution), has broken through the fundamental penetration limit of optical ballistic imaging modalities—including confocal microscopy, two-photon microscopy, and optical coherence tomography—and has achieved high spatial resolution at depths {{down to the}} diffusive regime. Optical absorption contrast is highly desirable for microvascular imaging and characterization {{because of the presence}} of endogenous strongly light-absorbing hemoglobin. We focus on the current state of microvascular imaging and characterization based on photoacoustics. We first review the three major embodiments of photoacoustic tomography: microscopy, computed tomography, and endoscopy. We then discuss the methods used to characterize important functional parameters, such as total hemoglobin concentration, hemoglobin oxygen saturation, and blood flow. Next, we highlight a few representative applications in microvascular-related physiological and pathophysiological research, including hemodynamic monitoring, chronic imaging, tumor-vascular interaction, and neurovascular coupling. Finally, several potential technical advances toward clinical applications are suggested, and a few technical challenges in contrast enhancement and fluence compensation are summarized...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{there has}} been a trend towards {{combining}} multiple forms of additive manufacturing together for increased functionality, freedom and efficiency. In this work, two forms of multiple-material additive manufacturing technologies - inkjet and direct-ink writing - are combined in a hybrid system. Several advantages are realized due to the increased material library and geometric freedom as a result of new printing modalities. Initially, models of each process are reviewed and the processes are evaluated for compatibility. Then, the precision machine design of a passively-indexed, carousel-style, syringe tool holder is completed. An error budget employing Homogeneous Transformation Matrices was maintained to estimate the tooltip errors. In order to register these two non-contact printing processes, a unique approach to their registration to a common global origin was necessary. A single non-contact <b>optical</b> CCD <b>micrometer</b> is used to register the three spatial coordinates of the syringe tooltip. Measurements are performed to characterize the repeatability of the nozzle registration scheme and the constructed gantry and carousel system, which well exceeds the requirements and the predictions from the conservative error budget. This novel system can print with a wide array of inks, including those that solidify via polymerization or crosslinking, two part chemistries, solvent evaporation or sintering, as well as liquids, gels and pastes. These materials can have a wide range of mechanical properties and functionalities, for example electrical conductivity or force sensitive resistivity. Models for the extrudate flow rate are used alongside experimental determination of the extrudate cross-section to ensure accurate process congruence. Finally, printed results demonstrate the various printing techniques, highlight the expanded material library, and display novel assemblies not possible with conventional additive processes. One such example is a fully printed pressure sensor array. by Nicholas Graham Bandiera. Thesis: S. M., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Mechanical Engineering, 2017.

40|$|The energy {{consumption}} due to pumping {{power is a}} crucial issue in membrane processes. Spacers provide mechanical stability and promote mixing, yet increasing pressure drop. Woven spacers and their behaviour at low Reynolds numbers are less studied in the literature. Nevertheless, they are typical of some membrane technologies, as reverse electrodialysis (RED). RED is a promising technology for electric power generation by the chemical potential difference of two salt solutions within a stack equipped by selective ion-exchange membranes. The mechanical energy required for pumping the feed solutions, can dramatically reduce the net power output. In this work computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of spacer-filled channels at low Reynolds numbers were carried out in parallel with an experimental campaign focused on the collection of data for model validation. Woven spacers 280 â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3480 Î¼m thick were investigated at the flow rates typical of RED channels. The construction of the computational domain was based on measurements made by <b>optical</b> microscopy and <b>micrometer.</b> Fully developed flow conditions were assumed, thus, periodic boundary conditions were adopted (unit cell approach). The experiments were carried out in a flow cell with one channel. Pressure drops were measured with and without the spacer, in order to quantify the effect of inletâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 outlet channel and identify the distributed pressure drops due to the woven nets.
