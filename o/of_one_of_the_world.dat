2500|$|In {{keeping with}} the lack of {{explanation}} about the marriage, not much is revealed of the characters' back-stories. It is known that Basil served in the British Army and saw action in the Korean War, possibly as part of his National Service. (John Cleese himself was only 13 when the Korean War ended, making the character of Basil at least five or six years older than he.) Basil exaggerates this period of his life, proclaiming to strangers, [...] "I killed four men." [...] To this Sybil jokes that [...] "He was in the Catering Corps. He used to poison them." [...] Basil often is seen wearing regimental and old boy ties, no doubt spuriously. He also claims to have sustained a shrapnel injury to his leg; it tends to flare up at suspiciously convenient times. The only person Basil consistently exhibits tolerance and good manners towards is the old and senile Major Gowen, a veteran <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> wars (which one never is specified, though he once mentions to Mrs. Peignoir that he was in France in 1918) who permanently resides at the hotel. When interacting with Manuel, Basil displays a rudimentary ability with Spanish (Basil states that he [...] "learned classical Spanish, not the strange dialect he [...] seems to have picked up"); this ability also is ridiculed, as in the first episode in which a guest, whom Basil has immediately dismissed as working-class, communicates fluently with Manuel in Spanish after Basil is unable to do so.|$|E
2500|$|Soon after Barnard {{released}} NESARA on the internet, a user {{known as}} [...] "Dove of Oneness" [...] began posting {{about it in}} internet forums. [...] "Dove of Oneness" [...] was later identified as Shaini Candace Goodwin, {{a former student of}} The Ramtha School Of Enlightenment, referred to in the media as a [...] "cybercult queen." [...] According to Goodwin's website, the NESARA bill languished in Congress before finally being passed by a secret session in March 2000 and signed by President Bill Clinton. It is claimed that the new law was to be implemented at 10 am on September 11, 2001, but that the computers, and data (of the beneficiaries of the trillions of dollars of [...] "Prosperity funds") were destroyed on the second floor <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Trade Center towers in New York City during the terrorist attacks. [...] Supposedly an earlier gag order issued by the Supreme Court had prohibited any official or private source from discussing it, under penalty of death. Goodwin referred to [...] "White Knights," [...] most of them high-ranking military officials, who have since been struggling to have the law implemented despite opposition by President George W. Bush. Goodwin allegedly believes and purports that Bush orchestrated the September 11, 2001 attacks and the Iraq War as distractions from NESARA. Goodwin's description of NESARA goes far beyond Barnard's proposal by cancelling all personal debts, abolishing the Internal Revenue Service, declaring world peace, and requiring new presidential and congressional elections. Goodwin often claimed that Bush officials were attempting to hack into and bring down her web site to prevent her from publicizing the law.|$|E
