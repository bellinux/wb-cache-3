40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to on-going empirical {{search for an}} appropriate crude oil price benchmark that ensures greater financial stability and efficient fiscal management in Nigeria. It adopted the seasonally adjusted ARIMA forecasting models using monthly data series from 2000 m 01 to 2012 m 12 to predict future movement in Nigeria crude oil prices. The paper derived a more robust and dynamic framework that accommodates fluctuation in crude oil price and also in government spending. The result shows that if the incessant withdrawal from the ECA fund and the increasing debt profile of government in recent times are factored into the benchmark, the real crude oil numerical fiscal rule is (US$ 82. 3) for 2013 which {{is higher than the}} official benchmark of $ 75 used for 2013 and 2014 budget proposal. The paper argues that the current long run price rule based on 5 - 10 year moving average approach adopted by government is rigid and inflexible as a rule for managing Nigerian oil funds. The unrealistic assumption of the extant benchmark accounted for excessive depletion and lack of accountability of the excess crude <b>oil</b> <b>account.</b> The paper concludes that except the federal government can curtail its spending profligacy and adopts a more stringent fiscal discipline rules, the current benchmark is unrealistic and unsuitable for fiscal management of oil revenue in the context of Nigerian economic spending profile...|$|E

40|$|Exports {{of crude}} <b>oil</b> <b>account</b> for {{one-third of the}} {{combined}} Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and two-thirds of their total exports. The economic crisis in Euro-zone and decelerating economic growth in emerging markets in Asia have led oil exporters from MENA to focus on security of demand for their exportable quantity of crude oil. Oil security in international relations theories is related {{to a number of}} approaches, which are often overlapping and coexistent. The general perception (hypothesis) about oil security from the oil exporters’ perspective is that, it is closely associated with uninterrupted exports (demand) of their produced oil at a reasonable price for economic well-being (security) of its citizens. Therefore, the theorisation of ‘security’ for oil exporters would generally involve proving empirically, the influence of crude oil exports on economic well-being of the citizens. There is restricted amount of literature that empirically tests how the dynamic change in export quantity of crude oil affects economic well-being of the citizens of oil exporting countries of the MENA region. This paper is an attempt to fill this literature gap by finding the causal relationship between oil export quantity (proxy to oil security) and per capita GDP (proxy to economic well being), of the top five crude oil exporters of MENA region, namely Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Iran and UAE in order to consolidate or contradict the general perception of oil security from the net oil exporters perspective...|$|E

Environmental metabolomics is an emerging field that may help unravel {{the effect of these}} xenobiotics on seaweeds and provide methodologies for biomonitoring coastal ecosystems. In the present study, FTIR and multivariate analysis were used to discriminate metabolic profiles of Ulva lactuca after in vitro exposure to diesel oil and gasoline, in combinations of concentrations (0. 001 %, 0. 01 %, 0. 1 %, and 1. 0 % - v/v) and times of exposure (30  min, 1  h, 12  h, and 24  h). PCA and HCA performed on entire mid-infrared spectral window were able to discriminate diesel oil-exposed thalli from the gasoline-exposed ones. HCA performed on spectral window related to the protein absorbance (17001500  cm  1) enabled the best discrimination between gasoline-exposed samples regarding the time of exposure, and between diesel oil-exposed samples according to the concentration. The results indicate that the combination of FTIR with multivariate analysis is a simple and efficient methodology for metabolic profiling with potential use for biomonitoring strategies.

40|$|Introduction: Nowadays, gas and <b>oil</b> <b>account</b> for 60 {{percent of}} world energy resources. Transporting crude oil and its {{products}} are accomplished {{through a number}} of ways among which pipelines are of the utmost significance. Considering the extent of pipelines in installation and residential areas and also high potential for damage, the safety of these pipes and application of risk management principles have undeniable importance. Bow-tie risk assessment method is one of the ways to determine safety level. The tool is a qualitative and semi-quantitative method the data of which are implemented by specialists and experts via conducting surveys.    Method and material: In the present study, Bow-tie technique was employed having been combined with fuzzy logic in which Likret Scale was applied to quantify the qualitative (verbal) data to reduce the uncertainty of risk evaluation of Amaak No. 10 gas pipeline and Bongestan No. 12 petroleum pipeline. In this way, factors affecting the pipeline safety were at first, recognized through the checklists. Then, the risk evaluation of pipplines was conducted using the mentioned method.   Results: The results of the study showed that third party damages, initial defects in materials, and constructing pipeline with failure possibility of 0. 0484 stood at the highest in terms of importance (equivalent to 12. 32 %) in destroying oil and gas pipelines. In addition, the toxic impacts and environmental damages with occurrence possibility of 0. 00327 were the most striking consequences of gas and oil leakage based on event tree analysis.   Conclusion: Considering the recognized factors leading to destruction of pipelines and their most notable outcomes, instructions on how to control and reduce the potential consequences were suggested, with emphasis on the removal of the most probable causes...|$|E
