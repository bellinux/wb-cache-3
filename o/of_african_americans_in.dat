5|$|He later {{published}} {{two articles}} in the National Urban League's journal, , that discussed the difficulties faced by African-American mineworkers. His work in this field also addressed his concern about blacks and their white counterparts. Harris examined race prejudice of blacks by white workers. Meanwhile, Harris taught at West Virginia State University, a small historically black public college in Institute, West Virginia. During this year, he began a long and sustaining friendship with V. F. Calverton. He taught for a year, before he shifted directions and took the position {{as director of the}} Minneapolis Urban League. As director, he prepared a detailed report titled The Negro Population in Minneapolis: A Study of Race Relations dealing with the living conditions <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>in</b> Minneapolis, Minnesota. Harris described the physical and socio-economic conditions <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>in</b> Minneapolis in 1926.|$|E
5|$|Emmett Louis Till (July 25, 1941– August 28, 1955) was a 14-year-old African-American who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955, after a {{white woman}} said she was {{offended}} by him in her family's grocery store. The brutality of his murder {{and the fact that}} his killers were acquitted drew attention to the long history of violent persecution <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>in</b> the United States.

5|$|The {{private sector}} {{was not the}} only source of racism: under President Wilson, the plight <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>in</b> {{government}} jobs suffered. Many federal agencies adopted whites-only employment practices, the Army excluded blacks from officer ranks, and the immigration service prohibited the immigration of persons of African ancestry. Du Bois wrote an editorial in 1914 deploring the dismissal of blacks from federal posts, and he supported William Monroe Trotter when Trotter brusquely confronted Wilson about Wilson's failure to fulfill his campaign promise of justice for blacks.|$|E
5|$|The {{story has}} been read as an {{analysis}} of race relations, not {{between black and white}} but within the black community, exploring its own color and class prejudices.

5|$|The CLB {{directors}} concurred, and on January 19, 1920, {{they formed}} an organization {{under a new}} name, the American Civil Liberties Union. Although {{a handful of other}} organizations in the United States at that time focused on civil rights, such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the ACLU was the first that did not represent a particular group of persons, or a single theme. Like the CLB, the NAACP pursued litigation to work on civil rights, including efforts to overturn the disfranchisement <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>in</b> the South that had taken place {{since the turn of the}} century.|$|E

5|$|The {{massacre}} was {{remembered in}} 1858 in a celebration organized by William Cooper Nell, an African American abolitionist {{who saw the}} death of Crispus Attucks {{as an opportunity to}} demonstrate the role <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>in</b> the Revolutionary War. Partly because of this activism, artwork commemorating the massacre was produced that changed the color of a victim's skin to black (which in Revere's original engraving was white) to emphasize Attucks' claimed martyrdom. In 1888, a monument was erected on the Boston Common to the men killed in the massacre, and the five victims, along with Christopher Seider, were reinterred in a prominent grave in the Granary Burying Ground.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, a {{significant}} number of lynchings occurred in the Southern United States, primarily <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>in</b> the states of Georgia, Mississippi, and Texas. Between 1890 and 1920, about 3,000 African Americans were killed by lynch mobs, usually after whites were the victims of crimes purportedly committed by blacks. Supporters of lynching justified the practice as a way to assert dominance over African Americans, to whom they attributed a criminal nature. Lynching also provided a sense of white solidarity in a culture with changing demographics and power structures. Although lynching was tolerated by much of southern society, opponents of the practice emerged, including some religious leaders and the nascent National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).|$|E
5|$|The fusion effort {{failed and}} Grant was easily reelected. Liberal Republicans {{were unable to}} deliver many votes, and Greeley was only {{successful}} in areas the Democrats would have carried without him. Federal prosecution of the Klan, a strong economy, debt reduction, lowered tariffs, repeal of the income tax, and civil service reforms helped Grant defeat Greeley. Grant won 56 {{percent of the popular}} vote and an Electoral College landslide of 286 to 66. A majority <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>in</b> the South voted for Grant, while Democratic opposition remained mostly peaceful. Grant lost in six former slave states that wanted to see an end to Reconstruction. In 1873 Wilson suffered a stroke; never fully recovering, he died in office on November 22, 1875. With Wilson's loss, Grant relied on Fish's guidance more than ever.|$|E

5|$|The {{growth of}} {{industry}} attracted people {{from within the}} borders of the United States, and from Latin America. By the late 19th century, African Americans were well represented in Youngstown, and the first local congregation of the African Methodist Episcopal Church was established in 1871. In the 1880s, local attorney William R. Stewart was the second African American elected to the Ohio House of Representatives. A large influx <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>in</b> the early 20th century owed much to developments in the industrial sector. During the national Steel Strike of 1919, local industrialists recruited thousands of workers from the South, many of whom were Black. This move inflamed racist sentiment among local Whites, and for decades, African-American steelworkers experienced discrimination in the workplace. Migration from the South rose dramatically in the 1940s, when the mechanization of southern agriculture brought an end to the exploitative sharecropping system, leading onetime farm laborers to seek industrial jobs.|$|E
5|$|The number <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>in</b> the {{territory}} {{during this period}} was quite small but not insignificant. Newcomers continued to bring slaves with them, but there were many free blacks as well, some working as servants and some as completely independent pioneers. Information about the black immigrants during the earlier periods is sparse, but records do show {{that most of those}} at Fort Snelling were slaves. Records from 1850 indicate a population of 39 free blacks out of a total population of 6,077 citizens in {{the territory}} (which excluded Native American tribes). Before the 1840s these free persons could often expect to be treated equal to other racial groups. By the time Minnesota had achieved statehood, however, blacks had been disenfranchised and schools were segregated. Despite this, {{from the start of the}} Minnesota Territory in 1848 the leadership was predominantly antislavery thus ending the practice in this era.|$|E
