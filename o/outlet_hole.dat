40|$|This thesis aims {{to solve}} the basic physics behind the {{collapsible}} tube dripper design used in drip irrigation. A study {{was performed on the}} dynamics of the flow limitation of collapsible tubes. Two parameters were studied: <b>outlet</b> <b>hole</b> diameter and effective length. Prototypes were made varying these parameters, and flow tests were conducted to collect data on pressure and flow rate. Introducing a valve to control the flow significantly improved the control of experiments and the ability to test for pressure compensation. It was found that the <b>outlet</b> <b>hole</b> diameter is directly correlated with outlet flow rate and activation pressure, but indirectly correlated with constancy of flow rate. The impact of effective length on flow rate is still unclear but the results show that there is a possible correlation that may depend on other factors and characteristics of the flow. by Teresa Lin.

While compared with the simulated and measured result of the outlet velocity of the wind outlet small hole, the best feature parameters of wind speed in air supply cylinder has been gained.

40|$|In many {{previous}} studies {{the main focus}} {{was put on the}} pressure distribution in the lubricating gap. Due to the limited space in the gap an investigation of the velocity distribution is very difficult or rather impossible. Based on the geometrical shapes of a real journal bearing, a bearing model test rig with an increased relative gap width has been developed. Thus, it is possible to detect the distribution of the flow speed within the gap by using a Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV). The comparability of the flow to the flow in a real journal bearing is ensured by observing the Reynolds similarity.

A multi-layer mask approach is used to pattern the etch masks on a glass for the consecutive Isotropic wet etching of the glass substrate. Isotropic wet etching is utilized to transfer the patterned structures from a metal mask to the glass and also to under etch the differently sized spacing pitches (area separating nano/microfluidic channels in our design) to obtain sub-micron channel dimensions. Many test structures were designed on the photomask to optimize during the fabrication process with combinations of differently sized channels with differently sized spacing pitches ranging from 300 nm to 300 µm dimensions.

But we were able to obtain channel structure in sub-micron scale directly by optimizing multiple steps of the fabrication process.

40|$|The aim is {{to study}} the {{structural}} and dynamic characteristics of the water-polymer jet, what is of decisive importance for understanding {{the nature of the}} abnormally high cutting ability. A complex study of the structure and dynamics of a water-polymer high-speed jet has been carried out. Analysis of the photographs of jets of aqueous PEO solution indicates that adding polyethylene oxide (PEO) into water results in {{a significant increase in the}} initial sections of the water-polymer jet, which characterizes the quality of its formation, and leads to compactness due to a reduction of its diameter. The obtained experimental data made it possible to propose a relationship for determining the dimensionless value of the initial sections of jets of aqueous PEO solutions of different concentration and molecular mass of PEO, taking into account the real parameters of the jet forming head. Investigation of changes in the energy capabilities of water-polymer jets, which were estimated by the force of the jet impact on the steel obstacle, made it possible to establish the features of their dynamics. The obtained experimental data explain the nature of the change in the cutting properties of the water-polymer jet as a function of the distance between the surface of the material that is being cut and the cut of the nozzle. If the distance from the nozzle to the surface of the material is less than the size of the initial sections of the water-polymer jet, an increase in the diameter of the nozzle <b>outlet</b> <b>hole</b> will lead to a reduction in the depth of the cut. If, however, the distance from the nozzle to the surface of the material approaches or exceeds the size of the main part of the water-polymer jet, then the depth of the cut will increase with increasing diameter of the nozzle at a constant pressure.

40|$|Micro {{whistles}} are devices {{inspired by}} flue-type instruments, and consist basically of a tube with an inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>hole.</b> When air is blown through the inlet hole, the micro whistle emits a tone with an approximately defined frequency. This frequency {{is a function}} of the air pressure supplied, and its nominal value is determined by the geometry of the whistle. Micro whistles can be used as remote controls, if two or more of them with different nominal frequencies are actuated simultaneously. The air is pushed through the whistles by simple pushbuttons that are manually actuated. This allows a battery-free remote control, since micro whistles can be entirely manufactured from plastic. The lower limit of the range of available frequencies is set by the upper threshold of the human hearing range, approximately 20 kHz. The upper limit is limited mainly by the frequency response of the employed microphone. The dependence of the emitted frequency on the air pressure supplied poses then a problem for remote controlling applications. The more sensible the frequency is on air pressure variations, the less different nominal frequencies can be distinguished within this range. Work has been done to study how different geometric parameters of the whistles influence this relation, seeking to reduce the sensibility of the frequency with the air pressure supplied. Moreover, different types of pushbuttons have been developed, in order to supply air pressure as constant as possible and independent on the actuation force. A method for the production of micro whistles is ultrasonic hot embossing and welding. This method allows cheap and fast manufacturing of micro whistles, but also implies a geometric variability even when fabricated with the same set of tools. The process of fabrication has been improved by developing tools. A remote control composed of 11 different ultrasonic whistle pairs (emitters), with a recognition success of more than 94 % in 10 of the 11 emitters. The range of used frequencies was from 19 to 31 kHz, and the range of frequency variation remained below 2 kHz for all the whistles. A switch that allows emitting different encoded acoustic signals with one single pushbutton is presented; besides, it has been investigated how a parabolic mirror attached to an ultrasonic emitter composed of two micro whistles can collimate the emitted sound. This allows actuating different receivers with a single emitter. It has been shown that it is possible to locate micro whistles by measuring the time difference of arrival (Δt) of the emitted sound at different receivers. The location in the plane of a single whistle was measured using 4 microphones within a region of 2 × 2 m 2 with an accuracy of less than 20 mm. Besides, it has been found that the calculation of Δt is more precise for emitters with two whistles...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, sub- 10 µm fluidic {{systems with}} {{integrated}} electrodes for pumping and sensing in nanotechnology applications were developed and analyzed. This work {{contributes to the}} development of the scanning ion pipette (SIP), a tool to investigate surface changes on the nanometer scale induced by locally administering chemically or bio-active solutions. For this purpose, the already existing technology of a micropipette integrated into a scanning force microscope (SFM) -chip was enhanced by the use of electrodes for on-chip electrochemical sensing and electroosmotic (EO) pumping. The integration of an EO pump offered the possibility of storing, selecting and dispensing multiple different liquids with the SIP chip. For a high density and convenient electronic integration, an EO pump with a small footprint (less than 100 µm × 100 µm) and low actuation voltage (less than 10 V) had to be developed. The thesis starts with a detailed analysis of the microfabrication process to build the SIP’s network of capillaries, the freestanding cantilever and the tip. The fabrication was based on standard micromachining, from well established MEMS processes. The main innovation, previously developed by Hug et al., was to outline the capillaries of the fluidic system, the cantilever and the tip in one wafer, and fabricating the fluidic through wafer connections and the SIP chip outline in another wafer. By bonding the two wafers together, the former trenches were capped and by a subsequent high temperature oxidation, the hydrophilic silicon dioxide (SiO 2) capillaries were formed. Afterwards, the buried fluidic system and the cantilever were released, providing optical access to the capillaries. Finally, the <b>outlet</b> <b>hole</b> was drilled next to the tip apex with a focussed ion beam. This SIP fabrication process was highly versatile with regards to the capillary geometry, allowing the design of a complex capillary geometry for a multifunctional microfluidic system. To obtain a first experience with these small capillary dimensions, the integration of an evaporation based micropump into the SIP was investigated. Its actuation did not require any electrodes and hence, it could be directly implemented into the SIP fabrication process, without any additional fabrications steps. The working principle of an evaporation based micropump is as follows: The hydrophilic capillaries of the SIP were spontaneously filled with a water based solution. Once the fluid reached the capillary outlet inside, it started evaporating. The capillary pressure kept the outlet of the capillaries wetted, and thereby, automatically replaced the evaporation loss by drawing additional water through the capillaries. This resulted in a unidirectional pump, which could be controlled by the temperature at the evaporation area. The evaporation induced flowrate was experimentally determined to range from 7 pl·s- 1 at 23 ° C up to 53 pl·s- 1 at 65 ° C depending exponentially on the temperature. A more advanced bidirectional EO pump with platinum (Pt) electrodes, based on a simplified fabrication process, resulting in comparable SIP capillary dimensions, was experimentally analyzed and modelled. The current-coupling between the Pt electrodes and the solution required a SIP specific on-chip design to ventilate the emerging electrolyzed gases. This was achieved by integrating the electrodes into a novel liquid-gas (LG) separator. The LG-separator separated the gas bubbles from the liquid and guided them away from the EO pump. Its operation principle is solely based on the LG-separator’s geometry of tapered sidewalls, taking advantage of the high capillary pressure occurring at the bubble’s liquid gas interfaces at this small scale. The LG-separator was experimentally analyzed and modelled. In the experimental analysis, the maximum backpressure of the LG-separator was determined to be 0. 6 kPa. It was able to reliably separate and ventilate an emerging gas flow of 2 pl·s- 1. For a deeper understanding, the development and the propagation of the bubble within the LG-separator was analytically described in three dimensions. The model and the derived design guidelines show that Pt electrodes, combined with the LG-separator, open an interesting new field for complex high density electrohydrodynamic and electrochemical microfluidic applications. A microfluidic system, containing two LG-separators sandwiching an EO pump, was also analyzed and modelled. The EO pump achieved a flow rate of 50 pl·s- 1 at a low actuation voltage of 5 V. The developed corresponding model of the flows within the fluidic system was in good agreement with the measured values. According to the model, an EO pump with a high backpressure (3. 6 kPa·V- 1) enabling a high dispensing flowrate of 1. 5 pl·V- 1 ·s- 1 (corresponding to a SIP immersed in water, <b>outlet</b> <b>hole</b> radius of 100 nm) can be built. The performance and integration of a second type of electrodes, based on silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl), into the SIP was investigated. These electrodes had the outstanding advantage that during electrode actuation the electrochemical reaction continued to transform Ag into AgCl and vice versa, rather than electrolyzing the liquid. Moreover, these electrodes could be integrated in a post SIP capillary fabrication step, circumventing electrode instability caused by the high temperature oxidation step to form the SiO 2 of the capillary sidewalls. The general processflow to integrate the Ag/AgCl electrodes into the fabricated SIP capillary fabrication step was: The adhesion of the Ag electrode to the SiO 2 capillary sidewall was improved by using an intermediate polymeric layer consisting of 3 -mercaptopropylmethyldimethoxy silane (MPS). This silanization step turned out to be essential for reliably stable Ag electrodes in a capillary dimension of less than 10 µm, since the strong capillary force tended to delaminate the electrode. Crucial for a successful silanization was the use of a gas phase deposition on a dehydrated surface, to avoid the formation of polymeric MPS globuly. Electroless deposition provided a highly flexible and unique tool to deposit the electrodes in the closed SIP capillaries. The general idea was to fill a solution of Ag ions, as well as a reducing agent into the capillary. During the electrochemical reaction, the Ag electrodes started to grow on the capillary sidewall. The deposition of thick electrodes was required since during the electrode actuation, either Ag or AgCl was continuously consumed. This deposition of thick electrodes was especially challenging due to a minute available capillary volume, hence high concentrations within the electroless solution were used. The best electroless deposition process control was achieved with an improved Tollens solution and the reaction speed was controlled with the sodium citrate concentration (decrease) and the sodium hydroxide concentration (increase). Two different methods of electroless deposition were employed: First, a batch-like dip process of multiple electroless depositions, and second, a single electrode flow deposition process providing continuously fresh electroless solution. The electrode structuring was performed by controlling the capillary filling of the electroless solution within the fluidic system by microfluidic stopvalves. The stopvalve functionality was twofold, the solution was reliably stopped during the electroless deposition and afterwards the stopvalve was void free filled to ensure correct fluidic actuation of the final device. This should be done preferably without applying any external pressure. The switching from stopping to transmitting the solution was induced by a change in the solution’s surface tension. The stopvalve performance was modelled by improving the previously two dimensional model to three dimensions including, additionally, the design fabrication specific corner rounding and low capillary cross section’s aspect ratio. After the electroless deposition and structuring, the Ag electrode was further transformed into an Ag/AgCl electrode. Similarly to the electroless Ag deposition, the electrode transformation was performed with a flow of either sodium hypochloride or ferric(III) chloride. The transformation should be limited to 20 % of the initial Ag layer thickness, due to stress related electrode delamination or cracking, originating in the density difference of Ag and AgCl. Interestingly, the electrochemical transformation process from Ag into AgCl could be described by the Deal-Grove model for the oxidation of silicon. The growth of AgCl depended nonlinearly on electrochemical reaction time. After an AgCl thickness of about 40 nm, the electrochemical reaction was dominated by the diffusion of the oxidizing species through an increasing layer of AgCl. Electrodes were deposited into three different capillaries: a) into the SIP capillary itself (cross section 2. 2 µm × 3. 7 µm), b) for larger availability and easier accessibility, into commercially available round capillaries (radius up to 520 µm), and c) a polymeric microfluidic system with rectangular capillaries (cross section 55 µm × 65 µm). Inside the SIP, the functionality of the microfluidic stopvalve was experimentally verified, a binary solution of 20 % ethanol in water (contact angle 82 °) was stopped and a binary solution of 40 % ethanol in water (contact angle 58 °) filled the stopvalve void free. In addition, a successful dip electroless deposition and stopvalve structuring of Ag electrodes was shown. Inside round capillaries, multiple electroless depositions revealed that each deposition increased the Ag layer thickness of 51 nm. The deposited Ag layer had a high specific conductivity of 6 × 107 S·m- 1, indicating a high purity and density. The further transformation into Ag/AgCl provided electrodes to electrochemically measure different pH values. A linear pH sensitivity of 57. 4 mV·pH- 1 at 22. 7 ° C with a good agreement of Nernstian behavior was reached. During these experiments, it turned out that the electroless Ag deposition was highly contamination sensitive which was strongly enhanced by the small capillary cross section. Therefore, the deposition into the polymeric fluidic system was performed with a flow of electroless solution instead of previously used multiple depositions. Despite the individual electrode deposition, the flow deposition had the advantage that the concentration could be kept constant throughout the capillary during the complete deposition time. This provided a better reaction control due to a lower concentration and in addition, it reduced the effect of the minute available capillary volume. The EO pump inside the polymeric fluidic system had an experimentally determined pump rate of 0. 12 nl·s- 1 ·V- 1. First, experiments with the SIP for imaging and dispensing were performed. In order to get a first hand-on experience, a less delicate sample, in less challenging conditions, was chosen, then anticipated for the expected SIP imaging of a living cell. The imaging capabilities were illustrated by imaging in tapping mode a fixed and dried Escherichia Coli bacteria. The obtained images had a reasonable image quality and resolution. Moreover, no special skills in handling the SFM were required, since it did not perform differently with a mounted SIP than with a mounted standard commercially available SFM. In case of dispensing, with an externally applied pressure, the development of a bubble at the <b>outlet</b> <b>hole</b> of the tip was observed. With the currently used method of gluing the SIP to the SFM holder, no satisfying and reliable mounting was achieved. The main reasons of failure were leakage afflicted sealing between the SIP and the SFM holder, contamination of the SIP capillaries and finally breaking of the SIP cantilever during the complex and lengthy mounting procedure. This, again, shows the necessity of improving SIP techniques towards autonomous on-chip fluid handling. PMEMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of the}} {{integrated}} receiver in condensers for common automotive air conditioning - A/C - systems is widespread, because of its thermodynamic and operational advantages.

40|$|Heat {{extraction}} from a penny-shaped crack having both inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>holes</b> is investigated analytically {{by considering}} the hydraulic and thermal growth of the crack when fluid is injected at a constant flow rate. The rock mass {{is assumed to be}} infinitely extended, homogeneous, and isotropic. The equations for fluid flow are derived and solved to determine the flow pattern in the crack. Temperature distributions in both rock and fluid are also determined. The crack width change due to thermal contraction and the corresponding flow rate increase are discussed. Some numerical calculations of outlet temperature, thermal power extraction, and crack opening displacement due to thermal contraction of rocks are presented for cracks after they attain stationary states for given inlet flow rate and outlet suction pressure. The present paper is a further development of the previous works of Bodvarsson (1969), Gringarten et al. (1975), Lowell (1976), Harlow and Pracht (1972), McFarland (1975), among others, and considers the two-dimensional rather than the one-dimensional crack. Furthermore, the crack radius and width are quantities to be determined rather than given a priori. 11 refs., 1 tab., 5 figs...|$|R
40|$|The {{different}} {{locations of the}} equipment in urban distribution substations (DSSs) {{and the location of}} inlet <b>holes</b> and <b>outlet</b> <b>holes</b> usually result in different ventilation effect, which means the power consumed by any ventilating devices present is different. In this paper the temperature field distribution in an urban distribution substation with {{different locations}} of the equipment in the substation was calculated first, then factors influencing the temperature field distribution were investigated, and the influence of the different factors was analyzed. When the distance between the apparatus and walls exceeds 3 m, the change of the temperature in the DSS is very small. Therefore considering the floor area of the DSS, 3 m is the best value of the distance between the apparatus. With the change of the environment temperature or the velocity of the ventilation fans, the maximum temperature in the DSS or apparatus will change. Hence an energy saving ventilation strategy is proposed in the paper, and an intelligent cooling control system is developed, which can modify the velocity of the ventilation fans according to the environment temperature, and thus realize energy savings...|$|R
