5|$|On February 8, 2008, Van der Sloot {{met with}} Aruban {{investigators}} in the Netherlands and denied {{that what he}} said <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> was true, stating that he was {{under the influence of}} marijuana at the time. Van der Sloot indicated that he still maintains that he left Holloway behind on the beach.|$|E
5|$|The Aruban prosecutor's office {{attempted}} {{to obtain an}} arrest warrant for Van der Sloot based on the tapes; however, a judge denied the request. The prosecutor appealed the denial, but the appeal failed on February 14, 2008. The appeals {{court held that the}} statements <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> were inconsistent with evidence in the case and were insufficient to hold Van der Sloot.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{ends with}} Walter {{watching}} {{a video of}} Olivia as a child, apparently taken while she was being administered Cortexiphan. Walter's voice is heard <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> as is William Bell's. Both are trying to calm little Olivia while she sits, huddled amidst a debris-strewn room of equipment. It becomes clear Olivia has caused this chaos in Walter and Bell's lab, presumably with her Cortexiphan-induced abilities.|$|E
50|$|Bob Shairp {{is being}} {{recorded}} for test purposes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> {{when there is}} an accident and the chair he is sitting in explodes, destroying his body. Only from <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> can he be resurrected.|$|R
50|$|In December 2001, Canadian {{authorities}} {{determined that}} there was no possible future use of the videotapes. The six videotapes depicting the torture and rape of Bernardo's and Homolka's victims were destroyed. The disposition of <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> of Homolka watching and commenting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> remains sealed.|$|R
50|$|A FST {{will read}} {{a set of}} strings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> input <b>tape</b> and generates a set of {{relations}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> output <b>tape.</b> An FST {{can be thought of}} as a translator or relater between strings in a set.|$|R
5|$|Black convinces Birckenbeuhl {{to confess}} {{publicly}} to the hit-and-run, {{in order to}} have his son returned. Birckenbeuhl does so, but continues to maintain his innocence in private. Charlie is not returned, however; instead, a cassette is sent to Birckenbuehl by the killer, who explains that since Birckenbeuhl took a life, one must be taken from him in return. Black is able to deduce from the background noise <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> that Charlie is being held near the local high school's swimming pool. The boy is rescued, and killer—Edward Petey—is found and arrested. However, the elder Birckenbeuhl is found hanged in his bedroom, driven to suicide by his guilt.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Ben tells Jack {{that they}} had a perfect plan to convince Jack to operate on Ben's spine, but it failed when Jack saw the X-rays. Afterwards, Juliet brings to Jack's cell a movie, which consists of Juliet speaking through cue cards. As Juliet discusses how the surgery will proceed, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> she tells Jack that Ben is a liar and very dangerous, and thus the surgery should be intentionally botched to kill Ben, and that she will protect Jack if he does so.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{analysis}} of an audio tape {{recording of the}} shooting made by freelance reporter Stanislaw Pruszynski appeared to indicate, according to forensic expert Philip Van Praag, that thirteen shots were fired, even though Sirhan's gun held only eight rounds. Van Praag states that the recording also reveals at least two cases where the timing between shots was shorter than physically possible. The presence of more than eight shots <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> was corroborated by forensic audio specialists Wes Dooley and Paul Pegas of Audio Engineering Associates in Pasadena, California, forensic audio and ballistics expert Eddy B. Brixen in Copenhagen, Denmark, and audio specialist Phil Spencer Whitehead of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia. Some other acoustic experts, however, have stated that no more than eight shots were recorded on the audio tape.|$|E
50|$|Clay {{listens to}} <b>the</b> first <b>tape,</b> <b>on</b> which Hannah narrates {{the events that}} led to her suicide. She starts by sharing the story of her first kiss with Justin Foley, a boy she met at a friend's party. He later spreads a salacious rumor about their encounter, and his friend Bryce Walker {{forwards}} her private photograph from his phone to everyone at school, further embarrassing her. Meanwhile, in the present-day, Clay recalls being rude to Hannah about her leaked photograph, without having given her a chance to explain. Hannah also reveals <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first <b>tape</b> that each subsequent <b>tape</b> will reveal <b>the</b> thirteen reasons that caused her to kill herself. She also warns listeners to follow certain rules: Everyone <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> must listen to the complete set, then pass it along to the next person addressed. However, if they fail to do so, a second set of tapes, held by a friend not <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tapes,</b> will be released.|$|R
50|$|Critics of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> {{point to}} <b>the</b> {{difficulty}} of Mel'nychenko recording 500 hours of dictaphone tape unaided and undetected, {{the lack of}} material evidence of said recording equipment, and other doubts which question the authenticity and motive of the release of <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> Kuchma acknowledged in 2003 that his voice {{was one of those}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tapes,</b> but claimed <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> had been selectively edited to distort his meaning.|$|R
5000|$|RedEye {{awarded the}} mixtape three stars out of four, commenting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape's</b> {{maturity}} and versatility and praising {{the ability of}} the song 'Dead or in Prison' to let Bibby's [...] "emotion and natural charisma do the heavy lifting." ...|$|R
5|$|In Las Vegas Rachel {{falls in}} {{with a group of}} skaters who live {{together}} and play in a band, after becoming intrigued by one of the boys who wears a shirt with a cassette on it. Mr. Will finds her and pleads with her to confess to having sex with someone else so that he can return to their community. Rachel becomes romantically involved with Clyde, one of the skaters, and one night he offers to marry her, saying that together they can look for the man <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> who Rachel thinks is the father of her child. When Clyde and Rachel break into his parents' house looking for food and money, Clyde's father calls the police and Mr. Will is arrested while Rachel flees. Remembering one of her mother's bedtime stories, she impulsively follows a red Mustang and discovers that its owner, Tim, is the man who recorded the tape, and is, in fact, her biological father.|$|E

5000|$|Clay {{struggles to}} {{continue}} listening to Hannah's recordings thinking that he, despite being {{closer to her}} than <b>the</b> others <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tapes,</b> has let her down. He decides to return <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> to Tony, who tells him that he is, in fact, the subject of <b>the</b> next <b>tape.</b> Clay hesitates to listen to [...] "his" [...] tape, but eventually decides to continue.|$|R
25|$|As the player, {{you should}} {{conceive}} each state {{aiming for the}} maximum output of 1s <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> while making sure the machine will halt eventually.|$|E
25|$|The busy beaver function, Σ: N → N, {{is defined}} such that Σ(n) is the maximum {{attainable}} score (the {{maximum number of}} 1s finally <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape)</b> among all halting 2-symbol n-state Turing machines of the above-described type, when started on a blank tape.|$|E
25|$|The uncomputability of Σ(n) may {{be proved}} {{in a similar}} way. In the above proof, one must {{exchange}} the machine EvalS with EvalΣ and Clean with Increment — a simple TM, searching for a first 0 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> {{and replacing it with}} 1.|$|E
5000|$|Audio {{recordings}} {{were released}} to cassette tape in 1991 by the Änglatroll label entitled [...] "Berts dagbok". and [...] "Berts dagbok om Nadja". There are no music and songs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tapes,</b> except <b>the</b> sung opening lines [...] "Min dagbok, Berts dagbok".|$|R
50|$|On a random-access Turing machine, {{there is}} a special pointer tape of {{logarithmic}} space accepting a binary vocabulary. The Turing machine has a special state such that when <b>the</b> binary number <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pointer <b>tape</b> is 'p', <b>the</b> Turing machine will write <b>on</b> <b>the</b> working <b>tape</b> <b>the</b> pth symbol of the input.|$|R
5000|$|Nixon {{is heard}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> telling Ehrlichman in April 1973 {{that he should}} hint to Dean to [...] "stay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> reservation" [...] because {{in the end the}} only man who can grant Dean clemency and save his ability to {{practice}} law is the president.|$|R
25|$|The {{very first}} EVP {{recordings}} may have originated {{from the use}} of tape recording equipment with poorly aligned erasure and recording heads, resulting in the incomplete erasure of previous audio recordings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> This could allow a small percentage of previous content to be superimposed or mixed into a new 'silent' recording.|$|E
25|$|On September 24, 2014, ESPN {{suspended}} Simmons {{for three}} weeks for criticizing NFL commissioner Roger Goodell's handling of the Ray Rice domestic violence case.

2500|$|The affair {{became a}} major {{political}} scandal (referred to in Ukraine as the [...] "Cassette Scandal" [...] or [...] "Tapegate"). Kuchma strongly denied Moroz's accusations and threatened a libel suit, blaming <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> <b>on</b> foreign agents. He later acknowledged that his voice was indeed one of those <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tapes,</b> but claimed {{that they had been}} selectively edited to distort his meaning.|$|R
5000|$|The ninth person {{mentioned}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> was Clay. Hannah apologizes {{for including}} Clay, {{as he had}} not made her suicidal like the rest.

While listening to <b>the</b> <b>tapes,</b> Clay walked around town and visited the various places mentioned by Hannah.|$|R
50|$|As {{time goes}} <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> will age and slowly deteriorate, {{so it is}} likely that the best {{possible}} rips of it have already occurred and been released to fans.

25|$|According to West, he was {{originally}} {{supposed to do}} the voice of both Ren and Stimpy (and performed both characters <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> {{that was used to}} sell the show to Nickelodeon), but then Kricfalusi decided to do the voice of Ren himself once the show was sold and he had West on board as part of the selling point. However, West provided Ren's maniacal laughter when John Kricfalusi was the voice of Ren.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Duffy found a tape {{recording}} of 1978–1979 Duran Duran music {{that was in}} storage. Shortly afterwards, {{he had a chance}} meeting with Nick Rhodes. Reminiscences led to a desire to collaborate, and they ended up re-recording the music <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> They did not change any of the lyrics, and used only late-70s-era instrumentation with modern recording techniques. The result was the album Dark Circles, released under the name The Devils.|$|E
25|$|A tape {{dispenser}} holds {{a roll of}} tape and has a mechanism on one end to easily shear the tape. Dispensers vary widely based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> they dispense. Clear {{tape dispenser}}s are commonly made of plastic, and may be disposable. Other dispensers are stationary and may have sophisticated features to control tape usage and improve ergonomics. The first tape dispenser with a built-in cutting edge was invented in 1932 by John A. Borden, another 3M employee.|$|E
