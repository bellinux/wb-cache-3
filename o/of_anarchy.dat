5|$|Percy Bysshe Shelley was in Italy and did {{not hear}} of the {{massacre}} until 5 September. His poem, The Masque <b>of</b> <b>Anarchy,</b> subtitled Written on the Occasion of the Massacre at Manchester was sent for publication in the radical periodical The Examiner but because of restrictions on the radical press, was not published until 1832, {{ten years after the}} poet's death.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's cult emerged {{after the}} long period <b>of</b> <b>anarchy</b> characterizing the rule of his {{immediate}} successors. However, {{there is no evidence}} that Stephen became an object of veneration before his canonization. For instance, the first member of the royal family to be named after him, Stephen II, was born in the early 12th century.|$|E
5|$|After Congo-Léopoldville gained {{independence}} in 1960, it collapsed {{into a state}} <b>of</b> <b>anarchy</b> within a fortnight. The large Belgian population of the Congo fled from the violence into neighbouring states, including the federation. Welensky dispatched the Royal Rhodesian Air Force (RRAF) to assist in their evacuation, but was prevented by the British government from entering the Congo itself. Refugees fled by foot to Ndola in Northern Rhodesia, where RRAF planes picked them up and flew them to camps in Salisbury. More than 6,000 people were evacuated by the RRAF.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the war had}} officially ended, a state <b>of</b> <b>anarchy</b> and {{lawlessness}} pervaded in {{the first}} days following the demise of Vitellius. Order was properly restored by Mucianus in early 70 but Vespasian did not enter Rome until September of that year. In the meantime, Domitian acted as the representative of the Flavian family in the Roman Senate. He received the title of Caesar and was appointed praetor with consular power.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the state}} <b>of</b> <b>anarchy</b> being {{experienced}} by the city, Belgrano's death was largely unnoticed. The only newspaper of the time to note his death was El Despertador Teofilantrópico, written by Francisco de Paula Castañeda, {{and there was no}} government representation at his funeral. Former students of his educative institutions would arrive in the following days with obsequies, when the news started to be known. The following year the political context was less chaotic and Bernardino Rivadavia, who was minister by then, organised a massive state funeral.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the war had}} officially ended, a state <b>of</b> <b>anarchy</b> and {{lawlessness}} pervaded in {{the first}} days following the demise of Vitellius. Order was properly restored by Mucianus in early 70, who headed an interim government with Domitian as the representative of the Flavian family in the Senate. Upon receiving the tidings of his rival's defeat and death at Alexandria, the new Emperor at once forwarded supplies of urgently needed grain to Rome, along with an edict or a declaration of policy, in which he gave assurance of an entire reversal of the laws of Nero, especially those relating to treason. In early 70, Vespasian was still in Egypt however, continuing to consolidate support from the Egyptians before departing. By the end 70, he finally returned to Rome, and was properly installed as Emperor.|$|E
5|$|Baker's last {{published}} work, Right Wing, {{as well as}} his posthumous novels Testosterone and Anarchy, {{represent a}} stylistic departure in that he inserts himself into the plot as either a secondary character or the protagonist. The latter two were edited, and in the case <b>of</b> <b>Anarchy,</b> partially rewritten by his editor, Scott Brassart. Testosterone needed only minor changes, while Anarchy underwent an entire rewrite, with Brassart restructuring the plot and streamlining over 500 pages of prose and notes into a fast-paced, 250 page novel. For the reader, however, it is only Baker's voice as writer that is heard.|$|E
5|$|Don Juan Manuel de Rosas became {{governor}} of Buenos Aires after the brief period <b>of</b> <b>anarchy</b> following {{the end of}} the Cisplatine War in 1828. In theory, Rosas only held as much power as governors of the other Argentine provinces, but in reality he ruled over the entire Argentine Confederation, as the country was then known. Although {{he was one of the}} Federalists, a faction which demanded greater provincial autonomy, in practice Rosas exercised control over the other provinces and become the virtual dictator of Argentina. During his 20-year government, the country witnessed the resurgence of armed conflicts between the Unitarians (his rival political faction) and the Federalists.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} years of Muhammad's life, the Quraysh tribe he belonged to became a {{dominant}} force in western Arabia. They formed the cult association of hums, which tied members of many tribes in western Arabia to the Kaaba and reinforced the prestige of the Meccan sanctuary. To counter the effects <b>of</b> <b>anarchy,</b> Quraysh upheld the institution of sacred months during which all violence was forbidden, and it was possible to participate in pilgrimages and fairs without danger. Thus, although the association of hums was primarily religious, it also had important economic consequences for the city.|$|E
5|$|Indonesian {{independence}} was secured through {{a blend of}} both diplomacy and force. Despite their ill-discipline raising the prospect <b>of</b> <b>anarchy,</b> without youth confronting foreign and Indonesian colonial forces, Republican diplomatic efforts would have been futile. The revolution is the turning point of modern Indonesian history, and it has provided the reference point and validation for the country’s major political trends that continue to the present day. It gave impetus to communism in the country, to militant nationalism, to Sukarno's 'guided democracy', to political Islam, {{the origins of the}} Indonesian army and its role in Indonesian power, the country's constitutional arrangements, and the centralism of power in Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Love {{continued}} to work as an actress into the early 2000s, appearing in big-budget pictures such as Man on the Moon (1999) and Trapped (2002), before releasing her first solo album, America's Sweetheart, in 2004. The next few years were marked by publicity surrounding Love's legal troubles and drug addiction, {{which resulted in a}} mandatory lockdown rehabilitation sentence in 2005 while she {{was in the process of}} writing a second planned solo album. That project became Nobody's Daughter, which was released in 2010 as a Hole album but without any other members of the former lineups.

5|$|Two kingdomsVanga or Samatata, and Gaudaare {{mentioned}} in some texts to have appeared {{after the end}} of the Gupta Empire although details of their ascendancy are uncertain. The first recorded independent king of Bengal was Shashanka, who reigned in the early 7thcentury. Shashanka is often recorded in Buddhist annals as an intolerant Hindu ruler who is noted for his persecution of the Buddhists. Shashanka murdered Rajyavardhana, the Buddhist king of Thanesar, and is noted for destroying the Bodhi tree at Bodhgaya, and replacing Buddha statues with Shiva lingams. After a period <b>of</b> <b>anarchy,</b> the Pala dynasty ruled the region for four hundred years starting in the 8thcentury. It was followed by a shorter reign of the Hindu Sena dynasty.|$|E
5|$|With Andrew III's death, {{the male}} {{line of the}} House of Árpád became extinct, and a period <b>of</b> <b>anarchy</b> began. Charles Robert was crowned king with a {{provisional}} crown, but most lords and bishops refused to yield to him because they regarded him {{as a symbol of}} the Holy See's attempts to control Hungary. They elected king the twelve-year-old Wenceslaus of Bohemia, who was descended from Béla IV of Hungary in the female line. The young king could not consolidate his position because many lords, especially those who held domains in the southern region of the kingdom, continued to support Charles Robert. Wenceslaus left Hungary for Bohemia in mid-1304. After he inherited Bohemia in 1305, he abandoned his claim to Hungary in favor of Otto III, Duke of Bavaria.|$|E

40|$|The Declaration of the Conference of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties {{stresses}} the growing instability {{of the capitalist}} economy, the intensification <b>of</b> its <b>anarchy,</b> the continued aggravation of the contradictions of capitalism both on a national and international scale.

" This appraisal must be applied above all to Keynesian theory, the main trend in bourgeois political economy in the era of the general crisis of capitalism. The failure of the Keynesian program â which had set itself the impossible task <b>of</b> overcoming the <b>anarchy</b> <b>of</b> capitalist production and delivering capitalism from economic crises while preserving the capitalist social system â is one of the proofs of the profound crisis of present-day bourgeois policy and ideology. ...|$|R

5|$|According to Ammianus, a deserter {{informed}} Chnodomar that Julian had 13,000 {{men with}} him at Saverne. But this leaves {{open the possibility that}} he may have summoned more to join him for the battle. It is possible that Severus' division was additional, as it is stated that while Julian was at Saverne, Severus' men occupied a separate camp near Barbatio's army. Libanius implies that Julian had 15,000 men under his command. If this was true, the additional 2,000 may have been Severus' division. Also, Julian may have been able to call on some limitanei units to join his comitatus for the campaign. Zosimus states that on arrival in Gaul, Julian set about a major recruitment drive. This would mainly have aimed at reconstituting limitanei regiments that had largely dissolved during the years <b>of</b> <b>anarchy.</b> Julian's force may therefore have numbered somewhat more than 15,000.|$|E
5|$|Constantine IV {{used the}} peace to proceed against the {{mounting}} Bulgar menace in the Balkans, but his huge army, comprising {{all the available}} forces of the Empire, was decisively beaten, opening {{the way for the}} establishment of a Bulgar state in the northeastern Balkans. In the Muslim world, after the death of Mu'awiya in 680, the various forces of opposition within the Caliphate manifested themselves. The Caliphate's division during this Second Muslim Civil War allowed Byzantium to achieve not only peace, but also a position of predominance on its eastern frontier. Armenia and Iberia reverted for a time to Byzantine control, and Cyprus became a condominium between Byzantium and the Caliphate. The peace lasted until Justinian II (r. 685–695 and 705–711) broke it in 693, with devastating consequences: the Byzantines were defeated, Justinian was deposed and a twenty-year period <b>of</b> <b>anarchy</b> followed. Muslim incursions intensified, leading to a second Arab attempt at conquering Constantinople in 717–718, which also proved unsuccessful.|$|E
