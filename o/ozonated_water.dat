40|$|In 2001, two {{potential}} disinfection by-products (DBPs) were tentatively {{identified as}} 1 -aminoxy- 1 -chlorobutan- 2 -ol (DBP-A) and its bromo analogue (DBP-B) (Taguchi 2001). Subsequently it became clear, by consulting {{an updated version}} of the NIST database, that their mass spectra are close to those of the halohydrins 4 -chloro- 2 -methylbutan- 2 -ol and 3 -bromo- 2 -methylbutan- 2 -ol. To establish the structures of these DBPs, additional mass spectrometric experiments, including Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR), were performed on treated drinking water samples and authentic halohydrin standards. It appears that DBP-A is 3 -chloro- 2 -methylbutan- 2 -ol and that DBP-B is its bromo analogue. DBP-B has been detected in <b>ozonated</b> <b>waters</b> containing bromide. Our study also shows that these DBPs can be laboratory artefacts, generated by the reaction of residual chlorine in the sample with 2 -methyl- 2 -butene, the stabilizer in the CH 2 Cl 2 used for extraction. This was shown by experiments using CH 2 Cl 2 stabilized with deuterium labelled 2 -methyl- 2 -butene.

The results of this study show that bromate formation is favored at high pH, high initial bromide concentrations, and high ozone dosage, but low dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and ammonia levels. On the other hand, organic by-products were favored at low pH, high bromide levels, and high O- 3 /DOC ratios. In general, bromoform (CHBr 3) and aldehydes concentration first increased, then diminished, as the dosage of ozone was increased. Ammonia appears to reduce both bromate and bromoform. Additional brominated organic by-products produced via ozonation of a variety of groundwaters in this study were monobromoacetic acid (MBAA), dibromoacetic acid (DBAA), 2, 4 -dibromophenol (2, 4 -DBP), dibromoacetonitrile (DBAN). The levels of these by-products are affected by the,water quality characteristics. The background organic nitrogen (organic-N) content of the different water sources may be correlated with amounts of DBAN formed. It was also found that the characteristic of organic precursors have significant influences on brominated organic by-products formation.

In order to determine the chemical stability of polyvinylidene fluoride in the presence of dissolved ozone, we used a number of complementary analytical techniques: scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy, angle-resolved x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy, and ion sputtering for chemical characterization of the polyvinylidene fluoride pipe surface. Both qualitative and quantitative information obtained from these analyses revealed a loss of flu-orine with minor surface oxidation. This was found to be limited to several monolayers near the surface of the ozone-treated polyvinyldiene fluoride pipe. The loss of fluorine is explained via a dehydrofluorination mechanism which nor-mally initiates via free radicals produced by interaction of ozone with polyvinylidene fluoride.

40|$|In Boreal regions the raw waters contain high {{concentrations}} of natural organic matter (NOM), thus their removal in biofilters is not always effective due to the slow degradation rate of biodegradable organic carbon (BDOC). The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate the BDOC degradation rate after ozonation of humic rich dissolved organic carbon (DOC= 4 - 8 mg/L) drinking water. To measure BDOC removal kinetics a simple method was developed for this study. The organic carbon in synthetic water solution in which the only organic substance was acetate was completely removed during the first 120 minutes.

The aerobic mesophiles, molds and yeasts, total coliforms and Escherichia coli were quantified, and the presence of Salmonella spp. was assessed. For the quality evaluation, the mass loss, titratable acidity (TA), pH, soluble solids (SS), SS/TA ratio and color were analyzed. The pH of the water was verified to influenced the effectiveness of the <b>ozonated</b> <b>water</b> to control the aerobic mesophiles and molds and yeasts. The <b>ozonated</b> <b>water</b> can retard fresh mass losses and maintain the pH, soluble solids, titratable acidity, SS/TA ratio and color variables...|$|E

40|$|The use {{of proper}} surface {{preparation}} and cleaning methods for Si wafers {{prior to the}} deposition of passivation layers is essential to minimize surface recombination and realize high efficiencies (> 20 %) in crystalline Si photovoltaic cells. In this work, the influence of wafer cleaning {{on the quality of}} surface passivation achievable for boron-doped emitters was investigated, including the use of different combinations of HCl, HF, HNO 3, and <b>ozonated</b> deionized <b>water</b> (DIO 3). These different surface preparations and cleaning sequences were performed on undiffused and boron diffused n-type Cz Si wafers, followed by the deposition of either silicon nitride (SiNx) or an aluminum oxide film capped with SiNx (Al 2 O 3 /SiNx stack). Additionally, both planar and anisotropically textured wafers were used. Injection-level dependent photoconductance measurements and calibrated photoluminescence imaging were performed on symmetrical boron diffused samples based on the different cleaning processes and passivation materials described above. Additionally, non-contact corona-Kelvin measurements were used to extract the total charge and interface defect density at the Si surfaces. We found that cleaning variations strongly influence carrier lifetime for SiNx passivated Si, but the effect is less pronounced in the case of Al 2 O 3 /SiNx stacks. It was further observed that DIO 3 -last treatment resulted in higher lifetimes for the SiNx stacks. Overall, it emerged that the (DIO 3 + HF + HCl → HF → DIO 3) clean is a promising and potentially low cost cleaning sequence for the photovoltaics industry...|$|R
40|$|The {{oxidation}} {{of silicon}} using <b>ozonated,</b> deionized <b>water</b> solutions was investigated {{as a function}} of several parameters: reaction time, pH, ozone concentration, temperature; and influence of anions. The oxidation of silicon was dependent on ozone concentration especially near neutral pH. This concentration dependence disappears at concentrations greater than 15 mg/L ozone. No temperature effect was found between 20 and 50 degrees C. Lowering the DH leads to a less pronounced concentration dependence with no specific anion effect between HCl or HNO 3. The oxidation of silicon by ozonated solutions does not lead to extensive roughening of the silicon surface as shown by atomic force microscopy measurements. Various thermal oxidation models were evaluated and the Fehnler expression represents the experimental data fairly well. The overall oxidation thus follows logarithmic growth kinetics. It is proposed that ozone dissociates at the SiO 2 /liquid interface in a one-step reaction forming the oxidizing species, namely, O-. This radical diffuses through the SiO 2 layer under the influence of an electric field which develops over the oxide layer. The field-imposed drift is the limiting factor in the oxidation process. The bulk chemistry of the ozonated solutions is of no importance to the oxidation of silicon. The initial oxidation rate, defined at an oxidation time of 6 s, was dependent on the ozone concentration below 15 mg/L and leveled off above this concentration as it was limited by the field-imposed drift of the oxidation precursor.

40|$|Inadequate {{treatment}} of wastewater effluent {{is one of}} the major point sources of pollution of organic micropollutants (OMPs) into aquatic environments. Wastewater treatment plants need to be upgraded to reduce OMP contamination. Recently, the combination of pre-ozonation and granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration has been proposed as a potential OMP treatment method. The aims of this study are to examine the treatment efficiency of selected OMPs, the effects of an <b>ozonated</b> feed <b>water</b> (second clarifier effluent) on GAC adsorption, effects of ozonation on GAC bed life and to identify the dosages of ozone for the design of a pilot plant. Batch adsorption experiments were conducted. The results show that combining the two treatment methods lead to higher elimination/removal rates of the target compounds. The data obtained in the study was used to plot adsorption isotherms and breakthrough curves to investigate the effect of ozonation on GAC bed life. The study found that ozonation reduces the adsorption capacity of the GAC for the selected compounds. Increasing the ozone dosage from 0. 2 to 0. 4 gO 3 /gDOC further lowers the adsorption capacity. However, at 0. 8 gO 3 /gDOC, the adsorption capacity improves. Consequently, according to COMSOL simulations based on the LDF model, ozonation of the feed water at dosages 0. 2 and 0. 4 gO 3 /gDOC results in the breakthrough point occurring earlier than without ozonation. However, a later breakthrough point is obtained with a dosage of 0. 8 gO 3 /gDOC. This is likely due to the effect of low post-ozonation concentrations outstripping the effects of a poorer adsorption capacity. Therefore, an ozone dose of 0. 8 g/gDOC is recommended for the pilot plant while a lower dose could be examined to confirm the findings in this study. Further research is recommended to assess the behaviour of the oxidation by-products and their removal efficiency by GAC filtration...|$|R
