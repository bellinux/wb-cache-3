5|$|The {{giving of}} the first kvitel cements {{the status of a}} newly {{appointed}} Hasidic Rebbe. In Belz tradition, the first kvitel to a new Rebbe is proffered by a follower of the Ropshitz Hasidic dynasty. Thus, when Rabbi Yissachar Dov Rokeach assumed the mantle <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> <b>in</b> 1894 {{after the death of his}} father, Rabbi Yehoshua Rokeach, he was given his first kvitel by Rabbi Yissachar Dov of Bisk, a follower of the Ropshitz dynasty. Thirty-three years later, following the funeral of Rabbi Yissachar Dov Rokeach, Rokeach's son and successor, Rabbi Aharon Rokeach, received his first kvitelach from Rabbi Yissachar Dov of Bisk and two other followers of the Ropshitz dynasty.|$|E
5|$|During 1962 – 63, Bánáthy {{focused his}} research, {{using it as}} the basis of his Master's Thesis at San Jose State University. The Monterey Bay Area Council {{published}} Bánáthy's abbreviated version entitled A Design for Leadership Development in Scouting.

In August 1963, a patrol of Scouts from the San Mateo County Council and a few boys from the Circle Ten Council in Dallas attended White Stag summer camp at Camp Pico Blanco. The program was observed and evaluated by Ken Wells (national director of Research) and John Larson (staff researcher). Wells had a long history with Wood Badge, beginning as a participant in the second United States Wood Badge course in 1948. They were impressed by the program.|$|E
5|$|The {{motivations of}} the three in the infighting are not {{completely}} clear. According to Friedrich Katz, Madero, in refusing to let Navarro be killed, was motivated not only by his personal humanism but also by a need to assert his civilian authority over military leaders. It also seems that Villa was mostly concerned with {{taking care of his}} soldiers and his personal hatred for Navarro, since it was his soldiers—known as Villistas—who Navarro had earlier ordered to be bayoneted. Years later, after he fell out with Orozco, Villa wrote in his memoirs that the whole episode was a set-up by Orozco, who had been paid 50,000 pesos by Díaz's agents to get him to kill Madero. While Katz and other scholars consider this assessment extreme, it is possible that Orozco, who believed he should be the rightful leader of the revolution, was trying to provoke Villa into killing Madero. That way Madero would be out of the way, Villa would be discredited among the intellectual revolutionary circles as a common bandit and Orozco could claim the mantle <b>of</b> <b>leadership.</b> <b>In</b> the end, however, Villa kept his cool, Madero convinced common soldiers to support him and Orozco did not have the nerve to go through with it.|$|E

40|$|Policy {{makers and}} governments are {{continually}} concentrating on school improvement. Much {{of the rhetoric}} of current school improvement literature focuses {{on the idea that}} effective leadership is key to achieving sustained school improvement. This literature is usually tied up in senior and middle management levels <b>of</b> <b>leadership.</b> Little attention is given to the role <b>of</b> teacher <b>leadership</b> <b>in</b> the classroom in school improvement. Furthermore, {{there is a lack of}} understanding <b>of</b> what teacher <b>leadership</b> <b>in</b> the classroom actually looks like. Against a backdrop of organisational theory, this study aims to unravel the fabric <b>of</b> teacher <b>leadership</b> <b>in</b> the classroom and provide a conceptual model of specific characteristics needed in effective teacher leaders. Additionally, this study will reveal the voice of teachers and their understanding <b>of</b> teacher <b>leadership</b> <b>in</b> the classroom.

The academic community is a front-runner in this sense <b>of</b> redefining transformational <b>leadership</b> to suit these changes in job definition.|$|R
