Overall there were 56 editions and more than 430,000 copies sold up to Busch's death in 1908. Despite at first being ignored by critics, teachers in the 1870s described Max and Moritz as frivolous and an undesirable influence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> development of young people.|$|E

5|$|As Austen's {{works were}} {{published}} anonymously, they brought her little personal renown. They were fashionable among opinion-makers, but were rarely reviewed. Most of the reviews were short and on balance favourable, although superficial and cautious. They most often focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> {{lessons of the}} novels. Sir Walter Scott, a leading novelist of the day, contributed one anonymously. Using the review as a platform to defend the then-disreputable genre of the novel, he praised Austen's realism. The other important early review was attributed to Richard Whately in 1821. However, Whately denied having authored the review, which drew favourable comparisons between Austen and such acknowledged greats as Homer and Shakespeare, and praised the dramatic qualities of her narrative. Scott and Whately {{set the tone for}} almost all subsequent 19th-century Austen criticism.|$|E
5|$|During the Eastern Han, I Ching {{interpretation}} {{divided into}} two schools, originating {{in a dispute over}} minor differences between different editions of the received text. The first school, known as New Text criticism, was more egalitarian and eclectic, and sought to find symbolic and numerological parallels between the natural world and the hexagrams. Their commentaries provided the basis of the School of Images and Numbers. The other school, Old Text criticism, was more scholarly and hierarchical, and focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> content of the text, providing the basis for the School of Meanings and Principles. The New Text scholars distributed alternate versions of the text and freely integrated non-canonical commentaries into their work, as well as propagating alternate systems of divination such as the Taixuanjing. Most of this early commentary, such as the image and number work of Jing Fang, Yu Fan and Xun Shuang, is no longer extant. Only short fragments survive, from a Tang dynasty text called Zhou yi jijie.|$|E

25|$|Gnostics tended toward asceticism, {{especially}} in their sexual and dietary practice. In {{other areas of}} morality, Gnostics were less rigorously ascetic, and took a more moderate approach to correct behaviour. In normative early Christianity the Church administered and prescribed the correct behaviour for Christians, while in Gnosticism it was the internalised motivation that was important. Ritualistic behaviour was not important unless {{it was based on}} a personal, internal motivation.

In the contemporary global justice debate, the general issue of impartiality centers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> significance of borders and of shared citizenship.

25|$|The moral {{influence}} {{view has}} historically come {{into conflict with}} a penal substitutionary view of atonement, as the two systems propose radically different criteria of salvation and judgment. The moral influence paradigm focuses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> change of people, leading to a positive final judgment for which the criteria focuses on inner moral character. By contrast, a penal substitutionary paradigm denies the saving value of human moral change. It focuses on faith in Christ and on his death on our behalf, leading to a positive final judgment based on what Christ has done for us and our trust in that - not on any positive moral qualities that we ourselves possess.|$|E

25|$|The {{battle of}} Hatvan {{was not a}} very {{important}} victory, but its influence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> of the Hungarian troops was remarkable. The most important result of the battle was that Gáspár succeeded to make Schlik to think that he faced the whole Hungarian army, and not just its VIIth corps. Windisch-Grätz continued to be unsure about the plans and displacement of the Hungarian main army, and because of this he remained mostly incapable of stopping them to advance from two sides, towards his headquarters at Gödöllő. After the victory of Hatvan, the other, more numerous Hungarian army, consisting of three corps, won at Tápióbicske another victory, than neared to Isaszeg, where, on 6 April, the decisive battle of {{the first phase of the}} Spring Campaign took place.|$|E

25|$|The Latin {{treatise}} De institutione musica by the Roman philosopher Boethius (written c. 500) was a touchstone {{for other}} writings on music in medieval Europe. Boethius represented Classical authority on music during the Middle Ages, as the Greek writings {{on which he}} based his work were not read or translated by later Europeans until the 15th century. This treatise carefully maintains distance from {{the actual practice of}} music, focusing mostly on the mathematical proportions involved in tuning systems and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> character of particular modes. Several centuries later, treatises began to appear which dealt with the actual composition of pieces of music in the plainchant tradition. At the end of the ninth century, Hucbald worked towards more precise pitch notation for the neumes used to record plainchant.|$|E
25|$|Confucius {{believed}} that the welfare of a country depended <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> cultivation of its people, beginning from the nation's leadership. He {{believed that}} individuals could begin to cultivate an all-encompassing sense of virtue through ren, and that the most basic step to cultivating ren was devotion to one's parents and older siblings. He taught that one's individual desires {{do not need to}} be suppressed, but that people should be educated to reconcile their desires via rituals and forms of propriety, through which people could demonstrate their respect for others and their responsible roles in society. He taught that a ruler's sense of virtue was his primary prerequisite for leadership. His primary goal in educating his students was to produce ethically well-cultivated men who would carry themselves with gravity, speak correctly, and demonstrate consummate integrity in all things.|$|E
25|$|There was {{one major}} controversy, however, in Blackwell's life: Alfred Sachs, a 26 year old man from Virginia. He {{was very close}} with both Kitty Barry and Blackwell, and it was widely {{believed}} in 1876 {{that he was a}} suitor for Barry, who was 29 at the time. The reality was that Blackwell and Sachs were very close, so much so that Barry felt uncomfortable being around the two of them. Sachs was very interested in Blackwell, then 55 years old. Barry was in love with Sachs, and was mildly jealous of Blackwell. Blackwell thought that Sachs lived a life of dissipation and believed that she could reform him. In fact, the majority of her 1878 publication Counsel to Parents <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moral</b> Education of the Children was based on her conversations with Sachs. Blackwell stopped correspondence with Alfred Sachs after the publication of her book.|$|E

25|$|The unique {{contribution}} Ralya {{has made}} to the Bahá'í Faith in fiction is that her works center <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> dilemmas of modern society {{in the west and}} spiritual insights and development that reflect an understanding of the teachings of the Bahá'í Faith in response to these challenges. On the one hand she has envisioned an attainable utopia (that is, not completely perfect) with specifics based on suggestions made in writings of the Bahá'í Faith. A particularly strong analysis is made of marital fidelity vs the divine law against adultery vs intense love and friendship {{between a man and a}} woman not married, though many topics are addressed including the moral and practical need for war, sustainable economics if children and mothers are of central importance to society, attitudes of the oneness of humanity vs racism, the importance of the arts and so on.

25|$|As such, she campaigned heavily against licentiousness, {{prostitution}} and contraceptives, arguing instead for the rhythm method. She campaigned against the Contagious Diseases Acts, {{arguing that it}} was a pseudo-legalisation of prostitution. Her 1878 Counsel to Parents <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moral</b> Education of their Children was an essay on {{prostitution and}} marriage arguing against the Contagious Diseases Acts. She was conservative in all senses except that she believed women to have sexual passions equal to those of men, and that men and women were equally responsible for controlling those passions. Others of her time believed women to have little if any sexual passion, and placed the responsibility of moral policing squarely on the shoulders of the woman. The book was controversial, being rejected by 12 publishers, before being printed by Hatchard and Company. The proofs for the original edition were destroyed {{by a member of the}} publisher's board and a change of title was required for a new edition to be printed.|$|E
25|$|Jesus' {{death and}} resurrection {{underpin}} a variety of theological interpretations as to how salvation is granted to humanity. These interpretations vary widely in how much emphasis they place {{on the death of}} Jesus as compared to his words. According to the substitutionary atonement view, Jesus' death is of central importance, and Jesus willingly sacrificed himself as an act of perfect obedience as a sacrifice of love which pleased God. By contrast the moral influence theory of atonement focuses much more <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> content of Jesus' teaching, and sees Jesus' death as a martyrdom. Since the Middle Ages there has been conflict between these two views within Western Christianity. Evangelical Protestants typically hold a substitutionary view and in particular hold to the theory of penal substitution. Liberal Protestants typically reject substitutionary atonement and hold to the moral influence theory of atonement. Both views are popular within the Roman Catholic church, with the satisfaction doctrine incorporated into the idea of penance.|$|E
