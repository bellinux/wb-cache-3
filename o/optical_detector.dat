50|$|Different {{techniques}} {{exist for}} separating out the wavelengths. One {{method is to}} use a monochromator, for example a Czerny-Turner design, with an <b>optical</b> <b>detector</b> placed at the output slit. As the grating in the monochromator moves, bands of different frequencies (colors) are 'seen' by the detector, and the resulting signal can then be plotted on a display. More precise measurements (down to MHz in the optical spectrum) can be made with a scanning Fabry-Pérot interferometer along with analog or digital control electronics, which sweep the resonant frequency of an optically resonant cavity using a voltage ramp to piezoelectric motor that varies the distance between two highly reflective mirrors. A sensitive photodiode embedded in the cavity provides an intensity signal, which is plotted against the ramp voltage to produce a visual representation of the optical power spectrum.|$|E

50|$|Generally {{the goal}} of this type of sample cell is to improve {{detection}} sensitivity by increasing the total optical path length that travels through a small, constant sample volume. In principle, a longer path length results in greater detection sensitivity. Focusing mirrors must be used to redirect the beam at each reflection point, resulting in the beam being restricted to a predefined space along a controlled path until it exits the optical cavity. The output of the cell is the input of an <b>optical</b> <b>detector</b> (a specialized type of transducer), which senses specific changes in the properties of the beam that occur during interaction with the test sample. For instance, the sample may absorb energy from the beam, resulting in an attenuation of the output that is detectable by the transducer.

The presently popular and commercially used multipass cell also known and the Circular Multipass Cell are widely used in Trace gas sensing, Environmental and Industrial processes.|$|E

40|$|In many applications, an <b>optical</b> <b>detector</b> has to {{be located}} {{relative}} to mechanical reference points. One solution is to specify stringent requirements on (1) mounting the <b>optical</b> <b>detector</b> relative to the chip carrier, (2) soldering the chip carrier onto the printed circuit board (PCB), and (3) installing the PCB to the mechanical structure of the subsystem. Figure 1 shows a sketch of an <b>optical</b> <b>detector</b> mounted relative to mechanical reference with high positional accuracy. The <b>optical</b> <b>detector</b> is typically a fragile wafer that cannot be physically touched by any measurement tool. An optical coordinate measuring machine (CMM) {{can be used to}} position optical detectors relative to mechanical reference points. This approach will eliminate all requirements on positional tolerances. The only requirement is that the PCB is manufactured with oversized holes. An exaggerated sketch of this situation is shown in Figure 2. The sketch shows very loose tolerances on mounting the <b>optical</b> <b>detector</b> in the chip carrier, loose tolerance on soldering the chip carrier to the PCB, and finally large tolerance on where the mounting screws are located. The PCB is held with large screws and oversized holes. The PCB is mounted loosely so it can move freely around. The optical CMM measures the mechanical reference points. Based on these measurements, the required positions of the <b>optical</b> <b>detector</b> corners can be calculated. The optical CMM is commanded to go to the position where one detector corner is supposed to be. This is indicated with the cross-hairs in Figure 2 (a). This figure is representative of the image of the optical CMM monitor. Using a suitable tapping tool, the PCB is manually tapped around until the corner of the <b>optical</b> <b>detector</b> is at the crosshairs of the optical CMM. The CMM is commanded to another corner, and the process is repeated a number of times until all corners of the <b>optical</b> <b>detector</b> are within a distance of 10 to 30 microns of the required position. The situation is sketched in Figure 2 (b) (the figure also shows the tapping tool and where to tap). At this point the fasteners for the PCB are torqued slightly so the PCB can still move. The PCB location is adjusted again with the tapping tool. This process is repeated 3 to 4 times until the final torque is achieved. The oversized mounting holes are then filled with a liquid bonding agent to secure the board in position (not shown in the sketch). A 10 - to 30 -micron mounting accuracy has been achieved utilizing this method. ...|$|E
