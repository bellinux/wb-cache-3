5|$|The {{eleventh}} nocturne {{was written}} in memory of Noémi Lalo; her widower, Pierre Lalo, was a music critic and a friend and supporter of Fauré. Morrison suggests that its funereal effect of tolling bells may also reflect the composer's <b>own</b> <b>state</b> of anguish, with deafness encroaching. The melodic line is simple and restrained, and except for a passionate section near the end is generally quiet and elegiac.|$|E
5|$|By 1940, Jinnah {{had come}} to believe that Muslims of the Indian subcontinent should have their <b>own</b> <b>state.</b> In that year, the Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, {{demanding}} a separate nation. During the Second World War, the League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were imprisoned, and in the elections held shortly after the war, it won most of the seats reserved for Muslims. Ultimately, the Congress and the Muslim League could not reach a power-sharing formula for the subcontinent to be united as a single state, leading all parties to agree to the independence of a predominantly Hindu India, and for a Muslim-majority state of Pakistan.|$|E

5|$|Law professors (and brothers) Akhil Reed Amar and Vikram Amar {{defended the}} {{constitutionality}} of such a plan.

This paper critically examines: whose values matter; why {{there is a difference between}} own and hypothetical values; how to measure <b>own</b> health <b>state</b> values; and why to use <b>own</b> health <b>state</b> values. Finally, the paper also examines other ways that <b>own</b> health <b>state</b> values can be taken into account, such as including the use of informed general population preferences that may better take into account experience-based values...|$|R

5|$|The Ising {{model is}} used to model the {{behavior}} of magnetic systems. It consists of an array of cells, the state of each of which represents a spin, either up or down. The energy {{of the system is}} measured by a function that depends on the number of neighboring pairs of cells that have the same spin as each other. Therefore, if a cell has equal numbers of neighbors in the two states, it may flip its <b>own</b> <b>state</b> without changing the total energy. However, such a flip is energy-conserving only if no two adjacent cells flip at the same time.|$|E
5|$|While {{the central}} Song court {{remained}} politically divided and focused upon its internal affairs, alarming new events {{to the north}} in the Liao state finally came to its attention. The Jurchen, a subject tribe of the Liao, rebelled against them and formed their <b>own</b> <b>state,</b> the Jin dynasty (1115–1234). The Song official Tong Guan (1054–1126) advised Emperor Huizong (1100–1125) to form an alliance with the Jurchens, and the joint military campaign under this Alliance Conducted at Sea toppled and completely conquered the Liao dynasty by 1125.|$|E
5|$|Before 2009, members {{received}} the same salary as members of their national parliament. However, from 2009 a new members statute came into force, after years of attempts, which gave all members an equal monthly pay, of 8,020.53 euro each in 2014, subject to a European Union tax and which can also be taxed nationally. MEPs {{are entitled to a}} pension, paid by Parliament, from the age of 63. Members are also entitled to allowances for office costs and subsistence, and travelling expenses, based on actual cost. Besides their pay, members are granted a number of privileges and immunities. To ensure their free movement to and from the Parliament, they are accorded by their own states the facilities accorded to senior officials travelling abroad and, by other state governments, the status of visiting foreign representatives. When in their <b>own</b> <b>state,</b> they have all the immunities accorded to national parliamentarians, and, in other states, they have immunity from detention and legal proceedings. However, immunity cannot be claimed when a member is found committing a criminal offence and the Parliament also has the right to strip a member of their immunity.|$|E

Prior empirical scholarship is ambiguous. We test the charge of bias using statistical methods. We find strong evidence that (1) judges favor the states that appoint them and that (2) judges favor states whose wealth level is close to that of the their <b>own</b> <b>states,</b> and weaker evidence that (3) judges favor states whose political system {{is similar to that of}} their <b>own</b> <b>states</b> and that (4) (more weakly) judges favor states whose culture (language and religion) is similar to that of their <b>own</b> <b>states.</b> We find weak or no evidence that judges are influenced by regional and military alignments. ...|$|R

5|$|Each state's presidential electors {{gathered}} in their state's capital on February 4, 1789 {{to cast their}} votes for the president. As originally prescribed by Article II of the Constitution, each state chose a number of electors equal to its representation in Congress. Each elector then cast two votes for president, though the electors {{were not allowed to}} cast both votes for the same person, and were prohibited from casting both their ballots for persons from their <b>own</b> <b>state.</b> The individual who won the most electoral votes would become president while the individual with the second-most electoral votes would become vice president. Each state's votes were sealed and delivered to Congress to be counted. Adams received 34 electoral college votes in the presidential election of 1789, finishing in second place behind George Washington, who garnered 69 votes. As a result, Washington became the nation's first president, and Adams became the its first vice president.|$|E
5|$|McGovern did not mourn {{leaving the}} Senate. Although being {{rejected}} by his <b>own</b> <b>state</b> stung, intellectually he could accept that South Dakotans wanted {{a more conservative}} representative; he and Eleanor felt {{out of touch with}} the country and in some ways liberated by the loss. Nevertheless, he refused to believe that American liberalism was dead in the time of Reagan; remaining active in politics, in January 1981 he founded the political organization Americans for Common Sense. The group sought to rally liberals, encourage liberal thinking, and combat the Moral Majority and other new Christian right forces. In 1982, he turned the group into a political action committee, which raised $1.2 million for liberal candidates in the 1982 U.S. Congressional elections. McGovern shut the committee down when he decided to run for president again.|$|E

The rights to television broadcasting belonged to Viacom18's flagship general entertainment channel Colors. The film was not released in Kom's home state of Manipur because of the ban on Bollywood films by the Imphal-based separatist militant group, Revolutionary Peoples Front (RPF) since 2000. In an interview with Press Trust of India, Kom expressed her sadness that people from her <b>own</b> <b>state</b> {{would not be able to}} see her biopic.

5|$|The finance {{ministry}} {{started the}} budget preparation process by preparing instructions, forms and schedules {{for the upcoming}} state budget and prepared a preliminary balance of revenues and expenditures using data estimated by the State Planning Committee (Gosplan).

The Union branches of the Ministry of Finance then prepared a budget estimate with information received from the lower Union ministries and information given {{to them by the}} all-Union Ministry of Finance. The state budget was conceived after the Union Ministry negotiated a compromise with its republican and local branches and each Soviet republic was given its <b>own</b> <b>state</b> budget.

25|$|This is {{also the}} reason why the zeroth law of {{thermodynamics}} is stated explicitly. If three physical systems, A, B, and C are each not in their <b>own</b> <b>states</b> of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, it is possible that, with suitable physical connections being made between them, A can heat B and B can heat C and C can heat A. In non-equilibrium situations, cycles of flow are possible. It is the special and uniquely distinguishing characteristic of internal thermodynamic equilibrium that this possibility is not open to thermodynamic systems (as distinguished amongst physical systems) which are in their <b>own</b> <b>states</b> of internal thermodynamic equilibrium; this is {{the reason why the}} zeroth law of thermodynamics needs explicit statement. That is to say, the relation 'is not colder than' between general non-equilibrium physical systems is not transitive, whereas, in contrast, the relation 'has no lower a temperature than' between thermodynamic systems in their <b>own</b> <b>states</b> of internal thermodynamic equilibrium is transitive. It follows from this that the relation 'is in thermal equilibrium with' is transitive, which is one way of stating the zeroth law.|$|R
