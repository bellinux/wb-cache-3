5|$|The {{proportion}} <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> {{volume that}} is cytosol varies: for example while this compartment forms the bulk <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> structure in bacteria, in plant cells the main compartment {{is the large}} central vacuole. The cytosol consists mostly of water, dissolved ions, small molecules, and large water-soluble molecules (such as proteins). The majority of these non-protein molecules have a molecular mass of less than 300Da. This mixture of small molecules is extraordinarily complex, as the variety of molecules {{that are involved in}} metabolism (the metabolites) is immense. For example, up to 200,000 different small molecules might be made in plants, although not all these will be present in the same species, or in a single cell. Estimates of the number of metabolites in single cells such as E. coli and baker's yeast predict that under 1,000 are made.|$|E

40|$|Three classes <b>of</b> immunologically {{reactive}} <b>cells,</b> differing {{only slightly}} {{in size from}} each other, are required for the production <b>of</b> hemolysin-forming <b>cells</b> in culture. The three classes <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> can be detected in the normal mouse spleen by the combined use of rosette formation, velocity sedimentation, and irradiation. One class <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> (peak sedimentation velocity, 3. 2 mm per hr) forms rosettes. The capacity <b>of</b> these <b>cells</b> to participate in immune responses to foreign erythrocytes is inhibited by relatively low doses <b>of</b> irradiation. These <b>cells</b> may be the immediate precursors <b>of</b> hemolysin-forming <b>cells.</b> A second class <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> (peak sedimentation velocity, 3. 6 mm per hr) facilitates the production <b>of</b> hemolysin-forming <b>cells</b> by small numbers <b>of</b> normal spleen <b>cells.</b> Their facilitative activity is resistant to a relatively large dose of radiation. They do not form rosettes. The requirement of a third class <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> was deduced {{from the results of}} mixing experiments. Neither rosette-forming cells nor spleen <b>cells</b> largely depleted <b>of</b> rosette-forming <b>cells</b> could give rise to hemolysin-forming cells when cultured either alone or in the presence of large numbers <b>of</b> heavily irradiated <b>cells.</b> However, when rosette-forming <b>cells,</b> <b>cells</b> depleted <b>of</b> rosette-forming <b>cells,</b> and heavily irradiated cells were mixed together, hemolysin-forming cells were produced. The peak responses were found in fractions sedimenting at 4 mm per hr. Thus, it is suggested that these fractions contain a third class <b>of</b> <b>cells.</b> This class <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> does not form rosettes, but its function is inhibited by relatively low doses of radiation...|$|R

5|$|The {{life cycle}} of poxviruses is {{complicated}} by having multiple infectious forms, with differing mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> entry.

40|$|Developmental {{processes}} in biology are underlined by proliferation, differentiation and migration <b>of</b> <b>cells.</b> The latter two are interlinked since cellular differentiation {{is governed by}} the dynamics of morphogens which, in turn, {{is affected by the}} movement <b>of</b> <b>cells.</b> Mutual effects <b>of</b> morphogenetic and <b>cell</b> movement patterns are enhanced when the movement is due to chemotactic response <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> to the morphogens. In this study we introduce a mathematical model to analyse how this interplay can result in a steady movement <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> in a tissue and associated formation of travelling waves in a concentration field of morphogen. Using the model we have identified four chemotactic scenarios for migration <b>of</b> single <b>cell</b> or homogeneous group <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> in a tissue. Such a migration can take place if moving cells are (1) repelled by a chemical produced by themselves or (2) attracted by a chemical produced by the surrounding cells in a tissue. Furthermore, the group <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> can also move if cells in surrounding tissue are (3) repelled by a chemical produced by moving cells or (4) attracted by a chemical produced by surrounding cells themselves. The proposed mechanisms can underlie migration <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> during embryonic development as well as spread <b>of</b> metastatic <b>cells...</b>|$|R
