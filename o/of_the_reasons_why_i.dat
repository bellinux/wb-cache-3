500|$|As a show, Torchwood {{is highly}} intertextual. The {{consequence}} {{of this is that}} many sides of Jack are shown across various media. One commentator feels that this emphasises Jack's pivotal place in the development and change of modern science fiction heroes. The character's unexpected popularity with a multitude of audiences, would later shape his appearances both as a traditional [...] "action hero" [...] and as a positive role model for younger viewers. Barrowman also remarks that [...] "The beauty of Captain Jack, and one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> think, as an actor, I've landed on my feet, is that he's popular with one audience in Torchwood and with another in Doctor Who." ...|$|E

He pitched stories for [...] on the basis that the show targeted an adult audience similar to [...] and not children. He {{knew it was going to}} be broadcast on Saturday mornings, but would be unhampered by restrictions on live-action television. He later said [...] "that was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> took it, because I'm not an animated writer... I had written a couple of animated shows through the years, and it was like pulling teeth." [...] He explained that he wrote the script for [...] "The Survivor" [...] as if it was a live-action story; it was originally known as [...] "The Chameleon". The title was eventually changed in order to preserve the plot point as a surprise for the viewer.|$|E
500|$|Following her {{departure}} from Hole in November 1999, Melissa Auf der Maur was recruited as the replacement bassist for D'arcy Wretzky in The Smashing Pumpkins in early 2000. Auf der Maur toured {{with the band}} for the Sacred and Profane tour in support of Machina/The Machines of God (2000) and appeared in the music videos accompanying its release. In May 2000, The Smashing Pumpkins disbanded and Auf der Maur did not have plans to continue her music career. In an interview with Jam!, Auf der Maur said: [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> took 2001 off is I didn't even know what I {{was going to do}} with music. Maybe I was going to play in a cover band the rest of my life" [...] and that her [...] "relationship to music had become very army-oriented. I was a soldier, a hard worker who never got enough satisfaction from the music. I didn't know if I was going to make my own record." [...] In late 2001, Auf der Maur discovered [...] "old demos" [...] in her Montréal residence and [...] "realized [...] had an entire album's worth of material that had been sitting there for years." [...] Among the demos was [...] "Real a Lie", a song written with frequent collaborator Steve Durand, that was released as a single by the duo's former band Tinker in 1994. Auf der Maur said that the decision to record an album [...] "happened very naturally." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the five}} songs she had written by for her seventh studio album, Clarkson co-wrote [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] with {{frequent}} collaborator Greg Kurstin, who produced the track. Clarkson has said about writing the song: A lot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> wrote [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] was I guess I didn't realize {{the gravity of the}} situation until I had a child of my own, and until I experienced love like I do with Brandon (Blackstock) on the daily basis. I guess you don't realize something is missing until you feel it. I can't imagine walking away from my little girl. I can't imagine not having that love anymore. I didn't know it was missing because I never had it. It was a revelation and that's why I wrote that song. I {{think a lot of people}} go through that.|$|E
