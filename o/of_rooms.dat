Combined with the system composition in the laboratory, the paper determines the control scheme of the variable air volume system, that is, indoor temperature-control, indoor positive pressure control, air distribution static pressure control, air-supply temperature control and new air volume control. The dotted lines with arrows mean the output signals from the control unit to actuator, and the solid lines with arrows represent the input signals from the actuator to the control unit. Based on systematically studying the existing control schemes at home and abroad, the paper proposes the control scheme according to the actual hardware configuration and design requirements of the system.

5|$|The fort {{with seven}} gates {{contains}} several palaces, pavilions and many temples of Hindu and Jain religions - the earliest dated to the 16th century. A major {{feature of the}} fort is the stone carving done in red and gold coloured sandstones. The interiors of the palaces are decorated and painted in traditional Rajasthani style. The Junagarh palaces have a large number <b>of</b> <b>rooms,</b> as every king built his own separate set <b>of</b> <b>rooms,</b> not wanting to live in his predecessors’ rooms. These structures were considered as “at par with those of Louis’s France or of Imperial Russia”. Several types of architectural style are discerned in the fort complex and hence it is called a true depiction of composite culture. The earliest style is of Rajput architecture, defined by Gujarati and Mughal architectural influence reflecting the association with Mughal rulers, the second type is of semi-western architecture reflecting British influence, and finally the revivalists Rajput architecture that evolved particularly during the rule of Maharaja Ganga Singh. Only the most representative of all these architectural styles are on display for visitors. Thus, the unique monuments {{on display in the}} Junagarh Fort represent sixteen successive generations of the rulers of Bikaner, starting {{from the end of the}} 16th century.|$|E
