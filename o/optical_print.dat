40|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>printing</b> holds great {{potential}} {{to enable the}} use of the vast variety of colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) in nano- and microdevices and circuits. By means of optical forces, it enables the direct assembly of NPs, one by one, onto specific positions of solid surfaces with great flexibility of pattern design and no need of previous surface patterning. However, for unclear causes {{it was not possible to}} print identical NPs closer to each other than 300 nm. Here, we show that the repulsion restricting the <b>optical</b> <b>printing</b> of close by NPs arises from light absorption by the printed NPs and subsequent local heating. By optimizing heat dissipation, it is possible to reduce the minimum separation between NPs. Using a reduced graphene oxide layer on a sapphire substrate, we demonstrate for the first time the <b>optical</b> <b>printing</b> of Au—Au NP dimers.

5000|$|... 35mm 4-Track Magnetic with Optical Track (magoptical): This type of Sensurround print was not usable as a mono <b>optical</b> <b>print.</b> Unlike {{standard}} magoptical prints, {{in which}} the optical track was a mono version of the magnetic stereo tracks, the optical track on magnetic Sensurround prints contained only the control tones. If played as a standard <b>optical</b> <b>print,</b> only the 25 Hz and 35 Hz control tones would be heard. To control the Sensurround System and its volume levels, control tones recorded on the optical track varied from −14 to −6 dB below 100% modulation and activation of the Sensurround System occurred at −16 dB. For program sounds applied to the Sensurround Horns, Track-2 (Center Front) was used, with its level and timing controlled by the 25 Hz control tone. For magnetic playback in mono, Track-2 (Center Front) could be used because Earthquake was mixed with mono dialogue, unlike most stereo films up to that time. For 4-Track equipped theaters that wanted to run Earthquake without Sensurround, the standard 12 kHz CinemaScope switching signal was recorded on Track-4 (surround). Because no noise reduction system was used on magnetic prints at the time, and due to the lower technical performance of the surround channels magnetic track, this switching system was implemented by 20th Century Fox during CinemaScope's development to reduce the hiss and system noise heard from the surround speakers. For Earthquake run in the United States, the surround speakers were disconnected and the Sensurround system was relied upon to produce all the surround sound effects; Track-4 was not used nor even connected to the Sensurround Integrator. In Europe, the surround track {{was used in the}} normal manner, being controlled by the Sensurround Integrator like the other magnetic channels.|$|E

5000|$|Even before Earthquake {{ended its}} {{theatrical}} run, MCA began {{a program to}} re-engineer the Sensurround system to enable the recording of the deep bass on a standard 35mm optical soundtrack, with no external rumble generator being required, as well as improve fidelity and the overall effect and to simplify the system. In addition, dbx Type-II noise reduction was incorporated to increase the dynamic range and reduce audible noise created by the optical process. MCA also changed the way the control tones were used, allowing the Sensurround horns {{in the front and}} back of the theater to be controlled independently. This allowed for more creative effects, such as a sound being panned from front to back of the theater. Re-engineering the system was important to MCA because there were times during dialogue sequences when the sound mixers wanted the Sensurround running but did not want the dialogue to shift {{to the back of the}} theater. Having separate control of the front and back groups of Sensurround horns allowed this. The drivers in the Sensurround horns were improved to extend their frequency response higher so they could reproduce the low notes in music, thus allowing sound mixers to incorporate music into the Sensurround system (this was used to good effect in Rollercoaster.) Advancements by RCA in optical soundtrack recording led MCA engineers to the realization that an optical track could reliably record and reproduce bass down to 10 Hz. As well, removal of the Academy equalization would allow the high frequency response to be extended upward by an additional octave. The addition of dbx Type-II noise reduction and its attendant increase in useful dynamic range created a high-fidelity sound from a conventional <b>optical</b> <b>print.</b> MCA called this re-engineering of the system [...] "Sensurround Mod-II" [...] and the market name of the system was changed from just [...] "Sensurround" [...] to the [...] "Sensurround Special Effects System".|$|E
40|$|There is a {{real need}} for methods to allow the {{measurement}} of the form and deformation of large objects. For example, for maintenance and production costs {{as well as for}} security. Even though there are many methods of measuring the form and deformation of small objects (up to 1  m 2), currently none of them are able to quickly measure larger objects (i. e. at a large number of points at the same time). Among the existing techniques, the fringe projection seem to us one of the most adequate to deal with these kinds of problems. In its classical form, this technique is very simple, since it consists of projecting equispaced rectilinear fringes on an object from one direction and of observing the scene from another with a CCD camera. The displacement of the fringes distorted by the object contains the desired shape information. The phase shifting and phase unwrapping procedures allow automatic, rapid acquisition of an <b>optical</b> <b>print</b> (called a "phase map") of the object. In the case of small objects (the classical approach), the extraction of the shape information from this <b>optical</b> <b>print</b> is quite simple. A phase map of the object as well as a phase map of a reference surface plane is acquired. Then, basically, the desired shape information is obtained by subtracting these two maps from each other. For larger objects, this approach is not possible anymore. On the one hand, such a reference surface does not exist. On the other hand, in order to measure the whole surface at once, it must be fully illuminated. This suggests the use of interferometrically generated fringes, in divergent beams, which implies that the fringes are no longer rectilinear and equispaced. For these reasons the classical approach is no longer valid. It is therefore necessary to find another method to be able to extract the object shape information from the <b>optical</b> <b>print.</b> In the frame of this work, three methods have been conceived and developed in order to extract the shape information of large objects from their <b>optical</b> <b>print.</b> The first two methods proposed here are dedicated to quasi-planar objects that are parallel to the imaging plane of the camera. These assumptions allow the simplification of the equations describing the system to "mimic" the classical approach, where the desired shape information is proportional to the difference between the measured and reference phase maps. The next step is to determine the parameters of the projection head. The first method is based on two coupled interferometers (of the Mach-Zehnder and Young's type), and the other uses least squares calculations with a small number of calibration points, aiming at minimizing the difference between the theoretical and measured phase at more than four calibration points. Finally, the desired reference phase map is artificially generated. These two techniques are simple but their application is limited only to planar object parallel to the imaging plane of the camera. In the last technique, which is based on a new approach, the system is described by the interferometric equation and the central perspective equations. Solving them simultaneously allows the determination of the coordinates (x,y,z) of all measured points from the <b>optical</b> <b>print.</b> This approach is general and offers the advantage of allowing the measurement of the shape and deformation of large objects. In addition, it also makes the system more flexible. In this report, these different techniques are presented and their feasibility is shown; examples of measurements give a first evaluation of their precision, and assess the new possibilities offered in terms of object shape and configuration of the measurement system, as well as their limitations. Finally, the three methods are compared one to another and advice for their optimization is proposed...|$|E
30|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a scalable high-performance vision system which is used in the application area of <b>optical</b> <b>print</b> inspection. The system is able to process hundreds of megabytes of image data per second coming from several high-speed/high-resolution cameras. Due to performance requirements, some functionality has been implemented on dedicated hardware based on a field programmable gate array (FPGA), which is coupled to a high-end digital signal processor (DSP). The paper discusses design considerations like partitioning of image processing algorithms between hardware and software. The main chapters focus on functionality implemented on the FPGA, including low-level image processing algorithms (flat-field correction, image pyramid generation, neighborhood operations) and advanced processing units (programmable arithmetic unit, geometry unit). Verification issues for the complex system are also addressed. The paper concludes with a summary of the FPGA resource usage and some performance results.|$|E
