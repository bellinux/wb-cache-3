5|$|A 2013 {{study found}} the {{electrical}} conductivity of Hull Creek {{to range from}} 179.50 to 679.00 micro-Siemens per centimeter, {{with an average of}} 283.45 micro-Siemens per centimeter. Only the maximum value was <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ideal range. The creek was found to be slightly alkaline, with a pH ranging from 6.82 to 8.07. The average pH of the creek was 7.60 and only the maximum value was <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ideal range. The concentration of total dissolved solids ranged from 50.00 to 490.00 milligrams per liter, with an average of 167.81 milligrams per liter. Only the maximum value was <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ideal range.|$|E

From US131 {{east to the}} eastern terminus at US23, M-32 is listed on the National Highway System (NHS), a group of highways which are determined to be important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. The exception is a portion in eastern Otsego and western Montmorency counties, between the corner of Beckett & Turtle Lake Roads, six miles (10km) east of Gaylord to the crossroads known as Big Rock, five miles (8km) west of Atlanta.|$|E

5|$|Articulographs able {{to measure}} in three {{dimensions}} use six transmitter coils organized in a spherical configuration. The transmitters are arranged so that the axis of a sensor coil is never perpendicular to more than three transmitters. Through the transmitter configuration and ability to measure in multiple dimensions, three-dimensional articulographs {{are able to make}} measurements <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> midsagittal plane. 2D articulographs require restrictive headmounts to ensure that the subject's head does not move off the plane of measurement. Because 3D articulographs are able to measure <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> midsagittal plane, a less restrictive headmount is able to be used.|$|E

5|$|Cats {{who live}} <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Clans are split into three groups. Housecats, known as 'kittypets', are often sneered at by the Clan cats for their cozy and lazy life. Occasionally a curious kittypet will wander {{into the forest}} to explore; at this point, they are chased away, but will rarely come to harm. As a result, kittypets often warn each other not to enter the forest. 'Loners' are cats who walk <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Clans, usually by themselves. Although {{regarded}} by the Clans with suspicion, they do not cause the forest cats any trouble, and so are free to wander <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> borders in peace. Similar to loners are 'rogues', who differ only because they intentionally try to cause the Clans harm. It {{is not unusual for}} a rogue to be a former Clan cat looking for revenge. For a kittypet, loner or rogue to join a Clan is rare, but not unheard of. Often, these newcomers have to prove themselves in order to be regarded with trust {{by the rest of the}} community.|$|E

5|$|Despite these {{administrative}} systems, important state {{decisions were}} still {{made by the}} emperor.

50|$|The Church-managed {{hospitals}} and cemeteries forced people to bury dead people with lime at <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> cities. <b>The</b> isolation <b>of</b> sick people in hospitals or charities at <b>the</b> <b>outsides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cities was another important measure {{to stop the}} smallpox infection. These institutions took care of patients and provided them food and medicine. During the 1797 and 1798 outbreak, they also provided inoculation and were called inoculation houses. Although inoculation was practiced, <b>the</b> miasma theory <b>of</b> disease was still believed.|$|R

5|$|Having {{failed to}} cut the French line at his first attempt, Howe reissued the order at 12:30. Once more Caesar was to lead the way, with the {{intention}} of splitting the enemy fleet in half. Captain Molloy then refused to carry out the order, signalling without cause that Caesar was unable to tack and then turning and sailing eastwards down the <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British fleet, rather than towards the enemy. This unexpected move threw the following ships into a state of confusion; Queen, coming behind Caesar, attempted to obey Howe's signal alone but was badly damaged by shot, and her captain John Hutt mortally wounded. Unable to effectively manoeuvre, Queen passed down the <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French line, firing as she went.|$|E
