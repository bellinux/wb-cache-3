A number of individuals and organizations have stated their belief that church teachings against homosexuality and the treatment of LGBT Mormons by other members and leaders has contributed to LGBT Mormon suicides.|$|E
60|$|MRS KNOX. What did I tell you? Heres {{something}} out of the common happening with a servant; and we none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> how to behave.|$|E
60|$|SECRETARY--You {{seem to be}} wise to a lot {{of stuff}} none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>knows</b> about.|$|R
60|$|We {{discovered}} that none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>knew</b> {{how to find}} him. Stroeve grew more and more distressed.|$|R
2500|$|Live {{ammunition}} and gasmasks—none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>knew,</b> none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> could have imagined... They shot into a crowd that was {{running away from}} them! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I should hope so. But we none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> {{anything}} yet. All {{your own}} money--the income, at least, coming from it--is in Sir Henry's hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish {{we could}} go to some place at a distance," [...] {{returned}} Dick. [...] "All <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> this territory pretty well. I like to visit new localities." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There are men {{who would}} call the whole thing crazy, and they'd have some reason for doing so," [...] he said. [...] "Most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> what Merril is." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Wilcox laughed. [...] "That's {{just what}} none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>knows.</b> Sometimes I {{think they are}} husband and wife--he lectures her so." ...|$|R
60|$|Again I smote for, as both <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>knew,</b> this {{business}} {{was to the}} death, and Deleroy fell down dead, smitten through the brain.|$|R
6000|$|Perhaps {{it would}} have been much better for him had he taken the parson's advice and company home. But which <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>knows</b> his fate? ...|$|R
60|$|GREGORY. Besides, {{neither of}} us could beat the other, as we neither <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> how to fight. We should only blacken each other's eyes and make fools of ourselves.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, as to that," [...] said Caius Nepos, [...] "we none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> it as yet! Dea Flavia has smiled on many, but {{up to now}} hath made no choice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope not, but I'm not certain, Sam. The Baxters are a bad lot, as all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>know,</b> and as Dan grows older he'll {{be just as}} wicked as his father, {{and maybe}} worse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know, Trot, and that's what sticks me. We're livin' in a magic country, {{but neither}} <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>knows</b> any magic an' so we can't help ourselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|JOHN [slowly {{slapping}} his knee]. I believe you've hit it, Maggie: {{to think}} that you may have been helping me all the time--and neither <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>knew</b> it! ...|$|R
60|$|You couldn't exactly {{describe}} it as a picnic, could you? But I don't suppose any <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>knew</b> it would be such a tough job as it's turned out.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm mighty glad you've {{struck it}} so rich, old man, an' that's a fact. All <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> you've been runnin' to fires pretty reg'lar; {{but we never}} b'lieved you'd really get into the Department." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If we put ’im ashore an’ ’e’s dead," [...] said old Thomas, [...] "there’ll {{be trouble}} for somebody. Better let ’im be, and if ’e’s dead, why we don’t none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> nothing about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I daresay not, my dear; I daresay not. We can none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> everything--not even latter day young ladies--but I {{suggest that}} a few hours with Fergussen's 'Handbook of Architecture' might {{enlighten}} you on the point." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Neither <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>knows</b> {{in which}} {{direction}} to start, an' when workin' more food would be needed, therefore, {{to keep alive}} {{as long as possible}} we'd better stay quiet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Sure,' he answered--'just as I told you. It was Dave Duck, all right; most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>knew</b> him. And now, you damned impostor, you'd better {{tell me who}} you are.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You couldn't exactly {{describe}} it as a picnic, could you?' answered the doctor. 'But I don't suppose any <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>knew</b> it would be such a tough job as it's turned out.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} that any man could call himself Heneage's {{particular}} friend," [...] he answered. [...] "He is exceedingly reticent about himself and his doings. He is a man whom none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> much of." ...|$|E
60|$|Well, then, Clarence Bulbul, {{because he}} has made part of the little tour that all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>know,</b> comes back and gives himself airs, forsooth, and howls {{as if he were}} just out of the great Libyan desert.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are always}} {{fighting}} one's battles Lady Firebrace; {{it is very}} kind of you. If {{it were not for}} you, we should none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> how much we are all abused," [...] replied Mr Jermyn, a young M.P.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, dash it all, this {{is clear}} madness," [...] cried Lord John. [...] "Each <b>of</b> <b>us</b> seems to <b>know</b> what {{the others did}} and none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>knows</b> what he did himself. Let's put it all {{together}} from the first. We got into a first-class smoker, that's clear, ain't it? Then we began to quarrel over friend Challenger's letter in the Times." ...|$|R
60|$|Beat after beat falls sombre and dull. The wind is unchanging, not one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>knows</b> What {{will be in}} {{the final}} lull When we find the place where this dead road goes.|$|R
5000|$|It's {{a blessing}} each <b>of</b> <b>us</b> was born; It matters {{what we do}} with our lives; What each <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>knows</b> about God is a piece of the truth; We don't have to do it alone. Laila Ibrahim, Berkeley, CA ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By going {{a little}} nearer," [...] said the Sergeant, [...] "some of us may {{recognize}} the place. Most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> the American shore {{in this part of}} the lake; and it will be something gained to learn our position." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> his name, Monsieur," [...] {{said one}} of them, [...] "and it is because he has no name, we call him the Mad Captain; {{and it is true}} enough, he has many mad ways with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, my dear; she won't scold anybody any more; {{and it will}} be {{a blessing}} for some, I must say. Everybody is always so {{considerate}} in this house, Miss Posy, that we none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> nothing about what that is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose so," [...] Wrayson assented, doubtfully. [...] "Somehow {{she seemed}} to get the upper hand <b>of</b> <b>us</b> towards the end. I think she {{suspected}} that some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>knew</b> more than we cared to tell her about--her husband's death." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is my belief," [...] he said impressively, [...] "that we none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>knew</b> {{the sort}} <b>of</b> man Mr. Weatherley was, {{or rather the}} sort of man he has become since his marriage." ...|$|R
