50|$|For the {{conventional}} control-line system, {{tension in the}} lines is required to provide control. Line tension is maintained largely by centrifugal force. To increase line tension, models may be built or adjusted in various ways. Rudder offset and thrust vectoring (tilting the engine toward the outside) yaw the model outward. The position where the lines exit the wing can compensate for the tendency of the aerodynamic drag of the lines to yaw the model inboard. Weight on the <b>outside</b> <b>wing,</b> an inside wing that is longer or has more lift than the <b>outside</b> <b>wing</b> (or even no <b>outside</b> <b>wing</b> at all) and the torque of a left rotating propeller (or flying clockwise) tend to roll the model toward the <b>outside.</b> <b>Wing</b> tip weights, propeller torque, and thrust vectoring are more effective when the model is going slowly, while rudder offset and other aerodynamic effects have more influence on a fast moving model.|$|E
50|$|Another {{problem in}} this {{maneuver}} is that higher lift from the faster moving <b>outside</b> <b>wing</b> will roll the airplane to the left (or to the right). Most pilots find holding forward right (or left) stick necessary throughout the pivot.|$|E
5000|$|When six {{played on}} the winglines, their {{positions}} were called [...] "inside wing", [...] "middle wing", and [...] "outside wing", arrayed in order away from the scrimmage.

2500|$|The {{museum is}} {{composed}} of 16 parallel vaults that are each 100 feet (30.6 m) long, 20 feet (6 m) high and 20 feet (6 m) wide (internal measurements). Intervening low channels separate the vaults. The vaults are grouped into three wings. [...] The north and south wings each have six vaults, with the western one open as a portico. [...] The central space has four vaults, with the western one open as an entry porch facing a courtyard partially enclosed by the two <b>outside</b> <b>wings.</b>|$|R

50|$|The ward {{buildings}} contained lavatories, stair, {{store and}} attendants room with fireplace in the wing {{adjacent to the}} covered way. The <b>outside</b> <b>wing</b> contained the dining room which had two fireplaces and the wing in between along the north-south axis of the building housed an 18 bed dormitory with 10 single 8'x9'cells and a stair and scullery adjacent to the dining room. The layout on the upper floors was similar {{with the exception of}} dormitories over the lavatories and dining room and an attendant's room above the scullery.|$|E
50|$|In {{a normal}} spin, the wing {{on the inside}} of the turn is stalled while the <b>outside</b> <b>wing</b> remains flying; it is {{possible}} for both wings to be stalled but the angle of attack of each wing, and consequently its lift and drag, will be different. Either situation causes the aircraft to autorotate (yaw) toward the stalled wing due to its higher drag and loss of lift. Spins are characterized by high angle of attack, an airspeed below the stall on at least one wing and a shallow descent.Recovery may require a specific and counterintuitive set of actions in order to avoid a crash.|$|E
50|$|Cameroonians {{have been}} active in {{activism}} movements in the United States. One notable example is the set of political movements in favor of Cameroon, developed in Chicago. So, in 1991, Cameroonians from that city were held in <b>outside</b> <b>wing</b> of the Social Democratic Front from Cameroon in support for political pluralism. After his success in Chicago, the SDF party eventually established several subsidiaries in other US cities. The group managed to raise funds to support the political movement of Cameroon, and lobbied the US Senate and United Nations and stops the advance of the sale of weapons {{to the government of}} Cameroon, i.e. to prevent that the sale of arms can continue exerting between this government and the US government. Soon after, another group of Cameroonians of Chicago, mainly francophone, organized a wing of the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement, driving his own campaign to support the government of Cameroon.|$|E

5000|$|Coordinated flight {{indication}} {{is obtained}} {{by using an}} inclinometer, which is recognized as the [...] "ball in a tube". An inclinometer contains a ball sealed inside a curved glass tube, which also contains a liquid {{to act as a}} damping medium. The original form of the indicator is in effect a spirit level with the tube curved in the opposite direction and a bubble replacing the ball. In some early aircraft the indicator was merely a pendulum with a dashpot for damping.The ball gives an indication of whether the aircraft is slipping, skidding or in coordinated flight. The ball's movement is caused by the force of gravity and the aircraft's centripetal acceleration. When the ball is centered {{in the middle of the}} tube, the aircraft is said to be in coordinated flight. If the ball is on the inside (wing down side) of a turn, the aircraft is slipping. And finally, when the ball is on the <b>outside</b> (<b>wing</b> up side) of the turn, the aircraft is skidding.|$|E
5000|$|During {{one such}} {{operation}} {{on the night}} of 26 April 1952 at 2220, Hobson was steaming in formation with the aircraft carrier [...] and destroyer [...] about 900 km southeast of St. John's, Newfoundland at [...] during night flight operations en route to Gibraltar. Hobson was moving at 24 knots and following the carrier 3,000 yards off her starboard quarter with Rodman following Wasp off her port quarter. Hobson's commanding officer, Lt. Comdr. William J. Tierney had been in command of the ship for 5 weeks. [...] He anticipated that Wasp, preparing to recover her aircraft at 2300, would change course to 250-260 degrees to bring the carrier into the wind, necessary for the aircraft landings. The destroyer's executive officer, Lt. William A. Hoefer was on the bridge with the conn and control of the ship when Tierney outlined a course to maneuver Hobson ahead of Wasp and then come up on the massive carrier's port quarter as the destroyer's new station. Rodman would move to the starboard quarter as her new station. Hoefer, who had been on Hobson for 16 months was immediately concerned when he saw Tierney's plan and turned the conn over to Lt. Donald Cummings, so that he could voice his opposition and belief that Tierney's maneuver would put the two ships on a collision course. Since Wasp needed to turn to port to recover aircraft, the trailing destroyer had two options, slow down and let Wasp turn, the conventional method, or cross in front of the carrier. A heated argument ensued that Hoefer lost and he strode off the bridge to the <b>outside</b> <b>wing</b> to cool off.|$|E
