50|$|This snake has a {{characteristic}} threat display. When disturbed, it flattens its body to make itself look wider, and its jaws flare outwards posteriorly, giving the normally <b>ovoid</b> <b>head</b> a triangular shape. Sometimes, it will vibrate its tail. Ultimately, it will strike, during which it {{may or may}} not use its fangs. As opposed to Orlov (1997), who stated this species is nocturnal, Zhao et al. (1981) reported it to be crepuscular, active from early March into late November.|$|E
50|$|A phaerimm has a conical {{body that}} is shaped like a windsock. The widest part, the mouth, {{is located at the}} very top of the body. Its body tapers down and ends in a barbed stinger. The top of its head resembles the body of a sea anemone, save for the center being ringed by rows of sharp teeth. The <b>ovoid</b> <b>head</b> is {{surrounded}} by four spindly arms, each four-fingered hand ending in sharp claws. When it hatches, a phaerimm is about a foot long, but it can grow to be thirty feet long in old age.|$|E
50|$|The body of {{the worker}} termite is small, white, and {{translucent}} as are the limbs. The soldier is larger and also white, but the <b>ovoid</b> <b>head,</b> the forward-pointing mandibles, the prothorax, and the front segments of the abdomen are dark brown. Two small pale spots are on the head adjacent to the antennae. On the forehead is an opening called a fontanelle which can extrude a white defensive secretion. In appearance, C. gestroi {{is very similar to}} C. formosanus, but they can be differentiated under the microscope, with the number of hairs on the head of the soldier differing in the two species.|$|E
50|$|Ptilotus macrocephalus (also green pussytails, featherheads or tall mulla mulla) is {{a native}} Australian {{perennial}} herb growing up to 50 cm high. It is found across all Australian mainland states, mainly in the drier inland areas. P. macrocephalus has green to white <b>ovoid</b> flower <b>heads.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{leaves are}} bipinnately compound, {{with one or}} two pinnae pairs, and 10-26 {{leaflets}} per pinna. The petioles are also prickly. Pedunculate (stalked) pale pink or purple flower heads arise from the leaf axils in mid summer with more and more flowers as the plant gets older. The globose to <b>ovoid</b> <b>heads</b> are 8-10 mm in diameter (excluding the stamens). On close examination, it is seen that the floret petals are red in their upper part and the filaments are pink to lavender. The fruit consists of clusters of 2-8 pods from 1-2 cm long each, these being prickly on the margins. The pods break into 2-5 segments and contain pale brown seeds some 2.5 mm long. The flowers are pollinated by the wind and insects. The seeds have hard seed coats which restrict germination.|$|R
30|$|Five {{years after}} diagnosis, hips were {{classified}} according the modified Stulberg three-group classification [16], where group A hips (Stulberg groups I and II) have a spherical head, group B hips (Stulberg group III) have an <b>ovoid</b> femoral <b>head</b> and group C hips (Stulberg groups IV and V) have a flat femoral head.|$|R
5000|$|The Plastiras type is {{an early}} example of Cycladic figurines, named after the {{cemetery}} on Paros where they were found. [...] The figures retain the violin-like shape, stance, and folded arm arrangement of their predecessors but differ in notable ways. The Plastiras type is the most naturalistic type of Cycladic figurine, marked by exaggerated proportions. An <b>ovoid</b> <b>head</b> with carved facial features, including ears, sits atop an elongated neck that typically takes up a full third of the figure's total height. [...] The legs were carved separately for their entire length, often resulting in breakages. On female figures the pubic area is demarcated by an incision and the breasts are modeled. Representations of males differ in structure, but not remarkably, possessing narrower hips and carved representations of the male sexual organs. The figures are typically small in size, usually no larger than thirty centimeters, and {{are not able to}} stand on their own, as the feet are pointed. Surviving figurines have been carved from marble, but it is suggested by some that they may also have been carved from wood.|$|E
50|$|The corolla, a {{collective}} term {{for all the}} petals of a flower, is limb and medium yellow outside and bright yellow inside for Pachypodium bicolor. The corolla is pale green at the base, medium yellow outside with 5 very pale green lines to just below the lobes. The distinguishing character of Pachypodium bicolor is that its throat or {{the inside of the}} corolla tube is white for about 3.5 cm long in the mature bud. It forms a broadly <b>ovoid</b> <b>head</b> 0.3 of the bud length in comparison, measuring at 10 by 8 mm. Obtuse at the apex, it is pubescent, hairy outside and glabrous, smooth {{on the part of the}} lobes covered in bud. The pubescent belt inside is 2 mm wide just below the insertion of the stamens. The corolla tube is infundibuliform, or more simply funnel-shaped, at 5 to 10 times as long as the calyx - the outer most layer of leaves in a flower, which are often green. The calyx is 1 to 1.46 times as long as the lobes at 2.5 to 3 cm long. The basal part of the tube is almost cylindrical at 0.18 - 0.22 of the length of the entire tube, or 3 to 4 mm long by 2 to 3 mm wide. Towards the slightly widened apex, the upper part of the tube is obconical, inversely conical, at base and almost cylindrical above measuring at 21 to 27 mm long to 8 to 12 mm wide at the mouth. The lobe at the apex of the corolla tube are obliquely obovate at 0.6 to 0.8 times as long as the tube. That measures at 1.2 to 1.5 times as long as wide, or 1.5 by 1.0 to 1.2 cm. The lobes are rounded at their individual apex.|$|E
50|$|Themes found {{throughout}} Dogon sculpture consist of figures with raised arms, superimposed bearded figures, horsemen, stools with caryatids, women with children, figures covering their faces, women grinding pearl millet, women bearing vessels on their heads, donkeys bearing cups, musicians, dogs, quadruped-shaped troughs or benches, figures bending from the waist, mirror-images, aproned figures, and standing figures (Laude, 46-52). Signs of other contacts and origins {{are evident in}} Dogon art. The Dogon people were not the first inhabitants of the cliffs of Bandiagara. Influence from Tellem art is evident in Dogon art because of its rectilinear designs (Laude, 24)!Dogon art is extremely versatile, although common stylistic characteristics - such as a tendency towards stylization - are apparent on the statues. Their art deals with the myths whose complex ensemble regulates {{the life of the}} individual. The sculptures are preserved in innumerable sites of worship, personal or family altars, altars for rain, altars to protect hunters, in market. As a general characterization of Dogon statues, one could say that they render the human body in a simplified way, reducing it to its essentials. Some are extremely elongated with emphasis on geometric forms. The subjective impression is one of immobility with a mysterious sense of a solemn gravity and serene majesty, although conveying {{at the same time a}} latent movement. Dogon sculpture recreates the hermaphroditic silhouettes of the Tellem, featuring raised arms and a thick patina made of blood and millet beer. The four Nommo couples, the mythical ancestors born of the god Amma, ornament stools, pillars or men's meeting houses, door locks, and granary doors. The primordial couple is represented sitting on a stool, the base of which depicts the earth while the upper surface represents the sky; the two are interconnected by the Nommo. The seated female figures, their hands on their abdomen, are linked to the fertility cult, incarnating the first ancestor who died in childbirth, and are the object of offerings of food and sacrifices by women who are expecting a child. Kneeling statues of protective spirits are placed at the head of the dead to absorb their spiritual strength and to be their intermediaries with the world of the dead, into which they accompany the deceased before once again being placed on the shrines of the ancestors. Horsemen are remainders of the fact that, according to myth, the horse was the first animal present on earth. The Dogon style has evolved into a kind of cubism: <b>ovoid</b> <b>head,</b> squared shoulders, tapered extremities, pointed breasts, forearms, and thighs on a parallel plane, hairdos stylized by three or four incised lines. Dogon sculptures serve as a physical medium in initiations and as an explanation of the world. They serve to transmit an understanding to the initiated, who will decipher the statue according to the level of their knowledge. Carved animal figures, such as dogs and ostriches, are placed on village foundation altars to commemorate sacrificed animals, while granary doors, stools and house posts are also adorned with figures and symbols.There are nearly eighty styles of masks, but their basic characteristic is great boldness in the use of geometric shapes, independent of the various animals they are supposed to represent. The structure of a large number of masks is based on the interplay of vertical and horizontal lines and shapes. Another large group has triangular, conic shapes. All masks have large geometric eyes and stylized features. The masks are often polychrome, but on many the color is lost; after the ceremonies they were left on the ground and quickly deteriorated because of termites and other conditions. The Dogon continue an ancient masquerading tradition, which commemorates the origin of death. According to their myths, death came into the world as a result of primeval man's transgressions against the divine order. Dama memorial ceremonies are held to accompany the dead into the ancestral realm and restore order to the universe. The performance of masqueraders - sometimes as many as 400 - at these ceremonies is considered absolutely necessary. In the case of the dama, the timing, types of masks involved, and other ritual elements are often specific to one or two villages and may not resemble those seen in locations only several kilometres distant. The masks also appear during baga-bundo rites performed by small numbers of masqueraders before the burial of a male Dogon. Dogon masks evoke the form of animals associated with their mythology, yet their significance is only understood by the highest ranking cult members whose role is to explain the meaning of each mask to a captivated audience.|$|E
40|$|Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease remains {{indefinite}} from an etiologic {{point of}} view and unforeseable in its evolution. The evolution depends on the extent of epiphyseal involvement and the age of the child. It may safely be stated that the more extensive the epiphyseal involvement, the more compromised is the prognosis. Also the older the child, the more the femoral head remoulding will be limited. Preserving articular mobility and containing the head within the depth of acetabulum constitute the mainstay of treatment aiming for a femoral head as spherical as possible upon completion of growth. At the end of growth spherical or <b>ovoid</b> <b>heads</b> will cause no or few problems, however strongly deformed femoral heads will evolve into early hip arthritis.

40|$|The {{morphology}} of confirmed projection neurons in the dorsal {{lateral geniculate nucleus}} (dLGN) of the rat {{was examined}} by filling these cells retrogradely with biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) injected into the visual cortex. BDA-labeled projection neurons varied widely in the shape and size of their cell somas, with mean cross-sectional areas ranging from 60 - 340 µm(2). Labeled projection neurons supported 7 - 55 dendrites that spanned up to 300 µm in length and formed dendritic arbors with cross-sectional areas of up to 7. 0 × 10 (4) µm(2). Primary dendrites emerged from cell somas in three broad patterns. In some dLGN projection neurons, primary dendrites arise from the cell soma at two poles spaced approximately 180 ° apart. In other projection neurons, dendrites emerge principally {{from one side of}} the cell soma, while in a third group of projection neurons primary dendrites emerge from the entire perimeter of the cell soma. Based on these three distinct patterns in the distribution of primary dendrites from cell somas, we have grouped dLGN projection neurons into three classes: bipolar cells, basket cells and radial cells, respectively. The appendages seen on dendrites also can be grouped into three classes according to differences in their structure. Short "tufted" appendages arise mainly from the distal branches of dendrites; "spine-like" appendages, fine stalks with <b>ovoid</b> <b>heads,</b> typically are seen along the middle segments of dendrites; and "grape-like" appendages, short stalks that terminate in a cluster of ovoid bulbs, appear most often along the proximal segments of secondary dendrites of neurons with medium or large cell somas.

40|$|The testes of the catfish Conorhynchus conirostris (n 67) {{from the}} São Francisco River, Minas Gerais, Brazil {{were of the}} fringed type, {{similar to those of}} some Pimelodidae. The germ, Sertoli and Leydig cells showed {{characteristics}} which are general for all vertebrates although the spermatozoa had a peculiar morphology, with an <b>ovoid</b> <b>head</b> without an acrosome, inverted U-shaped nucleus, a short midpiece and a long tail, typical of teleosts showing external fertilization. The spermatic duct and genital papilla performed a secretory function. # 2004 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles The Siluriformes form a diverse group of marine and freshwater fishes with about 2000 species (Nelson, 1994). Siluriformes have a varied testicular mor-phophysiology, with the testes being either spermatogenic only, possessing a spermatogenic cranial region and a secretory caudal region, or showing acces-sory seminal vesicles (Loir et al., 1989; Santos et al., 2001). Testicular morphology of Siluriformes is quite variable. The testes may be elongated showing digitiform projections, or fringes (most families of Siluri-formes) or may be elongated, with no fringes or projections as in Helogeneidae and Ariidae (Loir et al., 1989).

40|$|As the {{estimated}} market {{demand for the}} Agulhas sole Austroglossus pectoralis exceeds the annual catch from trawlers, this species is a potential aquaculture candidate. Broodstock conditioning and gamete preservation is part {{of research and development}} aiming at establishing a breeding protocol for a new aquaculture species. Based on a literature review of the morphology of pleuronectiform spermatozoa, this study was designed firstly, to contribute to the field of spermatozoan morphology by describing the ultrastructure of A. pectoralis spermatozoa. This was followed by an experiment to cryopreserve mature spermatozoa to provide baseline data for future studies on this and related species. The testis of A. pectoralis was a paired structure encased in a membrane, the tunica albuginea. The primary testis was located on the dorsal surface of the rib cage and the secondary testis on the ventral side. The testis was of an unrestricted spermatogonial type, based upon observations of spermatogonia along {{the entire length of the}} lobule. Mature spermatozoa of A. pectoralis had an acrosome-free <b>ovoid</b> <b>head</b> 1. 68 ± 1. 6 μm in length and 1. 7 ± 1. 6 μm in diameter, a short mid-piece of 0. 5 ± 0. 1 μm in length, containing 7 irregularly shaped mitochondria forming a ring-like structure at the base of the nucleus. The flagellae were 47. 4 ± 4. 8 μm in length, most with two plasma membrane lateral fin-like projections. However, some flagellae had either zero or three lateral fin projections. Cross-sections of the flagellae showed an axenome with a 9 + 2 microtubule configuration. The proximal and distal centriols were coaxal, situated deep within the nuclear fossa. The structure of A. pectoralis spermatozoa conformed to the type 1 ect-aquasperm, also found in externally fertilizing species. This type has been suggested to be the plesiomorphic form in Neopterigians. Finally, this study contributed to a cryopreservation protocol for A. pectoralis spermatozoa by testing the two cryoprotectants dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and glycerol. Glycerol, at a concentration of 10 %, offered better cryoprotection than DMSO. This was established using flow cytometry analysis of post-thaw nuclear membrane integrity after 64 days of storage in liquid nitrogen. The toxicity of DMSO to isolated cellular proteins may have resulted in DMSO-treated sperm having the highest percent (35. 2 % ± 3. 2 %) of non-viable cells compared with 23. 0 % ± 2. 5 % and 27. 8 % ± 3. 4 % for glycerol and the control, respectively. The presence of sucrose in the Modified Mounib Medium extender solution may explain why 45. 5 % ± 5 % of the sperm cells were potentially viable in the control treatment. Initially, the white margined sole Dagatichthys marginatus (Soleidae) was selected as the most suitable candidate for flatfish aquaculture in South Africa. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the cryogenic potential and ultrastructure of D. marginatus spermatozoa. However, due to a skewed sex ratio, there were not enough males available to study this species. A skewed sex ratio is common amongst soleids, thus, the need to develop effective cryopreservation methods and to develop an understanding of sperm morphology so that the best time for cryopreservation can be chosen. In conclusion, this first description of spermatozan morphology of A. pectoralis contributed to our understanding of soleid sperm ultrastructure. In addition, a comparison of testis appearance between fish sampled just prior to spawning season and fish with mature sperm provided information on the spawning season of this species. The findings from the cryopreservation experiment suggested that glycerol was a feasible cryoprotectant for this species when sperm was prepared under field conditions...|$|E
