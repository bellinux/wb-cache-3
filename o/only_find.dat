5|$|Due to this {{it often}} suffices to find {{representations}} of the Lie algebra. Lie algebras are much simpler objects than Lie groups to work with. Due {{to the fact that}} the Lie algebra is a finite-dimensional vector space, in the case of the Lorentz Lie algebra the dimension is , one need <b>only</b> <b>find</b> a finite number of representative matrices of the Lie algebra, one for each element of a basis of the Lie algebra as a vector space. The rest follow from extension by linearity, and the representation of the group is obtained by exponentiation.|$|E

Grant concludes that the dinosaurs have been breeding, which occurred because of their frog DNA—West African bullfrogs can change their sex in a single-sex environment, allowing the dinosaurs to do so as well, proving Malcolm right.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} coin find {{from the end}} of Roman Britain, the hoard contains all major denominations of coinage of the time, and many examples of clipped silver coinage typical of late Roman Britain. The <b>only</b> <b>find</b> from Roman Britain with a larger number of gold coins was the Eye Hoard found in 1780 or 1781, for which there are poor records. The largest single Romano-British hoard was the Cunetio Hoard, of 54,951 third-century coins, but these were debased radiates with little precious-metal content. The Frome Hoard, unearthed in Somerset in April 2010, contains 52,503 coins minted between 253 and 305, also mostly debased silver or bronze. Larger hoards of Roman coins have been found at Misrata, Libya and reputedly also at Evreux, France (100,000 coins) and Komin, Croatia (300,000 coins).|$|E

5|$|After {{a tour of}} the home, {{the girls}} leave the {{watermelon}} in a well to keep it cold. Mac later goes to retrieve the watermelon and does not return. When Fantasy goes to retrieve the watermelon from the well, she finds Mac's head, which flies in the air and bites Fantasy's buttocks before she escapes. The other girls also begin to encounter other supernatural traps throughout the house. The aunt disappears after entering the broken refrigerator, and the girls are attacked or possessed by a series of items in the house, such as Gorgeous becoming possessed after using her aunt's mirror and Sweet disappearing after being attacked by mattresses. These attacks cause the girls to try to escape the house. As soon as Gorgeous walks out the door, the rest of the girls find themselves locked in. The girls try to find the aunt to unlock the door but <b>only</b> <b>find</b> Mac's severed hand in a jar. Melody begins to play the piano to keep the girl's spirits up as the girls hear Gorgeous singing upstairs. As Prof and Kung Fu go to investigate, Melody's fingers are bitten off by the piano, and it ultimately eats her whole.|$|E
5|$|Gisele meets Pierre {{the next}} day when she is picking up a {{painting}} where he spots odd behavior in her such as writing with the wrong hand, which leads him to return to her castle to investigate further. Gisele begins growing ill from her previous experiment and calls upon Professor Julian to aid her. As he leaves, Joseph awakens in Julian's lab. Pierre triggers an alarm which has him race out the castle where he meets the disoriented Joseph. Pierre takes Joseph to the police station where he reveals he was the kidnapper of the young women but the people in the castle are the real murderers. The police arrive looking for Marguerite but <b>only</b> <b>find</b> Gisele who denies any knowledge of Joseph. Pierre and the police explore the castle without finding clues. On leaving, Gisele begins transforming back into Marguerite before their eyes prompting for an emergency search of the castle. A gun battle ensues between Professor Du Grands assistant and the police leaving the assistant and Professor Du Grand shot. This leads the police to open his grave where they find Lorette. Lorette is sent home and Inspector Chantal reveals that Giselle confessed to the crimes and died shortly after.|$|E
5|$|Only {{one species}} of Coelurus, the type species C. fragilis, is still {{recognized}} as valid today, although six other {{species have been}} named over the years. C. agilis, as discussed, was named by Marsh in 1884 for {{what turned out to}} be additional parts of the skeleton of C. fragilis. Cope's C. bauri and C. longicollis, named in 1887 from Late Triassic fossils from New Mexico, were transferred by Cope in 1889 to his new genus Coelophysis. C. daviesi was named by Richard Lydekker in 1888 for Harry Seeley's Thecospondylus daviesi, a neck vertebra from the Early Cretaceous of England, but this species was later transferred to its own genus, Thecocoelurus. C. gracilis, another Early Cretaceous species, was also named in 1888. It was coined by Marsh for what seems to be an assortment of limb remains, but Gilmore could <b>only</b> <b>find</b> a single claw when he reviewed the species in 1920. This species has been proposed as outside Coelurus since the 1920s (when Gilmore assigned it to Chirostenotes), and has been regarded as a dubious species outside of Coelurus in recent reviews. Finally, during the period when Ornitholestes was thought to be the same as Coelurus, its type species was recognized as distinct by Steel, as C. hermanni.|$|E

25|$|A new {{consciousness}} of the inequality of American women began sweeping the nation, starting with the 1963 publication of Betty Friedan's best-seller, The Feminine Mystique, which explained how many housewives felt trapped and unfulfilled, assaulted American culture for its creation {{of the notion that}} women could <b>only</b> <b>find</b> fulfillment through their roles as wives, mothers, and keepers of the home, and argued that women were just as able as men to do every type of job. In 1966 Friedan and others established the National Organization for Women, or NOW, to act for women as the NAACP did for African Americans.|$|E
25|$|Some {{aspects of}} brane physics {{have been applied}} to {{cosmology}}. For example, brane gas cosmology attempts to explain why there are three dimensions of space using topological and thermodynamic considerations. According to this idea it would be because three is {{the largest number of}} spatial dimensions where strings can generically intersect. If initially there are lots of windings of strings around compact dimensions, space could only expand to macroscopic sizes once these windings are eliminated, which requires oppositely wound strings to find each other and annihilate. But strings can <b>only</b> <b>find</b> each other to annihilate at a meaningful rate in three dimensions, so it follows that only three dimensions of space are allowed to grow large given this kind of initial configuration.|$|E
