5|$|Doro's album Fear No Evil was {{released}} in January 2009 and entered in many charts all over Europe. It was her last collaboration with guitarist Joe Taylor, who left to join Cycle of Pain. His place in the band {{was taken by the}} Dutch guitarist Bas Maas (ex-After Forever). The line-up of Pesch, Maas, Princiotta, Douglas and Dee went <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> tour for most of 2009 and 2010, reaching North and South America, Russia, China and, for the first time, Japan. Doro supported Saxon in their 2009 UK tour and Motörhead in Germany in 2010. During this prolonged time on the road, guitarist Princiotta was sometimes substituted by Robert Katrikh or by Harrison Young. Doro's band appeared at festivals all over the world, including Wacken Open Air and Metal Female Voices Fest 7 (where she dueted again with Tarja Turunen) in 2009, Hellfest in France, Bang Your Head!!! in Germany and Bloodstock Open Air in Great Britain in 2010.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Asian Wood {{was given}} an {{opportunity}} to go <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> tour. Lee quit his job as an engineer in order to be the band's drummer. Asian Wood's members moved to Hawaii to start their tour, but it was cancelled two weeks later. The promoter wanted a straight rock band without country influences. This left Lee and his family stranded in Hawaii until they could earn money for travel back home. The band reinvented itself, covering Top 40 popular songs in order to attract work. Asian Wood took on other gigs around Hawaii for 18 months before breaking up. Lee continued doing solo gigs for six months after that, before returning to the Bay Area for an engineering job with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He also worked as an independent salesperson for several small speaker companies in San Francisco.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, Nine Inch Nails {{began the}} Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series, {{in which they}} toured North America as an opening act for {{alternative}} rock artists such as Peter Murphy and The Jesus and Mary Chain. Reznor began smashing his equipment while on stage; Rockbeat interviewer Mike Gitter attributed the live band's early success in front of rock oriented audiences to this aggressive attitude. Nine Inch Nails then embarked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> tour that continued through the first Lollapalooza festival in 1991.|$|E
5|$|In Final Fantasy IV, {{the player}} {{controls}} a large {{cast of characters}} and completes quests to advance the story. Characters move and interact with people and enemies on a field map, which may represent a variety of settings, such as towers, caves, and forests. Travel between areas occurs <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> map. The player can use towns to replenish strength, buy equipment, and discover clues about their next destination. Conversely, the player fights monsters at random intervals on the world map and in dungeons. In battle, the player has the option to fight, use magic or an item, retreat, change character positions, parry, or pause. Certain characters have special abilities. The game {{was the first in}} the series to allow the player to control up to five characters in their party; previous games had limited the party to four.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2009, they {{returned}} to Black Lodge studios to record their first new material in five years, recording twelve tracks intended to be released as three EPs {{over the course of}} a year. The band's reunion tour took place in Europe, followed by the US between mid-August and early October. On April 13, 2010 the band released the first EP Simple Science on Flyover Records. Despite their reformation, obligations to other projects limited the amount of time the band could spend together. On their 2010 tour, fun. bassist Nate Harold filled in for Rob Pope, who was already committed to touring with Spoon. In 2011 while James Dewees was <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> tour with My Chemical Romance, New Amsterdams regular Dustin Kinsey filled in on keyboards.|$|E

5|$|Libia had a {{relatively}} uneventful career. Before Italy's entry into World War I, {{she was involved}} in the evacuation of Prince William, the ruler of Albania, from Durazzo in late 1914. Following Italy's declaration of war in May 1915, Libia patrolled the Otranto Barrage but did not see action. In 192122, she went <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> tour, during which she was featured in a short documentary produced by the then-unknown Frank Capra. In 1925 she was deployed to China, where she remained for nearly a decade. In 1937, the old cruiser was stricken from the naval register and sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Lyrically, All Hope Is Gone {{centers on}} themes such as anger, disaffection, obsession, {{and the music}} industry. The album name also {{features}} a more prominent focus on politics than their previous albums. Slipknot promoted All Hope Is Gone <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> tour and at the Mayhem Festival. Generally well received by critics, the album reached the top position on nine record charts worldwide, including the Billboard 200—the first Slipknot album to do so. It was certified platinum by the RIAA on August 10, 2010 for shipments in excess of 1,000,000 albums in the United States. It is the final studio album released by the band to include two longtime members: bassist and founding member Paul Gray, who {{was found dead in}} an Iowa hotel on May 24, 2010, almost two years after the release of All Hope Is Gone, and drummer Joey Jordison, who departed from the group in December 2013.|$|E

At the time WCW had a working relationship with Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA), CMLL's main rival in Mexico and thus appearing for WCW was enough for CMLL to sever ties with Jubuki. CMLL held a tournament to crown a new champion only 2 days after announcing the title being vacated, choosing four of their top female competitors for a quick four-woman tournament.|$|E
5|$|Repulse was recommissioned on 1 January 1921 {{and joined}} the Battlecruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet. In November 1923, Hood, {{accompanied}} by Repulse {{and a number of}} s of the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron, set out <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> cruise from west to east via the Panama Canal. They returned home ten months later in September 1924. Shortly after her return the ship's pair of 3-inch AA guns and her two single four-inch gun mounts were removed and replaced with four QF four-inch Mark V AA guns. The Battlecruiser Squadron visited Lisbon in February 1925 to participate in the Vasco da Gama celebrations before continuing on the Mediterranean for exercises. A squash court was added on the starboard side between the funnels for the Prince of Wales' tour of Africa and South America that lasted from March to October. Upon her return she was refitted from November 1925 to July 1926 and had a high-angle control position (HACP) added to her fore-top.|$|E

In June 1998, the group released No Sleep 'till Bedtime, a live album containing songs performed at a 1997 performance at the HiFi Bar and Ballroom in Melbourne, Australia. Century Media was not initially interested in releasing a live record, but impressed with Townsend's production, the label agreed to release it.
