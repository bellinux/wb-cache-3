5|$|Then in the 2004/2005 field season {{a team of}} 9 using a British Antarctic Survey (BAS) Twin Otter aircraft, {{equipped}} with ice penetrating radar, completed an aerial survey of PIG and its adjacent ice sheet.

5|$|According to {{a legend}} {{recorded}} in the Greek hagiography, Jovan Vladimir built the church near Elbasan. Its location, deep in a dense forest, was chosen by God, and an eagle with a shining cross on its head showed it to Vladimir. After the saint was decapitated, he brought {{his head to the}} church, and was buried inside. A group of Franks once stole the casket with his miraculous relics. The casket turned out to be extremely heavy, breaking the backs of hinnies on which the Franks carried it. They eventually put it in the Shkumbin River {{to take it to the}} sea, but the river flooded, and the casket—radiating light—went back upstream toward the church. The inhabitants <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>area</b> took it out of the water and returned it to the church in a festive procession.|$|E

5|$|According to {{historian}} John V. A. Fine, Shishman {{may have}} established his {{authority over the}} Vidin region {{as early as the}} 1270s, after the death of the previous lord <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>area,</b> Jacob Svetoslav. He was perhaps elevated to the position of despot of Vidin soon after the accession of another Bulgarian noble of Cuman origin, George Terter I (r. 1280–1292), to the Bulgarian throne in 1280. Shishman was likely a close relative, perhaps even a brother, of George Terter I.|$|E
5|$|After the {{initiation}} of Operation Rolling Thunder, the sustained aerial campaign against North Vietnam that had begun on 5 March 1965, the Barrel Roll area of operations was divided on 3 April. Barrel Roll was {{to continue in the}} northeast while the southern portion of the area, where interdiction missions against the Ho Chi Minh trail were paramount, was redesignated Tiger Hound. Command and control <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>area</b> was handed over to the American commander in Saigon, General William C. Westmoreland.|$|E
5|$|After the war {{both the}} old and new Chancellery {{buildings}} were levelled by the Soviets.

The site remained unmarked until 2006, when a small plaque with a schematic diagram was installed. Some corridors of the bunker still exist, but are sealed off from the public.|$|E

5|$|In 1804 the Lewis and Clark Expedition {{passed by}} the riverbanks where the city of Omaha would be built. Between July 30 and August 3, 1804, members of the expedition, {{including}} Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, met with Oto and Missouria tribal leaders at the Council Bluff at a point about 20miles (30km) north of present-day Omaha. Immediately south <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>area,</b> Americans built several fur trading outposts in succeeding years, including Fort Lisa in 1812; Fort Atkinson in 1819; Cabanné's Trading Post, built in 1822, and Fontenelle's Post in 1823, in what became Bellevue. There was fierce competition among fur traders until John Jacob Astor created the monopoly of the American Fur Company. The Mormons built a town called Cutler's Park {{in the area in}} 1846. While it was temporary, the settlement provided the basis for further development in the future.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 the University of Leicester Archaeological Services {{decided to}} {{excavate}} the presumed {{location of the}} abbey's kitchens, to clarify the layout <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>area</b> of the abbey. These first excavations located both {{the north and south}} walls and a 15th–16th-century brick oven, confirming that it was indeed the kitchens. The area excavated was enlarged in 2003, with the south-west corner of the building and a second oven uncovered: this corner had not been entirely robbed of stone, with two courses of sandstone remaining. The second oven was found to contain charcoal, fragments of wheat and barley, fish-bones and hazelnuts. A drain identified in the 1930s excavation was also located, and found to contain small bones, fish-scales, and the bones of rats who had formerly lived in the drain.|$|E
5|$|It grows well as {{far north}} as western coast of Scotland, {{including}} the village of Plockton. It is more common in Southern England and in Ireland where it is grown all over the island. Although not a palm, it is locally named Cornish palm, Manx palm or Torbay palm. The last name is due to its extensive use in Torbay, it being the official symbol <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>area,</b> used in tourist posters promoting South Devon as the English Riviera. It also grows in Spain, Italy and Japan. Even though the natural distribution of C.australis ranges from 34° S to 46°S, and despite its ultimately tropical origins, it also grows at about five degrees from the Arctic Circle in Masfjorden, Norway, latitude 61ºN, in a microclimate protected from arctic winds and moderated by the Gulf Stream.|$|E

5|$|The player, as Donald, ventures {{through a}} variety of side-scrolling levels. Generally, each level is divided into an {{overland}} part and a dungeon, such as the Maharajah's palace or the temple in which the Great Duck Treasure resides. Although the player may choose any order to play the overland sections, various obstacles prevent the player from entering the dungeons outside of a specific order. In addition to this, some levels provide the player with vital clues which solve puzzles needed to progress in later sections. Once Donald has completed the overland section of an area, he may leave by calling his nephews' biplane, and will return to the dungeon entrance <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>area</b> if the player chooses to return.|$|E
5|$|Montcalm, before {{agreeing to}} these terms, {{tried to make}} sure that his Indian allies {{understood}} them, and that the chiefs would undertake to restrain their men. This process was complicated by the diversity within the Indian camp, which included some warriors who spoke languages not understood by any European present. The British garrison was then evacuated from the fort to the entrenched camp, and Monro was quartered in the French camp. The Indians then entered the fort and plundered it, butchering some of the wounded and sick that the British had left behind. The French guards posted around the entrenched camp were only somewhat successful at keeping the Indians out <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>area,</b> and it took much effort to prevent plunder and scalping there. Montcalm and Monro initially planned to march the prisoners south the following morning, but after seeing the Indian bloodlust, decided to attempt the march that night. When the Indians became aware that the British were getting ready to move, a large number of them massed around the camp, causing the leaders to call off the march until morning.|$|E

50|$|Contrary to intuition, finding {{alignments}} between randomly placed {{points on}} a landscape gets progressively easier as the geographic {{area to be}} considered increases.

50|$|In 1962, {{the area}} was once again {{incorporated}} as the village of Channahon. Serious development finally began in the 1970s, as the village's proximity to two trunk line interstates resulted in both industrial growth (a Mobil oil refinery, two petrochemicals plants, a gigantic soybean oil production facility, and numerous support businesses for the freight hauling industry) and residential development. The village also saw an influx of population from eastern Kentucky {{in the wake of}} the closure <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>area's</b> coal mines.|$|R
