5000|$|<b>Oxyfedrine</b> is a {{vasodilator}} and a Î² adrenoreceptor agonist. It {{was found}} to depress the tonicity of coronary vessels, improve myocardial metabolism (so that heart can sustain hypoxia better) and also exert a positive chronotropic and inotropic effects, thereby not precipitating angina pectoris. The latter property (positive chronotropic and inotropic effects) is particularly important, because other vasodilators used in angina may be counter productive causing coronary steal phenomenon.|$|E
40|$|We have {{compared}} <b>oxyfedrine</b> 24 mg four times daily with atenolol 100 mg once {{daily in the}} relief of angina pectoris in a double-blind cross-over study; assessments were by diary cards and treadmill testing. Both <b>oxyfedrine</b> and atenolol reduced the frequency of angina by similar amounts and both produced similar improvements in treadmill performance. Side effects were infrequent and minor with both drugs. The model of action of <b>oxyfedrine</b> appears {{to be different from}} atenolol. <b>Oxyfedrine</b> allows the double product of systolic blood pressure X heart rate at peak exercise to be maintained at levels similar to those with placebo; the double product at peak exercise is significantly less with atenolol...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the effects of <b>oxyfedrine</b> in ischaemic heart disease, echocardiographic {{evaluation}} of left ventricular function was performed 2, 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes after the intravenous administration of 12 mg <b>oxyfedrine</b> in 15 patients with coronary artery disease without angiographic abnormalities of left ventricular wall motion. The following parameters were measured: heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, internal dimension in diastole (LVIDd) and in systole (LVIDs) of the left ventricule and the percentage shortening of the LVID (%LVID). There was {{a significant increase in}} %LVID (peak 10 minutes after drug administration; p less than 0. 001) indicating improved left ventricular function, associated with slight changes in pre-load (LVIDd) and in heart rate, and no variation in mean blood pressure. No abnormalities of contraction were observed after the administration of <b>oxyfedrine.</b> These results suggest that <b>oxyfedrine</b> exerts a direct positive inotropic effect of the myocardium in patients with significant coronary artery stenoses...|$|E
40|$|A drug-induced {{change in}} the fine {{morphology}} of the plasma membrane of heart muscle cells is described. Thus, in rabbits the chronic administration of <b>oxyfedrine</b> caused a marked proliferation of the plasma membrane. At {{the same time the}} mitochondria became swollen and vacuolated, and there was evidence of lysis of myofibrils. These changes are not accounted for in terms of the release of endogenous stores of catecholamines...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-six {{substituted}} N-benzamidomethyl and 3 N-(diphenylacetamido) methyl amines were prepd. by coupling I groups (R 1 = H or MeO; R 2 = H, Me MeO, EtO, PrO, or Cl; R 3 = H, MeO, or Cl) and Ph 2 CHCONHCH 2 groups, resp., to the N atom of phenylethylamine, amphetamine, phenylethanolamine, norephedrine, ephedrine, norfenefrine, and noradrenaline. Tests on {{the isolated}} guinea pig heart {{showed that the}} desired sepn. of coronary-dilating and pos. inotropic properties was not achieved {{by any of the}} compds. Six compds., including N-(3 '-methoxybenzamidomethyl) -D-norephedrine-HCl [59630 - 62 - 5], had combined pos. inotropic and coronary circulation-promoting effects; none was as active as the ref. compd., <b>oxyfedrine</b> [15687 - 41 - 9]. Five N-benzamidomethyl-beta -phenylalkanolamines, synthesized in the hope of obtaining long-acting pressor effects in vivo, showed no activity in this regard. The compds. were synthesized by reaction of Ph 2 CHCONHCH 2 Cl or the N-chloromethyl analogs of I with the catechol amines in the presence of Et 3 N as H+ acceptor...|$|E
