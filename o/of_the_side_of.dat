5|$|The {{roots of}} a tree serve to anchor {{it to the ground}} and gather water and {{nutrients}} to transfer to all parts of the tree. They are also used for reproduction, defence, survival, energy storage and many other purposes. The radicle or embryonic root is the first part of a seedling to emerge from the seed during the process of germination. This develops into a taproot which goes straight downwards. Within a few weeks lateral roots branch out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> this and grow horizontally through the upper layers of the soil. In most trees, the taproot eventually withers away and the wide-spreading laterals remain. Near the tip of the finer roots are single cell root hairs. These are in immediate contact with the soil particles and can absorb water and nutrients such as potassium in solution. The roots require oxygen to respire and only a few species such as the mangrove and the pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens) can live in permanently waterlogged soil.|$|E

25|$|Several genera, {{including}} Asian coral snakes (Calliophis), burrowing asps (Atractaspis) {{and night}} adders (Causus), are remarkable for having exceptionally long venom glands, extending along {{each side of}} the body, in some cases extending posterially as far as the heart.

25|$|The hill's scoria cones were {{erupted from}} three craters – one is intact and {{two have been}} {{breached}} by lava flows that rafted away part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the scoria cone.

25|$|The male {{dromedary}} camel has {{an organ}} called a dulla in its throat, a large, inflatable sac he extrudes {{from his mouth}} when in rut to assert dominance and attract females. It resembles a long, swollen, pink tongue hanging out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> its mouth. Camels mate by having {{both male and female}} sitting on the ground, with the male mounting from behind. The male usually ejaculates three or four times within a single mating session. Camelids are the only ungulates to mate in a sitting position.|$|E

25|$|In a {{bay window}} caboose, the crew {{monitoring}} the train {{sits in the}} middle of the car in a section of wall that projects from the side of the caboose. The windows set into these extended walls resemble architectural bay windows, so the caboose type is called a bay window caboose. This type afforded a better view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the train and eliminated the falling hazard of the cupola. It is thought to have first been used on the Akron, Canton and Youngstown Railroad in 1923, but is particularly associated with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which built all of its cabooses in this design starting from an experimental model in 1930. The bay window gained favor with many railroads because it eliminated the need for additional clearances in tunnels and overpasses.|$|E
25|$|In 1859, the pyramidologist John Taylor claimed that, in the Great Pyramid of Giza, {{the golden}} ratio is {{represented}} by the ratio of the length of the face (the slope height), inclined at an angle θ to the ground, to half the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the square base, equivalent to the secant of the angle θ. The above two lengths were about 186.4 and 115.2 meters respectively. The ratio of these lengths is the golden ratio, accurate to more digits than either of the original measurements. Similarly, Howard Vyse, according to Matila Ghyka, reported the great pyramid height 148.2 m, and half-base 116.4 m, yielding 1.6189 for the ratio of slant height to half-base, again more accurate than the data variability.|$|E
25|$|Jeff Kleiser and Kleiser-Walczak Construction Co.'s {{visual effects}} team of 40 people created {{the look of}} the Stargate. They used self-written image-creation and {{compositing}} software, as well as commercial digital packages to create the Stargate, the morphing helmets worn by Ra and the Horus guards, and the cityscape of Nagada. Footprints in the sand were often digitally removed. The creation of the wormhole, which was fully digital, {{was one of the biggest}} challenges in the making of the film. The ripples had to be digitally composited to appear accurate and realistic. Scanning lasers were lined up parallel to the gate to illustrate the amount of body that passed the surface of the Stargate plane. Afterwards, the parts of the body that had or had not yet gone through the gate (depending <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> filming) were obliterated with a digital matte - a process that removes unwanted components from an individual frame or sequence of frames. The use of computers generating a big 3D storyboard allowed Emmerich to try out different shooting angles before settling on one angle.|$|E

25|$|The 1858 OS shows two {{buildings}} on the site, very {{close to each other}} but not physically connected. One building probably being the old Laigh Chapelton Farm and the other, on the right, being the residence built for James McAlister. The photograph (Davis 1991) seems to be <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the house facing onto the road and the Chapel Hill. The 1851 OS shows formal gardens with a boundary wall, paths and a central feature, possibly a pond. The 1897 OS shows one large building with wings and extensions which appear to be porches and possibly a conservatory. By this date the formal gardens are absent, as in the 1911 OS. The ha-ha is not shown in the large scale map of 1897 OS, but appears to be present in the 1858 and the 1911 editions. No footbridge can be made out, however the OS maps have a number of errors and omissions, especially the exact outlines of buildings which are often only 'approximations'. Between 1858 and 1897 a main driveway has been constructed into the grounds from nearly opposite the Chapel Hill and a formal path with steps leads from the position of today's main entrance down to Chapelton House.|$|E

[...] For the characterization and design for Jim Hawkins, John Ripa cited James Dean as an important reference because [...] "there was a whole attitude, a posture" [...] wherein [...] "you felt the pain and the youthful innocence", and he also cited the film Braveheart because [...] "there are a lot of close-ups on characters...who are going through thought processes, just using their eyes." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{two-level}} hangar {{was built}} under the flight deck, [...] in height per level. The lower hangar was [...] long by [...] wide {{and the upper}} was [...] Each hangar could be sectioned off by electrically operated steel shutters on rollers. Her boilers were ducted {{down the side of}} the ship to exhaust either out of gratings at the rear of the flight deck or, when landing operations were in progress, out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the lower hangar at the rear of the ship. This solution proved to be very unsatisfactory as it consumed valuable space, made parts of the lower hangar unbearable and interfered with landing operations to a greater or lesser degree. Her original flying-off deck remained in place for use by small aircraft like fighters which improved launch and recovery cycle flexibility allowing the ship to simultaneously land aircraft on the main flight deck while fighters were taking off on the lower deck or to speedily fly off her aircraft from both decks. Doors at the forward end of the upper hangar opened onto the lower flying deck. Like Argus, Furious was flush-decked and lacked an island superstructure to minimise any turbulence over the flight deck; instead she had a navigating position at the leading edge of the flight deck, starboard, and was provided with a retractable charthouse forward, on the flight deck centreline. The ship could normally only carry about 36 aircraft.|$|E
500|$|Mount Rainier {{is located}} {{in an area that}} itself is part of the eastern rim of the Pacific Ring of Fire.

[...] All of the above are dormant, but alive, and scientists {{on both sides of the}} border gather research of the past eruptions of each in order to predict how mountains in this arc will behave and what they are capable of in the future, including Mount Rainier. Of these, only two have erupted since the beginning of the twentieth century: Lassen in 1915 and St. Helens in 1980 and 2004. [...] However, past eruptions in this volcanic arc have multiple examples of sub-plinian eruptions [...] or higher: Crater Lake's last eruption as Mount Mazama was large enough to cause its cone to implode, and Mt. Rainier's closest neighbor, Mount [...] St. Helens, had a huge chunk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the mountain blow up in a phreatic explosion caused by a mix of gas and water. Where St. Helens was once perfectly symmetrical there is now, thirty five years later, a huge crater at the top of one face.
