5|$|Kikai {{thought that}} work <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>boat</b> might be photogenic, but, having no experience, {{could not get}} a job on one. He was {{eventually}} accepted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>boat</b> fishing for tuna when he displayed the scar from an unneeded appendectomy as evidence of one risk fewer that his presence might force the boat into port. He worked on the boat in the Pacific from 6 April until 9 November 1972, with a stop in Manzanillo (Mexico) for provisions. It was during this time that he took his first photographs to be published, in the May 1973 issue of Camera Mainichi. In 1973 he won a prize for his submission to the 14th exhibition of the Japan Advertising Photographers’ Association. But Kikai decided that in order to be a photographer he needed darkroom skills, and he returned to Tokyo to work at Doi Technical Photo (1973–76). He became a freelance photographer in 1984, a year after his first solo exhibition and the same year as his second.|$|E

5|$|Tiller {{effect is}} the {{expression}} {{used to describe}} how handlebars that extend far behind the steering axis (head tube) act like a tiller <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>boat,</b> in that one moves the bars to the right in order to turn the front wheel to the left, and vice versa.
