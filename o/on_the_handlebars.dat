25|$|The {{down tube}} connects the head tube {{to the bottom}} bracket shell. On racing {{bicycles}} and some mountain and hybrid bikes, the derailleur cables run along the down tube, or inside the down tube. On older racing bicycles, the shift levers were mounted on the down tube. On newer ones, they are mounted with the brake levers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>handlebars.</b>|$|E

25|$|With {{hand-operated}} brakes, {{force is}} applied to brake levers mounted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>handlebars</b> and transmitted via Bowden cables or hydraulic lines to the friction pads, which apply pressure to the braking surface, causing friction which slows the bicycle down. A rear hub brake may be either hand-operated or pedal-actuated, as in the back pedal coaster brakes which were popular in North America until the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|The riding {{position}} {{places the}} feet forward and the hands are up relatively high, {{so that the}} spine is erect or leaning back slightly. At low to moderate speeds, cruisers are more comfortable than other styles, but riding for long periods at freeway speeds can lead to fatigue from pulling back <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>handlebars</b> to resist {{the force of the}} wind against the rider's chest. Cruisers have limited cornering ability {{due to a lack of}} ground clearance.|$|E
500|$|A YouTube {{viral video}} {{entitled}} [...] "Bike Hero" [...] showed {{what appeared to}} be a teenager riding a bike along a route marked with symbols similar in appearance to the in-game note tracks with LED lights <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>handlebars</b> blinking in time to the notes to the song [...] "Prisoner of Society" [...] by The Living End. The video was later determined to be the work of a viral marketing company Droga5 in cooperation with Activision to promote the Guitar Hero games. The viral advertisement was considered a success, with about 3.5 million views since its release.|$|E

500|$|Sinclair {{took the}} view that an {{electric}} vehicle needed to be designed from the ground up, completely rethinking the principles of automotive design rather than simply dropping electric components into an established model. He believed that the motor {{was the key to}} the design. Sinclair and Curry developed a wafer-thin motor that was mounted on a child's scooter, with a button <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>handlebars</b> to activate it. The research got no further, however, as Sinclair's development of the first [...] "slimline" [...] pocket calculator – the Sinclair Executive and its successors – took precedence. No further work on electric vehicles took place for {{most of the rest of}} the 1970s.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{adoption}} of the Loi Cadre reform on 23 June 1956, a territorial election was held in Côte d'Ivoire on 3 March 1957, in which the PDCI—transformed under Houphouët-Boigny's firm control into a political machine—won many seats. Houphouët-Boigny, who was already serving as a minister in France, as President of the Territorial Assembly and as mayor of Abidjan, chose Auguste Denise to serve as Vice President of the Government Council of Côte d'Ivoire, even though Houphouët-Boigny remained, the only interlocutor in the colony for France. Houphouët-Boigny's popularity and influence in France's African colonies had become so pervasive that one French magazine claimed that by 1956, the politician's photograph [...] "was in all the huts, on the lapels of coats, on the corsages of African women and even <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>handlebars</b> of bicycles".|$|E
500|$|In 2010, former cyclist Davide Cassani {{claimed in}} a YouTube video that Fabian Cancellara {{had used a}} {{motorized}} bike during his victories at the Tour of Flanders and the Paris–Roubaix that year. In the video, Cassani showed a normal road bike on a stand and after he pressed a button, the pedals began to rotate. Cassani then alleged that a motor could easily be stowed in the seattube of the bike and the button {{to turn it on}} would be located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>handlebars.</b> In the YouTube video, Cassani showed clips of Cancellara at the two races allegedly [...] "turning on" [...] the motor while riding and showing the drastic increase in speed. The claims caught steam since rumors were already going around about riders possibly using the new motor, the Gruber Assist, which could produce 100 Watts of power to aid the rider.|$|E

500|$|As {{the race}} reached the lower slopes of Ventoux, Simpson's team {{mechanic}} Harry Hall, witnessed Simpson, still ill, putting the lid {{back on his}} water bottle as he exited a building. Race commissaire (official), Jacques Lohmuller, later confirmed to Hall that he also saw the incident and that Simpson was putting brandy in his bottle. Near the summit of Ventoux, the peloton began to fracture. Simpson was in the front group before slipping back {{to a group of}} chasers about a minute behind. He then began losing control of his bike, zig-zagging across the road. A kilometre from the summit, Simpson fell off his bike. Team manager Alec Taylor and Hall arrived in the team car to help him. Hall tried to persuade Simpson to stop, saying: [...] "Come on Tom, that's it, that's your Tour finished", but Simpson said he wanted to continue. Taylor said, [...] "If Tom wants to go on, he goes". Noticing his toe straps were still undone, Simpson said, [...] "Me straps, Harry, me straps!" [...] They got him on his bike and pushed him off. Simpson's last words, as remembered by Hall, were [...] "On, on, on." [...] Hall estimated Simpson rode a further [...] before he began to wobble, and was held upright by spectators; he was unconscious, with his hands locked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>handlebars.</b> Hall and a nurse from the Tour's medical team took turns giving Simpson mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, before Dumas arrived with an oxygen mask. Approximately forty minutes after his collapse, a police helicopter took Simpson to nearby Avignon hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 5:40p.m. Two empty tubes and a half-full one of amphetamines, one of which was labelled [...] "Tonedron", were found in the rear pocket of his jersey. The official cause of death was [...] "heart failure caused by exhaustion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brake levers {{are usually}} mounted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>handlebars</b> {{within easy reach}} of the rider's hands. They may be {{distinct}} from or integrated into the shifting mechanism. [...] The brake lever transmits the force applied by the rider through either a mechanical or hydraulic mechanism.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} design of 1884 used a belt drive, and twist grip <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>handlebars</b> which applied the brake when turned {{one way and}} tensioned the drive belt, applying power to the wheel, when turned the other way. Roper's velocipede of the late 1860s used a similar two way twistgrip handlebar control. The plans also called for steering linkage shafts that made two right angle bends connected with gears, but the actual working model used a simple handlebar without the twist grip or gear linkage. [...] The design was patented on August 29, 1885.|$|E
50|$|In 1951, {{the rear}} {{suspension}} was upgraded to the Jampot unit, derided for its {{shape in the}} 28 September issue of the Motor Cycle magazine. In the same year minor changes included a new Lucas horn-push <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>handlebar</b> and a medallion badge {{in place of the}} previously used transfer. Front fork shuttle damping was also replaced with rod and damper-type.|$|R
50|$|Particularly in slow traffic, a cyclist's look to {{the rear}} {{may serve as a}} signal, {{allowing}} the cyclist to keep both hands <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>handlebar.</b> However, a cyclist may also use a hand signal (arm extended to the side) to request that an overtaking driver make room. The cyclist then follows up with a second {{look to the}} rear to assure that the driver has made room.|$|R
5000|$|The Hildebrand & Wolfmüller patent of 20 January 1894, No. 78553 {{describes}} a [...] two-cylinder, four-stroke engine, with a {{bore and stroke}} of 90 x 117 mm. It produced [...] @ 240 rpm propelling a weight of 50 kg up to a maximum speed of 45 km/h.The fuel-air mixture from the surface carburettor was regulated by a valve operated by controls <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>handlebar.</b> <b>The</b> engine, which was positioned flat in the frame, used hot tube ignition with the tube heater {{in front of the}} cylinder heads. The tube heater was ventilated by the lower downtubes while the upper downtubes held lubricating oil.|$|R
2500|$|Because wheel flop {{involves}} the lowering {{of the front}} end of a bicycle or motorcycle, the force due to gravity will tend to cause handlebar rotation to continue with increasing rotational velocity and without additional rider input <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>handlebars.</b> [...] Once the handlebars are turned, the rider needs to apply torque to the handlebars to bring them back to the straight ahead position and bring {{the front end of}} the bicycle or motorcycle back up to the original height. [...] The rotational inertia of the front wheel will lessen the severity of the wheel flop effect because it results in opposing torque being required to initiate or accelerate changing the direction of the front wheel.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{more black}} youths, Johnny Robinson and Virgil Ware, were {{shot to death}} in Birmingham within seven hours of the Sunday morning bombing. Robinson, aged 16, was shot in the back by a {{policeman}} as he fled down an alley, after ignoring police orders to halt. The police were reportedly responding to black youths throwing rocks at cars driven by white people. Robinson died before reaching the hospital. Ware, aged 13, was shot in the cheek and chest with a revolver in a residential suburb 15 miles north of the city. A 16-year-old white youth named Larry Sims fired the gun (given to him by another youth named Michael Farley) at Ware, who was sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>handlebars</b> of a bicycle ridden by his brother. Sims and Farley had been riding home from an anti-integration rally which had denounced the church bombing. When he spotted Ware and his brother, Sims fired twice, reportedly with his eyes closed. (Sims and Farley were later convicted of second-degree manslaughter, although the judge suspended their sentences and imposed two years' probation upon each youth.) ...|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> driver stood <b>on</b> a {{platform}} with 10-inch tires and operated the machine using only <b>the</b> <b>handlebars</b> and steering column, pushing them forward {{to engage the}} clutch, using a lever <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>handlebar</b> to control <b>the</b> throttle, and pulling <b>the</b> <b>handlebars</b> and column back to disengage the clutch and apply the brake. After riding, the steering column would be folded onto the platform to store the scooter more easily. The engine was an air-cooled, 4-stroke, 155 cc engine over the front wheel. The bike came with a headlamp and tail lamp, a Klaxon horn, and a toolbox. Developed during wartime and gasoline rationing, it was quite efficient, but was not widely distributed. An electric version was also available with a motor <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front wheel.|$|R

50|$|A curved {{fork and}} angled {{vertical}} tubing provides stable, non-twitchy steering, enabling the rider {{to ride with}} one hand, while freeing the other hand for signalling or to secure a load <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rear rack. Europeans commonly use the free hand to hold an umbrella or cell phone, or to hold the shoulder of a child riding their own bike, to train the child for positioning <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road.
