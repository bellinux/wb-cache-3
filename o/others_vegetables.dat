5000|$|The Products sold in people's {{markets are}} {{typically}} those comprising a Mediterranean diet, {{known for its}} healthy qualities, and are key ingredients in the cuisine of Greece. They are mainly local food, known as ntopia (ντόπια) in Greek, such as fresh fruits (including, depending on the season, oranges, apples, watermelons, melons, strawberries, and <b>others),</b> <b>vegetables</b> (like cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, potatoes, broccoli, carrots, and others), leaf vegetables (e.g. lettuce or antrakla), chicken eggs from suburban farms, and fish (for example sardines, European seabass, red mullets) recently caught from nearby seas (often caught the same day sold). Usually local food sold in people's markets is produced by family farms within the same geographical region as the market, and the [...] "producers" [...] who sell the local foodstuffs in the people's markets are usually the farmers themselves who travel from market to market in nearby towns to sell their produce directly to consumers.|$|E

Beside many common vegetable species like tomatoes, pepper, eggplant, onion, garlic, cabbage, cucumber, lettuce and so on - can be cultivated in small areas many <b>others</b> <b>vegetables</b> like broccoli, Brussels cabbage, Scorzonera hispanica, asparagus, Witloof Chicory (French endive) and vegetable with medicinal properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{soilless culture}} of {{vegetables}} in greenhouse {{has increased in}} Turkey. In recent years, bunch tomato has grown in soilless culture. However, bacterial can-cer, virus (TMV, TYLVC) andTutaabsulta are limited tomato growing soilless culture as well. For this reason, <b>others</b> <b>vegetables</b> such as eggplant and pepper can be alternative crop for soilless culture. The {{aim of the research}} is determination of growing media such as cocopeat, split mushroom compost, perlite, volcanic tuff and sawdust on yield and fruit quality of eggplant. Our results suggest that mush-room compost and cocopeat media improve eggplant fruit quality more than other growing media. Key words: Solanum melongena, substrate culture, fruit qualit...|$|E

40|$|This study quantifies {{the water}} {{footprint}} of consumption (WFcons) regarding agricultural products for three diets – the current diet (REF), {{a healthy diet}} (HEALTHY) and a vegetarian diet (VEG) – for the four EU zones WEST, NORTH, SOUTH and EAST. The WFcons related to the {{consumption of agricultural products}} (4265 l per capita per day or lcd) accounts for 89 % of the EU's total WFcons (4815 lcd). The effect of diet has therefore an essential impact on the total WFcons. The current zonal WFcons regarding agricultural products is: 5875 lcd (SOUTH), 4053 lcd (EAST), 3761 lcd (WEST) and 3197 lcd (NORTH). These differences are the result of different consumption behaviours as well as different agricultural production methods and conditions. From the perspective of a healthy diet based on regional dietary guidelines, the intake of several product groups (sugar, crop oils, animal fats and meat) should be decreased and increased for <b>others</b> (<b>vegetables,</b> fruit). The WFcons regarding agricultural products for the alternative diets are the following: HEALTHY 4110 lcd (− 30 %) and VEG 3476 lcd (− 41 %) for SOUTH; HEALTHY 3606 lcd (− 11 %) and VEG 2956 lcd (− 27 %) for EAST; HEALTHY 2766 lcd (− 26 %) and VEG 2208 lcd (− 41 %) for WEST; HEALTHY 3091 lcd (− 3 %) and VEG 2166 lcd (− 32 %) for NORTH. Both the healthy and vegetarian diets thus result – consistent for all zones – in substantial WFcons reductions. The largest reduction takes place for the vegetarian diet. Indeed, a lot of water can be saved by EU citizens by a change in their diet...|$|E
40|$|Air {{pollution}} in Indonesia 70 % has caused by motor vehicle emissions that contribute almost 98 % of lead into the air. Lead (Pb) is a toxic and dangerous heavy metals {{that can be}} toxic {{to the environment and}} {{have an impact on the}} entire system in the body. Which can be contaminated environment can be air, water, soil, food and <b>others.</b> <b>Vegetables</b> are the example of food that can be contaminated by lead. The objective of this study was to determine the content of lead (Pb) in lettuce and cabbage that sold in Kampung Lalang market Medan based on the distance of trade locations from the highway. The research method is descriptive survey. The examination using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. The study found that the highest lead levels found in lettuce that sold at trade location 0 meter from the highway before washing in the amount of 1. 43 mg/kg, once washed lettuce levels of lead decreased to 1. 07 mg/kg, and lettuce which closed the levels of lead of 0. 69 mg/kg. The highest lead levels in cabbage that sold at trade location 0 meter from the highway before washing in the amount of 0. 57 mg/kg, once washed cabbage levels of lead decreased to 0. 39 mg/kg, and cabbage which closed the levels of lead 0. 29 mg/kg. The conclusion of this study was the closer the location of trade to the highway, the higher the lead levels found in vegetables. Metal content of lead (Pb) that is checked is still below the threshold limit value requirements established by the Director General of POM Decree No: 03725 /B/SK/VII/ 89 on the maximum limit metal contamination in food that is 2 mg / kg. Traders are advised to pay more attention to the cleanliness of vegetables lettuce and cabbage, for example, provide cover on the vegetables being contaminated by pollutants. To consumers are suggested to wash vegetables before consumed using flowing water...|$|E
