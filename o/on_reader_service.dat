D) DEPUTY UNIVERSITY LIBRARIAN UNIVERSITY OF CALABAR LIBRARY CALABAR E- mail: nkyedem@yahoo. com ABSTRACT This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in four (4) University libraries, (two states and two federal) in the south – south zone of Nigeria to provide information on the perception of both librarians and <b>readers</b> <b>on</b> the influence of information source parameters (obsolete information sources and availability of relevant information sources), as well as personal characteristics of librarians (attitude and experience) <b>on</b> <b>readers</b> ability to retrieve information. The study used survey design to determine by means of a one item in a four point likert scale questionnaire, the influence of these variables <b>on</b> <b>reader’s</b> ability to retrieve information. Four (4) hypotheses were tested. Out of the total of 700 library registered undergraduate students, only 698 students and all the 9 librarians answered and returned usable questionnaires. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS} and t-test was used for data analysis. The major findings are that all the four hypotheses tested, rejected the null hypotheses, which means that all these variables influence reader’s ability to retrieve information. This calls for the librarians to improve upon their personal characteristics as well as the provision of relevant information sources if quality reference services are to be attained. Based on these findings, recommendations were made, the major ones of which are the automation and internet connectivity of the reference section of the library, provision of current and relevant information, online access to information sources/e-library and re-training of librarians especially those librarians working in the <b>reader’s</b> <b>services</b> libraries.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the demographic factors and personality {{of a group of}} qualified Tasmanian librarians. Ninety five librarians employed at the academic, public, school and special institutions were tested during May to July, 1973. The tests administered were the 16 PF-Form A, the EPI-Form A, and an information sheet. The findings: (1) Half the female librarians are relatively young; the majority of librarians live in Hobart and the surrounding suburbs, especially the southern Hobart area; the majority are of Australian and British nationality; over half the librarians are married; the female librarians tend to receive lower salaries; most librarians possess B. A degrees; a third of librarians in all institutions have obtained their qualifications since 1970; {{and there has been a}} considerable growth of librarianship in Tasmania. (2) Generally, librarians are of above average intelligence, experimenting, critical, self-sufficient, resourceful, resolute persons. They tend to be neither unduly attentive to nor conventional in practical matters but to be a sensitive, effeminate, aesthetically inclined group. They tend to be aloof and reserved persons, who prefer working alone rather than dealing with people. As a group, librarians tend also to be casual and less dependable. (3) Although both <b>reader</b> <b>services</b> and technical services librarians exhibit the above average qualities, <b>reader</b> <b>services</b> librarians tend to be less attentive to or conventional in practical matters but possessing more self-confidence. (4) Technical services staff, especially older technical services librarians, female technical services librarians and female cataloguers, are more silent, serious and uncommunicative than <b>reader</b> <b>services</b> staff. (5) Results generally concur with previous studies of the librarian and at least dispel the image that reference librarians are extraverted and cataloguers are introverted...|$|R
