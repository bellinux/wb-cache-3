5|$|Georg Forster {{was born}} in the small village of Nassenhuben (Mokry Dwór) near Danzig (Gdańsk), in the {{province}} of Royal Prussia, in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. He was the oldest of seven surviving children of Johann Reinhold Forster and Justina Elisabeth (née Nicolai). His father was a naturalist, scientist and Reformed pastor. In 1765, the Russian empress Catherine II commissioned the pastor to travel through Russia on a research journey and investigate the situation of a German colony on the Volga River.

Claudia seeks Heather to birth the cult's god, since Heather is Alessa's reincarnation.|$|E
5|$|Hogg {{moved from}} York to London {{in the spring}} of 1812 to study law.

In April 1814, Hogg went to Ireland in an attempt to cheer up Percy Shelley, who had complained of poor spirits in a letter.

5|$|However, the two missionaries, who {{had become}} just as much explorers as they were missionaries, became quite {{interested}} in Kilimanjaro, and Krapf sought permission of the Mombasa governor for an expedition {{to the land of}} the Jagga, a people now known as the Chaga, who lived and live on the actual slopes of Kilimanjaro. Krapf told the governor that this journey would be work-based.

This is the earliest recorded sighting of the volcano by European explorers.|$|E

The crusaders briefly occupied the castle in February {{of the same year}} but abandoned it when they continued their march towards Jerusalem. Permanent occupation began in 1110 when Tancred, Prince of Galilee took control of the site. The early castle was substantially different from the extant remains and no trace of this first castle survives at the site.|$|E
