40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the growth and development pattern of under two year age children <b>of</b> <b>mother</b> with maternal goiter. The research design was retrospective cohort. The Study was conducted in Banyu Arang village, Ngoro Sub distric, Jombang Distric, because this village was categorized as severe endemic goiter area. The observed variables were iodine status of children, the growth parameters such as body weight gain, nutritional status, head circumference, chest circumference; the development parameters such as motor miles stone, and score of pre screening questionnaire for development (KPSP). The result of the study indicated that prevalence of maternal goiter was 48. 21 %, prevalence of iodine deficiency among under two years children was 8. 93 %. Median of urinary iodine excretion amongchildren <b>of</b> <b>mother</b> with maternal goiter was 404 Î¼g/L and 506 Î¼g/L for children <b>of</b> <b>mother</b> without maternal goiter. Mean of birth weight among children <b>of</b> <b>mother</b> with maternal goiter was 3. 02 kg and 2. 96 kg for children <b>of</b> <b>mother</b> without maternal goiter. The growth rate <b>of</b> children <b>of</b> <b>mother</b> with maternal goiter was 278. 33 gram and 264. 16 gram for children <b>of</b> <b>mother</b> without maternal goiter.

5|$|Many traditions have {{stressed}} the grief <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> over deprivation {{of their children}} but little has been said historically about young children's loss of their mothers; {{this may have been}} because loss of the mother in infancy frequently meant death for a breast-fed infant. In the 19th century, French society bureaucratised a system in which infants were breast-fed at the homes of foster mothers, returning to the biological family after weaning, and no concern was evinced at the possible effect of this double separation on the child.|$|E

Particularity stable giraffe groups are those made <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> and their young, which can last weeks or months.

In general, females are more selective than males in who they associate with in regards to individuals of the same sex. Young males also form groups and will engage in playfights. However, as they get older males become more solitary but may also associate in pairs or with female groups. Giraffes are not territorial, but they have home ranges. Male giraffes occasionally wander far from areas that they normally frequent.|$|E
5|$|Over time, the {{characterisation}} of Shashthi {{underwent a}} gradual evolution. Aforementioned folk traditions originating between the 10th and 5th centuries BCE associated the goddess with {{both positive and}} negative elements of fertility, birth, motherhood and childhood. However, between the 4th century BCE and the 5th century CE, a shift occurred in which Shashthi was increasingly depicted as a malevolent deity associated with the sufferings <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> and children. The fifth century text Kashyapa Samhita calls Shashthi by the epithet Jataharini ("one who steals the born") and provides a list of the malevolent activities in which Shashthi is believed to engage, including her practice of stealing foetuses from the womb and devouring children on the sixth day following birth. For this reason, the text recommends that she be propitiated through worship in her honour on this day in the lying-in room and on the sixth day of every fortnight thereafter.|$|E

5|$|In 2014, {{there were}} 39,566 live births in Croatia, {{comprising}} 20,374 male and 19,192 female children. Virtually {{all of those}} were performed in medical facilities; only 19 births occurred elsewhere. Out of the total number, 32,677 children were born in wedlock or within 300days {{after the end of}} the marriage, and the average age <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> at the birth of their first child was 28.4 years. General fertility rate, i.e. number of births per 1,000 women aged 15–49 is 42.9, with the age specific rate peaking at 101.0 per million for women aged 25–29. In 2009, 52,414 persons died in Croatia, 48.5% of whom died in medical facilities and 90.0% of whom were receiving medical treatment at the time. Cardiovascular disease and cancer were the primary causes of death in the country, with 26,235 and 13,280 deaths respectively. In the same year, there were 2,986 violent deaths, including 2,121 due to accidents. The latter figure includes 616 deaths in traffic accidents. In 2014, the birth rate was 9.3 per mille, exceeded by the mortality rate of 12.0 per mille. The infant mortality rate was 5.0 per mille in 2014. In terms of age structure, the population of Croatia is dominated by the 15–64year older segment (68.1%), while the size of the population younger than 15 and older than 64 is relatively small (15.1% and 16.9% respectively). The median age of the population is 41.4. The sex ratio of the population is 1.06 males per 1 female at birth and up to 14 years of age, and 0.99 males per 1 female between the ages of 15 and 64. But at ages over 64 the ratio is 0.64 males per 1 female. The ratio for the total population is 0.93 males per 1 female.|$|E
