5|$|The {{successful}} {{attack on}} Hammersmith Bridge encouraged the RIRA leadership to launch further attacks in Northern Ireland. On 19 June 2000 a bomb {{was found in}} the grounds of Hillsborough Castle, home of Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Peter Mandelson. On 30 June a bomb exploded on the Dublin-to-Belfast railway line near the village of Meigh in County Armagh. The explosion damaged the tracks, and caused disruption to train services. On 9 July a car bomb damaged buildings in Stewartstown, County Tyrone including an RUC station, and on 10 August an attack in Derry was thwarted by the RUC after a van containing a 500lb bomb failed to stop at a police checkpoint. Following a car chase the bombers escaped across the Irish border, and the Irish Army carried out a controlled explosion on the bomb after the van was found abandoned in County Donegal. On 13 September two 80lb bombs were planted at the Magilligan army camp in County Londonderry, one of which was planted in a wooden hut and partially exploded when a soldier <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hut. The second bomb was found during a follow-up search and made safe by bomb disposal experts. On 11 November the RUC and British Army prevented a mortar attack after stopping a van near Derrylin, County Fermanagh, and the RUC prevented a further attack on 13 January 2001 when an 1100lb bomb was found in Armagh — the largest bomb found in several years according to the RUC.|$|E

25|$|In 1950, {{an attempt}} was made to abolish capital punishment.

25|$|According to Shia view, Muawiyah opposed Ali, out {{of sheer}} greed for power and wealth.

Muawiyah {{is alleged to have}} killed many of Muhammad's companions (Sahabah), either in battle or by poison, due to his lust for power. Muawiyah killed several historical figures, including the Sahabah, Amr bin al-Hamiq, Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, Malik al-Ashtar, Hujr ibn Adi (to which the families of Abu Bakr and Umar condemned Muawiyah for, and the Sahaba deemed his killer to be cursed) and Abd al-Rahman bin Hasaan (buried alive for his support of Ali).|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{her career}} Wilkinson was an {{opponent}} of imperialism. In February 1927 she attended the Founding Congress of the League Against Imperialism in Brussels, where she met and befriended the Indian nationalist leader Jawaharlal Nehru. In 1927 she {{was elected to the}} Labour Party's National Executive, which gave her a voice in the formulation of party policy. Her advance was noted with approval by Beatrice Webb, who saw in her a future candidate for high office—ahead of more senior Labour women such as Margaret Bondfield and Susan Lawrence. A tireless campaigner for women's equality, she challenged the caricature of voteless younger women as 'flappers'. On 29 March 1928 Wilkinson voted in the House of Commons for the bill that became the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928, granting the vote to all women aged 21 or over. During the debate she said: [...] "e are doing at last a great act of justice to the women of the country... just as we have [...] <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> older women, tonight we are opening it to those who are just entering on the threshold of life and in whose hands is the new life of the future country {{that we are going to}} build".|$|E
500|$|Dostoyevsky {{began working}} on Poor Folk in early 1844. He first {{mentioned}} the upcoming work {{in a letter to}} Mikhail on 30 September 1844: [...] "I am finishing up a novel of the size of Eugénie Grandet. It's a rather original work." [...] Dostoyevsky later wrote to his brother on 23 March 1845, [...] "I finished the novel in November, then rewrote it in December, and again in February–March. I am seriously satisfied with my novel. It is a serious and elegant work..." [...] Sometime around April 1845, his friend Dmitry Grigorovich, with whom he had shared an apartment since the autumn of 1844, proposed giving the manuscript to poet Nikolay Nekrasov, who was planning to issue an anthology in 1846. Dostoyevsky took the manuscript to Nekrasov and returned home. Shortly afterwards the doorbell of his house rang, and he <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> excited Nekrasov and Grigorovich, both of whom congratulated him on his debut novel, of which they had only read 10 pages. They finished the full 112-page work during the night at Dostoyevsky's apartment. The next morning, the three men went to the critic Vissarion Belinsky; Nekrasov proclaimed Dostoyevsky [...] "the New Gogol" [...] though Belinsky replied sceptically [...] "You find Gogol's springing up like mushrooms". Dostoyevsky himself did not believe his book would receive a positive review from Belinsky, but when Nekrasov visited Belinsky in the evening, the latter wanted to meet Dostoyevsky to congratulate him on his debut. Dostoyevsky proposed to issue Poor Folk in the Fatherland Notes, but it was instead published in the almanac St. Petersburg Collection on January 15, 1846.|$|E

2500|$|The {{crash was}} the first fire {{incident}} on the 747 Combi and one of few fires on widebody aircraft. Fred Bereswill, the investigator from Boeing, characterised the Flight 295 fire as significant for this reason. [...] Barry Strauch of the NTSB visited Boeing's headquarters to inquire about the Combi's design. Boeing's fire test in the Combi models did not accurately match {{the conditions of the}} Helderberg's cargo hold; in accordance with federal US rules, the Boeing test involved setting a bale of tobacco leaves ablaze. The fire stayed within the cargo hold. The air in the passenger cabin was designed to have a marginally higher pressure than cargo area hold, so if a crew member <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cargo hold, the air from the passenger cabin would flow into the cargo hold, stopping any smoke or gases from exiting through the door.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1980s, Friedländer {{engaged in}} a {{spirited}} debate with the West German historian Martin Broszat over his call for the [...] "historicization" [...] of Nazi Germany. In Friedländer’s view, Nazi Germany was not and cannot {{be seen as a}} normal period of history. Friedländer argued that there were three dilemmas, and three problems involved in the [...] "historicization" [...] of the Third Reich. The first dilemma was that of historical periodization, and how long-term social changes could be related {{to an understanding of the}} Nazi period. Friedländer argued that focusing on long-term social changes such as the growth of the welfare state from the Imperial to Weimar to the Nazi eras to the present as Broszat suggested changed the focus on historical research from the particular of the Nazi era to the general long duration of 20th-century German history. Friedländer felt that [...] "relative relevance" [...] of the growth of the welfare state under the Third Reich, and its relationship to post-war developments would cause historians to lose their attention to the genocidal politics of the Nazi state. The second dilemma Friedländer felt that by treating the Nazi period as a [...] "normal" [...] period of history, and by examining the aspects of [...] "normality" [...] might run the danger of causing historians to lose interest in the [...] "criminality" [...] of the Nazi era. This was especially problematic for Friedländer because he contended that aspects of [...] "normality" [...] and [...] "criminality" [...] very much overlapped in the everyday life of Nazi Germany. The third dilemma involved what Friedländer considered the vague definition of [...] "historicization" [...] entailed, and it might allow historians to advance apologetic arguments about National Socialism such as those Friedländer accused Ernst Nolte and Andreas Hillgruber of making. However, Friedländer conceded that Broszat was not an apologist for Nazi Germany like Nolte and Hillgruber. Friedländer noted that though the concept of [...] "historicization" [...] was highly awkward, partly because it <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> type of arguments that Nolte and Hillgruber advanced during the Historikerstreit, Broszat's motives in calling for the [...] "historicization" [...] were honourable.|$|E
