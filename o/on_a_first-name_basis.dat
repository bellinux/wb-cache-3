[...] Carson pressed him on the answer, repeatedly asking why the boy's ugliness was relevant.

40|$|Economists worry {{endlessly}} {{about the}} manufacturing sector (could GM really go bankrupt?), {{not to mention the}} high-tech sector (whither the Nasdaq?). Economists sometimes refer to the service sector, and pay attention to specific industries such as health. They probably don’t even know there is something called the “care sector ” unless they are girls or as Governor Schwarzenegger puts it, “girlie men. ” Yet the care sector is a topic of increasing interest among political activists and trade unions, as well as feminist scholars. Tonight, I will try to persuade you that some economists actually have something useful to say about it. I define the care sector as economic activities in the home, market, community and state that have a particularly strong personal and emotional dimension: activities such as childrearing, child care, health care, elder care, and education. These are activities that are often provided <b>on</b> <b>a</b> face-to-face or <b>first-name</b> <b>basis,</b> and they often involve the care of dependents. Much of my work on the care sector has focused on women’s non-market work in the home, but tonight I will focus on the portion of the care sector that involves paid employment. Economists and policy makers often mistakenly assume that paid care services can be produced like any other commodity. They are, obviously, subject to the laws of supply an...|$|R

Nanba also explained the change from [...] to [...] "Social Link", regarding the gameplay mechanic, as [...] "community" [...] has a different meaning in English, whereas Igor in his speeches often refers to [...] "society" [...] and [...] "bonds".

40|$|More than {{a decade}} ago, the World Health Organization pointed out {{the degree to which}} deficits in the production, sharing, and use of {{critical}} health information hampered evidence-based health development in countries with the poorest health status [1]. This “information paradox ” in global health came to refer to the predicament in which countries with the greatest need for timely, accurate, and comprehensive health information- including on causes of death at the population level-have had the least access to it [2, 3]. Since that time, some (but not enough) improvements in information systems and technologies have begun to fill voids in our knowledge of population health [4, 5]. Throughout this period, however, comparatively little {{attention has been paid to}} advancing the science and practice of direct measurement of mortality and its causes- particularly among adults [6 - 11]. In 2000, the state of knowledge on verbal autopsy (VA, a term that covers the design and application of postmortem caregiver interviews, procedures for assigning one or more probable causes of death, and the aggregation and tabulation of population-level mortality statistics based on this data source) centered <b>on</b> <b>a</b> small group of demographers and epidemiologists, many of whom ran intervention trials in various demographic surveillance sites.

Throughout this period, those who remained dedicated to maximizing the potential of VA made steady progress.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new idea}} in describing people using their first names, i. e., the name assigned at birth. We show that describing people in terms of similarity to a vec-tor of possible first names is a powerful description of facial appearance {{that can be used}} for face naming and building facial attribute classifiers. We build models for 100 common first names used in the United States and for each pair, construct <b>a</b> pairwise <b>first-name</b> classifier. These classifiers are built using training im-ages downloaded from the internet, with no additional user interaction. This gives our approach important advantages in building practical systems that do not require additional human intervention for labeling. We use the scores from each pairwise name classifier as a set of facial attributes. We show several surprising results. Our name attributes predict the correct first names of test faces at rates far greater than chance. The name attributes are applied to gender recognition and to age classification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with all training images automati-cally gathered from the internet. 1...|$|R
