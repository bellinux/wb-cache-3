Although such environments are unusual, they do confer potential advantages for navigation. Three independent attributes of spatial overlap, as applied to 3 -D virtual environments (VEs), are described, together with their likely effects on navigation. An experiment that investigated one type of <b>overlap</b> (<b>loop</b> connectivity) is described. Participants learned spatial knowledge more slowly in an overlapping VE than in a conventional VE, but the differences were small and, after initial navigation, not significant. Therefore, {{there seems to be no}} cognitive barrier to the useful implementation of overlapping VEs within a wide variety of applications. ...|$|R

Channel- SLAM uses multipath propagation to allow positioning for an insufficient number of transmitters or increase the accuracy otherwise. Channel-SLAM treats multipath components (MPCs) as signals from virtual transmitters (VTs) which are time syn- chronized to the physical transmitter and fixed in their position. To use the information of the MPCs, Channel-SLAM estimates the receiver position and {{the position of the}} VTs simultaneously using simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and does not require any prior information such as room-layout or a database for fingerprinting. This paper investigates mapping, where we derive a probabilistic map representation based on the receiver positions. Thus, if the receiver knows its current location, the information in the probabilistic map helps to estimate the trajectory of further receiver movement. Hence, as soon as the receiver returns to an already mapped position, information of the probabilistic map can be used for the movement to obtain better estimations of the receiver position. The algorithm is evaluated based on measurements with one fixed transmitter and a moving pedestrian which moves on partially <b>overlapping</b> <b>loops...</b>|$|E

40|$|POLCA (i. e. Paired-cell <b>Overlapping</b> <b>Loops</b> of Cards with Authorization) is a card-based {{production}} control approach developed {{to support the}} adoption of Quick Response Manufacturing. The approach has received significant research attention but has remained largely unchanged since its introduction in the late 1990 s. The main improvements {{have occurred in the}} context of an electronic POLCA system, but such developments undermine the simplicity of the original card-based concept. We ask: is there any refinement possible to enhance the performance of POLCA without jeopardizing its simplicity? By analyzing POLCA, two possible refinements are identified: (i) the choice of rule to support both the card allocation and dispatching decisions; and (ii) the use of a starvation avoidance mechanism to overcome premature station idleness, as reported in the context of load limiting order release. Using simulation, we demonstrate that performance gains can be obtained by using different rules for card allocation and dispatching other than the earliest release date rule typically applied in POLCA for both decisions. Further, results demonstrate performance improvements for all combinations of card allocation and dispatching rules considered via the addition of a simple starvation avoidance mechanism. Both refinements significantly enhance POLCA performance, potentially furthering its application in practice. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{is meant}} to show the {{effective}} capability of optimizing an unbalanced Paired-Cell <b>Overlapping</b> <b>Loops</b> of Cards with Authorization (POLCA) -controlled production system {{by means of a}} heuristic algorithm. This objective is suggested by the fact {{that one of the most}} significant issues when using card-driven production control systems is represented by the optimized setting of the large number of cards within the control loops. This is particularly true in the case of unbalanced systems, where the number of cards may vary significantly among the different loops. Little law is usually adopted in literature to infer this number from historical data, but the obtained number is usually far from the optimum. Indeed, in real-world applications, the systems to be controlled are designed to process units with very different routings, each with different probability to occur. In all these situations, they result particularly difficult to set correctly. To this aim, in the present work a Genetic Algorithm is used. The objective is that of finding the correct number of cards and to reduce the overall Total Throughput Time and the average Work In Process. The proposed approach may provide a valid support tool to overcome these limitations, making the most of POLCA capabilities in many manufacturing configurations...|$|E
