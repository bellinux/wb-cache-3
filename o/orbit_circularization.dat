40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of a massive black hole pair in a rotationally supported nuclear disc. The distributions of stars and gas mimic the nuclear region of a gas-rich galaxy merger remnant. Using high-resolution SPH simulations, we follow the black hole dynamics and trace {{the evolution of}} the underlying background, until the black holes form a binary. We find that the gravitational perturbation of the pair creates a core in the disc density profile, hence decreasing the gas-dynamical drag. This leads the newly formed binary to stall at a separation of ~ 5 pc. In the early phases of the sinking, black holes lose memory of their initial orbital eccentricity if they co-rotate with the disc, as rotation of the gaseous background promotes circularization of the black hole <b>orbits.</b> <b>Circularization</b> is efficient until the black holes bind in a binary, though in the latest stages of the simulations a residual eccentricity > 0. 1 is still present. Black holes are treated as sink particles, allowing for gas accretion.

50|$|Tidal heating (also {{known as}} tidal working or tidal flexing) occurs through the tidal {{friction}} processes: orbital energy is dissipated as heat {{in either the}} surface ocean or interior of a planet or satellite. When an object is in an elliptical orbit, the tidal forces acting on it are stronger near periapsis than by apoapsis. Thus the deformation of the body due to tidal forces (i.e. the tidal bulge) varies {{over the course of}} its orbit, generating internal friction which heats its interior. This energy gained by the object comes from its gravitational energy, so over time in a two-body system, the initial elliptical orbit decays into a circular <b>orbit</b> (tidal <b>circularization).</b> Sustained tidal heating occurs when the elliptical orbit is prevented from circularizing due to additional gravitational forces that keep tugging the object back into an elliptical orbit.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the orbital evolution of satellite galaxies using numerical simulations.

This circularization was confirmed by numerous simulations where dynamical friction is added as external force. However, some of the resent N-body simulations demonstrated that circularization is much slower than expected from approximate calculations. We found that the dominant reason for this discrepancy {{is the assumption that}} Coulomb logarithm log Lambda is constant, which has been used in practically all recent calculations. Since the size of the satellite is relatively large, accurate determination of the outer cutoff radius is crucial to obtain good estimate for the dynamical friction. An excellent agreement between $N$-body simulations and approximate calculations was observed when the outer cutoff radius is taken to be the distance of the satellite {{to the center of the}} galaxy. When satellite is at the perigalacticon, the distance to the center is smaller and therefore log Lambda becomes smaller. As a result, the dynamical friction becomes less effective. We apply our result to the Large Magellanic Cloud. We found that the expected lifetime of the LMC is twice as long as that would be predicted with previous calculations. Previous study predicts that the LMC will merge into the Milky Way after 7 G years, while we found that the merging will take place after 14 G years from now.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{the formation of a}} circumstellar wide-orbit gas giant planet in a multiple stellar system. We consider a model of orbital circularization for the core of a giant planet after it is scattered from an inner disk region by a more massive planet, which was proposed by Kikuchi et al (2014). We extend their model for single star systems to binary (multiple) star systems, by taking into account tidal truncation of the protoplanetary gas disk by a binary companion. As an example, we consider a wide-orbit gas giant in a hierarchical triple system, HD 131399 Ab. The best-fit orbit of the planet is that with semimajor axis ∼ 80 au and eccentricity ∼ 0. 35. As the binary separation is ∼ 350 au, it is very close to the stability limit, which is puzzling. With the original core location ∼ 20 - 30 au, the core (planet) mass ∼ 50 M_ E and the disk truncation radius ∼ 150 au, our model reproduces the best-fit orbit of HD 131399 Ab. We find that the <b>orbit</b> after the <b>circularization</b> is usually close to the stability limit against the perturbations from the binary companion, because the scattered core accretes gas from the truncated disk.

In contrast, a tidal capture model places the moon in an elliptical <b>orbit</b> undergoing progressive <b>circularization</b> from the time of capture (for model purposes about 3. 9 billion years ago) for at least a few 10 (exp 8) years following the capture event.

40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{have shown}} {{that at least some}} close-in exoplanets maintain eccentric <b>orbits</b> despite tidal <b>circularization</b> timescales that are typically shorter than stellar ages. We explore gravitational interactions with a distant planetary companion as a possible cause of these non-zero eccentricities. For simplicity, we focus on the evolution of a planar two-planet system subject to slow eccentricity damping and provide an intuitive interpretation of the resulting long-term orbital evolution. We show that dissipation shifts the two normal eigenmode frequencies and eccentricity ratios of the standard secular theory slightly, and that each mode decays at its own rate. Tidal damping of the eccentricities drives orbits to transition between periods of pericenter circulation and libration, and the planetary system settles into a locked state where the pericenters are nearly aligned or anti-aligned. Once in the locked state, the eccentricities of the two orbits decrease very slowly due to tides rather than at the much more rapid single-planet rate, and thus eccentric orbits, even for close-in planets, can often survive much longer than the age of the system. Assuming that an observed close-in planet on an elliptical orbit is apsidally-locked to a more distant, and perhaps unseen companion, we provide a constraint on the mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity of the companion. We find the observed two-planet system HAT-P- 13 might be in just such an apsidally-locked state, with parameters that obey our constraint well. We also survey close-in single planets, and found that none provide compelling evidence for unseen companions. Instead, we suspect that (1) orbits are circular, (2) tidal damping rates are slower than our assumption, or (3) a recent event has excited these eccentricities. Our method should prove useful for interpreting the results of current and future planet searches. Comment: 18 pages, 14 figures, ApJ (in press...|$|R
40|$|Spacecraft {{propulsion}} {{and power}} {{for many decades}} has relied on Hydrazine monopropellant technology for auxiliary power units (APU), orbital <b>circularization,</b> <b>orbit</b> raising/lowering and attitude control. However, Hydrazine is toxic and therefore requires special ground handling procedures to ensure launch crew safety. The Swedish Company ECAPS has developed a technology based upon the propellant Ammonium Dinitramide (ADN) that offers higher performance, higher density and reduced ground handling support than Hydrazine. This blended propellant is called LMP- 103 S. Currently, the United States Air Force (USAF) is pursuing a technology based on Hydroxyl Ammonium Nitrate (HAN, otherwise known as AF-M 315 E) with industry partners Aerojet and Moog. Based on the advantages offered by these propellants, MSFC should explore powering APU's with these propellants. Due to the availability of space hardware, the principal investigator has found a collection of USAF hardware, that will act as a surrogate, which operates on a Hydrazine derivative. The F- 16 fighter jet uses H- 70 or 30 % diluted Hydrazine for an Emergency Power Unit (EPU) which supplies power to the plane. The PI has acquired two EPU's from planes slated for destruction at the Davis Monthan AFB. This CIF will include a partnership with 2 other NASA Centers who are individually seeking seed funds from their respective organizations: Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC).

40|$|The tidal torque on an early-type star is {{concentrated}} near {{the boundary between}} the convective core and radiative envelope and a train of gravity waves is excited there. The angular momentum which the torque removes from the fluid is transported outward by the gravity waves, which carry negative angular momentum. Before the surface layers are despun to synchronous rotation, the gravity waves propagate to just below the photosphere where they suffer radiative damping and are partially reflected. It is here that the negative angular momentum is deposited and the primary tidal despinning takes place. The surface layers cannot be spun down below synchronous rotation because as a train of gravity waves approaches a corotation resonance its group velocity and wavelength tend to zero, its amplitude diverges, and it is completely absorbed. Thus, tidal despinning to synchronous rotation proceeds from the outside toward the inside of the star.
