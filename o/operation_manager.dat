25|$|Creativity-relevant skills (ability to {{concentrate}} on a problem {{for long periods of}} time, to abandon unproductive searches, and to temporarily put aside stubborn problems). The ability to put aside stubborn problems is referred to by Jex & Britt as productive forgetting. Creativity-relevant skills also require the individual contributor to evaluate a problem from multiple vantage points. One must be able to take on the perspective of various users. For example, an <b>Operation</b> <b>Manager</b> analyzing a reporting issue and developing an innovative solution would consider the perspective of a sales person, assistant, finance, compensation, and compliance officer.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} that there is a natural tension between <b>operations</b> <b>managers</b> and management accountants. This tension is particularly evident when decisions are being made about process change. Semi-structured interviews with 40 <b>operations</b> <b>managers</b> revealed that accountants were only involved in about half of change processes. Surprisingly this proportion was the same for both continuous and radical change programmes despite the latter involving greater risk and capital investment. Six case studies were then used to identify the factors which underpin the degree of involvement where there was close interaction between accountants and <b>operations</b> <b>managers.</b> The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications for <b>operations</b> <b>managers</b> and some suggestions for further research...|$|R
