25|$|On 11 February 1858, Soubirous {{went with}} her sisters Toinette and Jeanne Abadie to collect some {{firewood}} and bones in order to buy some bread. After taking <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes</b> and stockings to wade through the water near the Grotto of Massabielle, she said she {{heard the sound of}} two gusts of wind (coups de vent) but the trees and bushes nearby did not move. A wild rose in a natural niche in the grotto, however, did move.|$|E
25|$|After {{a chance}} meeting with George Reisner's secretary, who commented on her {{apparent}} ability to charm snakes {{and told her}} that spells on such powers were in early ancient Egyptian literature, Omm Sety visited the Fifth Dynasty pyramid of Unas. Klaus Baer recalled her piety when she accompanied him on a visit to Sakkara in the early 1950s, when she brought an offering and took <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes</b> before entering Unas' pyramid. She continued to report apparitions and out-of-body experiences during this time, which caused friction with the upper-middle-class family she had married into.|$|E
25|$|One {{persistent}} rumor {{was especially}} prevalent in Europe; fake news circulated that Shirley {{was not a}} child but a 30-year-old dwarf {{due in part to}} her stocky body type. The rumor was so prevalent that the Vatican dispatched Father Silvio Massante to investigate if she were indeed a child. The fact that she never seemed to miss any teeth led some people to conclude that she had all her adult teeth. Temple was actually losing her teeth regularly through her days with 20th Century Fox, most notably during the sidewalk ceremony in front of Grauman's Theatre, where she took <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes</b> and placed her bare feet in the cement to take attention away from her face. When acting, she wore dental plates and caps to hide the gaps in her teeth. Another rumor pertaining to her teeth was the idea that they were filed to make them appear like baby teeth.|$|E

50|$|A prostitute was forgiven by Allah, because, {{passing by}} a panting dog near a well and {{seeing that the}} dog was about to die of thirst, she took <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoe,</b> and tying it with her head-cover she drew out some water for it. So, Allah forgave her because of that.|$|R
5000|$|One day {{on her way}} {{to school}} a big dog comes after Ramona, so she takes <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoe</b> and throws it at him. The dog picks up <b>her</b> <b>shoe</b> and carries it away, forcing Ramona to limp her way back to school. That {{turns out to be the}} morning Mrs. Griggs finally chooses Ramona to lead the morning flag salute, and Mrs. Griggs discovers that Ramona is only wearing one <b>shoe.</b> Ramona uses <b>her</b> {{ingenuity}} to deal with the situation, and when <b>her</b> <b>shoe</b> is returned, the school secretary compliments her bravery, resulting in her nickname [...] "the Brave".|$|R
500|$|Dr. Sanjay Gupta guest starred {{as himself}} in [...] "Black Light Attack!"; Liz {{is at home}} and watches Dr. Gupta on CNN as he expounds about the rise in female libido before menopause, {{referred}} to as the [...] "Dirty 30s". This was actor Cheyenne Jackson's third appearance as Danny on 30 Rock. He made his debut in the November 12, 2009, episode [...] "The Problem Solvers", and would later guest star on [...] "Secret Santa". Series' creator, executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey had seen Jackson in the Broadway musicals Xanadu and Damn Yankees, the latter that starred Jane Krakowski, who plays Jenna on the show. According to Jackson in a November 2009 interview, Fey set up a meeting to interest him in a role on the program. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, it was revealed that it was Krakowski who brought Jackson {{to the attention of the}} 30 Rock producers. While at the Knicks game, Danny reveals details to Jack, about the woman he is seeing, such as [...] "She never takes <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes...</b> Even though the reason is she's never let a man see her feet", which is a real life trait of Fey's and her character.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] {{live for}} the first time the 2011 Glastonbury Festival on June 26, 2011. During the performance she danced with her male backup dancers and the official video of the song was played on a screen behind them. Later, in May 2012, Beyoncé performed a funky version of the song as a part of her revue show [...] in Atlantic City, New Jersey at Revel. While reviewing the show, Ben Ratliff of The New York Times wrote: [...] "Then she makes some of the most thorough and gold-plated declarations of self-worth ever rendered in pop. 'There’s nothing not to love about me,' she sang... without needing to make a joke out of it." [...] Maura Johnston of The Village Voice was also positive about the performance of the song, saying, [...] "Live, she threw herself into the track, from tsk-tsk-tsk opening to impassioned ending; after that, the song's frenetic beat got transformed into an extended outro that showcased her band's prowess in such a convincing way, she took <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes</b> to dance along with it." [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] was included in the set list of Beyoncé's The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour (2013-2014).|$|E
2500|$|In 1976, Grant {{wrote her}} first song ("Mountain Man"), {{performed}} in {{public for the}} first time at Harpeth Hall School, the all-girls school she attended in Nashville. She recorded a demo tape for her parents with church youth-leader Brown Bannister. When Bannister was dubbing a copy of the tape, Chris Christian, the owner of the recording studio, heard the demo and called Word Records. He played it over the phone, and she was offered a recording contract, five weeks before her 16th birthday. In 1977, she recorded her first album titled Amy Grant, produced by Brown Bannister, who would also produce her next 11 albums. It was released in early 1978, one month before her high-school graduation. Toward the end of 1978 she performed her first ticketed concert after beginning her first year at Furman University. In May 1979, while at the album-release party for her second album, My Father's Eyes, Grant met Gary Chapman, who had written the title track and would become her first husband. [...] Grant and Chapman toured together in mid-1979. In late 1980, she transferred to Vanderbilt University, where she was a member of the sorority Kappa Alpha Theta. Grant then made a few more albums before dropping out of college to pursue a career in music—Never Alone, followed by a pair of live albums in 1981 (In Concert and In Concert Volume Two), both backed by an augmented edition of the DeGarmo & Key band. It was during these early shows that Grant also established one of her concert trademarks: performing barefoot. To date, Grant continues to take <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes</b> midway through performances, as she has said [...] "it is just more comfortable." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Never mind, I can undress in the dark. I'm used to it." [...] She {{loosened}} {{the collar}} of her dress, slipped <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes,</b> {{and lay down on}} the bed bitter and rebellious.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd bet {{a cookie}} on it," [...] said Cap'n Bill, so Trot came ashore and took <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes</b> and {{stockings}} and laid {{them on the}} log to dry, while the sailor-man resumed {{his work on the}} raft.|$|E

60|$|He {{tried to}} hold her, but she pushed him aside. She stood up. She began to take off her dress. She kicked <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes</b> and slid the {{stockings}} off her feet, then she slipped on her old Mother Hubbard.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not without}} great fear and {{trepidation}} that little Nell slipped <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes</b> and gliding through the store-room of old curiosities, where Mr Brass--the ugliest piece of goods in all the stock--lay sleeping on a mattress, passed into her own little chamber.|$|E
60|$|For a {{time the}} two women kept on travelling, but after five miles Bertha was {{compelled}} to stop and take <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes</b> altogether. For two miles further she refused the offers to carry her, but at last was forced to own that she could go no further.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} Faith stated in horror. This was terrible. Here {{was a little}} girl, almost a neighbour, half frozen because she had no shoes or {{stockings}} in this cruel spring weather.

While serving the customers, Ahn-chae met three ruffians who tried to tease her. Ahn-chae gave a nasty reply when the ruffians suggested to date with her.|$|R

60|$|She hurriedly took <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes</b> and stockings-how delicious the cool, soft velvet of the grass!-and {{sitting down}} on the bank under the great basswood, whose roots formed an abrupt bank, she slid her poor blistered, chafed feet into the water, her bare head leaned against the huge tree trunk.|$|E
60|$|I {{was walking}} in the garden with Ada when I was told that some one wished to see me.

60|$|To-day {{she climbed}} the fence in the lane, just where the rickety wooden bridge crossed the brook, {{and at once}} sat down upon the grassy bank and took <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes</b> and stockings. Then, wearing her sun-bonnet to shield her face from the sun, she stepped softly into the brook and stood {{watching}} the cool water rush by her legs.|$|E
60|$|It did {{not take}} the castaways long to reach the shore, you may be sure. The yellow hen flew to the sands at once, but Dorothy had to climb over the high slats.

50|$|The robbers {{first took}} the large {{treasure}} objects placed around {{the remains of}} Empress Dowager Cixi, such as jadeite watermelons, grasshoppers and vegetables, jade lotus and coral. They snatched objects found beneath the body and ravaged the corpse itself, taking her imperial robe; tearing <b>off</b> <b>her</b> undergarments, <b>shoes</b> and socks, and taking all the pearls and jewels on her body. The looters even pried open her jaws and took the rare pearl from her mouth. Ultimately, they looted the objects under the coffin that had been favorites of Cixi when she was alive.|$|R

60|$|I {{suppose there}} is nothing pride can so little bear with as pride itself, {{and that she was}} punished for her {{imperious}} manner. Her retaliation was the most singular I could have imagined. She remained perfectly still until the carriage had turned into the drive, and then, without the least discomposure of countenance, slipped <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes,</b> left them on the ground, and walked deliberately in the same direction through the wettest of the wet grass.|$|E
60|$|Louise rose {{upright on}} the lounge, {{where she had}} thrown herself, after dinner, to rest, in the dim light, and think over the day's strange experience, {{and stared at him}} helplessly. For her greater ease and comfort, she had pushed <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes,</b> and they had gone over the foot of the lounge. She found herself confronted with the contumacious-looking workman she had noticed at the station in Hatboro', with those thin, mocking lips, and the large, dreamy eyes that she remembered.|$|E
5000|$|For example, she narrated a {{story about}} eating a {{hamburger}} in a restaurant and feeling something hard in it. She spat it out and found it was white and looked like a toenail, and she said: [...] "I thought I was gonna die. I mean, what was a toenail doing in my hamburger?". Then {{she went to the}} restroom and, on the way, she saw Princess Lee Radziwill whom she described as the: [...] "classy lady that no one knows where she's the princess of." [...] However, what the Princess didn't know was that she had a tiny piece of toilet paper hanging <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoe,</b> and she was walking around and the toilet paper hadn't fallen off. [...] "I thought I was gonna be sick. So I said to her, 'Hey Princess Lee — what are ya tryin' to do, make me sick?'. Jane Curtin then asked her what this had to do with anything, and Roseannadanna replied: [...] "Well {{it just goes to show}} you, it's always something, you either got a toenail in your hamburger or toilet paper clinging to your shoe." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{was amused}} by the elaborateness with which he didn't glance at her while she took <b>off</b> <b>her</b> low <b>shoes</b> and slipped <b>her</b> quite too thin black {{stockings}} under the protecting tin cowl.

His sisters don't even have limbs. But do fairies have sisters? He is a fairy. When I'm out of the mud he'll turn his raincoat {{into a pair of}} lordly white wings, and vanish. But what will become of the cat?" ...|$|R
60|$|Ferry with them, {{and were}} good-natured to the last, having shaken hands all round with the waiters, chambermaids, and porters of the hotel. The young {{fellow with the}} bad amiable face came in a calash, and refused to overpay the driver with a gay {{decision}} that made him Basil's envy till he saw his tribulation in getting the troupe's luggage checked. There were forty pieces, and it always remained a mystery, considering {{the small amount of}} clothing necessary to those people on the stage, what could have filled their trunks. The young man and the two English blondes of American birth found places in the same car with our tourists, and enlivened the journey with their frolics. When the young man pretended to fall asleep, they wrapped his golden curly head in a shawl, and vexed him with many thumps and thrusts, till he bought a brief truce with a handful of almonds; and the ladies having no other way to eat them, one of them saucily snatched <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoe,</b> and cracked them hammerwise with the heel. It was all so pleasant that it ought to have been all right; and in their merry world of outlawry perhaps things are not so bad as we like to think them.|$|R
