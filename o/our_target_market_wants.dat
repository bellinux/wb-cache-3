40|$|Increasing {{demand for}} {{implementing}} highly-miniaturized battery-powered ultra-low-cost systems (e. g., below 1 USD) in emerging {{applications such as}} body, urban life and environment monitoring, etc., has introduced many challenges in the chip design. Such applications require high performance occasionally, but very little energy consumption {{during most of the}} time in order to extend battery lifetime. In addition, they require real-time guarantees. The most suitable technological solution for those devices consists of using hybrid processors able to operate at: (i) high voltage to provide high performance and (ii) near-/sub-threshold (NST) voltage to provide ultra-low energy consumption. However, the most efficient SRAM memories for each voltage level differ and it is mandatory trading off different SRAM designs, especially in cache memories, which occupy most of the processor¿s area. In this Thesis, we analyze the performance/power tradeoffs involved in the design of SRAM L 1 caches for reliable hybrid high and NST Vcc operation from a microarchitectural perspective. We develop new, simple, single-Vcc domain hybrid cache architectures and data management mechanisms that satisfy all stringent needs of <b>our</b> <b>target</b> <b>market.</b> Proposed solutions are shown to have high energy efficiency with negligible impact on average performance while maintaining strong performance guarantees as required for <b>our</b> <b>target</b> <b>market.</b> Postprint (published version...|$|R

We began by conducting both secondary and primary research, developing key insights and examining all possible target audiences. We investigated the day-to-day life of the visually impaired, learning that many who have experienced vision loss suffer from decreasing independence and increasing feelings of loneliness. Our primary research revealed that these individuals turn first to eye care professionals, resource organizations for the visually impaired and residential healthcare facilities to seek practical and medical assistance with blindness.

One approach to answering such questions requires operationalization of one of the various multi-attribute attitude models where belief assessments of objects (e. g., brands, suppliers, etc.) on determinant attributes (e. g., order filled accurately; product delivered by date agreed upon; sales rep welcomes small volume orders) are examined in relation to relative importance judgments of the salient/determinant attributes. Regardless of approach taken, business marketers and their research staff normally establish the set of attributes deemed salient or determinant by the <b>target</b> <b>market</b> by conducting a preliminary research project. We contend that this step is taken too lightly, to the point that those attributes posited as being salient/determinant at best represent an incomplete listing.

In six short years aboriginal tourism has doubled from a $ 20 million dollar segment in 2006 to a $ 42 million dollar segment in 2012. It's no wonder a planned growth initiative is being spearheaded by Aboriginal Tourism BC and the provincial government. Expectations are ten percent annually, totally $ 68 million in 2017.

The rationale behind this school-wide concept is that in Hungary, where its implementation is currently in progress, gaining a PhD automatically means becoming an academic. However, there is a significant demand amongst high-performing professional practitioners, who are not inclined to become academics, for further learning opportunities at the highest level. They are <b>our</b> <b>target</b> <b>market.</b> We also wish to respond to one of the current challenges the academy is globally facing globally, namely to maintain the highest scholarly standard while achieving high relevance for practice. The school-wide concept that can adequately engage with both of these problems is naturally a work-based one. Thus what we outline here is a professional doctorate in a school-wide context. We frame this new approach based on three principles: Popper’s tentative problem solving process, Nicolescu’s method of transdisciplinarity, and Bourdieu’s approach to reflexivity. From these three principles we have synthesised a transdisciplinary tentative process of creative problem solving, which is both reflexive and reflective. We bring this process into the foreground and build a knowledge landscape in the background. The taught components (content) of the knowledge landscape are delivered by the disciplines involved in the form of high-level meta-knowledge. Since there are two focal dimensions of the programme content, we label it bifocal. The enquiring practitioners, who are also passionate learners, will make their journey through the professional doctoral school. They will follow their own transdisciplinary tentative processes of creative problem solving in this bifocal knowledge landscape, which is composed of taught components and additional elements that are to be discovered or created in the community of New Alexandrians...|$|R

For small companies, all of these functions could be carried out by one or a few people within the company. However, typically, in large companies, these functions are divided into different groups/teams of people, and each individual is focused on a few specific tasks. With the main domains of design, product development, merchandising, and marketing in mind, the role of global sourcing in research and education with each of these functions is explored next.|$|R

The company has established operations in 54 countries within six continents, and is currently the largest fertilizer company in the world. Although Yara is already well-established in several countries, they are still looking take advantage of new international opportunities. The goal of this thesis has therefore been to take a deeper look at the Cambodian agricultural market, {{in order to identify}} opportunities for Yara’s expansion, as well as develop a plan for entry.

On the topic of business strategy, we recommended a differentiation strategy, targeting high-end customers, and offering the existing product portfolio...|$|R
40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY For {{more than}} a century jcpenney has been a {{dependable}} retailer and a regular shopping destination for the American family. Founded in 1902 by James Cash Penney, the department store was established on the principle of the golden rule. Throughout the years they have developed a reputation for putting their customers first and providing them with their everyday needs. However, in the minds of {{women between the ages of}} 25 - 34, the image of jcpenney has not been consistent. For a demographic so interested in fashion, these women prefer to do most of their shopping in specialty clothing stores and small boutiques. We’ve come to understand <b>our</b> <b>target</b> <b>market’s</b> rationale when deciding where to shop. Atmosphere, style, and brands are essential components of an enjoyable shopping experience. Women want to purchase styles that are on the forefront of the runway. We believe the jcpenney marketing strategy needs a fresh change to better connect with this demographic. The perception of jcpenney fashion will change in the minds of these women with an emphasis on quality, brand names, and digital technology. The addition of the jcp boutique will provide them with exclusive designer brands and enhance their overall shopping experience. These changes will be communicated using traditional and non-traditional media that will direct that market to innovative digital strategies. This campaign will give jcpenney the tools it needs to become a fashion destination, in line with the goals of jcpenney CEO Myron Ullman who said himself, “We have centered the merchandising leadership at jcpenney in a way that will allow us to best focus our efforts on confirming jcpenney as a style destination. ” jcpenney is “Ready for Change. ” We believe women will be excited to see the bold, new changes that jcpenney is making. Most importantly, this campaign will make great strides in helping jcpenney become a style destination...|$|R
