Instead, they flew from Los Angeles to Qatar, via Washington and London. While the cable said that Mansoori was currently under investigation, U.S. law enforcement officials {{said that there was}} no active investigation <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>or</b> of the Qatari citizens mentioned in the cable.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} an {{instance}} may be that of an employee presenting to their co-workers. During the presentation, the person may stutter a word, upon {{which he or she}} may worry that other people significantly noticed and think that their perceptions <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>or</b> her as a presenter have been tarnished. This cognitive thought propels further anxiety which compounds with further stuttering, sweating, and, potentially, a panic attack.|$|E
25|$|Once in orbit, the {{spacecraft}} could be rotated in three directions: along its longitudinal axis (roll), {{left to right}} from the astronaut's point of view (yaw), and up or down (pitch). Movement was created by rocket-propelled thrusters which used hydrogen peroxide as a fuel. For orientation, the pilot could look through the window in front <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>or</b> from a screen connected to a periscope which could be turned 360°.|$|E

25|$|In 1947, a {{psychologist}} named Ross Stagner asked {{a number of}} personnel managers to take a personality test. After they had taken the test, Stagner, instead of responding with feedback based on their actual individual answers, presented each of them with generalized feedback that had no relation to their test answers but that was, instead, based on horoscopes, graphological analyses, and the like. Each of the managers was then asked how accurate the assessment <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>or</b> her was. More than half described the assessment as accurate, and almost none described it as wrong.|$|E
25|$|Francia {{took several}} {{precautions}} against assassination. He would lock the Palace doors himself, unroll the cigars his sister made to ensure {{there was no}} poison, prepare his own yerba mate, and sleep with a pistol under his pillow. Even so, a maid tried to poison him {{with a piece of}} cake. No one could come within six paces <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> <b>or</b> even bear a cane near him. Whenever he would go out riding, he had all bushes and trees along the route uprooted so that assassins could not hide; all shutters had to be closed, and pedestrians had to prostrate before him as he passed.|$|E
25|$|On June 20, 2012, Aguiar's 31-foot, {{center console}} Jupiter boat, named the T.T. Zion, landed on Fort Lauderdale Beach east of East Las Olas Boulevard around 1:15a.m., with its {{navigation}} lights on and engines still running, {{according to the}} Sun-Sentinel. Sea Tow, the company that Fort Lauderdale authorities contracted to tow the boat, said that the vessel appeared seaworthy and did not believe a mechanical problem had occurred. Aguiar's wallet and cell phone were found on board, but no sign <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>or</b> any other passenger was found. Authorities on ATVs searched {{up and down the}} beach, but found no sign of Aguiar. The Coast Guard commenced a search at sea. A search of his house found that his watch and wedding band had been left behind. In July 2012 and June 2013, the Ft. Lauderdale Police Department said that even though the investigation remains open, there have been no significant leads in the case.|$|E

500|$|The first essay, [...] "On Face-work", {{discusses}} {{the concept of}} face, which is the positive self-image that an individual holds when interacting with others. Goffman believes that face [...] "as a sociological construct of interaction, is neither inherent in nor a permanent aspect of the person". Once an individual offers a positive self-image <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>or</b> herself to others, that individual feels a need to maintain and {{live up to that}} image. Inconsistency in how a person projects him or herself in society risks embarrassment and discrediting. Therefore, people remain guarded, to ensure that they do not show themselves to others in an unfavorable light.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the primary}} reasons for the {{separation}} from Providence was dissension over admitting Samuel Gorton and his Warwick friends to equal rights in Providence. [...] After being evicted from other places, Gorton attempted {{to join in the}} Providence government, but the Pawtuxet settlers wanted no part <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>or</b> his followers. [...] One cause of dissatisfaction was Gorton's treatment of the Indians. [...] Arnold felt a strong affinity towards the Narragansett people, having acquired their language, and he accused Gorton and the other Warwick settlers of showing injustice to the Indians in a long letter to Governor John Winthrop of Massachusetts in 1648.|$|E
500|$|Through threadbare clues and supposition, mostly centred {{around a}} {{relatively}} wealthy couple that perished during a plague, {{believed to be}} his parents, Lochner {{is thought to have}} come from Meersburg, near Lake Constance. Georg and Alhet Lochner were citizens and died there in 1451. A [...] "Stefan" [...] is referred to as [...] "Stefan Lochner of Constance" [...] in two documents dated 1444 and 1448. However, there is no archival evidence that he was there, and his style bears no trace of the art in that region. There are no further records <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>or</b> his family in the town except for a mention of Lochners (a fairly uncommon name) in the village of Hagnau, two kilometers from Meersburg.|$|E

500|$|In {{the book}} I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood {{characterized}} the episode as [...] "a good {{twist on the}} never-ending Krusty story" [...] and suggested that while [...] "Jay Leno turns in a nice cameo [...] the show is stolen by the advert for the Canyonero". The authors also praised Krusty's [...] "ponytail and black sweater" [...] look. In the DVD audio commentary for [...] "The Last Temptation of Krust", Leno said that he believed the essence of comedy clubs was depicted {{very well in the}} episode and referred to Krusty's remodeled appearance as [...] " [...] Carlin post-Vegas act". He also appreciated Krusty's poke at Leno's use of news headlines on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and said that he could not figure out whether parts of the episode were making fun <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>or</b> complimenting him. William Irwin's [...] references a scene from the episode as an example of Marge's passive resistance, her moral influence on Lisa, and her value as a role model for her children.|$|E
500|$|George's {{last years}} {{were marked by}} {{increasing}} physical and mental decay and withdrawal from public affairs. Privately a senior aide to the King confided to his diary: [...] "A more contemptible, cowardly, selfish, unfeeling dog does not exist... There have been good and wise kings but not many of them... and this I believe {{to be one of}} the worst." [...] On his death The Times captured elite opinion succinctly: [...] "There never was an individual less regretted by his fellow-creatures than this deceased king. What eye has wept for him? What heart has heaved one throb of unmercenary sorrow?... If he ever had a friend – a devoted friend in any rank of life – we protest that the name <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>or</b> her never reached us." [...] George IV was described as the [...] "First Gentleman of England" [...] on account of his style and manners. He possessed many good qualities; he was bright, clever, and knowledgeable. However, his laziness and gluttony led him to squander much of his talent. The Times wrote, he would always prefer [...] "a girl and a bottle to politics and a sermon".|$|E
500|$|According to Rimsky-Korsakov, {{the other}} members of the Five showed little enthusiasm for the symphony, and less still for the quartet. Nor was his public debut as a conductor, at an 1874 charity concert where he led the {{orchestra}} in the new symphony, considered favorably by his compatriots. He later wrote that [...] "they began, indeed, to look down upon me as one on the downward path". Worse still to Rimsky-Korsakov was the faint praise given by Anton Rubinstein, a composer opposed to the nationalists' music and philosophy. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that after Rubinstein heard the quartet, he commented that now Rimsky-Korsakov [...] "might amount to something" [...] as a composer. He wrote that Tchaikovsky continued to support him morally, telling him that he fully applauded what Rimsky-Korsakov was doing and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character. Privately, Tchaikovsky confided to Nadezhda von Meck, [...] "Apparently [...] is now passing through this crisis, and how it will end will be difficult to predict. Either a great master will come out <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> <b>or</b> he will finally become bogged down in contrapuntal tricks".|$|E

2500|$|A pair of 2005 Associated Press {{articles}} by Candice Choi on the infomercials elaborated {{on the success}} and problems of the programs. Choi says that by repeatedly mentioning government sanctions against him, Trudeau [...] "anticipated any backlash with his cuckoo conspiracy theory" [...] and can partially deflect any criticism <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>or</b> his infomercials. Trudeau's {{use of the word}} [...] "cure" [...] is an issue for regulators. Also, bookstores are polled on their decisions to sell or not sell a successful and controversial self-published book.|$|E
2500|$|On January 14, 2010, Hopper {{filed for}} divorce from his fifth wife Victoria Duffy.

50|$|Occasionally {{the first}} {{question}} tabled is on a specific area of policy, not the engagements question.
