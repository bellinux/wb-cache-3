5|$|In February 1918 General Mannerheim {{weighed the}} {{question}} <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> focus the general offensive of the Whites, between two strategically vital enemy strongholds: Tampere, Finland's major industrial {{town in the}} south-west, and Viipuri, Karelia's main city. Although seizing Viipuri offered major advantages, the lack of combat skills of his army and potential for a major counterattack by the enemy in the area or in the south-west made it too risky.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{this left}} open the {{question}} <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> locate the capital. Initially the Bombala {{district in the}} far south of NSW was proposed, to which southern Monaro, (which incorporated Bombala), Orange and Yass were soon added. The NSW Premier, John See, offered to provide {{any of the three}} recommended sites as a future capital territory. Edmund Barton, the first Prime Minister of the new Federal Government, added another four sites to this list: Albury, Tamworth, Armidale and Tumut, and members of the new government toured the various sites in 1902. The tour proved inconclusive, and upon their return the members decided to refer the problem to a Royal Commission, with the Minister for Home Affairs, William Lyne, pushing for Tumut or Albury as he preferred a site in his electorate. Subsequently, the Commission presented its report to Parliament in 1903, recommending the sites of Albury, Tumut and Orange, in that order. However, there continued to be problems, as the House of Representatives backed the Tumut option, while the Senate preferred the town of Bombala. As a result of this disagreement the bill lapsed, and it was left to the second Parliament to choose a location for the capital.|$|E
5|$|With his {{contract}} set to expire after the 2007 season, Rivera sought an extension with the Yankees during spring training. Team management refused to negotiate near {{the start of}} the season, prompting him to respond that he would consider free agency {{at the end of the}} year. In April, Rivera blew his first two save opportunities, compiled two losses, and surrendered nine earned runs in innings pitched. Concerned sportswriters attributed his struggles to infrequent use, as the Yankees presented him with few situations to enter a game. Rivera saved 30 of his next 32opportunities and posted a 2.26ERA over the final five months of the season. In addition, he passed John Franco for third place on the all-time saves list with his 425th career save. Still, Rivera finished 2007 with closer career worsts in earned runs (25), hits (68), and ERA (3.15), and his 30saves in 34opportunities were his second-lowest total since 1997. After the Yankees were eliminated from the playoffs in the opening round, Rivera stated his intentions to test the free agent market. He initially indicated that his decision <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> sign would be influenced by whether long-time manager Joe Torre was re-signed. Although Torre did not return, Rivera remained with the Yankees by agreeing to a three-year, $45million contract, making him the highest-paid reliever in baseball history.|$|E

25|$|Most {{residence}} halls {{are much}} closer to campus than comparable private housing such as apartment buildings. This convenience {{is a major factor}} in the choice <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> live since living physically closer to classrooms is often preferred, particularly for first-year students who may not be permitted to park vehicles on campus.

25|$|The September 11 {{attacks in}} 2001 {{had a major}} impact on Battery Park City. The {{residents}} of lower Manhattan and particularly of Battery Park City were displaced {{for an extended period of}} time.

Many of the displaced residents were not allowed to return to the area for months and none were given government guidance <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> live temporarily on the already crowded island of Manhattan. With most hotel rooms booked, residents, including young children and the elderly were forced to fend for themselves.|$|E
25|$|The board {{also wanted}} to {{introduce}} ten-minute headway and, unlike the other routes, remove the conductor. It was also decided to build the terminus at Ankers gate, based on studies {{of the number of}} people walking past each station. The city engineer consequently recommended building double track along the whole line. The city council approved building the line on 28 October 1926, but without double track all the way. However, the decision <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> place the terminal stop in the city was delayed. In the end, the board voted to build the line to the railway station, in part because the calculations of extra costs were not documented well enough.|$|E
25|$|When teams start a leg, {{arrive at}} Route Markers, or {{complete}} certain tasks, they normally receive a letter-sized tear-away envelope that contains their next clue inside a vertical-fold folder. The clues themselves are typically printed on a vertical strip of paper, although additional information is often provided inside the clue folder. After retrieving the clue, teams open {{the envelope and}} read aloud the instructions given on the clue sheet and then follow those instructions. Teams are generally required to collect each clue during each leg and keep that information with them until they reach the next Pit Stop, surrendering them once they have checked in. Teams may not take an additional clue from the clue box should they lose their first one, otherwise they are assessed a penalty. Teams are not directly penalized for misplacing their clue but will lose time either searching for it or trying to learn from other teams <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> go next.|$|E

Further about the 2013 research, 30.9% of those studying in public schools were already sexually initiated, versus 18% in private ones; 24.7% of sexually initiated adolescents did not use a condom in their most recent sexual activity (22.9% of boys, 28.2% of girls), in spite of at the school environment 89.1% of them receiving orientation about STDs, 69.7% receiving orientation <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> acquire condoms for free (as part of a public health campaign from the Brazilian government) and 82.9% had heard of other forms of contraceptive methods.|$|E
25|$|Zheng's game is characterised by consistency, intellect, quick {{reflexes}} {{and fighting}} spirit. She {{is not the}} strongest player, but makes up for this with her careful thinking <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> place her shots and willingness to change game plans if a strategy is not working. Her shots are {{of a lot of}} pace and very well placed, making Zheng an excellent defensive counterpuncher. She has one of the best footwork and court coverage on the tour, which allows her to keep shots in play that would normally be winners; so few shots get by her that after the final match of 2005 Hobart International, the finalist Gisela Dulko described her game as 'The Great Wall of China' because 'she didn't miss one ball'. Also an accomplished doubles player, she is very comfortable when playing at the net. Zheng's best shot is her backhand. Zheng's main weakness is her serve; however she is sometimes able to neutralize her weak serve with her quickness or by serving to the body or to the opponent's weaker groundstroke.|$|E

[...] Desbouvrie refused to make public disclosure of what he fed the birds in wintertime and regarded that as a trade secret. [...] Later attempts to train homing behavior into migratory birds determined that the birds have no instinctive knowledge <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> fly when the season changes, so if the normal migratory pattern is disrupted during the first year of life the individual does not migrate afterward.|$|E
500|$|The issue <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> {{locate the}} colony's capital caused {{the first in}} a series of rifts between Winthrop and Dudley.

[...] At the boundary between their lands, a pair of boulders were named the Two Brothers [...] "in remembrance that they were brothers by their children's marriage".

500|$|American Idiot is {{a concept}} album that {{describes}} {{the story of a}} central character named Jesus of Suburbia, an anti-hero created by Billie Joe Armstrong. It is written {{from the perspective of a}} lower-middle-class suburban American teen, raised on a diet of [...] "soda pop and Ritalin." [...] Jesus of Suburbia hates his town and those close to him, so he leaves for the city. The second character introduced in the story is St. Jimmy, a [...] "swaggering punk rock freedom fighter par excellence." [...] Whatsername, [...] "a 'Mother Revolution' figure," [...] is introduced as a nemesis of St. Jimmy in the song [...] "She's a Rebel". The album's story is largely indeterminate, as the group was unsure <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> lead the plot's third quarter. In this sense, Armstrong decided to leave the ending up to the listeners' imagination. The two secondary characters exemplify the record's main theme—"rage versus love"—in that while St. Jimmy is driven by [...] "rebellion and self-destruction," [...] Whatsername is focused on [...] "following your beliefs and ethics." [...] Jesus of Suburbia eventually decides to follow the latter, resulting in the figurative suicide of St. Jimmy, which is revealed to be a facet of his personality. In the album's final song, Jesus of Suburbia loses his connection with Whatsername as well, to the point in which he can't even remember her name.|$|E
