50|$|In 1869 the First Transcontinental Railroad was {{completed}} in the United States. This development reduced passenger and freight traffic across the isthmus and diminished the amount of gold and silver shipped east. During {{the height of the}} gold rush, however, from 1855 to 1858, only one-tenth of the <b>ordinary</b> commercial <b>freight</b> was destined for or originated in California. The balance concerned trade of the North Americans with Europe and Asia. The railroad company, because of its exceptionally high return on a capitalization that never exceeded US$7 million, paid a total of nearly US$38 million in dividends between 1853 and 1905. Panama received US$25,000 from Colombia's annuity and benefited from transient trade and some inflow of capital.|$|R
50|$|When {{the depot}} was built, Antwerp {{was the largest}} {{community}} in Paulding County, due to an active logging industry. Accordingly, the depot was built to be larger than most train stations in small northwestern Ohio communities. Inside, the station is divided into several distinct areas: <b>freight,</b> <b>ordinary</b> passengers, mail and express packaging, and internal railroad offices each possess their own rooms. Other than its size, the depot is typical of late nineteenth-century train stations in northwestern Ohio, which frequently served as commercial hubs for their communities.|$|R

[...] There were probably more than 56 lost because several children under fare age were never accounted for. Bad as this was, things could have been much worse, as Clallam had embarked only 92 people (31 crew and 61 passengers) on her last voyage, although she was licensed to carry 250 passengers on <b>ordinary</b> voyages with <b>freight,</b> or 500 on excursions without freight.|$|R
50|$|During the 1950s, {{iron ore}} and lumber {{were the main}} use for the upper section of the line. By 1960, there were two or three weekly pure ore trains in {{addition}} to hopper cars in <b>ordinary</b> <b>freight</b> trains. A new lumber crane was installed at Treungen in 1962, with Hunsfoss Fabrikker stating they would be sending an additional 18 t of lumber. In 1964, a five-year contract was signed with the mine for 44000 t of ore per year, but the following year the mine closed. The same year, only 1000 t of lumber were being sent by the line. There was a 23 percent drop in passenger traffic between 1962 and 1965, to 45,300 people, and the line lost NOK 700,000 that year. During the last years, {{the upper part of}} the line had three daily services with Class 87 trains and three weekly freight trains hauled by Di 2.|$|E
50|$|The SJ Class Rm is an {{electric}} locomotive operated by Swedish State Railways (Statens Järnvägar, SJ) and later Green Cargo. The six locomotives are variants of the Rc locomotive and built by ASEA in 1977. The difference is smaller wheels giving higher pulling force, but lower maximum speed. They {{were used in}} triple-unit configuration on Malmbanan as supplements to Dm3-units, but later moved {{to other parts of}} the Swedish rail network after the transport needs on Malmbanan were reduced. When originally used to haul iron ore they were ballasted, fitted with SA3 couplings and additional set of brakes, but all these modifications were removed when the locomotives were put in <b>ordinary</b> <b>freight</b> operation. In the 1990s they were repainted from orange to blue. When SJ was split up, they were transferred to Green Cargo, stationed in Malmö. In 2013-2014 they were used again for iron ore traffic on Malmbanan. They went between Svappavaara and Narvik for Northland Resources, using SA3 couplings. After the Northland bankruptcy they were parked but will return to service in 2016.|$|E
5000|$|PRC {{authorities}} {{have recently been}} pursuing measures to reduce the official number of crimes punishable by death, and limit how often {{the death penalty is}} officially utilized. Since 2005, China has experienced significant reforms on the death penalty system. In 2011, China abolished the death penalty for 13 crimes in Amendment VIII to the Criminal Law of PRC, which was the most important amendment passed since 1997. The National People's Congress Standing Committee adopted an amendment {{to reduce the number of}} capital crimes from 68 to 55. [...] According to [...] "The Death Penalty in China: Reforms and Its Future", the 13 crimes (19% of the total number of crimes punishable through death) were: [...] "smuggling of cultural relics; smuggling of precious metals; smuggling of precious animals or their products; smuggling of <b>ordinary</b> <b>freight</b> and goods; fraud connected with negotiable instruments; fraud connected with financial instruments; fraud connected with letters of credit; false invoicing for tax purposes; forging and selling value-added tax invoices; larceny; instructing in criminal methods; excavating and robbing ancient cultural sites or ancient tombs, and excavating and robbing fossil hominids and fossil vertebrate animals".|$|E
2500|$|The {{clippers}} that sailed at {{the beginning}} of the 1866/67 tea season had a premium of 10s per ton written into their bills of lading, payable, by the consignees, to the first ship to dock in London. This is additional to the <b>ordinary</b> rate of <b>freight</b> that had been negotiated - in the case of Ariel in 1866, that was £5 per ton. The [...] "ton" [...] used in these bills of lading was the [...] "freight ton", a measurement of volume; British ships loading tea in China at this time used a ton of 50 cubic feet (compared with American ships which used a ton of 40 cubic feet).|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} years {{following}} nationalisation, services on the Norfolk & Suffolk line were busy on summer Saturdays but less patronised at other times when a single push and pull unit hauled by a GER Class M15 or a GER Class G69 sufficed. Reliance on summer traffic was not enough and when British Railways started making losses from 1952 onwards, attention was turned to pruning the network by closing unremunerative lines. Thus in 1953 when major repairs to Breydon Viaduct were required, {{it was decided that}} Lowestoft could be adequately served during the summer season by diverted trains via Norwich Thorpe, and so the <b>ordinary</b> passenger and <b>freight</b> services were withdrawn as from 20 September. A good service nevertheless continued between Yarmouth South Town and Lowestoft, as well as a Saturdays through train from Birmingham. In May 1956, Prince Philip visited Lowestoft to open the new South Pier Pavilion and LNER Thompson Class B1 No. 61399 was used to haul the train from Wickham Market Junction.|$|R
5000|$|Next is {{an excerpt}} from US Commerce Department, 1920. Paraguay. A {{commercial}} handbook.The steamers in the Buenos Aires-Asunción service leave Buenos Aires on Sundays and Thursdays and Asunción on the same days. Four steamers are employed on this run. The upriver trip requires a little over four days and the return about three days. The fares for passage between the two cities are as follows: First class, one way, 110 Argentine pesos ($46.76) round trip, 192.60 pesos ($81.76) second class, one way, 66 pesos ($23.36) round trip, 96.26 pesos ($40.90). The round-trip tickets are valid for three months. The baggage allowance is 50 kilos (110 pounds), but this maximum is liberally interpreted. Accommodations are very comfortable, and in general the trip {{is one of the}} most pleasant that can be made in South America.On the lines north of Asunción fares are higher and accommodations for travelers are poorer. Between Asunción and Buenos Aires the Mihanovich steamers are forced to compete with the international train, but in the Alto Paraguay there is no competition whatever. Stops are more frequent, as the steamers heave to at any estancia house on^he banks where a signal gun is fired or for which there happens to be cargo or passengers. Moreover, the steamers tie up at the shore for two or three hours each day, while enough firewood is taken on to stoke the boilers until another woodpile is reached the next day. This wood costs the company at the rate of 3 centavos gold per stick.Although the service is much inferior to that on the larger Buenos Aires-Asunción steamers, the boats themselves are comfortable and the scenery is more picturesque than in the more low-lying country through which the river flows to the south. The time ordinarily required for the trip between Asunción and some of the more important points on the upper river is as follows : To Concepcion, 40 hours up- stream, 27 hours downstream; Puerto Pinasco, 54 and 33 hours; Bahia Negra, 84 and 77 hours; Porto Esperanga, 90 and 81 hours; Corumba, 96 and 85 hours. The fare to Corumba is 90 gold pesos, or at the rate of over 11 cents per mile. A ticket purchased in Corumba for Asunción costs 495 milreis, which is equivalent to approximately $125, or nearly 17 cents per mile.FREIGHT SERVICE OF THE MIHANOVICH LINK.For fast freight the Mihanovich Co. uses its regular passenger packets, but for most of the <b>ordinary</b> heavy <b>freight</b> it operates a fleet of special cargo steamers, besides tugs for drawing lighters.The Viena was an Inglis product and was launched into the River Kelvin on 8 June 1906. Viena was built for Nicolas Mihanovichs Argentine Navigation Company. Viena was about 330 feet long with a beam of about 40 feet. Her gross tonnage was 2376 and she had accommodation for 340 First Class passengers and 120 in Second Class. The vessel was powered by a triple expansion steam engine built in Inglis own engine works.|$|R
5000|$|Ironton and the {{surrounding}} Hanging Rock region were once among Ohio's most prominent industrial regions, due to extensive deposits of iron ore that were worked in the region's numerous charcoal-fired blast furnaces. For part of this period, land transportation in the region was served by the Scioto Valley Railroad, which enabled the Norfolk and Western Railway {{to gain access to}} the area in 1881 by purchasing the smaller railroad. By this time, industry was transitioning away from traditional iron smelting toward more modern methods of steel manufacturing, requiring the construction of improved trackside facilities in Ironton. As a result, the N&W erected the present station, beginning in 1906 and finishing construction in the following year. While it was built to furnish transportation for industrial purposes, the station also served the city's <b>ordinary</b> <b>freight</b> and passenger traffic needs. Trains ceased using the station when it closed in 1969. [...] Since that time, the depot has been purchased by Ironton's city government, which leases it for commercial purposes; a series of restaurants has operated out of the building since its closure. In preparation for one such occupant, extensive renovations were performed in 2007, including refinishing of the hardwood floors, repairs to the roof, and replacement of older windows.|$|E
5000|$|The chief {{cause of}} the {{downturn}} {{appeared to have been}} loss of operational efficiency. Worker productivity had declined. For example, repair of locomotives was so slow that only about half of the total number were usually operational. Freight car turnaround time had lengthened considerably, and the reported slowness of management to meet growing competition from road transport was also a major factor. A former official in the Sudan train union blamed Gaafar Nimeiry's attempts to crush the unions (who had organised numerous strikes on the railway) by firing 20,000 well qualified employees from 1975-1991. The road system, although generally more expensive, was used increasingly for low-volume, high-value goods because it could deliver more rapidly - 2 or 3 days from Port Sudan to Khartoum, compared with 7 or 8 days for express rail freight and up to two weeks for <b>ordinary</b> <b>freight.</b> In 1982, only one to two percent of freight (and passenger) trains arrived on time. [...] The gradual erosion of freight traffic was evident in the drop from more than 3 million tons carried annually {{at the beginning of the}} 1970s to about 2 million tons at the end of the decade. The 1980s also saw a steady erosion of tonnage as a result of a combination of inefficient management, union intransigence, the failure of agricultural projects to meet production goals, the dearth of spare parts, and the continuing civil war. The bridge at Aweil was destroyed in the 1980s and Wau was without rail access for over 20 years. The line to Wau was reopened in 2010 but Wau became part of South Sudan when it declared independence in 2011. During the civil war in the south (1983-2005) military trains went as far as Aweil accompanied by large numbers of troops and militia, causing great disruption to civilians and humanitarian aid organisations along the railway line.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis is to implement consolidation and collaboration between stakeholders in a local supply chain to improve the economic, social and environmental sustainability aspects of city logistics. The following research question has been developed: “How can consolidation and collaboration between stakeholders in a local supply chain improve the economic, social and environmental sustainability of city logistics?” A case study {{has been used as}} our research strategy since we are investigating a limited geographical area. The study has mainly a deductive approach emphasizing quantification in the collection and analysis of data. Data was obtained through questionnaire distributed to the retailers and transporters operating in the area, and is secondary data provided to us from researchers in Rogaland Fylkeskommune. Our main focus have been to prove the benefits of having all actors involved when implementing new initiatives within city logistics, emphasizing the economic, social and environmental aspect. The developed research models contributes to all three aspect, and reduced impact from freight vehicles were obtained from both. Focusing on consolidation and collaboration in city logistics measures has lead to the decrease of traffic congestion, proven by the reduction in annual deliveries of 27 000. The delivery time for the average transporter have been reduced through consolidating the goods by using a local consolidation centre. Through replacing the 102 <b>ordinary</b> <b>freight</b> vehicles with diesel motors with electric vehicles, an average reduction of 61 kilograms NO 2 per year can be expected...|$|E
