40|$|In {{light of}} the growing {{scarcity}} of petroleum-based raw materials, carbon dioxide (CO 2) is becoming increasing attractive as organic carbon source. In this perspective, formic acid (HCOOH) might be an interesting bio-renewable solution to store, transport, and activate carbon dioxide for the synthesis of value-added chemicals. Herein, HCOOH has been successfully used as C 1 building block for the synthesis of a library of alcohols via a catalysed <b>oxo-synthesis,</b> under green experimental conditions...|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} is {{one kind}} of methanol <b>oxo-synthesis</b> rhodium catalyst with crosslinked porous microspherical polymer as ligand. The polymer is formed with vinyl pyridine and glycol acrylate and through crosslinking copolymerization. The N and O donor atom in the ligand and tetracarbonyl dirhodium dihalide, under the action of sodium tetraphenylborate, form square planar cis-bicarbonyl Rh(I) structure as positive active center. The negative ion is (BPh₄) -. During the methanol carbonylation, the catalyst can convert methanol into acetic acid and acetic anhydride at relatively low temperature and the CO₂producing amount in the reaction system is lower than 0. 005 mol%. 本发明是一种以交联多孔微球形共聚物为配体的甲醇羰基合成铑催化剂。其中共聚物配体由乙烯基吡啶、丙烯酸乙二醇双酯交联共聚形成。利用配体中的N、O授体原子与四羰基二卤二铑在四苯硼钠的作用下，形成Rh(I) 正方平面螯合型顺二羰基正离子活性中心。负离子为(BPh₄) -。在甲醇羰基化反应中，该类催化剂在相对低温条件下(＜ 140 ℃) 即可将甲醇转化为乙酸和乙酸酐，而反应体系中CO₂生成量小于 0. 005 mol％。Department of Applied Biology and Chemical TechnologyInventor name used in this publication: 陈新滋, Chen XinziInventor name used in this publication: 袁国卿, Yuan GuoqinTitle in Traditional Chinese: 催化劑以及製備該催化劑、其配體、乙酸和乙酐的方法Chin...|$|E
30|$|Linear alpha olefins (LAOs) are linear {{hydrocarbons}} {{having a}} double {{bond between the}} first and second carbon atoms. Linear α-olefins have found wide application in various areas of petrochemical synthesis. They are used for copolymerization with ethylene for the purpose of obtaining low- and high-density linear polyethylene and for the preparation of detergents and synthetic lubricants [12, 14, 41, 48, 54, 61, 62]. They can also be used in the production of surfactants, agents for enhanced oil recovery, corrosion inhibitors, high-performance lubricating oils, linear alkylbenzenes, <b>oxo-synthesis</b> alcohols, α-olefin sulfonates, oil additives, and as drilling fluids [1, 3, 6, 28, 35, 51, 59]. The worldwide growth rate of LAOs production between 1980 and 1990 amounted to 10 – 15  wt% per year. From 1990 to 2000, the annual increase in LAO production came to 4.5 – 5  % wt%. Their average annual demand over the next 10 – 15  years is expected to increase by 3.5 wt %. The total amounts of LAOs manufactured worldwide of years 1999, 2003, and 2005 were 2.6, 3.5, and 4.2 million tons, respectively [7].|$|E
40|$|Homogeneous {{catalysts}} are not applied {{often when}} compared to the use of heterogeneous catalysis due to various drawbacks of the usual recovery methods. In this paper, a novel concept is proposed for the integrated recovery and recycling of homogeneous catalysts. It combines an adsorptive separation with the reverse flow technology: reverse flow adsorption. Na+ loaded Amberlyst 15 proved to be one of several suitable adsorbents for the reversible adsorption of homogeneous catalysts. A simplified plug flow model for packed beds showed that the implementation of the reverse flow adsorption concept into an <b>oxo-synthesis</b> process would only require two adsorption beds with a very small relative volume of only 1 % compared to the volume of liquid reaction phase in the reactor. The adsorption temperature, which was chosen to be equal to the reaction temperature, was well within the stability constraints of the homogeneous catalyst and therefore, decomposition of the catalyst is not expected. Reverse flow adsorption is a promising concept that overcomes the drawbacks of the standard recovery methods and therefore, has a high potential to succeed...|$|E
30|$|The large {{consumption}} {{of fossil fuels}} (coal, gas, and oil) within the past decade by rapid industrial growth has brought several environmental problems such as the rising of global warming gases concentration, including CO 2, in air. Recently, the concentration of CO 2 has increased by about 1.5  ppm per year which means if there exists about 5.3  ×  1021 grams air in the atmosphere, the CO 2 increasing rate is about 8 billion tons per year [1, 2, 3]. Therefore, reducing the greenhouse gas emission is becoming very important. Carbon dioxide and methane are both greenhouse gases and are available in large amounts which make them interesting reactants {{for the production of}} synthesis gas. To reduce the emission of the greenhouse gases into the environment, many efforts have been reported by chemical and biological approach [4]. To date, the catalytic dry reforming of methane (DRM) with carbon dioxide to produce synthesis gas (syngas) has been proposed {{as one of the most}} promising technologies to reduce and utilize the CO 2 and also to produce syngas H 2 /CO ratio close to unity which is suitable for methanol, <b>oxo-synthesis</b> and other Fischer–Tropsch syntheses [5, 6, 7, 8].|$|E
