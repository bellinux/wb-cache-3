500|$|Rumors of Stroud's {{homosexuality}} {{were noted}} at Alcatraz. According to Donald Hurley, {{whose father was}} a guard at Alcatraz, [...] "Whenever Stroud was around anyone, which was seldom, he was watched very closely, as prison officials were very aware of his overt homosexual tendencies." [...] In an interview with Hurley for his book, a former inmate heard Stroud was always in 'dog block' (solitary confinement) or later in the hospital {{because he was a}} 'wolf' (aggressive homosexual) who had a bad temper." [...] In February 1963 Stroud met and talked with actor Burt Lancaster, who portrayed him in The Birdman of Alcatraz. Stroud never got to see the film or read the book it was based on but did share on <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> prevented parole, that he was an [...] "admitted homosexual." [...] Lancaster quoted Stroud as saying, [...] "Let's face it, I am 73 years old. Does that answer your question about whether I would be a dangerous homosexual?" ...|$|E
500|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> the All-China Women's Federation has {{identified}} {{is that women}} in China {{do not understand the}} federation’s contributions, or its significance in the women’s movement. [...] The members of the ACWF identified two potential sources for the lack of understanding. The first is that the ACWF has many roles and branch organizations which may be obscuring the contribution it is making. The second is that it has lacked consistency in how it has represented women, especially during its early years. Another problem facing the ACWF is its relationship with the international women’s movement. [...] The relationship between the Marxist view of feminism and current international views on feminism are often viewed as contradictory. Marxism often labels feminist movements as bourgeois because it focuses on the betterment of only one segment of society instead of society as a whole, and states capitalism, not the patriarchy, is the creator of gender inequality. The ACWF struggles with how to engage both, sometimes denying to have borrowed anything from international feminism.|$|E

500|$|At the start, the Confederate Navy faced <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> Mallory had {{encountered}} {{when he was}} chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Naval Affairs: an overabundance of high-ranking officers who were too old to go to sea. This came about because the Confederacy had created its navy by promising that men resigning from the U.S. Navy would enter the CS Navy at their old rank. Hoping to avoid the stagnation that {{was the result of the}} former promotion process, Mallory proposed that promotion should depend solely on [...] "gallant or meritorious conduct during the war." [...] His proposal was quickly made into law by the Confederate Congress. Still not completely satisfied, in 1863 Mallory initiated the creation of a Provisional Navy, which in effect established two officer corps. The officers whom Mallory or his advisers deemed incapable of combat were retained in the Regular Navy, while young and presumably more aggressive officers would transfer to the Provisional Navy. Officers for fighting ships would be drawn from the Provisional Navy, and they could be promoted without regard for seniority if they served with distinction.|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} production, {{what type of}} game it would be became crucial to whether Atlus or Fire Emblem {{developer}} Intelligent Systems would develop it. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> needed to be overcome was {{the form of the}} initial proposal, which was for a simulation game similar to Fire Emblem developed by Atlus. Atlus, who were better known for making traditional role-playing games, were unsure which series to emulate. The decision was eventually made to create {{something along the lines of}} a traditional RPG, so Atlus took on primary development. Their first concept turned out to be a grid-based strategy game with strategic positioning elements similar to Fire Emblem, but they were eventually convinced by Yamagami and staff from Intelligent Systems to keep within their own skillset rather than attempting anything radically different. The final product was visualized as a game only Atlus could make, incorporating elements from both series while standing as an original title that could be enjoyed by fans of both Shin Megami Tensei and Fire Emblem. The game's platform was chosen based on the recent successful Fire Emblem entries for the 3DS: as Fire Emblem had appeared on the 3DS, Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE was to be a different [...] "expression" [...] designed for the Wii U. During these early stages, proposals were also made for a 3DS version, but this never materialized. Despite its ultimate form, some of the conceptual ideas were taken from early plans for Fire Emblem Awakening to take place in a modern-day setting. The inclusion of a sharp symbol in the title, which represents a semitone increase in pitch of a note in musical notation, denoted the game's status as a unique hybrid of the two series. The inclination of the logo was also designed to represent the game's altered perspective on the Fire Emblem series. The game's cutscenes were created by Studio Anima and Studio 4°C.|$|E
500|$|Fielding uses Luckless and The Author's Farce {{to portray}} {{aspects of his}} life, {{including}} his experience with the London theatre community. The plot serves as revenge for the Theatre Royal's rejection of Fielding's earlier plays. However, this and his being forced into minor theatres proved beneficial, because it allowed him more freedom to experiment with his plays {{in ways that would}} have been unacceptable at larger locations. This experimentation, beginning with The Author's Farce, is an attempt by Fielding to try writing in formats beyond the standard five-act comedy play. Though he returned to writing five-act plays later, many of his plays contain plot structures that differ from those common to contemporary plays. To distinguish his satirical intent, Fielding claims that the work was written by [...] "Scriblerus Secundus," [...] which places his play within an earlier literary tradition. The name refers to the Scriblerus Club, a satirical group whose members included Alexander Pope, Jonathan Swift, John Gay, and John Arbuthnot. Fielding's use of the pseudonym connects his play to the satirical writings of the Scriblerus Club's members, and reveals their influence on his new style, such as incorporating in their work the styles of the entertainments that they were ridiculing. Fielding thus allows the audience to believe that he is poking fun at others, less discriminating than themselves, and less able to distinguish good art from bad. Fielding also borrowed characters from the work of the Club's members, such as the Goddess of Nonsense, influenced by Pope's character from The Dunciad, Dulness, who is at war with reason. Nonsense, like Dulness, is a force that promotes the corruption of literature and taste, to which Fielding adds a sexual element. This sexuality is complicated, yet also made comical, when Nonsense chooses a castrated man as her mate. Her choice emphasises a lack of morality, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> Fielding believed dominated 18th-century British society. Despite the link to Dulness, the general satire of the play more closely resembles Gay's Beggar's Opera than the other works produced by the Scriblerus Club.|$|E
