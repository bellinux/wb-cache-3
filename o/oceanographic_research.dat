5|$|In May 1921 {{the policy}} of the Canadian {{government}} towards Arctic expeditions changed with the advent of a new Prime Minister, Arthur Meighen, who withdrew support from Shackleton's proposal. Shackleton was required to rethink his plans, and decided to sail for the Antarctic instead. A varied programme of exploration, coastal mapping, mineral prospecting and <b>oceanographic</b> <b>research</b> in southern waters would replace the abandond Beaufort Sea venture.|$|E
5|$|For {{purposes}} of geophysical and <b>oceanographic</b> <b>research</b> {{and to determine}} habitability, endurance and psychological stress – all extremely important to the Polaris program – it had been decided that a rapid round-the-world trip, touching the areas of interest, should be conducted. Maximum stability of the observing platform and unbroken continuity around the world were important. Additionally, for reasons of the national interest it had been decided that the voyage should be made entirely submerged undetected by our own or other forces and completed as soon as possible. TRITON, because of her size, speed and extra dependability of her two-reactor plant, had been chosen for the mission.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This work shows {{results of}} sound signal {{amplitude}} fluctuation measurements in comparably narrow envelope frequency spectrum interval from 1. 5 to 6. 0 mHz obtained on different stationary tomographic systems- 100 km, 100 Hz in Barentz sea and 320 km, 400 Hz in Okhotsk sea. Use of this range, from {{our point of}} view, in any ocean region allows to decrease influence of two meeting ocean wave processes- surface wind waves from high frequency side and internal as well as long surface waves from low frequency side. This interval according to several previously fulfilled <b>oceanographic</b> <b>researches</b> could be considered as some kind of "transparency windowN for different natural ocean processes responsible for sound fluctuations spectrum. Measurements presented demonstrate such possibility and allow to choose optimal envelope frequency analysis interval for tomographic systems installed in quite different regions. 1...|$|R

25|$|The small-waterplane-area twin hull (SWATH) {{configuration}} reduces wave-generating {{resistance by}} moving displacement volume below the waterline, using {{a pair of}} tubular, submarine-like hulls, connected by pylons to the bridge deck with a narrow waterline cross-section. The submerged hulls are minimally affected by waves. The SWATH form was invented by Canadian Frederick G. Creed, who presented his idea in 1938 and was later awarded a British patent for it in 1946. It was first used in the 1960s and 1970s as an evolution of catamaran design for use as <b>oceanographic</b> <b>research</b> vessels or submarine rescue ships.

25|$|By {{way of his}} voyages in the 1770s, Captain James Cook {{proved that}} waters {{encompassed}} the southern latitudes of the globe. Since then, geographers have disagreed on the Southern Ocean's northern boundary or even existence, considering the waters as {{various parts of the}} Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, instead. However, according to Commodore John Leech of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), recent <b>oceanographic</b> <b>research</b> has discovered the importance of Southern Circulation, and the term Southern Ocean has been used to define the body of water which lies south of the northern limit of that circulation. This remains the current official policy of the IHO, since a 2000 revision of its definitions including the Southern Ocean as the waters south of the 60th parallel has not yet been adopted. Others regard the seasonally-fluctuating Antarctic Convergence as the natural boundary.|$|E

Marion was loaded with supplies and provisions for 70 days of cruising and spare parts for every piece of machinery on board. The complement was increased to two officers, two warrant officers and 23 men; six more than her normal complement. Marion departed Boston, Massachusetts, on 11 July 1928, stopped briefly at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and arrived at Sydney, Nova Scotia, where fuel and water supplies were topped off and 78 drums of fuel were stowed on deck. While at both Halifax and Sydney, Smith consulted local mariners familiar with the Labrador Sea and Davis Strait and updated the ship's charts with information from the mariner's charts.|$|E
