5|$|The Polish {{population}} is historically declining. This is primarily caused by low natural birth rate, assimilation, high intermarriage rate (the majority of Poles live in mixed relationships), and migration to <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> {{as a result}} of job seeking.|$|E
5|$|A devout Wesleyan Methodist, Ferens made {{numerous}} {{charitable donations}} throughout his life. His gifts to Hull include the Ferens Art Gallery and a donation of Â£250,000 {{for the establishment}} of University College (now the University of Hull). He is memorialized in the University's motto: Lampada Ferens. In <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> he made substantial donations to schools, hospitals and charitable organisations.|$|E
5|$|According to polls, {{about one}} out of three Poles say they own a Polish flag, and about {{one out of}} four fly it on {{national}} holidays.

5|$|A {{central part}} of Macdonald's case {{concerned}} the redistribution of wealth from richer provinces to poorer ones. His argument {{was based on the}} premise that richer provinces benefited from national economic policies such as high tariffs while poorer provinces were penalized by them. Macdonald suggested that compensatory subsidies to poorer, less-populated provinces be based on need, not population, so that they could pay for government services available in <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> without having to impose higher-than-average levels of taxation.|$|E
5|$|The {{rebellion}}s in Essex, Kent and London {{spread to}} many other English counties. In Norfolk, the rebellion started on 14 June, {{when a group of}} rebels from Suffolk reached the county, and spread westwards towards the Fens and north-eastwards towards Norwich and Yarmouth. As in <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> there was widespread unrest, during which property and official documents were destroyed and several individuals were summarily executed.|$|E
5|$|A general {{hospital}} {{is located in}} {{the eastern side of the}} city. Modern health care facilities exist only in Bangui but are poor, providing only minimal care. Wealthier citizens make use of private clinics. The risk of catching HIV in the city is reportedly high, and many truck drivers stopping in the city for sexual services pose a major risk of spreading the disease to <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> The risk of catching malaria in Bangui and pygmy camps is also much higher than in the rest of the country.|$|E

5|$|Cockatoos are {{not wholly}} migratory, {{but they do}} exhibit regular {{seasonal}} movements {{in different parts of}} Australia. In the northern parts of the Northern Territory, they largely leave areas of high humidity in the summer wet season. In <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> cockatoo seasonal movements tend to follow food sources, a pattern recorded in Northern Queensland, and New South Wales. In southwest Western Australia, both extant subspecies appear to have a north-south pattern; northwards after breeding in the case of subspecies naso, while movements by subspecies samueli in the wheatbelt can be irregular and unrelated to the seasons.|$|E
5|$|Dhaka is {{connected}} to the <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> through highway and railway links. Five of the eight major national highways of Bangladesh start from the city. They are- N1, N2, N3, N5 and N8. Dhaka is also directly connected to two longest routes of Asian Highway Network- AH1 and AH2, as well as to AH41 route. Highway links to the Indian cities of Kolkata, Agartala, Guwahati and Shillong have been established by the Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BRTC) and private bus companies which also run regular international bus services to those cities from Dhaka.|$|E
5|$|Funding issues {{meant that}} in May 2003 the Australian Broadcasting Corporation closed ABC Kids and Fly TV. In the same year, Tasmanian Digital Television {{became the first}} digital-only {{commercial}} station to be launched in the country, under Section 38A of the Broadcasting Services Act. The new station was {{a joint venture between}} existing commercial networks Southern Cross Broadcasting and WIN Television. Tasmanian Digital Television, affiliated to Network Ten, was initially available only in Hobart, before expanding to Launceston and, by early 2009, the remainder of the state. The introduction of this fifth channel resulted in significantly higher digital television takeup in Tasmania than <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b>|$|E

5|$|However, between 28 April-2 May, the Ba'athist-dominated Military Committee {{virtually}} renounced {{the agreement}} when it purged over 50 Nasserist officers from their high-ranking {{positions in the}} armed forces, leading to a wide-scale propaganda campaign by Egypt via radio denouncing the Ba'ath (Nasserist-leaning newspapers had been previously shut down.) Mass pro-union rioting in Aleppo, Damascus, Hama and <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> followed. The purges prompted the protest resignations of Nasserist officials, including Defense Minister al-Sufi, Deputy Chief of Staff al-Qutayni, and four other Nasserist cabinet members.|$|E
5|$|The king soon revoked the {{charters}} {{of freedom}} and pardon that he had granted, and as disturbances continued in <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> he personally went into Essex to suppress the rebellion. On 28 June at Billericay, he defeated the last rebels in a small skirmish and effectively ended the Peasants' Revolt. Despite his young age, Richard had shown great courage and determination in {{his handling of the}} rebellion. It is likely, though, that the events impressed upon him the dangers of disobedience and threats to royal authority, and helped shape the absolutist attitudes to kingship that would later prove fatal to his reign.|$|E
5|$|The sports venues {{were taken}} over by the {{respective}} municipalities. The Lillehammer venues are owned by the municipal Lillehammer Olympiapark, while similar companies were created for Hamar and GjÃ¸vik. The International Broadcasting Center was built as a future campus for Lillehammer University College. The Main Press Center was converted to a business park. Only part of the athlete accommodation was built for permanent use, and was sold as regular housing after the Games. The rest was built as mobile units and sold to <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> Similarly, the media accommodation was built as a mix of permanent and temporary housing, with the latter being sold as cottages after the Games were completed.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the invasion, the pro-Saddam {{forces in}} Anbarâthe Ba'ath Party, the Republican Guard, the Fedayeen Saddam, and the Iraqi Intelligence Serviceâremained intact. Saddam hid in Ramadi and HÄ«t in early April. Other pro-Saddam forces were able to {{relocate}} from Anbar to Syria with money and weapons, where they set up headquarters. The nucleus of the insurgency in its first few months was formed from the pro-Saddam forces in Anbar and Syria. In contrast to the looting throughout Baghdad and <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> Ba'athist headquarters and homes of high-ranking Sunni leaders were relatively untouched. The head of Iraqi ground forces in the province, General Mohammed Jarawi, formally surrendered to elements of the 3rd Infantry Division at Ramadi on 15 April 2003.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, a {{researcher}} in Devon discovered {{a list of}} ingredients for a pasty tucked inside an audit book and dated 1510, calculating the cost of making a venison pasty. This replaced the previous oldest recipe, dated 1746, held by the Cornwall Records Office in Truro, Cornwall. The dish {{at the time was}} cooked with venison, in this case from the Mount Edgcumbe estate, as the pasty was then considered a luxury meal. Alongside the ledger, which included the price of the pasty in Plymouth, Devon, in 1509, the discovery sparked a controversy between the neighbouring counties of Devon and Cornwall as to the origin of the dish. However, the term pasty appears in much earlier written records from <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> as mentioned above.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Gorrostieta Salazar {{was elected}} mayor of Tiquicheo. Several drug {{trafficking}} organizations, particularly the La Familia Michoacana and the Knights Templar Cartel, {{are based in}} the area. MichoacÃ¡n is a leading producer of marijuana and opium poppy, making it a lucrative route for smugglers taking narcotics into the United States. Despite receiving threats, Gorrostieta Salazar publicly denounced the activities of these groups. The drug cartels, which are constantly fighting each other for territorial control, often target mayors who confront them. Other mayors, however, are corrupted and bribed by the cartels. Mexico has more than 2,500 municipalities, {{many of which are}} far from the capital cities and lack amenities available in <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> Many of these areas are plagued with drug-related violence, so the political parties have faced difficulties finding people interested in holding the post of mayor.|$|E
