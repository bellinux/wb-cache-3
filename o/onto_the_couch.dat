40|$|This {{research}} study aimed {{to measure the}} bending stiffness of the lumbar spine when subjected to posteroanterior mobilization. The lumbar spine was modeled as an initially curved beam column supported over the rib cage and the pelvis. Together with the posteroanterior mobilization force acted on the spine formed the three-point bending of the beam. The bending stiffness of the spine {{was derived from the}} mobilization force and the change in curvature of the spine. The mobilization force was measured by mounting a force plate <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> mobilization <b>couch,</b> and electromagnetic sensors were used to measure the change in spinal curvature. The mean bending stiffness of the spine was found to be 38. 5 Nm 2. The theoretical modelling suggested that the pelvic rotation produced by mobilization may be employed to provide an indicator of the magnitude of the mobilization force.

40|$|This study {{measured}} the bending stiffness {{of the spine}} when it is subjected to posteroanterior mobilization force. The lumbar spine was modeled as an initially curved beam column supported over the rib cage and the pelvis. Posteroanterior mobilization {{was assumed to be}} three-point bending of the beam. The mobilization force was measured by the mounting of a force plate <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> manipulation <b>couch,</b> where electromagnetic sensors {{measured the}} change in spinal curvature. The bending stiffness of the spine was derived from the force and curvature data. The technique developed in this study provided highly repeatable data. The theoretical analysis suggests that the pelvic rotation produced by mobilization may be used clinically to indicate the magnitude of the mobilization force. Future research may employ the present method to determine how back pain may affect the bending stiffness of the spine. The bending stiffness values reported in this study will be valuable to future modeling work. Department of Rehabilitation SciencesAuthor name used in this publication: Raymond Y. W.

5000|$|One day, George Liquor is {{standing}} {{outside of a}} pet store, watching Ren and Stimpy sleep in the window and gets the idea to adopt them as his pets. Upon arriving home, he introduces them to their new abode: a fish bowl from which the fish was rudely thrown out (and stole George's car as a result). The next day Ren and Stimpy awaken to find George Liquor dressed as a drill sergeant to train them to be proper pets. Their first lesson is house training by doing butt-push-ups on a newspaper. Ren fails, but Stimpy easily does his business while reading about mudslides. He is given a cigar-shaped dog treat as a reward. Next they are taught discipline. To learn discipline, first they {{have to learn to}} disobey. George Liquor tells them not to go anywhere near the couch, then instructs them to do just that so they can be punished. When he begins to become enraged by them not following his orders, Ren freaks out and collapses to the floor sobbing, and a terrified Stimpy hurls himself <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> as George had instructed, only to be yelled at. Stimpy is scared, thinking he's going to be punished. Instead, George compliments him for following orders and gives him another dog treat. Then George asks Ren to ask him for punishment. But George insists that Ren is too [...] "soft" [...] for punishment and instead gives him 20 dollars and tells him to take the car and see a movie as well. Ren points out that the fish already took the car and it looks like George is going to be enraged. Instead, he gives Ren another 20 dollars for being a smart mouth.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the final}} season of The Carol Burnett Show, cast member Tim Conway ad-libbed {{a story about}} {{elephants}} during both tapings of the show and cracked up his cast mates both times. In the first one he talks about seeing an elephant with a dwarf trainer and mentioning {{that there was a}} rumor going around the circus that the elephant and the trainer were lovers, pushing Burnett, Lawrence, and Van Dyke to a breaking point and hiding their faces from the audience. At one point the camera focuses on Burnett and Lawrence staring at him in exasperation. Finally, Burnett started swatting at Conway with the game card to get him to stop. In the second one he talks about seeing a pair of Siamese elephants during a trip to a freak show, describing in detail how they were connected at the trunk and the sounds they made. The audience was in hysterics the entire time while Burnett, Lawrence and Dick Van Dyke desperately struggled to maintain composure, and even Conway is seen trying to stifle his laughter numerous times. At one point Lawrence looked at Burnett, started to look away, then did a quick look back at her and had to turn away, breaking character and laughing. Several times when Conway would stop, the rest of the cast would collect themselves, at which point Conway would continue with his ad libbing, pushing them again to the edge of breaking up. When Burnett managed to gain her composure one last time, she turned to Lawrence to help get the script moving again, to which Lawrence quipped (in character), [...] "You sure that little asshole's through?" [...] At that point chaos ensued with the entire cast breaking up and the audience was screaming with delight. Conway and Van Dyke both fell off the ends of the couch to the floor laughing, with Conway rolling around and Van Dyke lying flat on his back and eventually sitting up. Burnett fell back <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> and can be seen muttering to herself while shaking with laughter. Lawrence herself managed to keep it together for only a few seconds after everyone fell apart before cracking up herself. In an interview, Lawrence talks about the famous sketch, recalling that it was her husband's suggestion to [...] "get" [...] Conway when she found out between tapings that the elephant story part of the sketch was being changed but was not given any details. The director's only advice on it was [...] "good luck". She also noted {{that it was one of}} the rare occasions when she really cut loose on the show.|$|E
40|$|A {{system for}} visual {{guidance}} in patient set-up for external-beam radiotherapy procedures was developed using augmented reality. The system uses video cameras to obtain {{views of the}} linear accelerator, and the live images are displayed on a monitor in the treatment room. A 3 D model of the patient’s external surface, obtained from planning CT data, is superimposed <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> treatment <b>couch</b> in <b>the</b> camera images. The augmented monitor can then be viewed, and alignment performed against the virtual contour. The system provides an intuitive method for set-up guidance, and allows non-rigid de-formations to patient pose to be visualised. It also allows changes to patient geometry between treatment fractions to become observable, and can remain in operation throughout the treatment procedure, so that patient motion becomes apparent. Coordinate registration between the camera view and the linac is performed using a cube which is aligned with the linac isocentre using room lasers or cone-beam CT. The AR tracking software detects planar fiducial tracking markers attached to the cube faces, and determines their positions in order to perform pose estimation of the 3 D model on-screen...|$|R

40|$|As Doctor Who {{approaches}} its fiftieth anniversary recent series {{have taken}} the show to new heights in terms of popular appeal and critical acclaim. The Doctor and his TARDIS-driven adventures, along with companions and iconic monsters, are now recognised and enjoyed globally. The time is ripe for a detailed analytic assessment of this cultural phenomenon. Focussing on the most recent television output The Inner World of Doctor Who examines why the show continues to fascinate contemporary audiences. Presenting closely-observed psychoanalytic readings of selected episodes, this book examines why these stories of time travel, monsters, and complex human relationships {{have been successful in}} providing such an emotionally rich dramatization of human experience. The Inner World of Doctor Who seeks to explore the multiple cultural and emotional dimensions of the series, moving back and forth from behind the famous sofa, where children remember hiding from scary monsters, and <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> proverbial psychoanalytic <b>couch.</b> <b>The</b> approach that the authors take recognizes the richness that Doctor Who contains, episode by episode and in its culture and mythos, in order to show how Doctor Who adventures can be appreciated in the acknowledgement that both sofa and couch provide lively places from which to enjoy the stories as they continue to unfold for the next fifty years...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 36 - 37) This study {{measured the}} photon beam attenuation {{characteristics of the}} Varian EXACT, Varian IGRT treatment couches and two CIVCO Universal extensions used during external beam radiotherapy; and assessed the accuracy of Varian's Eclipse treatment planning system in modeling the beam attenuation of each couch. Dose Measurements were taken using a Farmer ion chamber inside a cylindrical acrylic phantom. They were taken for two photon energies (6 MV and 15 MV), at three different field sizes, for various gantry angles through <b>the</b> <b>couch.</b> <b>The</b> EXACT <b>couch</b> was tested both with the adjustable rails pushed {{to the outside of}} <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> and pushed to the center of <b>the</b> <b>couch.</b> <b>The</b> IGRT <b>couch</b> was divided by thickness into three sections for more accurate representation of attenuation along the length of <b>the</b> <b>couch.</b> Effects on surface dose are measured using a Tissue Maximum Ratio for <b>the</b> Varian EXACT <b>couch,</b> and Percent Depth Dose curves for the Varian IGRT and CIVCO extensions. Both CIVCO extensions were introduced into the Eclipse planning system by tracing <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> structures as in viewed in Ct images. All measurements were modeled in the Eclipse treatment planning system for comparison. Maximum attenuation was measured at 6 MV with the smallest field for all <b>couch</b> setups. <b>The</b> EXACT <b>couch</b> produced a maximum attenuation of 19. 2 % and a surface dose increase of 47 % of D[subscript lower case max] through <b>the</b> <b>couch.</b> Maximum attenuation for <b>the</b> IGRT <b>couch</b> and both CIVCO extensions were between 6 - 8 %. Through <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> <b>the</b> IGRT <b>couch</b> showed a surface dose increase of 29 % of D[subscript lower case max],; the CIVCO extensions produced a surface dose increase of 33 % and 7 % of D[subscript lower case max]. Maximum difference between measured and planned dose was 7 %, for <b>the</b> EXACT <b>couch,</b> 1. 9 % for <b>the</b> IGRT <b>couch</b> and 2. 4 % for both CIVCO extensions. These treatment couches were shown to affect delivered and surface dose. Including <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> structure during treatment planning can account for <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> attenuation in most cases, but some attenuation values are underestimated in the planning software. Largest effects are for oblique treatment angles using low energy and small field size...|$|R
