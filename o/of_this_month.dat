25|$|We first {{find the}} Muslim month number {{corresponding}} to {{the first month of}} the Jewish year which begins in AD20874. Dividing 20874 by 19 gives quotient 1098 and remainder 12. Dividing 2026 by 19 gives quotient 106 and remainder 12. 2026 is chosen because it gives the same remainder on division by 19 as 20874. The two years are therefore (1098–106)=992×19 years apart. The Muslim month number {{corresponding to the}} first Jewish month is therefore 992×7=6944 higher than in 2026. To convert into years and months divide by twelve – 6944/12=578 years and 8 months. Adding, we get 1447y 10m + 20874y – 2026y + 578y 8m = 20874y 6m. Therefore, the first month of the Jewish year beginning in AD20874 corresponds to the sixth month of the Muslim year AH20874. The worked example in Conversion between Jewish and civil dates, shows that the civil date of the first day <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>month</b> (ignoring the displacements) is Friday, 14 June. The year AH20875 will therefore begin seven months later, {{on the first day of}} the eighth Jewish month, which the worked example shows to be 7 January, AD20875 (again ignoring the displacements). The date given by this method, being calculated, may differ by a day from the actual date, which is determined by observation.|$|E

500|$|In 1954, Charles Patterson {{defended the}} poem and claimed, [...] "The meaningfulness {{and range of}} the poem, along with its {{controlled}} execution and powerfully suggestive imagery, entitle it to a high place among Keats's great odes. It lacks the even finish and extreme perfection of To Autumn but is much superior in these qualities to the Ode to a Nightingale despite the magic passages in the latter and the similarities of over-all structure. In fact, the Ode on a Grecian Urn may deserve to rank first in the group if viewed in something approaching its true complexity and human wisdom." [...] Walter Jackson Bate argued in 1962 that [...] "the Grecian Urn possesses a quiet and constrained composure hardly equaled by the other odes <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>month</b> and perhaps even unsurpassed by the ode To Autumn of the following September... there is a severe repose about the Ode on a Grecian Urn; it is both 'interwoven' and 'complete'; and within its tensely braced stanzas is a potential energy momentarily stilled and imprisoned." [...] In 1964, literary critic David Perkins claimed in his essay [...] "The Ode on a Nightingale" [...] that {{the symbol of the}} urn [...] "may possibly not satisfy as the principal concern of poetry... but is rather an element in the poetry and drama of human reactions".|$|E

Directly behind King George V, Washington passed through the same stretch of sea as the sinking destroyer, receiving damage from depth charges as they went down with the ship and exploded as they sank. Though damage to the hull was minimal—limited to only one leaking fuel tank—many devices on the ship were damaged, including all of the main battery range finders and three circuit breakers.
