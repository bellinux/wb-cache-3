5|$|Barrett {{became a}} free agent {{after the end of the}} season, but was offered {{arbitration}} from the Padres. The Tampa Bay Rays expressed interest in signing Barrett, even though the signing would involve trading the Padres a future second round draft pick as compensation. Barrett accepted the Padres' arbitration offer on December 7. The Padres placed Barrett on the disabled list on April 8, 2008, after he sustained an elbow injury. The team later activated him on May 25, after he had recovered, and completed a minor league rehabilitation assignment. On July 2, 2008, Barrett was rushed to the hospital after fouling a pitch <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> He required surgery to repair the damage, and had been placed on the disabled list for the second time in 2008. The Padres waived Barrett on October 11, after he previously expressed interest in testing the free-agent market.|$|E
25|$|On {{the mythical}} island of Okoto, the Mask Maker {{brothers}} - Ekimu and Makuta - forged masks of elemental {{power for the}} island's villagers. However, jealous of his brother's higher-rated craftsmanship, Makuta broke an ancient vow by forging a mask {{with more than one}} element; the Mask of Ultimate Power. Putting it on, the mask took control over him and began to destroy the island, forcing Ekimu to confront him. Knocking the mask off Makuta's face, a shock wave from the battle rolled across Okoto and sent both brothers into an endless sleep, while their masks - the Mask of Creation and the Mask of Control, as well as the Mask of Ultimate Power - were scattered across the island. After the leaders of the villages, the Protectors, buried Ekimu, Okoto was overran with Skull Spiders searching for the powerful masks. On the brink of giving up hope, the Protectors send a prayer they heard from whispers from Ekimu's lifeless body to the skies during a celestial alignment, resulting in six powerful heroes, the Toa, to crash-land on the island. Each masters of a sacred element, the Toa - Tahu, Kopaka, Pohatu, Gali, Onua and Lewa - are quickly enlisted by the Protectors in their battle against the Skull Spiders as well as embarking on a quest to find their golden Masks of Power that are the key to unlocking their full elemental abilities. Once claimed, the Toa meet for the first time outside the ancient city of the Mask Makers. Defeating the Lord of Skull Spiders upon arrival, they venture inside in search of the resting place of Ekimu. Battling an army of skeleton warriors under the control of Makuta's surviving spirit, the Toa overcome their ranks before finding Ekimu's tomb and awakening him. However, the leader of the skeleton warriors, the Skull Grinder, has obtained Ekimu's Mask of Creation. Donning it, he defeats the Toa with ease and damages their masks, but their efforts give Ekimu the time to recreate his Hammer of Power and defeat the Skull Grinder by knocking the mask <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> Donning his sacred mask once again, Ekimu recreates the Toa's golden masks, while they all agree that Makuta is still out there; readying for his next attack.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} stages of the war between AAA and La Sociedad, Cibernético was one of the top técnicos {{fighting}} for AAA. On October 1, 2010, at Héroes Inmortales IV, he was scheduled to team up Heavy Metal, La Parka and Octagón against a team of La Sociedad representatives, but prior to the match Konnan announced that Cibernético had decided to turn his back on AAA and join his team instead. AAA bought Konnan's claim and replaced Cibernético and Octagón, who was injured in a backstage assault by someone resembling Cibernético, in the match with Dark Ozz and Dark Cuervo. However, in the end Cibernético interfered in the match and helped AAA pick up the win. Afterwards, Cibernético, upset with AAA and in particular his friend La Parka for believing he had turned on the company, decided to re–form his old group Los Bizarros with Amadeus, Escoria, Nygma and Taboo. Cibernético made clear that even though Los Bizarros were no longer with AAA, they were not part of La Sociedad either, solidifying the group's status as tweeners. He also tried to recruit his friend El Mesías to join the group, but he decided to stay out of the war of words between his two friends. On November 22, the feud between Cibernético and La Parka turned physical, when Los Bizarros ran out to save El Mesías from a beatdown at the hands of La Sociedad, without making the save for La Parka and Jack Evans. When Parka confronted Cibernético, he was laid out with a stunner, after which Los Bizarros beat him down and Cibernético ripped his mask <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> The first major battle between Cibernético and La Parka took place on December 5, 2010, at Guerra de Titanes, where Parka teamed up with Dark Espíritu, Extreme Tiger and Jack Evans to defeat Cibernético, Escoria, Nygma and Taboo. After the match, Los Bizarros once again beat down La Parka, after which Cibernético admitted that while Super Fly had been outed as the man who had attacked Octagón prior to Héroes Inmortales IV, he was in fact the one who had orchestrated the attack, meaning that Parka had been right about him all along. He then introduced the returning Charly Manson, who had most recently worked for rival promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), as the newest member of Los Bizarros. The group's lineup would be finalized a couple of months later with the addition of Billy el Malo, who jumped to Los Bizarros from La Sociedad. Cibernético and La Parka continued their heated rivalry the following months during which it was implied that Cibernético had assaulted and hospitalized Parka's three-year-old son, his own godson, with a broken leg and even provided X-rays, which he used to taunt Parka with. At March's Rey de Reyes, Los Bizarros, represented by Cibernético, Billy el Malo, Escoria and Nygma defeated La Parka, Jack Evans, Joe Líder and Nicho el Millonario, after which Cibernético threatened to light Parka on fire, before being driven out of the ring by Nicho. In May, La Parka formed his own group El Inframundo ("The Underworld") with Dark Ozz, Dark Cuervo, Dark Espíritu and the recently debuted Drago to counteract Los Bizarros. On May 13, La Parka challenged Cibernético to a battle of the groups at Triplemanía XIX, which he accepted. It was later revealed that for the event Parka's team would be joined by Octagón, looking for revenge for what happened to him nine months earlier. During the event, Octagón would also become the fifth inductee into the AAA Hall of Fame, following in the footsteps of Antonio Peña, Rey Mysterio Jr., Eddie Guerrero and Pepe Casas.|$|E

An unpleasant neighbor, who also has a lump, hears of the old man's good fortune and attempts to repeat it, and steal the gift. The tengu, however, simply give him the first lump in addition to his own, because they are disgusted by his bad dancing, and because he tried to steal the gift.|$|E
500|$|The film {{appeared}} in It Came from Hollywood, a 1982 comedy film featuring {{a compilation of}} clips from more than 100 B movies from the 1930s to the 1970s, which are shown between scripted segments performed by comedians. Baker's effects from The Incredible Melting Man inspired the makeup effects for a scene in the science fiction-action film RoboCop (1987). During the scene, Emil Antonowsky (Paul McCrane) attempts to drive RoboCop off the road, but instead accidentally drives into a vat of toxic waste, causing the flesh to melt <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> and hands. These effects were conceived and designed by special makeup effects artist Rob Bottin, who was inspired by Baker's work on The Incredible Melting Man and dubbed the RoboCop effects [...] "the Melting Man" [...] as an homage to the production.|$|E

500|$|A {{negative}} {{review in}} The Guardian claimed {{that what was}} wrong with the film was carried over from the book: [...] "The result is an inflated, good-looking bore of a movie. The Silence of the Lambs was a marvelous thing. This, by contrast is barely okey-dokey." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film a [...] "Thumbs down" [...] rating on the television program At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper and gave the film a 2.5 out of 4 stars rating in his print review, which he began with the following: [...] "Ridley Scott's Hannibal is a carnival geek show. We must give it credit for the courage of its depravity; if it proves nothing else, it proves that if a man cutting <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> and feeding it to his dogs doesn't get the NC-17 rating for violence, nothing ever will." [...] Hannibal has an overall Metacritic rating of 57 out of 100 from 36 reviews and a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 39%, with an average rating of 5.1 out of 10 from 163 reviews.|$|E

Joe knew immediately the thumb of his left hand was damaged, though he wasn't sure as to the extent. [...] "In the midst of the fight, with your adrenaline pumping, it's hard to gauge such things. My mind was on more important matters. Like how I was going to deal with Yemelyanov {{for the rest of the}} fight." [...] The match ended when the Soviet's handlers threw in the towel at 1:49 {{in the second round}}, and the referee raised Joe's injured hand in victory.|$|E
2500|$|Gooch was enraged, {{as he was}} by Gower's mode of {{dismissal}} at {{a crucial}} stage {{of one of the}} Test matches. During the fourth Test at Adelaide, Gower walked out to the crease to the tune of Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines. The last ball before lunch was bowled down the leg side to a leg trap, and all Gower needed to do was block. However, Gower flicked idly at the delivery and was caught at leg-slip. According to Mike Atherton in his autobiography, [...] "Gooch was at the other end and as he walked <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> was thunderous". This was another example of the strained relationship between the two. His score of nought in the second innings at Melbourne in 1991, when England were chasing quick runs for victory, ended his world record, unbroken sequence, of 119 Test innings without registering a duck. Gower scored 73 and 31* in the following matches against Pakistan; however on 9 August 1992 he was dismissed for one by Waqar Younis in what would be his last Test match, at The Oval. It is often thought that Gooch was instrumental in Gower being left out of the following tour of India. The selection decision prompted a vote of no confidence in the selectors at the MCC, but it was to no avail as Gower was not included. In response to Gooch's perceived regime of hard work over talent, Gower retired from international cricket in early 1993.|$|E

2500|$|In 1963 [...] Frank Worrell led an {{exciting}} West Indies team on their tour of England. They won the First Test at Old Trafford by an innings, with Cowdrey being bowled round his legs by Hall for 4 after swaying {{away from a}} delivery which kept lower than he expected. The Second Test at Lord's {{was one of the}} best he played in. Fred Trueman took 6/100 and Cowdrey three catches to dismiss the tourists for 301 and the captain Ted Dexter thrashed Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith round the ground for 70 off 75 balls in England's reply of [...] 297. Dexter couldn't field due to an injury taken when batting so Cowdrey led the team and took 3 more catches as Trueman took 5/52 and the West Indies' 229 relied almost entirely on Basil Butcher's 133. Needing 234 to win England were reduced to 31/3, but had recovered to 72/3 when Cowdrey fended a bouncer from Hall <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> and broke his wrist, retiring hurt on 19. Ken Barrington (60) and Brian Close (70) took England to the verge of victory and when Derek Shackleton was run out in the last over they were 228/9, needing five runs to tie, six runs to win, one wicket to lose or to survive two balls for a draw. Cowdrey returned to the crease with his arm in plaster and stood at the non-striker's end while Dave Allen blocked the last two balls for a draw. England won the Third Test, but lost the series 3–1 and Cowdrey was unable to play for the rest of the season.|$|E
