5|$|Leon {{debuted in}} Resident Evil 2 (1998), {{as one of}} the game's two protagonists {{alongside}} Claire Redfield. In the story, he is a police officer on his first day who arrives in the Midwestern United States town of Raccoon City just after a viral outbreak started. He meets Claire by chance as she is chased by zombies created by the T-virus. Together, they flee towards the Raccoon City Police Department building but soon get separated and go on their <b>own</b> <b>ways.</b> They eventually meet again at the Umbrella Corporation underground research complex responsible for the viral outbreak. Along the way, Leon teams-up with Ada Wong, a mysterious woman eventually revealed as a spy seeking a sample of the even more powerful G-virus. During the final confrontation against the seemingly unstoppable T-103 Tyrant that constantly pursues the characters, Ada tosses Leon (or Claire, depending on the scenario) a rocket launcher to destroy the creature. In the end, Leon faces and kills the grotesquely mutated Umbrella scientist William Birkin, and escapes from the self-destructing facility along with Claire and Birkin's young daughter Sherry.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise {{arrives at}} Ornara, and Sobi and Langor {{have agreed to}} provide the Felicium to the Ornarans for later payment. However, Picard announces that as the Prime Directive {{prevents}} him from interfering in the transactions between the two planets, it also prevents him from providing any replacement parts for the aging freighters. T'Jon and Romas are furious at the decision as {{it means that the}} trade between Ornara and Brekka will stop because the freighters can no longer make the trips without the parts. After the four are transported off the Enterprise, Picard confides to Dr. Crusher that while the Ornarans may suffer from withdrawal symptoms in the short term, this will be an opportunity for both races to advance in their <b>own</b> <b>ways.</b>|$|E

25|$|Tensions {{emanated from}} the extramarital activity, and in 1952, Wolfe and Burke went their <b>own</b> <b>ways.</b> Wolfe retaliated as he froze Burke out of wrestling among all NWA channels. Burke {{consulted}} Jack Pfefer for help. The Alliance attempted to reconcile the couple and the final result was that one would sell out to the other. Burke actually volunteered to sell for $50,000 but was rebuffed. On January 26, 1953, Wolfe sold to Burke, who created the company Attractions, Inc. The deal was for $30,000, all alimony was waived and Wolfe was barred from participating for five years. The pledge lasted {{only a few months}} as Wolfe started promoting wrestling in Columbus, Ohio. Wolfe tempted many grapplers by offering 50 percent of the proceeds. Burke challenged him by offering 60 percent of the proceeds from her promotion but Wolfe settled on the figure of 75 percent.|$|E
25|$|He {{comes from}} a wealthy family of Olivers, and his father owned a large {{business}} venture that went bankrupt {{by the time of}} his death: he and his two brothers went to a life of crime and were very successful while maintaining a noble appearance in the public: however, after they went their <b>own</b> <b>ways,</b> both of his brothers died. He managed to keep his criminal enterprise secret while being tailed by the police until he was discovered. He was sentenced to life in prison, but he managed to switch seats with an American criminal due to be transferred, and then he freed himself during a flight by parachuting himself out. He landed in New York and he was discovered by Number One while he was trying to hustle a rich businessman, and was persuaded to join TNT. His lateral thinking, wittiness and ability to save himself quickly from the most complicated situations make him the most valuable agent of TNT, a trait that even Number One acknowledges.|$|E
