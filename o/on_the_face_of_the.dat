5|$|The courts {{recognise}} {{two forms}} of secret trust. Fully secret trusts are trusts not referred to at all <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> will. Instead, an agreement made between the testator and trustees elsewhere. The trustee will instead be named only a beneficiary. In {{the case of a}} half-secret trust, the fact that the beneficiary holds as trustee only is declared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> will, but not the other terms of the trust.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from baseball, Meusel {{worked as a}} security guard at a US Navy base for 15 years. He was in attendance when his former teammate Lou Gehrig made his famous 'Luckiest Man <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth' speech on July 4, 1939. He also appeared in the 1942 film The Pride of the Yankees, as well as the 1948 film The Babe Ruth Story, as himself in a cameo role on both occasions.|$|E
5|$|Ritter von Laurin, the Austrian {{consul-general}} in Egypt, {{was able}} to inspect a fragment of the Stone removed by Muhammad Ali in 1817 and reported {{that it had a}} pitch-black exterior and a silver-grey, fine-grained interior in which tiny cubes of a bottle-green material were embedded. There are reportedly a few white or yellow spots <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stone, and it is officially described as being white {{with the exception of the}} face.|$|E

5|$|Mycena arcangeliana {{mushrooms}} leave a whitish spore print, {{while the}} spores are shaped like apple seeds and amyloid, {{meaning that they}} stain a dark colour in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution. The basidia are four-spored. They measure from between 7 and 8 micrometres(µm) by 4.5 and 5µm. There are {{a large number of}} hyaline cheilocystidia (cystidia {{on the edge of the}} gills) which are club-shaped or ovate. They have thin cell walls, and are covered in grain-like warts. The pleurocystidia (the cystidia <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gill) are similar in appearance. The pileipellis is made up of wart-covered hyphae measuring between 2 and 4.5µm wide and up to 30µm long. The outermost layer of the stem is made up hyphae with short, cylindrical hairs. The hyphae have clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|The {{edge of the}} gill is sterile, {{made up of a}} mass of cystidia (cheilocystidia). The {{club-shaped}} cheilocystidia measure from 10 to 25 by 7 to 12μm, {{and sport}} multiple cylindrical appendages on their tips, measuring 1 to 7 by 1 to 1.5μm. The cheilocystidia are colourless, with cell walls of variable thickness, and are inamyloid. There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gills). The caulocystidia (cystidia in the stem) measure 60 to 200 by 4 to 7µm. They are cylindrical and erect, forming the visible bristles. The tip is either pointed or rounded, and the cell walls are smooth and colourless, up to 2µm thick. They are dextrinoid, meaning they stain a reddish-brown when they come into contact with iodine from Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is {{typically}} a creamy white, {{with a slight}} salmon tinge, {{but it has been}} observed to vary from white to yellow depending on the density, meaning {{that it is not a}} useful means of identification. Individual spores are a buff-white, amyloid (staining blue in Melzer's reagent) and hyaline. In shape, the spores are elliptic, with a moderately well-developed network of ridges, measuring between 8 and 9.5 by 6.5 to 7.5 micrometres(μm). The pleurocystidia (cystidia <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gills) are shaped like narrow spindles, typically measuring between 40 and 75μm long, but sometimes reaching 86μm in length, by 6 and 11μm wide at the widest point. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the edge of the gills) are leaf or spindle shaped, measuring between 30 and 52μm long by 4 to 7μm wide. The basidia are four-spored and club-shaped, measuring between 36 and 42μm in length by 8 and 12μm wide.|$|E

5|$|Typically, cemeteries of {{more than}} 40 graves contain a Cross of Sacrifice {{designed}} by architect Reginald Blomfield. This cross was designed to imitate medieval crosses found in churchyards in England with proportions more commonly seen in the Celtic cross. The cross is normally a freestanding four-point limestone Latin cross, mounted on an octagonal base, and ranging in height from 14 to 32 feet. A bronze longsword, blade down, is embedded <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cross. This cross represents {{the faith of the}} majority of the dead and the sword represents the military character of the cemetery, intended to link British soldiers and the Christian concept of self-sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Itzam K'an Ahk II {{constructed}} {{at least}} five known stelae: 9, 10, 11, 22, and 40. Stelae 9, 10, and 11 were all erected in front of or near Structure J-3. Stela 11, which was erected in August of 731 AD, is of the niche variety, meaning it depicts the ruler seated in a small hollow, or niche, and it was erected to commemorate the accession {{of the individual to}} the position of ajaw. The monument shows the ajaw flanked by subjects, witnesses to the ceremonies explored <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stela. The expanse in front of the stone slab is designated as a space for offerings, denoted by the depiction of a sacrificed human {{near the bottom of the}} monument. The monument was discovered by Teoberto Maler in two pieces on the ground; the front was in good condition, and some pigment was still visible. The glyphs on the upper right have been weathered, but the sides are largely intact. In the 1960s, looters cut the fallen monument into two halves for easier removal. The top portion is currently housed in the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, Texas, whereas the bottom half is in a private collection in Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|Marasmius sasicola {{produces}} colourless, ellipsoid basidiospores {{of between}} 8 and 10 by 4 to 6micrometres (μm). The spores have no ornamentation, are not amyloid and have thin cell walls. In his examinations, Takahashi did not observe any basidia, {{but he did}} describe the club-shaped basidioles (immature basidia) which measured from 18 to 26 by 6 to 10μm. The tightly packed cheilocystidia (cystidia {{on the edge of}} the gill) form a sterile edge to the gill, and there are no pleurocystidia (cystidia <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gill). The pileipellis, the top layer of the cap, forms a hymeniderm, a cell structure reminiscent of the hymenium on the gills. This is made up of club-shaped cells measuring between 2 and 8 by 7 to 10μm, with reddish-brown, smooth cell walls up to 1μm thick. The stipitipellis, the outermost layer of the stem, is made up of cylindrical hyphae measuring from 3 to 6μm in width, which run parallel to one another. They have featureless brown cell walls measuring up to 1μm thick, and the septa (the walls separating individual cells) have clamp connections.|$|E

25|$|The {{monument}} {{is unique}} for Kentucky Civil War monuments {{in that it}} is built of zinc, whereas most are made of marble or limestone.

25|$|Kickers and slingshots are {{rubber pads}} which propel {{the ball away}} upon impact, like bumpers, but are usually a {{horizontal}} side of a wall. Every recent pinball machine includes slingshots to the upper left and upper right of the lowest set of flippers; older games used more experimental arrangements. They operate similarly to pop bumpers, with a switch {{on each side of}} a solenoid-operated lever arm in a typical arrangement. The switches are closed by ball contact with the rubber <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kicker and this activates the solenoid.|$|E
