5|$|In the Adler {{variation}} 3...Ng4 4.Nf3, after White {{has moved}} f2–f4, the e3-pawn becomes a backward pawn on an <b>open</b> <b>file.</b> Black can then apply {{pressure on the}} e-file in general, against the e3-pawn and the e4-square in particular. Typical moves in this plan would include the manoeuvre Ne5–d7–f6, followed by putting the heavy pieces on the e-file with Rf8–e8 and Qd8–e7 (see diagram at right). The Bc5 is already well placed to pressure the e3-pawn. Depending on circumstances, the Bc8 may be involved either on b7 or on f5, in both cases to assert control over the central e4-square.|$|E

Defense attorney Joseph Cheshire responded to the news by saying that if the book was truthful, [...] "I think it would be fabulous, and I don't think anybody would think badly about her in any way, shape or form", but that if the memoir did not acknowledge the falsity of her allegations against the players, that he would advise them to initiate civil action against her. Her book was published later that year. In it, she continued to contend that she had been raped at the party and that the dropping of the case was politically motivated. The book outlined her earlier life, including a claim that she was first raped at the age of 14.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the day of}} Hoover's death, Hoover's {{secretary}} for five decades, Helen Gandy, began destroying his files. She turned over twelve boxes of the [...] "Official/Confidential" [...] files to Felt on May 4, 1972. This consisted of 167 files and 17,750 pages, many of them containing derogatory information. Felt stored them in his office, and Gray told the press that afternoon that [...] "there are no dossiers or secret files. There are just general files and I took steps to preserve their integrity." [...] Felt earlier that day had told Gray, [...] "Mr. Gray, the Bureau doesn't have any secret files", and later accompanied Gray to Hoover's office. They found Gandy boxing up papers. Felt said Gray [...] "looked casually at an <b>open</b> <b>file</b> drawer and approved her work", though Gray would later deny he looked at anything. Gandy retained Hoover's [...] "Personal File" [...] and destroyed it. When Felt was called to testify in 1975 by the U.S. House about the destruction of Hoover's papers, he said, [...] "There's no serious problems if we lose some papers. I don't see anything wrong and I still don't." [...] At the same hearing, Gandy claimed that she had destroyed Hoover's personal files only after receiving Gray's approval. In a letter submitted to the committee in rebuttal of Gandy's testimony, Gray vehemently denied ever giving such permission. Both Gandy's testimony and Gray's letter {{were included in the}} committee's final report.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1950s, Bob Baker, a local bush {{pilot and}} prospector, noticed red-stained creeks in the area, {{but was unable}} to land his plane nearby. In 1968, at Bakers urging, a U.S. Geological Survey {{geologist}} sampled rocks and stream sediments in the region, including samples from the future site of the Red Dog mine, and named Red Dog Creek after Bob Baker's dog, an Irish Terrier (Tailleur; USGS <b>Open</b> <b>File</b> 70-319). [...] In the mid 1970s, after investigations by BLM-contracted geologists confirmed significant mineralization, interest in the region from major mining companies and NANA intensified. Significant exploration, soon including drilling, of deposits in the region began in 1975 (Alaska Minerals Yearbook 1978-1979). In 1980 the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) became law and NANA officially selected the land underlying Red Dog. Drill exploration of the Red Dog deposit began in 1980, by Cominco American. In 1982 NANA and Cominco American (a mining company that had staked the land, and later became Teck Cominco) signed an agreement to develop the deposit. In 1986 the State of Alaska agreed to fund and take ownership of a road (DeLong Mts. Transportation System) from Red Dog to the coast, and a shallow-water port site. Also in 1986, residents of Kotzebue and 10 other area villages voted to form the Northwest Arctic Borough, to be economically based on taxing the Red Dog mine. Construction of the road, port site, and mine began in July 1987. Mine operations commenced in December 1989.|$|E

He has also invented a certain <b>open</b> <b>file,</b> which is of great use in finishing {{the surface of the}} marble; and likewise a machine for making these files and for punching holes through iron, and he demonstrated its efficiency by punching a hole through an iron bar, with a force equivalent to ten thousand pounds, by the mere application of a part of his own weight. These inventions, he says, are his amusement, and the bent of his nature towards sculpture must indeed have been strong, to counteract, in an American, such a capacity for the contrivance of steam-engines.
