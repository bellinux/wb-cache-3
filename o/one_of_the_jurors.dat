5|$|Kinne's {{second trial}} {{for the murder of}} James Kinne began on March 23, 1964. As jury {{selection}} got underway that day, the public was initially barred from the proceedings, but the restriction was soon loosened and the media were allowed into the courtroom. An unusually long jury selection process made {{the first day of the}} trial last fourteen hours, beginning at 9 a.m. and not ending until nearly midnight the same day; presiding judge Paul Carver noted that due to the notoriety of the case, he had been forced to choose between sequestering the entire jury pool overnight and forcing the court into a long day. The eventual jury, all men, were immediately sequestered, but days later, a mistrial was declared after it emerged that a law partner of prosecutor Lawrence Gepford had once been retained by <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurors.</b>|$|E

In Suspect, {{she played a}} public defender who is both helped and romanced by <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurors</b> in the {{homicide}} case she is handling. Along with Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer, she starred as one of three divorcees involved with a mysterious and wealthy visitor from hell who comes to a small New England town in the comedy horror The Witches of Eastwick. In Norman Jewison's romantic comedy Moonstruck, she played an Italian widow {{in love with her}} fiancé's younger brother. The two latter films ranked among the top ten highest-grossing films of 1987, at number ten and five, respectively. For her performance in Moonstruck, Cher won the Academy Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. By 1988, Cher had {{become one of the most}} bankable actresses of the decade, commanding $1million per film. That year, she released the fragrance Uninhibited, which earned about $15million in its first year sales.|$|E

25|$|Harriman's campaign, however, {{was tied}} to the {{asserted}} innocence of the McNamaras. But the defense was in trouble: the prosecution not only had evidence of the McNamaras' complicity, but had trapped Darrow in a clumsy attempt to bribe <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurors.</b> On December 1, 1911, {{four days before the}} final election, the McNamaras entered a plea of guilty in return for prison terms.

25|$|Three months later, bombs {{exploded}} in the New York subway, in a Philadelphia church, and {{at the home of}} the mayor of Baltimore.

On May 18, 1928, a bomb destroyed the front porch of the home of executioner Robert Elliott. As late as 1932, Judge Thayer's home was wrecked and his wife and housekeeper were injured in a bomb blast. Afterward, Thayer lived permanently at his club in Boston, guarded 24 hours a day until his death on April 18, 1933.|$|E
25|$|The union hired Clarence Darrow {{to defend}} the McNamaras. Darrow, however, {{concluded}} that the brothers faced a strong chance of receiving {{the death penalty for}} the crime; he therefore made a clumsy attempt, in broad daylight in downtown Los Angeles, to bribe <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurors.</b> As it turned out, it was a trap and Darrow was arrested. Now more desperate than ever, he persuaded the McNamaras to plead guilty on the basis of an unwritten plea bargain that would have freed John. Once they pleaded guilty, however, the authorities denied that they had any deal at all. John McNamara served nearly ten years, while his brother spent his remaining years in prison.|$|E
25|$|Maurice Griffith was rector {{here from}} 1537 {{until his death}} in 1558, holding the Bishopric of Rochester as well from 1554. His funeral, held at St Magnus, was a splendid affair, with chief mourners Sir William Petre, Sir William Garrard and Simon Lowe. These last two were parishioners here. Sir William Garrard, Master of the Haberdashers' Company, Alderman, Sheriff of London in 1553/53, Lord Mayor in 1555/56 and a Member of Parliament was born in the parish and buried at St Magnus in 1571.Simon Lowe was a Member of Parliament and Master of the Merchant Taylors' Company during the reign of Queen Mary and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurors</b> who acquitted Sir Nicholas Throckmorton in 1554.|$|E

25|$|On August 7, 1970, Jonathan Jackson, {{a heavily}} armed, 17-year-old African-American high-school student, gained {{control over a}} {{courtroom}} in Marin County, California. Once in the courtroom, Jackson armed the black defendants and took Judge Harold Haley, the prosecutor, and three female jurors as hostages. As Jackson transported the hostages and two black convicts away from the courtroom, the police began shooting at the vehicle. The judge and the three black men {{were killed in the}} melee; <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurors</b> and the prosecutor were injured. Although the judge {{was shot in the head}} with a blast from the shotgun, he also suffered a chest wound from a bullet that may have been fired from outside the van. Evidence during the trial showed, however, that either could have been fatal. The firearms which Jackson used in the attack, including the shotgun used to kill Judge Haley, had been purchased by Davis two days prior, and the barrel of the shotgun had been sawn off. Davis was found to have been corresponding with one of the inmates involved.|$|E
25|$|George {{appeared}} before the Old Bailey on 14 December 2007 and again {{pleaded not guilty to}} the murder. His retrial began on 9 June 2008. Initially there was a large amount of coverage in the press, especially of the prosecution portrayal of the defendant as being highly obsessive, lacking in social skills and a danger to women. The prosecution case differed from that of the first trial in that there was practically no scientific evidence as the evidence relating to the FDR was ruled inadmissible by the trial judge (Mr Justice Griffith Williams). There was much evidence of George's bad character which was admitted in the re-trial (at the discretion of the trial judge) {{as a result of the}} enactment of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 since the original trial. There were delays due to legal arguments and to the illnesses of the defendant and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurors.</b> For the defence William Clegg QC reminded the jury that evidence from three women from HAFAD (Hammersmith and Fulham Action on Disability) placed the defendant's arrival at their offices at 11:50 or 12:00, which, according to Clegg's argument, would have made it impossible for him to have committed a murder at Dando's house at 11:30 and then gone home (in the wrong direction) to change. Two neighbours who almost certainly saw the murderer immediately after the shooting had seen him go off in this direction, and later failed to identify George at an identification parade. The trial ended with George's acquittal on 1 August 2008.|$|E
500|$|After his conviction, Chandler {{was named}} by media {{as one of}} Florida's most notorious criminals. He said that his last words before his {{execution}} would be: [...] "Kiss my rosy red ass". In May 2011, comparisons were drawn between Chandler's case and trial in 1994, and the murder case and the upcoming trial of Casey Anthony. In both cases heightened media attention forced the selection of jurors who lived outside the county where the crime had been committed. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurors</b> in Chandler's 1994 trial, identified as Roseann Welton, said that: [...] "He scared some of the jurors when he would sit there and stare at you and have that stupid grin on his face.

500|$|Originally {{expected}} to last from three to six months, the trial stretched out much longer. [...] One local reporter called the Boston trial a [...] "long, complex and costly multidefendant extravaganza". After several jurors asked to be excused due {{to the length of}} the trial, the defense refused to proceed with fewer than 12 jurors, forcing the judge to declare a mistrial on May 4, 1988. According to <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurors,</b> all defendants, including LaRouche, would have been found not guilty. He told a reporter [...] "it seemed some of the government's people caused the problem", and that people working on behalf of the government [...] "may have been involved in some of this fraud to discredit the campaign." [...] At the time of the mistrial, a spokesperson said that the Constitutional Defense Fund, a LaRouche organization, had spent over $2million on legal and administrative expenses. Defense attorneys said they would appeal if the government sought a new trial.|$|E
500|$|Even {{after his}} {{conviction}} You continued to enjoy public support.

[...] You eventually did escape, early in the morning of January 14: one news report claimed the improvised lock to his cell door had been picked {{with the aid of a}} confederate. [...] You hid in the environs of South Bend for several days, during which he was hunted by a squad led by sheriff Thomas A. Roney. [...] On January 15 he was sighted by two men; the following day the county commissioners met and agreed to offer a reward of $200 for You's capture. On January 17 You was finally apprehended by a three-man posse. [...] You offered no resistance, and when asked how he escaped, said only that the door was open and he walked out.|$|E
500|$|The next day, Churchill filed {{a lawsuit}} in state court {{claiming}} that the firing was retribution for his expressing politically unpopular views. The jury in Churchill's suit for reinstatement weighed the university's claims of academic misconduct per jury instructions it received in the case. As Stanley Fish said, [...] "It was the jury’s task to determine whether Churchill’s dismissal would have occurred independently of the adverse political response to his constitutionally protected statements." [...] The jury found that the alleged misconduct would not have led to Churchill's firing and rejected the university's academic misconduct claim as the grounds for dismissal. On April 1, 2009, a Colorado jury found that Churchill had been wrongly fired, and awarded $1 in damages. As <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurors</b> said later in a press interview, [...] "it wasn't a slap in his face {{or anything like that}} when we didn't give him any money. It's just that [...] David Lane kept saying this wasn't about the money, and in the end, we took his word for that." [...] Churchill's counsel asked Chief Judge Larry J. Naves of the Denver District Court to order reinstatement in light of the verdict.|$|E

500|$|Sally-Anne Croft and Susan Hagan were extradited from Britain in 1994, {{and were}} convicted {{by a jury}} {{decision}} on July 28, 1995, for their roles in the assassination plot. They had unsuccessfully attempted to appeal their extradition from Britain to Home Secretary Michael Howard. During their trial the prosecution presented twenty-nine witnesses, including former followers of Rajneesh who placed both women in planning meetings where they discussed murdering Turner. David Berry Knapp, {{the former mayor of}} Rajneeshpuram, testified for the government in the case and implicated Croft and Hagan in the assassination conspiracy. Ava Kay Avalos (Ma Ava), a Rajneesh disciple, testified in the Croft case and stated that she {{had been part of the}} conspirators that plotted to assassinate Turner. In addition to Knapp and Avalos, co-conspirators Richard Kevin Langford, Phyllis Caldwell, and Alma Peralta testified in the case pursuant to conditional plea or immunity agreements. Both women were sentenced to five years in prison. Croft and Hagan did not testify during their trial. [...] "We hashed over everything – evidence, notes, evidence, notes. I think we did an absolutely fabulous job," [...] said <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurors.</b> At the sentencing for Croft and Hagan, the federal Judge Malcolm Marsh described them as [...] "people of obvious goodwill who had committed an extremely serious offense against the criminal justice system." [...] Prosecutor Tim Reardon called the conspiracy to commit assassination [...] "a deadly serious crime aimed at the heart of the criminal justice system." [...] Croft and Hagan were released from imprisonment at FCI Dublin, California, in April 1998, and returned to Britain.|$|E
