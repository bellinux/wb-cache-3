50|$|The ash {{whitefly}} (Siphoninus phillyreae) is {{a species}} of whitefly native to western Eurasia, India and North Africa but also introduced to North America. It is known in agriculture as a pest species of fruit trees, including pomegranates, pear and apple trees. It also feeds on ash and <b>ornamental</b> <b>pear</b> trees. Encarsia inaron {{is used as a}} biological control for it.|$|E
5000|$|An {{avenue of}} honour was {{originally}} located on Eramosa Road East where road {{was lined with}} plane trees in 1917. Each tree represented a resident who fought in World War 1 in Somerville. These trees were removed by the local Shire and footpaths laid in {{their place in the}} 1970s. In early 2013 a new avenue of honour of <b>ornamental</b> <b>pear</b> trees was planted along Station Street.|$|E
40|$|Pseudomonas syringae FF 5 causes {{stem tip}} dieback disease on <b>ornamental</b> <b>pear</b> (Pyrus calleryana). Its genome encodes a {{complete}} type III secretion system (T 3 SS) and HopAC 1, HopM 1, AvrE 1, HopI 1, HopAA 1, HopJ 1, HopAH 2, HopAH 1, HopAG 1, and HopAZ 1. Lacking detectable homologues of other T 3 SS effectors, it may encode novel, undiscovered effectors...|$|E
50|$|The {{property}} {{includes a}} 240-acre (0.97 km²) arboretum containing over 1,900 labeled species and cultivars of trees, shrubs, and other plants. The arboretum includes over 185 cultivars of American holly species. Other major collections include maples, crab apples, conifers (including dwarf conifers), oaks, buckeyes, ginkgoes, <b>ornamental</b> <b>pears,</b> and dogwoods. Specific attractions within the arboretum include {{the sun and}} shade trail, quiet garden, and garden pavilion. The original design for the arboretum was adopted in 1935, and has continued to be refined and improved over the years. In 1994, legislation was passed designating Bernheim as Kentucky's official arboretum. As {{is the case in}} most arboreta, the collection of leaves or clippings is not permitted.|$|R
50|$|Other {{species are}} used as {{rootstocks}} for European and Asian <b>pears</b> and as <b>ornamental</b> trees. <b>Pear</b> wood is close-grained and {{at least in the}} past was used as a specialized timber for fine furniture and making the blocks for woodcuts. The Manchurian or Ussurian Pear, Pyrus ussuriensis (which produces unpalatable fruit) has been crossed with Pyrus communis to breed hardier pear cultivars. The Bradford pear (Pyrus calleryana 'Bradford') in particular has become widespread in North America, and is used only as an ornamental tree, as well as a blight-resistant rootstock for Pyrus communis fruit orchards. The Willow-leaved pear (Pyrus salicifolia) is grown for its attractive, slender, densely silvery-hairy leaves.|$|R
40|$|The oriental aphid Schizaphis piricola (Matsumura) is {{recorded}} {{for the first}} time in Europe, on the <b>ornamental</b> <b>pear</b> tree Pyrus calleryana in landscaped areas in Madrid (Spain). Data on the morphology of the forms on primary host (apterous and alate fundatrigeniae and fundatrices), and their biology and distribution are given. The keys for identifying species of Schizaphis (Schizaphis) in the Iberian Peninsula are updated. Two species of aphids are also recorded {{for the first time}} on Pyrus calleryana: Schizaphis piricola and Aphis pomi...|$|E
40|$|Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae strain FF 5 is a {{phytopathogen}} {{associated with}} a rapid dieback on <b>ornamental</b> <b>pear</b> trees. P. syringae and the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa produce the exopolysaccharide alginate, a copolymer of mannuronic and guluronic acid. In P. aeruginosa, the response regulator AlgR (AlgR 1) is required for transcription of algC and algD, which encode key enzymes in the alginate biosynthetic pathway. In P. syringae FF 5, however, algR is not required for the activation of algD. Interestingly, algR mutants of P. syringae remain nonmucoid, indicating an undefined role for this response regulator in alginate biosynthesis. In the current study, the algC promoter region was cloned from P. syringae pv. syringae strain FF 5, and sequence analysis of the algC promoter indicated the presence of potential binding sites for AlgR and s 54, the alternative sigma factor encoded by rpoN. The algC promoter from P. syringae FF 5 (PsalgC) was cloned upstream of a promoterless glucuronidase gene (uidA), and the PsalgC–uidA transcriptional fusion was used to monitor algC expression in strains FF 5. 32 (algR mutant of P. syringae FF 5) and PG 4180. K 2 (rpoN mutant of P. syringae pv. glycinea PG 4180). Expression of the PsalgC–uidA fusion was fourfold lower in both the algR and rpoN mutants as compared to respective wild-type strains, indicating that both AlgR and s 54 ar...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the genetic and plasmid diversity within natural populations of Pseudomonas syringae isolated from three <b>ornamental</b> <b>pear</b> nurseries in eastern Oklahoma. The bactericide spray regimen differed at each nursery; copper and streptomycin, only copper, and no bactericides were applied at nurseries I, II, and III respectively. Resistance to copper (Cur) {{and resistance to}} streptomycin (Smr) were determined for 1, 938 isolates of P. syringae; isolates from nurseries I and II were generally Cur Sms; whereas most isolates from nursery III were Cus Sms. The plasmid profiles of 362 isolates were determined, and six, one, seven, and four plasmid profiles were obtained for Cur, Smr, Cur Smr, and Cus Sms isolates, respectively. All Smr plasmids contained sequences homologous to the strA and strB Smr genes from broad-host-range plasmid RSF 1010 and were associated with Smr transposon Tn 5393. Plasmids were placed into two groups {{on the basis of}} hybridization to the oriV and par sequences from pOSU 900, a cryptic plasmid in P. syringae pv. syringae. A total of 100 randomly chosen P. syringae isolates from nurseries I and III were analyzed for genetic diversity by using the arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR) technique. An analysis of chromosomal genotypes by AP-PCR revealed a high degree of genetic diversity among the isolates, and the results of this analysis indicated that the isolates could be clustered into two distinct groups. The plasmid profiles were specific to isolates belonging to particular AP-PCR groups. Within each AP-PCR group, identical plasmid profiles were produced by isolates that had different chromosomal genotypes, implying that plasmid transfer has {{played an important role in}} the dissemination of Cur and Smr within the populations studied...|$|E
