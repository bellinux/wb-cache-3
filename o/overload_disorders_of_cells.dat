40|$|Wilson disease (WD) is an {{autosomal}} recessive copper <b>overload</b> <b>disorder</b> <b>of</b> {{the liver and}} basal ganglia. WD is caused by mutations in the gene encoding ATP 7 B, a protein localized to the trans-Golgi network that primarily facilitates hepatic copper excretion. Current treatment comprises reduction of circulating copper by zinc supplementation or copper chelation. Despite treatment, {{a significant number of}} patients have neurological deterioration. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the possibility that defects arising from some WD mutations are ameliorated by drug treatment aimed at improvement of protein folding and restoration of protein function. This necessitated systematic characterization of the molecular consequences of distinct ATP 7 B missense mutations associated with WD. With the exception of p. S 1363 F, all mutations tested (p. G 85 V, p. R 778 L, p. H 1069 Q, p. C 1104 F, p. V 1262 F, p. G 1343 V, and p. S 1363 F) resulted in reduced ATP 7 B protein expression, whereas messenger RNA abundance was unaffected. Retention of mutant ATP 7 B in the endoplasmic reticulum, increased protein expression, and normalization of localization after culturing cells at 30 degrees C, and homology modeling suggested that these proteins were misfolded. Four distinct mutations exhibited residual copper export capacity, whereas other mutations resulted in complete disruption of copper export by ATP 7 B. Treatment with pharmacological chaperones 4 -phenylbutyrate (4 -PBA) and curcumin, a clinically approved compound, partially restored protein expression of most ATP 7 B mutants. CONCLUSION: These findings might enable novel treatment strategies in WD by directly enhancing the protein expression of mutant ATP 7 B with residual copper export activity. 1795. ...|$|R

40|$|To {{define the}} {{functional}} pathways regulating epithelial cell migration, {{we performed a}} genome-wide RNAi screen using 55, 000 pooled lentiviral shRNAs targeting ∼ 11, 000 genes, selecting for transduced cells with increased motility. A stringent validation protocol generated a set of 31 genes representing diverse pathways whose knockdown dramatically enhances cellular migration. Some of these pathways share features of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and together they implicate key regulators of transcription, cellular signaling, and metabolism, as well as novel modulators of cellular trafficking, such as DLG 5. In delineating downstream pathways mediating these migration phenotypes, we observed universal activation of ERKs and a profound dependence on their RSK effectors. Pharmacological inhibition of RSK dramatically suppresses epithelial cell migration induced by knockdown of all 31 genes, suggesting that convergence of diverse migratory pathways on this kinase may provide a therapeutic opportunity in <b>disorders</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> migration, including cancer metastasis...|$|R
