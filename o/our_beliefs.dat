25|$|Austrian {{psychiatrist}} Alfred Adler (1870–1937), who parted {{ways with}} Freud, emphasised {{the role of}} goals and motivation in his Individual Psychology. One of Adler's most famous ideas is {{that we try to}} compensate for inferiorities that we perceive in ourselves. A lack of power often lies at the root of feelings of inferiority. One way that religion enters into this picture is through <b>our</b> <b>beliefs</b> in God, which are characteristic of our tendency to strive for perfection and superiority. For example, in many religions God is considered to be perfect and omnipotent, and commands people likewise to be perfect. If we, too, achieve perfection, we become one with God. By identifying with God in this way, we compensate for our imperfections and feelings of inferiority.|$|E

[...] In 2006, he reaffirmed his previous statements and further opined, [...] "When I was growing up, if I liked , I listened to it — and I went to the shows. If I didn't, I didn't.

He said such criticism showed it is [...] "open season to kill us". [...] "We're happy to live our lives in anonymity, just quietly in our neighbourhoods in our low-key way. We're quite happy to have <b>our</b> <b>beliefs</b> questioned, ethically debated, and points of religion looked at. That's not a problem. We don't mind being criticised. We don't even mind being despised because of it. But once it starts to be charged that we're acting criminally, we're acting illegally, we're acting immorally, we're acting against society, then we felt that we really had to put our point of view. We felt that it wasn't fair to our members," [...] said Daniel Hales to The West Australian.|$|E

She has demonstrated support for inter-faith relations and has met with leaders of other churches and religions, including five popes: Pius XII, John XXIII, John Paul II, Benedict XVI and Francis. A personal note about her faith often features in her annual Christmas message broadcast to the Commonwealth. In 2000, she spoke about the theological significance of the millennium marking the 2000th anniversary of the birth of Jesus:To many of us, <b>our</b> <b>beliefs</b> are of fundamental importance. For me the teachings of Christ and my own personal accountability before God provide a framework in which I try to lead my life.

500|$|While {{discussing}} {{the origin of}} the title [...] "Rhythm Nation", Jackson stated she first uttered the phrase during a conversation with her producers. [...] "I thought {{it would be great if}} we could create our own nation" [...] adding that it would be [...] "one that would have a positive message and that everyone would be free to join." [...] She based the idea on the prevalence of various youth groups and organizations that are formed as a means of creating a common identity. The usage of the number [...] "1814" [...] represents the year the national anthem [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] was written. Rolling Stone emphasized the core concept is further explored in the album's opening pledge (the first track of the recording), which states: [...] "We are a nation with no geographic boundaries, bound together through <b>our</b> <b>beliefs.</b> We are like-minded individuals, sharing a common vision, pushing toward a world rid of color-lines."

Whereas evolutionary science already acknowledges that cognitive processes are unreliable, including the fallibility of the scientific enterprise itself, Plantinga's hyperbolic doubt is no more a defeater for naturalism than it is for theistic metaphysics founded upon a non-deceiving God who designed the human mind: [...] " [...] can construct a non-question-begging argument that refutes global skepticism." [...] Plantinga's argument has also been criticized by philosopher Daniel Dennett and historian Richard Carrier who argue that a cognitive apparatus for truth-finding can result from natural selection.|$|E

2500|$|Hume {{maintained}} that all knowledge, {{even the most}} basic beliefs about the natural world, cannot be conclusively established by reason. [...] Rather, he maintained, <b>our</b> <b>beliefs</b> are more a result of accumulated habits, developed in response to accumulated sense experiences. Among his many arguments Hume also added another important slant to the debate about scientific method — that of the problem of induction. [...] Hume argued that it requires inductive reasoning to arrive at the premises for the principle of inductive reasoning, and therefore the justification for inductive reasoning is a circular argument. Among Hume's conclusions regarding the problem of induction {{is that there is no}} certainty that the future will resemble the past. [...] Thus, as a simple instance posed by Hume, we cannot know with certainty by inductive reasoning that the sun will continue to rise in the East, but instead come to expect it to do so because it has repeatedly done so in the past.|$|E
2500|$|In {{relation}} to apartheid, Schwarz argued that Judaism was fundamentally opposed to segregation, and that [...] "If we rationalise or condone discrimination against one group, we have compromised our principles {{and we are}} then not true to <b>our</b> <b>beliefs</b> or our history". He also argued that violent change could ultimately lead to a nondemocratic government, incompatible with Jewish ethics and {{with the interests of}} the Jewish community. He emphasized that Jews needed not only a democratic society for all, but also [...] "The right to follow [...] own religion and love for Israel freely." [...] He was assured in private meetings by Israeli Prime Minister's Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Shamir that Jews in South Africa would not become isolated and links with Israel would be maintained. He played an increasingly important role on the Jewish Board of Deputies from the 1970s, serving as chairman of its committee on international relations and often acting as spokesman for the board to Jewish agencies abroad. In 2005, he was made an honorary vice-president of the board, and remained active until his death.|$|E
2500|$|Kant had {{distinguished}} theoretical from practical reason. Rationality theorist [...] Jesús Mosterín makes {{a parallel}} distinction between {{theoretical and practical}} rationality, although, according to him, reason and rationality are not the same: reason would be a psychological faculty, whereas rationality is an optimizing [...] strategy. Humans are not rational by definition, but they can think and behave rationally or not, depending on whether they apply, explicitly or implicitly, the strategy of theoretical and practical rationality to the thoughts they accept and to the actions they perform. Theoretical rationality has a formal component that reduces to logical consistency and a material component that reduces to empirical support, relying on our inborn mechanisms of signal detection and interpretation. [...] Mosterín distinguishes between involuntary and implicit belief, on the one hand, and voluntary and explicit acceptance, on the other. Theoretical rationality can more properly be said to regulate our acceptances than <b>our</b> <b>beliefs.</b> Practical rationality is the strategy for living one’s best possible life, achieving your most important goals and your own preferences in as far as possible. Practical rationality has also a formal component, that reduces to Bayesian decision theory, and a material component, rooted in human nature (lastly, in our genome).|$|E

Second, the more recent the observations we draw on, the stronger <b>our</b> <b>belief</b> in the conclusion. Third, the longer and more discontinuous a line of reasoning, the weaker <b>our</b> <b>belief</b> in the conclusion. Fourth, irrational prejudices can be formed by overgeneralizing from experience: the imagination is unduly influenced by any [...] "superfluous circumstances" [...] that have frequently been observed to accompany the circumstances that actually matter. And paradoxically, {{the only way to}} correct for the pernicious influence of [...] "general rules" [...] is to follow other general rules, formed by reflecting on the circumstances of the case and our cognitive limitations.

2500|$|Guderian {{argued that}} the tank would be the decisive weapon of the next war. [...] "If the tanks succeed, then victory follows", he wrote.

[...] Addressing the faster rate at which defenders could reinforce an area than attackers could penetrate it during the First World War, Guderian wrote that [...] "since reserve forces will now be motorized, the building up of new defensive fronts is easier {{than it used to}} be; the chances of an offensive based on the timetable of artillery and infantry co-operation are, as a result, even slighter today {{than they were in the}} last war." [...] He continued, [...] "We believe that by attacking with tanks we can achieve a higher rate of movement than has been hitherto obtainable, and—what is perhaps even more important—that we can keep moving once a breakthrough has been made." [...] Guderian additionally required that tactical radios be widely used to facilitate co-ordination and command by having one installed in all tanks.|$|E

[...] Bannon {{went on to say}} [...] "I believe we've come partly off-track in the years since the fall of the Soviet Union and we're starting now in the 21st century, which I believe, strongly, is a crisis both of our church, a crisis of our faith, a crisis of the West, a crisis of capitalism. And we're at the very beginning stages of a very brutal and bloody conflict, of which if the people in this room, the people in the church, do not bind together and really form what I feel is an aspect of the church militant, to really be able to not just stand with <b>our</b> <b>beliefs,</b> but to fight for <b>our</b> <b>beliefs</b> against this new barbarity that's starting, that will completely eradicate everything that we've been bequeathed over the last 2,000, 2,500 years." [...] Bannon maintained that [...] "the West" [...] was successful due to a capitalism based on [...] "the underlying spiritual and moral foundations of Christianity and, really, Judeo-Christian belief." [...] Which was under threat from [...] "state-sponsored capitalism... you see in China and Russia.", from [...] "Ayn Rand or Objectivist School of libertarian capitalism", and from [...] "immense secularization of the West... the overwhelming drive of popular culture is to absolutely secularize this rising iteration [...]" [...] Bannon held that the undermining of [...] "enlightened capitalism", and the loss of [...] "Judeo-Christian belief" [...] he held it was based on, were in dangerous decline right as [...] "we are in an outright war against jihadist Islamic fascism" [...] which includes Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, Boko Haram [...] "and other groups that will eventually partner with ISIS in this global war". Bannon called on Christian capitalists to examine the purpose of their wealth and if divine providence was calling on them [...] "to actually be a creator of jobs and a creator of wealth...and make sure that we are reinvesting that back into positive things... bind together as partners with others in other countries" [...] which would better prepare the West at these [...] "the very beginning stages of a global conflict".|$|E
