5|$|During {{a period}} of ten years {{spanning}} from 1870 to 1880, much of Romney's intellectual life centered on Literary Hall.

Literary Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 29, 1979 and, as of 2004, it is occasionally open to the public. The society's remaining records, dating as early as 1819, remain on display there.|$|E
