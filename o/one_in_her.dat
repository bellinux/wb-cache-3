25|$|She {{continued}} her {{study at the}} Fukien Christian University, which was a top university {{at that time in}} China. She graduated at the age of 22 from this university and earned the bachelor's degree in Physics. Because she was the best <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> class and this university wanted to hire some women, she got the chance to stay in this university and work for 8 years. For the first four years, she worked as an assistant to teach some fundamental courses such as mechanism. She taught so well that many students who were not in this class wanted to listen to her courses. After that she wrote a book named Course for Experiments in Optics and got the certification as a professor. Fukien Christian University had many exchange programs with New York University at that time and many teachers who worked more than 2 years could get the chance to study abroad. However, because she was not a Christian, the person in charge of this program didn’t give her the chance. So she applied for Dickinson College and got a full scholarship by the help of her workmate named Lairong Li.|$|E

It was produced by Quintanilla III and Argentine music producer Bebu Silvetti. The song {{was intended to be}} one of three studio tracks for Selena's Live! album. Astudillo and Quintanilla III had spent an hour writing a song together. They wanted to write a song on a topic that many women face with their boyfriends. Quintanilla III had wanted to empower women, letting them know that they should hold their heads up and remember that life goes on. Selena favored the lyrical content and central theme, a common <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> songs. [...] "La Llamada" [...] was recorded in Corpus Christi, Texas, at Selena's father and manager Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.'s recording studio Q-Productions.

500|$|Honey pays {{homage to}} some of Nagai's other creations, such as the Mazinger and Devilman series; the first two episodes alone include many cameos. [...] The first shows Mayor Light and Chokkei in a picture with {{characters}} from Nagai's Harenchi Gakuen, Iyahaya Nantomo, and Oira Sukeban, while Devilman titular character appears as a gargoyle. In the second, a scene in a downtown market in Cosplay City has cameos from Hige Godzilla from Harenchi Gakuen and Naojiro Abashiri from The Abashiri Family; a scene in Honey's bedroom shows a bust of Mazinger Z and a framed picture of her father, Dr. Kisaragi; and several scenes show Mazinger Z Sayaka Yumi, The Abashiri Family Kikunosuke, and an unnamed character from Kekkō Kamen as they get turned into plastic-coated statues. Cutie Honey's skin-tight, full-body costume uses the same design and tricolor (blue, black, and red) scheme as that of Nagai's original manga, but its chest opening—with rounded side edges—resembles the <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> 1973 anime attire. The opening sequence used {{in the first four}} episodes shows versions of Honey's original seven forms in the TV series: Kisaragi, Hurricane, Misty, Idol, Flash, Fancy, and Cutie. Danbei's techniques parody those of Nagai's super robots Mazinger Z and Grendizer. Later episodes feature appearances by Akira Fudo of Devilman and Professor Kabuto of Mazinger Z. In episode 7, Honey transforms herself into Kouji Kabuto. The title sequence of episodes 5 through 8 features Sirene, Devilman's nemesis, and Akira Fudo of Devilman along with Mazinger Z's Juzo Kabuto. Devilman can be briefly seen as one of the back-up guitarists for the one-time antagonist Saline in episode 3.|$|E

[...] Nancy C. Parrish, author of the 1998 book Lee Smith, Annie Dillard, and the Hollins Group: A Genesis of Writers, notes that despite its having been written in the first person, Pilgrim is not necessarily autobiographical. [...] The narrator, [...] "Annie Dillard", therefore becomes a persona through which the author can experience and describe [...] "thoughts and events that the real Annie Dillard had only heard about or studied or imagined." [...] Critic Suzanne Clark also points to the [...] "peculiar evasiveness" [...] of Dillard-the-author, noting that [...] "when we read Annie Dillard, we don't know who is writing. [...] There is a silence in the place where there might be an image of the social self—of personality, character, or ego". [...] While most critics assume that the narrator is female, mostly due to the autobiographical elements of the book and the assumption that the narrator is Dillard herself, Clark questions whether the narrator is male. [...] Stating that Dillard uses [...] "a variety of male voices, male styles" [...] throughout the book, Clark asks, [...] "When Dillard quit writing Pilgrim at Tinker Creek in the persona of a fifty year old man, did she then begin to write as a woman?" ...|$|E
