5|$|Careful {{selection}} of a spouse was important to maintain the royal status of a family: depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> the land in question, if a prince or king was to marry a commoner who had no royal blood, even if the first-born was acknowledged as {{a son of a}} sovereign, he {{might not be able to}} claim any of the royal status of his father.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the 1982 United Nations Convention <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> the Sea (UNCLOS) the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of many coastal nations was increased from 12 to 200 Nmi. The sudden expansion of responsibility dramatically increased the area of ocean requiring surveillance, monitoring and policing by these nations, increasing the strain on existing maritime patrol resources, and highlighting the need for countries without a maritime patrol force to obtain one, especially in the South West Pacific area.|$|E

Singapore had duties to investigate hazards to navigational safety and to publish information about such hazards in its capacity as a lighthouse operator, {{and under the}} United Nations Convention <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> the Sea and the Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea. Therefore, by investigating and reporting on shipwrecks and maritime hazards within Pedra Branca's territorial waters Singapore had acted in accordance with best practice and not à titre de souverain. The circumstances of the particular investigations also meant that Singapore's ability to carry them out was not based on its sovereignty over the island.|$|E

5|$|The 1979 Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) is {{the only}} global {{organization}} that conserves {{a broad range of}} animals, of which includes marine mammals. Of the agreements made, three of them deal with the conservation of marine mammals: ACCOBAMS, ASCOBANS, and the Wadden Sea Agreement. In 1982, the United Nations Convention <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> the Sea (LOSC) adopted a pollution prevention approach to conservation, which many other conventions at the time also adopted.|$|E
5|$|When Flem D. Sampson {{was elected}} {{governor}} in 1927, he appointed Willis {{to fill his}} seat on the Kentucky Court of Appeals. In 1928, Willis was elected to a full four-year term representing the Court's Seventh Appellate District. Holding a state-level office increased his political stature, as did revising Thornton <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> Oil and Gas, a six-volume law reference, during his time on the bench. His political image was not badly tarnished when he lost his seat on the court to Alex Ratliff during the Democratic surge that swept Franklin D. Roosevelt into the presidency in 1932. Following this defeat, {{he returned to his}} private practice.|$|E
5|$|The {{porbeagle}} {{is listed}} on Annex 1 (Highly Migratory Species) of the UN Convention <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> the Sea (UNCLOS) and on Annex 1 of the Conservation of Migratory Species (CMS; {{also known as}} the Bonn Convention) Migratory Shark Memorandum of Understanding. This species benefits from bans on shark finning instituted by several nations and supranational entities, including Canada, the United States, Brazil, Australia, the European Union, and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Although the Animals Committee of the UN Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) recommended additional conservation actions for the porbeagle, CITES rejected proposals to list the species in 2008 and again in 2010. In March 2013, the porbeagle was listed on Appendix II of CITES, allowing for increased regulation in the international trade of this species.|$|E

He became interested in politics, but his early races for office were unsuccessful with the exception of his four-year stint as city solicitor for Ashland, Kentucky. Finally in 1927, newly elected governor Flem D. Sampson appointed Willis to the Kentucky Court of Appealsthen the court of last resort in the state. Willis went on to win a full four-year term on the court in 1928, and distinguished himself by revising Thornton <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> Oil and Gas, a six-volume law reference.
