5|$|Some historians {{dispute the}} degree to which the Akutan Zero {{influenced}} the outcome of the air war in the Pacific.

5|$|Antoinism {{believes}} in a dualistic universe {{composed of a}} spiritual world governed by the law of God or consciousness, and of a corporal world, governed by natural laws, in which matter is an illusion perceived by the imagination generated by intelligence. The man combines in himself both worlds, as he has a physical body and a divine consciousness. In Antoinist views, the importance of human laws and science is weakened as they are based not on consciousness, but <b>on</b> <b>intelligence.</b> The view of the matter is, however, not considered a sin, but an error that causes suffering.|$|E

He supported the presidential candidacy and eventual presidency of Richard Nixon; however, he was critical of Nixon's attempt to control prices and wages. Initially, Goldwater defended Nixon in light of the Watergate scandal until August 5, 1974, when he withdrew his support. Nixon resigned from office four days later.|$|E

5|$|Action T4 was a {{programme}} {{of systematic}} {{murder of the}} physically and mentally handicapped and patients in psychiatric hospitals that mainly took place from 1939 to 1941 and continued {{until the end of}} the war. Initially the victims were shot by the Einsatzgruppen and others; in addition gas chambers and gas vans using carbon monoxide were used by early 1940. Under the provisions of a law promulgated 14 July 1933, the Nazi regime carried out the compulsory sterilisation of over 400,000 individuals labelled as having hereditary defects. More than half the people sterilised were those considered mentally deficient, which included not only people who scored poorly <b>on</b> <b>intelligence</b> tests, but those who deviated from expected standards of behaviour regarding thrift, sexual behaviour and cleanliness. Mentally and physically ill people were also targeted. The majority of the victims came from disadvantaged groups such as prostitutes, the poor, the homeless and criminals. Other groups persecuted and killed included Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals, social misfits and members of the political and religious opposition.|$|E
5|$|Based <b>on</b> <b>intelligence</b> {{acquired}} by a spy in Buell's army, Buckner advised Bragg that Buell was still ten miles from Louisville {{in the town}} of Mackville. He urged Bragg to engage Buell there before he reached Louisville, but Bragg declined. Buckner then asked Leonidas Polk to request that Bragg concentrate his forces and attack the Union army at Perryville, but again, Bragg refused. Finally, on October 8, 1862, Bragg's army—not yet concentrated with Kirby Smith's—engaged Maj. Gen. Alexander McCook's corps of Buell's army and began the Battle of Perryville. Buckner's division fought under General Hardee during this battle, achieving a significant breakthrough in the Confederate center, and reports from Hardee, Polk, and Bragg all praised Buckner's efforts. His gallantry was for naught, however, as Perryville ended in a tactical draw that was costly for both sides, causing Bragg to withdraw and abandon his invasion of Kentucky. Buckner joined many of his fellow generals in publicly denouncing Bragg's performance during the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Due to a miscommunication, the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPDC) {{failed to}} follow its own search {{parameters}} in Rock Creek Park, leaving Levy's body to decompose for a year. Furthermore, the MPDC had been informed, and soon dismissed, that Ingmar Guandique, already arrested for attacking women in Rock Creek Park, had confessed to attacking Levy. The MPDC instead put {{much of its}} focus on the revelation that Levy {{was having an affair}} with Congressman Gary Condit, a married Democrat then serving his fifth term representing California's 18th congressional district, and a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee <b>on</b> <b>Intelligence.</b> Condit had an overwhelming alibi (he was in meetings with the Vice President), was never named as a suspect by police and was eventually cleared of any involvement in the disappearance. However, due to the cloud of suspicion raised by the intense media focus on the missing intern and the later revelation of the affair, Condit lost his bid for re-election in 2002.|$|E

5|$|During the {{operations}} {{along the south}} coast of New Britain the AIB officers sought to discourage the Japanese from moving west of the Wide Bay area by circulating rumours among the local population that a large Australian base had been established at Jacquinot Bay. In reality no such base existed at this time. The AIB force continued to make guerilla attacks on Japanese positions until early October, when it was ordered to cease offensive operations and concentrate <b>on</b> <b>intelligence</b> gathering ahead of the landing of Australian infantry and support units at Jacquinot Bay. The AIB's operations from June to October were assisted by occasional air attacks and naval bombardments conducted by elements of the Allied air forces and navies.|$|E
5|$|Niémen {{was a new}} {{and fast}} ship, {{carrying}} 40guns and a large quantity of much needed naval supplies. However, in order to leave her home port of Brest, {{it was necessary to}} avoid contact with the British frigates that constantly watched the entrance to the harbour in search of enemy movement. In April 1809, these ships were HMS Amethyst and , loosely supported by other patrolling ships and tasked specifically with the capture of Niémen, acting <b>on</b> <b>intelligence</b> passed on by the Admiralty. When Niémen emerged on 5 April, she was immediately spotted and chased. Amethyst retained contact throughout the night and brought the French ship to action on the morning of 6 April. The ensuing battle was fiercely contested and both ships suffered severe damage and heavy casualties.|$|E
