On July 31, 1884, the D carried its first <b>ore</b> <b>shipment</b> from the Soudan Mine.

2500|$|By this time, {{the iron}} {{furnaces}} also boasted a substantial plant railroad. This {{began with the}} construction of a private wagon and rail bridge (which the company opened to the public) across the Lehigh River in 1847 to facilitate <b>ore</b> <b>shipment.</b> This rail line would connect with the Lehigh Valley Railroad in West Catasauqua in 1855, as well as the C when that line opened. (The Central Railroad of New Jersey would build a line along the Lehigh River in 1867 on the same side as the furnaces, giving Crane Iron yet another rail inlet and outlet.) The company received a supplement to its charter on March 15, 1872 (and was renamed simply the Crane Iron Company), allowing it to construct up to [...] of rail line to dispose of slag or connect with another railroad. The plant trackage ultimately totaled , and was worked by a number of 0-4-0 and 0-6-0 switchers, including one built on-site at the ironworks in the 1880s.|$|E
25|$|Economic decline {{began in}} the 1950s, when {{high-grade}} iron ore ran out on the Iron Range north of Duluth; <b>ore</b> <b>shipments</b> from the Duluth harbor had been critical to the city's economy. Low-grade <b>ore</b> (taconite) <b>shipments</b> continued, boosted by new taconite pellet technology, but <b>ore</b> <b>shipments</b> were lower overall.|$|R

2500|$|In 1848, the Jackson Mining Company was re-incorporated with Fairchild Farrand as president; Berry and Everett {{and most}} of the rest of the {{original}} investors lost control of the company. [...] In 1849, the company got a new president, Ezra Jones, and a new name: the Jackson Iron Company. In 1850, after numerous problems, the company gave up operation of their forge on the Carp River and leased the forge out. [...] The company was in a precarious financial position, and ceased work for a time on both their forge and mining operations. [...] However, production at the mine soon resumed, although company operations at the forge did not. [...] Jackson began utilising the Marquette forge; however, they did ship some iron ore directly: the first shipment of five tons went to New Castle, Pennsylvania. [...] The purity of this <b>ore</b> <b>shipment</b> attracted attention, and General Joel B. Curtis, president of the Sharon Iron Company of Sharon, Pennsylvania, travelled to Michigan to inspect the mine. [...] Liking what he saw, he purchased a controlling interest in the Jackson Iron Company, and for some years the Jackson location was known as the [...] "Sharon." ...|$|E

5000|$|Over 519 {{million tons}} of waste {{material}} and 690 {{million tons of}} iron ore {{have been removed from}} the mine area since <b>ore</b> <b>shipments</b> began in 1895.

5000|$|With <b>ore</b> <b>shipments</b> declining, the Port was revived in 1926 {{with the}} {{discovery}} of alluvial diamonds along the coast to the north and south of the town.

50|$|The museum also {{contains}} a large collection of photographs and artifacts {{from the time of}} copper <b>ore</b> <b>shipments</b> between 1854 and 1920.

50|$|The first {{shipment}} of iron ore {{for use in}} Australian Iron and Steel's new blast furnace was received from Whyalla, South Australia in 1928. The <b>ore</b> <b>shipment</b> of 5,500 tonnes had been mined by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company at Iron Knob in the Middleback Ranges.

50|$|The Hulett machine revolutionised iron <b>ore</b> <b>shipment</b> on the Great Lakes. Previous {{methods of}} {{unloading}} lake freighters, involving hoists and buckets and much hand labor, cost approximately 18¢/ton. Unloading with Huletts cost only 5¢/ton.

5|$|From {{the start}} of the war, a British {{blockade}} on shipments to Germany affected the Reich economy. The Germans were particularly dependent on foreign supplies of oil, coal and grain. To safeguard Swedish iron <b>ore</b> <b>shipments</b> to Germany, Hitler ordered an attack on Norway, which took place on 9 April 1940. Much of the country was occupied by German troops by the end of April. Also on 9 April, the Germans invaded and occupied Denmark.|$|R

50|$|Interested in the {{possibility}} of mining on Catalina Island from water well drilling and a brief episode of mining activity there in 1864, Renton established a mine at Blackjack Mountain in 1923. The first <b>ore</b> <b>shipment</b> was sent to smelters with about twenty tons of raw ore containing silver, lead and zinc. During the four years of operations, additional mines were opened up at Pebbly Beach, Renton Vein and Cherry Valley. From February to November 1926, they manufactured and shipped close to 3,000 tons of concentrates and received returns of over $90,000. When mining operations were closed due to an international drop in ore prices in 1927, DM had a 100-ton flotation mill in operation at White’s Landing, together with aerial cable tramways conveying the ore from the mines to the mill.|$|E

50|$|The first lot of ore {{from the}} Yellow Jacket mine {{and in fact}} from the Comstock ledge - yet shipped over the {{railroad}} was sent down yesterday to the Yellow Jacket mill on Carson River. There were seven car loads of it, about {{eight and a half}} tons to the load, not far from 60 tons. This was from the 700 foot level of the old north mine, and dumped directly into the cars, the railroad passing within a few feet of the shaft. It is low grade ore, assaying $26 or $28 to the ton, and will yield under the stamps not far from $17 per ton. It is ore which heretofore was considered too poor to work and was accordingly used to fill up drifts with.
