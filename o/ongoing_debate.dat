5|$|Animal Coloration, or in full Animal Coloration. An {{account of}} the {{principal}} facts and theories relating to the colours and markings of animals, is a book by the English zoologist Frank Evers Beddard, published by Swan Sonnenschein in 1892. It formed part of the <b>ongoing</b> <b>debate</b> amongst zoologists about the relevance of Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection to the observed appearance, structure, and behaviour of animals, and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|Living asteroids, the Neoasteroidea, are morphologically {{distinct}} from their forerunners in the Paleozoic. The taxonomy {{of the group}} is relatively stable but there is <b>ongoing</b> <b>debate</b> {{about the status of}} the Paxillosida, and the deep-water sea daisies, though clearly Asteroidea and currently included in Velatida, do not fit easily in any accepted lineage. Phylogenetic data suggests that they may be a sister group, the Concentricycloidea, to the Neoasteroidea, or that the Velatida themselves may be a sister group.|$|E

René Descartes rejected it as false, while modern researchers have attempted to recreate the effect using only the means that would have been available to Archimedes.

5|$|Ravalomanana's family origins are Merina, the island's {{largest and}} most {{politically}} prominent ethnic group. The Ravalomanana family tomb is outside the historic walls of the village, a placement that would typically indicate the family's origins lie with the hova (commoners' caste), rather than the andriana — the traditional ruling caste among the Merina that continues to exert considerable influence over political affairs in modern Madagascar. His later entry into the political sphere has made the question of his caste background one of popular interest and <b>ongoing</b> <b>debate</b> among the Malagasy public and press. Biographer Vivier (2007) maintains that the Ravalomanana family is andriana in origin.|$|E

5|$|The United States naval gunfire support {{debate is}} an <b>ongoing</b> <b>debate</b> among the United States Navy, Marine Corps, Congress, and {{independent}} {{groups like the}} United States Naval Gunfire Support Association over what role naval gunfire support and naval surface fire support (NSFS) should play within the navy and how such a role can best be provided.

5|$|There is an <b>ongoing</b> <b>debate</b> on the {{development}} of a new public transport structure, with monorails and light rail both being considered. A light rail link to Gosport was authorised in 2002 with completion expected in 2005, but it is unlikely that the project will be completed following the refusal of funding by the Department for Transport in November 2005. In April 2011, an article appeared in Portsmouth News suggesting a new scheme could be in the offing by running a light rapid transit system over the line to Southampton via Fareham, Bursledon, and Sholing, thus replacing the existing heavy rail services.|$|E
5|$|This {{new class}} of GRB-like events was first {{discovered}} through the detection of GRB 110328A by the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission on 28 March 2011. This event had a gamma-ray duration of about 2 days, much longer than even ultra-long GRBs, and was detected in X-rays for many months. It occurred {{at the center of}} a small elliptical galaxy at redshift z = 0.3534. There is an <b>ongoing</b> <b>debate</b> as to whether the explosion was the result of stellar collapse or a tidal disruption event accompanied by a relativistic jet, although the latter explanation has become widely favoured.|$|E

5|$|Beddard (1858–1925) was an English {{zoologist}} {{specializing in}} Annelid worms, but writing much more widely on topics including mammals and zoogeography. He also contributed articles on earthworms, leeches and nematode worms to the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica. His decision {{to write an}} accessible book on animal coloration falls into this pattern. Beddard wrote Animal Coloration {{at a time when}} scientists' confidence in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection was at a low ebb. Beddard's book was part of an <b>ongoing</b> <b>debate</b> among zoologists about how far natural selection affected animals, and how far other forces – such as the direct action of light – might be the causes of observed features such as the colours of animals. Edward Bagnall Poulton's far more strongly pro-Darwinian book The Colours of Animals had appeared just two years earlier in 1890.|$|E
5|$|During Taiwan under Japanese rule (1895–1945), {{the use of}} Pe̍h-ōe-jī was {{suppressed}} and it faced further countermeasures {{during the}} Kuomintang martial law period (1947–1987). In Fujian, use declined after {{the establishment of the}} People's Republic of China (1949) and in the early 21st century the system was not in general use there. Taiwanese Christians, non-native learners of Southern Min, and native-speaker enthusiasts in Taiwan are among those that continue to use Pe̍h-ōe-jī. Full native computer support was developed in 2004, and users can now call on fonts, input methods, and extensive online dictionaries. Rival writing systems have evolved, and there is <b>ongoing</b> <b>debate</b> within the Taiwanese mother tongue movement as to which system should be used. Versions of pe̍h-ōe-jī have been devised for other Chinese varieties, including Hakka and Teochew Southern Min.|$|E
5|$|Race is a {{significant}} force in politics, and many political parties are ethnically based. Affirmative actions such as the New Economic Policy and the National Development Policy which superseded it, were implemented to advance the standing of the bumiputera, consisting of Malays and the indigenous tribes who are considered the original inhabitants of Malaysia, over non-bumiputera such as Malaysian Chinese and Malaysian Indians. These policies provide preferential treatment to bumiputera in employment, education, scholarships, business, and access to cheaper housing and assisted savings. However, it has generated greater interethnic resentment. There is <b>ongoing</b> <b>debate</b> over whether the laws and society of Malaysia should reflect secular or Islamic principles. Islamic criminal laws passed by the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party {{with the support of}} UMNO state assemblymen in the state legislative assembly of Kelantan have been blocked by the federal government on the basis that criminal laws are the responsibility of the federal government.|$|E
