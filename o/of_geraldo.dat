2500|$|Inside it {{has three}} aisles {{covered by a}} wooden roof, a {{transept}} and five Eastern chapels in the apse. On the north wall outside of the cathedral there is the small Chapel of São Geraldo, in memory <b>of</b> <b>Geraldo</b> of Moissac, Archbishop of Braga (1096–1108), of early Romanesque design, {{that may be a}} remnant of the late 11th-century building. This chapel was left outside of the final cathedral, perhaps due to a change of design in the 12th century. The nave is essentially Romanesque thanks to a [...] "purifying" [...] reform in the 20th century that suppressed most later additions, although some original capitals of the columns have been lost. D.Afonso, son of King D.João I, is buried in a 15th-century tomb made of bronze, which {{can be seen in the}} nave of the Cathedral.|$|E
