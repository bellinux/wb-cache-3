The 1986 VL represented a substantial makeover of the VK and {{would be the last}} of the mid-size Commodores. Designers distanced the Commodore further away from its Opel origins, by smoothing the lines of the <b>outer</b> <b>body</b> and incorporating a subtle tail spoiler. A thorough redesign of the nose saw the Commodore gain sleek, narrow headlamps and a shallower grille, while the Calais specification employed unique partially concealed headlamps.|$|E

Although the capture origin of irregular satellites has been widely accepted, several previous studies suggest that Nereid was formed in the circumplanetary disk of Neptune and was ejected outward to the present location by Triton. Our time-series photometric observations confirm that the spin is stable and non-chaotic with a period of 11. 5 hr as indicated by Grav et al. (2003).
