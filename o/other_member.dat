50|$|The most {{distinct}} of Coimbra Filho's titi's features, from <b>other</b> <b>members</b> of the personatus group, include {{its black}} forehead, crown, and ear area, {{as well as}} a zebra-like pattern on the anterior of its back. Coimbra Filho's titi is also differentiated from <b>other</b> <b>members</b> of the personatus group by the shape of both its skull and its teeth. Compared to <b>other</b> <b>members</b> of its group, the skull is smaller, and shaped slightly differently. Its teeth are also more U-shaped, as opposed to the more V-shaped teeth exhibited by <b>other</b> <b>members</b> of the personatus group. It also features different dental topography on its upper first and second molars when compared to <b>other</b> <b>members</b> of the group.|$|R

5|$|Additionally, Spain has {{established}} {{an agreement with}} UNESCO known as the Spanish Funds-in-Trust. The agreement was signed on April 18, 2002 between Francisco Villar, Spanish Ambassador and Permanent Delegate to UNESCO, and the Director-General of UNESCO, Kōichirō Matsuura. The fund provides € 600,000 annually to a chosen program. Programs include helping <b>other</b> <b>member</b> states, particularly in Latin America, with projects such as nominations processes and assessing tentative sites. Spain served as {{the chair of the}} World Heritage Committee in 2008 and 2009, and in 2009 hosted the 33rd Session of the Committee in Seville, Andalusia.|$|E
5|$|Armenia {{announced}} {{its decision to}} join the Eurasian Customs Union in September 2013. President Serj Sargsyan announced the decision after talks with his Russian counterpart President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. The treaty enlarging the EEU to Armenia was signed on 9 October 2014. Armenia {{is the only country}} of the EEU that has no common border with the <b>other</b> <b>member</b> states of the union. Georgia guaranteed a free transit corridor for exporting its goods to the Eurasian Economic Union, Armenian deputy economy minister Emil Tarasyan said.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the new Congress in 1977, Mathias was in line for several potential committee promotions to ranking member. However, Mathias' outspoken criticism of the party in the previous election cycle aroused enmity amongst his colleagues. On the Judiciary Committee, Mathias had the most seniority of any <b>other</b> <b>member</b> except Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who already held another ranking membership on the Armed Services Committee. Only one ranking membership was allowed per senator, so Thurmond resigned his ranking membership on the Armed Services Committee to circumvent Mathias serving as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. Mathias was also prevented from assuming leadership positions on the Government Operations Committee following a power struggle, and on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights. On the latter subcommittee, Mathias had more seniority than any <b>other</b> <b>member.</b> However, party leaders were uneasy with the idea of allowing Mathias to team up with liberal Democrat and subcommittee chairman Birch Bayh, and voted instead for William L. Scott as ranking member.|$|E

5|$|Belarus was a {{founding}} member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Belarus has trade agreements with several European Union member states (despite <b>other</b> <b>member</b> states' travel ban on Lukashenko and top officials), including neighboring Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. Travel bans imposed by the European Union have been lifted in the past in order to allow Lukashenko to attend diplomatic meetings and also to engage his government and opposition groups in dialogue.|$|E
5|$|Reform of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) {{encompasses}} five key issues: {{categories of}} membership, {{the question of}} the veto held by the five permanent members, regional representation, the size of an enlarged Council and its working methods, and the Security Council-General Assembly relationship. Member States, regional groups and <b>other</b> <b>Member</b> State interest groupings developed different positions and proposals on how to move forward on this contested issue.|$|E

5000|$|The floral {{characteristics}} of the Clematoclethra {{are similar to the}} <b>other</b> <b>members</b> of the Actinidiaceae. The main floral differences between the Clematoclethra and the <b>other</b> <b>members</b> of the Actinidiaceae are that members of the Clematoclethra have 10 stamens instead of numerous stamens, and have a united, hollow, and fluted style as compared to a free style that the <b>other</b> <b>members</b> of the Actinidiaceae have. [...] Also, Clematoclethra is the only genus in the Actinidiaceae whose members are fully dioecious.|$|R
5|$|The {{characters}} (and {{their individual}} stories) are grouped into three main sub-plots. Angela and Duran oppose the Dragon Emperor, Hawk and Lise oppose the Dark Prince, and Kevin and Carlie oppose the Masked Mage. The main storyline {{is determined by}} the first character chosen, though there is significantly more character interaction and dialogue if the <b>other</b> <b>member</b> of the pair is also in the party.|$|E
5|$|The main {{criticism}} levelled at the EIHL is {{that the}} league is too expensive, an accusation given credence {{by the collapse of}} the London Racers mid season in 2005, and the continued financial problems experienced by a number of <b>other</b> <b>member</b> clubs (most notably Basingstoke Bison and Manchester Phoenix in 2008–09). Both the Edinburgh Capitals and Newcastle Vipers made public statements about their potentially perilous financial situations, casting further doubt over both their own, and the league's sustained viability.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way {{galaxy is}} a member of an {{association}} named the Local Group, a relatively small group of galaxies that has a diameter of approximately onemegaparsec. The Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy are the two brightest galaxies within the group; many of the <b>other</b> <b>member</b> galaxies are dwarf companions of these two galaxies. The Local Group itself is a part of a cloud-like structure within the Virgo Supercluster, a large, extended structure of groups and clusters of galaxies centered on the Virgo Cluster. And the Virgo Supercluster itself {{is a part of the}} Pisces-Cetus Supercluster Complex, a giant galaxy filament.|$|E

5|$|The childless Raymond III of Tripoli {{decided to}} {{bequeath}} his county to his godson, Raymond, who was Bohemond's elder brother. Bohemond III of Antioch sent Bohemond to Tripoli, because {{the union of}} Antioch and Tripoli under one monarch could jeopardize the defence of both crusader states. Raymond III of Tripoli ordered his vassals to do homage to Bohemond. The dying count, {{who was a member}} of the House of Toulouse, also prescribed that should an <b>other</b> <b>member</b> of his family come from Toulouse, Bohemond should cede the County of Tripoli to him. Raymond died in late 1187. Charters issued during the first years of Bohemond's rule imply that his elder brother was regarded a titular count of Tripoli for a while.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships of}} the Borneo shark are uncertain. Jack Garrick, in his 1982 morphological study, did not place {{it close to}} any <b>other</b> <b>member</b> of the genus. Leonard Compagno in 1988 tentatively grouped it with the smalltail shark (C. porosus), blackspot shark (C. sealei), spottail shark (C. sorrah), creek whaler (C. fitzroyensis), whitecheek shark (C. dussumieri), hardnose shark (C. macloti), and Pondicherry shark (C. hemiodon). The Borneo shark resembles the sharpnose sharks (Rhizoprionodon) in certain traits, for example the enlarged pores by its mouth. Nevertheless, other aspects of its morphology firmly place it within Carcharhinus.|$|E
5|$|The genus Phedina {{is thought}} to be an early {{offshoot}} from the main swallow lineage, although the striped plumage of its two species suggests a distant relationship with streaked African Hirundo species. The <b>other</b> <b>member</b> of the genus is the Brazza's martin P.brazzae, although in the past it has sometimes been suggested that Brazza's martin should be moved to its own genus, Phedinopsis, due to the significant differences in vocalisations and nest type from its relative. The nearest relation of the two Phedina martins is the banded martin, Riparia cincta, which appears not to be closely related to the other members of its current genus and resembles Brazza's martin in its nesting habits and calls. The current Association of European Rarities Committees (AERC)-recommended practice is to move the banded martin to its own genus as Neophedina cincta, rather than to merge it into Phedina, since the banded martin's larger size, different bill and nostril shape and non-colonial nesting are differences from the current Phedina species.|$|E
50|$|The spiny-footed lizard, like <b>other</b> <b>members</b> of {{the genus}} Acanthodactylus, may defend itself aggressively and bite tenaciously, if one tries to catch it.

50|$|Amaryllis, Crinum, Hippeastrum, Narcissus, {{and several}} <b>other</b> <b>members</b> of the {{amaryllis}} family Amaryllidaceae. This includes onion, garlic, and <b>other</b> alliums, <b>members</b> of the Amaryllid subfamily Allioideae.|$|R
50|$|The {{summer tanager}} (Piranga rubra), is a {{medium-sized}} American songbird. Formerly {{placed in the}} tanager family (Thraupidae), it and <b>other</b> <b>members</b> of its genus are now classified in the cardinal family (Cardinalidae). The species's plumage and vocalizations are similar to <b>other</b> <b>members</b> of the cardinal family.|$|R
5|$|The {{highlight}} of his school career came in April 2008, when he scored 227 not out during a record-breaking opening {{stand in a}} 50-over national schools game, adding 340 with Alex Barrow. He captained King's during the 2008 season, and improved on his batting totals from the previous two years, scoring 851 runs, over 250 more than any <b>other</b> <b>member</b> of the team. His batting average of 94.55 was the sixth highest amongst all school's batsmen reported in Wisden, while his high-score of 227* was the highest score they recorded. During that 2008 season, Buttler also played for Somerset Second XI. With captain Carl Gazzard keeping wicket {{in the majority of}} these matches, Buttler played purely as a batsman, although in his final match of the season for the team, he kept wicket and took six catches in the first-innings against Worcestershire Second XI. In the previous match, against Hampshire Second XI, Buttler had made 140 batting from number four.|$|E
5|$|Traits of O.hammondi that {{supported}} the latter placement include: a relatively short palate that does not extend behind the maxillary bones; simple posterolateral palatal pits; absence of a capsular process (a raising of the bone of the mandible, or lower jaw, at {{the back end of}} the incisor); and presence of the posteroloph on the upper third molar (a crest {{at the back of the}} tooth). In these characters, O.hammondi differs from many or most Oryzomyini and is similar to some species outside Oryzomyini, but all traits of O.hammondi are present in at least one <b>other</b> <b>member</b> of the tribe. Traits shared by O.hammondi and Oecomys included: tail with the same coloration above and below (unicolored); parietal bones extending to the sides of the skull; narrow zygomatic plate, without a zygomatic notch; posteroloph present on upper third molar; mesoflexus (a valley in the molar crown in front of the mesoloph crest) on upper second molar not divided in two.|$|E
5|$|When a pair {{of virtual}} {{particles}} (such as an electron and positron) is created {{in the vicinity of}} the event horizon, random spatial positioning might result in one of them to appear on the exterior; this process is called quantum tunnelling. The gravitational potential of the black hole can then supply the energy that transforms this virtual particle into a real particle, allowing it to radiate away into space. In exchange, the <b>other</b> <b>member</b> of the pair is given negative energy, which results in a net loss of mass-energy by the black hole. The rate of Hawking radiation increases with decreasing mass, eventually causing the black hole to evaporate away until, finally, it explodes.|$|E
