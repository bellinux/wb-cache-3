2500|$|In 1975 Larry and Sherry Carpenter {{purchased}} the Beacham Building from then-owners, Betty Rubles Bray, and Burkett H. Bray Jr. [...] A great-granddaughter of Braxton Beacham, [...] Mrs. Bray, refused {{to sell the}} theater by itself without also selling {{the rest of the}} building as a package. [...] An extensive $250,000 remodeling and restoration followed that included stunning multi-colored Art Deco revival style graphics painted over the facade and a large multi-story mural of a saxophone and its <b>open</b> <b>case</b> painted on the rear of the theater that faced west and was clearly visible from nearby Interstate 4. [...] Following the restoration the Carpenters opened Orlando's franchise location of The Great Southern Music Hall at the Beacham in 1976. [...] The 700-seat Great Southern Music Hall was a concert venue that hosted approximately 180 prominent national and regional acts at the Beacham. [...] The Great Southern Music Hall was occasionally still used as a movie theater that presented world cinema and classic Hollywood films by film directors such as John Carpenter, Federico Fellini, and Mel Brooks during the week. [...] John Lawson was the acting projectionist and served as stage director for concerts. [...] As The Great Southern Music Hall, only about seven music shows were unprofitable. [...] Nevertheless, [...] Orlando's Great Southern Music Hall closed in 1981 due to the rising costs of hosting concerts for notable musical acts and competition from larger venues.|$|E

30|$|Results: Fourteen <b>open</b> <b>cases</b> were {{compared}} to 13 Robot cases. The number of lymph nodes retrieved was 26 versus 32. Blood loss in the <b>open</b> <b>cases</b> was always over 1, 000  cc (median 2, 000  cc) while in the Robot cases the median loss was 300  cc. Mean hospital stay was reduced by 5  days.

Two complications occurred in the open group and one in the Robot group.|$|R

Operative time was more in laparoscopic versus <b>open</b> <b>cases</b> (79. 6 min vs. 53. 4 min (P < 0. 000 I). The differencein return to normal activi-ty and hospital stay days was not statisticallysignificant.

60|$|When I {{lost sight}} {{of her in the}} grove by the house, I turned and picked up the pages of the story of Tomaso and Lucilla, which I had dropped.

I put the inkstand in its case, closed it, and stood for some minutes holding it and thinking; but I did not carry it away with me as a memento. Drawing down a branch of the tree, I hung the little case securely by its handles to a twig, where it would be in full view of any one walking that way.|$|E

Mac was once more conscious, his eyes haggard, his face drawn with pain and flushed with fever; and Carthew remembered he had never been seen to, had lain there helpless, and was so to lie all night, injured, perhaps dying. But it was now too late; reason had now fled from that silent ship. If Carthew could get on deck again, it was {{as much as he could}} hope; and casting on the unfortunate a glance of pity, the tragic {{drunkard}} shouldered his way up the companion, dropped the case overboard, and fell in the scuppers helpless.|$|E
60|$|Oh well, {{never mind}} the rest of it. The {{physicians}} on watch were young fellows hardly out of the medical college, and they made a mistake--they {{had no way of}} measuring the eighth of a grain of morphine, so they guessed at it and gave him a vast quantity heaped {{on the end of a}} knife-blade, and the fatal effects were soon apparent. I think he died about dawn, I don't remember as to that. He was carried to the dead-room and I went away for a while to a citizen's house and slept off some of my accumulated fatigue--and meantime something was happening. The coffins provided for the dead were of unpainted white pine, but in this instance some of the ladies of Memphis had made up a fund of sixty dollars and bought a metallic case, and when I came back and entered the dead-room Henry lay in that <b>open</b> <b>case,</b> and he was dressed in a suit of my clothing. He had borrowed it without my knowledge during our last sojourn in St. Louis; and I recognized instantly that my dream of several weeks before was here exactly reproduced, so far as these details went--and I think I missed one detail; but that one was immediately supplied, for just then an elderly lady entered the place with a large bouquet consisting mainly of white roses, and in the centre of it was a red rose, and she laid it on his breast.|$|E
