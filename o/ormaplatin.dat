40|$|<b>Ormaplatin</b> (also {{known as}} tetraplatin) is a platinum-containing {{analogue}} which has recently undergone clinical trials. <b>Ormaplatin</b> may undergo conversion to dichloro(D,L-trans) - 1, 2 -diaminocyclohexaneplatinum(II) [P 1 Cl 2 (trans-dach) ]. The cisplatin-resistant murine lymphoma cell lines E 8 and E 5, {{were found to}} be cross-resistant to <b>ormaplatin</b> and PtCl 2 (trans-dach). We found an inverse rank correlation between drug resistance and drug accumulation for PtCl 2 (trans-dach) similar to our previous findings with cisplatin; however, accumulation of <b>ormaplatin</b> in the resistant cells was increased. <b>Ormaplatin</b> cytotoxicity appears to result primarily from extracellular conversion to PtCl 2 (trans-dach), since <b>ormaplatin</b> cytotoxicity was decreased under conditions where extracellular conversion to PtCl 2 (trans-dach) was minimised. Co-incubation with different inhibitors of energy metabolism resulted in a 65 - 70 % increase in PtCl 2 (trans-dach) accumulation in the parental cell line R 1. 1 and a 113 - 307 % increase in the resistant cell line E 5 which suggests that the decrease in accumulation in E 5 may be at least partly energy dependent. We conclude from these findings that cross-resistance to <b>ormaplatin</b> is associated with an energy-dependent decreased accumulation of PtCl 2 (trans-dach) in these cisplatin-resistant cell lines...|$|E
40|$|The diaminocyclohexane {{platinum}} (Pt(DACH)) derivatives <b>ormaplatin</b> and oxaliplatin {{have caused}} severe and dose-limiting peripheral sensory neurotoxicity {{in a clinical}} trial. We hypothesized that this toxicity could vary {{in relation to the}} biotransformation and stereochemistry of these Pt(DACH) derivatives. We prepared pure R,R and S,S enantiomers of <b>ormaplatin</b> (Pt(DACH) Cl 4), oxaliplatin (Pt(DACH) oxalato) and their metabolites (Pt(DACH) Cl 2 and Pt(DACH) methionine) and assessed their peripheral sensory neurotoxicity and tissue distribution in the rat and in vitro anti-tumour activity in human ovarian carcinoma cell lines. The R,R enantiomers of Pt(DACH) Cl 4, Pt(DACH) oxalato and Pt(DACH) Cl 2, induced peripheral sensory neurotoxicity at significantly lower cumulative doses (18 +/- 5. 7 vs 32 +/- 2. 3 micromol kg(- 1); P < 0. 01) and at earlier times (4 +/- 1 vs 6. 7 +/- 0. 6 weeks; P = 0. 016) during repeat-dose treatment than the S,S enantiomers. Pt(DACH) methionine enantiomers showed no biological activity. There was no difference between Pt(DACH) enantiomers in the platinum concentration in sciatic nerve, dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord, brain or blood {{at the end of each}} experiment. Three human ovarian carcinoma cell lines (41 M, 41 McisR and SKOV- 3) showed no (or inconsistent) chiral discrimination in their sensitivity to Pt(DACH) enantiomers, whereas two cell lines (CH- 1 and CH- 1 cisR) showed modest enantiomeric selectivity favouring the R,R isomer (more active). In conclusion, Pt(DACH) derivatives exhibit enantiomeric-selective peripheral sensory neurotoxicity during repeated dosing in rats favouring S,S isomers (less neurotoxic). They exhibited less chiral discrimination in their accumulation within peripheral nerves and in vitro anti-tumour activity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: Solute {{carriers}} (SLCs), {{in particular}} organic cation transporters (OCTs), have {{been implicated in}} the cellular uptake of platinum-containing anticancer compounds. The activity of these carriers may determine the pharmacokinetics and the severity of side effects, including neuro- and nephrotoxicity of platinum-based chemotherapy. As decreased drug accumulation is a key mechanism of platinum resistance, SLCs may {{also contribute to the}} development of resistance. Here, we define the role of hSLC 22 A 2 (OCT 2) in the cellular uptake of platinum compounds. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably expressing the hSLC 22 A 2 gene (HEK 293 /hSLC 22 A 2) were used in platinum accumulation studies. Following a 2 h exposure to various platinum compounds (100 microM), intracellular platinum levels were determined by flameless atomic absorption spectrometry. KEY RESULTS: HEK 293 /hSLC 22 A 2 cells, compared with HEK 293 /Neo control cells, displayed significant increases in oxaliplatin (28. 6 -fold), Pt[DACH]Cl(2) (20. 6 -fold), <b>ormaplatin</b> (8. 1 -fold), tetraplatin (4. 5 -fold), transplatin (3. 7 -fold) and cisplatin (1. 3 -fold), but not carboplatin. SLC 22 A 2 -mediated transport could be inhibited by 1 -methyl- 4 -phenylpyridinium. Furthermore, hSLC 22 A 2 -mediated oxaliplatin and cisplatin accumulation was time- and concentration-dependent, but non-saturable. Expression of hSLC 22 A 2 in HEK 293 cells resulted in enhanced sensitivity to oxaliplatin (12 -fold) and cisplatin (1. 8 -fold). Although, hSLC 22 A 2 mRNA expression was frequently found in ovarian cancer cell lines, its expression in clinical ovarian cancer specimens (n= 80) was low and did not correlate with the treatment outcome of platinum-based regimens. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The hSLC 22 A 2 drug transporter is a critical determinant in the uptake and cytotoxicity of various platinum compounds, particularly oxaliplatin...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown {{platinum}} drugs to {{differ in their}} effects on the peripheral nervous system. To test whether their differential toxicity was {{due to differences in}} their partitioning into the peripheral nervous system, we correlated the hydrophobicity, reactivity, tissue accumulation and neurotoxicity of a series of eight platinum analogues. Neurotoxicity was detected by measuring sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) in Wistar rats treated twice per week at the maximum tolerated dose. Tissue platinum concentrations were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Hydrophobicity (log P) was measured using an octanol-aqueous shake-flask method. The half-life of platinum drug binding to plasma proteins in vitro was determined. The cumulative dose causing altered SNCV ranged from 15 to > 2050 μmol kg− 1. Ranking of the compounds by their neurotoxic potency in rats (oxaliplatin >R,R -(DACH) PtC 4 > <b>ormaplatin</b> >S,S -(DACH) PtCl 4 >S,S -(DACH) Pt oxalato > cisplatin > carboplatin > JM 216) correlated with the frequency of neurotoxicity in patients (r> 0. 99;P carboplatin > oxaliplatin >R,R -(DACH) PtCl 4 ≈S,S -(DACH) PtCl 4 and did not correlate with neurotoxicity. Log P ranged from – 2. 53 to – 0. 16 but did not correlate with neurotoxicity. Log P correlated inversely with platinum accumulation in dorsal root ganglia (r 2 = 0. 99;P = 0. 04), sural nerve (r 2 = 0. 85;P = 0. 025), sciatic nerve (r 2 = 0. 98;P = 0. 0012), spinal cord (r 2 = 0. 97, P = 0. 018) and brain (r 2 = 0. 98, P = 0. 001). Reactivity correlated with neurotoxicity potency in rats (r 2 = 0. 89, P = 0. 0005) and with the frequency of neurotoxicity in patients (r 2 = 0. 99, P = 0. 0002). The hydrophilicity of platinum drugs correlates with platinum sequestration in the peripheral nervous system but not with neurotoxicity. Differences in the reactivity of platinum complexes accounts for some of the variation in their neurotoxicity. © 2000 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|E
