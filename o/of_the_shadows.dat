5|$|Epstein made {{numerous}} {{trips to}} London to visit record {{companies in the}} hope of securing a record contract, but many rejected him, including Columbia, Pye, Philips, Oriole, and most notoriously Decca. On 13 December 1961, at Epstein's invitation, Mike Smith of Decca travelled from London to Liverpool to watch the group at The Cavern Club, which led to an audition in London on 1 January 1962 (see The Beatles' Decca audition). Decca informed Epstein one month later that the audition tapes had been rejected. The Beatles later found out that Epstein had paid Decca producer Tony Meehan (ex-drummer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shadows)</b> to produce the studio recordings. While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he also approached Ron White, an EMI marketing executive, who contacted EMI producers Norrie Paramor, Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell, but they all declined to record the group. White could not contact EMI's fourth staff producer George Martin, as he was on holiday.|$|E

In a sample of developed and developing countries over the 1999 - 2007 period, we indeed report a negative relation between the tax burden and <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> economy, and a positive relation between inflation and <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> economy. We provide evidence that both are conditional on central bank independence and the exchange rate regime.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} how different tax systems and structures affect <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> economy.

Using comparative statics, we show that a measure <b>of</b> "coraplexity" <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tax system affects participation in <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> economy negatively, i. e., a more "complex" tax system implies, ceteris paribus, a smaller labor supply in <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> economy. Next, we analyze <b>the</b> determinants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> economy empirically for Austria. Various methods to estimate <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> economy are discussed. Empirical results for Austria obtained by using the currency demand approach are presented.

25|$|The Shadows, {{an ancient}} and {{extremely}} powerful race who have recently emerged from hibernation, are {{revealed to be}} the cause of a variety of mysterious and disturbing events, including the attack on the Narn outpost at the end of 2258. Centauri Ambassador Londo Mollari unknowingly enlists their aid through his association with their mysterious human representative Mr. Morden in the ongoing conflict with the Narn. The elderly and ailing Centauri emperor, long an advocate of reconciliation with the Narn, unfortunately has insufficient control to prevent others from instigating war against the Narn Regime. When the emperor dies suddenly during a peace mission to Babylon 5, a number of conspirators, including Ambassador Londo Mollari and Lord Refa, take control of the Centauri government by assassinating their opponents and placing the late emperor's unstable nephew on the throne. Their first act is to start open aggression against the Narn. After a full-scale war breaks out, the Centauri with the help <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shadows</b> through Londo eventually conquer Narn in a brutal attack involving mass drivers, outlawed weapons of mass destruction. Towards the end of the year, the Clark administration begins to show increasingly totalitarian characteristics, clamping down on dissent and restricting freedom of speech.
