25|$|One {{reason for}} the {{consistency}} of Goldsmith's aural resonance and signature sound is his long time professional association with orchestrator Arthur Morton. Their first collaboration was on the film, Take Her She's Mine. In 1965, Goldsmith was tapped to score the features, Von Ryan's Express and Morituri. He recruited Morton to serve as his orchestrator. Their bond for a unique and expressive sound was borne, and their friendship flourished. Goldsmith went on to compose the soundtracks for <b>Our</b> <b>Man</b> Flint, The Trouble with Angels (with Frank De Vol), The Blue Max, The Sand Pebbles, and Stagecoach, all in 1966. Morton was there providing his orchestration services, assisting Goldsmith in attaining his visionary sounds. Their partnership endured for over 30 years and included the notable scores for Planet of the Apes (1968), Patton (1970), Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970), Papillon (1973), Chinatown (1974), The Omen (1976), MacArthur (1977), Capricorn One (1978), Alien (1979), Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979), Poltergeist (1982), First Blood (1982), Under Fire (1983), The Russia House (1990). The final score that Arthur Morton orchestrated for Goldsmith was L.A. Confidential (1997).|$|E

O'Hara beat Lauren Bacall to the role as she was busy with other engagements. Though the film was critically acclaimed, Crowther of The New York Times felt that the characters of O'Hara and the daughter {{could have been made}} [...] "more humorous and spirited than they are". The following year, O'Hara appeared in the CBS television film, Mrs. Miniver, but despite some critics approving her performance, most thought that the remake was ill-timed and that she could not top Greer Garson's performance in the 1942 Oscar-winning film.|$|E
500|$|Goldfinger {{has been}} {{described}} as perhaps [...] "the most highly and consistently praised Bond picture of them all" [...] and after Goldfinger, Bond [...] "became a true phenomenon." [...] The success of the film led to the emergence of many other works in the espionage genre and parodies of James Bond, such as The Beatles film Help! in 1965 and a spoof of Ian Fleming's first Bond novel, Casino Royale, in 1967. Indeed, {{it has been said that}} Goldfinger was the cause of the boom in espionage films in the 1960s, so much so that in [...] "1966, moviegoers were offered no less than 22 examples of secret agent entertainment, including several blatant attempts to begin competing series, with James Coburn starring as Derek Flint in the film <b>Our</b> <b>Man</b> Flint and Dean Martin as Matt Helm".|$|E

(1968) and The Italian Job (1969). Stage and film opportunities he turned down in the 1950s included an invitation to compose a musical version of Pygmalion (two years before My Fair Lady was written), and offers of {{the roles of the}} king in the original stage production of The King and I, and Colonel Nicholson in the film The Bridge on the River Kwai. Invited to play the title role in the 1962 film Dr. No, he replied, [...] "No, no, no, a thousand times, no." [...] In the same year, he turned down the role of Humbert Humbert in Lolita, saying, [...] "At my time of life the film story would be logical if the 12-year-old heroine was a sweet little old lady." ...|$|E

They rowed on for all this, and even till they were past the point; which, <b>our</b> <b>men</b> seeing, they {{immediately}} let fly a shot, but fired {{a little ahead of}} them, so as not to hit the boat, and this brought them to a stop; so they lay upon their oars awhile, as if they were considering what to do, when <b>our</b> <b>men</b> perceived two boats more come off from the platform, likewise full of men, and rowing after the first.|$|R

500|$|The {{story was}} {{initially}} pitched to Echevarria by Robert Gillan, {{who was on}} the staff of Deep Space Nine as Assistant Script Coordinator. Echevarria was immediately convinced, and told Behr about the story who was equally as enthusiastic. In Gillan's original pitch, there wasn't a specific setting clearly set out, but Behr and Echevarria were sold on the idea that nothing went wrong with the holosuites — it was simply where the computer decided to store the information following a transporter accident. Producer Ronald D. Moore came up with the 1960s setting, as he felt it was appropriate since Garak was a spy for the Cardassian Obsidian Order. He wrote the teleplay, and based it on a variety of sources including James Bond, <b>Our</b> <b>Man</b> Flint, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and The Wild Wild West. He later explained that he [...] "loved all of them as a kid. They had a certain panache. I loved writing that episode." ...|$|E
500|$|Coward's music, writings, {{characteristic}} {{voice and}} style {{have been widely}} parodied and imitated, for instance in Monty Python, Round the Horne and Privates on Parade. Coward has frequently been depicted as a character in plays, films, television and radio shows, for example, in the 1968 Julie Andrews film Star! (in which Coward was portrayed by his godson, Daniel Massey), the BBC sitcom Goodnight Sweetheart and a BBC Radio 4 series written by Marcy Kahan in which Coward was dramatised as a detective in Design For Murder (2000), A Bullet at Balmain's (2003) and Death at the Desert Inn (2005), and as a spy in Blithe Spy (2002) and <b>Our</b> <b>Man</b> In Jamaica (2007), with Malcolm Sinclair playing Coward in each. On stage, characters based on Coward have included Beverly Carlton in the 1939 Broadway play The Man Who Came to Dinner. A play about the friendship between Coward and Dietrich, called Lunch with Marlene, by Chris Burgess, ran at the New End Theatre in 2008. The second act presents a musical revue, including Coward songs such as [...] "Don't Let's Be Beastly to the Germans".|$|E
500|$|Signing a {{contract}} with a publisher {{was a very difficult}} task for Monolith. Development {{had been going on for}} months, and the project had been approved by different publishers four times, before they were able to actually sign a deal with one. During this long time for finding a publishing partner, No One Lives Forever [...] "mutated constantly in order to please prospective producers and marketing departments. The game actually started off as a mission-based, anime-inspired, paramilitary action thriller intended as a spiritual sequel to Shogo and ended up as a 60s spy adventure in the tradition of <b>Our</b> <b>Man</b> Flint and countless other 60s spy movies and shows." [...] This final theme for the game was settled on through discussions with Fox Interactive, the final publisher of NOLF. (Parts of the initial [...] "paramilitary action thriller" [...] concept evolved into F.E.A.R., another Monolith game, released after the NOLF series, in 2005.) Monolith's producer for the game, Samantha Ryan said that before the deal was signed, [...] "here was a period where Monolith was two weeks from death. And Jace Hall closed the deal with Fox Interactive that basically saved the company." ...|$|E

Upon the noise of these guns, abundance of men came running down to the shore from among the trees; and <b>our</b> <b>men</b> could easily perceive that they were Europeans, though they knew not of what nation; however, <b>our</b> <b>men</b> hallooed to them as loud as they could, and by-and-by they got a long pole, and set it up, and hung a white shirt upon it for a flag of truce. They on the other side saw it, by the help of their glasses, too, and quickly after <b>our</b> <b>men</b> see a boat launch off from the shore, as they thought, but it was from another creek, it seems; and immediately they came rowing over the creek to <b>our</b> <b>men,</b> carrying also a white flag as a token of truce.|$|R
500|$|Richardson {{turned down}} the role of Estragon in Peter Hall's premiere of the English {{language}} version of Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot in 1955 and later reproached himself for missing {{the chance to be}} in [...] "the greatest play of my generation". He had consulted Gielgud, who dismissed the piece as rubbish, and even after discussing the play with the author, Richardson could not understand the play or the character. Richardson's Timon of Athens in his 1956 return to the Old Vic was well received, as was his Broadway appearance in The Waltz of the Toreadors for which he was nominated for a Tony Award in 1957. [...] He concluded the 1950s with two contrasting West End successes, Robert Bolt's Flowering Cherry, and Graham Greene's The Complaisant Lover. The former, a sad piece about a failed and deluded insurance manager, ran for 435 performances in 1957–58; Richardson co-starred with three leading ladies in succession: Celia Johnson, Wendy Hiller and his wife. Greene's comedy was a surprise hit, running for 402 performances from June 1959. Throughout rehearsals the cast treated the love-triangle theme as one of despair, and were astonished to find themselves playing to continual laughter. During the run, Richardson worked by day on another Greene work, the film <b>Our</b> <b>Man</b> in Havana. Alec Guinness, who played the main role, noted [...] "the object-lesson in upstaging in the last scene between Richardson and Noël Coward", faithfully captured by the director, Carol Reed.|$|E
