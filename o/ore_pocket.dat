25|$|During the 1850s, Marquette {{was linked}} by rail to {{numerous}} mines {{and became the}} leading shipping center of the Upper Peninsula. The first <b>ore</b> <b>pocket</b> dock, designed by an early town leader, John Burt, was built by the Cleveland Iron Mining Company in 1859. By 1862, the city had a population of over 1,600 and a soaring economy.|$|E
5000|$|The first ore in {{the area}} was {{discovered}} in July 1891 by a mountain shepherd, who brought a curiously dense rock to show his foreman. The foreman recognized it as silver-bearing galena {{and took it to}} be assayed in Ogden. The sample was 45% lead, with a silver concentration of 400 ounces per ton. The two quietly registered a mining claim, but the secret got out. Several more high-grade <b>ore</b> <b>pockets</b> were found, and a silver rush began. This was the first major Utah mining claim ever found north of Salt Lake City, and many northern Utahns became interested. By August 1891 more than 1000 miners had arrived, and the number soon reached 1500. Lines of cabins and stores stretched along either side of the creek, forming a town called La Plata (Spanish for [...] "silver"). There were 60 - 70 buildings in all, including two stores, saloons, a bank, and a post office.|$|R
50|$|Kargaly {{belongs to}} the class of {{deposits}} situated in sandstone and slate. These large deposits and insignificant ore locations form a long and wide north-south strip of approximately two thousand km. in width, stretching alongside the western outlying regions of the Ural Mountains. Kargaly {{is located in the}} southern part of this vast territory. The ore-bearing strata, consisting mainly of crag and sandstone, very often contain the remains of trees of the Perm geological period. Kargaly's giant pocket is the richest load of copper minerals in the vast Ural zone adjacent to copper-bearing sandstone. The ores occur at different depths, beginning with outcroppings of surface deposits, easily noticeable on the sides of ravines, and ending with those situated 80-90 m deep. The ore-bearing streams are scattered among the sandstone and clue rocks, sometimes appearing as short and broken veins. The size of the <b>ore</b> <b>pockets</b> and pods differs, from several centimeters to ten or more meters in length. Disordered and random distribution of these ore seats must have caused chaotic searches for these deposits by miners in the ancient Bronze Age, as it did for much later miners in the 18th and 19th centuries.|$|R
40|$|The Oxec copper {{deposit of}} Upper Cretaceous age {{lies in the}} serpentinite body that makes up the Sierra de Santa Cruz, Guatemala. Recognition of the ore host rocks as chloritized, silicified, and sheared pillow basalts, {{identification}} of a nearly complete ophiolite assemblage, and an elucidation of the structure indicate that this massive Fe-Cu sulfide deposit is of the ophiolite copper type. In the mine vicinity, the ultramafic-mafic assemblage consists of serpentinized periodo-rite, a sheeted dike complex, a hydrothermally altered lower pillow lava sequence (ore horizon), and an upper pillow lava sequence. Chemical analyses of the pillow basalts and sheeted dikes reveal an ocean-floor tholeiitic origin. Comparison with ocean-floor tholeiites indicates that the Oxec assemblage is strongly enriched in Na 20 and H 20, strongly depleted in CaO, and slightly depleted in FeO, an indication of ocean-floor metamorphism. The widespread assemblage pidote-albite-chlorite-actinolite-sphene i the altered pillows and dikes indicates that greenschist facies metamorphic conditions were attained. Pillow basalts and dikes intimately associated with the ore are strongly depleted in NaeO and CaO and strongly enriched in FeO and H 20, an indication that they were subject to local intense hydrothermal alteration. The mineralization in the zone of massive ore consists of pyrite, chalcopyrite, and pyrrhotite. Traces of early hematite and magnetite indicate initial oxidizing conditions {{at the onset of}} sulfide deposition. A small, highly silicified breccia zone with pyrite and chalcopyrite may represent he top of a stockwork feeder zone. Late dikes invaded the deposit and disaggregated it into numerous <b>ore</b> <b>pockets.</b> The characteristics of this deposit are consistent with a Cyprus-type genetic model...|$|R
50|$|In 1920, mineral {{extraction}} {{was reported in}} the Rif in the area of Melilla, where there were three iron mines as well as one working lead and zinc ore. The most important of these was the Compañía Española de Minas del Rif S.A., working large superficial masses of specular hematite. Setolazar Company, working the Navarrete mine, had an extensive concession estimated to contain more than 4 million tons of iron ore. The Compania Norte Africano had a monthly output of 200 tons of lead <b>ore</b> from <b>pockets</b> near the surface, in addition to calamine estimated to contain 40% zinc. Deposits of specular and dark hematite were recorded west of Melilla, within 5 - 6 km of the sea. Brown hematite was noted in the area of Tetuan.|$|R
50|$|In mining, high grading {{refers to}} mining out the {{portions}} of the orebody that has the highest grade of material to be mined, however it may also refer to the concealment and theft of valuable gold or silver ore by miners for personal profit. Common in the United States in the late 19th century and early 20th century, high graders would usually conceal gold <b>ore</b> in a <b>pocket</b> or lunch pail, or within the body, and later attempt to fence it on the black market.|$|R
50|$|By 1860, {{the volume}} of ore shipped through the Soo Locks had {{increased}} to 114,401 tons, only to fall again to 49,909 tons in 1861 after the American Civil War broke out. However, by 1862, an additional wooden dock had been constructed at Marquette, this time featuring an elevated railway trestle for ore jennies to discharge <b>ore</b> into <b>pockets.</b> In 1911 another iron ore loading dock was built, where the wooden frame work was replaced with a concrete and steel frame work. The new iron ore loading dock at Marquette, was 1200 feet long; 75 feet high; and 60 feet wide. Four railroad tracks ran across the top and there was storage space inside the bottom concrete part for 60,000 tons of iron ore. The new iron ore loading dock incorporated a concrete bottom half with and a light steel frame work on top; doing away with the wooden supports used in previous iron ore docks. While more expensive than previous iron ore loading docks, that used both iron and wood frame works, the builders claimed the new construction would hold up far longer than the old construction method. Schooners now started to feature regularly spaced hatch covers, speeding up loading. However steamers of the day were not well adapted for bulk cargoes such as iron ore. They did not have hatches through their decks. Instead they had gangways through the sides. So ore shipments were loaded via wheelbarrows through the gangways. The docks had provisions for this by having a flat surface {{on one side and}} moorings directly under the pockets for schooners to receive the ore directly, while steamers moored {{on the opposite side of}} the dock. However, unloading was still a laborious hand-powered affair.|$|R
