5|$|Symbols {{of death}} {{appeared}} in his other work from this period. Soon after his stroke, the Russian royal family purchased a number <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> works, and the proceeds allowed him to travel to Teplitz—in today's Czech Republic—to recover.|$|E
5|$|Baker's {{work has}} {{achieved}} cult {{status in the}} years since his death, and two additional novels have been posthumously published. First-edition copies <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> works have become collector's items. His novel Testosterone was adapted to a film of the same name, though it was not a financial success. Two other books have been optioned for films, but they have not been produced.|$|E

50|$|Some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>early</b> {{students}} include Edson and Willie White, sons of James and Ellen G. White. Ellen White {{was a great}} supporter {{and influence}} to G. H. Bell.

5|$|In 1941 Amir {{published}} another {{collection of}} poems, entitled Buah Rindu ("Fruits of Longing"), which consisted mostly <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> works. Jassin {{notes that the}} works in Nyanyi Sunyi appear more developed and mature {{than those in the}} later collection. Teeuw notes that the later collection was more explicitly about romantic love, rather than the religious love of Nyanyi Sunyi.|$|E
5|$|In {{the book}} Okonkwo {{struggles with the}} legacy of his father– a shiftless debtor fond of playing the flute– {{as well as the}} {{complications}} and contradictions that arise when white missionaries arrive in his village of Umuofia. Exploring the terrain of cultural conflict, particularly the encounter between Igbo tradition and Christian doctrine, Achebe returns to the themes <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> stories, which grew from his own background.|$|E
5|$|In the book, Hemingway explores {{conflict}} {{within a}} marriage, {{the conflict between}} the European and native cultures in Africa, and the fear a writer feels when his work becomes impossible. The book includes descriptions <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> friendships with other writers and digressive ruminations on the nature of writing.|$|E
50|$|L.S.Lowry {{attended}} one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>earliest</b> exhibitions, buying three <b>of</b> <b>his</b> major <b>early</b> {{works to}} hang alongside <b>his</b> small collection <b>of</b> Pre-Raphaelites. Grimshaw became a regular visitor to Lowry’s home in Mottram.|$|R

5|$|The {{theme of}} suicide is also {{important}} in several <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> films. He shows how the desire to self-harm is often counteracted by humanity {{and the need to}} help others in the face of death. This illustrates the ongoing life force and the power of life over death.|$|E
5|$|When in 1952 Messiaen {{was asked}} to provide a test piece for flautists at the Paris Conservatoire, he {{composed}} the piece Le merle noir for flute and piano. While he had long been fascinated by birdsong, and birds had made appearances in several <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> works (for example La Nativité, Quatuor and Vingt regards), the flute piece was based entirely on {{the song of the}} blackbird.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had been}} {{painting}} for almost twenty years, Bacon steadfastly insisted that Three Studies was the fons et origo of his career. He destroyed many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> canvasses, and tried to suppress those that had left his studio. Bacon was emphatic that no pre-1944 images be admitted into his canon, {{and most of the}} early art critics agreed with this position. The early publications of John Russell and David Sylvester open with the 1944 triptych, and Bacon insisted to his death that no retrospective should feature paintings pre-dating 1944.|$|E

5|$|Born out {{of wedlock}} to a notary, Piero da Vinci, and a peasant woman, Caterina, in Vinci {{in the region of}} Florence, Leonardo was educated in the studio of the renowned Florentine painter Andrea del Verrocchio. Much <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> working life was spent in the service of Ludovico il Moro in Milan. He later worked in Rome, Bologna and Venice, and he spent his last years in France at the home awarded to him by Francis I of France.|$|E
5|$|Busoni gave many (but not all) of {{his works}} opus numbers; some numbers apply {{to more than one}} work (after the {{composer}} dropped some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> works from his acknowledged corpus). Nor are the composer's numbers all in temporal order. The musicologist Jürgen Kindermann has prepared a thematic catalogue {{of his works}} and transcriptions which is also used, {{in the form of the}} letters BV (for Busoni Verzeichnis, German:Busoni Index: sometimes the letters KiV for Kindermann Verzeichnis are used) followed by an identifier, to identify his compositions and transcriptions. The identifier B (for Bearbeitung, German: arrangement) is used for Busoni's transcriptions and cadenzas– e.g. BV B 1 refers to Busoni's cadenzas for Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4.|$|E
5|$|Critics who {{admire his}} middle work might {{characterize}} it as supple and muscular in its rhythms and sometimes harshly modernist, while others find these poems barren and weak in imaginative power. Yeats's later work found new imaginative inspiration in the mystical system {{he began to}} work out for himself {{under the influence of}} spiritualism. In many ways, this poetry is a return to the vision <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> work. The opposition between the worldly minded man of the sword and the spiritually minded man of God, the theme of The Wanderings of Oisin, is reproduced in A Dialogue Between Self and Soul.|$|E

5|$|Elgar's other {{compositions}} {{during the}} war included incidental music for a children's play, The Starlight Express (1915); a ballet, The Sanguine Fan (1917); and The Spirit of England (1915–17, to poems by Laurence Binyon), three choral settings very different in character from the romantic patriotism <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> years. His last large-scale composition of the war years was The Fringes of the Fleet, settings of verses by Rudyard Kipling, performed with great popular success around the country, until Kipling for unexplained reasons objected to their performance in theatres. Elgar conducted a recording of the work for the Gramophone Company.|$|E
5|$|For the exterior, Burges re-used some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> unexecuted plans, {{the overall}} design from the Crimea Memorial Church and St John's Cathedral, Brisbane, the {{elevations}} from Lille Cathedral. The main {{problem of the}} building was its size. Despite the prodigious efforts of its fundraisers, and despite Burges exceeding the original budget, Cork was still unable to afford a really large cathedral. Burges overcame this obstacle by using the grandeur of his three-spired exterior to offset the lesser scale of {{the remainder of the}} building.|$|E
5|$|In 1880 he {{designed}} an electric lighting project for Barcelona's Muralla de Mar, or seawall, {{which was not}} carried out. It consisted of eight large iron streetlamps, profusely decorated with plant motifs, friezes, shields and names of battles and Catalan admirals. The same year he participated in the competition {{for the construction of}} the San Sebastián social centre (now town hall), won by Luis Aladrén Mendivi and Adolfo Morales de los Ríos; Gaudí submitted a project that synthesised several <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> studies, such as the fountain for the Plaça Catalunya and the courtyard of the Provincial Council.|$|E

5|$|In 1889, Miloš's {{descendant}} King Alexander visited Jovanović at his Vienna {{studio and}} requested {{a painting of}} the revolt to commemorate its 75th anniversary. With his rise in stature, the artist had found himself producing numerous replicas <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> Orientalist works. According to biographer Nikola Kusovac, Jovanović grew bored with painting replicas and considered taking up a different genre. Alexander's request presented Jovanović {{with an opportunity to}} deviate from Orientalism and try his hand at history painting. The Takovo Uprising was his first historical composition.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Beebe {{traveled}} to Georgetown in pursuit <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> goal {{of establishing a}} permanent field research station in Guiana. After following several leads which came to nothing, his goal was realized when George Withers, who owned a rubber plantation on the Mazaruni River, offered him {{the use of a}} large house on his property for this purpose. Soon after Beebe and his researchers moved into the plantation house, which was known by the name of Kalacoon, they were paid a visit by Theodore Roosevelt and his family. Roosevelt subsequently wrote an article about the station for Scribner's Magazine, which helped to build public support for the station.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 Roa Bastos adapted Yo, el Supremo for the screen. His {{first novel}} since Yo, el Supremo, Vigilia del admirante (1992; Vigil of the Admiral) was {{published}} in 1992, and El fiscal (1993; The Prosecutor) the following year. Although neither of his later novels had the impact <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> work, El fiscal is considered an important work. Roa Bastos died on April 26, 2005 in Asunción from a heart attack. He was survived by his three children, his third wife, Iris Giménez, and {{a reputation as one}} of Latin American's finest writers.|$|E
