5|$|The {{killing of}} civilians living in Voćin and two nearby smaller villages began on 13 December at noon. The White Eagles infantry, {{supported}} {{by at least}} one tank, moved through Voćin bombing Croat-owned houses and killing civilians. The killings and the destruction took twelve hours and claimed the lives of 43 civilians. The bodies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> mutilated and left on display, presumably as a warning to others, outside Voćin itself, to flee or perish. All the victims were Croat civilians, except one 77-year-old Serb who had tried to protect his neighbours from the paramilitaries. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> elderly, including twelve women aged 56–76 and eleven men aged 60–84.|$|E
5|$|Dartmouth {{was not as}} densely {{populated}} as Halifax and was separated from the blast by {{the width of the}} harbour, but still suffered heavy damage. Almost 100 people were estimated to have died on the Dartmouth side. Windows were shattered and many buildings were damaged or destroyed, including the Oland Brewery and parts of the Starr Manufacturing Company. Nova Scotia Hospital was the only hospital in Dartmouth and many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> treated there.|$|E
5|$|Later {{the same}} year, it was {{revealed}} that large quantities of infant formula had been tainted with melamine, causing 300,000 infants to fall ill and resulting in several deaths. A group of parents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> reportedly detained for attempting to draw media attention to their plight. Dozens of lawyers—particularly from the provinces of Hebei, Henan and Shandong—offered pro-bono legal services to victims, but their efforts were obstructed by authorities.|$|E

5|$|The same day, several non-Serb {{civilians were}} killed in Dalj. In a {{subsequent}} round of negotiations with Croatian authorities, the SAO SBWS representatives reported 56 or 57 Croats were killed in Dalj on 1 August. Twenty-five bodies of the victims, including two civilians, were transferred to ZNG-held Osijek. Post-mortem examinations indicated some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> beaten and then executed.|$|E
5|$|A {{memorial}} {{ceremony was}} held for the victims on July 31, 1944, at Port Chicago. Admiral Carleton H. Wright, Commander, 12th Naval District, spoke of the unfortunate deaths {{and the need to}} keep the base operating during a time of war. He gave Navy and Marine Corps Medals for bravery to four officers and men who had successfully fought a fire in a rail car parked within a revetment near the pier. The remains of 44 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> interred at Golden Gate National Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|According to Ming Pao, {{family members}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> {{dissatisfied}} with the official investigation and held a sit-in protest, calling for a fair judgement. Some locals blamed the official rescue work by comparing it with a large emergency response exercise on a 330-meter building several days before, and the successful firefighting for a blaze at Shanghai World Financial Center in 2007. Others blamed an ineffective firefighting system for the high death toll, and were dissatisfied {{that they were not}} given more details about the fire.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{accounts}} {{of some of the}} guards, there may have been an opportunity for {{one or more of the}} guards to rescue a survivor. Yurovsky demanded that the guards come to his office and turn over items they had stolen following the assassinations. There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> left largely unattended in the truck, in the basement, and in the corridor of the house. Some guards who had not participated in the murders and had been sympathetic to the grand duchesses were left in the basement with the bodies.|$|E
5|$|After the Croatian Serb forces, the JNA and the paramilitaries {{established}} their {{control in the}} village, the Croat population was required to wear white armbands and mark their houses using white sheets. The church in Lovas was torched and 261 houses were looted and destroyed, while 1,341 civilians were forced to leave their homes. The bodies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> retrieved from a mass grave and ten individual graves in 1997. Lovas was rebuilt after the war, but its population size shrunk by one third compared to its pre-war level.|$|E
5|$|After the attack, {{the bulk}} of the {{civilian}} population and the remaining Croatian police and troops fled over snow-covered terrain in poor weather to Karlovac, Ogulin, and to the nearby territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Approximately 30–60 civilians, largely elderly people, remained in Saborsko. The JNA and SAO Krajina troops forced those who remained behind to leave the village, killing or abusing the civilians. At least 25 civilians were murdered by the troops {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the capture of Saborsko. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> shot, while others were beaten or burned to death.|$|E

5|$|Göth {{was also}} the officer {{in charge of the}} {{liquidation}} of Szebnie concentration camp, which interned 4,000 Jewish and 1,500 Polish slave labourers. Evidence presented at Göth's trial indicates he delegated this task to a subordinate, SS-Hauptscharführer Josef Grzimek, who was sent to assist camp commandant SS-Hauptsturmführer Hans Kellermann with mass killings. Between 21 September 1943 and 3February 1944 the camp was gradually liquidated. Around a thousand <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> taken to the nearby forest and shot, and the remainder were sent to Auschwitz, where most were gassed immediately on arrival.|$|E
5|$|In early 1943, the Nazis {{decided to}} {{increase}} greatly the gassing capacity of Birkenau. Crematorium II, {{which had been}} designed as a mortuary with morgues {{in the basement and}} ground-level incinerators, was converted into a killing factory by installing gas-tight doors, vents for the Zyklon B (a highly lethal cyanide-based pesticide) to be dropped into the chamber, and ventilation equipment to remove the gas thereafter. It went into operation in March. Crematorium III was built using the same design. Crematoria IV and V, designed from the start as gassing centers, were also constructed that spring. By June 1943, all four crematoria were operational. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> killed using these four structures.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> exhumed in 1998, {{after the}} area reverted to Croatian control {{following}} {{the signing of}} the Erdut Agreement in 1995. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) charged several Serbian and Croatian Serb officials, including Slobodan Milošević, Jovica Stanišić, Franko Simatović and Goran Hadžić, for their alleged involvement in the killings. Milošević and Hadžić died before their trials could be completed. Stanišić and Simatović were initially acquitted, but their acquittals were overturned on appeal, and they are being retried.|$|E

5|$|Some biographers' {{accounts}} {{speculated that}} the opportunity for {{one or more of}} the guards to rescue a survivor existed.

5|$|The Gospić {{massacre}} was {{the killing}} of 100–120 civilians in Gospić, Croatia {{during the last two}} weeks of October 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence. The majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> ethnic Serbs, arrested in Gospić and the nearby coastal town of Karlobag. Most of them were arrested on 16–17 October. Some of the detainees were taken to the Perušić barracks and executed in Lipova Glavica near the town, while others were shot in the Pazarište area of Gospić. The killings were ordered by the Secretary of Lika Crisis Headquarters, Tihomir Orešković, and the commander of the 118th Infantry Brigade of the Croatian National Guard, Lieutenant Colonel Mirko Norac.|$|E
5|$|The Ipswich serial murders {{took place}} between 30 October and 10 December 2006, during which time the bodies of five murdered women were {{discovered}} at different locations near Ipswich, Suffolk, England. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> women who had worked as prostitutes in the Ipswich area. Their bodies were discovered naked, {{but there were no}} signs of sexual assault. Two of the victims, Anneli Alderton and Paula Clennell, were confirmed to have been killed by asphyxiation. A cause of death for the other victims, Gemma Adams, Tania Nicol and Annette Nicholls, was not established.|$|E

5|$|The Moors murders {{were carried}} out by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley between July 1963 and October 1965, in and around Manchester, England. The victims were five {{children}} aged between 10 and 17—Pauline Reade, John Kilbride, Keith Bennett, Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans—at least four of whom were sexually assaulted. Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> discovered in graves dug on Saddleworth Moor; a third grave was discovered there in 1987, {{more than twenty years}} after Brady and Hindley's trial. The body of a fourth victim, Keith Bennett, is also suspected to be buried there, but despite repeated searches remains undiscovered.|$|E
5|$|The {{bodies of}} those killed at Krečane were left unburied for two weeks. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> not {{immediately}} killed, rather they took days to die and people living on the opposite bank of the Una River in Bosnia and Herzegovina claim that they heard cries for help for days after the killings took place. After two weeks, most of the bodies were bulldozed into a shallow grave {{on the bank of}} the river, and the rest thrown into the Una. The grave was located sufficiently close to the river to allow the current to wash at least some of the bodies away.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} {{involved the}} accidental triggering {{of a fire}} extinguishing system which sealed two forward compartments and released Halon 2402 (freon R-114B2), dibromotetrafluoroethane gas into them. According to survivors, those affected by the gas release were caught off guard and {{may not have been}} alerted in time due to warning sirens sounding only after the gas had already begun pouring in. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> reported to have been unable to turn on breathing kits before they suffocated.|$|E
