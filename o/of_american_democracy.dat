Analyzing the condition <b>of</b> the <b>American</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>of</b> the end of XX and the beginning of XXI centuries, C. West focused on the individual, existential character of the crisis. The diagnosed state had according to him much affect not only on political issues, but first and foremost on the spread <b>of</b> nihilism among <b>American</b> citizens.

25|$|The Linwoods; or Sixty Years Since in America (1835) is an {{historical}} romance set during the American Revolution. Sedgwick uses a cosmopolitan framework {{to shed light}} on American character and national identity in the early republic by exploring America's relationship with Britain and France. The balance between American nationalism and cosmopolitanism is idealized in the novel through the character of the Marquis de Lafayette, as is the struggle between Old World notions of class and the reality <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>democracy.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1997, when Irish {{documentary}} filmmaker Alan Gilsenan made God Bless America, {{consisting of}} six American cities {{seen through the}} eyes of six American authors, Hunt was invited to participate. Her participation resulted in Marsha Hunt's Philadelphia. According to Gilsenan, Hunt attributes the success <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>democracy</b> and capitalism to the crime of slavery, a crime that must be understood if America is to have peace. Hunt fell in love with Gilsenan and moved to the Wicklow mountains near Dublin with him, where in 1999 she helped him fight colon cancer, drawing on her own experiences with the disease. Hunt is no longer romantically involved with Gilsenan, who has since married and fathered a child, but as of 2008 still sees him.|$|E
25|$|Jefferson was {{a proponent}} of the Greek and Roman {{architectural}} styles, which he believed to be most representative <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>democracy</b> by historical association. These were popular during the federal period across the United States. Each academic unit is designed with a two-story temple front facing the quadrangle, while the library is modeled on the Roman Pantheon. The ensemble of buildings surrounding the quad is a statement {{of the importance of}} secular public education, while the exclusion of religious structures reinforces the principal of separation of church and state. The campus planning and architectural treatment is considered a paradigm of the ordering of man-made structures to express intellectual ideas and aspirations. A survey of members of the American Institute of Architects identified Jefferson's campus as the most significant work of architecture in America.|$|E

The results revealed a decrease in the participants 2 ̆ 7 political confidence and a decrease in the likelihood they would vote. Exposure to political information harmed most digital natives 2 ̆ 7 PIE and reinforced political attitudes in some.

25|$|William Seward {{contemplated}} {{this potential}} in the 1840s, when the Democrats were the nation's majority party, usually controlling Congress, the presidency, and many state offices. The country's institutional structure and party system allowed slaveholders to prevail in more of the nation's territories and to garner {{a great deal of}} influence over national policy. With growing popular discontent with the unwillingness of many Democratic leaders to take a stand against slavery, and growing consciousness of the party's increasingly pro-Southern stance, Seward became convinced that the only way for the Whig Party to counteract the Democrats' strong monopoly of the rhetoric of democracy and equality was for the Whigs to embrace anti-slavery as a party platform. Once again, to increasing numbers of Northerners, the Southern labor system was increasingly seen as contrary to the ideals <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>democracy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hartmann {{is also a}} vocal {{critic of}} the effects of {{neoliberal}} globalization on the U.S. economy, claiming that economic policies enacted during and since the presidency of Ronald Reagan have led, in large part, to many American industrial enterprises' being acquired by multinational firms based in overseas countries, leading in many cases to manufacturing jobs'—once considered a major foundation of the U.S. economy—being relocated to countries in Asia and other areas where the costs of labor are lower than in the U.S. and the concurrent reversal of the United States' traditional role of a leading exporter of finished manufactured goods to that of a primary importer of finished manufactured goods (exemplified by massive trade deficits with countries such as China). Hartmann argues that this phenomenon is leading to the erosion of the American middle class, whose survival Hartmann deems critical to the survival <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>democracy.</b> This argument is expressed in Hartmann's 2006 book, Screwed: The Undeclared War Against The Middle Class and What We Can Do About It. One of the book's main arguments is that media deregulation leads to corporate media's shifting the American consensus towards the acceptance of privatization and massive corporate profits—which causes the shrinking of the middle class.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{public support}} for {{democracy}} promotion is low. Public opinion polls since the 1990s consistently show that only about a quarter <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> support <b>democracy</b> promotion. Academic research further suggests that Americans are not persuaded to support international democracy promotion either to spread American values abroad or to promote US national interest.|$|R
5000|$|The Bush {{administration}} consistently opposed Chávez's policies, {{and although}} it did not immediately recognize the Carmona government upon its installation during the 2002 attempted coup, it had funded groups behind the coup, speedily acknowledged the new government and seemed to hope it would last. The U.S. government called Chávez a [...] "negative force" [...] in the region, and sought support from among Venezuela's neighbors to isolate Chávez diplomatically and economically. One notable instance occurred at the 2005 meeting of the Organization <b>of</b> <b>American</b> States, a U.S. resolution to add a mechanism to monitor the nature <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>democracies</b> was widely seen as an attempt at diplomatically isolating both Chávez and the Venezuelan government. The failure of the resolution was seen by analysts as politically significant, evidencing widespread support in Latin America for Chávez, his policies, and his views.|$|R
500|$|In a {{piece for}} the Berkeley Journal of Sociology, {{academic}} L. Alex Swan attributes the riot to a disparity between the promoted values <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>democracy</b> and the conditions of black citizens, in both the North and the South. Swan cites, for example, that the segregation {{of blacks in the}} armed forces continued while the United States fought for [...] "freedom." [...] Charles Lawrence of Fisk University described [...] "resentment of status given Negro members of the armed forces" [...] as [...] "perhaps the greatest single psychological factor in the making of the Harlem riot", as Bandy came to represent black soldiers and Collins came to represent white suppression.|$|E
500|$|The {{underlying}} causes of the riot stemmed from resentment among black residents of Harlem of the disparity between the vaunted values <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>democracy</b> and {{the social and economic}} conditions they were forced to live under, including brutality and discriminatory treatment by the mostly white city police force. They resented the segregation of black troops serving with the United States, and wartime shortages created more difficult conditions in Harlem housing and supplies. African Americans suffered discriminatory practices in civil and private employment, and city services, which created tension as they tried to improve their lives. Bandy symbolized the Black soldiers who were segregated in the Army, even as the United States promoted the national fight for 'freedom.' Collins represented the white discrimination and suppression black residents had to deal with on a daily basis. The riot became a subject of art and literature: it was depicted in the [...] "theatrical climax" [...] of Ralph Ellison's novel Invisible Man, winner of the 1953 National Book Award, and in artist William Johnson's painting Moon Over Harlem.|$|E
500|$|By September 1948, the Red Scare {{began to}} take hold, and Conant called for a ban on hiring {{teachers}} who were communists, although not for the dismissal {{of those who had}} already been hired. A debate ensued over whether communist educators could teach apolitical subjects. Conant {{was a member of the}} Educational Policies Commission (EPC), a body to which he had been appointed in 1941. When it next met in March 1949, Conant's push for a ban was supported by the president of Columbia University, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower. The two found common ground in their belief in ideology-based education, which Conant called [...] "democratic education". He did not see public education as a side effect <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>democracy,</b> but as one of its principal driving forces, and he disapproved of the public funding of denominational schools that he observed in Australia during his visit there in 1951. He called for increased federal spending on education, and higher taxes to redistribute wealth. His thinking was outlined in his books Education in a Divided World in 1948, and Education and Liberty in 1951. In 1952, he went further and endorsed the dismissal of academics who invoked the Fifth under questioning by the House Un-American Activities Committee.|$|E

25|$|After the {{terrorist}} attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. government officials questioned the lack <b>of</b> large-scale <b>American</b> <b>democracy</b> promotion mechanisms in the MENA region, viewing democracy as a means of promoting moderation and stability and preventing terrorism. This resulted in a ramping-up of diplomatic rhetoric on the necessity of democratization and political reform in the Middle East and an increase in funding for democracy promotion in the region. Spreading democracy was also one rationalization used by neo-conservatives and the Bush administration for undertaking the War in Iraq.|$|R
500|$|The {{expedition}} sighted Cape Cod on November 9, 1620, {{and landed}} {{at what is}} now Provincetown, Massachusetts. Two days later, the men signed the Mayflower Compact, wherein all agreed to submit themselves {{to the will of}} the majority—one of the foundation documents <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>democracy.</b> They established a settlement at Plymouth Colony (today Plymouth, Massachusetts), but they had expected to land further south and were ill-equipped for a Massachusetts winter. Half died before spring came. There had been few Native Americans in the area, but in 1621, the settlers were approached by a group, including two, Samoset and Squanto, who spoke some English. Squanto taught the Pilgrims indigenous methods for cultivating corn (maize), a plant native to the New World with which the emigrants were unfamiliar. This knowledge helped the Pilgrims gradually become established. The Pilgrims grew in population relatively slowly over the first generations in America, and became a minority among settlers in the area. [...] In 1691, Plymouth Colony became part of the Province of Massachusetts Bay. Bradford's wife had died while the ship was in Provincetown Harbor; after Governor John Carver perished during the first winter, Bradford was elected in his place, and served fifteen two-year terms. He guided the colony from the communal economy necessary at first, to privatization, greatly increasing the harvest in the process. His diaries were published as Of Plymouth Plantation and constitute the major source of information concerning the Pilgrims' daily lives.|$|E
