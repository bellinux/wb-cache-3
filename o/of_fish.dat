Upstream of the Lofty Reservoir, {{there are two}} species <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> inhabiting the stream: brook trout, eastern blacknose dace. The 1990 survey observed these two species as well as white suckers and pumpkinseeds. Three species <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> inhabit the stream between the Lofty Reservoir and the Blue Head Reservoir. These species are brook trout, brown trout, and blacknose dace. Six species <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> inhabit the stream below the Blue Head Reservoir: brook trout, blacknose dace, tessellated darters, brown trout, white suckers, and sculpins. However, only the first three species were observed during the 1990 survey of the stream.|$|E

40|$|We {{correlated}} maximum lengths <b>of</b> freshwater <b>fishes</b> captured during 10 {{years with}} standard gears (i. e., gill nets, boat electrofishers and trap nets) and angling from Nebraska water bodies {{to determine which}} methodology provided better estimates of maximum size <b>of</b> <b>fishes</b> produced within a given water body.

Although significant (based on sequential Bonferroni adjustment) correlation was found in only one <b>of</b> nine sport <b>fishes</b> assessed, all correlations were positive indicating a general trend between maximum size <b>of</b> <b>fishes</b> captured with these two methodologies.

5|$|In 1996, Japan ranked {{fourth in}} the world in tonnage <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> caught. Japan {{captured}} 4,074,580 metric tons <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> in 2005, down from 4,987,703 tons in 2000, 9,558,615 tons in 1990, 9,864,422 tons in 1980, 8,520,397 tons in 1970, 5,583,796 tons in 1960 and 2,881,855 tons in 1950. In 2003, the total aquaculture production was predicted at 1,301,437 tonnes. In 2010, Japan's total fisheries production was 4,762,469 fish. Offshore fisheries accounted for an average of 50% of the nation's total fish catches in the late 1980s although they experienced repeated ups and downs during that period.|$|E

40|$|Biodiverse {{coastal zones}} are often areas <b>of</b> intense <b>fishing</b> {{pressure}} {{due to the}} high relative density <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> capacity in these nearshore regions. Although overcapacity {{is one of the}} central challenges to fisheries sustainability in coastal zones, accurate estimates <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> pressure in coastal zones are limited, hampering the assessment of the direct and collateral impacts (e. g., habitat degradation, bycatch) <b>of</b> <b>fishing.</b> We compiled a comprehensive database <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> effort metrics and the corresponding spatial limits of fisheries and used a spatial analysis program (FEET) to map fishing effort density (measured as boat-meters per km 2) in the coastal zones of six ocean regions. We also considered the utility of a number of socioeconomic variables as indicators <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> pressure at the national level; fishing density increased as a function of population size and decreased as a function of coastline length. Our mapping exercise points to intra and interregional ‘hotspots’ <b>of</b> coastal <b>fishing</b> pressure. The significant and intuitive relationships we found between fishing density and population size and coastline length may help with coarse regional characterizations <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> pressure. However, spatially-delimited fishing effort data are needed to accurately map fishing hotspots, i. e., areas <b>of</b> intense <b>fishing</b> activity. We suggest that estimates <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> effort, not just target catch or yield, serve as a necessary measure <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> activity, which is a key link to evaluating sustainability and environmental impacts of coastal fisheries...|$|R

5|$|A random {{assemblage}} <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> merely {{using some}} localised resource {{such as food}} or nesting sites is known simply as an aggregation. When fish come together in an interactive, social grouping, then they may be forming either a shoal or a school depending {{on the degree of}} organisation. A shoal is a loosely organised group where each fish swims and forages independently but is attracted to other members of the group and adjusts its behaviour, such as swimming speed, so that it remains close to {{the other members of the}} group. Schools <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> are much more tightly organised, synchronising their swimming so that all fish move at the same speed and in the same direction. Shoaling and schooling behaviour is believed to provide a variety of advantages.|$|E
