50|$|Oropouche fever is a {{tropical}} viral infection, a zoonosis similar to dengue fever, transmitted by biting midge (species Culicoides paraensis) and mosquitoes {{from the blood}} of sloths to humans. It occurs mainly in the Amazonic region, the Caribbean and Panama. The disease is named after the region where it was first described and isolated at the Trinidad Regional Virus Laboratory, in 1955, the Oropouche River in Trinidad and Tobago and {{is caused by a}} specific arbovirus, the <b>Oropouche</b> <b>virus</b> (OROV), of the Bunyaviridae family.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Oropouche</b> <b>virus</b> (OROV) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common orthobunyaviruses. When OROV infects humans, it causes a rapid fever illness called Oropouche fever. OROV was {{originally}} reported in Trinidad and Tobago in 1955 from the blood sample of a fever patient and from a pool of Coquillettidia venezuelensis mosquitoes. In 1960, OROV was isolated from a sloth (Bradypus tridactylus) and a pool of Ochlerotatus (Ochlerotatus) serratus mosquitoes in Brazil. The virus is considered a public health threat in tropical and subtropical areas of Central and South America, with over half million infected people as of 2005. OROV is considered to be an arbovirus due to the method of transmission by the mosquitoes Aedes serratus and Culex quinquefasciatus among sloths, marsupials, primates, and birds.|$|E
40|$|Schmallenberg virus, a novel orthobunyavirus, is {{spreading}} among ruminants, especially sheep, throughout Europe. To determine {{the risk for}} human infection, we conducted a survey among shepherds to assess possible exposure and symptoms. We also performed serologic and molecular assays. No evidence of transmission to humans was detected. In November 2011, a new virus of the genus Orthobunyavirus was isolated from diseased cattle in Germany and was provisionally called Schmallenberg virus (SBV) (1). It has caused disease in ruminants, i. e., sheep, cattle, and goats. Acute clinical signs such as fever and diarrhea; severe congenital malformation, such as arthrogryposis and hydroencephaly; and {{a high proportion of}} stillbirths have been reported among infected animals (2). Transplacental transmission leads to fetal infection. The virus is vector borne and has been isolated from biting midges (Culicoides spp.) (3 – 5). Genomic analyses showed a close phylogenetic relationship to epizootic viruses of the Simbu serogroup, for which zoonotic transmission has not been shown (1). However, SBV also bears new genetic and animal-related clinical and epidemiologic properties. Iquitos and <b>Oropouche</b> <b>viruses</b> of this serogroup are also transmitted by culicoids and cause outbreaks in humans (6).

Antigenic {{relationships}} among 24 bunyaviruses of the Simbu serogroup {{were determined by}} complement-fixation (CF), serum dilution-plaque reduction neutralization (N) and, where possible, hemagglutinaton-inhibition (HI) tests. By CF, three distinct complexes of closely related viruses were identified within the serogroup. Nola and Thimiri viruses, which showed little relationship {{with other members of}} the serogroup, may represent two additional complexes. N tests in Vero cells showed that individual viruses generally were distinguishable with little difficulty. Aino and Kaikalur viruses were indistinguishable by CF or N. Seven viruses showed hemagglutnaton activity, and antigenic {{relationships among}} these viruses by HI paralleled those established by N tests. A classification scheme, based on both CF and N test results, for the viruses of the Simbu serogroup is proposed. Of the approximately 140 arboviruses compris ing the family Bunyaviridae, 89 belong in the Bun yavirus @ 2 One of the two largest sero groups within this genus is the Simbu serogroup.

40|$|<b>Oropouche</b> (ORO) <b>virus,</b> {{a member}} of the Simbu serogroup, {{is one of the few}} human {{pathogens}} in the Orthobunyavirus genus in the family Bunyaviridae. Genetic analyses of ORO-like strains from Iquitos, Peru, identified a novel reassortant containing the S and L segments of ORO virus and the M segment of a novel Simbu serogroup virus. This new pathogen, which we named Iquitos (IQT) virus, was first isolated during 1999 from a febrile patient in Iquitos, an Amazonian city in Peru. Subsequently, the virus was identified as the cause of outbreaks of "Oropouche fever" during 2005 and 2006 in Iquitos. In addition to the identification of 17 isolates of IQT virus between 1999 and 2006, surveys for neutralizing antibody among Iquitos residents revealed prevalence rates of 14. 9 % for ORO virus and 15. 4 % for IQT virus. Limited studies indicate that prior infection with ORO virus does not seem to protect against disease caused with the IQT virus infection.

Diagnosis of ORO virus infection is based mainly on serology.

40|$|<b>Oropouche</b> <b>virus</b> (OROV) is a midge-borne human {{pathogen}} with a geographic distribution in South America. OROV was first isolated in 1955, and since then, {{it has been}} known to cause recurring outbreaks of a dengue-like illness in the Amazonian regions of Brazil. OROV, however, {{remains one of the most}} poorly understood emerging viral zoonoses. Here we describe the successful recovery of infectious OROV entirely from cDNA copies of its genome and generation of OROV mutant viruses lacking either the NSm or the NSs coding region. Characterization of the recombinant viruses carried out in vitro demonstrated that the NSs protein of OROV is an interferon (IFN) antagonist as in other NSs-encoding bunyaviruses. Additionally, we demonstrate the importance of the nine C-terminal amino acids of OROV NSs in IFN antagonistic activity. OROV was also found to be sensitive to IFN-α when cells were pretreated; however, the virus was still capable of replicating at doses as high as 10, 000 U/ml of IFN-α, in contrast to the family prototype BUNV. We found that OROV lacking the NSm protein displayed characteristics similar to those of the wild-type virus, suggesting that the NSm protein is dispensable for virus replication in the mammalian and mosquito cell lines that were tested.

OROV was first isolated in 1955, and since then, {{it has been}} known to cause recurring outbreaks of a dengue-like illness in the Amazonian regions of Brazil. OROV, however, {{remains one of the most}} poorly understood emerging viral zoonoses. Here we describe the successful recovery of infectious OROV entirely from cDNA copies of its genome and generation of OROV mutant viruses lacking either the NSm or the NSs coding region. Characterization of the recombinant viruses carried out in vitro demonstrated that the NSs protein of OROV is an interferon (IFN) antagonist as in other NSs-encoding bunyaviruses. Additionally, we demonstrate the importance of the nine C-terminal amino acids of OROV NSs in IFN antagonistic activity. OROV was also found to be sensitive to IFN-α when cells were pretreated; however, the virus was still capable of replicating at doses as high as 10, 000 U/ml of IFN-α, in contrast to the family prototype BUNV. We found that OROV lacking the NSm protein displayed characteristics similar to those of the wild-type virus, suggesting that the NSm protein is dispensable for virus replication in the mammalian and mosquito cell lines that were tested. IMPORTANCE <b>Oropouche</b> <b>virus</b> (OROV) is a public health threat in Central and South America, where it causes periodic outbreaks of dengue-like illness. In Brazil, OROV is the second most frequent cause of arboviral febrile illness after dengue virus, and with the current rates of urban expansion, more cases of this emerging viral zoonosis could occur. To better understand the molecular biology of OROV, we have successfully rescued the virus along with mutants. We have established that the C terminus of the NSs protein is important in interferon antagonism and that the NSm protein is dispensable for virus replication in cell culture. The tools described in this paper are important in terms of understanding this important yet neglected human pathogen. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|E
