5|$|Clock {{towers in}} Western Europe in the Middle Ages were also {{sometimes}} striking clocks. The most famous original still standing is possibly St Mark's Clock {{on the top}} of St Mark's Clocktower in St Mark's Square in Venice, assembled in 1493 by the clockmaker Gian Carlo Rainieri from Reggio Emilia. In 1497, Simone Campanato moulded the great bell on which every definite time-lapse is beaten by two mechanical bronze statues (h. 2,60 m.) called Due Mori (Two Moors), handling a hammer. Possibly earlier (1490) is the Prague Astronomical Clock by clockmaster Jan Růže (also called Hanuš) – according to another source this device was assembled as early as 1410 by clockmaker Mikuláš of Kadaň and mathematician Jan Šindel.

5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Bostwick scored in Stevenage's 2–1 {{pre-season}} victory at Dagenham & Redbridge on 30 July 2011. A week later, he started in Stevenage's first ever League One fixture, a 0–0 draw against Exeter City. Three days after the draw, on 9 August, Bostwick scored his first goal of the campaign in a 4–3 extra-time defeat to Championship team Peterborough United, scoring with a 25-yard shot that took the match to extra-time. In Stevenage's next league fixture, a 1–1 draw away at Chesterfield, he was sent-off after receiving two yellow cards, resulting in a one-match suspension. Bostwick signed a two-year contract extension with the club on 26 August 2011. He scored his second goal of the 2011–12 season in Stevenage's 5–1 home win over Sheffield Wednesday, with his 25-yard half-volley rebounding off of the post and into the net to give Stevenage a three-goal lead in the first-half. Bostwick was also instrumental in the club's 6–1 away victory at Colchester United on 26 December, scoring one goal and assisting another. His goal restored Stevenage's two-goal cushion in the match <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> mark, before he assisted Scott Laird from a well-worked free-kick routine ten minutes later. He beat his goal tally from the previous season when he scored his fourth goal of the campaign in Stevenage's 4–2 victory against Milton Keynes Dons at Broadhall Way on 24 January 2012, with Bostwick restoring parity in the first-half with a long-range strike. Bostwick also scored in a 2–2 draw against Huddersfield Town on 28 February 2012, heading in Joel Byrom's cross to half the deficit as Stevenage fought back to earn a point after being two goals down. He scored two goals in as many matches in late March 2012, both of which were long-range strikes that drew Stevenage level in matches against Walsall and Bournemouth respectively. Four days after the goal against Bournemouth, Bostwick was on the scoresheet once again, his third goal within the space of a week, scoring late-on to give Stevenage a brief lead in an eventual draw against Wycombe Wanderers. He was almost ever-present during the campaign, playing 53 times and scoring eight goals, as Stevenage narrowly lost over two legs in the play-off semi-final. During his successful four seasons with the club, Bostwick made 207 appearances, scoring 22 goals.|$|E
