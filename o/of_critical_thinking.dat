Although rooted in Islam, pioneers of Islamic feminism have also used secular and western feminist discourses and have sought to include Islamic feminism in the larger global feminist movement. Islamic feminists seek to highlight the teachings of equality in Islam to question patriarchal interpretations of Islamic teachings. Others point out the incredible amount of flexibility of shariah law, which can offer greater protections for women if the political will to do so is present.|$|E
40|$|Human patient {{simulation}} (HPS) {{is becoming}} a popular teaching method in nursing education globally and is believed to enhance both knowledge and <b>critical</b> <b>thinking.</b> Objective: While {{there is evidence that}} HPS improves knowledge, there is no objective nursing data to support HPS impact on <b>critical</b> <b>thinking.</b> Therefore, we studied knowledge and <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> before and after HPS in prelicensure nursing students and attempted to identify the predictors <b>of</b> higher <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> scores. Methods: Using a one-group, quasi-experimental, pre-test post-test design, 154 prelicensure nursing students (age 25. 7. ±. 6. 7; gender. = 87. 7 % female) from 3 schools were studied at the same point in their curriculum using a high-fidelity simulation. Pre- and post-HPS assessments <b>of</b> knowledge, <b>critical</b> <b>thinking,</b> and self-efficacy were done as well as assessments for demographics and learning style. Results: There was a mean improvement in knowledge scores of 6. 5 points (P. <. 0. 001), showing evidence of learning. However, there was no statistically significant change in the <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> scores. A logistic regression with 10 covariates revealed three variables to be predictors <b>of</b> higher <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> scores: greater "age" (P. = 0. 01), baseline "knowledge" (P. = 0. 04) and a low self-efficacy score ("not at all confident") in "baseline self-efficacy in managing a patient's fluid levels" (P. =. 05). Conclusion: This study reveals that gains in knowledge with HPS do not equate to changes in <b>critical</b> <b>thinking.</b> It does expose the variables of older age, higher baseline knowledge and low self-efficacy in "managing a patient's fluid levels" as being predictive <b>of</b> higher <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> ability. Further study is warranted to determine the effect of repeated or sequential simulations (dosing) and timing after the HPS experience on <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> gains. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|The present {{case study}} mainly {{focused on the}} effects of a teacher’s {{questions}} on the development <b>of</b> students’ <b>critical</b> <b>thinking.</b> The purpose was to investigate whether teacher’s questions could facilitate students’ <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> which required students to manipulate knowledge instead of direct recalling. Classroom observation and interview were employed in the study. A teacher’s questioning behavior was observed and 17 students were interviewed. The results showed the teacher asked more lower-cognitive questions (79. 2 %) than higher ones (20. 8 %). Based on the theory of the cognitive domain, results revealed that excessive use of lower-cognitive questions could not facilitate the development <b>of</b> students’ <b>critical</b> <b>thinking.</b> Additionally, the misuse of higher-cognitive questions by the teacher was also identified...|$|R
25|$|In 1908, {{at the age}} of 25, Neill {{enrolled}} in the University of Edinburgh. He began as an agriculture student, at his father's behest for a well-salaried career, but switched to English literature {{by the end of his}} first year. Neill was excluded from cultural events due to his lack of funds, but participated in sports, showed interest in the military, and wrote for The Student (the university magazine) and the Glasgow Herald. He became the student paper's editor during his last year, which opened Neill to a world of culture. He also felt more confident to pursue women. In his editorials, Neill criticized the tedium of lectures and the emphasis on tests instead <b>of</b> <b>critical</b> <b>thinking.</b> He began to develop his thoughts about the futility of forced education, and the axiom that all learning came from intrinsic interest. Neill graduated in 1912 and began to edit encyclopedias and similar reference books. He took a new job as art editor of the Piccadilly Magazine, but its operations were halted by the 1914 onset of World War I, in which he served as an officer in the army. He returned to Scotland, working as a headteacher at Gretna Green School, during the first year of the war. The diary he wrote for this year was published as a book, A Dominie's Log, in November 1915 by Herbert Jenkins, and received good reviews for its humour and narrative style.|$|E

500|$|Townsend's {{experiences}} in China {{formed the basis}} of his first book Ways That Are Dark: The Truth About China, the release of which on 10 November 1933 put Townsend in the spotlight both nationally and internationally. Billed as doing [...] "for China what Katherine Mayo did for Mother India", Townsend's book included a controversial critique of Chinese society and culture. At a time when China was in the grip civil strife, Townsend believed that the source of its problems lay in fundamental defects in the ethics of its people, including above all their propensity for dishonesty, lack of fixed loyalties outside of their family group, and inability to cooperate effectively with one another, as well as their greed, physical cowardice, and lack <b>of</b> <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> skills. He concludes that the [...] "outstanding characteristics" [...] of the Chinese people [...] "neither enable other peoples to deal satisfactorily with them, nor enable the Chinese to deal satisfactorily with themselves" [...] and predicts no end to chaotic conditions within the country. He also favorably contrasts what he considers Japan's sensible policies toward China with the naively [...] "sentimentalist" [...] ones adopted by the United States.|$|E
500|$|Townsend had {{asserted}} {{in chapter}} {{one that the}} cause of China's present misery lies in the fundamental defects that exist in the ethnic characteristics of the Chinese people and in chapters three and four he explains what he believes these defects are. Townsend states that dishonesty is [...] "the most prominent characteristic in the Chinese mentality as opposed to our own". Townsend gives many examples of him being lied to by Chinese employees, coolies, shopkeepers, and government officials, and notes that many other consuls were driven out of the service by this relentless and [...] "aimless lying, with each lie merely a pretext for another". The other highly salient trait of the Chinese is their [...] "indifference to fellow suffering". Through a large number of personal and second-hand anecdotes, Townsend argues that the Chinese may be the only {{people in the world who}} are completely unable to comprehend the basic human impulses of sympathy or gratitude toward other people. Because the Chinese feel no empathy toward others, they behave in an unbelievably sadistic and cruel fashion toward one another, and they view altruistic foreigners as targets to be mercilessly taken advantage of. Other traits Townsend identifies as being typically Chinese are cowardice, [...] lust for money, lack of a sense of personal hygiene, lack <b>of</b> <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> skills, insincerity, and obsession with hollow rites. Townsend believes that these traits are as notable among China's leaders and educated strata as much as they are in the poor masses, and his analysis of historical documents leads him to believe that they are not a recent product of the present chaos, but rather are deeply ingrained traits of China's national character. He concludes that the [...] "outstanding characteristics" [...] of the Chinese people [...] "neither enable other peoples to deal satisfactorily with them, nor enable the Chinese to deal satisfactorily with themselves." ...|$|E
