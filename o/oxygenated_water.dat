5|$|Caddisfly {{cases are}} open at both ends, the larvae drawing <b>oxygenated</b> <b>water</b> through the {{posterior}} end, over their gills, and pumping {{it out of}} the wider, anterior end. The larvae move around inside the tubes and this helps maintain the water current; the lower the oxygen content of the water, the more active the larvae need to be. This mechanism enable caddisfly larvae to live in waters too low in oxygen content to support stonefly and mayfly larvae.|$|E
5|$|During the day, zebra {{sharks are}} {{sluggish}} and usually found {{resting on the}} sea bottom, sometimes using their pectoral fins {{to prop up the}} front part of their bodies and facing into the current with their mouths open to facilitate respiration. Reef channels are favored resting spots, since the tightened space yields faster, more <b>oxygenated</b> <b>water.</b> They become more active at night or when food becomes available. Zebra sharks are strong and agile swimmers, propelling themselves with pronounced anguilliform (eel-like) undulations of the body and tail. In a steady current, they have been seen hovering in place with sinuous waves of their tails.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{lead for}} water pipes is {{problematic}} {{in areas with}} soft or acidic water. Hard water forms insoluble layers in the pipes whereas soft and acidic water dissolves the lead pipes. Dissolved {{carbon dioxide in the}} carried water may result in the formation of soluble lead bicarbonate; <b>oxygenated</b> <b>water</b> may similarly dissolve lead as lead(II) hydroxide. Drinking such water, over time, can cause health problems due to the toxicity of the dissolved lead. The harder the water the more calcium bicarbonate and sulfate it will contain, and the more the inside of the pipes will be coated with a protective layer of lead carbonate or lead sulfate.|$|E
50|$|The Brown Dense {{accumulated}} on {{the bottom}} of a prehistoric stratified Gulf of Mexico. The upper part of the water column was well-oxygenated and subject to frequent algal blooms. Underlying these <b>oxygenated</b> <b>waters</b> and separated by a pycnocline, were anoxic and hypersaline bottom waters, which preserved organic matter as it accumulated. The organic matter consisted of algal material that fell downward from the overlying <b>oxygenated</b> <b>waters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Elimia snails are gill-breathing snails that {{typically}} inhabit highly <b>oxygenated</b> <b>waters</b> on rock shoals and gravel bars.|$|R
50|$|Photosynthetic {{plants and}} algae are {{important}} for <b>oxygenating</b> <b>water,</b> providing a medium for biofilms, sequestering heavy metals and many other services.|$|R
5|$|A {{blood vessel}} leads {{up the middle}} of the body from the stomach to a {{circular}} vessel {{at the base of the}} lophophore, and from there a single blind vessel runs up each tentacle. A pair of blood vessels near the body wall lead downward from the lophophore ring to the stomach and also to blind branches throughout the body. There is no heart, but the major vessels can contract in waves to move the blood. Phoronids do not ventilate their trunks with <b>oxygenated</b> <b>water,</b> but rely on respiration through the lophophore. The blood contains hemoglobin, which is unusual in such small animals and seems to be an adaptation to anoxic and hypoxic environments. The blood of Phoronis architecta carries twice as much oxygen as a human of the same weight. Two metanephridia filter the body fluid, returning any useful products and dumping the remaining soluble wastes through a pair of pores beside the anus.|$|E
5|$|Diving beetles, {{such as the}} Dytiscidae, carry {{a bubble}} of air {{with them when they}} dive. Such a bubble may be {{contained}} under the elytra or against the body by specialized hydrophobic hairs. The bubble covers {{at least some of the}} spiracles, permitting air to enter the tracheae. The function of the bubble is not only to contain a store of air, but to act as a physical gill. The air that it traps is in contact with <b>oxygenated</b> <b>water,</b> so as the animal's consumption depletes the oxygen in the bubble, more oxygen can diffuse in to replenish it. Carbon dioxide is more soluble in water than either oxygen or nitrogen, so it readily diffuses out faster than in. Nitrogen is the most plentiful gas in the bubble, and the least soluble, so it constitutes a relatively static component of the bubble and acts as a stable medium for respiratory gases to accumulate in and pass through. Occasional visits to the surface are sufficient for the beetle to re-establish the constitution of the bubble.|$|E
5|$|Mantas {{move through}} the water by the wing-like {{movements}} of their pectoral fins, which drive water backwards. Their large mouths are rectangular, and face forward as opposed to other ray and skate species with downward-facing mouths. The spiracles typical of rays are vestigial, and mantas must swim continuously to keep <b>oxygenated</b> <b>water</b> passing over their gills. The cephalic fins are usually spiralled, but flatten during foraging. The fish's gill arches have pallets of pinkish-brown spongy tissue that collect food particles. Mantas track down prey using visual and olfactory senses. They {{have one of the}} highest brain-to-body mass ratios and the largest brain size of all fish. Their brains have retia mirabilia which may serve to keep them warm. M. alfredi has been shown to dive to depths of over 400 m, while their relative Mobula tarapacana, which has a similar structure, dives to nearly 2000 m; the retia mirabilia probably serve to prevent their brains from being chilled during such dives into colder subsurface waters.|$|E
50|$|They have {{retreated from}} many {{estuaries}} worldwide due to excess water pollution although in some estuaries {{that have been}} cleaned up, herring have returned. The presence of their larvae indicates cleaner and more - <b>oxygenated</b> <b>waters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Species of this genus are {{commonly}} found in small to medium headwater streams with clear, fast running, and well-oxygenated water, where the bottom is composed of rocks, boulders, and sometimes gravel. They are not tolerant to polluted or not <b>oxygenated</b> <b>waters.</b>|$|R
50|$|I. steinbachi is a rheophilic {{species that}} lives in fast flowing and very <b>oxygenated</b> <b>waters.</b> Its color pattern {{reflects}} mimicry with stoned bottoms. Fertilized eggs have been found on the hidden surface of a stone, suggesting that I. steinbachi could be a cavity spawner.|$|R
25|$|Despite being {{air-breathing}} molluscs, {{they can}} survive {{for up to}} 32 hours in cold, highly <b>oxygenated</b> <b>water,</b> which may have helped to disperse its population around the Colorado Valley area since a controlled release was conducted in 1998.|$|E
25|$|After {{researching the}} oral {{histories}} and journalistic records of past jubilees, measuring physical and meteorologic conditions, and taking {{biological and chemical}} measurements, Loesch concluded that accumulated organic material on the bay floor could, under a certain set of conditions, result in a rapid depletion of oxygen (hypoxia) {{in parts of the}} bay, driving fish to the surface seeking <b>oxygenated</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
25|$|On the seabed, wrecks {{are slowly}} broken {{up by the}} forces of wave action caused by the weather and {{currents}} caused by tides. Also more highly <b>oxygenated</b> <b>water,</b> which promotes corrosion, reduces the strength of ferrous structural materials of the ship. Deeper wrecks are likely to be protected by less exposure to water movement and by lower levels of oxygen in water.|$|E
50|$|For most of {{the year}} the deep waters are anoxic, and {{hydrogen}} sulphide (H2S) is often detected near the bottom. In the late summer and early fall, <b>oxygenated</b> <b>waters</b> from the Haro Strait and the Satellite Channel spill over into the deep basin of Saanich Inlet.|$|R
50|$|Habitat: Common in fast-flowing, well <b>oxygenated</b> fresh <b>water</b> and well-drained vegetated ponds. Present in Scotland.|$|R
50|$|The western {{coast of}} the island is washed with waters from the river Guaz√∫ in {{addition}} to those of the Uruguay River from the north, while the east receives the cleaner and more <b>oxygenated</b> <b>waters</b> of the Camacho River; in this area a type of fish called a pejerrey (Odontesthes bonariensis) can be found in abundance. As a result, it is a habitual destination for fishing boats.|$|R
25|$|Outside {{of a few}} basal {{animals that}} have no brain or a very simple one, no animals {{have been found to}} date that satisfy any of these criteria. While some {{varieties}} of shark, such as great whites and hammerheads, must remain in motion at all times to move <b>oxygenated</b> <b>water</b> over their gills, it is possible they still sleep one cerebral hemisphere at a time as marine mammals do. However it remains to be shown definitively whether any fish is capable of unihemispheric sleep.|$|E
25|$|Corydoras panda follows, {{with a few}} minor deviations, the {{standard}} model for breeding for the genus. Stimulus for breeding consists of the influx of cooler, oxygenated waters into their habitat, usually corresponding in the wild {{with the onset of}} the rainy season. However, while some Corydoras species require a temperature drop in the aquarium for spawning to be stimulated, in the case of Corydoras panda, the temperature drop appears to matter much less, as specimens have spawned in the aquarium without a temperature drop. The addition of new, clean, <b>oxygenated</b> <b>water</b> appears to be the primary stimulus for this species. In the wild, the appearance of new water courtesy of the rains is followed by an increase in the populations of assorted food organisms, and feeding upon these conditions the fishes for breeding.|$|E
25|$|As a result, {{microbial}} mats {{began to}} produce the atmosphere we know today, in which free oxygen is a vital component. At {{around the same time}} they may also have been the birthplace of the more complex eukaryote type of cell, of which all multicellular organisms are composed. Microbial mats were abundant on the shallow seabed until the Cambrian substrate revolution, when animals living in shallow seas increased their burrowing capabilities and thus broke up the surfaces of mats and let <b>oxygenated</b> <b>water</b> into the deeper layers, poisoning the oxygen-intolerant microorganisms that lived there. Although this revolution drove mats off soft floors of shallow seas, they still flourish in many environments where burrowing is limited or impossible, including rocky seabeds and shores, hyper-saline and brackish lagoons, and are found on the floors of the deep oceans.|$|E

50|$|An {{asteroid}} (estimated at 10 km across) {{slammed into}} waters about 1,000 m deep some 1.85 billion years ago. Computer models {{suggest that the}} tsunami {{would have been at}} least 1,000 m at the centre, and 100 m high about 3,000 km away. Those immense waves and large underwater landslides triggered by the impact stirred the ocean, bringing <b>oxygenated</b> <b>waters</b> from the surface down to the ocean floor.|$|R
25|$|Originally a land-locked {{fresh water}} lake, the Black Sea {{was flooded with}} salt water from the Mediterranean Sea during the Holocene. The influx of salt water {{essentially}} smothered the fresh water below it because a lack of internal motion and mixing meant that no fresh oxygen reached the deep waters, creating a meromictic body of water. The anoxic environment, which is hostile to many biological organisms that destroy wood in the <b>oxygenated</b> <b>waters,</b> provides an excellent testing site for deep water archaeological survey.|$|R
500|$|Like other fish, sharks extract oxygen from {{seawater}} as {{it passes}} over their gills. Unlike other fish, shark gill slits are not covered, but lie in a row behind the head. A modified slit called a spiracle lies just behind the eye, which assists the shark with taking in water during respiration and {{plays a major role}} in bottom‚Äìdwelling sharks. Spiracles are reduced or missing in active pelagic sharks. While the shark is moving, water passes through the mouth and over the gills in a process known as [...] "ram ventilation". While at rest, most sharks pump water over their gills to ensure a constant supply of <b>oxygenated</b> <b>water.</b> A small number of species have lost the ability to pump water through their gills and must swim without rest. These species are obligate ram ventilators and would presumably asphyxiate if unable to move. Obligate ram ventilation is also true of some pelagic bony fish species.|$|E
500|$|A {{blood vessel}} starts from the {{peritoneum}} (the membrane that loosely encloses the stomach), with blind capillaries supplying the stomach. The blood vessel leads {{up the middle}} of the body to a circular vessel {{at the base of the}} lophophore, and from there a single blind vessel runs up each tentacle. A pair of blood vessels near the body wall lead downward from the lophophore ring, and in most species these are combined into one a little below the lophophore ring. The downward vessel(s) leads back to the peritoneum, and also to blind branches throughout the body. There is no heart, but muscles in the major vessels contract in waves to move the blood. Unlike many animals that live in tubes, phoronids do not ventilate their trunks with <b>oxygenated</b> <b>water,</b> but rely on respiration by the lophophore, which extends above hypoxic sediments. The blood has hemocytes containing hemoglobin, which unusual in such small animals and seems to be an adaptation to anoxic and hypoxic environments. The blood of Phoronis [...] architecta carries as much oxygen per cm3 as that of most vertebrates; the blood's volume in cm3 per gm of body weight is twice that of a human.|$|E
2500|$|Gills use a countercurrent {{exchange}} system {{that increases the}} efficiency of oxygen-uptake from the water. Fresh <b>oxygenated</b> <b>water</b> taken in through the mouth is uninterruptedly [...] "pumped" [...] through the gills in one direction, while the blood in the lamellae flows in the opposite direction, creating the countercurrent blood and water flow (Fig. 22), on which the fish's survival depends.|$|E
40|$|Rooted {{aquatic plants}} are {{a natural part}} of the lake {{ecosystem}} and comprise a critical component of a healthy lake.

50|$|This order {{contains}} mostly deep or cold seas sea stars, {{often with}} a wide distribution (sometimes global). They have a pentagonal or star shape, with between 5 and 15 arms. Their skeleton is weakly developed, which confers them a good flexibility, and the numerous papillae which cover their aborale face allow them to breathe in poorly <b>oxygenated</b> <b>waters.</b> Their pedicellariae are often provided with spines. The smallest are Caymanostellidae (between 0,5 and 3 cm) and the biggest Pterasteridae (up to 30 cm).|$|R
2500|$|In certain active pelagic sharks, water {{passes through}} the mouth and over the gills while they are moving, in {{a process known as}} [...] "ram ventilation".

2500|$|Many hypoxic environments {{never reach}} {{the level of}} anoxia and most fish are {{able to cope with}} this stress using {{different}} physiological and behavioural strategies. [...] Fish that use air breathing organs (ABO) tend to live in environments with highly variable oxygen content and rely on aerial respiration during times when there is not enough oxygen to support water-breathing. [...] Though all teleosts have some form of swim bladder, many of them are not capable of breathing air, and they rely on aquatic surface respiration as a supply of more <b>oxygenated</b> <b>water</b> at the surface of the water. [...] However, many species of teleost fish are obligate water breathers and do not display either of these surface respiratory behaviours.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Oxygenated</b> <b>water</b> {{is taken}} into the mantle cavity to the gills and through muscular {{contraction}} of this cavity, the spent water is expelled through the hyponome, created by a fold in the mantle. [...] The size difference between the posterior and anterior ends of this organ control {{the speed of the}} jet the organism can produce. The velocity of the organism can be accurately predicted for a given mass and morphology of animal. [...] Motion of the cephalopods is usually backward as water is forced out anteriorly through the hyponome, but direction can be controlled somewhat by pointing it in different directions. Some cephalopods accompany this expulsion of water with a gunshot-like popping noise, thought to function to frighten away potential predators.|$|E
50|$|The area is well {{renowned for}} its fishing and high water quality. Both Lake Manapouri and Lake Te Anau lie within the ultra-oligotrophic index on the trophic state index with clear highly <b>oxygenated</b> <b>waters</b> of very low {{biological}} productivity. Both lakes along with the connecting Waiau River contain the New Zealand longfin eel and introduced brown trout and rainbow trout {{as well as some}} Atlantic salmon. The area is however free from macrophyte Lagarosiphon major an exotic and invasive species which has infiltrated many other New Zealand lakes.|$|R
50|$|Surrounding the greensand is a ring {{of younger}} Lower Cretaceous Chalk which is about 100 million years old (darker blue on the {{adjacent}} map). The chalk was formed in warm, shallow, well <b>oxygenated</b> <b>waters</b> from the remains of micro-organisms (coccolithophores), over millions of years. At this time the Atlantic Ocean was about 100 miles wide and Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Somerset were a single island with rivers draining their nutrients into the warm sea that covered Wiltshire, Hampshire, the east of England, Northern France, Denmark and northern Germany.|$|R
40|$|Rare earth element (REE) {{contents}} of marine biogenic apatites {{have been shown}} to record seawater compositions. A data base of available and newly acquired rare earth element (REE) {{contents of}} marine biogenic apatites has been created to assess the past seawater REE compositions. To ensure that this data base contains only the pristine REE signals, altered samples, characterized by very low (La/Sm) N ratios (where N stands for REE ratios normalized to the NASC composition; Gromet et al., 1984, Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 48 (1984) 2469) acquired during apatite recrystallization, are not included in the database. These data reveal a change in the Tethyan seawater composition between 110 and 80 Ma. After the end of the Cretaceous, the REE chemistry of seawater remains constant until present-day. This seawater composition change is likely due to concurrent changes in REE scavenging processes. A strong correlation between decreasing (Sm/Yb) N ratios and increasing Ce anomalies for samples deposited during the 80 ‚Äì 110 Ma period is observed. As Ce anomalies are attributed to ocean water redox conditions, changes in REE scavenging could reflect an evolution from stratified and poorly <b>oxygenated</b> <b>waters</b> towards well-mixed and <b>oxygenated</b> <b>waters.</b> This could have resulted from changing current patterns stemming from the contemporaneous opening of the Atlantic Ocean. A major change in Middle and Late Cretaceous oceanic circulation linked to plate tectonics would have favored the colonization of pelagic environments...|$|R
