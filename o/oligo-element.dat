40|$|Like {{the moon}} after {{which it has}} been named – Selene in Greek –, {{selenium}} is an element that has a brigh and a dark side. This <b>oligo-element</b> is essential at a low to moderate level of intake, but becomes toxic at high doses. In Belgium, the recommended values for Se intake have been estimated to be 60 and 70 µg per day for adult women and men respectively. This level of intake is supposed to ensure the maximal activity of the antioxidant selenoenzymes glutathione peroxidases. The Se status of people differs considerably according to the {{regions of the world}} because of the heterogeneous repartition of Se in soils, resulting in variable Se contents in food. In Europe, Se content of soils is naturally low and Belgian people could therefore be at risk of Se deficiency. In addition to the dose, another important determinant of the Se impact on the organism is its speciation, i. e. the chemical form of Se. Different species have been shown to have distinct degrees of bioaccessibility, bioavailability, bioactivity and toxicity. This work aimed to improve the current knowledge about how the nature of Se species influences the degree of Se bioavailability, {{in the context of the}} Se status and food habits of the Belgian population. This research required the development of an analytical method of Se speciation analysis. This method consisted in an enzymatic ultrasonic-assisted extraction of Se, followed by a chromatographic separation of Se species by HPLC in an ion-pairing reversed-phase partitioning mode, and the final detection of 78 Se by ICP-MS in the presence of H 2 as a reaction gas. This work first permitted us to calculate that the average Se intake by the general adult Belgian population is 60 µg Se day- 1, which is at the lower end of the range of recommended intake. Secondly, we measured decreasing degrees of bioavailability for SeMet > MeSeCys > selenate > selenite, and we showed that these degrees of bioavailability were the consequence of distinct modes of intestinal transport among Se species. Finally, we observed that the bioavailability of Se from different Se-enriched food supplements was generally low, especially for selenite-based ones. This work allowed us to formulate an opinion about the suitability of distinct forms of Se in the context of a Se enrichment of the diet, and opened the door to further research in relation to the species-dependence of Se health effects.

40|$|Thermal {{ionization}} isotope dilution {{mass spectrometry}} (TI-IDMS) {{was used as}} an <b>oligo-element</b> method for the determination of Cr, Cd and Pb in photographic AgCl emulsions. After addition of an appropriate amount of isotopically enriched spikes (Cr- 53, Cd- 116 and Pb- 206) to the solid samples, the latter were completely dissolved in NH, solution, permitting isotopic exchange to take place. Thereafter, AgCl was selectively removed by precipitation, whereby ultrasonic treatment was used to enhance the recovery of the elements of interest. Despite the use of concentrated HNO 3 and H 2 O 2 during further sample processing, preliminary experiments indicated the presence of a substantial remainder of the organic matrix (gelatine). Hence, the analytes of interest were isolated by means of electrolytic deposition on Pt electrodes. Subsequently, the deposits were dissolved from the Pt electrodes using a mixture of concentrated HNO 3 and H 2 O 2 and the solutions evaporated to dryness. The solid residues were taken up in diluted HNO 3 and loaded onto Re filaments. In order to improve the ionization yield, prior to the sample, a silicagel suspension containing AlCl 3 was loaded onto the filament and after sample loading, both H 3 BO 3 (for Cr and Pb) and H 3 PO 4 (for Cd and Pb) were added as further ionization aids. Finally, the isotope ratios of interest (Cr- 52 /Cr- 53, Cd- 114 /Cd- 116 and Pb- 206 /Pb- 208) were determined using thermal ionization mass spectrometry, whereby all three analyte elements were vaporized from the same filament. The limits of detection obtained using this procedure range from 0. 4 ng (for Cd) to 4 ng (for Pb). Four different AgCl emulsions were analyzed. For Cr, the concentration found was quite similar for all emulsions analyzed, as it varied between similar to 40 and similar to 100 ng/g only. For Cd, very low values were found for all samples analyzed (less than or equal to 3 ng/g). Finally, for Pb a much larger variation from similar to 10 ng/g up to similar to 5. 5 mu g/g was observed. For the sample with the highest Pb content, an excellent agreement could be established between the results obtained using quadrupole-based ICP-IDMS and those using TI-IDMS. For the determination of Cr by means of quadrupole-based ICP-IDMS, an instrument equipped with a ShieldTorch system was used to avoid spectral overlap of the Cr- 52 (+) and (ArC+) -Ar- 40 -C- 12 ion signals. Also in this case, the results obtained are in very good agreement with those obtained using TI-IDMS. The comparison between TI-IDMS and ICP-IDMS also made clear that sample inhomogeneity limits the between-sample precision attainable...|$|E

30|$|Fluoride is an {{essential}} <b>oligo-element,</b> beneficial {{for the development of}} bone and teeth (McDonagh et al. 2000; Boulétreau et al. 2006; Messaitfa 2008). World Health Organization and Indian Council of Medical Research described the drinking water quality guideline value for fluoride is 1.5  mg/l (World Health Organization (WHO) 1963; Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) 1975). Intake of large quantities of fluoride through drinking water than the optimal safe level is the primary reason for the prevalence of dental and skeletal fluorosis in various parts of world (Chowdhury and Shepherd 1990; Gopalakrishnan et al. 1991; Infante 1975; Gopalakrishnan and Mebrahtom 2006; 2011; Zhu et al. 2006; Karro et al. 2006). Fluorosis is a slow, progressive, crippling malady, which affects every organ, tissue and cell in the body and results in health complaints along overlapping manifestations with several other diseases. Dental fluorosis is characterized by lusterless, opaque white patches in the enamel, which may become stained yellow to dark brown, and in severe forms cause marked pitting and brittleness of teeth. Dental fluorosis is sensitive to even small changes in fluoride exposure from drinking water, and this sensitivity is greater at 1 – 3  years of age than at 4 or 5  years (Burt et al. 2000). Fluoride is present in water as almost completely dissociated fluoride ion from the parent compounds occurring either naturally or in the form of added salts (Jackson et al. 2002; Harrison 2005). Bioavailability of soluble fluoride is largely controlled by acidity in the stomach. Thus, the systemic fluoride absorption from water through the gastrointestinal tract into bloodstream is nearly 100  % by the process of simple diffusion without any intervention of overall water quality (Ekstrand et al. 1978; Rao 1984; Whitford 1994; Whitford 1996; Cerklewski 1997; Maguire et al. 2005; Doull et al. 2006). Hence, water fluoride level is the primary reason for the cause of fluorosis. Fluoride intake from water depends on the amount of water ingested by itself and the quantity of water ingested through food by means of water used for cooking and their fluoride content (Kahama et al. 1997; Karro and Rosentau 2005; Martin 1951; Onyango et al. 2004; Levy 1994; Viswanathan et al. 2009 a, 2010). However, studies indicate that while total fluid intake increases with age and the intake of drinking water decreases after increase of age (Galagan et al., 1957). Fluoride intake level through drinking water itself decreases with increase of age; moreover, 50  % of the total fluoride intake per day is derived from food and beverages (Viswanathan et al. 2009 a, b). Many of the previous studies, from various parts of the world, reported the development of dental fluorosis even if the people consume drinking water with fluoride less than 1.0  mg/l, (Riordan 1993; Clark 1994; Ibrahim et al. 1995; Heller 1997) which implies that the optimal fluoride dose level in drinking water may vary with various features like local climatic conditions, methods of food processing and cooking, (Galagan and Vermillion 1957; Galagan et al. 1957; Khan et al. 2004), amount of food and water intake and its fluoride and other nutrients’ level and dietary habits of the community (Danielsen and Gaarder 1955; Cao et al. 2000; Kaseva 2006). About 80  % of the diseases in world are due to poor quality of drinking water, and the fluoride contamination in drinking water is responsible for 65  % of endemic fluorosis around global (Felsenfeld and Robert 1991; World Health Organization (WHO) 2002). Furthermore, 50  % of the ground water sources in India have been contaminated by fluoride and more than 90  % of rural drinking water supply programmes are based on ground water. A variety of standards and guidelines for exposure to fluoride have been recommended to aid in the protection against dental caries and/or the development of adverse health effects. The National Research Council has estimated “adequate and safe” daily fluoride intakes to be 0.1 – 0.5  mg for infants less than 6  months of age, 0.2 – 1.0  mg for infants between 6 and 12  months, 0.5 – 1.0  mg for {{children between the ages of}} 1 and 3  years, 1.0 – 2.5  mg for 4 - to 6 -year-old children, 1.5 – 2.5  mg for children from 7  years to adulthood and 1.5 – 4.0  mg for adults (National Research Council, NRC 2001). The prevalence of fluorosis in man is reported from 22 states of India, affecting more than 40 million people (Teotia and Teotia 1991; Chinoy 1991; Srikanth et al. 1994; Susheela 2000). The global prevalence of fluorosis is reported to be about 32  % (Mella et al. 1994). The number of people getting affected, the number of villages, blocks, districts and states endemic for fluorosis have been steadily increasing ever since the disease was discovered in India during 1930 s. Many of the people in Manur block of Tirunelveli District, Tamil Nadu, are affected by dental fluorosis. In order to find out the quantitative rate of prevalence of fluorosis and to determine the magnitude of fluoride exposure dose through drinking water among different age groups of people in Manur block, an extensive investigation was performed by estimating fluoride level in drinking water and through clinical survey. Identification of exact geographical location of high fluoride exposed area is much useful to perform remedial measures and is helpful to give awareness about fluorosis to the villagers residing in the particular area. Mapping of fluoride endemic areas is facilitated using Google Earth, because it displays satellite images of most inhabited regions of Earth, allowing users to visually see the exact location with geographical information.|$|E

Serum iron, transferrin saturation, ferritin (RIA) and nuclear magnetic resonance results were compared with invasive findings in order to detect the metal deposition in liver tissue (atomic absorption concentration, optic or electron-microscopic detection). Liver iron overload was observed in 95 % of cases. Full normalization of the disease took place by all the treatments, even if it required slightly more time in the phlebotomy group.

40|$|International audienceThe role of <b>oligo-elements</b> such as Zn in {{the genesis}} of {{pathological}} calcifications is widely debated in the literature. An essential element of discussion is given by their localisation either at the surface or within the Ca apatite crystalline network. To determine the localisation, X-ray absorption experiments have been performed at SOLEIL. The Exafs results suggest that Zn atoms, present in the Zn 2 þ form, are bound to about 4 O atoms {{at a distance of}} 2. 00 Å, while the interatomic distance RCaO ranges between 2. 35 Å and 2. 71 Å. Taking into account the content of Zn (around 1000 ppm) and the difference in ionic radius between Zn 2 þ (0. 074 nm) and Ca 2 þ (0. 099 nm), a significant longer interatomic distance would be expected in the case of Zn replacing Ca within the apatite crystalline network. We thus conclude that Zn atoms are localised at the surface and not in the apatite nanocrystal structure. Such structural result has essential biological implications for at least two reasons. Some oligoelements have a marked effect on the transformation of chemical phases, and may modify the morphology of crystals. These are both major issues because, in the case of kidney stones, the medical treatment depends strongly on the precise chemical phase and on the morphology of the biological entities at both macroscopic and mesoscopic scales...|$|R

However, plantlets regeneration from cultures derived from matured embryos is usually low. In this study, we tested matured embryos as explants from eight Moroccan durum wheat varieties (‘Irden’, ‘Marzak’, ‘Kyperounda’, ‘Isly’, ‘Amria’, ‘Karim’, ‘Marouane’ and ‘Tomouh’) to define suitable culture media for obtaining high frequencies of somatic embryogenesis and in vitro plantlets regeneration. For this purpose, we tested five induction and maintenance media (M 1 to M 5) based on MS media (macro and <b>oligo-elements)</b> which differed with respect to concentrations of plant hormones (2, 4 -D and BA), vitamins, sucrose, maltose, L-asparagine, and solidifying agents. All tested media induced embryogenic callus for the varieties and regenerate plantlets. However, a significant effect of variety, medium and variety × medium interaction were observed for callus induction and regeneration. Average callus growth as measured by relative fresh weight growth rate (RFWGR) across different media was the highest for ‘Amria’ (7215. 4 %) and the lowest for ‘Tomouh’ (2088. 2 %). M 1 (2 mg/L 2, 4 -D) and M 5 (3 mg/L 2, 4 -D) media gave highest RFWGR(6892. 1 % and 6332 %, respectively) and M 3 (1 mg/L 2, 4 -D) was the lowest (3708. 8 %), across different varieties.

40|$|International audienceFrom this {{detailed}} analysis of the main dietary trials conducted over the last 30 years in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, {{it can be said that}} the older trials were conducted on low risk patients and used high fat diets (about 40 % of energy as lipids), comprising low saturated fat and cholesterol intake but very high (15 to 20 % of energy) polyunsaturated fat intake, particularly from the omega- 6 fatty acid family. These experimental diets were designed to reduce blood cholesterol and failed to improve prognosis. By contrast, recent trials were not primarily designed to reduce cholesterol, were conducted in medium- and high-risk patients and used low fat diets supplemented by omega- 3 fatty acids from various sources. In two of these trials, the consumption of natural antioxidants, oligoelements and vegetable proteins was increased. Recurrence rate was reduced in the range of 30 to 70 %. One conclusion from these well-conducted recent experiments on more than 3000 patients is that new and more specific dietary recommendations are clearly warranted in secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. They should be more specific and more clearly defined and therefore different from those generally provided in the U. S. A. and Europe at present. In a recent Consensus Panel statement, authors wrote less than one line to describe a cardioprotective diet in patients with coronary heart disease, summarized as < or = 30 % fat, < 7 % saturated fat, < 200 mg. day- 1 cholesterol. This is both too much (too restrictive to hope that white European and American patients will adhere in the long-term) and insufficient because dietary counselling cannot be restricted to three factors. Ulbricht and Southgate recently emphasized that the relationship between diet and coronary heart disease is more complex than the current cholesterol hypothesis. They identified at least seven major dietary factors, including fibres, although the evidence of an effect on coronary heart disease is weak. However, they did not mention vegetable and fish proteins which are rich in arginine and L-glutamine, major regulators of cardiovascular function. Thus, new dietary advice should include: reduce intake of total (not more than 30 % of energy) and saturated (less than 10 %) fats maintain intake at least minimally, of the essential omega- 6 fatty acids augment consumption of oleic acid and moderately increase consumption of omega- 3 fatty acids augment intake of natural antioxidants and <b>oligo-elements</b> maintain sufficient intake of vegetable proteins As conceptualized in the 'Mediterranean' and 'Asian-vegetarian' types of diet, it is very important that a healthy diet should be thought of as a whole rather than as a recitation of good and bad components. Although these protective dietary modifications should probably all be used in each patient to obtain maximal efficacy, these scientifically quantitated principles should be adapted to the culture, ethnic origin and 'image of the world' of each patient in order to create an environment favourable to the perception of positive associations between various foods and healthy habits...|$|R
40|$|Human {{cells and}} tissues are key systems to study human biology and physiology, {{and to develop}} new {{strategies}} and targeting drugs for human diseases. Since the study and testing on human beings may not be acceptable due to exposure to risks and practical and ethical concerns, in vitro strategies are of paramount importance to rely on human organism and avoid non-fully predictive animal models. The demand of research in clinical and industrial fields for effective, representative and affordable strategies is undoubtedly increasing. Conventional cell culture systems and drug discovery are normally performed in vessels with a characteristic dimension {{in the order of}} centimeters. Nutrients are delivered to cells through liquid media containing balanced saline buffers and <b>oligo-elements.</b> A reasonable amount of medium is necessary to homogeneously cover a cell layer and must exchanged with fresh media to maintain a proper amount of available nutrients and remove released waste products. Many studies and applications require expensive reagents and are subjected to limited data throughput. The discovery of reprogramming process by 2012 Nobel Prize Yamanaka opened breakthrough new perspective on research and clinical applications. Basically, from a patient’s skin biopsy it is now possible to derive induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and to obtain new tissues for an ad hoc self-repair. So far, human iPSC (hiPSC) have not been applied to clinics due to some unexplored aspects on their derivation, non clinical-grade methods and the significative cost of hiPSC derivation per patient. The down-scale of reprogramming process could provide an unique opportunity to derive cost-effective hiPSC and obtain valuable human in vitro tissues. The aim of this thesis is the development of a comprehensive platform for the reprogramming of human cells at the microscale. To this end, we focused on the development of cell microenvironment which is composed by both soluble and solid components. During this thesis, synthetic and biodegradable hydrogels were developed. The large-scale production of mechanically-tunable poly-acrylamide-based substrates were fundamental to reveal the interaction occurring between substrate stiffness and cell behavior and fate. Engineering of biodegradable hydrogels has revealed the potential to develop in vitro functional tissues and to integrate them at a later stage in patients. Chemical modifications were transferred to topological substrate control and in turn in microfluidic platforms. Microfluidic chip environment and management was designed in order to allow long-term adhesion, culture and biologically relevant cell behaviors. Adhesion proteins fundamental for cell attachment and growth were modified and integrated with the micronized substrates. Since medium for microfluidic cell culture relies on perfusion, continuous or periodic flow could be applied. Thus, we studied the management of media delivery {{in order to determine the}} best strategy for long-term cell cultures. The achievements obtained with both substrate and microfluidic cell culture development was applied to the generation of a new platform for hiPSC derivation, differentiation and testing at the microscale. For the first time, it is possible to obtain human iPSC clones in microfluidics with a remarked reduction of minimum requirements (materials, reagents, overall expenses). The production of cost effective hiPSC can lead to a mass production of characterized and functional tissues that can be either integrated in 3 D developed constructs and serve as valuable tissue source derivation for drug development. Our platform opens new perspectives in studying and treating both abundant and rare diseases involving both scientists and entrepreneur...|$|R
