The {{purpose of this}} dissertation was to document the perspectives and attitudes of secondary education teachers and administrators about the perceived benefits and challenges of integrating new Emerging Learning Technologies (ELTs) in the classroom. Education {{has become one of}} the biggest challenges in the African nation of Burkina Faso where teachers are routinely confronted with material shortages, lack of curriculum, lack of equipment, and lack of opportunity for self-conducted learning. To overcome these challenges, educators are using Emerging Learning Technologies (ELTs) to help improve the quality of teaching and to increase student access to these learning opportunities. This study examined three core questions that specifically focused is on the ways in which ELTs are perceived as different from previously used technologies in Burkina Faso (i. e., radio and television). 1. What are the perspectives of secondary level educators and administrators regarding the use <b>of</b> <b>ELTs</b> in Burkina Faso? 2. In the local educational contexts of cities and rural areas, how do educators and administrators experience the use <b>of</b> <b>ELTs</b> in education? 3. What are the benefits and challenges <b>of</b> using <b>ELTs</b> for educational purposes in Burkina Faso? Study findings indicated that the pedagogical use <b>of</b> <b>ELTs</b> in secondary education was not contributing to teaching and learning in secondary schools at this time. Analysis of the collected data found that the added value of the use <b>of</b> <b>ELTs</b> in education depended mainly on their daily adaption by students, teachers, and administrative staff. However, the use <b>of</b> <b>ELTs</b> in secondary education in Burkina Faso is infrequent and not widely embraced by school administrators and teachers. Future adoption <b>of</b> <b>ELTs</b> may someday impact educational outcomes but it will take more than top-down political directives to achieve this outcome...|$|R

40|$|Thermo-chemical {{treatments}} (mainly pyrolysis) {{directed towards}} energy and products recovery provide a very promising alternative to open space disposal or landfilling, reducing {{in the process}} hazardous waste and potential contamination to soil and water resources. In this communication, we present results of end <b>of</b> life tyres (<b>ELTs)</b> pyrolysis via isothermal and dynamic thermogravimetry <b>of</b> two <b>ELT</b> grades. The {{aim of this study}} is to demonstrate the possibility of utilizing a pre-set temperature (T-c = 500 degrees C) pyrolysis process (conversion time, t(c), of 120 s). to the benefit of intensifying the global product yields recovered. A novel engineering kinetics approach was undertaken to propose a thermal cracking scheme of four primary and two secondary side reactions. Thermal degradation <b>of</b> <b>ELTs</b> was taken from a depolymerization approach of the present polyisoprene polymer in the tyres, resulting in a high regression of 0. 959. The products <b>of</b> <b>ELTs</b> pyrolysis were lumped into four categories, namely aromatics, liquids, char and gases. The thermal cracking model evaluation of kinetic rate constants and lumped products showed a regression ranging between 0. 90 and 0. 94. Dynamic runs were performed to extend the model derived, taking into account heating rate (beta) influence and products prediction and interaction. The results obtained can be used in designing industrial ELTs pyrolysis units. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. ...|$|R
40|$|Emerging {{learning}} technologies (ELTs) {{have become}} a core facet of university life, but their role {{in teaching and learning}} is contested, and generally, not wellunderstood. By analyzing the perceptions of both academics and students towards ELTs, this paper aims to expand understanding of the role <b>of</b> <b>ELTs</b> in teaching and learning in one school in a research intensive university. Online surveys completed by both academics and students and smaller focus groups identified diverse perspectives on the uses <b>of</b> <b>ELTs</b> in the processes of learning in higher education. These results inform a strategic planning process at the school level to implement an Emerging Learning Technologies Preparedness Plan. Moreover, this discourse on the role of, costs and opportunities that ELTs afford is significant and timely to look at how to take a whole-of-school approach; and identify and evaluate pedagogical principles that foster active teaching and learning practices. 7 page(s...|$|R

Therefore, this study focused on exploring English language teachers 2 ̆ 7 (ELTs 2 ̆ 7) professional development (PD) in developing countries; namely Syria and Pakistan. For approaching this phenomenon, the study used qualitative research with a case-study design. Moreover, it applied the auto/biographical approach to get more insights into ELTs 2 ̆ 7 learning experiences by analyzing the stories <b>of</b> two <b>ELTs.</b> Furthermore, it employed cross-case analysis to identify the emerging issues in both contexts (Syria and Pakistan), {{and to find out}} some similarities/differences <b>of</b> <b>ELTs</b> 2 ̆ 7 learning experiences between these contexts. The study was conducted in a private secondary English-medium school in Karachi with a Pakistani ELT and me, as a research participant from Syria. Reflective journals, semi-structured interviews, ELTs 2 ̆ 7 auto/biography, documents analysis, informal talks and classroom, observations were used for generating the data for this study. Analyzing the data, some key themes emerged in relation to the process of achieving PD <b>of</b> <b>ELTs.</b> Out <b>of</b> these themes, stories were generated about ELTs 2 ̆ 7 learning journey.

Many up and coming New York actors have performed with ELT. In 2014, ELT produced a reading of David Garrick's Catherine and Petruchio, a rarely performed 18th Century adaptation of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew, as well as a presentation of short plays by John Ladd, and KK Gordon, at the NYPL George Bruce Theater. In 2015, they presented a reading of short plays by writers from the Provincetown Playhouse and other early 20th century NYC writers, including OVERTONES by Alice Gerstenberg, as well as a new play by Pamela Robbins, and a staged reading of THE FATHER. The Village Light Opera Guild joined them for a musical cabaret in 2016 as a benefit. Their new play festival is now in its seventh year. ELT encourages writers and actors to pursue their craft in this space. ELT performs at the George Bruce Theater on West 125th street and at the Alvin Ailey auditorium on West 115th street, courtesy of the NYPL. To date, ELT has premiered more than 120 new plays by talented writers, many moving to success around the country.|$|E
40|$|Most of the {{research}} into ELT has focused on its linguistic and methodological aspects, {{which are based on}} Western scientific traditions. The contributions and experiences of English language teachers themselves, especially their work in overseas contexts, have frequently been overlooked. This volume aims to document the complexity <b>of</b> <b>ELT</b> as ‘work’ in new global economic and cultural conditions, and to explore how this complexity is realised in the everyday experiences <b>of</b> <b>ELT</b> teachers. The development <b>of</b> <b>ELT</b> from the colonial experience to its current status as a global commodity is explored; ELT is then situated in the discourses of globalisation, specifically within Appadurai’s theorisation of global flows of people, images, ideas, technology and money, or scapes. Within this framework, narratives are constructed from the experiences of Native-speaking English teachers. These reveal much about the personal, pedagogical and cultural dimensions <b>of</b> <b>ELT</b> work in non-Centre countries, and will contribute to a greater understanding of the intercultural dimensions <b>of</b> <b>ELT</b> for all those who work in it, and in related educational fields...|$|E
