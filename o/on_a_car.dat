5|$|On February 13, 1994, State Judicial Police arrested Puentes Pizaña in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> theft charge. In an {{interview}} the following day, {{he said he}} was not guilty of Fischer's murder, and claimed he was at his mother's house in Matamoros when the murder occurred. He insisted that neither he nor Olivarez were gun owners or users. U.S. officials noted that it was unlikely for Mexico to extradite Puentes Pizaña since the extradition treaty between both countries did not cover Mexican nationals, and because Texas has the death penalty, which is outlawed in Mexico. Reynosa officials stated that Puentes Pizaña would have to face charges in Mexico before an extradition could be considered. Car theft sentences ranged from three to ten years in prison. Puentes Pizaña, on the other hand, argued that facing trial in the U.S. would not guarantee a fair trial. South Texas officials stated that there was a possibility for Puentes Pizaña to be tried in Mexico for Fischer's murder if an agreement was made between Texan and Tamaulipas state officials, though they said that trying him in the U.S. was unlikely.|$|E
