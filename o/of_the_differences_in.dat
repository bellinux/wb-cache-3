5|$|Body adaptations, {{especially}} a paddle-like tail, help banded sea kraits to swim. These adaptations {{are also found}} in more distantly related sea snakes (Hydrophiinae) because of convergent evolution. However, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> motion between crawling and swimming, these same adaptations impede the snake's terrestrial motion. On dry land, a banded sea krait can still move, but, on average, at only slightly more than a fifth of its swimming speed. In contrast, most other non-Laticauda sea snakes are virtually stranded on dry land.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, Eaton {{became the}} first {{scientist}} to publish a more {{detailed description of the}} entire Pteranodon skeleton, as it was known at the time. He used his findings to revise the classification of the genus once again based on a better understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> pteranodont anatomy. Eaton conducted experiments using clay models of bones to help determine the effects of crushing and flattening on the shapes of the arm bones Williston had used in his own classification. Eaton found that most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> bone shapes could be easily explained by the pressures of fossilization, and concluded that no Pteranodon skeletons had any significant differences from each other besides their size. Therefore, Eaton was left to decide his classification scheme based on differences in the skulls alone, which he assigned to species just as Marsh did, by their size. In the end, Eaton recognized only three valid species: P. occidentalis, P. ingens, and P. longiceps.|$|E

5|$|Phreatomagmatic eruptions are eruptions {{that arise}} from {{interactions}} between water and magma. They are driven from thermal contraction (as opposed to magmatic eruptions, which are driven by thermal expansion) of magma when it comes in contact with water. This temperature {{difference between the two}} causes violent water-lava interactions that make up the eruption. The products of phreatomagmatic eruptions are believed to be more regular in shape and finer grained than the products of magmatic eruptions because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> eruptive mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, {{the third}} species, P. cyrtocristatus was named by John Ostrom. Its three known specimens, {{have been found}} in the Fruitland and Kaiparowits {{formations}} from Utah and New Mexico. The second specimen, the first known from the Kaiparowits Formation, was originally unassigned to a specific taxon. Of the Parasaurolophus species, P. cyrtocristatus it is the smallest, and has the most curved crest. Because of its possession of the two above features, it has often been speculated that it was a female of P. walkeri or P. tubicen, which were males, although P. tubicen lived approximately a million years later. As noted by Thomas Williamson, the type material of P. cyrtocristatus is about 72% the size of P. tubicen, close to the size at which other lambeosaurines are interpreted to begin showing definitive sexual dimorphism in their crests (~70% of adult size). Even though many scientists have supported the possible fact of P. cyrtocristatus being a female, many other studies have found that it is not, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> age, distribution, and the large differences in the crest and its internal structure.|$|E

Argentina defines rums as white, gold, light, and extra light. Grenada and Barbados uses the terms white, overproof, and matured, while the United States defines rum, rum liqueur, and flavored rum.

25|$|Within {{the same}} snail {{population}} {{and under the}} same conditions, some snails will grow faster than others. Some will take twice as long to mature. This may help the species survive bad weather, etc., in the wild.

By selecting only the largest, the average size of the snail may increase significantly in {{only a couple of}} generations. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> growth are probably due to environmental factors including stocking density. However, to whatever extent these differences are genetic, farmers generally breed large, fast-growing snails instead of small, slower-growing ones.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevailing}} {{winds of}} the atmospheric circulation arise {{because of the}} difference in pressure at various latitudes and act as means for distribution of thermal energy on the planet. This pressure difference is because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> solar insolation received at different latitudes and the resulting uneven heating of the planet. Alternating belts of high pressure and low pressure develop along the equator, the two tropics, the Arctic and Antarctic circles, and the two polar regions, giving rise to the trade winds, the westerlies, and the polar easterlies. However, geophysical factors like Earth's orbit, its rotation, and its axial tilt cause these belts to shift gradually north and south, following the Sun's seasonal shifts.|$|E
