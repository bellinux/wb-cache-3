According to {{the information on the}} processes of <b>cereals</b> washing, cooking, <b>drying</b> and cooling microprocessor provides regime parameters control under the restrictions due to both yield of cooked and <b>dried</b> <b>cereal</b> of high quality and economic feasibility. At the same time the amount of moisture is continuously determined in the recirculation loop formed by the evaporation from the <b>cereals</b> in the <b>drying</b> process.

40|$|Environmental {{and human}} {{exposures}} to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are of emerging concern {{since they are}} persistent and bioaccumulative. The present study reports PFASs levels in human milk, infant formulas and baby food (<b>dry</b> <b>cereals</b> and pots) from the Valencian Community (Spain) in order to evaluate the infant exposure to these substances through the diet. The results show that perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were in all the samples of the four selected matrices (except PFOA in one sample of <b>dry</b> <b>cereal</b> baby food). Perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA) and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) were also detected in 70 % of the breast milk samples. In infant formulas, PFDA and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) were detected in 75 % and 69 %, respectively. In <b>dry</b> <b>cereals</b> baby food, PFBA was in 100 % of the samples while PFOA and PFOS in 92 %. In baby food pots, PFDA was also detected in 83 % of the samples. Estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of PFOA (maximum 32. 2  ng kg day) and PFOS (9. 0  ng kg day) are lower than tolerable daily intakes (TDIs) established for PFOA (1500  ng kg day) and PFOS (150  ng kg day).

40|$|International audienceThe {{maintenance}} of fallows {{has been shown}} to prevent the loss of farmland biodiversity caused by agricultural intensification. These are mainly introduced as part of both obligatory and voluntary set-aside schemes. However, the obligatory set-aside has recently been abolished by the Common Agricultural Policy Health Check. In this study, we examine the role of fallow in fine-grained habitat use by a threatened farmland bird (Lesser Kestrel) during summer in northwestern Spain. To analyze Lesser Kestrel occurrence, we used generalized linear models, a theoretic-information approach and a hierarchical partitioning analysis. The best AIC-based models explaining occurrence of Lesser Kestrels showed that fallow was the more important habitat type followed, to a lesser extent, by <b>dry</b> <b>cereal</b> stubble and field margin. In contrast, irrigated crops negatively influenced occurrence. Heterogeneity of crop mosaic was not important in explaining occurrence of Lesser Kestrel. Fallows, like <b>dry</b> <b>cereal</b> stubbles and field margins, seem to be suitable for foraging given the abundance of high food resources and their availability due to shorter vegetation cover. The abolition of the obligatory set-aside could reduce the total surface of fallow land (approximately 40. 9 %), likely affecting habitat use by Lesser Kestrel through an increase of other non-preferred crops (e. g., irrigated crops) or by decreasing food resources. Agri-environment schemes focusing on the {{maintenance of}} low-intensive farming systems with a mosaic of crops and semi-natural habitats interspersed should be promoted in premigratory areas to maintain Lesser Kestrel...|$|R

40|$|The {{intensification}} of agriculture has increased {{production at the}} cost of environment and biodiversity worldwide. To increase crop yield in <b>dry</b> <b>cereal</b> systems, vast farmland areas of high conservation value are being converted into irrigation, especially in Mediterranean countries. We analyze the effect of irrigation-driven changes on the farm biota by comparing species diversity, community composition, and species traits of arable plants within crop fields from two contrasting farming systems (dry and irrigated) in Spain. We sampled plant species within 80 fields of dry wheat, irrigated wheat, and maize (only cultivated under irrigation). Wheat crops held higher landscape and per field species richness, and beta diversity than maize. Within the same type ofÂ crop, irrigated wheat hosted lower plant diversity than dry wheat at both field and landscape scales. Floristic composition differed between crop types, with higher frequencies of perennials, cosmopolitan, exotic, wind-pollinated and C species in maize. Our results suggest that irrigation projects, that transform large areas of <b>dry</b> <b>cereal</b> agro-ecosystems into irrigated crop systems dominated by maize, erode plant diversity. An adequate planning on the type and proportion of crops used in the irrigated agro-ecosystems is needed in order to balance agriculture production and biodiversity conservation.
