40|$|Maintenance cost {{is one of}} the {{important}} issues in railway heavy haul operations. For the iron-ore company LKAB, these costs are mainly associated with the reprofiling and changing of the wheels of the locomotives and wagons. The main reason for the wheel damages is usually surface initiated rolling contact fatigue (RCF) on the wheels. The present work tries to enhance and improve the knowledge of the vehicle-track interaction of the Swedish iron-ore freight wagons and locomotives used at Malmbanan. The study is divided into two parts. Firstly, it is tried to get into the roots of RCF using the simulation model of the iron <b>ore</b> <b>wagon</b> (Paper A). Secondly, the study is focused on predicting wear and RCF on the locomotive wheels also via a dynamic simulation model (Paper B). In the first paper, some key issues of the dynamic modelling of the wagons with three piece bogies are first discussed and then parameter studies are carried out to find the most important reasons of wheel damages. These parameter studies include track design geometry, track irregularities, wheel-rail friction level, cant deficiency and track stiffness. The results show a significant effect of the friction level on the amount of RCF risk. As the locomotive wheel life is much shorter than that of the wagons, LKAB has decided to change the locomotive wheel profile. Two final wheel profiles are proposed; however, one had to be approved for the field tests. In the second paper, the long term evolution of the two profiles is compared via wear simulation analysis. Also, the RCF evolution on the wheel profiles as a function of running distance is discussed. The process is first carried out for the current locomotive wheel profiles and the results are compared with the measurements. Good agreement is achieved. Finally, one of the proposed profiles is suggested for the field test because of the mild wear and RCF propagation. QC 20150210 </p...|$|E

40|$|The mining group Loussavaara Kiirunavaara AB {{manufactures}} {{and supplies}} processed raw materials of iron ore, {{which is a}} popular product around the world. To meet the high demand, a high production rate has to be maintained. LKAB has the goal of delivering at least 37 million tons of iron ore per year, by 2015 [...] LKAB has developed a new iron <b>ore</b> <b>wagon,</b> where a series of over a thousand wagons, have already been delivered by the company Kockums Industrier. In an effort to achieve the aforementioned production target, LKAB is looking into further maximize the ore loads on the wagons. The goal {{of this study is}} to analyze how the wagon behaves with a higher payload. In order to limit the scope of the study, limitations is made to the critical areas of the frame. The method is based on theoretical analyzes to determine the stress range, which occurs in the frame when the wagon is in operation. The stress results are then used along with the measurement data for determining the fatigue behavior of the frame. In broad terms the method of analysis are summarized as follows: 1. Problem formulation. 2. Computation. 3. Validation. The formulation of the problem is stated with the geometry, materials and the dynamics acting on the wagon, but also with the requirements; in this case, a fatigue life of at least 20 years for the frame of the wagon. The dynamics (load) acting on the wagon is determined primarily based on measurements, but a comparison is also made to the conservative given accelerations specified in the Swedish railway standard (reference [8]). The problem is then computed based on the problem formulation (1). A numerical stress computation is performed but also an analytically stress computation. The results from the numerical stress computation along with the measured number of load cycles (during operation) is then used to analyze the fatigue behavior of the wagon for 20 years of operation. As the stress calculation and fatigue calculations are performed the results are validated against laboratory tests. In comparison to the measured stress (at testing), the results from the numerical stress computation (static computation) are validated with good accuracy in the critical areas. The validation of the fatigue computation indicates that the result is on the safe side compared to the measured data. With the condition that the the load is increased by 10 tonnes and with the current operating conditions, the wagon is adequate for 20 years of life, with a good margin.

40|$|From 2000 to 2015, {{the cost}} of {{operation}} and maintenance (including reinvestment) and traffic control has increased from approximately three billion to over nine billion Swedish kronor annually. By making more frequent measurements of track irregularities and identifying trends earlier, accurate and effective maintenance can be performed. Therefore, in the industry and academy, different measurement solutions are tested to measure the state of railroad tracks in a simple and more frequent manner. One of the solutions is to use measuring systems mounted on trains in regular traffic. By using regular scheduled services, a higher cost effectiveness regarding inspection frequency can be achieved. When the measuring equipment is mounted on freight trains, a measurement with considerably higher axle load can also be performed. In {{the course of this}} work, a literature study have been conducted and a number of scientific articles and reports have been studied at depth. There is a number of different systems that have been manufactured to be mounted on rolling stock in regular service. Different solutions are applied to perform the measurements. Acceleration sensors are robust and reliable, which is necessary because they will be mounted in an exposed environment. A difference that has been identified is the installation of accelerometer sensors that are either mounted before or after the primary suspension. Before suspension the sensors are mounted on the axle box and, after suspension the sensors are mounted on the train bogie. The engineering company Damill is working within monitoring solutions and has developed equipment for mounting on trains in regular traffic called Tracklogger. Earlier evaluations of the equipment have been made with focus on comparison with machine inspections. There is a difference between the technology used in track recording vehicles and the technology that Tracklogger uses, such comparison is not entirely appropriate. In discussion with Damill the focus of this work has been to see if recordings of switches can be linked to maintenance actions. Since the equipment is in the development stage {{it is important that the}} measurement data collected is critically reviewed with regard to what information it delivers. The measurements have been carried out on switches in the main train track on track number 119 between Luleå and Boden and the mining company LKAB's <b>ore</b> <b>wagon</b> has been a tool carrier.   Five out of eight cases, a maintenance action can be linked to reduced measured values of switches with fixed crossing points. In one case, maintenance action has increased the measured value. In two cases, there is no signifcant difference in the measured value associated with maintenance actions. In previous evaluation, it was determined that it is good repeatability in the measured position, but not as high repeatability in the measured size. A number of switches have been studied to check the repeatability of the measurement. As the train runs in acircle run in Luleå harbor, there will be a limited number of occasions the equipment is running in the same direction in combination with the sensors on the same axle in the bogie, which may effect the measurement results. When analyzing the repeatability of five passages where the direction of travel is not taken into account, it is determined that three out of five passages show a good repeatability. The repeatability of the measurement is suspected of being related to the condition, as significantly greater differences in the measured signal are obtained just before a maintenance action has been taken...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe real {{friction}} coefficients {{between the}} rails and the wheels on a 360 t and 10, 800 kW IORE locomotive were measured using the locomotive׳s in-built traction force measurement system. The locomotive {{consisted of two}} pair-connected locomotives had a CoCo+CoCo bogie configuration, and hauled a fully loaded set of 68 <b>ore</b> <b>wagons</b> (120 t/wagon). The measurements were performed both on rails in a dry condition and on rails lubricated with a water-based top-of-rail (ToR) friction modifier on the Iron Ore Line between the cities of Kiruna and Narvik in Northern Sweden and Norway, respectively. Since full-scale measurements like these are costly, the friction coefficients were also measured {{at the same time}} and place using a conventional hand-operated tribometer, with and without the ToR friction modifier. The most important results are that the real friction coefficient is definitely not constant and is surprisingly low (0. 10 – 0. 25) when the ToR friction modifier is used, and that it is also significantly dependent on the amount of ToR friction modifier. A large amount will reduce the friction coefficient. Furthermore, it is concluded that the real friction coefficients are in general lower than the friction coefficients measured with the hand-operated tribometer. A final remark is thus that the use of a water-based ToR friction modifier can give excessively low friction, which can result in unacceptably long braking distances...|$|R
