5|$|If it {{is unclear}} what counts as science, how the process of {{confirming}} theories works, and what the purpose <b>of</b> <b>science</b> is, there is considerable scope for values and other social influences to shape science. Indeed, values can play a role ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensus. For example, in the 19th century, cultural values held by scientists about race shaped research on evolution, and values concerning social class influenced debates on phrenology (considered scientific at the time). Feminist philosophers <b>of</b> <b>science,</b> sociologists <b>of</b> <b>science,</b> and others explore how social values affect science.|$|E
