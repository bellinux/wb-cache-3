5|$|Although males {{demonstrate}} little {{involvement in}} territorial disputes between neighboring communities, and ruffed lemur communities lack cohesiveness, females communally defend the community range against females of <b>other</b> <b>communities.</b> These disputes occur mostly during the hot, rainy season, when resources are more abundant and occur near {{the boundaries of}} community ranges. Spacing is maintained by scent marking and vocal communication. Ruffed lemurs {{are known for their}} loud, raucous calls that are answered by neighboring communities and subgroups within the same community.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to initial}} reports of monogamy, ruffed lemurs {{in the wild}} exhibit {{seasonal}} polygamous breeding behavior, with {{both males and females}} mating with more than one partner within a single season. Mating is not restricted to just community members, but also involves members of neighboring communities. Females mate primarily with males with whom they had affiliative relations prior to mating season, although some matings occurred with roaming males from <b>other</b> <b>communities.</b>|$|E

5|$|As Galveston's {{traditional}} economy declined, Texas' {{oil boom}} began in 1901, with oil wells and refineries constructed throughout the state. Galveston's direct {{role in this}} boom was minimal as investors avoided building pipelines and refineries on the island itself (though for a time oil was shipped through the island). Nevertheless, wealth {{brought on by the}} boom transformed nearby Houston, Texas City, Goose Creek (modern Baytown), and <b>other</b> <b>communities.</b> Houston in particular became home to a large community of wealthy businessmen and investors. Galveston became even more tourism-focused as the city sought to attract these nearby nouveau riche. Still, in the first two decades after the 1900 storm, the city's economy struggled to recover.|$|E
5|$|Deerfield and <b>other</b> <b>communities</b> {{collected}} {{funds to}} ransom the captives. French authorities and colonists also worked to extricate the captives from their Indian captors. Within a year's time, {{most of the}} captives were in French hands, a product of frontier commerce in humans that was fairly common at the time on both sides. The French and converted Indians worked to convert their captives to Roman Catholicism, with modest success. While adult captives proved fairly resistant to proselytizing, children were more receptive or likely to accept conversion under duress.|$|E

Recently, the Asian population in Texas has grown—primarily in Houston and Dallas. <b>Other</b> <b>communities</b> with a significantly growing Asian American population is in Austin, Corpus Christi, and the Sharyland area next McAllen, Texas.

5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of Baghdadi Jews in India, the Jews {{residing}} in Bombay — the name then used for Mumbai — had settled in the towns of India, living peacefully with <b>other</b> <b>communities</b> in India.

They found that living in India, amidst a cosmopolitan community consisting of Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and, much later, Muslims, was a very cordial environment, totally free of anti-Semitic feelings.|$|E
