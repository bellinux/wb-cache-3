5|$|In February 1943, the United States Department of War {{announced}} {{they would take}} over both classroom space and athletic facilities at 271 colleges and universities to be utilized for the training of United States Army soldiers. As part of the Department's order, only students under 18 {{years of age or}} those with 4-F draft classifications were permitted to compete in intercollegiate athletics. At the time of the announcement, coach Thomas was quoted as saying:"Army–Navy programs not figured at all in <b>our</b> <b>plans</b> for athletics next fall."As such, preparations continued towards fielding a team for the 1943 season. On March 8, spring practice commenced at Denny Stadium and 55 student-athletes reported the first day. At that time coach Thomas acknowledged {{he did not know how}} many of his players would be eligible to play in the fall due to rules the prohibited active-duty servicemen playing intercollegiate football. As they entered practice, only 15 lettermen returned to the squad from the 1942 team. These players included: Jack Aland, Johnny August, Bill Baughman, Andy Bires, Charley Compton, Ted Cook, Leon Fichman, Ted McKosky, Jim McWhorter, Norman Mosley, Mitchell Olenski, Kenny Reese, Lou Scales, John Staples and Don Whitmire. Two weeks into the practices, coach Thomas held the first scrimmage of the spring on March 22.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the final, the GAA {{stated that}} the All-Ireland final post-match {{presentation}} of the Liam MacCarthy Cup would {{be returned to the}} centre of the pitch. The Association were considering a return to the centre of Croke Park for All-Ireland day presentations since the 2008 football decider between Tyrone and Kerry when Kerry's Colm Cooper was jostled by rival supporters as he left the field following the final whistle. From 1999 to 2001, presentations were made in the centre of Croke Park and passed off largely without incident. However, a pitch invasion by fans following the 2009 hurling final meant plans to change the style of trophy presentation were cancelled, with Kilkenny captain Michael Fennelly receiving the Liam MacCarthy Cup in the Hogan Stand of Croke Park. GAA President Christy Cooney later spoke of his disappointment about the pitch invasion but indicated that it confirmed his belief that the invasions must stop. He said: Despite all pre-match communications, press publicity and big-screen appeals, it was extremely disappointing to see <b>our</b> <b>plans</b> were not realised. Even allowing for all the exuberance and joy of supporters on the day, it was disappointing to see the disregard for the safety of others amongst fans intent on getting on the pitch and ignoring safety appeals. The Kilkenny County Board later complained about the presentation.|$|E

[...] Instead the Allies landed at low tide, which increased {{the length of the}} beach to be crossed but uncovered and revealed the obstacles, greatly reducing their effectiveness.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the success}} of the band's {{previous}} albums Almost There and Spoken For, MercyMe was given [...] "significantly" [...] more resources to develop their next record by their record label, INO Records. Although they decided not to alter their Christian approach to songwriting, live performances, and interviews, they opted to work with outside songwriters on the album, employed the London Symphony Orchestra to play strings on several tracks, and added a sixth member to the band, guitarist Barry Graul. Additionally, MercyMe wrote and recorded the music for Undone before they wrote any of the lyrics. Lead singer Bart Millard noted that by using this method, instead of his lyrics swaying the musical elements of the song, the music acted as [...] "a canvas with which to write [...] ". He elaborated that [...] "We’ve been making records for 10 years, so anything that sparks creativity... is very much welcomed". The title of the album was inspired by [...] "the unexpected twists and turns in the band's journey"; Millard commented that [...] "We had <b>our</b> <b>plans</b> for {{what we were going to}} do; but when the bigger picture happened, all of <b>our</b> <b>plans</b> came unraveled. We don’t know what tomorrow will hold. When you make your own plans, you suddenly find yourself undone; and that’s exactly where God wants us in the first place".|$|E
500|$|On 10 June, the Imperial Japanese Navy {{conveyed}} {{to the military}} liaison conference an incomplete picture {{of the results of}} the battle. Chūichi Nagumo's detailed battle report was submitted to the high command on 15 June. It was intended only for the highest echelons in the Japanese Navy and government, and was guarded closely throughout the war. In it, one of the more striking revelations is the comment on the Mobile Force Commander's (Nagumo's) estimates: [...] "The enemy is not aware of <b>our</b> <b>plans</b> (we were not discovered until early in the morning of the 5th at the earliest)." [...] In reality, the whole operation had been compromised from the beginning by Allied code-breaking efforts.|$|E
500|$|During {{pre-season}} for 2012–13, Buckle stated that: [...] "'s not in <b>our</b> <b>plans,</b> {{he knows}} that." [...] On 1 August 2012, Boucaud joined League One club Notts County on loan until January 2013. He made his debut for Notts County in a 2–0 home victory over Hartlepool on 21 August 2012, winning {{the man of}} the match award with what was described as an [...] "assured performance... knitting play together well with short, sharp passes". Boucaud scored his first goal for the club in a 2–1 away victory over Coventry City on 20 October 2012, with a shot from 25yards. It was also his first Football League goal in eight years. He signed for Notts County permanently on 10 January 2013 on a one-and-a-half-year contract for an undisclosed fee. Boucaud completed 2012–13 with 43 appearances and one goal for Notts County. However, he fell out of favour under Shaun Derry and was released in May 2014 having made 33 appearances in 2013–14.|$|E

500|$|As the {{popularity}} and marketability {{of the natural}} world rose during the late 19th century, books dedicated to nature came to be in great demand. One reviewer noted in 1901 that [...] "It {{is a part of the}} progress of the day that the Nature study is coming into prominence in our schemes of education, and, beyond these, is entering into <b>our</b> <b>plans</b> for coveted diversion, yet it is a real surprise that so large and increasing a number of each season's publications are devoted to the purpose." [...] Such literature was regularly published in a wide variety of subjects: children's animal books, wilderness novels, nature guides, and travelogues were all immensely popular. The study of nature quickly became part of the public school curriculum, making nature writing increasingly profitable. As the public's hunger for such imaginative works grew, a new genre in which nature was depicted in a compassionate, rather than realistic, light began to take form.|$|E

[...] However, other observers expect the geometrical reduction in scaling, the traditional formulation of Moore's law, may end by around 2025.|$|E

He later complained privately that [...] "all <b>our</b> <b>plans</b> are in tatters".|$|E

2500|$|It {{was clear}} {{early on that}} a larger {{simulator}} was necessary for testing procedures with Skylab ( [...] diameter by [...] high) and other hardware in the pipeline.

Her godmother was Emmanouela Pavlatou, a friend of Melina Mercouri, and the baptismal date was chosen to coincide with Mercouri's birthday. Anastasia's birth was extensively covered by the media. In a Star Channel interview with Eleonora Meleti, Rouvas said: [...] "Marriage is not in <b>our</b> <b>plans.</b> We don't think of it even though it is expected by society based on how we are all raised here in Greece.

[...] In April 1924 the 9th party convention elected her and Maslow co-chairpersons of the Communist Party of Germany. Both criticised by Joseph Stalin, Fischer, intending to defend Maslow (meanwhile arrested for participation in preparing an uprising in Germany planned for 1923), travelled to Moscow arriving there in September 1925 and was held for the following ten months in the Hotel Lux.
