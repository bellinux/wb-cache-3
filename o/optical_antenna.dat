50|$|While {{traditional}} (radio- and microwave) rectennas {{are fundamentally}} similar to optical rectennas, it is vastly more challenging in practice {{to make an}} optical rectenna. One challenge is that light has such a high frequency—hundreds of terahertz for visible light—that only a few types of specialized diodes can switch quickly enough to rectify it. Another challenge is that antennas {{tend to be a}} similar size to a wavelength, so a very tiny <b>optical</b> <b>antenna</b> requires a challenging nanotechnology fabrication process. A third challenge is that, being very small, an <b>optical</b> <b>antenna</b> typically absorbs very little power, and therefore tend to produce a tiny voltage in the diode, which leads to low diode nonlinearity and hence low efficiency. Due to these and other challenges, optical rectennas have so far been restricted to laboratory demonstrations, typically with intense focused laser light producing a tiny but measurable amount of power.|$|E
50|$|The most {{apparent}} advantage optical rectennas have over semiconductor photovoltaics is that rectenna arrays {{can be designed}} to absorb any frequency of light. The resonant frequency of an <b>optical</b> <b>antenna</b> can be selected by varying its length. This is an advantage over semiconductor photovoltaics, because in order to absorb different wavelengths of light, different band gaps are needed. In order to vary the band gap, the semiconductor must be alloyed or a different semiconductor must be used altogether.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>optical</b> <b>antennas</b> in {{physical}} optics is still evolving. Like the antennas {{used in the}} radio frequency (RF) regime, the aspiration of <b>optical</b> <b>antennas</b> is to localize the free propagating radiation energy, and vice versa. For this purpose, <b>optical</b> <b>antennas</b> utilize the distinctive properties of metal nanostructures, which are strong plasmonic coupling elements at the optical regime. The concept of <b>optical</b> <b>antennas</b> is being advanced technologically and they are projected to be substitute devices for detection in the millimeter, infrared, and visible regimes. At present, their potential benefits in light detection, which include polarization dependency, tunability, and quick response times have been successfully demonstrated. <b>Optical</b> <b>antennas</b> also {{can be seen as}} directionally responsive elements for point detectors. This review provides an overview of the historical background of the topic, along with the basic concepts and parameters of <b>optical</b> <b>antennas.</b> One of the major parts of this review covers the use of <b>optical</b> <b>antennas</b> in biosensing, presenting biosensing applications with a broad description using different types of data.

40|$|The {{practical}} application of <b>optical</b> <b>antennas</b> in detection devices strongly {{depends on its}} ability to produce an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio for the given task. It is known that, due to the intrinsic problems arising from its sub-wavelength dimensions, <b>optical</b> <b>antennas</b> produce very small signals. The quality of these signals depends on the involved transduction mechanism. The contribution of different types of noise should be adapted to the transducer and to the signal extraction regime. Once noise is evaluated and measured, the specific detectivity, D*, becomes the parameter of interest when comparing the performance of antenna coupled devices with other detectors. However, this parameter involves some magnitudes that can be defined in several ways for <b>optical</b> <b>antennas.</b> In this contribution we are interested in the evaluation and comparison of D_ values for several bolometric <b>optical</b> <b>antennas</b> working in the infrared and involving two materials. At the same time, some material and geometrical parameters involved in the definition of noise and detectivity will be discussed to analyze the suitability of D_ to properly account for the performance of <b>optical</b> <b>antennas...</b>|$|R
50|$|Idaho National Labs {{used the}} {{following}} steps to fabricate their <b>optical</b> <b>antenna</b> arrays. A metallic ground plane was deposited on a bare silicon wafer, followed by a sputter deposited amorphous silicon layer. The depth of the deposited layer was {{about a quarter of}} a wavelength. A thin manganese film along with a gold frequency selective surface (to filter wanted frequency) was deposited to act as the antenna. Resist was applied and patterned via electron beam lithography. The gold film was selectively etched and the resist was removed.|$|E
50|$|After {{the proof}} of concept was completed, laboratory-scale silicon wafers were {{fabricated}} using standard semiconductor integrated circuit fabrication techniques. E-beam lithography was used to fabricate the arrays of loop antenna metallic structures. The <b>optical</b> <b>antenna</b> consists of three main parts: the ground plane, the optical resonance cavity, and the antenna. The antenna absorbs the electromagnetic wave, the ground plane acts to reflect the light back towards the antenna, and the optical resonance cavity bends and concentrates the light back towards the antenna via the ground plane. This work did not include production of the diode.|$|E
50|$|At MIT in {{the early}} 1960s, Ali Javan started a {{research}} project aimed at extending microwave frequency-measuring techniques into the infrared. He introduced {{the concept of an}} <b>optical</b> <b>antenna</b> of several wavelengths long which enables the near-complete confinement of an incident optical field coupled to it, and forming the antenna in nanoscale. For the first time an antenna was used to receive light and to transmit it to an infinitesimal receiving structure at its tip, observable only with an electron microscope. The antenna responded to infrared laser light and generated current vibrating at the frequencies of the incident beams. It would send electrons streaming into the oxide layer which offers resistance, converting the AC signals to DC and also generating a beat that can be observed electronically. Using this method Javan developed the first absolutely accurate measurement of the speed of light.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Existence of line {{of sight}} (LOS) and perfect {{alignment}} between the communicating modules {{is one of the}} key requirements for free space optical communication. To ensure uninterrupted data flow, auto-aligning transmitter and receiver modules are necessary. We propose a new approach based on spherically shaped transmitter and receiver modules (<b>optical</b> <b>antenna)</b> for maintaining optical links even when the two modules are in relative motion. The spherical <b>optical</b> <b>antenna</b> provides angular diversity in 3 -dimensions, and hence provides a {{line of sight}} at any orientation as long as there are no obstacles between the two communicating modules. To demonstrate the proof-of-concept, we designed and tested an auto-configurable circuit integrated with light sources and detectors placed on spherical surfaces.

40|$|A {{few years}} ago, {{some of the}} authors of the paper {{demonstrated}} the resonance of <b>optical</b> <b>antennas</b> in the visible frequencies.
