5|$|Scientific {{analyses}} of the composition of durian aroma found numerous volatile compounds including esters, ketones, and different sulphur compounds, with no agreement on which may be primarily responsible for the distinctive odour. People in South East Asia with frequent exposures to durian are able to easily distinguish its sweet-like ketones and esters scent from rotten or putrescine odours which are from volatile amines and fatty acids. Developmental or genetic differences in <b>olfactory</b> <b>perception</b> and mapping within the brain (for e.g. anterior piriform cortex to the orbitofrontal cortex) could possibly explain why some individuals are unable to differentiate these smells and find this fruit noxious whereas others find it extremely pleasant and appealing.|$|E

We could describe the flower smell to be close to that of a mixture of methyl mercaptan and propionic acid, by calculation of the dilution index from electronic resistances. In other words, the smell resembled that of “decayed cabbage, garlic and pungent sour” with possible descriptors.

40|$|Animals {{in their}} natural milieu are {{surrounded}} by odors. These odors are rich source of information, and are perceived by sophisticated olfactory systems, that have evolved over time. The sense of smell helps species to localize prey, evade predators, explore food and recognize viable mates. In humans, memoirs, thoughts, emotions, and associations are more readily reached through the sense of smell than through any other channel. This suggests that olfactory processing is imperative and may differ fundamentally from processing in other sensory modalities. The molecular age in olfaction initiated in 1991 with the significant discovery of a large, multigene family of olfactory receptors in rat by Linda Buck and Richard Axel (Buck and Axel, 1991). The first cloned olfactory receptors consisted of a diverse repertoire of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) with seven-trans membrane topology, and they were sparsely expressed in the olfactory epithelium.

5000|$|Early {{scientific}} study of olfaction includes the extensive doctoral dissertation of Eleanor Gamble, published in 1898, which compared olfactory to other stimulus modalities, and implied that smell had a lower intensity discrimination. As the Epicurean and atomistic Roman philosopher Lucretius (1stcentury BCE) speculated, different odors are attributed to different shapes and sizes of [...] "atoms" [...] (odor molecules in the modern understanding) that stimulate the olfactory organ http://www.academia.edu/321004/Lucretius_the_Biochemistry_of_Olfaction_and_Scientific_Discovery. A modern demonstration of that theory was the cloning of olfactory receptor proteins by Linda B. Buck and Richard Axel (who were awarded the Nobel Prize in 2004), and subsequent pairing of odor molecules to specific receptor proteins. Each odor receptor molecule recognizes only a particular molecular feature or class of odor molecules. Mammals have about a thousand genes that code for odor reception. Of the genes that code for odor receptors, only a portion are functional. Humans have far fewer active odor receptor genes than other primates and other mammals. In mammals, each olfactory receptor neuron expresses only one functional odor receptor. Odor receptor nerve cells function like a key-lock system: if the airborne molecules of a certain chemical can fit into the lock, the nerve cell will respond. There are, at present, a number of competing theories regarding the mechanism of odor coding and perception. According to the shape theory, each receptor detects {{a feature of the}} odor molecule. The weak-shape theory, known as the odotope theory, suggests that different receptors detect only small pieces of molecules, and these minimal inputs are combined to form a larger <b>olfactory</b> <b>perception</b> (similar to the way visual perception is built up of smaller, information-poor sensations, combined and refined to create a detailed overall perception). According to a new study, researchers have found that a functional relationship exists between molecular volume of odorants and the olfactory neural response. An alternative theory, the vibration theory proposed by Luca Turin, posits that odor receptors detect the frequencies of vibrations of odor molecules in the infrared range by quantum tunnelling. However, the behavioral predictions of this theory have been called into question. There is no theory yet that explains <b>olfactory</b> <b>perception</b> completely.|$|E

50|$|Olfactory sensory neurons project axons to {{the brain}} within the {{olfactory}} nerve, (cranial nerveI). These nerve fibers, lacking myelin sheaths, pass to the olfactory bulb of the brain through perforations in the cribriform plate, which in turn projects olfactory information to the olfactory cortex and other areas. The axons from the olfactory receptors converge in the outer layer of the olfactory bulb within small (≈50 micrometers in diameter) structures called glomeruli. Mitral cells, located in the inner layer of the olfactory bulb, form synapses with the axons of the sensory neurons within glomeruli and send {{the information about the}} odor {{to other parts of the}} olfactory system, where multiple signals may be processed to form a synthesized <b>olfactory</b> <b>perception.</b> A large degree of convergence occurs, with 25,000 axons synapsing on 25 or so mitral cells, and with each of these mitral cells projecting to multiple glomeruli. Mitral cells also project to periglomerular cells and granular cells that inhibit the mitral cells surrounding it (lateral inhibition). Granular cells also mediate inhibition and excitation of mitral cells through pathways from centrifugal fibers and the anterior olfactory nuclei. Neuromodulators like acetylcholine, serotonin and norepinephrine all send axons to the olfactory bulb and have been implicated in gain modulation, pattern separation, and memory functions, respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Sniffing is a perceptually-relevant behavior, {{defined as}} the active {{sampling}} of odors through the nasal cavity {{for the purpose of}} information acquisition. This behavior, displayed by all terrestrial vertebrates, is typically identified based upon changes in respiratory frequency and/or amplitude, [...] and is often studied in the context of odor guided behaviors and olfactory perceptual tasks. Sniffing is quantified by measuring intra-nasal pressure or flow or air [...] or, while less accurate, through a strain gauge on the chest to measure total respiratory volume. Strategies for sniffing behavior vary depending upon the animal, with small animals (rats, mice, hamsters) displaying sniffing frequencies ranging from 4 to 12 Hz but larger animals (humans) sniffing at much lower frequencies, usually less than 2 Hz. Subserving sniffing behaviors, evidence for an [...] "olfactomotor" [...] circuit in the brain exists, [...] wherein perception or expectation of an odor can trigger brain respiratory center to allow for the modulation of sniffing frequency and amplitude and thus acquisition of odor information. Sniffing is analogous to other stimulus sampling behaviors, including visual saccades, active touch, and whisker movements in small animals (viz., whisking).

50|$|Like {{cognitive}} science, the epidemiology of representations is {{also based}} on the assumption that domain specificity characterizes cognitive abilities or mechanisms. Epidemiology of representations assumes that human animals are cognitively predefined by their evolved neurophysiology (i.e. their cognition is massively modular). However, it also acknowledges that cognitive development plays a functional role for the formation of mental representations, concepts, intuitive theories, and the like.Accordingly, theories in cognitive science argue that humans are evolutionarily equipped with a certain brain-body setup (c.f. common coding theory) that allows them to encode and decode specific kinds of information to their memory via interacting with their environment. This is sensory-specific (i.e. visual-, acoustic-, tactile-, and <b>olfactory</b> <b>perception</b> etc.) and task or reasoning specific (i.e. formulation of intuitive theories). Hence, by these theories, humans are assumed to have (1) an innate cognitive potential that (2) is realized during a natural cognitive development.The reason for the first argument comes from fields like evolutionary anthropology and evolutionary psychology, stating that evolution has been selecting merely those animals that have evolved adaptive mental and neural mechanisms to efficiently cope with specific challenges regarding their environment (e.g. getting food, shelter, mates, etc.). The reason for the second argument comes from cognitive development, stating that animals (especially humans) in their infancy are highly sensitive to input patterns, since their cognitive system automatically and rapidly adapts their environment.|$|E

40|$|<b>Olfactory</b> sensory <b>perception</b> is {{mediated}} by two functionally and anatomically distinct systems in mammals: the main olfactory system, which responds {{to tens of}} thousands of discrete environmental odorants by expressing as many as 1000 receptor genes, and the vomeronasal system, which discriminates between intraspecific chemical signals (pheromones) in order to elicit innate reproductive and social behaviors. The task in gene regulation for the two systems is similar- i. e. to choose one out of many receptor genes for each neuron to express. In a step towards understanding how such regulation may be facilitated at a neuronal level, olfactory receptor genes have been shown to be allelically inactivated (Chess et al., 1994). Here, we wish ask the question of whether VNO genes, like olfactory genes, are also allelically inactivated. Progress has been made towards development of an assay to answer this question.
