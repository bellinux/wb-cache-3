25|$|In the 1980s to the mid-1990s, Japanese animation, like Akira, Dragon Ball, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and Pokémon, made {{a bigger}} {{impact on the}} fan {{experience}} and in the market than manga. Matters changed when translator-entrepreneur Toren Smith founded Studio Proteus in 1986. Smith and Studio Proteus acted as an agent and translator of many Japanese manga, including Masamune Shirow's Appleseed and Kōsuke Fujishima's <b>Oh</b> <b>My</b> Goddess!, for Dark Horse and Eros Comix, {{eliminating the need for}} these publishers to seek their own contacts in Japan.|$|E
25|$|The main cast were {{designed}} by manga artist Kōsuke Fujishima, {{who at the time}} was working on the long-running manga series <b>Oh</b> <b>My</b> Goddess!. Before Fujishima joined the project, the characters had placeholder designs created by Red Company staff. There was resistance from Fujishima's editors due to his heavy work load, including his commitment to <b>Oh</b> <b>My</b> Goddess!. Sakura Wars was the first time Fujishima had ever worked with Sega or been associated with a Sega property, and he was skeptical due to state the project was in when he was first approached, being in a very early stage of development before story or gameplay mechanics had been finalized. Red Company's placeholder character designs were in place {{at a time when it}} was uncertain whether Fujishima would join, but Hiroi was adamant that Fujishima would be character designer. Fujishima eventually joined the project by the end of 1994, with his first design being for Sakura. His initial sketches for Sakura moved Hiroi to tears, and fully convinced both Red Company and Sega that Fujishima was the right person. The positive reception of Fujishima's work, together with his understanding for the project's goals, helped raise staff morale for the entire project.|$|E

25|$|Kyary {{was raised}} in a {{traditional}} strict household, where her parents frequently set early curfews and limited her cell phone access. Her mother was very critical of her fashion sense, to the point where Kyary would have to leave the house dressed normally, and change into Harajuku-style clothing inside a public restroom. She would often return home to find that her mother had disposed of her fashion accessories, which led to further quarrels. She writes in her autobiography, <b>Oh!</b> <b>My</b> God!! Harajuku Girl that her father was more supportive of her, although they had their fair share of quarrels as well.|$|E
