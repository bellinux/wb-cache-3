25|$|Apple {{encouraged}} hardware {{developers to}} produce PCI compatible peripherals {{that could be}} added to the Pippin. The only official method of producing add-ons for the Pippin was by developing PCI-compatible devices, and then placed in a <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> cabinet. A proprietary riser card interface (referred to by Apple as an X-PCI slot) is located on the bottom of a Pippin system, and is used by <b>docking</b> <b>stations.</b> A <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> for a Pippin can contain a variety of hardware, such as SCSI or floppy disk drive controllers, video interfaces, codecs, or network interfaces such as Ethernet. The logic board passes PCI signals through the X-PCI docking interface, and then to the <b>docking</b> <b>station.</b> <b>Docking</b> <b>stations</b> within the Pippin line do not provide pass-through support, thereby limiting a Pippin system to use only one <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> at one time. For example, a <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> for a floppy disk drive would need to be removed in order to attach a <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> for the magneto optical drive. Katz Media produced a generic <b>docking</b> <b>station,</b> containing a PCI slot, allowing a user to install PCI cards. No PCI-based peripherals were ever developed specifically for the Pippin.|$|R

40|$|Keywords- mobile robots, {{wireless}} RF interface, HOLTEK microchip, laser {{range finder}} Abstract—The article develops an auto-charging system for mobile robots, and programs a new docking processing to enhance successful rate. The system contains a <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> and a mobile robot. The <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> contains a <b>docking</b> structure, a limit switch, a charger, two power detection modules and two wireless RF modules. The mobile robot contains a power detection module (voltage and current), an auto-switch, a wireless RF module, a charging connection structure and a laser range finder. The docking structure is designed with one active {{degree of freedom}} and two passive degrees of freedom. The power detection module is controlled by HOLTEK microchip. We calculate the power values using the redundant management method and statistical signal prediction method, and develop an auto-recharging processing using multiple sensors and laser range finder for mobile robots. The processing can enhances the successful rate to guide the mobile robot moving to the <b>docking</b> <b>station.</b> In the experimental results, {{the power of the}} mobile robot is under the threshold value. The mobile robot transmits the charging command to the <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> via wireless RF interface, and searches the landmark of the <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> using laser range finder (SICK). The laser range finder guides the mobile robot approach to the <b>docking</b> <b>station.</b> The mobile robot touches the <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> to trig the power detection device. The <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> supplies the power to the mobile robot by charger, and detects the current and voltage values of the charging processing. The charging current of the <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> is under the threshold value. The <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> turns off the charging current, and trigs the mobile robot leaving the <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> via wireless RF interface...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{evaluate}} how a <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> can be more future proof, environmentally friendly and satisfy the customers’ needs more. The <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> in focus of this project is owned by LVI, and used with one of their cameras MagniLink S. When comparing {{the results of the}} new <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> and the current <b>docking</b> <b>station,</b> the new <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> is more future proof, environmentally friendly and satisfies the customers’ needs more. In the end it is established that following steps should be followed during the development of a docking station: -          Make sure that the cables are reliably fastened into the <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> and that the connectors can handle the docking force. -          Design to use more material with lower environmental impact and ensure that the material fulfils the product requirements and objectives. Use as small amount of material as possible. -          Prioritize the customers’ expressed and unexpressed needs as one of the highest priorities during the development process...|$|R
5000|$|Greenbike is {{a bicycle}} sharing system (differentiated from bicycle rental) within Downtown Salt Lake City {{operated}} by SLC Bike Share (affiliated with B-cycle). The Greenbike program {{is intended for}} short bicycle trips and allows members to pick up any of the available bicycles {{at any of the}} many <b>docking</b> <b>stations</b> and then drop it off at any <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> (does not have to be the same <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> where the bicycle was picked up). Greenbike offers 7-day and annual memberships, but 24-hour passes are also available for non-members. Greenbike members are allowed unlimited short trips, with a trip being defined as the time between when the bicycle is removed from a <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> and when it is returned to a <b>docking</b> <b>station.</b> However bicycles may be kept longer than 30 minutes between dockings for additional charges. In addition, members can start a [...] "new trip" [...] immediately after returning the bicycle to any <b>docking</b> <b>station.</b> The bicycles provided by Greenbike are equipped with GPS traking system that records and provides the member with the miles ridden (and calories burned). Greenbike is seasonal and, depending on weather conditions, shuts down operations in November-December and starts up again in March-April. [...] Other Greenbike <b>docking</b> <b>stations</b> are located near the City Center TRAX, Gallivan Plaza, and Library stations.|$|R
25|$|Mobile <b>docking</b> <b>stations</b> {{usually come}} mated to an armature, laptop desk or {{standard}} rack {{in order to}} provide the ability to position the computer in a vehicle in a safe and ergonomic position. As with all <b>docking</b> <b>stations,</b> a mobile <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> will provide the user with a means to quickly and easily dock and un dock the computer. In addition, some mobile docking-stations provide a security-lock to discourage theft.|$|R
30|$|The BentoBox, {{designed}} {{within the}} project CityLog [21], {{with the participation}} of TNT Express, has been developed {{with the aim of}} resolving the second disadvantage of pack stations. It is composed of a fixed <b>docking</b> <b>station,</b> and six removable modular trolleys. Trolleys are consolidated at the UDC. A new small container has been proposed within the project CityLog to accommodate the trolleys: BentoBox trolleys are loaded into the small container in the UDC and unloaded at the <b>docking</b> <b>station.</b> The unloading of the BentoBox container is again automatic but the BentoBox trolleys should be manually moved from the unloading unit to the <b>docking</b> <b>station.</b> Therefore the unloading time at the <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> is reduced to the minimum and operative costs are minimized. However, as for Pack stations, the number and the localizations of the BentoBox <b>docking</b> <b>stations</b> are fixed for a given urban area and do not depend on the current freight demand.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Docking</b> <b>Station</b> {{added the}} {{possibility}} of interaction between individual player worlds; Norns could 'travel' to other online worlds via a central server, players could chat to other online players, and {{it was possible to}} track Norns (and their offspring) that had been present in their worlds via the <b>Docking</b> <b>Station</b> website. While <b>Docking</b> <b>Station</b> was released late in the series' run, it changed gameplay (and the potential of the series) dramatically. One reviewer stated that it opened up a whole new world for her online. [...] Another reviewer criticised the online portion of the game, as it requires the player to find online buddies. [...] <b>Docking</b> <b>Station</b> also expanded considerably on the game mythos, including the introduction of an 'anti-Shee', the Banshee (a Grendel/Shee hybrid).|$|R

5000|$|Santander Cycles has {{received}} some criticism {{for its use}} of commercial advertising and use of communal <b>docking</b> <b>stations,</b> as well as erroneous charges, bicycle and <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> issues, and lack of coverage for the suburbs. Some users have also found the bikes too heavy and unwieldy, at 23 kilograms (51 lb). The success of the scheme has led to its expansion into other areas of London.
