Due to the rapid increase {{in the size of}} the modern operational systems, it becomes neither practical, nor necessary to load and maintain in the {{data warehouse}} every <b>operational</b> <b>attribute.</b> This paper presents a novel methodology for automated selection of the most relevant independent attributes in a data warehouse. The method is based on the information-theoretic approach to knowledge discovery in databases. Attributes are selected by a stepwise forward procedure aimed at minimizing the uncertainty in the values of key performance indicators (KPI’s). Each selected attribute is assigned a score, expressing its degree of relevance. Using the method does not require any prior expertise in the domain of the data and it can be equally applied to nominal and ordinal attributes. An attribute will be included in a data warehouse schema, if it is found as relevant to at least one KPI. We demonstrate the applicability of the method by reducing the dimensionality of a direct marketing database. ...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to show the economic and environmental benefits that can be attained through the coupling of borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) and combined heat and power (CHP). The subject of this investigation is the University of Massachusetts CHP District Heating System. Energy prices are significantly higher during the winter months due to the limited supply of natural gas. This dearth not only increases operating costs but also emissions, due to the need to burn ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD). The application of a TES system to a CHP plant allows the plant to deviate from the required thermal load in order to operate in a more economically and environmentally optimal manner. TES systems are charged by a heat input when there is excess or inexpensive energy, this heat is then stored and discharged when it is needed. The scope {{of this paper is to}} present a TRNSYS model of a BTES system that is designed using actual operational data from the campus CHP plant. The TRNSYS model predicts that a BTES efficiency of 88 % is reached after 4 years of operation. It is concluded that the application of BTES to CHP enables greater flexibility in the operation of the CHP plant. Such flexibility can allow the system to produce more energy in low demand periods. This <b>operational</b> <b>attribute</b> leads to significantly reduced operating costs and emissions as it enables the replacement of ULSD or liquefied natural gas (LNG) with natural gas...|$|E

Then, three case studies are described: a model of aggregate customer complaint behavior, a model of perceived service quality and a model of customer satisfaction with a specific service encounter.

This paper proposes an innovative mutual funds performance evaluation measure in the context of multicriteria decision making. We implement a multicriteria methodology using stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis, on Greek domestic equity funds for the period 2000 – 2009. Combining a unique dataset of risk-adjusted returns such as Carhart’s alpha with funds’ cost variables,we obtain a multicriteria performance evaluation and ranking of the mutual funds, by means of an additive value function model. The main conclusion is that among employed variables, the sophisticated Carhart’s alpha plays the most important role in determining fund rankings. On the other hand, funds’ rankings are affected only marginally by <b>operational</b> <b>attributes.</b> We believe that our results could have serious implications either in terms of a fund rating system or for constructing optimal combinations of portfolios. ...|$|R

The presence of congestion in both directions during the same daily commute may suggest only a bi-directional, concurrent flow operation (e.g., one dedicated lane operating in each direction) is appropriate. Similarly, the specific <b>operational</b> <b>attributes</b> of how many hours the managed lane is active, where access is applied and who can use it are determined in successive levels of evaluating the observed and forecast operational problems.|$|R

40|$|Skepticism {{about the}} {{longevity}} of conventional agriculture {{has resulted in the}} quest for sustainable agriculture. Like many developing countries, a homogenous definition of the term ‘sustainable agriculture’ is yet to be developed in Malaysia. To fill this gap, using an inclusive perspective, this study posits a refined definition of ‘sustainable agriculture’ for Malaysia. Cognizant of relevant past studies, which were built on rather narrow viewpoints, this study integrates qualitative insights from selected up-stream stakeholders in Malaysian vegetable sector. The structured results suggest that sustainable agriculture can be defined as the process by which an integrative balanced agricultural system is realised through a dynamic set of practices that are (1) environmentally enhancing, (2) resource optimal, (3) economically viable, (4) socially justifiable and (5) functionally feasible over time. Though derived from Malaysia, this definition can be adapted to fit local nuances in other countries and sectoral emphases in agriculture. With these five inter-related <b>operational</b> <b>attributes,</b> which are capable of enhancement and/or modification periodically, this flexible definition can progressively provide potential direction towards academic understanding and development of agricultural sustainability. ...|$|R

Therefore, in 1997 the initiative was taken by the University of Karlskrona/Ronneby to start a network of academic and industrial partners, SARIS, interested in various aspects of software architecture. The intention of the SARIS (Software Architecture Research in Sweden) network is to bring together partners with common interests, exchange experiences through the mailing list and regular meetings and to develop cooperation wherever possible. The term software architecture is somewhat overloaded, but most experts agree that it primarily refers to the top-level decomposition of a system into its main components and the interaction between these components. A second aspect is that software architecture design is primarily concerned with the non-functional requirements (also properties or quality attributes) of software systems, rather than their functionality.
