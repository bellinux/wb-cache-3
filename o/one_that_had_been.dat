5|$|Upon his return, {{he joined}} the staff of Brigadier General George F. Shepley, {{commanding}} the military district of Norfolk. When General Shepley was assigned as Chief of Staff to the XXV Corps commanded by Major General Godfrey Weitzel, de Peyster became an aide to Weitzel, and eventually his Chief of Staff. The unit de Peyster had originally joined, the 13th New York, was also assigned in the XXV Corps. He is credited with raising the first Union flag over the Confederate capitol of Richmond, Virginia after its fall. The flag was the same <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> raised over the city of New Orleans, Louisiana after its fall. Shepley had been the military Governor of New Orleans, and later the State of Louisiana while it flew there.|$|E
5|$|Many {{years after}} the event, the Kentish {{antiquarian}} J. Meadows Cooper related that while sitting in a pub {{on the outskirts of}} Margate on Boxing Day 1855 he had encountered a party carrying a hooden horse that entered the building. Another local resident, Mrs. Edward Tomlin, later related that as a child she had lived at a house named Updown that was near to Margate, and that she remembered the hooden horse visiting them at Christmas time during the 1850s and up until 1865. Maylam's researches also found recollections of a hooden horse which had appeared in Herne and Swalecliffe but which been discontinued in the 1860s, another that was active from Wingate Farm House in Harbledown during the 1850s, and <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> active at Evington but which had ceased by the 1860s. He found another based at Lower Hardres which had been active from at least the least the 1850s under the leadership of Henry Brazier; it was subsequently taken over by his son John, until the tradition ended locally in 1892.|$|E

25|$|A north-south {{route through}} Switzerland had been {{discussed}} {{as far back}} as 1848, and an international conference in Berne in 1869 had decided that the best route would be via the valleys of the rivers Reuss and Ticino, linked by a tunnel under the Gotthard Pass.

25|$|Shortly afterwards, {{police arrested}} Wanderer.

25|$|William and Sarah {{had eight}} children, but {{after her death}} in 1926, {{none of them would}} inherit the farm. Instead, her husband sold the {{property}} to a local developer. By that time the growth of the railroad, and the early development of the county's parkway network had brought suburbanization to northern Westchester. Large farms like the <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in the family for {{a century and a half}} were slowly disappearing, and after the sale the Williams–DuBois farm joined them, subdivided into the smaller, purely residential lots that exist today.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of this ruling, Overland had been denied the {{opportunity}} to cross-examine Mark Safarik, the last prosecution witness and an FBI expert on burglaries, who had testified that the crime scene suggested a staged burglary, as opposed to a real <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> interrupted in progress. Since the prosecution had told the court at a sidebar prior to Safarik's testimony that they intended to limit their questioning to supporting this theory, Perry similarly limited the defense on cross. However, Tickle argued, since Safarik's own report had considered the other burglary, testimony about that should have been allowed.|$|E
25|$|In 1734, as Russia was {{preparing}} for a new war against the Ottoman Empire, an agreement was made between Russia and the Zaporozhian cossacks. Under the Treaty of Lubny, the Zaporozhian Cossacks regained all of their former lands, privileges, laws and customs, in exchange for serving {{under the command of}} a Russian Army stationed in Kiev. A new sich (Nova Sich) was built to replace the <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> destroyed by Peter the Great. Concerned about the possibility of Russian interference in Zaporozhia's internal affairs, the Cossacks began to settle their lands with Ukrainian peasants fleeing serfdom in Polish and Russian proper. By 1762, 33,700 Cossacks and over 150,000 peasants populated Zaporozhia.|$|E
25|$|On February18,1964, J.Armand Bombardier died {{of cancer}} at age56. He left behind a {{thriving}} business, but also <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> focused on one person. Armand dominated his company, overseeing all areas of operation. He controlled the small research department, making all the drawings himself. By {{the time of his}} death sales of the company had reached C$20million, which is the equivalent of C$160million in 2004dollars. The younger generation took over, led by Armand's sons and sons-in-law. The young team reorganized and decentralized the company, adopting modern business tactics. The company adopted the latest technological innovation—the computer—to handle inventory, accounts, and billing. Distribution networks were improved and increased, and an incentive program was developed for sales staff.|$|E

25|$|Theorems {{establishing}} {{the uniqueness of}} the loop representation as defined by Ashtekar et al. (i.e. a certain concrete realization of a Hilbert space and associated operators reproducing the correct loop algebra – the realization that everybody was using) have been given by two groups (Lewandowski, Okolow, Sahlmann and Thiemann; and Christian Fleischhack). Before this result was established it was not known whether there could be other examples of Hilbert spaces with operators invoking the same loop algebra, other realizations, not equivalent to the <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> used so far. These uniqueness theorems imply no others exist and so if LQG does not have the correct semiclassical limit then this would mean the end of the loop representation of quantum gravity altogether.|$|E
25|$|The San Fernando {{earthquake}} {{occurred on}} February 9 at 6:00:41am Pacific Standard Time (14:00:41 UTC) {{with a strong}} ground motion duration of about 12 seconds. The origin of faulting was located five {{miles north of the}} San Fernando Valley. Considerable damage was seen in localized portions of the valley and also {{in the foothills of the}} San Gabriel mountains above the fault block. The fault that was responsible for the movement was not <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> considered a threat, and this highlighted the urgency to identify other similar faults in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The shaking surpassed building code requirements and exceeded what engineers had prepared for, and although most dwellings in the valley had been built in the prior two decades, even modern earthquake-resistant structures sustained serious damage.|$|E
25|$|PATH {{service to}} Lower Manhattan was {{restored}} when a new, $323 million second station opened on November 23, 2003; the inaugural train {{was the same}} <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> used for the evacuation. The second, temporary station contained portions of the original station, but did not have heating or air conditioning systems installed. The temporary entrance was closed on July 1, 2007, and demolished {{to make way for}} the third, permanent station; around the same time, the Church Street entrance opened. On April 11, 2007, the Port Authority announced that it will build a new entrance to the World Trade Center PATH station on Vesey Street. The new entrance opened in March 2008, and the entrance on Church Street has since been demolished. The contract to build the permanent World Trade Center PATH station, according to The Star-Ledger of Newark, was awarded to a joint-venture of Granite Construction North-East (formally Granite Halmar), Fluor Enterprises, Bovis Lend Lease, and Slattery Skanska. Platform A, the first platform of the permanent station, opened February 25, 2014, serving Hoboken-bound riders.|$|E

500|$|Hendrix {{played a}} variety of guitars {{throughout}} his career, but the instrument that became most associated with him was the Fender Stratocaster.

500|$|The idea {{of opening}} an Amtrak {{station in the}} {{vicinity}} of Mitchell Airport is <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> discussed since the mid-1970s. The justification for not building the station at the time was based on infrequent Amtrak service and relatively congestion-free access to the airport from the south by road. By the late 1990s, a station at the airport was proposed as part of the Midwest Regional Rail Initiative. In June 2001, the Wisconsin Department of Transportation authorized $100,000 to start the preliminary design for the station, with an original opening slated for late-2003. Although funding was authorized for preliminary work, funding for actual construction had not been secured.|$|E
500|$|The 5th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron {{based at}} Minot AFB in North Dakota {{maintained}} a detachment of three F-15 Eagles at Loring.

After the detachment left, the Massachusetts Air National Guard's 102nd Fighter Interceptor Wing's 101st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron deployed F-15s to the base, {{the same ones}} {{that were part of}} the 5th.
