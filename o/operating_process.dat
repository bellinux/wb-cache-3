Private local interests owned most of the medium- and small-sized mining operations. More than 250 foreign mining companies have been established in Peru since 1990. Crude oil was transported through 1,754km pipelines, natural gas and natural gas liquids through 983km dual pipelines, and refined products through 13km pipelines. Important mineral industry ports included Callao, Chimbote, Ilo, Matarani, Paita, Puerto Maldonado, Salaverry, San Martin, San Nicolas, and Talara on the Pacific Ocean and Iquitos Pucallpa and yurimaguas on the Amazon River and its tributaries. Peru had an installed electrical generating capacity of 5,050 megawatts (MW), about 80% of which was accounted for by hydroelectric plants. The Peruvian Government raised about $2 billion from the privatization of its electrical sector and committed to an investment of about $20 million to install an additional 1,006 MW of capacity in the immediate future. The energy mix, by source, was hydro (74.5%), fossil fuel (24.5%), and others (1.0%).|$|E

With the load-stress of the bogie frame of an intercity Electric Multiple Unit (Hereinafter referred to as EMU) as the research object, an optimization model of the load-stress transfer relationship is established. The load-stress coefficient for EMU bogie frame was calibrated in the laboratory bench and online test was arranged on Dazhou-Chengdu line. Comparison of nonlinear and linear neural networks proves that the linear transitive relation between the load and stress of the bogie frame in the <b>operating</b> <b>process</b> is highly suitable. An optimization model of the load-stress transfer coefficient is obtained. The data calculated with the modified coefficient are closer to the dynamic stress results in the actual <b>operating</b> <b>process</b> than the data calculated with the calibration coefficient. The coefficient of the modified transitive relation is unaffected by operating area, empty load, heavy load, or other conditions in the <b>operating</b> <b>process</b> of the intercity EMU. The real loads in actual situations are obtained. The model of online load-stress relationship that is highly suitable for line stress calculation is finally established. The research is helpful for further damage calculation and inferring the time history signal of the load in load spectra research.|$|E
