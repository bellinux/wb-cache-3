She began reloading cargo in preparation for deployment and got underway for the Far East on 1 February. Vesuvius reached Subic Bay, via Pearl Harbor and Guam, on 28 February. She then began operations in the South China Sea interrupted by brief returns for the <b>onload</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> in Subic Bay. In July 1965, she received a well-earned respite from her duties in Hong Kong. After a week there, she resumed operations.

40|$|The article {{gives an}} account of the results of working out a {{generalized}} dynamic model <b>of</b> fixation <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> with pads jointly with flexible and thrust elements. Working out a generalized dynamic model <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> fixation is rather a complicated problem not in the sense of solving differential equations systems but in the sense of presenting them as a complex mechanical system “cargo – pads – flexible elements – thrust bars”. Generalized dynamic model <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> with pads observed that this model represents technology of joint work of flexible and thrust fastening means <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> on rolling stock. In particular, {{on the basis of this}} model there can be obtained the technology models of joint work of flexible and elastic fastening means <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> without pads <b>of</b> fastening flexible elements <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> with pads without thrust bars and also flexible fastening elements <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> without pads and thrust bars at asymmetrical and/or symmetrical allocation <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> in the wagon.
