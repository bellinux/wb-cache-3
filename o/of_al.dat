5|$|Following the {{neutralization}} of Ottoman {{naval forces}} in the region, Aretusa {{and the rest of}} the Italian ships then commenced a bombardment campaign against the Turkish ports in the Red Sea before declaring a blockade of the city <b>of</b> <b>Al</b> Hudaydah on 26 January. On 27 July and 12 August, Aretusa, her sister ship Caprera, and Piemonte conducted two bombardments <b>of</b> <b>Al</b> Hudaydah. During the second attack, they destroyed an Ottoman ammunition dump. With the threat of an Ottoman attack greatly reduced, the High Command thereafter began to withdraw forces from the Red Sea Squadron. By the end of August, the unit was reduced to three protected cruisers, Aretusa, Caprera and two auxiliaries. On 14 October, the Ottoman government agreed to sign a peace treaty, ending the war. Aretusas career ended shortly thereafter; the Regia Marina discarded the ship in December and she was subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|A {{coincidental}} upswing in {{the fortunes}} of several studios was publicly explained by Code proponents such as the Motion Picture Herald as proof positive that the code was working. Another fortunate coincidence for Code supporters was the torrent of famous criminals such as John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, and Bonnie and Clyde that were killed by police shortly after the PCA took power. Corpses of the outlaws were shown in newsreels around the country, alongside clips <b>of</b> <b>Al</b> Capone and Machine Gun Kelly in Alcatraz. Among the unarguably positive aspects of the Code being enforced was the money it saved studios in having to edit, cut, and alter films to get approval from the various state boards and censors. The money saved was in the millions annually. A spate of more wholesome family films featuring performers such as Shirley Temple took off.|$|E
5|$|Abdulwahab Hussain {{was also}} a member <b>of</b> <b>Al</b> Wefaq who {{resigned}} in 2005. Unlike Mushaima and al-Singace, Hussain left politics in 2005. He returned in 2009 when he co-founded Al Wafa' opposition group and became its official spokesperson. He played a bigger role in the uprising; he was not arrested when the uprising began nor was he outside the country. Hussain led the first demonstration in the uprising {{in the early hours}} of 14 February. He is also credited with suggesting autonomous action and total decentralization of the protest movement which was adopted by February 14 Youth Coalition, the group behind the call for an uprising in order to avoid getting infiltrated by government.|$|E

He returned to Bahrain in 1973 and was elected to the newly formed parliament. The parliament was dissolved two years later by the Emir, Isa bin Salman al-Khalifa, after it had rejected the State Security Law. In 1977, al-Jamri was appointed as a judge at the High Religious Court of Bahrain. He held the position until 1988, when he was briefly arrested due to his criticism of the government.|$|E

5|$|Crusading was {{a popular}} cause in the 13th century, and in 1248 Louis joined the ill-fated Seventh Crusade, having first made a fresh truce with England and {{received}} assurances from the Pope that he would protect his lands against any attack by Henry. Henry might have joined this crusade himself, but the rivalry between the two kings made this impossible and, after Louis's defeat at the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Al</b> Mansurah in 1250, Henry instead {{announced that he would}} be undertaking his own crusade to the Levant. The King began to make arrangements for passage with friendly rulers around the Levant, imposing efficiency savings on the royal household and arranging for ships and transport: he appeared almost over-eager to take part. Henry's plans reflected his strong religious beliefs, but they also stood to give him additional international credibility when arguing for the return of his possessions in France.|$|E

Under his command were the horsemen <b>of</b> <b>Al</b> Fadl, Al Mira and Banu Kilab among other Syrian tribes. During {{the course of the}} battle, the Mamluk right held firm against the Ilkhanid right's assault and then the Mamluk divisions (excluding Isa's right flank) led a joint counterattack against the Ilkhanid right. It was during this counterattack that Isa's forces mounted a major assault against the Ilkhanid left ending in a rout. Afterward, the Mamluk divisions destroyed the Ilkhanid center and forced the latter's retreat, resulting in a decisive Mamluk victory. Isa was praised in Mamluk histories of the battle for securing the Mamluk victory. In reward for his performance, he was made the lord of Palmyra in late 1281.|$|E

40|$|Approximately {{two decades}} {{have passed since}} the {{description}} of the first gene in the Candida albicans ALS (agglutinin-like sequence) family. Since that time, much has been learned about the composition of the family and the function of its encoded cell-surface glycoproteins. Solution of the structure <b>of</b> the <b>Als</b> adhesive domain provides the opportunity to evaluate the molecular basis for protein function. This review article is formatted as a series of fundamental questions and explores the diversity <b>of</b> the <b>Als</b> proteins, as well as their role in ligand binding, aggregative effects, and attachment to abiotic surfaces. Interaction <b>of</b> <b>Als</b> proteins with each other, their functional equivalence, and the effects of protein abundance on phenotypic conclusions are also examined. Structural features <b>of</b> <b>Als</b> proteins that may facilitate invasive function are considered. Conclusions that are firmly supported by the literature are presented while highlighting areas that require additional investigation to reveal basic features <b>of</b> the <b>Als</b> proteins, their relatedness to each other, and their roles in C. albicans biology...|$|R

5|$|Louis's {{campaign}} against Egypt {{did not go}} well. He successfully captured Damietta, but lost his entire army at the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Al</b> Mansurah, and was himself captured by the Egyptians. His release was eventually negotiated {{in return for a}} ransom (some of which was a loan from the Templars) and the surrender of the city of Damietta. A few years later, in 1252, Louis tried unsuccessfully to ally with the Egyptians, and then in 1253 he sought allies among both the Ismaili Assassins and the Mongols. When he saw a letter from Hethum's brother, the Armenian noble Sempad, which spoke well of the Mongols, Louis dispatched the Franciscan William of Rubruck to the Mongol court. But the Mongol leader Möngke replied with only a letter via William in 1254, asking for the King's submission to Mongol authority.|$|E
