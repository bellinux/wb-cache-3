In other words, the CACB is targeted only to reach minimum 0.0% in the medium term, after having been allowed temporarily to deteriorate throughout the 2008-09 and 2009-10 fiscal years. The CACB figures correspond to the Commission's reported structural budget balance figures, except that it does not include the expenditure [...] "Public sector net investment" [...] and refrains from performing any adjustment for one-off revenues/expenditures. For comparison with the SGP's definition of structural budget balance, it shall be noted that the UK has been forecasted to spend on average 1.5% of GDP annually on [...] "Public sector net investment" [...] throughout the seven years from 2013-14 to 2019-20. When this extra expense is subtracted from the CACB balance, it will be equal to the Commission's [...] "structural budget balance before adjustment for one-off revenues/expenditures". As of 2015, the CACB surplus target and CACB definition has remained unchanged, but its achievement date has now been postponed from its initial set 2015-16 fiscal year to the 2017-18 fiscal year.|$|E

50|$|Rule 55 was an <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> which applied on British {{railways}} in the 19th and 20th centuries, {{and which}} was superseded by the Modular Rulebook following re-privatisation of the railways. Its principle survives: the driver of a train waiting at a signal on a running line must remind the signaller of its presence.|$|E
50|$|Some {{railroad}} operating officials urge {{that both}} GCOR and NORAC {{should be used}} as the SCOR was originally used. They say <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> books should be used as a basic guide to standardizing operating practices, while still preserving the flexibility of individual railroads to either modify or omit rules at their discretion. If standard operating rules are not needed, the major question that remains is whether or not a process has been established for maintaining quality in <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> development. This is especially important with the implementation of constantly changing equipment and train control technology, which will force the need for more rapid rule changes. Therefore, the question that must be asked is whether or not guidelines are needed for the development, writing, testing, application, and representation of operating rules. What kinds of guidelines should be developed, if at all? If necessary, what should be the process for developing those guidelines? For this purpose, a focus group was assembled.|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} to pressures for standardization, the railroads governed by both NORAC and GCOR recently hired consultants to rewrite and reorganize their operating rulebooks. Two major benefits are expected from these new {{versions of the}} <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> book: 1) an improvement in the clarity and understanding of operating rules, and 2) an improvement {{in the ability of}} an employee to look up unfamiliar operating rules.|$|E

40|$|Water grids are {{a diverse}} and {{interconnected}} water supply {{systems that are}} emerging {{in response to the}} pressures of climate variability, climate change, and population growth. Water grid operation is guided by <b>operating</b> <b>rules,</b> which aim to manage supply and demand to meet multiple management criteria such as maximising water security, minimising operational cost, and minimising energy use. However, the diversity and interconnectedness of these water grids increases the number of possible configurations of the <b>operating</b> <b>rules,</b> and combined with uncertainty in forecast conditions, makes find optimal <b>operating</b> <b>rules</b> more challenging. Further, trade-offs between the criteria mean that multiple sets of <b>operating</b> <b>rules</b> can be considered optimal. Thus, this thesis proposes and demonstrates a framework of methods to meet these challenges and identify a set of optimal <b>operating</b> <b>rules</b> to support short-term – 1 to 5 year – operational planning of water grids...|$|R

Amongst Rosner’s achievements was the implementing of a new condensed <b>Operating</b> <b>Rule</b> Book, which eliminated some more complex practices in favour of vastly simplified procedures. Single car roadside freight was resumed where customers required it (discontinued under Australian National) in line with US short line practice.

This is because the population of the Sydney, Illawarra and Blue Mountains areas is forecast to grow by around 1.5 million people by around 2035. Even before then, in any severe drought, the NSW Government and water planning authorities will need to assess whether the current Kurnell plant needs to be doubled in capacity as a matter of urgency. The plant is designed for such contingencies.|$|E
50|$|Within the United States, each {{railroad}} operator formulates its own operating practices, {{subject to}} the regulations in Title 49 Part 236 of the Code of Federal Regulations). However, {{there are two major}} groups of railroads that have adopted common operating practices and therefore a common <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> book. Major railroads on the East Coast have adopted the NORAC rules. Most railroads west of the Mississippi River, as well as the U.S. operations of the Canadian Pacific Railway, use the GCOR. Some large U.S. railroads, including CSX, Norfolk Southern, and the U.S. portion of the Canadian National do not subscribe to either NORAC or CROR and still use their own rule books.|$|E

50|$|From that beginning, {{a system}} of train {{dispatching}} evolved. The <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> book, later standardized for all railroads, contained the basic rules for the operation of trains, such as {{the meaning of the}} all fixed, audible and hand signals; the form, format and meaning of train orders; and the duties and obligations of each class of employee. The operating, or official, timetable established train numbers and schedules; meeting points for those trains; showed the length of passing tracks at each station as well as indicating the locations where train orders might be issued and contained a variety of other information which might be necessary or useful to train crews operating trains over the territory covered.|$|E

40|$|Genetic algorithms, founded {{upon the}} {{principle}} of evolution, are applicable to many optimization problems, especially popular for solving parameter optimization problems. Reservoir <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> curves {{are the most common}} way for guiding and managing the reservoir operation. These rule curves traditionally are derived through intensive simulation techniques. The main aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the efficiency and effectiveness of two genetic algorithms (GAs), i. e., binary coded and real coded, to derive multipurpose reservoir <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> curves. The curves are assumed to be piecewise linear functions where the coordinates of their inflection points are the unknowns and we want to optimize system performance. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed methods are tested on the operation of the Shih-Men reservoir in Taiwan. The current M- 5 operating curves of the Shih-Men reservoir are also evaluated. The results show that the GAs provide an adequate, effective and robust way for searching the rule curves. Both sets of <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> curves obtained from GAs have better performance, in terms of water release deficit and hydropower, than the current M- 5 <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> curves, while the real-coded GA is more efficient than the binary-coded GA.

40|$|SummaryOperating rule curves {{have been}} widely applied to {{reservoir}} operation, due to their ease of implementation. However, these curves excluding ecological requirement are generally derived from observed or synthetic flows and have rarely been determined by future flows under climate change. This paper develops an integrated adaptive optimization model (IAOM) for derivation of multipurpose reservoir <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> curves including ecological <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> curve under future climate change. Steps in the proposed IAOM include: (1) weather generator module to generate feasible future climate conditions, (2) VIC model as the hydrological simulation module to generate streamflows from those future weather conditions, and (3) multipurpose reservoir optimization module to determine the optimal reservoir operations to deal with climate change. China’s Danjiangkou reservoir in Han River basin is selected for a case study. The results demonstrate that the IAOM provides optimal multipurpose reservoir <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> curves that reflect the hydrologic characteristics of future climate change. Ecological supply water operation will alleviate negative effect of dam on river ecosystem without reducing conservation benefits and flood control standard. Therefore, they can consult with reservoir administrators if it is useful results for operations...|$|E
