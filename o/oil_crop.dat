This analysis used descriptive and comparative methods. Bearing in mind the increase of the world prices of <b>oil</b> <b>crops,</b> which is the result of a stronger increase of demand, as well as the importance of the <b>oil</b> <b>crops</b> in Serbia, there are more possibilities for Serbian farmers to enlarge land areas of <b>oil</b> <b>crops</b> in the structure of the agricultural production.

40|$|Mixed <b>cropping</b> {{systems with}} <b>oil</b> <b>crops</b> are of growing {{interest}} in organic farming. They can offer agricultural advances like competition against weeds, support against lodg¬ing and buffering of yield fluctuations. The aim of the cultivation method is to gain additional oil yields for energy or feed purposes. The reported higher land-efficiency-ratios of those mixed cropping systems should lead to higher nutrient requirements. But it is unknown if the different crops just compete for rare soil nutrients or if comple¬mentary effects in mixed cropping systems lead to higher nutrient efficiency. In a field study N-contents in plants and N uptake of diverse mixed cropping systems were compared to sole cropping systems. In linseed (Linum usitatissivum) or false flax (Camelina sativa) in combination with spring wheat (Triticum aestivum) the <b>oil</b> <b>crops</b> showed lower N contents during stem elongation. The N concentrations in wheat tissue were not affected by competition. Wheat was dominating the mixtures. In mix-tures of peas (Pisum sativum) with false flax elevated N concentra¬tions in plant tissue of both component crops were determined. In non-leguminous mixtures with RYT > 1 (spring wheat x false flax), N uptake exceeded the N-require¬ment of the sole crops. In mixtures of legumes with <b>oil</b> <b>crops</b> with RYT > 1 (peas x false flax), the N-uptake of the mixtures was equivalent to or exceeded the N uptake of sole-cropped <b>oil</b> <b>crops...</b>|$|R

40|$|Volatile (essential) <b>oil</b> <b>crops</b> yield a {{wide range}} of products: fresh and dried herbs, oils and oil {{components}} and various oleoresins. Changing lifestyles in developed countries have led to a dramatic increase in demand for these products, particularly over the last decade. More varied use has been made of oils and herbs in cooking, and oil components are now being regarded as safe alternatives to synthetic food additives and crop protection substances. The surge in demand for these products has encouraged a number of temperate and Mediterranean countries to evaluate a range of volatile oil-bearing species as alternative crops. This has resulted in a rapid expansion in the scientific and technical literature on culinary and medicinal herbs.

Most of these are native to the Americas, with 66 species found in the Old World. Plants produce separate male and female flowers. As with many members of the family Euphorbiaceae, Jatropha contains compounds that are highly toxic. Jatropha species have traditionally been used in basketmaking, tanning and dye production.

40|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>crops</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{valuable}} traded agricultural commodities and are probably worth over $ 100 billion/yr. The current volume of traded vegetable oils is over 70 Mt per year and is predicted to increased to over 100 Mt per year by the year 2010 (Murphy 1996). This is probably a considerable underestimate of the total volume of oil production since, particularly in developing countries, most vegetable oils are consumed locally, rather than entering into trading networks. Despite the large volume of globally traded vegetable oil, only four major <b>crops,</b> soybean, <b>oil</b> palm, rapeseed, and sunflower contribute about 75 % of this production. The domination of the oilseed market by the “big four ” <b>oil</b> <b>crops</b> is set to continue for the foreseeable future. Indeed, the establishment of new plantations in South East Asia is predicted to double oil palm production in the next 15 years, making it, by then, the most important source of vegetable oils in the world. The vast majority of vegetable oils are currently used for edible commodities, such as margarines, cooking oils, and processed foods. Only about 15 % of production goes towards the manufacture of oleochemicals, i. e. industrial products derived from <b>oil</b> <b>crops.</b> Over the next few decades two important factors will contribute to an expansion in the markets for both edible and industrial <b>oil</b> <b>crops.</b> Firstly, according to current demographic trends, the global human population will at least double before stabilizing at some time in the mid 21 st century.

40|$|This paper uses a cross {{sectional}} method to analyze irrigation choice and crop choice across 8, 405 farmers in 28 provinces in China. The {{findings show that}} Chinese farmers {{are more likely to}} irrigate when facing lower temperatures and less precipitation. Farmers in warmer places are more likely to choose <b>oil</b> <b>crops,</b> maize, and especially cotton and wheat, and are less likely to choose vegetables, potatoes, sugar, and especially rice and soybeans. In wetter locations, farmers are more likely to choose soybeans, <b>oil</b> <b>crops,</b> sugar, vegetables, cotton, and especially rice, and {{they are less likely to}} choose potatoes, wheat, and especially maize. The analysis of how Chinese farmers have adapted to current climate, provides insight into how they will likely adapt when climate changes. Future climate scenarios will cause farmers in China to want to reduce irrigation and shift toward <b>oil</b> <b>crops,</b> wheat, and especially cotton. In turn, farmers will shift away from potatoes, rice, vegetables, and soybeans. However, adaptation will likely vary greatly from region to region. Policy makers should anticipate that adaptation is important, that the magnitude of changes depends on the climate scenario, and that the desired changes depend on the location of each farm.
