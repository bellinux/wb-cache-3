Sebestyen also praised the book's depiction of Alice, who [...] "speak to me most disquietingly about myself and my generation".

500|$|Millett {{wrote her}} autobiographical books Flying (1974) and Sita (1977) about coming out as gay, partly an {{important}} consciousness-raising activity.

She wrote in Flying what Alice Henry calls in her off <b>our</b> <b>backs</b> review of Sita an [...] "excruciating public and political 'coming out'" [...] and its effect on her personal, political, and artistic lives. While she discussed some of her love affairs in Flying, in Sita she provides insight into a lesbian love affair and her fears of being alone or inadequate. Henry writes, [...] "Kate's transparent vulnerability and attempts to get to the root of herself and grasp her lover are typical of many women who love women." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1997, Gittings and Lahusen {{pushed the}} American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) to grant couple's {{membership}} to them, for a reduced price on health insurance.

On February 18, 2007, Gittings died in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania after a long battle with breast cancer. She is survived by her life partner, Kay Tobin Lahusen, and her sister, Eleanor Gittings Taylor. In 1999, Gittings summed up her inspiration for her activism: [...] "As a teenager, I had to struggle alone to learn about myself and {{what it meant to be}} gay. Now for 48 years I've had the satisfaction of working with other gay people all across the country to get the bigots off <b>our</b> <b>backs,</b> to oil the closet door hinges, to change prejudiced hearts and minds, and to show that gay love is good for us and for the rest of the world too.

"Black Zombie" [...] is an impassioned, self-reflective {{critique}} of problems afflicting the African-American community, including prejudice ("You believe {{when they say}} we ain't shit, we can't grow / All we are is dope dealers and gangstas and hoes"), economic insolvency ("What do we own? The skin on <b>our</b> <b>backs</b> / We rent and we ask for reparations, then they hit us with tax"), and dependency ("I'ma Colombia record slave / So get paid / Control your own destiny, you are a genius / Don't let it happen to you like it did to me, I was a black zombie").

500|$|The {{final year}} of the war—1918—started with {{disaster}} and ended in triumph. On 21 March 1918, General Erich Ludendorff, Chief of the German General Staff, launched the Spring Offensive, which was intended to defeat the Allies on the Western Front before {{the strength of the}} American Expeditionary Force (AEF) could become overwhelming. The main weight of the first blow—Operation Michael—fell on General Gough' s Fifth Army which was forced to retreat. In response to the crisis facing the Allies, French Generalissimo Ferdinand Foch was made Supreme Commander of the Allied forces on the Western Front, placing the BEF under his strategic direction. The next German attack came south of Ypres in the Battle of the Lys river and here too the BEF fell back. Field Marshal Haig issued his famous Order of the Day, [...] "With <b>our</b> <b>backs</b> to the wall and believing in the justice of our cause, each one of us must fight on to the end." [...] A third major German offensive, falling mainly on the French, was finally halted on the Marne in June. On 8 August, General Rawlinson's Fourth Army launched the Battle of Amiens which marked the start of the Hundred Days Offensive, the final Allied offensive on the Western Front. Over the following weeks, all five armies of the BEF went on the offensive from the Somme to Flanders. Fighting continued right up until the Armistice with Germany came into effect at 11:00 am on 11 November 1918.|$|E
