500|$|Although {{the novel}} is an anti-war novel portraying a {{military}} conflict, unusually, it does not describe most of the action, planning, and strategy. Instead, most of the action happens <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>page,</b> and the novel focuses on the decisions being made about {{the conflict in the}} minds of the principal characters. The language used within each chapter shifts with the protagonist, revealing the way they think about the events of the book. Davidson's monologues are filled with the derogatory language he uses; the Athsheans are referred to by the slang term [...] "creechie", the women in the colony are [...] "prime human stock," [...] and so forth.|$|E
500|$|The Baltimore Sun critic, Mary Carole McCauley, {{noted that}} the book was more serious than the {{previous}} novels in the series and had more straightforward prose. Furthermore, reviewer Alice Fordham from The Times wrote that [...] "Rowling's genius is not just her total realisation of a fantasy world, but the quieter skill of creating characters that bounce <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>page,</b> real and flawed and brave and lovable". Fordham concluded, [...] "We have been a long way together, and neither Rowling nor Harry let us down in the end". The New York Times writer Michiko Kakutani agreed, praising Rowling's ability to make Harry both a hero and a character that can be related to.|$|E
500|$|Manga critic Jason Thompson {{declared}} Toriyama's art influential, {{saying that}} his [...] "extremely personal and recognizable style" [...] was a reason for Dragon Balls popularity. He {{points out that the}} popular shōnen manga of the late 1980s and early 1990s had [...] "manly" [...] heroes, such as City Hunter and Fist of the North Star, whereas Dragon Ball starred the cartoonish and small Goku, thus starting a trend that Thompson says continues to this day. Toriyama himself said he went against the normal convention that the strongest characters should be the largest in terms of physical size, designing many of the series' most powerful characters with small statures. Thompson concluded his analysis by saying that only Akira Toriyama drew like this at the time and that Dragon Ball is [...] "an action manga drawn by a gag manga artist." [...] However, James S. Yadao, author of The Rough Guide to Manga, points out that an art shift does occur in the series, as the characters gradually [...] "lose the rounded, innocent look that [...] established in Dr. Slump and gain sharper angles that leap <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>page</b> with their energy and intensity." ...|$|E

500|$|Manga critic Jason Thompson {{stated in}} 2011 that [...] "Dragon Ball {{is by far}} the most {{influential}} shonen manga of the last 30 years, and today, almost every Shonen Jump artist lists it as one of their favorites and lifts from it in various ways." [...] He says the series [...] "turns from a gag/adventure manga to an nearly-pure fighting manga", and its basic formula of [...] "lots of martial arts, lots of training sequences, a few jokes" [...] became the model for other shōnen series, such as Naruto. Thompson also called Toriyama's art influential and cited it as a reason for the series' popularity. James S. Yadao, author of The Rough Guide to Manga, claims that the first several chapters of Dragon Ball [...] "play out much like Saiyuki with Dr. Slump-like humour built in" [...] and that Dr. Slump, Toriyama's previous manga, has a clear early influence on the series. He feels the series [...] "established its unique identity" [...] after the first occasion when Goku's group disbands and he trains under Kame-sen'nin, when the story develops [...] "a far more action-packed, sinister tone" [...] with [...] "wilder" [...] battles with aerial and spiritual elements and an increased death count, while humor still makes an occasional appearance. Yadao claims that an art shift occurs when the characters [...] "lose the rounded, innocent look that he established in Dr. Slump and gain sharper angles that leap <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>page</b> with their energy and intensity." ...|$|E

The Washington Post called it [...] "amazing" [...] and [...] "dazzlingly accomplished" [...] and The Oregonian said the novel [...] "boldly creates a new voice from the Old West." [...] The New York Times was equally effusive: [...] "The miracle of the novel is that it obliges us to rethink our whole idea of narration and history and myth." [...] The Los Angeles Times found it [...] "brave, original, ribald, funny, [...] heart-rending" [...] and concluded that the book is [...] "as bright as it is dark, full of fictional and philosophical pleasures, a quirky, unsettling look at American history and a vision quest in the grand old tradition." [...] The book's extensive cast of quirky characters was singled out by several reviewers. The Washington Post said the characters were [...] "winningly rebellious...brimming with life", while the Seattle Post-Intelligencer said [...] "Spanbauer has populated his pages with characters so colorfully drawn they practically pop <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>page</b> and start dancing, egged on by mass consumption of whiskey, locoweed and opium stardust." [...] Reviewers compared Spanbauer to Mark Twain, D. H. Lawrence, Gabriel García Márquez, Garrison Keillor, Thomas Berger, Walt Whitman, William H. Gass, Molly Gloss, and Russell Hoban.|$|E

But on the day I speak of, it was no wonder that he got perplexed, for he was reading a mysterious passage in the Book of Chronicles. Being aware that I knew how to read, he called me as I was passing his premises, and read the passage over, demanding an explanation. I told him it was a mystery that no one could explain; not even a parson. But this did not satisfy him, and I left him poring over it still.|$|E

50|$|It was {{not until}} the late 1950s that a portable, {{reliable}} and convenient device would be developed as a tool for increasing reading speed. Evelyn Wood, a researcher and schoolteacher, was committed to understanding why some people were naturally faster at reading and tried to force herself to read very quickly. In 1958, while brushing <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> of a book she had thrown down in despair, she discovered that the sweeping motion of her hand across <b>the</b> <b>page</b> caught <b>the</b> attention of her eyes, and helped them move more smoothly across <b>the</b> <b>page.</b> She then used the hand as a pacer. Wood first taught the method at the University of Utah, before launching it to the public as Evelyn Wood's Reading Dynamics in Washington, D.C. in 1959.|$|R
