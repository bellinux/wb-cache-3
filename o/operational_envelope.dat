40|$|Abstract. This paper covers {{exploratory}} {{efforts that}} attempt to address limitations and restrictions in the operating envelope of UAVs, and proposes a conceptual solution to the problem. UAVs, like aircraft, can be categorized into two main types: fixed wing and rotary wing. A fixed wing UAV flies using wings that generate lift caused by the vehicle’s forward airspeed and {{the shape of the}} wings. The greatest advantage of fixed wing UAVs obtained from utilizing aerodynamic lift is its long range and high endurance performance. However, this primary advantage {{comes from the fact that}} most fixed wing UAVs have wings that are of a high aspect ratio, which becomes a liability in confined operating conditions. An autonomous aerial hard docking system is proposed as a system that manages to enable different UAV platforms to have <b>operational</b> <b>envelopes</b> which far exceed the <b>operational</b> <b>envelopes</b> of the constituent UAV platforms. The paper outlines necessary subsystems that need to exist for autonomous aerial hard docking capability. It presents practical requirements of the various constituent subsystems, namely the guidance and navigation subsystem, the grasping subsystem and the damping subsystem. For each of the subsystems, the challenges which have to be overcome to ensure the effectiveness of the complete system are examined. It further elaborates the testing, investigation and development steps that need to be implemented to realize this capability. It ends by elaborating on the work already underway and future development plans.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. This thesis develops {{a suite of}} automated techniques aimed at analyzing the characteristics of arrays of control moment gyroscopes (CMGs) and/or reaction wheels (RWs). Three specific areas, relevant {{to the design of}} new spacecraft, are examined: momentum space, torque space, and reaction forces. The momentum space analysis creates a maximum saturation envelope for both pure CMG/RW arrays and for hybrid arrays. The torque space analysis creates a maximum envelope for RWs and presents the idea of state-space analysis for CMGs, which leads to the ability to determine singularity free <b>operational</b> <b>envelopes.</b> These envelopes allow satellite slew performance to be estimated, allowing for an initial determination of component size. The reaction forces and moments seen at the attachment points of the RWs and CMGs during maneuvers is also analyzed.

The proposed method {{is based on the}} thermal signature of the face. It measures physiological function from a stand-off distance and therefore, it can unobtrusively monitor a machine operator. The method was tested on 11 participants. The results show that multi-tasking ele-vates metabolism in the supraorbital area, which is an indirect indication of in-creased mental load. This local metabolic change alters heat dissipation and thus, it can be measured through thermal imaging. The methodology could serve as a benchmarking tool in scenarios where an operator’s divided attention may cause harmful outcomes. A classic example is the case of a vehicle driver who talks on the cell phone.

40|$|Aircraft {{structures}} {{are designed to}} guarantee safety of flight in some required <b>operational</b> <b>envelope.</b> When the aircraft becomes structurally impaired, safety of flight may not be guaranteed within that previously safe <b>operational</b> <b>envelope.</b> In this case the safe <b>operational</b> <b>envelope</b> must be redefined in-flight and a means to prevent excursion from this new envelope must be implemented. A specific structural failure mode that {{may result in a}} reduced safe operating envelope, the exceedance of which could lead to catastrophic structural failure of the aircraft, will be addressed. The goal of the DFEAP program is the detection of this failure mode coupled with flight controls adaptation to limit critical loads in the damaged aircraft structure. The DFEAP program is working with an F/A- 18 aircraft model. The composite wing skins are bonded to metallic spars in the wing substructure. Over time, it is possible that this bonding can deteriorate due to fatigue. In this case, the ability of the wing spar to transfer loading between the wing skins is reduced. This failure mode can translate to a reduced allowable compressive strain on the wing skin and could lead to catastrophic wing buckling if load limiting of the wing structure is not applied. The DFEAP program will make use of a simplified wing strain model for the healthy aircraft. The outputs of this model will be compared in real-time to onboard strain measurements at several locations on the aircraft wing. A damage condition is declared at a given location when the strain measurements differ sufficiently from the strain model. Parameter identification of the damaged structure wing strain parameters will be employed to provide load limiting control adaptation for the aircraft. This paper will discuss the simplified strain models used in the implementation and their interaction with the strain sensor measurements. Also discussed will be the damage detection and identification schemes employed and the means by which the damaged aircraft parameters will be used to provide load limiting that keeps the aircraft within the safe <b>operational</b> <b>envelope...</b>|$|E

Health problems due to exposure to vibration and shock are common among the crew operating high speed craft (HSC). Whole body vibration and repeated shocks have been identified as one of the major causes for health effects among HSC crew. Whole body vibration can affect health, comfort and performance depending on the magnitude, waveform and time of exposure.
