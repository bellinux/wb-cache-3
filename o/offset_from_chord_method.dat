Our method provides a coherent and relevant probabilistic framework for template-based transcription. The only information {{needed for the}} transcription {{is the definition of}} the chords: in particular neither annotated audio data nor music theory knowledge is required. We extract from the signal a succession of chroma vectors which are our model observations. We propose a generative model for these observations <b>from</b> <b>chord</b> distribution probabilities and fixed chord templates. The parameters are evaluated through an EM algorithm. In order to capture the temporal structure, we apply some post-processing filtering methods before detecting the <b>chords.</b> Our <b>method</b> is evaluated on two audio corpus. Results show that our <b>method</b> outperforms state-of-the-art <b>chord</b> recognition <b>methods</b> and also gives more relevant chord transcriptions. I...|$|R
40|$|Some {{numerical}} schemes, {{based upon}} Newton's and <b>chord</b> <b>methods,</b> for the computations of the perturbed bifurcation points {{as well as}} the solution curves through them, are presented. The Ã‚Â“initialÃ‚Â” guesses for Newton's and <b>chord</b> <b>methods</b> are obtained using the local analysis techniques and proved to fall into the neighborhoods of contraction for these methods. In applications the Ã‚Â“perturbationÃ‚Â” parameter represents a physical quantity and it is desirable to use it to parameterize the solution curves near the perturbed bifurcation point. In this regard, it is shown that, for certain classes of the perturbed bifurcation problems, Newton's and <b>chord</b> <b>methods</b> can be used to follow the solution curves in a neighborhood of the perturbed bifurcation point while the perturbation parameter is kept fixed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{extension}} {{of a novel}} optimization approach for the determination of accessible output sets of planar manipulators is presented. The optimization approach provides a general method for the determination of workspaces and has the advantage that it allows for the easy and systematic implementation of constraints acting on manipulators. The previously proposed optimization methodologies, the ray method and modified ray method, were unable to map the boundaries of nonconvex planar workspaces automatically. A new <b>chord</b> <b>method</b> is proposed in this paper, which allows for the efficient and automated mapping of most nonconvex workspaces. The <b>chord</b> <b>method</b> is illustrated by application to three degree of freedom planar parallel manipulators of varied geometry. In particular, as an extreme test and illustration of its capability, the <b>chord</b> <b>method</b> is also applied to manipulators exhibiting redundant behavior...|$|R
40|$|The {{statistical}} {{precision of}} a <b>chord</b> <b>method</b> for estimating fractal dimension from a correlation integral is derived. The optimal chord length is determined, and a comparison {{is made to}} other estimators. These calculations use the approximation that all pairwise distances between the points are statistically independent; the adequacy of this approximation is assessed numerically. The <b>chord</b> <b>method</b> provides a very quick and easy dimension estimate which is only slightly less precise than the optimal estimator.

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of strength, stereological and fractographical tests and examinations carried out on concretes made based on two coarse aggregates: basalt and gravel types. A relationship was demonstrated to exist between the strength characteristics of concretes and the fractal dimension, as determined by the <b>chord</b> <b>method.</b> The concrete of poorer strength properties had higher fractal dimension values of its fractures, whereas the concrete of the best strength parameters was characterized by the lowest fractal dimension value. A relationship was found between the stereological parameters (the mortar fraction, VVmor, the coarse aggregate relative area, SVC, and the air pore relative area, SVP) and the fracture surface morphology described by the fractal dimension, as determined by the <b>chord</b> <b>method,</b> DC...|$|R
