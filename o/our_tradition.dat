25|$|In 2009, the Buzz {{continued}} its practice of passing on drafting a marquee player. Despite being the defending WTT champions, the Buzz did not protect {{any of their}} players from the previous year's team. Instead, it drafted four new players in the roster draft and put together the youngest team in WTT history. In the order selected, the players drafted by the Buzz and their ages {{at the time were}} Sloane Stephens, 16, Christina McHale, 16, Evan King, 17, and Alex Domijan, 17. Roger Smith, who played for the OTBzz in their inaugural 1995 season was named the new Buzz coach. After the roster draft, Buzz owner Nitty Singh said, “We are extremely excited to showcase America’s finest juniors on our New York Buzz team this season. This keeps with <b>our</b> <b>tradition</b> of presenting the game’s future stars such as Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras and Lindsay Davenport who also played tournaments here in the Capital Region during the early part of their careers.” With three of their four regular full-time players having other commitments during the season, none of them other than Domijan were able to play in every match. The Buzz ended up using 13 different players in 2009, all of which were young amateurs. The optimism {{at the outset of the}} season evolved into the chaos of a rotating door through which players came and went resulting in a record for the Buzz of 4 wins and 10 losses, fourth in the Eastern Conference and barely avoided a last place finish by winning a standings tiebreaker over the Philadelphia Freedoms.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the First World War, Rangers did {{not have}} any policy {{regarding}} religion dictating if they could be signed or not. Prior to the war, Rangers did have a number of Catholic players. [...] In the 1920s, following the rise in popularity of the Orange Order in Glasgow where Rangers players and directors attended functions, [...] Rangers quietly introduced an unwritten rule that the club would not sign any player or employ any staff member who was openly Catholic. The policy was kept a secret within Rangers until 1965 when Ralph Brand revealed to the News of the World that Rangers operated a Protestants-only policy when he left them for Manchester City. [...] Two years later vice-chairman Matt Taylor was asked about perceived anti-Catholicism with the [...] "No Catholic" [...] signing policy at Rangers, he stated [...] " [...] part of <b>our</b> <b>tradition...</b> we were formed in 1873 as a Protestant boys club. To change now would lose us considerable support". The policy was mirrored by Northern Irish club Linfield, who shares a similar club culture to Rangers, up until the 1980s as a contrast to their Big Two rivals Glentoran though it was not as strict as Rangers'. Some Catholic players did play for Rangers during this time despite the policy with Don Kitchenbrand keeping his Catholicism secret and Laurie Blyth, who left the club after his Catholic faith was discovered. There were also claims by some former Rangers players that the policy extended to non-Catholic players who married Catholics. However the former Rangers player and Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, himself married to a Catholic, confirmed that marriage to a Catholic was {{not a part of the}} signing policy to exclude players.|$|E

2500|$|.....One of {{the most}} well known ways <b>our</b> <b>tradition</b> {{has been able to}} hold onto both the {{scientific}} theory of evolution as well as the concept of a purposeful creation was by reading the creation story in Genesis in a more allegorical sense. One famous medieval commentary proclaims that the days of creation, as outlined in the book of Bereshit, could be seen as representative of the stages of creation and not literal 24 hour periods. Thus each Biblical day could have accounted for thousands or even millions of years. In that way the progression according to both evolution and the Torah remains essentially the same: first the elements were created, then the waters, the plants, the animals, and finally us. Therefore, Genesis and Darwin can both be right in a factual analysis even while we acknowledge that our attitudes towards these shared facts are shaped much more strongly by the Torah – we agree how the process unfolded but disagree that it was random.|$|E
