5|$|Joe Bangs {{finds himself}} unable {{to have the}} case dropped, but Bletcher still feels that Black's pursuit <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> end up costing her her job. However, Black knows she is {{doing the right thing}} and is {{determined}} to continue. Her fears for Sara are confirmed when it is discovered she and the elder Bangs have gone missing. Frank, an offender profiler, deduces that Bangs' controlling personality would cause him to take his daughter somewhere he knows, and realizes that they will be in the family's holiday cabin in the woods. A police manhunt begins, and Bangs is arrested without Sara coming to harm.|$|E
5|$|No {{music that}} can be {{definitively}} traced to Nero has been identified, although Handel scholars have speculated that some <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> {{have been used in}} later works, particularly Agrippina which has a related storyline and some of the same characters. Fragments of music from Florindo and Daphne have been preserved, although without the vocal parts, and some of these elements have been incorporated into an orchestral suite first recorded in 2012.|$|E

5|$|The Gordano Valley {{west of the}} Port of Bristol {{stretches}} {{past the}} coastal towns of Portishead and Clevedon.

The Chew Valley is another managed water way and woodland in the same area. The Avon Valley to the East of Bristol continues to Bath and beyond towards Wiltshire. The western end of the Mendip Hills has, since 1972, been designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. The Blackdown Hills were designated an AONB in 1991, and the Quantock Hills have held the status since 1956, the first such designation in England under the Act.|$|E

25|$|A pseudotriangulation is a {{partition}} {{of a region}} of the plane into pseudotriangles. Any triangulation of a region of the plane is a pseudotriangulation. While any two triangulations of the same region must have the same numbers of edges and triangles, the same is not true of pseudotriangulations; for instance, if the region is itself an n-vertex polygonal pseudotriangle, then a pseudotriangulation <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have as few as one pseudotriangle and n edges, or as many as n − 2 pseudotriangles and 2n − 3 edges.|$|E

25|$|Although the Vendidad {{is not a}} liturgical manual, {{a section}} <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be recited {{as part of a}} greater Yasna service. Although such {{extended}} Yasnas appears to have been frequently performed in the mid-18th century (as noted in Anquetil-Duperron's observations), it is very rarely performed at the present day. In such an extended service, Visparad 12 and Vendidad 1-4 are inserted between Yasna 27 and 28. The Vendidad ceremony is always performed between nightfall and dawn, though a normal Yasna is performed between dawn and noon.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle wrote a work On the Pythagoreans, {{which is}} no longer extant. Some <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be {{available}} in the Protrepticus. Aristotle's disciples Dicaearchus, Aristoxenus, and Heraclides Ponticus also wrote on the same subject. These writers were among the best sources from whom Porphyry and Iamblichus drew, while still adding some legendary accounts and their own inventions to the mix. Hence, historians are often reduced to considering the statements based on their inherent probability, but even then, if all the credible stories concerning Pythagoras were supposed true, his range of activity would be impossibly vast.|$|E
25|$|The {{mesoderm}} {{around the}} tubules becomes condensed {{to form the}} connective tissue of the kidney. The ureter opens at first into the hind-end of the Wolffian duct; after the sixth week it separates from the Wolffian duct, and opens independently into {{the part of the}} cloaca which ultimately becomes the urinary bladder. The renal tubules become arranged into renal pyramids, and the lobulated condition of the kidneys exists for some time after birth, while traces <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be found even in the adult. The kidney of the ox and many other animals, on the other hand, remains lobulated throughout life.|$|E

25|$|The {{thickness}} of the wall should, in my opinion, be such that armed men meeting on top <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> pass one another without interference. In the thickness there should be set a very close succession of ties made of charred olive wood, binding the two faces of the wall together like pins, to give it lasting endurance. For that is a material which neither decay, nor the weather, nor time can harm, but even though buried in the earth or set in the water it keeps sound and useful forever. And so not only city walls but substructures in general and all walls that require a thickness {{like that of a}} city wall, will be long in falling to decay if tied in this manner.|$|E
25|$|Oxytocin {{produces}} antidepressant-like {{effects in}} animal models of depression, and a deficit <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> {{be involved in}} the pathophysiology of depression in humans. The antidepressant-like effects of oxytocin are not blocked by a selective antagonist of the oxytocin receptor, suggesting that these effects are not mediated by the oxytocin receptor. In accordance, unlike oxytocin, the selective non-peptide oxytocin receptor agonist WAY-267,464 does not produce antidepressant-like effects, at least in the tail suspension test. In contrast to WAY-267,464, carbetocin, a close analogue of oxytocin and peptide oxytocin receptor agonist, notably does produce antidepressant-like effects in animals. As such, the antidepressant-like effects of oxytocin may be mediated by modulation of a different target, perhaps the vasopressin V1A receptor where oxytocin is known to weakly bind as an agonist.|$|E
25|$|Before Roman {{times the}} area today known as Surrey was {{probably}} largely {{occupied by the}} Atrebates tribe, centred at Calleva Atrebatum (Silchester), in the modern county of Hampshire, but eastern parts <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have been held by the Cantiaci, based largely in Kent. The Atrebates {{are known to have}} controlled the southern bank of the Thames from Roman texts describing the tribal relations between them and the powerful Catuvellauni on the north bank. In about AD 42 King Cunobelinus (in Welsh legend Cynfelin ap Tegfan) of the Catuvellauni died and war broke out between his sons and King Verica of the Atrebates. The Atrebates were defeated, their capital captured and their lands made subject to Togodumnus, king of the Catuvellauni, ruling from Camulodunum (Colchester). Verica fled to Gaul and appealed for Roman aid. The Atrebates were allied with Rome during their invasion of Britain in AD 43.|$|E
