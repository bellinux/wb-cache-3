First, s 35(5) only becomes applicable once it has been established that evidence has been unconstitutionally <b>obtained.</b> <b>In</b> <b>respect</b> <b>of</b> {{the right to remain}} silent, it first needs to be established whether the right to remain silent in s 35(1)(a) or s 35(3)(h) has been infringed. The right to remain silent attaches only to arrested and accused persons and does not embrace the rights of the victim and society at large. The broader notion of trial fairness may possibly be read into s 35(5) but is precluded at any earlier stage of the inquiry. Secondly, by conflating the right to silence and the right to a fair trial at all stages, Yacoob J implies that the only remedy for infringing the right to remain silent is the exclusion of evidence. An arrested person who is subjected to improper police questioning that infringes her right to remain silent must surely (at least theoretically) be able to seek relief for the infringement of this pre-trial right prior to going to trial. Undue emphasis on trial fairness may result in insufficient attention being given to the underlying relationship between the right to remain silent and the right to dignity.|$|E

There must be some causal connection between the circumstances which give rise to the claim for rescission and the judgment.

40|$|The {{article is}} {{a brief review of}} the {{research}} of the stress-deformation state of a structure that represents a hemispherical geodetic dome exposed to the dead load. Single-contour geodetic domes composed of flat plates are the subject of the research. The process of their design has two stages: (a) design of geometric models of geodetic domes and (b) analysis of domes. The authors demonstrate that the first stage can be implemented through the employment of the library of ArchiCAD objects. Supplementary research is needed to have the second stage implemented. The objective of this research is to present the results of the research using computer-aided methods of modeling of metal structures. The analysis of smooth hemispherical domes is performed using analytical and finite-element methods within the Patran/Nastran environment. The authors demonstrate that the results of the finite-element method analysis converge with the results of the analytical method analysis. Conversion of geometric models of geodetic domes into the format that satisfies Patran preprocessor requires the employment of the Visual Basic software. Ultimately, comparison between the results <b>obtained</b> <b>in</b> <b>respect</b> <b>of</b> the geodetic dome and the analytical results <b>obtained</b> <b>in</b> <b>respect</b> <b>of</b> the smooth dome exposed to the dead load is performed. The conclusion is that the maximal stress experienced by a single-contour geodetic dome, in the event of reduction of sizes of plates, converges with the maximal stress of similar smooth domes.
