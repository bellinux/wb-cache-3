Failing to reach a settlement with Guest, Krantz told Bakshi to grab the series' model sheets and return to the United States. When the studio found out, a warrant for Bakshi's arrest was issued by the Toronto police. He narrowly avoided capture before being stopped by an American border guard who asked him what he was doing. Bakshi responded, [...] "All <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> are heading into Canada to dodge the draft and I'm running back into the States. What the fuck is wrong with that!?" [...] The guard laughed, and let Bakshi through. Vita was detained at the airport; he was searched and interrogated for six hours.|$|E

Nobody knows what went on inside <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> and for them to stick together and to play like they played tonight, and like they have tried in every game, it says a lot about them." [...] Defensive end Ryan Van Bergen, who recorded 2.5 sacks, three tackles for loss and seven tackles overall, was named the Big Ten's Co-Defensive Player of the Week. Toussaint's 65-yard touchdown run and his total of 192 rushing yards were career highs.|$|E

Payne comments on their work together on the album Astral Weeks, which also included musicians Connie Kay, Warren Smith, Jay Berliner, and Richard Davis: [...] "Ironically, the image you have {{when you listen to}} the album now is <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> who are all together, and they realise they are creating a monumental work of art. The fact is that it was just another session for them." [...] Payne states of his observations of Van Morrison's performance style: [...] "When (Van) was on stage, he would look like a space cadet, but then he'd open his mouth and you would realize that he had channeled everything into the sound of his voice. The rest of it was just a shell that was there for the purpose of producing this noise." ...|$|E

500|$|Washington Post {{journalist}} Erik Wemple {{criticized the}} story's graphic {{details of the}} alleged crime and {{said that it was}} hard to believe due to the [...] "diabolical" [...] description. A number of commentators accused the magazine of setting rape victims [...] "back decades", while The Washington Post described the Rolling Stone story as a [...] "catastrophe for journalism". Natasha Vargas-Cooper, a columnist at The Intercept, said that Erdely's decision not to interview the accused fraternity members showed [...] "a horrendous, hidden bias ... the premise that none <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> would tell the truth if asked", while a staff editorial in The Wall Street Journal charged that [...] "Ms. Erdely did not construct a story based on facts, but went looking for facts to fit her theory." [...] Lauren Kling of the Poynter Institute criticized Rolling Stone for [...] "blaming [...] source" [...] instead of taking ownership of their own errors. Anna Merlan, a writer for Jezebel, who had earlier called Reason columnist Robby Soave an [...] "idiot" [...] for expressing skepticism of the Rolling Stone story, declared: [...] "I was dead fucking wrong, and for that I sincerely apologize."

500|$|A {{scientist}} {{studying the}} Kaiju. Day stated: [...] "Certainly myself and Burn Gorman provide {{a little bit}} of much needed levity, it's a break from the monsters and the guys fighting. But then the character gets thrust into the story in a way that his life is seriously at risk and it becomes a little more action oriented and a little more horror movie-esque. So, he kinda bounces back between being humorous and also being real… the rest <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys,</b> they look really good in their suits and they've got abs, they can kick and fight and punch. Newt is sort of the 'everyman' and he's flawed and he's arrogant." [...] Del Toro gave Geiszler the mentality of a celebrity chef, with tattoos and a [...] "big personality". According to the director, Day was cast based on his performance in an episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia: [...] "He comes out with a stick, and he has a monologue about what it is to hunt the rats in the basement. It was very funny, but he was coming from character. He was not doing big stuff, he was, like, really mourning and lamenting his job, you know, how inhuman it is. And I thought, 'This guy is great at shading and comedy.' There are moments in the movie where he delivers them both." [...] Trek Buccino portrays Geiszler as a child.|$|E
500|$|Pierre {{characterized}} Hoppus as both [...] "very {{involved and}} not involved," [...] with {{his job as}} producer mainly giving notes on {{the sound of the}} instruments and offering suggestions to improve songs. Hoppus mostly worked with the band on arrangements, believing the songs were too packed and [...] "needed to breathe". Hoppus mentioned that label politics had hindered the creativity of Blink's Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001), {{and did not want to}} see the same fate befall the band. He was [...] "meticulous" [...] in his approach, partially due to the fact that it was his first production job. Hoppus was the one who advised the band to merge two previously unrelated songs—a slower, softer song and a pulsating drum track—into one, which became [...] "Time Turned Fragile". The frontman of Fall Out Boy, Patrick Stump, contributed guest vocals to [...] "Everything Is Alright", and Hoppus to [...] "Hangman". With production completed, Hoppus was very excited for the band that he felt was on the cusp of [...] "great things", recalling, [...] "After six weeks <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> living all together in two rooms of this house with a studio attached they created this amazingly beautiful and honest album. Justin's lyrics are so brutally truthful." [...] The group completed recording in November 2004, and judged final mixes over the interim months. Pierre later called Commit This to Memory his personal favorite album by the band.|$|E

On a few different occasions, Tumatoe barely avoided physical altercations initiated by drunken quarterbacks or angry coaches. Says Tumatoe, “I think people miss a basic thing about the blues, and I don’t understand why they don’t get it. Blues is a light-hearted music. They’re stories that make fun of what goes on in your life. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a football fan. I enjoy these games. I watch them all.
