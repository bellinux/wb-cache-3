50|$|Hippolytus of Rome was {{a disciple}} of Irenaeus, a disciple of Polycarp, a disciple of Apostle John. Hippolytus's works were {{considered}} lost {{prior to their}} discovery at a monastery on Mt. Athos in 1854. While his major work The Refutation of All Heresies was readily accepted (once the false attribution to Origen was resolved), his two small works, On the Twelve Apostles of Christ and On the Seventy Apostles of Christ, are still regarded as dubious, put in the appendix of his works in the voluminous collection of the writings of early church fathers. Here is the complete text of Pseudo-Hippolytus's On the Seventy Apostles of Christ:# James the Lord's brother, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Jerusalem.# Cleopas, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Jerusalem.# Matthias, who supplied the vacant place {{in the number of}} the twelve apostles.# Thaddeus, who conveyed the epistle to Augarus.# Ananias, who baptized Paul, and was <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Damascus.# Stephen, the first martyr.# Philip, who baptized the eunuch.# Prochorus, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Nicomedia, who also was the first that departed, 11 believing together with his daughters.# Nicanor died when Stephen was martyred.# Timon, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Bostra.# Parmenas, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Soli.# Nicolaus, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Samaria.# Barnabas, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Milan.# Mark the Evangelist, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria.# Luke the Evangelist.These two belonged to the seventy disciples who were scattered by the offence of the word which Christ spoke, “Except a man eat my flesh, and drink my blood, he is not worthy of me.” But the one being induced to return to the Lord by Peter’s instrumentality, and the other by Paul’s, they were honored to preach that Gospel on account of which they also suffered martyrdom, the one being burned, and the other being crucified on an olive tree.Silas, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Corinth.Silvanus, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Thessalonica.Crisces (Crescens), <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Carchedon in Gaul.Epænetus, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Carthage.Andronicus, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Pannonia.Amplias, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Odyssus.Urban, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Macedonia.Stachys, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Byzantium.Barnabas, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> HeracleaPhygellus, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Ephesus.

5|$|One {{of the new}} {{generation}} <b>of</b> <b>bishops</b> was the bishop of Olinda, Dom Vital. In 1872, he expelled Freemasons from lay brotherhoods. All forms of Freemasonry had long been forbidden to all Catholics under pain of excommunication.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the break}} with Rome, {{it was the}} Pope and general councils of the Church that decided doctrine. Church law was governed by canon law with final {{jurisdiction}} in Rome.

50|$|There is {{record of}} a number <b>of</b> 3rd-century married <b>bishops</b> in good standing, even in the West.

5|$|After Ealdred's death, {{one of the}} {{restraints}} on William's treatment of the English was removed. Ealdred {{was one of a}} few native Englishmen who William appears to have trusted, and his death led to fewer attempts to integrate Englishmen into the administration, although such efforts did not entirely stop. In 1070, a church council was held at Westminster and a number <b>of</b> <b>bishops</b> were deposed. By 1073 there were only two Englishmen in episcopal sees, and by the time of William's death in 1089, there was only one, Wulfstan II of Worcester.|$|E
5|$|Beacon Park {{stands on}} land which was {{originally}} low lying, poorly drained pasture alongside the Leamonsley Brook. The Museum Gardens and Recreation Grounds were the site <b>of</b> <b>Bishops</b> Fish Pool (sometimes known as Upper Pool). The pool was created when a causeway {{was built on}} Beacon Street in the 14th century separating it from Minster Pool. The waterlogged marshland surrounding Bishops Fish Pool became known as 'The Moggs' from the 15th century and later 'Swan Moggs'.|$|E
5|$|But reform {{brought with}} it new ways of {{thinking}} about the church and its personnel, derived not only from contemporary continental movements but also from the rich pastoral and canonical literature of the Carolingian renaissance. This disseminated ideas concerning the separation of the lay and religious spheres, the distinction between monks and clergy, and enhanced the authority <b>of</b> <b>bishops</b> as both pastoral and political leaders. Ultimately, these ideas were to strike at deeply entrenched features of the early medieval church, such as hereditary control of churches and the right of the clergy to marry.|$|E

5|$|In 1115 Henry sent Warelwast back to Rome to {{negotiate}} with Paschal, who was angry that the king was prohibiting papal legates in England, not allowing clerics {{to appeal to the}} papal court, and was failing to secure papal sanction for church councils or the translation <b>of</b> <b>bishops.</b> Warelwast was unable to change the pope's mind, but he did manage to prevent sanctions against the king. Henry also employed Warelwast as a papal envoy during the Canterbury–York disputes over the primacy in the English Church, with visits in 1119, 1120, and possibly also in 1116.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{following}} the death of John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI, head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith under John Paul, was elected. He was known for upholding traditional Christian values against secularisation, and for liberalising use of the Tridentine Mass as found in the Roman Missal of 1962. In 2012, the 50th anniversary of Vatican II, an assembly of the Synod <b>of</b> <b>Bishops</b> discussed re-evangelising lapsed Catholics in the developed world. Benedict resigned due to advanced age in 2013, the first pope to do so in nearly six hundred years.|$|E
5|$|Monarchs {{and other}} dignitaries were often in {{attendance}} at the cathedral, and the court occasionally held session there. The building was also the scene of several incidents of mediaeval intrigue. In 1191, whilst King Richard I was in Palestine, his brother John summoned a council <b>of</b> <b>bishops</b> to St Paul's to denounce William de Longchamp, Bishop of Ely—to whom Richard had entrusted the affairs of government—for treason.|$|E

5|$|Noteworthy also, {{is a story}} {{written down}} by Adam of Bremen in his Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum (Deeds <b>of</b> <b>Bishops</b> of the Hamburg Church) from 1075/6 about a certain {{foreigner}} called Hericus, who was slain and martyred while preaching among the Sueones. Adam had heard the story from King Sweyn II of Denmark. According to some historians, resemblance to later legend about an English-born Henricus, who was allegedly slain and martyred in Finland, is too striking to be a coincidence.|$|E
5|$|Several episcopalians, {{supporters}} of the existing system <b>of</b> <b>bishops,</b> were {{also included in the}} summoning ordinance, but Parliament may have nominated them to lend greater legitimacy to the Assembly and not have expected them to attend because Charles had not approved of the Assembly. Only one, Daniel Featley, participated, and he only until his arrest for treason in October 1643.|$|E
5|$|The Battle <b>of</b> <b>Bishops</b> Court was a {{shift in}} Brilliants focus from {{capturing}} French privateers to direct engagement with an enemy naval squadron. Between 21 and 26 February 1760 a force of three French vessels, the 44-gun Maréchal de Belle-Isle, the 36-gun Blonde and the 30-gun Terpsichore, arrived {{off the coast of}} Ireland. Under the command of privateer François Thurot, they landed 600 French troops and captured the town of Carrickfergus. Thurot held the town for five days.|$|E

5|$|The Church that Sigeberht {{had done}} so much to {{establish}} in East Anglia survived for two centuries, enduring 'evil times' (such as the period when the kingdom was under attack by the armies of Penda of Mercia).

5|$|The Metropolitan Council is the {{permanent}} executive {{body of the}} Church's administration.

The Council is headed by a chairman (the current Metropolitan), and is composed of the OCA's chancellor, secretary, treasurer, and selected clergy and lay delegates. It usually meets twice per year, but in December 2006 a rare joint meeting between the Metropolitan Council and the Holy Synod <b>of</b> <b>Bishops</b> was held.|$|E
