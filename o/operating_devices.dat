40|$|Remotely <b>operated</b> <b>devices</b> {{for traffic}} control—portable traffic lights and {{automated}} flagger assistance devices—are {{used to improve}} flagger safety in a one-lane-each-way work zone with lane closure. Previous research has measured {{the effectiveness of these}} devices as driver compliance rates and driver understanding of the devices, but the effects of these devices on driver behavior have not yet been examined comprehensively. Therefore, the influence of remotely operated stop–slow traffic control devices on driver behavior was examined. Video-recorded traffic movements from a rural work zone in the Queensland state of Australia provided driver speeds, deceleration profiles, stopping behavior, and compliance rates for a set of remotely <b>operated</b> <b>devices</b> new to Australia: static red–amber–green lights, static red–amber lights, static red–amber arrow lights, and mechanical stop–slow signs. Pneumatic tube traffic counters were used to collect driver speeds before and after the devices, and an on-road driver survey was conducted to elicit driver understanding of the devices. Results indicated that drivers had difficulty understanding the new devices, particularly the amber light and amber arrow options (which confused drivers about their meaning—to stop or to go). The new remotely <b>operated</b> <b>devices</b> resulted in higher approach speeds, greater variability in approach speeds, and faster deceleration rates than the flagger method. The good compliance rates observed with the remotely <b>operated</b> <b>devices</b> imply that the devices could improve flagger safety by reducing flagger exposure to traffic; however, the negative effects on driver behavior might indicate an increased risk of rear-end crashes in the advance warning area...|$|R

30|$|One of the widely-used {{protocols}} {{to connect}} the remote RTUs with a central supervisory computer is Modbus/TCP (Khan and Mauri 2013). Although Modbus is a generally accepted industrial process standard, especially popular in {{the oil and gas}} sector, it also {{plays an important role in}} power distribution (Bush 2014; Kenner et al. 2016). It is a master/slave type of protocol, where only one of the communicating devices, called master (or “client”), can initiate the communication. The slave (or “server”) continuously listens for incoming connections on TCP port 502. Modbus stores either 1 bit values (so-called coils) or 1 byte values (so-called registers). Both coils and registers can be either read-only values (discrete inputs and input registers, respectively) or read/write values (coils or holding registers, respectively). In order to allow for, e.g., floating point variables, some vendors allow for combining registers to hold 32 -bit and 64 -bit values (Hadžiosmanović et al. 2014). Security extensions for Modbus/TCP protocol have been proposed, e.g., (Fovino et al. 2009; Shahzad et al. 2015; Éva et al. 2018), which, however, do require changes on the protocol level of <b>operating</b> <b>devices.</b> This is expected to be difficult as companies are reluctant to such changes and global standardization. Without a uniform standard, the proposed approaches may be incompatible with existing systems. No dedicated Modbus security standards exist, however, one could argue that IEC 62351 (IEC Webstore 2018) also encompasses Modbus as it is nowadays usually runs over TCP/IP. The proposed testbed uses Modbus/TCP as it is still often used; we propose a network-monitoring approach of securing this protocol, that does not require changes on the protocol level of <b>operating</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|E
40|$|Topological Insulator-based devices can {{transport}} electrons/photons at {{the surfaces}} of materials without any back reflections, even {{in the presence of}} obstacles. Topological properties have recently been studied using non-reciprocal materials such as gyromagnetics or using bianisotropy. However, these effects usually saturate at optical frequencies and limit our ability to scale down devices. In order to implement topological devices that we introduce in this paper for the terahertz range, we show that semiconductors can be utilized via their cyclotron resonance in combination with small magnetic fields. We propose novel terahertz <b>operating</b> <b>devices</b> such as the topological tunable power splitter and the topological circulator.

We show that Cu-phthalocyanine acts, via hybrid interface states, as a local spin filter up to room temperature both below and above the Fermi energy, E(F). At the same time, the molecule behaves as a featureless scattering barrier in a region of about 1 eV around E(F).
