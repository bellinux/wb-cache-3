2500|$|Sciatic nerve {{exploration}} {{can be done}} by endoscopy in a {{minimally invasive}} procedure to assess lesions of the nerve. [...] Endoscopic treatment for sciatic nerve entrapment has been investigated in deep gluteal syndrome; [...] "Patients were treated with sciatic nerve decompression by resection of fibrovascular scar bands, piriformis tendon release, <b>obturator</b> <b>internus,</b> or quadratus femoris or by hamstring tendon scarring." ...|$|E
2500|$|The ventral hip muscles {{function}} as lateral rotators and {{play an important}} role in the control of the body's balance. Because they are stronger than the medial rotators, in the normal position of the leg, the apex of the foot is pointing outward to achieve better support. The <b>obturator</b> <b>internus</b> originates on the pelvis on the obturator foramen and its membrane, passes through the lesser sciatic foramen, and is inserted on the trochanteric fossa of the femur. [...] "Bent" [...] over the lesser sciatic notch, which acts as a fulcrum, the muscle forms the strongest lateral rotators of the hip together with the gluteus maximus and quadratus femoris. When sitting with the knees flexed it acts as an abductor. The obturator externus has a parallel course with its origin located on the posterior border of the obturator foramen. It is covered by several muscles and acts as a lateral rotator and a weak adductor. The inferior and superior gemelli represent marginal heads of the <b>obturator</b> <b>internus</b> and assist this muscle. The three muscles have been referred to as the triceps coxae. The quadratus femoris originates at the ischial tuberosity and is inserted onto the intertrochanteric crest between the trochanters. This flattened muscle act as a strong lateral rotator and adductor of the thigh.|$|E
50|$|This group {{consists}} of the externus and <b>internus</b> <b>obturators,</b> the piriformis, the superior and inferior gemelli, and the quadratus femoris. These six originate at or below the acetabulum of the ilium and insert {{on or near the}} greater trochanter of the femur.|$|R
2500|$|The ventral hip {{muscles are}} {{important}} in {{the control of the}} body's balance. [...] The internal and external obturator muscles together with the quadratus femoris are lateral rotators of the hip. [...] Together they are stronger than the medial rotators and therefore the feet point outward in the normal position to achieve a better support. The obturators have their origins on either sides of the obturator foramen and are inserted into the trochanteric fossa on the femur. [...] Quadratus arises on the ischial tuberosity and is inserted into the intertrochanteric crest. [...] The superior and inferior gemelli, arising from the ischial spine and ischial tuberosity respectively, {{can be thought of as}} marginal heads of the <b>obturator</b> <b>internus,</b> and their main function is to assist this muscle.|$|E

50|$|The {{nerve to}} <b>obturator</b> <b>internus</b> is a nerve that innervates the <b>obturator</b> <b>internus</b> and gemellus {{superior}} muscles.|$|E
5000|$|The gemellus {{superior}} and gemellus inferior help to laterally rotate the extended thigh. Both muscles {{also help to}} steady the femoral head in the acetabulum by assisting the <b>obturator</b> <b>internus</b> muscle, [...] "The gemelli aid <b>obturator</b> <b>internus</b> in its action. As <b>obturator</b> <b>internus</b> turns around the lesser sciatic notch it loses some of its power; this is compensated for {{by the action of}} the gemelli." ...|$|E
50|$|The Gemellus {{inferior}} {{arises from}} {{the upper part of}} the tuberosity of the ischium, immediately below the groove for the <b>Obturator</b> <b>internus</b> tendon. It blends with the lower part of the tendon of the <b>Obturator</b> <b>internus,</b> and is inserted with it into the medial surface of the greater trochanter. Rarely absent.|$|E
50|$|It {{serves as}} part of the origin for the <b>Obturator</b> <b>internus</b> muscle.|$|E

5000|$|Like the <b>obturator</b> <b>internus</b> muscle, the gemellus {{superior}} and gemellus inferior help to steady the femoral {{head in the}} acetabulum. Both muscles also help to laterally rotate the extended thigh and abduct the flexed thigh at the hip ...|$|E
