5000|$|Indigo {{lake was}} {{originally}} produced from {{the leaves of}} woad, and was known in ancient Egypt. In the late Middle Ages, a fashion for woad as a textile dye led to <b>overplanting</b> and soil exhaustion {{in many parts of}} Europe. After trade routes opened to the east, indigo was imported from India as a substitute for woad, and the cultivation of woad became uneconomical in Europe. Today, the dark blue dye known as indigo once produced from woad and Indigofera tinctoria is largely of synthetic origin. The dye and pigment are both fugitive.|$|E

Panoramic views were restored by eliminating <b>overplanting.</b> Based on Ross's original drawings for the course, greens were restored to their original shapes and sizes, and his unique bunkering style was reestablished. Length was added to neutralize the effect technology has had on golf and brought Ross's unique design features back into play in quite an effective fashion.|$|E
50|$|In the 19th {{and early}} 20th century, American elm {{was a common}} street and park tree owing to its {{tolerance}} of urban conditions, rapid growth, and graceful form. This however led to extreme <b>overplanting</b> of the species, especially to form living archways over streets, which ultimately produced an unhealthy monoculture of elms that had no resistance to disease and pests. These trees' rapid growth and longevity, leading to great size within decades, also favored its horticultural use {{before the advent of}} Dutch elm disease. Ohio botanist William B. Werthner, discussing the contrast between open-grown and forest-grown American elms, noted that: In the open, with an abundance of air and light, the main trunk divides into several leading branches which leave the trunk at a sharp angle and continue to grow upward, gradually diverging, dividing and subdividing into long, flexible branchlets whose ends, at last, float lightly in the air, giving the tree a round, somewhat flattened top of beautifully regular proportions and characteristically fine twiggery.|$|E

50|$|The {{house itself}} {{comprises}} three storeys and features an imposing main entrance {{on the southern}} side. Some of the trees in its garden, including horse chestnuts, pines and planes, {{date back to the}} 1890s when Trevenna was built. The garden is constructed on several levels. A sunken garden, complete with stone sundial and fish pond, is {{on one side of the}} house, while on the other a series of hedges encloses a private lawn. The grounds also feature a gardener's shed, the smaller Trevenna Cottage, and a clay tennis court. They also include a herb garden and orchard and numerous dry-stone walls, some of which have been <b>overplanted</b> with ivy hedges. A private gravel road of 300 metres, lined with pines and lamp posts on either side, leads off Trevenna Road and winds through parklands up to the house.|$|R
5000|$|Until about 1900, {{there were}} no large scale, {{scientific}} attempts to cultivate new varieties of hops. There were some known varieties, but they were identified primarily by geography and gross differences in the plants' characteristics. While hops were propagated by root cuttings, [...] "cloning" [...] certain genomes, little effort was expended in preserving specific strains or in producing new, high quality cultivars. On top of this, crop yield was highly variable from year to year, due {{to the effects of}} disease, pests, and rainfall. Farmers would experience a full crop yield perhaps once in a decade, leading to <b>overplanting,</b> which in turn caused large variances in the supply and price of hops between good and bad harvests. Wye College started a hop cultivation program in 1904 to address this issue by applying new principles of plant breeding to the crop. By 1917, Salmon and Wye had partnered with the East Malling Research Station to grow hops on a larger scale, in order to evaluate the commercial properties of promising crosses.|$|E
5000|$|First {{recorded}} in the United States in 1964, Acapulco Gold was defined by the Oxford English Dictionary the following year as [...] "a special grade of cannabis growing {{in the vicinity of}} Acapulco...with a color of brownish gold, or a mixture of gold and green." [...] Traditionally cultivated in the Guerrero Mountains outside the city, it is a landrace strain described as having [...] "mind-blowing effects", which were attributed to a long growing season and the plant growing in conditions to which it was adapted. Smuggler and promoter Gary Tovar said that Acapulco Gold's distinctive color was the outcome of the way the plants were aged and dried by the wind off the Pacific Ocean. When cultivated outside its native range, it is considered to be substantially less potent than native plants: [...] "while the original genetics of Acapulco Gold can be found among global seed companies, without that blazing Acapulco sun and Gulf breezes, the end product remains an artifice, a simulacrum of what could be had in 1974." [...] As early as 1975, New York Magazine claimed that the strain's original potency had already been diluted due to <b>overplanting</b> in response to demand.|$|E
40|$|A work of {{creative}} fiction {{in the form}} of a short novel, Asleep in the Arms of God is a limited-omniscient and omniscient narrative describing the experiences of a man named Wafer Roberts, born in Jack County, Texas, in 1900. The novel spans the years from 1900 to 1925, and moves from the Keechi Valley of North Texas, to Fort Worth and then France during World War One, and back again to the Keechi Valley. The dissertation opens with a preface, which examines the form of the novel, and regional and other aspects of this particular work, especially as they relate to the postmodern concern with fragmentation and conditional identity. Wafer confronts in the novel aspects of his own questionable history, which echo the larger concern with exploitative practices including racism, patriarchy, <b>overplanting</b> and overgrazing, and pollution, which contribute to and climax in the postmodern fragmentation. The novel attempts to make a critique of the exploitative rage of Western civilization...|$|E
30|$|The hybrids {{and parents}} were planted on 17 -July during the 2011 rainy season (July to October) and on 24 -January during 2012 summer season (January to April) at ICRISAT, Patancheru. Monthly mean {{temperatures}} varied from 20 °C to 31 °C and relative humidity from 50 % to 93 % {{during the rainy}} crop season. In the summer crop season, monthly mean temperatures varied from 16 °C to 40 °C and relative humidity from 22 % to 79 %. Both trials were planted in randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications but in adjacent blocks. Sowing was done by tractor-mounted 4 -cone planter (7100 US model). Each entry was planted in two rows of 2  m length, spaced at 75  cm between rows in rainy season and 60  cm in summer season. <b>Overplanted</b> plots were thinned 15 d after planting to single plants spaced 15  cm apart within each row. A basal dose of 100 kg of diammonium phosphate (18 % N and 46 % P) was applied {{at the time of}} field preparation and 100 kg of urea (46 % N) was applied as top dressing within 2 to 4 d after thinning. Fields were irrigated at 7 to 10 d intervals in summer crop season and twice in rainy crop season to ensure no moisture stress. All the recommended agronomic practices were followed for good crop growth. At the time of planting, four well spread representative soil samples were collected from the experimental fields from 0 – 30  cm layer and later bulked to prepare one composite sample for micronutrient analysis.|$|R
500|$|Since the 1940s, Khrushchev had {{advocated}} {{the cultivation of}} corn (maize) in the Soviet Union. He established a corn institute in Ukraine and ordered thousands of acres to be planted with corn in the Virgin Lands. In February 1955, Khrushchev gave a speech in which he advocated an Iowa-style corn belt in the Soviet Union, and a Soviet delegation visited the U.S. state that summer. While their intent was to visit only small farms, the delegation chief was approached by farmer and corn salesman Roswell Garst, who persuaded him to insist on visiting Garst's large farm. The Iowan visited the Soviet Union in September, where he became great friends with Khrushchev, and Garst sold the USSR [...] of seed corn. Garst warned the Soviets to grow the corn {{in the southern part}} of the country, and to ensure there were sufficient stocks of fertilizer, insecticides, and herbicides. This, however, was not done, as Khrushchev sought to plant corn even in Siberia, and without the necessary chemicals. While Khrushchev warned against those who [...] "would have us plant the whole planet with corn", he displayed a great passion for corn, so much so that when he visited a Latvian kolkhoz, he stated that some in his audience were probably wondering, [...] "Will Khrushchev say something about corn or won't he?" [...] He did, rebuking the farmers for not planting more corn. The corn experiment was not a great success, and he later wrote that overenthusiastic officials, wanting to please him, had <b>overplanted</b> without laying the proper groundwork, and [...] "as a result corn was discredited as a silage crop—and so was I".|$|R

40|$|After uptake in cereal crops, {{nitrogen}} (N) {{is rapidly}} assimilated into glutamine (Gln) and other amino acids for transport to sinks. Therefore Gln has potential as an improved indicator of soil N availability compared to plant N demand. Gln has primarily been assayed to understand basic plant physiology, {{rather than to}} measure plant/soil-N under field conditions. It was hypothesized that leaf Gln at early-to-mid season could report the N application rate and predict end-season grain yield in field-grown maize. A three-year maize field experiment was conducted with N application rates ranging from 30 to 218 kg ha− 1. Relative leaf Gln was assayed from leaf disk tissue using a whole-cell biosensor for Gln (GlnLux) at the V 3 -V 14 growth stages. SPAD (Soil Plant Analysis Development) and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) measurements were also performed. When sampled at V 6 or later, GlnLux glutamine output consistently correlated with the N application rate, end-season yield, and grain N content. Yield correlation outperformed GreenSeekerTM NDVI, and was equivalent to SPAD chlorophyll, indicating the potential for yield prediction. Additionally, depleting soil N via <b>overplanting</b> increased GlnLux resolution to the earlier V 5 stage. The {{results of the study}} are discussed in the context of luxury N consumption, leaf N remobilization, senescence, and grain fill. The potential and challenges of leaf Gln and GlnLux for the study of crop N physiology, and future N management are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Extract: Eighty years ago, in April 1935, {{an ominous}} wall of blowing sand and dust {{swept across the}} Great Plains caused by years of <b>overplanting,</b> poorly managed crops and severe drought conditions. During these massive storms, people were forced to crawl {{on hands and knees}} in search of shelter, {{literally}} unable to see their hands in front of their faces. Cars stalled and stopped in the choking dust. Many thought {{the end of the world}} had come. Jane Hardisty (The Farmer’s Exchange, New Paris, Indiana, 24 April 2015) thus described the ‘Dust Bowl’ in Oklahoma and Kansas that started on the newly ploughed American plains and went on to choke much of the country in the east. Soil is essential for the life of all things that grow in the ground and those that consume what grows in the ground. Ground and water are the most obvious building blocks for life on Earth. We walk on the ground. We pick fruits from the trees and shrubs that grow in the ground. After the rain new spurts of life appear from the ground. Of course, more than soil and water are needed for life on Earth; nothing is more essential than the sun and its role in driving the whole system. But to describe the totality of the planet’s life-support system is another book, in fact many books. Soil warrants its own story. Australian soils are a sub-set of the planet’s soils, and are our subject matter...|$|E
40|$|RZ-SHAW {{is a new}} {{hybrid model}} {{coupling}} the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) and the Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAM model to extend RZWQM applications to conditions of frozen soil and crop residue cover RZ-SHAW offers the comprehensive land management options of RZWQM with the additional capability to simulate diurnal changes in energy balance needed for simulating the near-surface microclimate and leaf temperature. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate RZ-SHAW for simulations of radiation balance and sensible and latent heat fluxes <b>overplant</b> canopies. Canopy energy balance data were collected at various growing stages of winter wheat in the North China Plain (36 degrees 57 'N, 116 degrees 6 'E, 28 m above sea level). RZ-SHAW and SHAW simulations using hourly meteorological data were compared with measured net radiation, latent heat flux, sensible heat flux and soil heat flux. RZ-SHAW provided similar goodness-of-prediction statistics as the original SHAW model for all the energy balance components when using observed plant growth input data. The root mean square error (RMSE) for simulated net radiation, latent heat, sensible heat, and soil heat fluxes was 29. 7, 30. 7, 29. 9, and 25. 9 W m(- 2) for SHAW and 30. 6, 32. 9, 34. 2, and 30. 6 W m- 2 for RZ-SHAW, respectively. Nash-Sutcliffe R- 2 ranged from 0. 67 for sensible heat flux to 0. 98 for net radiation. Subsequently, an analysis was performed using the plant growth component of RZ-SHAW instead of inputting LAI and plant height. The model simulation results agreed with measured plant height, yield, and LAI very well. As a result, RMSE for the energy balance components were very similar to the original RZ-SHAW simulation, and latent, sensible, and soil heat fluxes were actually simulated slightly better RMSE for simulated net radiation, latent heat, sensible heat, and soil heat fluxes was 31. 5, 30. 4, 30. 2, and 2 7. 6 W m(- 2). respectively. Overall, the results demonstrated a successful coupling of RZWQM and SHAW in terms of canopy energy balance simulation, which has important implications for prediction of crop growth, crop water stress, and irrigation scheduling...|$|R
