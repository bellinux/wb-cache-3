5|$|Fishing is the {{principal}} industry in Sisimiut, with harvested stocks of shrimps, salmon, halibut and cod. The Royal Greenland fish processing plant at the port is the largest within Greenland and is amongst the most modern shrimp-shelling factories in the world. In 2008, supplied by 8 boats and the factory trawlers, the plant processed an annual amount of 20,180 tons <b>of</b> <b>shrimp,</b> around 1,680 tons per month. This was roughly constant throughout the year, although when fish catches were larger the fish was frozen. The plant eventually sold around 6,019 tonnes <b>of</b> <b>shrimp.</b> Hunting {{is also important to}} some of the local livelihoods, mainly seals, walrus, beluga whale, narwhale, reindeer and muskoxen.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} species <b>of</b> <b>shrimp</b> and fish take refuge among the {{branches}} of Millepora alcicornis, seemingly immune to the venom. Hawkfish in particular often perch {{on top of the}} fire coral, perhaps protected by their skinless pectoral fins. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Millepora alcicornis has few predators. The fireworm (Hermodice carunculata) sometimes grazes on it, but prefers other corals. Certain nudibranchs in the genus Phyllidia eat it as do filefish in the family Monacanthidae.|$|E
5|$|This grebe eats mostly insects, of both {{adult and}} larval stages, {{as well as}} crustaceans, molluscs, tadpoles, and small frogs and fish. When {{moulting}} at lakes with high salinity, although, this bird feeds mostly on brine shrimp. The behaviour of black-necked grebes changes {{in response to the}} availability of brine shrimp; bodies of water with more shrimp have more grebes, and grebes spend more time foraging when the amount <b>of</b> <b>shrimp</b> and the water temperature decreases.|$|E

Islands of different periodicities {{have recently been}} shown to be connected by spirals that emanate from a joint focal point, paving ways to wander around in parameter space without ever crossing the chaotic sea. We discuss the shrimp building and scaling principles as well as the influence of individual system properties.

5|$|The Gaza Strip's cooking {{style is}} similar to culinary styles adopted {{by the rest of}} the Levant countries, and is also {{influenced}} by the Mediterranean coast. The staple food for the majority of the inhabitants in the area is fish. Gaza has a major fishing industry and fish is often served either grilled or fried after being stuffed with cilantro, garlic, red peppers and cumin and marinated in a mix of coriander, red peppers, cumin, and chopped lemons. Besides fish, as well as other types of seafood, Zibdieh, is a clay pot dish that consists <b>of</b> <b>shrimp</b> baked in a stew of olive oil, garlic, hot peppers, and peeled tomatoes. Crabs are cooked and then stuffed with a red hot pepper paste called shatta.|$|E
5|$|Crustaceans, such as sand fiddler {{crabs and}} shrimp, among the {{mangroves}} also occupy a significant {{place in the}} local economy. While a large number <b>of</b> <b>shrimp</b> species inhabit the Senegambian area, a single family exists in Casamance: Penaeidae. Southern pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus notialis) are the most commonly collected. They were traditionally caught as part of local artisan fishing by men, women, and children. Shrimp collection in the area experienced significant development in the 1960s, following the establishment of European industrial units. The local fishermen switched to this method, {{and there was an}} increased presence of fishermen from other areas. A study in 2005 revealed {{the extent to which the}} shrimp population in the region has been depleted, citing multiple causes, including diminishing rainfall, over-salinization of the estuary, and poorly controlled harvesting. Along with the mangrove degradation, the civil unrest, and the inadequate fishery regulation, Casamance has had to deal with the closure in 2003 of a major industrial complex in Ziguinchor which treated and exported shrimp and other crustaceans and employed more than 2,000 people.|$|E
5|$|In Chittagong, about 115km (70mi) {{north of}} where Akash moved ashore, surface {{stations}} reported peak winds of 37km/h (23mph) and a pressure of 996.8vhPa. Near its landfall location, Akash produced high tides that flooded coastal areas {{with up to}} 1.5m (5ft) of water, destroying at least 30businesses. The cyclone destroyed 205houses and left an additional 845 damaged. Akash caused moderate crop damage near the coast, including 2ha (4.9acres) of destroyed lands <b>of</b> <b>shrimp</b> farms. Heavy precipitation was reported, with one station reporting a total of 53mm (2.12in); the rainfall caused flooding in inland areas. The heavy rains, caused by outer bands of the cyclone before it made landfall, limited play in Chittagong in the third One Day International cricket match between India and Bangladesh, before the match was abandoned. Strong winds caused power outages throughout Cox's Bazar District, and downed about 200 trees on St. Martin's Island. The cyclone left a total of 10boats unaccounted for, with about 50fishermen missing. In total, three fisherman were confirmed killed, all on St. Martin's Island, with two people left hospitalized. The passage of Cyclone Akash left many people homeless. Initially {{there was no response}} from the government. In all, 14 people were killed by Akash and damages amounted to US$982million.|$|E
40|$|Experiments in {{freezing}} of cooked, {{peeled and}} unpeeled shrimps {{have been carried}} out in order to find out the effect of vacuum-packing and use of carbon dioxide gas in packing <b>of</b> the <b>shrimps</b> during storing at temperatures of - 25 ° and - 16 °C. Shrimps stored both in vacuum and in carbon dioxide gas maintained quality better than similar samples stored in air at the same temperature. Especially the vacuum-packed samples were definitely better than the others both in colour, taste and texture. The samples stored in carbon dioxide did not keep quite so well, and the samples <b>of</b> <b>shrimps</b> stored in air at the same temperature and in similar packing material were pronounced inferior to the others. Vacuum-packing is therefore considered to be preferable in freezing and storing <b>of</b> <b>shrimps.</b> With a satisfactory vacuum-tight packing it is found possible to store frozen shrimps longer and obtain a higher quality than now is common in commercial freezing <b>of</b> <b>shrimps.</b> The plastic bags used in the experiments were vacuum-tight and strong enough for the packing <b>of</b> peeled <b>shrimps,</b> but the bags were easily penetrated during the packing <b>of</b> unpeeled <b>shrimps.</b> A better method would probably be to freeze unpeeled shrimps in alginate. The experiments also confirmed that the storage temperature is very important in storing <b>of</b> <b>shrimps,</b> and in storing at a temperature of - 25 °C the quality was much better than at a temperature of - 16 °C...|$|R

5|$|In Mexico, {{the diamond}} {{stingray}} {{is one of}} the most important components of Pacific artisanal shark and ray fisheries, comprising around a tenth of the total annual catch. Its significance is likely underestimated, as Mexican fishery reports frequently suffer from misidentifications and a lack of species-specific data. It is mainly caught during summer and fall, being the most common ray landed in Bahía Magdalena, and second most common ray landed off Sonora state. Demersal gillnets are the main fishing gear employed; both adult and juvenile rays easily become entangled in the mesh by their tail spines, with juveniles known to have comprised most of the Bahía Magdalena catch in 19982000. This species is also often caught incidentally in bottom trawls, on longlines, and in fish traps. In the future, habitat degradation from increasing numbers <b>of</b> <b>shrimp</b> farms may pose an additional threat to this species in the region. As a result of these pressures, the IUCN has assessed the diamond stingray as Near Threatened in Mexican waters. No management schemes have yet been enacted for this species.|$|E

25|$|Shrimp {{trawling}} {{can result}} in very high incidental catch rates of non-target species. In 1997, the FAO found discard rates up to 20 pounds for every pound <b>of</b> <b>shrimp.</b> The world average was 5.7 pounds for every pound <b>of</b> <b>shrimp.</b> Trawl nets in general, and shrimp trawls in particular, {{have been identified as}} sources of mortality for species of finfish and cetaceans. Bycatch is often discarded dead or dying by the time it is returned to the sea, and may alter the ecological balance in discarded regions. Worldwide, shrimp trawl fisheries generate about 2% of the world's catch of fish in weight, but result in more than one third of the global bycatch total.|$|E
