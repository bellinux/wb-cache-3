Years later, early renewal of the bank's charter became the primary issue in the reelection of President Andrew Jackson. After Jackson, who was opposed to the central bank, was reelected, he pulled the government's funds <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank.</b> Jackson was the only President to {{completely}} pay off the debt.

Brice disappeared the day that a grand jury was to convene on the case. In 1948, she was discovered in a mental hospital.|$|E

25|$|After {{fourteen}} {{hours of}} occupation and repelling government attempts to retake the bank, the ambassadors of Europe, principally through the good offices of Russian consul Maxmiov, {{and the director}} of the bank, Sir Edgar Vincent (Lord of Abernon), succeeded in persuading the Armenian men to leave the bank, by promising to meet to their demands as well as grant them safe passage <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank.</b> Sir Edgar's secretary, told that their action would alienate the European powers and cause a 'fearful massacre of Armenians' but they replied that if they died they would do so as martyrs and patriots. They were assured of a pardon and unhindered departure from the city on board Sir Edgar Vincent's private yacht.|$|E
25|$|Around May 1834, the Melvilles {{moved to}} another house in Albany, a three-story brick house. That same month a fire {{destroyed}} Gansevoort's skin-preparing factory, which left him with personnel he could neither employ nor afford. Instead he pulled Melville <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> to man the cap and fur store. (Biographer Andrew Delbanco says that Gansevoort was doing so well he could hire his younger brother until a fire broke out in 1835, destroying both factory and the store.) In any case, older brother Gansevoort served {{as a role model}} for Melville in various ways. In early 1834 Gansevoort had {{become a member of the}} Albany's Young Men's Association for Mutual Improvement, and in January 1835 Melville became a member as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{treasury}} was his portfolio, {{but he did}} not recognise {{the financial}} disaster that could result from US government actions. Sterling was draining <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> of England at an alarming rate, and it was getting worse. The canal was blocked by the Egyptians, and most oil shipments were delayed as tankers had to go around Africa. The US government refused any financial help until Britain withdrew its forces from Egypt. When he did realise this, he changed his mind and called for withdrawal on US terms, while exaggerating the financial crisis. On 6 November Macmillan informed the Cabinet that Britain had lost $370m in {{the first few days of}} November alone. Faced with Macmillan's prediction of doom, the cabinet had no choice but to accept these terms and withdraw. The Canal remained in Egyptian hands, and Nasser's government continued its support of Arab and African national resistance movements opposed to the British and French presence in the region and on the continent.|$|E

At times high waters encounter ice on the river and back up, spreading <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>banks.</b> <b>The</b> wide flatness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> terrain, formed from an ancient lake bed, and <b>the</b> low slope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river also contribute to severe flooding in the region.|$|R
25|$|Lola {{hangs up}} the phone and starts running (in an {{animated}} sequence) down the staircase of her apartment, past a punk with a dog, and (back in live action) through the streets of Berlin towards her father's bank and she collides with a woman pushing a baby carriage, who is shown to later steal a baby after having lost custody of her own. Continuing, Lola runs alongside a cyclist who offers to sell her his bike, which she refuses; a flash-forward shows him being robbed on his bike but later marrying a nurse from the hospital in which he recovered. Lola then causes a car crash, which involves her father's colleague, Mr. Meier, and three men in a white BMW. As Lola arrives at the bank, she passes a banker shown later to be paralyzed in a car accident, then killing herself shortly after. She meets her dad, who dismisses her request for help; he reveals that he's not her biological father and that he plans to elope with his pregnant mistress, and then has Lola escorted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank.</b> A security guard who consoles her is shown to later suffer a heart attack.|$|E

2500|$|The {{history of}} Bank of America {{dates back to}} October 17, 1904, when Amadeo Pietro Giannini founded the Bank of Italy in San Francisco. The Bank of Italy served the needs of many {{immigrants}} settling in the United States at that time, providing services denied {{to them by the}} existing American banks which typically discriminated against them and often denied service to all but the wealthiest. Giannini was raised by his mother and stepfather Lorenzo Scatena, as his father was fatally shot over a pay dispute with an employee. [...] When the 1906 San Francisco earthquake struck, Giannini was able to save all deposits <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> building and away from the fires. Because San Francisco's banks were in smoldering ruins and unable to open their vaults, Giannini was able to use the rescued funds to commence lending within a few days of the disaster. From a makeshift desk consisting of a few planks over two barrels, he lent money to those who wished to rebuild.|$|E

Noah manages to free the hostages, but is then taken hostage himself.
