The United Nations Security Council, the United Nations General Assembly, the International Court of Justice, and the International Committee of the Red Cross {{refer to it as}} <b>Occupied</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Territory.</b> The area and population of Jerusalem includes that of East Jerusalem which has been de facto annexed by Israel and incorporated within Jerusalem's municipal borders under the Jerusalem Law. This, however, is not recognized by the international community who regard East Jerusalem as part of the <b>Occupied</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Territory.</b>|$|E

Residents of the Golan Heights {{are entitled to}} citizenship, voting rights and residency {{that allows them to}} travel within Israel's borders. Israel no longer exercises military control in the Gaza Strip, but has subjected it to blockades and other measures it deems necessary to Israeli security. The government of Israel has declared that it observes the international humanitarian laws contained in the Fourth Geneva Convention in the occupied territories. Israel denies that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, both of which it has signed, are applicable to the <b>occupied</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>territory.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 13 April 2011, the UNHCR {{recommended}} that the General Assembly reconsider the report at its sixty-sixth session (to be held in September 2011), and urges the Assembly to submit that report to the Security Council for its consideration and appropriate action, including consideration of referral {{of the situation in}} the <b>Occupied</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Territory</b> to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, pursuant to article 13 (b) of the Rome Statute. The resolution was drafted by the Palestinian Authority and adopted by the Human Rights Council with 27 states voting in favour, three against, and 16 abstentions. It followed the second report of a Committee of Independent Experts, established to monitor the domestic investigations into violations committed during the conflict, which was submitted to the Human Rights Council on 18 March 2011. The report concurred with Amnesty International's assessment that – more than 18 months since the UN Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict documented crimes under international law committed by both sides – the Israeli authorities and the Hamas de facto administration have failed to conduct investigations meeting the required international standards of independence, impartiality, thoroughness, effectiveness and promptness. The General Assembly has already twice called on the domestic authorities to conduct credible, independent investigations into the serious violations of international humanitarian and international human rights law documented by the UN Fact-Finding Mission, in resolutions adopted in November 2009 and February 2010. Those calls appear to have been ignored meaning that the General Assembly would be entitled to submit the issue to the Security Council.|$|E
500|$|Tim Ferguson met Richard Fidler busking on {{the streets}} of Canberra in 1984, while they were both {{attending}} university. Ferguson recalls: [...] "Richard was playing the guitar—something from Cat Stevens—one day and I walked up to him and we did 'Wild Thing'. I sang a few lyrics and jumped about like a mad thing. Lo and behold we made a stack of money in ten minutes." [...] The two began performing together and joined with another friend, Robert Piper, to form the Doug Anthony All Stars. They derived their name from Doug Anthony, a former Country Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. According to Fidler, during their earlier gigs in clubs and as street performers, Ferguson was [...] "a bit of an explosive hippie" [...] while Fidler and Piper were more reserved. Robert Piper left the group in 1985 due to other commitments. Piper has gone on to a successful career with the United Nations and in March 2013 was named Deputy Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process and the humanitarian coordinator for the <b>Occupied</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Territory.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Hitchens {{supports}} Israel and {{denies the}} notion of <b>occupied</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>territory,</b> viewing the British exit from Mandatory Palestine as having left a legal vacuum. He also praises Israel's [...] "European" [...] culture, which he says makes Israel [...] "the permanent ally, in the Middle East, of the world's lawful and free countries", and which he suspects {{is the main reason}} for the perceived hostility of the Arab governments.

[...] In reaction the government of Israel ceased cooperating with the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights and boycotted the UN Human Rights Commission. The U.S. government acceded to the Israeli government demand to attempt to thwart the formation of such a panel.|$|E

2500|$|In 2004 the International Court of Justice, in an advisory, {{non-binding}} opinion, {{noted that}} the Security Council had described Israel's policy and practices of settling parts of its population and new immigrants {{in the occupied territories}} as a [...] "flagrant violation" [...] of the Fourth Geneva Convention. The Court also concluded that the Israeli settlements in the <b>Occupied</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Territory</b> (including East Jerusalem) have been established [...] "in breach of international law" [...] and that all the States parties to the Geneva Convention are under an obligation to ensure compliance by Israel with international law as embodied in the Convention.|$|E
2500|$|Ahava Dead Sea Laboratories, Limited ( [...] , Love) is an Israeli {{cosmetics}} {{company with}} headquarters in Lod that manufactures skin care products made {{of mud and}} mineral-based compounds from the Dead Sea. [...] The company has flagship stores in Israel, Germany, Hungary, South Korea, the Philippines and Singapore. , Ahava income was more than US$150 million a year. Ahava products have caused controversy, as critics say the company uses natural resources of <b>occupied</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>territory,</b> and that the products are incorrectly labeled as made in Israel. In 2015 the Chinese investment firm Fosun International agreed to purchase a controlling share of the company, which has been valuated to ca. NIS 300 million ($77 million USD).|$|E
2500|$|Relations with Israel have {{improved}} significantly following Mohamed Morsi's removal, with Sisi saying {{he talks to}} Israel's prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, [...] "a lot." [...] Sisi {{has been described by}} The Economist as [...] "the most pro-Israeli Egyptian leader ever." [...] With continuous support for Palestine, the Sisi administration supports the two-state solution establishing a Palestinian state on lands that were occupied in 1967 [...] with Eastern Jerusalem as its capital for the Israeli–Palestinian conflict achieving the Palestinians needs and granting Israel the security it wants. The first months of Sisi's presidency witnessed the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict. Egypt also criticised the IDF operation in the Gaza Strip as [...] "oppressive policies of mass punishment rejecting 'the irresponsible Israeli escalation' in the <b>occupied</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>territory,</b> which {{comes in the form of}} 'excessive' and unnecessary use of military force leading to the death of innocent civilians." [...] It also demanded Israel adopt self-restraint and to keep in mind that being an [...] "occupation force", it has a legal and moral duty to protect civilian lives.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2013, {{the church}} {{published}} a report entitled [...] "The Inheritance of Abraham: A Report on the 'Promised' Land" [...] {{which included a}} discussion of Israeli and Jewish claims to the Land of Israel. The report said [...] "there has been a widespread assumption by many Christians {{as well as many}} Jewish people that the Bible supports an essentially Jewish state of Israel. This raises an increasing number of difficulties and current Israeli policies regarding the Palestinians have sharpened this questioning," [...] and that [...] "promises about the Land of Israel were never intended to be taken literally." [...] The church responded to criticism by saying that [...] "The Church has never and is not now denying Israel's right to exist; on the contrary, it is questioning the policies that continue to keep peace a dream in Israel and the <b>Occupied</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Territory.</b> This report is against the injustices levelled against the Palestinian people and how land is shared. It is also a reflection of the use or misuse of scripture to claim divine right to land by any group" [...] and says it must [...] "refute claims that scripture offers any peoples a privileged claim for possession of a particular territory".|$|E
2500|$|On 3 January 2009, in {{response}} to the Gaza War, the Organisation of the Islamic Conference's executive committee asked the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to send a fact-finding mission to Gaza. On 12 January, the council adopted Resolution S-9/1, deciding [...] "to dispatch an urgent, independent international fact-finding mission, to be appointed by the President of the Council, to investigate all violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law by the occupying Power, Israel, against the Palestinian people throughout the <b>Occupied</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Territory,</b> particularly in the occupied Gaza Strip, due to the current aggression, and calls upon Israel not to obstruct the process of investigation and to fully cooperate with the mission" [...] Upon being asked to lead the Mission, former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson expressed disappointment with the mandate and refused to head the Mission for that reason. She stated that the resolution adopted by UN Human Rights Council was one-sided and [...] "guided not by human rights but by politics". She later expressed full support for the report. Richard Goldstone initially refused the appointment for the same reason, calling the mandate [...] "biased" [...] and [...] "uneven-handed". In January 2011, Goldstone said that the UNHRC [...] "repeatedly rush to pass condemnatory resolutions in the face of alleged violations of human rights law by Israel but fail to take similar action in the face of even more serious violations by other States. Until the Gaza Report they failed to condemn the firing of rockets and mortars at Israeli civilian centers".|$|E
