5000|$|An [...] "everything" [...] bagel is {{essentially}} a normal bagel, {{with the addition of}} multiple toppings to enhance the flavor. Poppy seeds, sesame seeds, <b>onion</b> <b>flakes,</b> caraway seeds, garlic flakes, pretzel salt, and pepper, are all popular toppings that most vendors use on an everything bagel. The everything bagel inspired other bread creations with similar toppings, such as everything bagel chips, everything croissants, everything rolls, everything roti, everything fusilli, and everything hot dog buns. It is offered by many bakeries and fast casual restaurants such as Au Bon Pain and Panera. Attardo notes that [...] "everything" [...] in this context is not to be interpreted as implying infinite recursion: It consists a bagel covered with every topping/flavoring used on the bagels. The scope of everything is clearly limited. Consider that if the everything label were taken literally, these bagels would be very strange indeed, since they should include every object in the universe, including those very bagels as well, ad infinitum. Here the affordance of BAGEL delimits the universal quantifier to things that people put on bagels and that go well together.Most likely the bagel is vegan. The mechanism whereby the delimitation is achieved is of some interest. BAGEL affords being cooked (first boiled and then baked), being eaten, and being covered/baked with spices/condiments. These affordances interact interestingly, because since the bagels are made to be eaten, only tasteful combinations of flavors can be accepted (a blueberry/onion bagel would not be very appetizing to the average American) and a fortiori no inedible toppings may be used, or objects that would not fit in an oven (which rules out “galaxy” bagels—a seriously “everything” bagel would need to include our galaxy, at the very least). Michael Preston, executive director of the Florida Consortium of Metropolitan Research Universities, notes that in life, the only time it is possible to have everything is on a bagel.|$|E

Deterministic models yield single value estimations of shelf-life typically based on average or worst-case values for input parameters. In deterministic calculations, considering the input parameter variability can be challenging. In this study, a Monte Carlo procedure and the G. A. B. model for moisture sorption isotherms were used to predict shelf-life frequency distributions for intermediate moisture (IM) tomato slices, and low moisture (LM) <b>onion</b> <b>flakes</b> and sliced green beans. End of shelf-life for IM tomato slices (initial a[subscript w] = 0. 8) was assumed to occur for a 10 % moisture loss, and when a[subscript w] changed from 0. 25 to 0. 4 for LM <b>onion</b> <b>flakes</b> and LM sliced green beans. The estimated shelf-life for tomato slices, LM <b>onion</b> <b>flakes,</b> and LM sliced green beans based on the deterministic approach was 243, 86, and 79 days, respectively. The Monte Carlo procedures yielded shelf-life frequency distributions with values ranging 181 – 366, 76 – 95, and 71 – 90 days, respectively. Products would fail before the deterministic shelf-life value with an unacceptably high probability of 51. 6, 48. 6, and 53. 0 %, respectively. If 5 % is an acceptable probability that the actual shelf-life is shorter than specified, the estimated values would be 211, 81, and 73 days, respectively. X[subscript m] and K were the most influential G. A. B parameters on the shelf-life of the three products. The package area, product amount, and water vapor transmission rate were high contributors and had the expected effect on shelf-life as demonstrated by deterministic estimations...|$|E
40|$|The {{quantitative}} approach to shelf life prediction of foods {{is a relatively}} new field of food technology and the paucity of published studies in this area indicates a need for further research. The present study was undertaken to develop and evaluate a methodology for the shelf life prediction of packaged dried foods using a {{quantitative approach}}. The development of a technique for the shelf life prediction of packaged dried foods, specifically <b>onion</b> <b>flakes,</b> sliced green beans, and apricot halves, involved the mathematical modelling of product and package characteristics as functions of environmental conditions, i. e. temperature and humidity. The WVTR and permeability constants of LDPE (60 µm), PET (12 µm) and a laminate of both films (30 µm LDPE and 12 µm PET) were determined at different temperatures and humidities. A general model was developed which satisfactorily predicted permeances of the three films as a function of external relative humidity and temperature. The moisture sorption isotherms of the three products were determined at 20, 30, and 40 °C. The GAB model adequately described the isotherms using a direct nonlinear regression analysis. The kinetics of the deteriorative reactions limiting the shelf life of the three dried products and their acceptable limits were determined. Storage trials were conducted on the three products under different relative humidity (32 % to 59 % RH for dried <b>onion</b> <b>flakes</b> and green beans; 59 % to 81 % RH for dried apricot) and temperature (20 °C to 40 °C) conditions. Nonenzymic browning in <b>onion</b> <b>flakes</b> and chlorophyll a loss in green beans were better described by a zeto-order reaction model. Thiolsulphinate loss in <b>onion</b> <b>flakes,</b> nonenzymic browning in apricot, and SO 2 loss in both green beans and apricots were better described by a first-order reaction model. For <b>onion</b> <b>flakes</b> and green beans, the rates of reactions were found to increase with an increase in the water activity of the products. Empirical equations were derived describing the relationship between the rates of reactions and water activity. The Arrhenius equation satisfactorily described the relationship between rate constants and temperature. Nonensymic browning and sulphur dioxide loss in dried apricots exhibited a trend wherein the rate increased with water activity until a maximum was reached and then decreased with a further increase in water activity. The reactions followed the Arrhenius equation at all three water activity levels. Mathematical models of quality deterioration in the dried foods were developed based on the theoretical and empirical equations obtained on the kinetics of the deteriorative reactions as functions of storage time, water activity and temperature. There was close agreement between the actual and predicted shelf lives of the unpackaged dried foods stored under variable temperature and relative humidity conditions. In order to predict the shelf life of the dried products packaged in polymeric films, a computer iterative technique was developed which combined the models describing the permeability characteristics of the packaging films, the sorption properties of the product, the kinetics of deterioration in the products and the mass transport equation. By solving these equations numerically {{with the aid of a}} computer, moisture gain, quality loss and shelf life of the products were satisfactorily predicted under various storage conditions...|$|E
40|$|Raw plant {{materials}} {{are vital to}} our health and well-being because they are furnished with essential vitamins, minerals, fiber, and other health-promoting phytochemicals. Its increasing consumption forces food manufacturers to assure consumers of a proper microbiological purity of their products. Thus, microbiological purity {{is an important factor}} during assessing their suitability in the production process. The sources of raw plant material contamination are particularly soil particles which are brought during harvest, transport and storage and also microorganisms (bacteria, moulds and yeasts), which are associated with their living environment. The decontamination methods which have been used so far, cause a significant reduction of infective microflora, though it is observed a change or loss their valuable components such as: essential oils and biologically active substances. Thus, the aim {{of this paper is to}} propose an alternative method of decontamination such as ozonation. Microbial status of samples of Elettaria cardamomum (L.)

Similar fillings {{were used to}} prepare trout wontons by wrapping the mixture with Chinese wonton dough and 2 products were made: raw wonton (uncooked) and fried wonton (fried for 8 min at 140 ºC). Storage trials were performed on raw and fried trout wontons (a w 0. 98 [...] 0. 95, pH 6. 5), and partially and fully cooked trout burgers (aw 0. 97 [...] 0. 96, pH 6. 4). Products were packaged in air and under various modified atmospheres (MAP), and stored at 4 and 12 ºC. A microbiological shelf-life of > 28 days was possible for the cooked trout burgers and fried wontons stored at 4 ºC. In general, the microbiological shelf-life preceded the sensory shelf-life. Subsequent challenge studies were done to address the safety concerns associated with MAP food. All products were inoculated with 102 CFU/g of Listeria monocytogenes and 102 spores/g of Clostridium botulinum type E spores. Gas packaging with 80 % CO 2 (balance N 2) inhibited the growth of L. monocytogenes in products stored at 4 ºC. However, counts of L. monocytogenes increased in all other packaging conditions.

40|$|The {{formation}} of sub-micron sized particulates {{has been studied}} in a low pressure (0. 1 mbar) radio-frequency (13. 56 MHz) capacitively coupled plasma discharge. Particles are studied in situ by infrared absorption spectroscopy, laser illumination and Cavity Ring Down Absorption Spectroscopy. Transmission Electron Microscopy was applied ex situ for particulates collected during the plasma. We propose that two principal mechanisms {{may be involved in}} the {{formation of}} these particulates: formation and trapping of negative ions in the gaseous phase, and the recycling of material deposited on the electrodes during the discharge, by film erosion or delamination. The relative importance of these two mechanisms was studied in silane, methane, ethylene and acetylene plasmas. The growth of the particulates in silane plasmas, monitored with Infrared and Cavity Ring Down Absorption Spectroscopy, allowed us to distinguish an increasing volume growth phase followed by an agglomeration phase at constant volume, in agreement with the literature. A slight powder and film recycling effect is detected as the experiments are repeated, as observed by an increasing particle size. The hydrogen content of powder formed in silane plasmas was estimated in situ by infrared absorption spectroscopy and changes in the infrared absorption spectrum could be observed for silane diluted with hydrogen and argon. In particular, the porous structure of the powder was observed from the high content of surface related vibration bonds relative to bulk related bonds. Photoluminescence was detected for the particles at 2. 15 eV that could possibly be attributed to the crystalline structure of the particles. Infrared Absorption Spectroscopy and mass spectrometry applied in situ showed that acetylenic compounds are preferentially produced in methane, ethylene and acetylene plasmas and that the hydrogen content of the other species produced in these plasmas depends on the initial gas hydrogen content. Negative ions were evidenced in these plasmas and a polymerization reaction is proposed between acetylene and C 2 nHx- negative ions to explain the formation of particle's precursors. The formation of aromatic structures is suggested for n> 3. The different relative abundance of C 2 Hx- ions is proposed to explain the different powder production rates with different initial gases or different fluxes. Hydrogen may inhibit the formation of high-mass negative ions and particles. Fast growth of spherical amorphous carbon particles (∼ 100 s) was observed for a low pressure (0. 1 mbar) acetylene plasma. The sp 3 structure was confirmed in situ by infrared absorption spectroscopy. Slow growth (∼ 1000 s) of irregularly shaped particles is observed for methane plasmas at the same pressure and power. Particle heterogeneity was studied with Transmission Electron Microscopy and showed graphitic <b>onions,</b> multiwalled nanotubes, <b>flakes</b> and agglomerates attributed to the erosion or the delamination of the deposited carbon layer. The influence of the recycling of the deposited layer on the powder formation was observed in situ from enhanced particle formation as the experiments were repeated. A similar behavior was observed for discharges containing mixtures of hexamethyldisiloxane, oxygen and helium. Keeping in mind that the control of powder homogeneity implies a control over the reactor contamination and its history, we conclude that {{an important part of the}} particulates formed in the discharges studied depends on the gas phase reactions, determined by the plasma chemistry...|$|R
