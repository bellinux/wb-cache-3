25|$|Inside this residence, {{the house}} {{originally}} {{had a very}} simple interior, with a large living room to the right <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> a simple dining room straight ahead, a long hallway to the left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> a simple spiral staircase in the front hall, and a small kitchen and servants' quarters in the back (now a bigger kitchen). In {{the interior of the}} house, the forms of the rooms were simple but combined to make a more complex structure like Breuer and Gropius advocated. The house has four bedrooms and four bathrooms.|$|E
25|$|George {{would wake}} up to the sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> slamming. He would race downstairs to find the dog {{sleeping}} soundly at the front door. Nobody else heard the sound although it was loud enough to wake the house.|$|E
25|$|Tynan Abbey was {{demolished}} in 1998 due to {{the unstable}} structure of the ruin. All that remains is the arch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> surround. In September 2007, The Three Estates Walking Festival was held within the Tynan estate, along with the lands at Caledon and Castle Leslie.|$|E

50|$|In the 1980s, a car {{drove into}} <b>the</b> {{original}} <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> Schaller’s. In <b>the</b> 1990s, a dump truck drove through <b>the</b> <b>front</b> façade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building, destroying <b>the</b> second iteration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
25|$|People with OCD can use rationalizations {{to explain}} their {{behavior}}; however, these rationalizations {{do not apply to}} the overall behavior but to each instance individually. For example, a person compulsively checking the front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> is much less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus checking is the better option. In practice, after that check, the person is still not sure and deems it is still better to perform one more check, and this reasoning can continue as long as necessary.|$|E
25|$|The current Hubbard House {{is mostly}} a typical I-house design but the two-story front (west) section {{of the house was}} not {{constructed}} until 1872. Until that time the Hubbard family was confined to the smaller, one-story portion of the house. Quarters were cramped during this time. The two-story portion of the house features windows on both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> and three windows on the second-floor, representing the typical I-house design. Sometime after both sections were completed a bay window was added in the angle between the wings. Elbert's room was in the attic, a room which still existed when the building was nominated to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
25|$|Eighty-seven {{people died}} in the {{resulting}} fire. Nineteen bodies were found downstairs; the others upstairs. Six bodies were found within several feet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> Some of those trapped punched a hole through a wall to an adjoining union hall in an attempt to escape. Most of the deaths were from asphyxiation or due to having been trampled. Most of the victims were young Hondurans celebrating Carnival, largely drawn from members of the local Garifuna American community. The fire was the deadliest in New York City since the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in 1911, and the deadliest in the United States since the Dupont Plaza Hotel fire in Puerto Rico in 1986.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the first}} year that Chevy Vans had side-marker lights, {{mandated}} by federal government regulations. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> lights were located towards <b>the</b> <b>front</b> in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors,</b> while <b>the</b> rear marker lights were located about a foot inward <b>of</b> <b>the</b> very back edge just below <b>the</b> vertical middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> van.|$|R

5000|$|In October 1952 the Paris Motor Show welcomed a {{modified}} 203 which now featured hinged quarter light windows [...] on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> and an enlarged rear {{window on the}} saloon versions. [...] This upgrade also saw <b>the</b> removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speedometer from <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dashboard to a position directly ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> driver.|$|R
25|$|The Julian Street Jr. {{residence}} {{is still}} extant. By 1974, {{the house was}} owned by Howard and Janette R. Tomkins and the property was subdivided to allow a separate building lot. Other changes were {{the removal of the}} stone wall and guardrail by the driveway, which was then paved with asphalt, and building a playhouse {{at the top of a}} rock pile in front of the house. The house was also changed: the stone wall behind the house was extended into a curve while the front gravel walkway was retained, the ramp behind the serpentine wall had stairs added to it, a curved wall was added in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> and a flagstone terrace was added to the back and side of the west part of the house. By the late 1970s, the house was owned by the Birnbaum family, who added steps to the front ramp up to the house, reduced the height of the serpentine wall, and added a raised entertainment area in part of the large living room.|$|E
500|$|The site faces south, {{with its}} back to Court Hill, {{and the road}} may have passed east-west within [...] <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> The great hall, screens passage, porches and chapel blocks have all survived from the early 14th century and the square headed chapel windows contain {{reticulated}} tracery of the decorated period. These buildings were probably complete by 1322 although the parapets of the porches and chapel may have been remodelled at a later date. The 14th-century building embodied older structures including a small four-storey tower that dates, perhaps, to {{the mid to late}} 13th century, and the building that became the 14th-century kitchen (now the museum) was probably the earlier hall.|$|E
500|$|Home Secretary Willie Whitelaw, who {{had been}} chairing COBRA during the siege, was rushed back to Whitehall from a {{function}} he had been attending in Slough, roughly [...] away, arriving 19 minutes after the shots had been reported. He was briefed on the SAS plan by de la Billière, who told him to expect that up to 40 percent of the hostages would be killed in an assault. After deliberations, Whitelaw instructed the SAS to prepare to assault the building at short notice, an order that was received by Mike Rose at 15:50. By 17:00, the SAS were {{in a position to}} assault the embassy at ten minutes' notice. The police negotiators recruited the imam from a local mosque at 18:20, fearing that a [...] "crisis point" [...] had been reached, and asked him to talk to the gunmen. Three further shots were fired {{during the course of the}} imam's conversation with Oan. Oan announced that a hostage had been killed, and the rest would die in 30minutes unless his demands were met. A few minutes later, Lavasani's body was dumped out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> Upon a preliminary examination, conducted at the scene, a forensic pathologist estimated that Lavasani had been dead for at least an hour, meaning he could not have been killed by the three most recent shots, and leading the police to believe that two hostages had been killed. In fact, only Lavasani had been shot.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> main {{entrance}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church is deeply recessed within a Gothic arched opening. The original wooden doors matched the tympanum area's inset panels above the doors. [...] The doors were replaced to meet fire code. On either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> is a carved fleur-de-lis, {{a symbol of}} purity {{that is used to}} represent the Blessed Virgin Mary under whose patronage the church is dedicated.|$|R
5000|$|A body {{design that}} {{appeared}} {{very early in}} history of light-duty trucking was the [...] "delivery car or van was actually <b>the</b> first type <b>of</b> panel truck." [...] A panel truck is similar in function to its smaller cousin the sedan delivery, a station wagon with no backseat and no side windows aft <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors.</b> Both types <b>of</b> vehicles are frequently used as delivery vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|Interior {{fittings}} were reasonably comprehensive by <b>the</b> standards <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time, with a {{full width}} shelf under the dashboard and [...] "useful pivoting ventilator panels" [...] (hinged quarterlights) at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> edge <b>of</b> each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> and a rear window blind included in the price. [...] Instrumentation included an oil pressure gauge, an ammeter and an electric clock. [...] Also available, albeit at extra cost, was a heater.|$|R
2500|$|... and {{it still}} has the {{original}} big, old, pannelled front door. It is of the traditional rural, symmetrical, [...] four-up, four-down domestic design which was common in the Georgian era and continued throughout the 19th century. [...] This type of house has two rooms each side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> stairs in the middle leading back from the front door, and two upstairs bedrooms {{each side of the}} stairwell, with a 19th-century dressing room above the front hall. The walls between front and back rooms are load-bearing, and supported by the two chimneys, which allow fireplaces in all eight main rooms.|$|E
2500|$|The façades of Number 25-27 are insidiously {{similar in}} appearance. [...] The first have been {{repeatedly}} rebuilt old doors removed, windows enlarged, the plain plastered surface {{added in the}} early 20th century, and the concrete portal in the 1970s while the rough-cast façade and stone portal of the other is overall 18th century in character and largely unaltered since 1757. [...] Not much different is Number 16 {{on the opposite side}} of the street, the four cast iron pilasters and the fair-faced plaster of which is unaltered since 1889, while there was originally a depressed rounded arch over the double sliding doors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1954 the Imperial Custom {{had a new}} grille {{consisting}} of a heavy wraparound horizontal center bar with five ridges on top and integrated circular signal lights. Its front fender nameplate was above a chrome strip, which ran the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> {{to the front of}} the door opening. The rear fender stone guard was larger than in 1953, but the rocker panel molding and rear fender chrome strip style were still the same. The back-up lights were now located directly below the taillights, rather than dividing the lights as in the previous year's model. The Imperial Crown shared basic styling with the Imperial Custom. However it had center-opening rear doors and Cadillac-like rear fender taillights. Air conditioning was standard on the Imperial Crown [...]|$|E

5000|$|In July 2012, the C5 {{was given}} another mild facelift, {{with a few}} {{cosmetic}} changes, such as softer chevron badging, modified badging of C5, softer chevron [...] "grille" [...] as per the recently updated C4, and exclusive badges (on the Exclusive) on <b>the</b> sides in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors.</b> For <b>the</b> Exclusive the onboard GPS/radio head was also changed to the eMyWay unit which features full Bluetooth connectivity and iPod/USB interface.|$|R
50|$|As part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tie-up {{with the}} Rover Group the European Accord spawned Rover's {{replacement}} for the Austin Montego in 1993. Called the 600, the car shared its platform with the European Accord and, with <b>the</b> exception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors,</b> lower rear doors and windscreen, sported unique styling which dispensed with the rear quarter windows. <b>The</b> interior design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 600 was {{very similar to the}} Accord's however, while the dashboard design was identical.|$|R
2500|$|According to the prosecution, Simpson {{was last}} seen in public at 9:36p.m. that evening when he {{returned}} to the front gate of his house with Brian [...] "Kato" [...] Kaelin, a bit-part actor and family friend who had boarded with Nicole until he was given the use of a guest house on Simpson's estate. Simpson was not seen again until 10:54p.m.—an hour and 18 minutes later—when he came out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> of his house to a waiting limousine he had hired to take him to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to fly to a Hertz convention in Chicago. The defense and prosecution both agreed that the murders took place between 10:15 and 10:40p.m., with the prosecution alleging that Simpson had driven his white Bronco during the required five minutes to and from the murder scene. They presented a witness in the vicinity of Bundy Drive who saw a car similar to Simpson's Bronco speeding away from the area at 10:35p.m.|$|E
2500|$|The {{exterior}} of the cabin has also undergone changes over the years. Initially, there was no front porch, the main entry was reached by two wooden steps. There was very minimal trim as well after its construction, and very early on there was an Indian geometric design painted on the front door, {{as well as the}} phrase [...] "Apuni Oyis 1914" [...] painted on the front fascia. Apuni Oyis is Blackfoot for [...] "Butterfly Lodge". Above the apex <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> there was an antlered deer skull mounted. The two wooden steps were replaced by a wooden porch, followed by a stone porch, with a wooden railing supported by concrete and rock tapered pylons. The modest trim was replaced very early on, with wider, more ornate trim, which exists to this day. By the end of the 1930s the deer skull was removed, and the skull of steer was placed above the windows. The natural logs lost their bark, and eventually the structure was painted brown, with the trim originally painted green, which was changed to brown later on. Currently, the railing on the porch {{is in a state of}} disrepair, as is the concrete surface of the porch.|$|E
2500|$|One 1996 NABI {{articulated}} bus, 9619 {{was saved}} and converted into MTA's official [...] "Comfort Bus," [...] a bus specially {{designed to be}} dispatched to special events in Baltimore City during the summer to provide air conditioning to the attendees of special events and to be dispatched around the city for displaced city residents whose homes were made uninhabitable by fire or other causes to provide them heat {{in the winter and}} air conditioning in the summer. The interior for 9619 was heavily modified from its revenue service design with three interior roof mounted AC units, modified seating arrangement, tables, a water cooler, microwave, mini-fridge, wall electrical outlets, and a door facing the public-area of the bus prohibiting access from going in and out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> entrance and exit for the public is only through the rear door. Artscape 2015 was the very first event with very high temperatures that 9619 was deployed to as the official MTA Maryland Comfort Bus and the bus had major problems keeping the interior comfortably air conditioned from the three interior roof mounted AC units that were installed. MTA on July 20, 2015 posted to their Facebook page in a comment to an Artscape 2015 attendee who boarded 9619 and experienced the lack of air conditioning: [...] "We spoke with the HVAC specialists who work on the Comfort Zone Bus and they are aware of and working on the issue. Sorry for the discomfort you experienced. Because the Comfort Zone Bus is a new innovation, sometimes it takes a trial or two to get the bugs worked out. Thanks for letting us know!" ...|$|E
25|$|In May 2008, Toyota {{issued a}} recall for 2003 and 2004 model year Corollas and Matrixes. The recall notice cites two bolts in each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> as {{potentially}} causing {{the window to}} come off the track and break. This recall only applies to models equipped with power windows. General Motors issued a recall for the same problem on 2003 and 2004 Pontiac Vibes with power windows at the same time.|$|R

5000|$|For 1955 the Four Hundred {{name was}} re-employed by Packard and {{assigned}} to the automaker's senior model range two-door hardtop. Visual cues that helped to easily identify the 400 included a full color band along <b>the</b> lower portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car topped by a partial color band that truncated along <b>the</b> rear edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors.</b> [...] "The Four Hundred" [...] in gold anodized script adorned the band between <b>the</b> <b>front</b> wheel well and door edge.|$|R
2500|$|Circa 1940 {{images of}} the house show that Modernist {{elements}} were incorporated into Harrison's design. A photograph of the façade reveals a stone garage next to a simple white door, with a high serpentine wall snaking up the ramp path to the front door; the house's two-story façade is made of stone with porthole windows and a large rectangular stone structure to the right <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> It presents a very private and industrial front, with stone and glass, and a ramp path to the door, like a conveyor belt in a factory. The back view exemplifies use of the building's twelve exterior doors, many of them stone and glass, and opens up to a wider view of the back, which is more spacious with trees and in harmony with nature because of the local fieldstone that echoes the surrounding rocky landscape. There is little ornamental decoration, it is simply constructed with industrial materials in keeping with Breuer and Gropius's idea of [...] "unit construction" [...] or the bringing together of [...] "standard units to create a technologically simple but functionally complex whole," [...] {{and the use of}} new materials to create art design that reflected the age of industry. With Harrison's use of steel and glass, as well as the industrial conveyor-belt like ramp to the house's front door, Harrison used new materials to reflect the age of industry, and its simple forms of stone sections form a composite, complex stone entirety. Gropius and Breuer designed Gropius's own house in ppLincoln, Massachusetts]], which used both fieldstone and wood painted white, re-establishing [...] "New England traditionalism in modern terms." [...] With his use of fieldstone in the Street residence, Harrison was even incorporating some of the same materials as the Modernist architects of his time, Gropius and Breuer.|$|E
