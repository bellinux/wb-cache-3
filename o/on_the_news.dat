5|$|I went to Iraq {{because what}} I saw when I {{was over there}} was soldiers—young kids for the most part—helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back on, helping get {{hospitals}} open, helping get the water turned back on and you don't hear any of that <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>news.</b> You hear, 'X number of people were killed today,' which I think does a huge disservice.

5|$|For {{the rest}} of his life, Marmarosa alternated between living with his sister Doris' family and in a veterans' hospital, both in the Pittsburgh area. Some of his friends blamed Marmarosa's family for keeping him in their home because of shame about his mental problems, and {{suggested}} that the family blamed musicians and music for his instability. Marmarosa himself did not explain his withdrawal from performing. Irritated by telephone calls from a fan seeking an interview in 1992, Marmarosa passed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> that he had died; this led to premature obituaries being published in two British newspapers. He sometimes played piano in the family's basement or for other residents at the hospital. His mother died in 1995, after his father. Marmarosa {{died of a heart attack}} on September 17, 2002, in a veterans' hospital in Pittsburgh. He was survived by his two sisters.|$|E
5|$|In England, Stephen's reign {{started off}} well, with lavish gatherings {{of the royal}} court that saw the King give out grants of land and favours to his supporters. Stephen {{received}} the support of Pope Innocent II, {{thanks in part to}} the testimony of Louis VI and Theobald. Troubles rapidly began to emerge. Matilda's uncle, David I of Scotland, invaded the north of England <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> of Henry's death, taking Carlisle, Newcastle and other key strongholds. Stephen rapidly marched north with an army and met David at Durham, where a temporary compromise was agreed. South Wales rose in rebellion, and by 1137 Stephen was forced to abandon attempts to suppress the revolt. Stephen put down two revolts in the south-west led by Baldwin de Redvers and Robert of Bampton; Baldwin was released after his capture and travelled to Normandy, where he became a vocal critic of the King.|$|E

5|$|Li Yuan was Duke of Tang and {{governor}} of Taiyuan during the Sui dynasty's collapse, which was caused {{in part by}} the Sui failure to conquer {{the northern part of the}} Korean peninsula during the Goguryeo–Sui War. He had prestige and military experience, and was a first cousin of Emperor Yang of Sui (their mothers were sisters). Li Yuan rose in rebellion in 617, along with his son and his equally militant daughter Princess Pingyang (d. 623), who raised and commanded her own troops. In winter 617, Li Yuan occupied Chang'an, relegated Emperor Yang to the position of Taishang Huang or retired emperor, and acted as regent to the puppet child-emperor, Emperor Gong of Sui. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> of Emperor Yang's murder by General Yuwen Huaji on June 18, 618, Li Yuan declared himself the emperor of a new dynasty, the Tang.|$|E
5|$|Marge is irritated when Homer's snoring (so loud, it can {{be heard}} {{throughout}} most of the city) keeps her up at night. She sees Dr. Hibbert about the problem, and asks about a surgery, but he says it is expensive and tells them to get out when Homer asks him to do it for free. Developing a sleep problem, she sleeps for a night with Patty and Selma, and hears <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> that her old boyfriend, Artie Ziff, is one of America's five richest people. She drunkenly dictates an e-mail to Artie to congratulate him on his appearance, but Patty and Selma doctor it to use sexual terms in an attempt to split up Marge and Homer, much to Marge's horror (for using the word sex on the Internet). Artie, who over the years seems to have developed a rather frightening obsession with Marge (his house is decorated with a large number of 'Marge' sculptures/paintings), flies in his helicopter to the Simpson house to see Marge.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peattie's {{landlord}} sneaks {{into his}} apartment for pain medication and finds Lynette's body in his bed. Immediately, she contracts a flesh-eating disease. After {{hearing about the}} incident <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>news,</b> Mulder goes to Peattie's apartment and finds the body, now headless. Peattie finds the Wieder family, whom Scully is protecting, and makes a poppet with Scully's hair and photo inside. He places nails in the doll's eyes and Scully promptly goes blind. Peattie breaks into the house, takes Scully's gun and stabs a poppet of Wieder, causing the doctor to collapse in pain. Wieder gets Peattie to admit that he's taking out his own guilt {{about not being able}} to save Lynette by blaming him instead. Mulder shows up, finds Scully's doll and removes the nails from it, allowing her to regain her vision and shoot Peattie. He is placed in a coma and Lynnette's body is shipped back to her home in West Virginia.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, at TGS, {{it is time}} {{to renew}} Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) contract, and Jack decides to {{approach}} the matter carefully as Tracy does not need the money he makes on the show. While negotiating Tracy's new contract, Jack mentions this fact, which comes as a shock to Tracy, who had never realized that he could survive financially without the income. After realizing that Tracy has quit the show, Jack {{must find a way to}} bring him back, after Tracy's son, Tracy Jr. (Bobb'e J. Thompson), complains to Jack about how unbearable his father is to have around the house. Meanwhile, in order to get attention for herself, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) decides to cut her hair for charity as a publicity stunt. Jenna makes an appearance on NBC's Today Show, where her haircut will be broadcast. Meredith Vieira asks Jenna's opinion <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> that Tracy has left TGS.

The two join the FBI task force investigating the bombing, led by special agents Pierson (Sam Anderson) and Takahashi (Hiro Kanagawa). Watts and Black quickly dismiss several false claims of responsibility by terrorist groups. Black listens to the 911 call left by Dees, deducing that the numbers dialled spell the word kaboom on a telephone keypad.|$|E

5|$|Stephen had to {{intervene}} in the north of England immediately after his coronation. David I of Scotland invaded the north <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> of Henry's death, taking Carlisle, Newcastle and other key strongholds. Northern England was a disputed territory at this time, with the Scottish kings laying a traditional claim to Cumberland, and David also claiming Northumbria by virtue of his marriage to the daughter of the former Anglo-Saxon earl Waltheof. Stephen rapidly marched north with an army and met David at Durham. An agreement was made under which David would return most of the territory he had taken, with the exception of Carlisle. In return, Stephen confirmed David's son Prince Henry's possessions in England, including the Earldom of Huntingdon.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed {{heavily on}} his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial. Two weeks after the arrest, he told his friend, journalist Sharon Lawrence, that his fear of needles discouraged him from using heroin and that associating with junkies had convinced him {{it was not a}} drug he wanted to use. Both of Hendrix's Experience bandmates, Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding, later stated that they had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto and they believed that drugs had been planted in Hendrix's bag. Although Hendrix {{was one of the biggest}} stars in North America at the time, and the world's highest-paid performer, only a couple of Toronto newspapers carried the story. His public relations manager, Michael Goldstein, later revealed that he bribed a member of the Associated Press with a case of liquor in an effort to prevent the story from going out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> wire.|$|E
