5|$|On 18 December 2006, Suffolk Constabulary {{reported}} that they had arrested a 37-year-old man on suspicion of murdering all five women. The man was arrested at 07.20 at a house in Trimley St. Martin near Felixstowe, Suffolk. The detention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> was extended by magistrates by a further period of 24 hours, to the maximum of 96 hours allowed under English law.|$|E
5|$|The suspect (later {{identified}} as David Lace) was discovered when {{the profile of}} the killer showed a partial match on the national database, which belonged to a sibling of a previous suspect. A further sample was taken from another sibling, who was not on the database, to help confirm the match via a process called familial searching. At first the police refused to release the identity of the new prime suspect, except to reveal that he had committed suicide in 1988, and had confessed to DeSimone's murder while in custody for an unrelated crime in 1983, 18 months after Hodgson's conviction. His body was exhumed at Kingston cemetery in Portsmouth on 12 August 2009 in order to compare his DNA to that found at the crime scene. Hampshire Constabulary said the breakthrough in the case was only possible because of advances in forensic science and tests on the body would take six weeks, after which a file on the dead suspect could then be submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service. Visitors to the cemetery in Portsmouth said the grave <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> had no headstone and was untended. Police revealed that the suspect's confession was one of seven which had been made since Hodgson's conviction.|$|E
25|$|Police began a manhunt {{and called}} on {{citizens}} to inform about the possible whereabouts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect.</b> Permyakov was detained some 16km away from Gyumri, {{near the village of}} Bayandur, near the Turkish border by Russian border guards.|$|E
40|$|An assault {{occurred}} during which a bite was inflicted on <b>the</b> left ear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> victim, producing a laceration and severing a portion <b>of</b> tissue from <b>the</b> ear. During <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> their investigation police recovered a lacerated fragment of tissue {{thought to be}} of a person's left ear. Impressions of a suspect's dentition were made and cast in dental stone. Positive replicas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> occlusal surfaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect's</b> dentition were subsequently made using acrylic resin. The ear fragment displayed a lacerated border and a surface which exhibited indentations. When compared with <b>the</b> details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect's</b> lower anterior teeth, correspondence was visible between <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> indentations and characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect's</b> dentition. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> transparent acrylic replicas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect's</b> dentition facilitated <b>the</b> interpretation and comparison between the marks retained in the ear fragment and <b>the</b> features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect's</b> dentition...|$|R

25|$|Scotland Yard's {{files on}} the case and also those of the DPP, were to be closed until 2033. This was an unusual decision, {{considering}} the advanced age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect,</b> witnesses and others involved in the case. The files were {{opened to the public}} after special permission was granted in 2003.|$|E
25|$|In November 2015, {{a former}} {{education}} minister in Gaddafi's regime {{was arrested at}} his home in England on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. The man, believed by The Guardian to be Saleh Ibrahim Mabrouk, had applied for political asylum in the UK following the Libyan Civil War in 2011. Eighteen months later, in May 2017, it became known that a successful prosecution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> was unlikely as some of the evidence could not be presented in court owing to issues of national security.|$|E

25|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspects,</b> aged 20–35, were {{identified}} as Ingush or residents of Ingushetia (some of them Chechen refugees). At least five <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspected</b> hostage-takers were declared dead by Russian authorities before the seizure, while eight were {{known to have been}} previously arrested and then released, in some cases shortly before the Beslan attack.|$|R
25|$|In {{a police}} photo lineup, an officer shows {{a group of}} photos to a witness or crime victim and asks {{him or her to}} pick out the suspect. This is {{basically}} a single-blind test of the witness's memory, and may be subject to subtle or overt influence by the officer. There is a growing movement in law enforcement to move to a double-blind procedure in which the officer who shows the photos to the witness does not know which photo is <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect.</b>|$|E
25|$|Authorities named Bourque as {{the suspect}} after {{his family and}} friends saw photos of him during the shootings on Hildegard Drive {{circulating}} on news reports and social media. Multiple sightings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect,</b> by police and the public, continued in {{the second day of the}} manhunt. Up to 300 police personnel were involved in the search. Because Bourque's location was unknown at the time and he was heavily armed, a definitive perimeter and containment protocol was not established and all of the officers' activities were considered high-risk.|$|E
25|$|Twenty one of {{her crew}} of 56 were {{reported}} to be missing following the incident. Four other people {{were reported to have}} been killed. At the inquest, the page from the day's activities was missing from the log book <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> naval vessel, Virago. The crew were buried in Haifa. Captain Banks signalled to abandon ship when he saw the line go, and dived overboard, swimming under the flames until he lost consciousness, and was rescued by members of the Haganah. Empire Cross was scrapped in 1952.|$|E

25|$|A US patent (5,958,684) in 1999 by Leeuwen, {{details the}} methods and {{reagents}} for diagnosis of diseases caused by or associated with a gene having a somatic mutation giving rise to a frameshift mutation. The methods include providing a tissue or fluid sample and conducting gene analysis for frameshift mutation or a protein from this type of mutation. The nucleotide sequence of the suspected gene is provided from published gene sequences or from cloning and sequencing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> gene. The amino acid sequence encoded by the gene is then predicted.|$|E
25|$|On 29 November, at {{the request}} of Burakov and Fetisov, Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, the {{psychiatrist}} who had written the 1985 psychological profile of the then-unknown killer, was invited to assist in the questioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect.</b> Bukhanovsky read extracts from his 65-page psychological profile to Chikatilo. Within two hours, Chikatilo burst into tears and confessed to Bukhanovsky that he was indeed guilty of the crimes for which he had been arrested. After conversing into the evening, Bukhanovsky reported to Burakov and Fetisov that Chikatilo was ready to confess.|$|E
25|$|To {{expand on}} their {{allegations}} that certain defense witnesses had {{been subjected to}} police harassment, and that eyewitness accounts had been flawed, defense attorney Joseph Louisell subjected Sheriff Harvey to a 45-minute cross-examination as to his contact with the two eyewitnesses prior to completion of this composite drawing. In this cross-examination, Sheriff Harvey admitted to having driven Mrs. Goshe and her assistant to East Lansing to view the updated composite drawing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> in Beineman's murder, {{and that he had}} shown photographs of various suspects, including Collins, to Goshe prior to her formally identifying Collins in a lineup.|$|E

25|$|In Genesee County on August 4, 2010, it was {{announced}} that a string of stabbings that date back to May 2010 was the work of one man and a multi-jurisdictional task force was set up to investigate. The next week on August 9, 2010 police in Leesburg connected three hammer attacks against black men there via their victims' descriptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect,</b> video surveillance footage of the attacks that matches his description and vehicle, and the similar mode of operation. The next day Toledo Police claimed a stabbing of a black man there also matched the suspect.|$|E
25|$|On 11 August 2007, The Australian {{reported}} that detectives were calling for information {{to establish the}} identity of a young man seen in the Seven Network's news archive, showing police searching a storm water drain {{in the days after the}} Beaumont Children's disappearance. The man bore a striking resemblance to a youthful Bevan Spencer von Einem. On 13 August 2007, the Seven Network followed this with a story that the man standing next to the Einem lookalike in their archived film matched the police sketch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> seen with the Beaumonts at the beach on the day of their disappearance.|$|E
25|$|According to the Turkish legal system, {{international}} conventions {{on human rights}} automatically {{become part of the}} national legal order without additional transposition once they are ratified by the Parliament. International human rights instruments to which Turkey is party have to be taken into consideration by judges and prosecutors. Therefore, prosecutors are strongly encouraged to directly apply the landmark decisions of the European Court of Human Rights and particularly the Handyside v United Kingdom case. Furthermore, the statement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> cannot be taken before the permission of the Minister of Justice in order not to discredit the suspect {{in the eyes of the}} public.|$|E

40|$|Our aim in {{this essay}} was to find if {{suspects}} of foreign and Swedish background were presented differently in personal case studies made by the probation authority. We have conducted a content analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> personal case studies with male assault offenders in <b>the</b> range <b>of</b> 18 - 23 years old. The study showed that <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> <b>of</b> foreign background were presented differently in comparison to <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> <b>of</b> Swedish background. <b>The</b> differences were noticeable foremost in <b>the</b> description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> relationship to family and friends, but also in <b>the</b> description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> possible criminal values. The personal case studies differed {{in the way that}} <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> <b>of</b> Swedish background had more of a detailed description of relationships to family and friends, but they were also given the opportunity to value their own experience of their relationships. While <b>the</b> description <b>of</b> relationships to <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> <b>of</b> foreign background consisted more of a mapping of family members and friends with no description <b>of</b> how <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> experienced <b>the</b> relationships. <b>The</b> presentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> possible criminal values differed in the way that in the personal case studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> <b>of</b> Swedish background included a professional statement about their non-criminal values, but <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> <b>of</b> foreign background had no such statement nor that they had criminal values. Although this haven´t affected the final statement that the probation officer has done. We have argued that <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> relationship description and statement of criminal values had made <b>the</b> presentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foreign <b>suspect</b> as someone who could be perceived as an impersonal stranger with unknown criminal values where preconceived ideas can grow and lead to stigmatizing processes...|$|R

25|$|The German Navy {{eventually}} {{released the}} four surviving suspects. The body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> {{killed in the}} action was handed back to his relatives in Somalia by the International Red Cross. The Bundeswehr decided not to extradite the men to Kenya after being advised by Operation Atalanta’s headquarters that the men’s conviction after the trial was not granted. At the {{time there was a}} deal with Kenya to judge in that country any act of piracy committed in the Indian Ocean, but on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, as the attack did not affect German interests, the skiff crewmembers were left in a craft within sight of the Somali coast.|$|E
25|$|Having by {{this stage}} {{determined}} a definitive link between {{many of the}} murders committed within the previous year, investigators from the various jurisdictions where victims had been abducted or discovered had themselves begun collaborating information in their collective hunt for the perpetrator. Six officers from three of the jurisdictions in which the Freeway Killer had most regularly either abducted or deposited the bodies of his victims formed a task force dedicated to the apprehension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> or suspects who, {{as one of the}} officers upon this assembled task force later recalled, was striking at an average rate of once every two weeks in the spring of 1980.|$|E
25|$|Obdurate {{continued}} {{to investigate the}} surface contact and subsequently located two German submarines. Coming under attack from one of these submarines, the destroyer dropped depth charges before turning away to attack the Zeppelin. As the destroyer closed on it, though, the Zeppelin turned away to the south-east. Within {{the space of the}} next half an hour, Dublin was unsuccessfully attacked by the German submarines at least three times with torpedoes, leading Dumaresq to conclude that the Germans were attempting to spring a trap on the British vessels. He subsequently ordered Obdurate to complete its investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> vessel, which was subsequently determined to be a Dutch fishing vessel.|$|E
