50|$|The Convention <b>on</b> <b>Road</b> Traffic, {{commonly}} known as the Vienna Convention <b>on</b> <b>Road</b> Traffic, is an international treaty designed to facilitate international road traffic and to increase road safety by establishing standard traffic rules among the contracting parties.

It came into force on 21 May 1977. The convention has been ratified by 74 countries, but those who have not ratified the convention may still be parties to the 1949 Convention <b>on</b> <b>Road</b> Traffic. This conference also produced the Convention <b>on</b> <b>Road</b> Signs and Signals.|$|R

5|$|As a {{tropical}} depression, the storm moved rapidly through the Lesser Antilles; consequently, most islands only experienced minor effects. For example, Saint Lucia received light and sporadic rain showers, accompanied by sustained winds of 20–25mph (32–40km/h) and gusts to 35mph (55km/h). In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, however, the depression dropped up to 9.2inches (235mm) {{of rain in}} 24hours. The rainfall blocked storm drains, including those near the airport, which was forced to shut down. The rainfall caused debris to collect <b>on</b> <b>roads</b> throughout the island. Although the storm passed just 70miles (110km) north of the Yucatán Peninsula, the storm dropped only 0.6inches (15mm) of rain due to its small size.|$|E

50|$|By 1916, {{a series}} of unpaved state roads was laid out from Texola, {{just east of the}} Texas state line, east via Erick to Delhi, north to Sayre, and east and north via Doxey to Elk City. It became part of Route 66 in 1926; this initial {{alignment}} ran along the state line from a bit south of the old railroad grade south to E1240 Road, and then ran east through Texola on Fifth Street. After a mile south <b>on</b> N1680 <b>Road,</b> it turned east <b>on</b> E1250 <b>Road</b> to Erick, then south again <b>on</b> N1750 <b>Road,</b> east <b>on</b> E1260 <b>Road,</b> south <b>on</b> N1810 <b>Road,</b> and east <b>on</b> E1270 <b>Road</b> to Delhi. Traffic turned north at N1870 Road (now US-283), jogging west <b>on</b> E1250 <b>Road</b> at the mismatch in the section lines, and entered Sayre <b>on</b> N1870 <b>Road.</b> The bridge over the North Fork of the Red River in Sayre was built of timber in 1924 and upgraded and widened with steel in 1933. It was bypassed in 1958, and has been demolished; its remains are on private property. The original Route 66 passed through Sayre on Main Street (now SH-152) and Fourth Street, leaving to the east on Benton Boulevard (E1180 Road).

5|$|During World War II, the Main Roads Department focused its {{activities}} on the war effort. Roads in rural areas deteriorated, especially after the Pearl Harbour attack brought the war to the Pacific, and only the most urgent maintenance works were authorised <b>on</b> <b>roads</b> for civilian purposes. Following the war, Main Roads returned to its usual operations, repairing and maintaining the road network. The rural road network expanded in the 1950s, with Main Roads both repairing the worst segments of its roads, through numerous small jobs, and assisting local governments to seal their roads. Such activity was spurred on by the closure of railway lines {{in addition to the}} establishment of new land settlements.|$|E
