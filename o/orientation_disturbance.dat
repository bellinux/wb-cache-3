40|$|Visual {{attention}} is commonly modelled {{by attempting to}} characterise objects using features that make them special or in some way distinctive in a scene. These approaches have the disadvantage that it is never certain what features will be relevant in an object {{that has not been}} seen before. This paper provides a brief outline of the approaches to modeling human visual attention together with {{some of the problems that}} they face. A graphical representation for image similarity is described that relies on the size of maximally associative structures (cliques) that are found to be reflected in pairs of images. While comparing an image with itself, the similarity mechanism is shown to model pop-out effects when constraints are placed on the physical separation of pixels that correspond to nodes in the maximal cliques. Background regions are found to contain structure in common that is not present in the salient regions which are thereby identified by its absence. The approach is illustrated with figures that exemplify asymmetry in pop-out, the conjunction of features, <b>orientation</b> <b>disturbances</b> and the application to natural images...|$|R

In the reported experiments films were deposited AlN onto unheated substrates with a thickness of typically 10 ?m. Deposited films have been characterized {{for a variety of}} layer properties using e. g. XRD, SEM, profilometry, weighting and piezoelectric measurements regarding crystalline structure and orientation, surface morphology, density, film stress and piezoelectric coefficient d 33. The characterized AlN films can be classified into 2 groups. The first group shows a nearly pure 001 orientation of the crystalline structure, an undisturbed surface morphology, a high density and a very high piezoelectric coefficient d 33 of up to 7. 2 pm/V on silicon substrate. The second group exhibits a dominating but not pure 001 <b>orientation,</b> <b>disturbances</b> in the surface morphology, a slightly lower density and a piezoelectric coefficient close to zero. The range of the process parameters pulse mode, pressure, sputtering power and reactive working point to achieve the layers of the first group is very narrow.

40|$|A unique {{training}} device {{is being developed}} at the Johnson Space Center Neurosciences Laboratory to help reduce or eliminate Space Motion Sickness (SMS) and spatial <b>orientation</b> <b>disturbances</b> that occur during spaceflight. The Device for Orientation and Motion Environments Preflight Adaptation Trainer (DOME PAT) uses virtual reality technology to simulate some sensory rearrangements experienced by astronauts in microgravity. By exposing a crew member to this novel environment preflight, {{it is expected that}} he/she will become partially adapted, and thereby suffer fewer symptoms inflight. The DOME PAT is a 3. 7 m spherical dome, within which a 170 by 100 deg field of view computer-generated visual database is projected. The visual database currently in use depicts the interior of a Shuttle spacelab. The trainee uses a six degree-of-freedom, isometric force hand controller to navigate through the virtual environment. Alternatively, the trainee can be 'moved' about within the virtual environment by the instructor, or can look about within the environment by wearing a restraint that controls scene motion in response to head movements. The computer system is comprised of four personal computers that provide the real time control and user interface, and two Silicon Graphics computers that generate the graphical images. The image generator computers use custom algorithms to compensate for spherical image distortion, while maintaining a video update rate of 30 Hz. The DOME PAT is the first such system known to employ virtual reality technology to reduce the untoward effects of the sensory rearrangement associated with exposure to microgravity, and it does so in a very cost-effective manner...|$|R

This study aimed to reveal the differences in mortality and pathogens between HCAP and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in each severity class, and to clarify the strategy for the treatment of HCAP. Methods:We conducted a retrospective observational study of patients with HCAP and CAP who were hospitalized between November 2005 and January 2007, and compared baseline charac-teristics, severity, pathogen distribution, antibiotic regimens, and outcomes. In each severity class (mild, moderate, and severe) assessed using the A-DROP scoring system (ie, age, dehydration, respiratory failure, <b>orientation</b> <b>disturbance,</b> and low BP), we investigated the in-hospital mortal-ity and occurrence of potentially drug-resistant (PDR) pathogens. Results: A total of 371 patients (141 HCAP patients, 230 CAP patients) were evaluated. The proportion of patients in the severe class was higher in the HCAP patients than in CAP patients.

40|$|Collagen {{being the}} most {{abundant}} protein in mammals is important {{for a variety of}} functions and its structure, concentration and <b>orientation</b> <b>disturbance</b> is associated with different pathological states. The use of the optical second harmonic generation (SHG) is emerging as a powerful non-invasive tool for assessing collagen modification in a variety of pathological conditions. The properties of second harmonic light from collagen structures have not yet been fully clarified due to a number of limitations, such as the difficulty to prepare collagen samples with well-known characteristics and optical properties, at a nanoscale resolution. The results of this paper suggest that some of these limitations can be overcome by using thin collagen films with pre-determined characteristics (PDC), which maintain or/and enhance their NLO properties capacities, as they have been checked by using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The collagen fiber structure and orientation was systematically altered by using thermal denaturation or different preparation methodologies (spin coating procedure, use of collagen solution hydrodynamic flow). These films can be used as prototypes and the combined information from AFM imaging and the one included in SHG signal, delivered from them, can significantly contribute to further understanding of the NLO properties of collagen and in the long term to take advantage as a non-invasive tool.

We previously reported a simple prognostic indicator in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) : blood urea nitrogen to serum albumin (B/A) ratio. This retrospective {{study investigated the}} prognostic value of severity indicators in NHAP versus CAP in elderly patients. Methods: Patients aged ≥ 65 years and hospitalized because of NHAP or CAP within the previous 3 years were enrolled. Demographics, coexisting illnesses, laboratory and microbiological findings, and severity scores (confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age ≥ 65 [CURB- 65] scale; age, dehydration, respiratory failure, <b>orientation</b> <b>disturbance,</b> and pressure [A-DROP] scale; and pneumonia severity index [PSI]) were retrieved from medical records. The primary outcome was mortality within 28 days of admission. Results: In total, 138 NHAP and 307 CAP patients were enrolled. Mortality was higher in NHAP (18. 1 %) than in CAP (4. 6 %) (P< 0. 001). Patients with NHAP were older and had lower functional status and {{a higher rate of}} do-not-resuscitate orders, heart failure, and cerebrovascular diseases. The NHAP patients more frequently had typical bacterial pathogens. Using the receiver-operating characteristics curve for predicting mortality, the area under the curve in NHAP was 0. 70 for the A-DROP scale, 0. 69 for the CURB- 65 scale, 0. 67 for the PSI class, and 0. 65 for the B/A ratio. The area under the curve in CAP was 0. 73 for the A-DROP scale, 0. 76 for the CURB- 65 scale, 0. 81 for the PSI class, and 0. 83 for the B/A ratio. Conclusion: Patient mortality was greater in NHAP than in CAP. Patient characteristics, coexisting illnesses, and detected pathogens differed greatly between NHAP and CAP. The existing severity indicators had less prognostic value for NHAP than for CAP.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{relationship}} between HIV-associated psychotic symptoms (i. e., delusions, hallucinations) and demographic, psychopathological and medical variables by comparing patients with and without cerebral opportunistic infections or metabolic encephalopathy. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PATIENTS: 26 patients admitted to hospital with HIV and new-onset psychotic symptoms, defined according to DSM-III-R criteria. OUTCOME MEASURES: A semistructured psychiatric interview using the Psychopathology Assessment Scale (AMDP- 4) of the Association for Methodology and Documentation in Psychiatry system. Comprehensive medical assessments, including laboratory tests and computed tomographic scans, were also performed. RESULTS: Patients with cerebral opportunistic infections or metabolic encephalopathy (i. e., "secondary" psychosis, n = 13) {{were more likely to}} show disorders of consciousness, disorders of <b>orientation</b> and <b>disturbances</b> of attention and memory than those with no evidence of HIV-related cerebral disease (i. e., "primary" psychosis, n = 13); 10 patients (77 %) with cerebral opportunistic infections or metabolic encephalopathy and only 1 (8 %) patient without (p < 0. 001) were diagnosed with delirium. These associations were stronger for the "secondary" patients with no focal brain lesions than for those with lesions. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that "organic" symptoms of psychosis in those infected with HIV are related to the systemic and cerebral complications of HIV infection rather than to the psychotic process itself...|$|R

In the present study, we clarify the significance {{of the number of}} aspiration risk factors for mortality and recurrence in pneumonia patients. Methods: This study included 322 patients hospitalized with pneumonia between December 2014 and June 2016. We investigated associations between the number of aspiration risk factors present (<b>orientation</b> <b>disturbance,</b> bedridden, chronic cerebrovascular disease, dementia, sleeping medications and gastroesophageal disease) and 30 -day and 6 -month mortality, and pneumonia recurrence within 30 days. Results: Patients were categorized by number of risk factors present into groups of 0 – 1, 2, 3, and 4 or more. Of a total of 322 patients, 93 (28. 9 %) had 0 – 1 risk factors, 112 (34. 8 %) had 2, 88 (27. 3 %) had 3, and 29 (9. 0 %) had 4 or more risk factors. The percentages of patients with recurrence of pneumonia were 13. 0 %, 33. 0 %, 43. 2 %, and 54. 2 % in the 0 – 1, 2, 3, and 4 or more risk factor groups, respectively. The percentages of patients with 30 -day mortality were 2. 2 %, 5. 4 %, 11. 4 %, and 24. 1 %, and those of patients with 6 -month mortality were 6. 6 %, 24. 5 %, 30. 7 %, and 50. 0 %, in the 0 – 1, 2, 3, and 4 or more risk factor groups, respectively. Conclusions: The number of aspiration risk factors was associated with increases in both mortality and recurrence in pneumonia patients. Therefore, in clinical practice, physicians should consider not only the presence of aspiration risks but also the number of aspiration risk factors in these patients.

40|$|The {{central nervous}} system must resolve the {{ambiguity}} of inertial motion sensory cues in order to derive an accurate representation of spatial orientation. Previous studies suggest that multisensory integration is critical for discriminating linear accelerations arising from tilt and translation head motion. Visual input is especially important at low frequencies where canal input is declining. The NASA Tilt Translation Device (TTD) was designed to recreate postflight <b>orientation</b> <b>disturbances</b> by exposing subjects to matching tilt self motion with conflicting visual surround translation. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} brief exposures to pitch tilt with foreaft visual surround translation produced changes in compensatory vertical eye movement responses, postural equilibrium, and motion sickness symptoms. Adaptation appeared greatest with visual scene motion leading (versus lagging) the tilt motion, and the adaptation time constant appeared to be approximately 30 min. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare motion perception when the visual surround translation was inphase versus outofphase with pitch tilt. The inphase stimulus presented visual surround motion one would experience if the linear acceleration was due to foreaft self translation within a stationary surround, while the outofphase stimulus had the visual scene motion leading the tilt by 90 deg as previously used. The tilt stimuli in these conditions were asymmetrical, ranging from an upright orientation to 10 deg pitch back. Another objective of the study was to compare motion perception with the inphase stimulus when the tilts were asymmetrical relative to upright (0 to 10 deg back) versus symmetrical (10 deg forward to 10 deg back). Twelve subjects (6 M, 6 F, 22 - 55 yrs) were tested during 3 sessions separated by at least one week. During each of the three sessions (out-of-phase asymmetrical, in-phase asymmetrical, inphase symmetrical), subjects were exposed to visual surround translation synchronized with pitch tilt at 0. 1 Hz for a total of 30 min. Tilt and translation motion perception was obtained from verbal reports and a joystick mounted on a linear stage. Horizontal vergence and vertical eye movements were obtained with a binocular video system. Responses were also obtained during darkness before and following 15 min and 30 min of visual surround translation. Each of the three stimulus conditions involving visual surround translation elicited a significantly reduced sense of perceived tilt and strong linear vection (perceived translation) compared to pre-exposure tilt stimuli in darkness. This increase in perceived translation with reduction in tilt perception was also present in darkness following 15 and 30 min exposures, provided the tilt stimuli were not interrupted. Although not significant, there was a trend for the inphase asymmetrical stimulus to elicit a stronger sense of both translation and tilt than the out-of-phase asymmetrical stimulus. Surprisingly, the inphase asymmetrical stimulus also tended to elicit a stronger sense of peak-to-peak translation than the inphase symmetrical stimulus, even though the range of linear acceleration during the symmetrical stimulus was twice that of the asymmetrical stimulus. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the {{central nervous system}} resolves the ambiguity of inertial motion sensory cues by integrating inputs from visual, vestibular, and somatosensory systems...|$|R

Accurate detection of volcanomagnetic anomalies attributable to the volcano’s dynamics requires removing from measurements of the earth’s magnetic field, fluctuations of external origin which may be up to hundreds of nanotesla during geomagnetic storms. The commonly used method of taking simple differences of the total intensity with respect to the simultaneous value at a remote reference is partially successful. Variations in the difference fields arise principally from contrasting electromagnetic properties at magnetometer sites. To improve the noise reduction of geomagnetic data from magnetic network of Mt Etna we developed an adaptive filtering. Magnetic vector data are included as input to the filter, to account for the <b>orientation</b> of the <b>disturbance</b> field. The filter is able to estimate and rectify the model parameters continuously by means of new observations, so that predictions match the observed data.

30|$|Uptake of {{aluminum}} {{can result in}} risks to human health. Aluminum {{has an effect on}} numerous biological processes in the body. The exact mechanism {{of aluminum}} toxicity is, however, not fully understood. It is considered certain that aluminum is potentially cell- and neurotoxic. [22]. Enzyme activity may be disrupted and mitochondrial function may be impaired. Aluminum may also produce oxidative stress [4]. In particular, three organ systems may be negatively affected by aluminum: the hemopoietic system, the nervous system and bones. It has also been suggested that aluminum {{may play a role in}} the occurrence of diseases such as breast cancer and Alzheimer’s dementia [22]. The only direct connections that have been shown between aluminum and disease are for hemodialysis encephalopathy, osteomalacia (softening of the bones), anemia, and aluminosis (pathological changes to the lungs) [22, 28]. Of particular importance are aluminum poisoning in the form of encephalopathy and osteomalacia. These effects may occur in patients with chronic kidney disease who are dependent upon dialysis or ingest phosphate binders containing aluminum for extended periods of time [29]. Dialysis encephalopathy 2 has been brought into connection with increased aluminum concentrations in the brain of dialysis patients. In order to adequately remove phosphate from the blood, the dialysis fluid contains an aluminum compound. The aluminum can then apparently accumulate in the body and in the brain. Patients may suffer from speech difficulties and muscle cramps brought on especially by trivalent aluminum ions, personality changes, accelerated dementia, and depressive moods [30, 31]. The skeletal system has also been suggested as a potential target of aluminum toxicity [28]. Long-term uptake of comparatively large amounts of aluminum, e.g., taking antacids 3 containing aluminum, may cause an imbalance in the calcium and phosphate household with resultant softening of the bones [32]. Substantial aluminum contamination may result in delayed bone development [31] and development of anemia. Aluminum-induced anemia is typically macrocytic and hypochromatic, 4 often occurring in dialysis patients. The exact cause of this phenomenon remains unknown [31]. Aluminosis, also referred to as “aluminum lung” is an occupational disease of workers exposed to aluminum and aluminum oxide dust and vapors. Of all aluminum-related health risks, aluminosis has been known the longest. [29]. Aluminum compounds accumulate in the lungs and impair the self-cleaning system of the lungs. In addition, they may elicit inflammatory processes that induce irreversible tissue damage to the respiratory system and the lungs, possibly resulting in fibrosis [33, 34]. Due to inadequate and disputable data, the involvement of aluminum in breast cancer and the development of Alzheimer’s disease as mentioned in the discussion can neither be explicitly substantiated or negated. Indications of a relationship between aluminum and breast cancer result from observations that breast tissue of women with tumors to some extent may exhibit higher aluminum concentrations than tissue from healthy women. It should also be noted that the disproportionate incidence of female breast cancer in the upper outer quadrant rises with year of publication, from 30.9 % in 1926 to 43 – 48 % in 1947 – 1967 and to 60.7 % in 1994 [35]. Aside from the improved diagnostic methods for cancer of the breast, the use of antitranspirants or deodorants containing aluminum may also play a role. Since these substances are applied very close to the breast tissue, they could be involved in the development of breast cancer [9]. It must be noted, however, that the data related to this are contradictory and as a consequence it is not possible to draw scientifically tenable conclusions regarding antitranspirants or deodorants containing aluminum and breast cancer. As a reaction to this controversial situation, however, aluminum-free antitranspirants have begun to appear in the market. Alzheimer’s disease is an illness characterized by disorders in cognitive areas such as memory and <b>orientation</b> <b>disturbances</b> [36]. Reports have been made of increased aluminum concentrations in certain areas of the brain [37]. As with the role that aluminum may play in the development of breast cancer, the role of aluminum in Alzheimer’s disease remains very controversial. As possible mechanism, the neurotoxic potential of aluminum and the possibility that aluminum bound to transferrin may enter the brain have been suggested. There is no evidence that aluminum may be a singular causative factor for Alzheimer’s disease, but may act as a co-factor that can abet the development of the disease [22].|$|R

These are referred to as 2 ̆ 2 pop-up structures 2 ̆ 2 in this work. The scope of this work presented the deposition of colloidal gold nanoparticles (GNPs) into conformal thin films using a microstenciling technique. Results illustrated that the gold nanoparticle deposition process can easily be integrated into current MEMS microfabrication processes. Thin films of GNPs deposited onto the surfaces of siliconbased bistable MEMS and test devices were shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the heating up of microstructures that cause them to fold. The dissertation consists of four chapters, covering details of fabrication methods, theoretical simulations, experimental work, and existing and potential applications. Chapter II illustrates how control of the folding order can generate complex three-dimensional objects from metal-oxide bilayers using this approach. By relying on the fact that narrower structures are released from the substrate first, it is possible to create multiaxis loops and interlinked objects with several sequential release steps, using a single photomask. The structures remain planar until released by dry silicon etching, making it possible to integrate them with other MEMS and microelectronic devices early in the process. Chapter III depicts the fabrication process of different types of bistable structures. It describes the principle of functioning of such structures, and simulations using CoventorWare are used to support the concept. We talk over about advantages and disadvantages of bistable structures, and discuss possible applications. Chapter IV describes fabrication procedure of nanoparticle-MEMS hybrid device. We introduce a convenient synthesis of GNPs with precisely controlled optical absorption in the NIR region by a single step reaction ofHAuCl 4 and Na 2 S 203. We take a look at different techniques to pattern gold nanoparticles on the surface of MEMS structures, and also provide a study of their thermal properties under near IR stimulation. We demonstrate the first approach of laser-driven bistable MEMS actuators for bioapplications.

40|$|Steady and {{unsteady}} two-dimensional {{free surface}} flows subjected {{to one or}} multiple disturbances are considered. Flow configurations involving either a single fluid or two layers of fluid of different but constant densities, are examined. Both the effects of gravity and surface tension are included. Fully nonlinear boundary integral equation techniques based on Cauchy’s integral formula are used to derive integro-differential equations to model the problem. The integro-differential equations are discretised and solved iteratively using Newton’s method. Both forced solitary waves and critical flow solutions, where the flow upstream is subcritical and downstream is supercritical, are obtained. The behaviour of the forced wave {{is determined by the}} Froude and Bond numbers and the <b>orientation</b> of the <b>disturbance.</b> When a second disturbance is placed upstream in the pure gravity critical case, trapped waves have been found between the disturbances. However, when surface tension is included, trapped waves are shown only to exist for very small values of the Bond number. Instead, it is shown that the disturbance must be placed downstream in the gravity-capillary case to see trapped waves. The stability of these critical hydraulic fall solutions is examined. It is shown that the hydraulic fall is stable, but the trapped wave solutions are only stable in the pure gravity case. Critical, flexural-gravity flows, where a thin sheet of ice rests on top of the fluid are then considered. The flows in the flexural-gravity and gravity-capillary cases are shown to be similar. These similarities are investigated, and the physical significance of both configurations, examined. When two fluids are considered, the situation is more complex. The rigid lid approximation is assumed, and four types of critical flow are investigated. Trapped wave solutions are found to exist in some cases, depending on the Froude number in the lower layer. ...|$|R
40|$|Virtual environments offer unique {{training}} opportunities, {{particularly for}} training astronauts and preadapting {{them to the}} novel sensory conditions of microgravity. Two unresolved human factors issues in virtual reality (VR) systems are: 1) potential "cybersickness", and 2) maladaptive sensorimotor performance following exposure to VR systems. Interestingly, these aftereffects are often quite similar to adaptive sensorimotor responses observed in astronauts during and/or following space flight. Changes in the environmental sensory stimulus conditions {{and the way we}} interact with the new stimuli may result in motion sickness, and perceptual, spatial <b>orientation</b> and sensorimotor <b>disturbances.</b> Initial interpretation of novel sensory information may be inappropriate and result in perceptual errors. Active exploratory behavior in a new environment, with resulting feedback and the formation of new associations between sensory inputs and response outputs, promotes appropriate perception and motor control in the new environment. Thus, people adapt to consistent, sustained alterations of sensory input such as those produced by microgravity, unilateral labyrinthectomy and experimentally produced stimulus rearrangements. Adaptation is revealed by aftereffects including perceptual disturbances and sensorimotor control disturbances. The purpose of the current study was to compare disturbances in postural control produced by dome and head-mounted virtual environment displays, and {{to examine the effects of}} exposure duration, and repeated exposures to VR systems. Forty-one subjects (21 men, 20 women) participated in the study with an age range of 21 - 49 years old. One training session was completed in order to achieve stable performance on the posture and VR tasks before participating in the experimental sessions. Three experimental sessions were performed each separated by one day. The subjects performed a navigation and pick and place task in either a dome or head-mounted display (HMD) VR system for either 30 or 60 min. The environment was a square room with 15 pedestals on two opposite walls. The objects appeared on one set of pedestals and the subject s objective was to move the objects to the other set of pedestals. After the subject picked up an object, a pathway appeared and they were required to follow the pathway to the other side of the room. The subject was instructed to perform the task as quickly and accurately as possible, avoiding hitting walls and other any obstacles and placing the object on the center of the pedestal. Postural equilibrium was measured (using the Equitest CDP balance system, Neurocom, International) before, immediately after, and at 1 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr and 6 hr following exposure to VR. Postural equilibrium was measured during quiet stance with eyes open, eyes closed and vision and/or ankle proprioceptive inputs selectively altered by servo-controlling the visual surround and/or support surface to the subject s center of mass sway. Posture data was normalized using a log transformation and motion sickness data were normalized using the square root. In general, we found that exposure to VR resulted in decrements in postural stability. The largest decrements were observed in the tests performed immediately following exposure to VR and showed a fairly rapid recovery across the remaining test sessions. In addition, subjects generally showed improvement across days. We found significant main effects for day and time for the composite equilibrium score and for sensory organization tests (SOT) 1, 2 and 6. Significant main effects were observed for day for SOT 3 and 5. Although we found no significant main effects for gender (when center of gravity was used as a covariate), we did observe significant gender X time interaction effects for composite equilibrium and for SOT 1, 3, 4 and 5. Women appeared to show larger decrements in postural stability immediately after exposure to VR than men, but recover more quickly than n. Finally, we found no significant main effects for type of VR device or for exposure duration, however, these factors did interact with other factors during some of the SOTs. Subjects exhibited rapid recovery of motion sickness symptoms across time following exposure to VR and significantly less severe symptoms across days. We did not observe main effects for gender, type of device or duration of exposure. Individuals recovered from the detrimental effects of exposure to virtual reality on postural control and motion sickness within one hour. Sickness severity and initial decrements in postural equilibrium decreases over days, which suggests that subjects become dual-adapted over time. These findings provide some direction for developing training schedules for VR users that facilitate adaptation, and support the idea that preflight training of astronauts may serve as useful countermeasure for the sensorimotor effects of space flight...|$|R
