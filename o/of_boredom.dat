5|$|From {{an early}} age, Reines {{exhibited}} {{an interest in}} science, and liked creating and building things. He later recalled that: The first stirrings of interest in science that I remember occurred during a moment <b>of</b> <b>boredom</b> at religious school, when, looking {{out of the window}} at twilight through a hand curled to simulate a telescope, I noticed something peculiar about the light; it was the phenomenon of diffraction. That began for me a fascination with light.|$|E
5|$|While an Australian Cattle Dog {{generally}} works silently, it will bark {{in alarm}} or to attract attention. It has a distinctive intense, high-pitched bark. Barking {{can be a}} sign <b>of</b> <b>boredom</b> or frustration, although {{research has shown that}} pet dogs increase their vocalisation when raised in a noisy environment. It responds well to familiar dogs, but when multiple dogs are present, establishing a pecking order can trigger aggression. It is not a breed that lives in a pack with other dogs.|$|E

25|$|He {{is thought}} to have coined the term, Sunday neurosis. The term refers to a form of anxiety {{resulting}} from an awareness in some people of the emptiness of their lives once the working week is over. Some complain of a void and a vague discontent. This arises from an existential vacuum, or feeling of meaninglessness, which is a common phenomenon and is characterised by the subjective state <b>of</b> <b>boredom,</b> apathy, and emptiness. One feels cynical, lacks direction, and questions the point of most of life's activities. (see noogenic neurosis).|$|E
25|$|Gigi makes a wager {{during a}} card match with Gaston, {{suggesting}} {{that if he}} loses, {{he has to take}} her grandmother and her to the sea with him when he goes on vacation. Gaston agrees, and they all travel to Trouville. While Gaston and Gigi spend countless hours having fun together, Honoré and Madame Alvarez reveal their once-passionate relationship. While other women at the resort are shown holding perfect poise constantly, and giving off an air <b>of</b> <b>boredom</b> and disdain for anything unfamiliar, Gigi is pulling Gaston out of his depressive rut with her carefree, fun attitude.|$|E
25|$|Camillo and {{his older}} brother Gustavo were {{initially}} educated at home. He was sent to the Turin Military Academy when he was only ten years old. In July 1824 he was named a page to Charles Albert, the king of Piedmont (1831–1849). Cavour frequently ran afoul of the authorities in the academy, as he was too headstrong to deal with the rigid military discipline. He was once forced to live three days on bread and water because he had been caught with books that the academy had banned. He was found to be apt at the mathematical disciplines, and was therefore enlisted in the Engineer Corps in the Piedmontese-Sardinian army in 1827. While in the army, he studied the English language as well as the works of Jeremy Bentham and Benjamin Constant, developing liberal tendencies which made him suspect to police forces at the time. He resigned his commission in the army in November 1831, both because <b>of</b> <b>boredom</b> with military life and because of his dislike of the reactionary policies of King Charles Albert. He administered the family estate at Grinzane, some forty kilometers outside the capital, serving as mayor there from 1832 to the revolutionary upheaval of 1848.|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the effects <b>of</b> visitors’ <b>boredom</b> <b>of</b> a {{destination}} on their intention to revisit it, using two Japanese popular tourism destinations as the cases. Relationships between three factors, which are satisfaction, boredom and revisit intention, were examined. In addition to the subjective index <b>of</b> visitors’ <b>boredom</b> based on ratings on a scale, the rate of remaining facilities (RoRF), which was the objective index <b>of</b> visitors’ <b>boredom,</b> is also employed. A questionnaire survey was conducted to obtain data related to the five factors. We conclude that subjective index <b>of</b> visitors’ <b>boredom</b> may not be effective for understanding of their revisit intention, while their revisit intention can arguably be relevant to the RoRF...|$|R

25|$|Work songs include music sung while {{conducting}} a task (often to coordinate timing) or a song {{linked to a}} task or trade which might be a connected narrative, description, or protest song. The two main types of work song in England are agricultural work songs, usually are rhythmic a cappella songs sung by people working on a physical and often repetitive task, like the 'Harvest song' common in south-west England. The songs were probably intended to increase productivity while reducing feelings <b>of</b> <b>boredom.</b> Rhythms of work songs can serve to synchronize physical movement in a group or gang. Industrial folk song emerged in Britain in the 18th century, as workers took the music {{with which they were}} familiar, including ballads and agricultural work songs, and adapted them to their new experiences and circumstances. Unlike agricultural work songs, it was often unnecessary to use music to synchronise actions between workers, as the pace would be increasingly determined by water, steam, chemical and eventually electric power, and frequently impossible because of the noise of early industry. As a result, industrial folk songs tended to be descriptive of work, circumstances, or political in nature, making them amongst the earliest protest songs and were sung between work shifts or in leisure hours, rather than during work. This pattern can be seen in textile production, mining and eventually steel, shipbuilding, rail working and other industries.|$|E

500|$|A few notable {{critics have}} argued that the film is vastly overrated, {{claiming}} it failed to [...] "live up to such blinding, high-wattage enthusiasm", and that there were [...] "chasms <b>of</b> <b>boredom</b> watching it", in particular [...] "the second and third acts spiraled into the expected". Other labels included [...] "preachy" [...] and [...] "too long". Child reviews sent into CBBC were mixed, some citing boredom and an inadequate storyline.|$|E

500|$|The show {{received}} a mixed reception from media publications. Some media outlets were {{more critical of}} the show. Television critic Robert Bianco of USA Today complained that the awards ceremony was [...] "intensely narcissistic and characteristically, almost unrelievedly, dull." [...] Columnist Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe bemoaned that [...] "TV's most-watched slug crawled back into town last night." [...] He also sniped, [...] "As usual, the technical awards formed a Bermuda triangle {{in the middle of}} the show, and the film-clip fests and production numbers numbed our brains." [...] The Sacramento Bees Rick Kishman lamented that [...] "It was the first time both best-acting Oscars went to African Americans...yet viewers had to fight hours and hours <b>of</b> <b>boredom</b> to care."

500|$|A 2011 {{biography}} by Pearlman {{describes a}} tumultuous personal life {{very different from}} his positive public image. According to Pearlman's biography, Payton was a consistent adulterer, and a multiple drug user.

Payton did not cope well with life after his career, especially with issues <b>of</b> <b>boredom</b> and loneliness. His wife and family contend that the book is filled with factual misstatements, and paints too bleak a picture of his life. However, many reviewers of Pearlman's work have found it to have been [...] "exhaustively" [...] researched and documented by hundreds of interviews. The ghostwriter for Payton's autobiography called the book [...] "an incredible, thoughtful, deep and profound read. It’s exceptional work." ...|$|E

She also sees Cortana as a teenage version of herself: smarter than her parents, always [...] "talking, learning, and eager to share her knowledge". Cortana is also described as having a [...] sense of humor; she often cracks jokes or wryly comments, even during combat. Her high spirits and lack of programming restrictions give her a set of behavioral [...] "quirks" [...] unique among most AI characters in the Halo universe. For example, she becomes irate and impatient when the Master Chief doubts her judgment in Halo: First Strike.|$|E

500|$|Conversely, Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said, [...] "Although {{this movie}} is {{effective}} moment to moment, very little of it lingers in the mind afterward. The ideal vehicle for our age of immediate sensation and instant gratification, it disappears without a trace {{almost as soon as}} it's consumed." [...] Scott Mendelson of Forbes said, [...] "Avengers: Age of Ultron plays like an obligation, a box to be checked off on a list before all parties move onto the things they really want to do." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote, [...] "This Avengers doesn't always pop the way that the first one sometimes did, partly because its villain isn't as memorable, despite Mr. Spader's silky threat."

500|$|Audience {{appreciation}} {{ratings were}} taken {{for the first}} two episodes of City of Death, and both episodes attained a respectable score of 64%. Listings magazine Radio Times published two letters from viewers regarding City of Death. Les Rogers of Hastings praised the serial's cast and the location filming; less impressed, however, was Paul R. Maskew of Exeter who felt the show was being played for laughs. Responding to similar criticisms from viewers, Douglas Adams wrote, [...] "If the programme didn't move and take a few risks then it would have died <b>of</b> <b>boredom</b> years ago". Several viewers wrote to point out the discrepancy between the start of life on Earth of 4,000 million years ago and the date given in City of Death of 400 million years ago. Graham Williams replied, [...] "The good Doctor makes the odd mistake or two but I think an error of 3,600 million years is pushing it! His next edition of the Encyclopedia Galactica will provide an erratum". Another viewer wrote {{to point out that the}} atmosphere of the primordial Earth would have been poisonous to the Doctor and his companions; Douglas Adams responded to this criticism, citing artistic license.|$|E
500|$|In the {{interest}} of the family, rural females are sent to find urban employment over male counterparts, mainly to supplement familial income at home and to support the males, who are more likely to attend college. The male standard of education in China is higher, particularly when a family is under financial stress, females are more likely {{to drop out of school}} to generate income for the family. Because females have lesser impact on the family's long-term financial stability, their rights for opportunities development are consequently unequal. This inequality also reinforces emotional motivations for migration. Many women migrate to find personal fulfillment. Stereotypes in China that developed as a result of globalization portray rural women as [...] "‘backward’" [...] and urban women as [...] "‘modern’". Many people associate modernity with maturity, so rural women migrate to cities to be perceived as mature. Migrant women also appreciate the knowledge they obtain (including political- and self-awareness) while living in cities. Some women even report desiring to leave villages as a result <b>of</b> <b>boredom</b> with rural life. Ideas perpetuated due to globalization simultaneously increased women's intentions to become independent; many migrant workers desire lives separate from those of their families’.|$|E

50|$|As {{well as his}} music, Eye {{is famous}} for his Dada {{influenced}} mixed-media style of art that utilises airbrush, marker pen and collage, amongst other materials. This work has adorned a number of records, including the majority <b>of</b> <b>Boredoms</b> releases and, perhaps more famously, Beck's Midnite Vultures. Similar to the Boredoms' musical direction, Eye started incorporating a much more psychedelic, calmer approach into his work, evident {{on the covers of}} many <b>of</b> the later <b>Boredoms</b> albums. Drawing as much from Japanese mythology as it does from his musical influence, such as early punk imagery, his work aims to complement the music as well as to provide another dimension to the sound.|$|R
