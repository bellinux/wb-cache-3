40|$|This work {{presents}} the tuning of drug-loaded scaffolds for bone regeneration as dual-drug delivery systems. Two therapeutic substances, zoledronic acid (anti-osteoporotic drug) and ibuprofen (antiinflammatory drug) were successfully incorporated {{in a controlled}} mannerinto three dimensional designed porous scaffolds of apatite/agarose composite. A high-performance liquid chromatography method was optimized to separate and simultaneously quantify the two drugs released from the dualdrug codelivery system. The multifunctional porous scaffolds fabricated show a very rapid delivery of anti-inflammatory (interesting to reduce inflammation after implantation), whereas the antiosteoporotic drug showed sustained release behaviour (important to promote bone regeneration). Since ibuprofen release was faster than desired, this drug was encapsulated in chitosan spheres which were then incorporated into the scaffolds, obtaining a release profile suitable for clinical application. The results obtained open the possibility to simultaneously incorporate two or more drugs to an <b>osseous</b> <b>implant</b> in a controlled way improving it for bone healing application...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of load-bearing <b>osseous</b> <b>implant</b> with desired mechanical and surface properties {{in order to}} promote incorporation with bone and to eliminate risk of bone resorption and implant failure is a very challenging task. Bone formation and resoption processes depend on the mechanical environment. Certain stress/strain conditions are required to promote new bone growth and to prevent bone mass loss. Conventional metallic implants with high stiffness carry most of the load and the surrounding bone becomes virtually unloaded and inactive. Fibre-reinforced composites offer an interesting alternative to metallic implants, because their mechanical properties can be tailored to be equal to those of bone, by the careful selection of matrix polymer, type of fibres, fibre volume fraction, orientation and length. Successful load transfer at bone-implant interface requires proper fixation between the bone and implant. One promising method to promote fixation is to prepare implants with porous surface. Bone ingrowth into porous surface structure stabilises the system and improves clinical success of the implant. The experimental part of this work was focused on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) -based composites with dense load-bearing core and porous surface. Three-dimensionally randomly orientated chopped glass fibres were used to reinforce the composite. A method to fabricate those composites was developed by a solvent treatment technique and some characterisations concerning the functionality of the surface structure were made in vitro and in vivo. Scanning electron microscope observations revealed that the pore size and interconnective porous architecture of the surface layer of the fibre-reinforced composite (FRC) could be optimal for bone ingrowth. Microhardness measurements showed that the solvent treatment did not {{have an effect on the}} mechanical properties of the load-bearing core. A push-out test, using dental stone as a bone model material, revealed that short glass fibre-reinforced porous surface layer is strong enough to carry load. Unreacted monomers can cause the chemical necrosis of the tissue, but the levels of leachable resisidual monomers were considerably lower than those found in chemically cured fibre-reinforced dentures and in modified acrylic bone cements. Animal experiments proved that surface porous FRC implant can enhance fixation between bone and FRC. New bone ingrowth into the pores was detected and strong interlocking between bone and the implant was achieved...|$|E

40|$|Bioactive {{glasses are}} {{currently}} considered the suitable candidates {{to stir the}} quest {{for a new generation of}} <b>osseous</b> <b>implants</b> with superior biological/functional performance. In congruence with this vision, this contribution aims to introduce a reliable technological recipe for coating fairly complex 3 D-shaped implants (e. g. dental screws) with uniform and mechanical resistant bioactive glass films by the radio-frequency magnetron sputtering method. The mechanical reliability of the bioactive glass films applied to real Ti dental implant fixtures has been evaluated by a procedure comprised of c̈oldïmplantation in pig mandibular bone from a dead animal, followed by immediate tension-free extraction tests. The effects of the complex mechanical strains occurring during implantation were analysed by scanning electron microscopy coupled with electron dispersive spectroscopy. Extensive biocompatibility assays (MTS, immunofluorescence, Western blot) revealed that the bioactive glass films stimulated strong cellular adhesion and proliferation of human dental pulp stem cells, without promoting their differentiation. The ability of the implant coatings to conserve a healthy stem cell pool is promising to further endorse the fabrication of new osseointegration implant designs with extended lifetime.

40|$|PURPOSE. Dental implant {{has gained}} {{clinical}} success over last decade {{with the major}} drawback related to osseointegration as properties of metal (Titanium) are different from human bone. Currently implant procedures include endosseous type of dental implants with nanoscale surface characteristics. The objective of this review article is to summarize the role of nanotopography on titanium dental implant surfaces {{in order to improve}} osseointegration and various techniques that can generate nanoscale topographic features to titanium implants. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A systematic electronic search of English language peer reviewed dental literature was performed for articles published between December 1987 to January 2012. Search was conducted in Medline, PubMed and Google scholar supplemented by hand searching of selected journals. 101 articles were assigned to full text analysis. Articles were selected according to inclusion and exclusion criterion. All articles were screened according to inclusion standard. 39 articles were included in the analysis. RESULTS. Out of 39 studies, seven studies demonstrated that bone implant contact increases with increase in surface roughness. Five studies showed comparative evaluation of techniques producing microtopography and nanotopography. Eight studies concluded that osteoblasts preferably adhere to nano structure as compared to smooth surface. Six studies illustrated that nanotopography modify implant surface and their properties. Thirteen studies described techniques to produce nano roughness. CONCLUSION. Modification of dental <b>osseous</b> <b>implants</b> at nanoscale level produced by various techniques can alter biological responses that may improve osseointegration and dental implant procedures.

40|$|Abstract. Silica aerogels have {{attracted}} increasingly more attention {{due to their}} extraordinary properties and their existing and potential applications {{in a wide variety}} of technological areas. Materials that promote bone-tissue formation at their surface and bond to <b>osseous</b> tissues when <b>implanted</b> are called bioactive, such as pseudowollastonite particles. In this work, the synthesis of aerogels with pseudowollastonite particles was performed. The synthesis involved the preparation of an alcogel by a two step sol-gel route followed by ambient pressure drying. To promote a higher bioactivity the obtained aerogels were then biomimetically treated using simulated body fluids, SBF and 1. 5 SBF. A high bioactivity was demonstrated by FT-IR, SEM, EDS, and XRD. The in vitro biocompatibility was assessed by testing cytotoxicity using rat osteoblasts cultures.

40|$|Background: Peri-implant mucositis {{defines the}} {{inflammation}} of gingival tissue surrounding <b>osseous</b> integrated <b>implants</b> without destruction of supporting bone. Untreated mucositis may develop into peri-implantitis with irreversible resorption of alveolar bone and implant failure. Mucositis is reversible with early intervention; however, existing clinical approaches have proved inadequate to reveal {{initial stages of}} this complication. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive modality that provides real time, cross-sectional optical images of tissue up to 2 - 3 mm in depth from the surface. Here, the minipig model assessed the diagnostic capability of OCT to detect early signs of mucositis by imaging microstructural changes of soft peri-implant tissue based on its correspondent histological analysis. Methods: Implants were placed in edentulous ridges of anesthetized animals. After a 7 - 8 weeks healing to achieve osseous integration, peri-implant disease was induced by ligature procedures. At endpoints of 3, 7 and 12 days after ligation, implant sites were clinically examined by bleeding on probing, probing depth, clinical attachment loss, suppuration and radiographic changes in bone level. Biopsies were collected for ex vivo optical imaging and histological analysis. Results: As early as 3 to 7 days after ligation, imaging documented the internal disarrangement of peri-implant gingival tissue and the images correlated well with corresponding histological specimens. Clinical signs of inflammation and loss of alveolar bone were absent. Conclusion: Development of clinical applications of OCT imaging for early diagnosis of mucositis could lead to therapeutic interventions to reduce one {{of the causes of}} implant failur...|$|R

Objective: The {{objective of this}} study was to assess the impact of a periodontal honors course on the educational experience and financial productivity of residents enrolled in the Advanced Education Program in Periodontology at the University of Minnesota. Methods: Data were collected during a semi-annual chart audit process conducted by the program director and appointed staff whereby treatment progress and individual procedures were tabulated for all assigned patients. Demographic data and financial productivity data for the residents was also collected. Data was analyzed for the 15 year period from 1998 - 2012 and was split in a pre-honors cohort, Cohort 1 (1998 - 2002, N= 14), and two post-honors cohorts, Cohort 2 (2003 - 2007, N= 15) and Cohort 3 (2008 - 2012, N= 16) to examine the immediate and long term effects after introducing this course. Differences in resident performance in non-surgical and surgical periodontal therapy, sedation procedures and financial productivity were studied. Results: Periodontal residents performed significantly (p < 0. 05) more non-surgical (scaling and root planing, periodontal maintenance), surgical (exodontia, <b>osseous</b> grafting, <b>implant</b> surgery, soft tissue grafting) and sedation procedures after instituting the periodontal honors course. During this 15 year period there was greater than a 600 % increase in financial productivity by the periodontal residents with the most dramatic growth occurring in the first 3 years after instituting the periodontal honors course. Conclusion: There was an overall statistically significant improvement in the clinical experience and corresponding financial productivity of the residents in the Advanced Education Program in Periodontology after introducing the periodontal honors course. Implementation of such an honors program by other disciplines and dental schools has a strong potential to improve the quality of specialty education as well as monetarily reward the residency program and the institution as a whole...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Titanium and {{titanium}} alloys {{are widely used}} for fabrication of dental implants. Since the material composition and the surface topography of a biomaterial play {{a fundamental role in}} osseointegration, various chemical and physical surface modifications have been developed to improve <b>osseous</b> healing. Zirconia-based <b>implants</b> were introduced into dental implantology as an altenative to titanium implants. Zirconia seems to be a suitable implant material because of its tooth-like colour, its mechanical properties and its biocompatibility. As the osseointegration of zirconia implants has not been extensively investigated, the aim {{of this study was to}} compare the osseous healing of zirconia implants with titanium implants which have a roughened surface but otherwise similar implant geometries. Methods Forty-eight zirconia and titanium implants were introduced into the tibia of 12 minipigs. After 1, 4 or 12 weeks, animals were sacrificed and specimens containing the implants were examined in terms of histological and ultrastructural techniques. Results Histological results showed direct bone contact on the zirconia and titanium surfaces. Bone implant contact as measured by histomorphometry was slightly better on titanium than on zirconia surfaces. However, a statistically significant difference between the two groups was not observed. Conclusion The results demonstrated that zirconia implants with modified surfaces result in an osseointegration which is comparable with that of titanium implants. </p...|$|R
40|$|At present, limited {{functional}} data exists {{regarding the}} application {{and use of}} biomechanical and imaging technologies for oral implant osseointegration assessment. The objective {{of this investigation was}} to determine the functional apparent moduli (FAMs) that could predict the dynamics of oral implant osseointegration. Using an in vivo dental <b>implant</b> <b>osseous</b> healing model, two FAMs, functional bone apparent modulus (FBAM), and composite tissue apparent modulus (FCAM), of the selected peri-implant structures were calculated via microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) and finite element (FE) simulations in order to support this concept. Results showed significant sensitivity between FAMs and micro-CT parameters, especially between bone mineral density and FBAM, while at extraction defect sites the strongest correlations existed between bone-implant contact and FCAM. Significant enhancement of FCAM indicated progressive functional repair during early osseointegration. Further, the resultant interfacial resistance was predicted by bone mineral content (BMC) and FBAM within a ∼ 200 Μm peri-implant thickness, while the extraction defects gave zones of ∼ 575 Μm and 200 Μm for BMC and FCAM, respectively. These results suggest that the function of dental implant support can be predicted from a peri-implant structural zone. We conclude that FAMs can be used to predict the dynamics of dental implant osseointegration in vivo. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part B: Appl Biomater, 201...|$|R

40|$|AB Objectives: Bone rivets were {{developed}} {{as an alternative}} method to fasten plates during internal fixation of fractures when screw anchorage may be inadequate. This study examined whether such rivets allow proper fracture healing without eliciting adverse bone remodelling and whether they can be removed safely. Methods: A proximal diaphyseal fracture of the tibia was stabilized with a conventional plate (low-contact dynamic compression plate, Synthes) in 10 sheep. The distal fragment was anchored using bicortical screws, and the proximal fragment (1 - 2. 5 mm thick cortex) with 3 rivets following screw stripping. Postoperative care included immediate weight bearing and biweekly radiographs. After 12 weeks, implants were removed from 6 sheep and the tibial strength measured. Tibiae with empty and filled rivet holes (at 12 and 24 weeks) were examined histologically. Results: In all sheep, secondary bone healing was observed without length and angulation deformities. All fracture gaps were bridged and filled with new bone. The average torsional strength after 12 weeks was 75 +/- 11 % of the intact tibia (mean +/- SD), and failure never occurred through an empty rivet hole. After 12 weeks, there was intensive cortical remodelling at the rivets correlating with slight to moderate nonprogressive periosteal radiolucency around 55 % of the rivets. However, there was also endosteal appositional bone growth at 85 % of the rivets. There was no observable macroscopic or microscopic <b>osseous</b> damage after <b>implant</b> removal. After 24 weeks, remodelling activity had decreased and was noted only sporadically.

40|$|Objectives To assess {{differences}} in marginal bone loss around implants placed in maxillary pristine bone and implants placed following maxillary sinus augmentation {{over a period}} of 3  years after functional loading. Material and methods Two cohorts of subjects (Group 1 : Subjects who received sinus augmentation with simultaneous implant placement; Group 2 : Subjects who underwent conventional implant placement in posterior maxillary pristine bone) were included in this retrospective study. Radiographic marginal bone loss was measured around one implant per patient on digitized panoramic radiographs that were obtained at the time of prosthesis delivery (baseline) and 12, 24, and 36  months later. The influence of age, gender, smoking habits, history of periodontal disease, and type of prosthetic connection (internal or external) on marginal bone loss was analyzed in function of the type of osseous support (previously grafted or pristine). Results A total of 105 subjects were included in this study. Cumulative radiographic marginal bone loss ranged from 0  mm to 3. 9  mm after 36  months of functional loading. There were statistically significant {{differences in}} marginal bone loss between implants placed in grafted and pristine bone at the 12 ‐month assessment, but not in the subsequent progression rate. External prosthetic connection, smoking, and history of periodontitis negatively influenced peri‐implant bone maintenance, regardless of the type of <b>osseous</b> substrate. Conclusions <b>Implants</b> placed in sites that received maxillary sinus augmentation exhibited more marginal bone loss than implants placed in pristine bone, although marginal bone loss mainly occurred during the first 12  months after functional loading.

40|$|Statement of problem: complete-arch restorations {{supported}} by fewer than 5 dental implants can induce unbalanced load transfer and tissue overloading, leading to excessive bone resorption and possible clinical failure. This is primarily {{affected by the}} cantilever length, the implant design and positioning, and the morphology and properties of the bone. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare 2 different restorative techniques for complete-arch rehabilitations {{supported by}} 4 implants. The primary purpose was to highlight the possible risks of excessive stress and unbalanced load transfer mechanisms and to identify the main biomechanical factors affecting loading transmission. Material and methods: Three-dimensional (3 D) numerical models of edentulous maxillae and mandibles restored with 2 techniques using 4 implants were generated from computed tomography (CT) images and analyzed with linear elastic finite-element simulations with 3 different static loads. The first technique used 2 vertical mesial implants and 2 tilted distal implants (at a 30 degree angle), and the second used vertical implants that fulfilled platform switching concepts. Bone-muscle interactions and temporomandibular joints were included in the mandibular model. Complete <b>implant</b> <b>osseous</b> integration was assumed and different posthealing crestal bone geometries were modeled. Stress measures (revealing risks of tissue overloading) and a performance index (highlighting the main features of the loading partition mechanisms) were introduced and computed to compare the 2 techniques. Results: Dissimilar load transfer mechanisms of the 2 restorative approaches when applied in mandibular and maxillary models were modeled. Prostheses supported by distally tilted implants exhibited a more effective and uniform loading partition than all vertical implants, except in the simulated maxilla under a frontal load. Tilted distal implants reduced compressive states at distal bone-implant interfaces but, depending on bone morphology and loading type, could induce high tensile stresses at distal crests. Overloading risks on mesial periimplant bone decreased when the efficient preservation of the crestal bone through platform switching strategies was modeled. Conclusions: Numerical simulations highlighted that the cantilever length, the implant design and positioning, and the bone's mechanical properties and morphology can affect both load transmission mechanisms and bone overloading risks in complete-arch restorations supported by 4 implants. Distally tilted implants induced better loading transmission than vertical implants, although the levels of computed stress were physiologically acceptable in both situations...|$|R
40|$|Survival {{and success}} rates of dental <b>osseous</b> <b>implants</b> are well {{documented}} and are recorded exceeding a 90 % rate for an observation period {{of more than}} 15 years. This long-term predictability combined with high safety levels for the treatment concept explains continuous growth of lists for indications. Various local and also systemic disorders which had been considered as absolute contra-indications a decade ago are meanwhile widely accepted being temporary. Cases sufferring from severe loss of alveolar bone without any possibility of an implant installation will become now augmented in defficient areas regularly by means of Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR), transplantation of autogenous bone, etc. for creating an adaquate recipient site for an implant placement. These extended treatment modalities {{gave rise to a}} whole research branch investigating bone cell biology and bone metabolism. Various grafting materials are considered suitable for bone regenerating purposes in defficient sites. Among all materials available a search for best performing combination appears likely to further improve the outcomes of the technique and the prognosis of endsseous implants. Therefore a new cross-linked collagen membrane has been evaluated clinically and histologically when combined with Deproteinized Bovine Bone Mineral (DBBM) for augmenting alveolar ridge defects prior to implant installation. Almost uneventful healing of the soft tissues in the area of membrane protected grafting was observed clinically. The collagen membrane we used in the test group prooved suitable barrier properties and no visible signs of an inflammatory reaction were detectable in case of dehiscent healing associated with membrane exposure. Furthemore none of these dehisced sites requested a premature surgical intervention, all areas exposed healed via secondary epithelization without exception within 2 to 4 weeks. The integration rate of a collagen membrane into soft tissues is considered to express the grade of biocompatibility. According to our data from an in vitro experiment this property of a collagen device is secondary to characterizing its function. Osteoblasts placed on top of different membranes without any contact to the medium received nutritional support only via diffusion across membrane material. The results demonstrated similar differentiation pattern of cells after 21 days of culture in this in vitro study for all experimental conditions and for controls. A randomized controlled trial revealed similar amounts of appositionally formed bone around granules of bone substitute in both, the test group using the collagen membrane and the control group using ePTFE membranes considered the gold standard in bone augmentation, respectively. The ePTFE membranes are known to develop severe inflammatory reaction due to massive accumulation of plaque in case of soft tissue dehiscency. This inflammatory process can jeopardize the result of augmentation procedure in general. The combination of DBBM and the new cross linked collagen membrane we suggested to use without any additives of autogenous bone due to outstanding osteoconductive properties of the substitute, thus conducting simplification of the augmenting procedure in general. Besides the quality of newly gained mineralized tissue, the three dimensional stability of the area augmented is crutial for implant installation in a two stage approach. In a one stage approach an exposed implant surface will be augmented subsequently to implant placement. The predictability of osseous integration on such an exposed area is crutial to long term stability and function of this implant. The remodeling of newly generated mineralized tissue after implants become loaded finally determines the outcome of augmentation procedure. We monitored such remodeling process recording clinical parameters and assessing marker levels for bone metabolism and inflammatory reaction in the peri-implant crevicular fluid obtained at implants inserted in previously augmented areas. Comparing these parameters with the levels obtained in natural contralateral dentition in the same group of patients, the results did not differ statistically significant between teeth and implants being loaded during past three years in 22 patients. All patients included were suffering from generalized chronic periodontitis and underwent periodontal treatment followed by periodontal supportive therapy program within the Department of Periodontology. Thus, documenting good compliance and high level of oral hygiene, these patients are facing highly predictable stability of remaining attachment apparatus and of the implants integrated. Nevertheless, clinical signs of gingival and periodontal inflammation are not sensitive enough to tacle an inflammatory onset at early stages. Therefore the analyses of pre-clinically reacting inflammatory markers and especially of Calprotectin in the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) gives a chance to assess an increasing activity of neutrophile granulocytes. Known to be a first defense row in the host response cascade, an increase in granulocyte’s activity reflected by increased levels of Calprotectin in the GCF may be helpful in determining earliest stages of inflammatory reaction. To validate the correlation between Calprotectin levels detected in the GCF and myeloperixidase activity – an enzyme considered characteristic for neutrophile granulocytes – a longitudinal assessment of both compartments has been conducted. The correlation co-efficients we could discover supported our thesis that Calprotectin levels assessed in the GCF are mainly related to granulocytes which had been activated by increasing levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines thus secreting increased amounts of the protein. Future studies have to confirm the validity and predictability of this parameter in greater cohorts longitudinally. There is a chair side test for determination of Calprotectin level in faecis for assessment of relapse in Morbus Crohn disease available. A similar chair side test for longitudinal monitoring of periodontally involved patients during supportive periodontal therapy may contribute to improving the diagnostic tools we currently aware of. The risk to develop a peri-implantitis is constantly increasing as the numbers of implants inserted are increasing annually. Even though we could demonstrate the stability of augmented bone in an uninflamed environment, in case of persisting inflammation not only augmented regions will become affected, but original peri-implant alveolar bone will suffer destructive processes. Such persisting inflammation is associated with peri-implant infection and consecutive contamination of implant surface with microorganisms similar to those known to have part in onset of periodontitis. These affected implant surfaces are very difficult to debride and to decontaminate and they suffer from peri-implantitis if bone areas are involved. Re-osseointegration of such exposed surfaces with newly created bone-to-implant contacts is an absolute goal in terms of peri-implantitis treatment. Recent animal experiments show first successful steps in achieving re-osseointegration. Rough implant surfaces are the most difficult areas to treat with a predictable outcome. The surface oblation by means of an Er:YAG laser beam {{is one of the most}} promising options among various treatment strategies. The laser energy evaporates the cooling fluid on the implant surface without affecting the surface itself. The re-attachment of osteoblasts demonstrated in vitro indicated that Er:YAG laser could effectively debride adherent microorganisms from contaminated implant surfaces and sufficiently decontaminated it from the toxins under optimized application conditions for the laser beam. The optimized conditions for the application of a laser beam request a perpendicular access to the surface to be treated. Therefore the clinical implementation of this method may be limited since peri-implant infrabony defects are usually narrow and rather cercumferential to the round diameter of an implant. Although first clinical cases with appropriate defect morphology turned to be successful there is no case controlled or randomized controlled study currently available. Further research efforts should focus at the optimization of bone substitutes and their osseoconductive and –inductive properties, taking also in consideration the development of degradable slow release devices containing binding potentials for bioactive molecules. These research activities may contribute to the field of bone augmentation as well as to the efficacy improvement in strategies managing peri-implantitis in future...|$|R
