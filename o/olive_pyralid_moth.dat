50|$|The Pyralidae, {{commonly}} called <b>pyralid</b> <b>moths,</b> snout moths or grass moths, are {{a family of}} Lepidoptera in the ditrysian superfamily Pyraloidea. In many (particularly older) classifications, the grass moths (Crambidae) {{are included in the}} Pyralidae as a subfamily, making the combined group one of the largest families in the Lepidoptera. The latest review by Eugene G. Munroe & Solis, in Kristensen (1999) retains the Crambidae as a full family of Pyraloidea.|$|R
50|$|This {{plant is}} a {{subshrub}} growing up to a meter tall. It {{is the only}} hermaphroditic species among genus Schiedea; it is likely the plant's ancestors were gynodioecious, with some all-female flowers and the others bisexual. The flowers have green sepals and no petals. The flowers have a sweet fragrance during certain times of the day. <b>Pyralid</b> <b>moths</b> can commonly {{be found on the}} flowers. They are probably also pollinated by the wind.|$|R
40|$|Hemolymph {{coagulation}} stops {{bleeding and}} protects against infection. Clotting factors include both proteins that are conserved during evolution {{as well as}} more divergent proteins in different species. Here we show that several silk proteins also appear in the clot of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella. RT-PCR analysis reveals that silk proteins are expressed in immune tissues and induced upon wounding in both Galleria and Ephestia kuehniella, a second <b>pyralid</b> <b>moth.</b> Our results support the idea that silk proteins were co-opted for immunity and coagulation during evolution...|$|R
50|$|Parasitoids and parasites of Polistes metricus tend {{to affect}} the colony at {{different}} stages in their development. It {{has been shown that}} C. pegasalis is able to infect a colony at any stage except the egg stage. C. pegasalis prefers to infect colonies that have larvae and pupae. X. peckii is similar because it prefers to parasitize larvae and pupae. In contrast, X. peckii can infect any stage of development.Infestations of Xenos parasites happen frequently in Georgia.Another parasite of P. metricus is the <b>pyralid</b> <b>moth,</b> Chalcoela iphitalis.|$|R
40|$|Field {{trials were}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the use of the pheromone (9 Z, 12 E) -tetradecadienyl acetate (TDA/ZETA) for mating disruption (MD) of Pyralidae moths associated with stored products, in most cases the Raisin moth, Ephestia cautella (Walker), Mediterranean flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella Zeller and Indianmeal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Hubner). The experiments were conducted in the Czech Republic, Greece and Italy during 2007 and 2008 in storage facilities that varied in their size and type, and included flour mills, retail stores, storage rooms with currants and raw grain stores. After a summer pre-treatment monitoring period to assess moth population in, dispensers containing TDA were placed in the fall. Adjacent facilities without dispensers were used as control units. Pheromone-baited traps were used to monitor the population fluctuation of the <b>pyralid</b> <b>moths</b> during the entire experimental periods. The presence of MD dispensers notably reduced the number of adults found in the traps in comparison with control rooms. Monitoring of female oviposition, measured as number of hatched larvae in cups containing food, indicated that there was a {{reduction in the number of}} larvae in the areas with MD dispensers. The results of the present work indicate that the use of mating disruption is feasible against <b>pyralid</b> <b>moths</b> in storage facilities, and should be further evaluated as a component of an integrated pest management based control strategy...|$|R
40|$|Over 300 {{species of}} insect (including Collembola) are {{recorded}} from Svalbard. These include 11 species of Lepidoptera, {{the majority of}} which are occasional summer immigrants (Coulson and Refseth 2003). Those for which locality data are available are summarised in Table 1. It {{has been suggested that}} Apamea maillardi (Geyer, 1834) [=zeta (Duponchel, 1854) (Mikkola and Goater 1988) ] and Plutella xylostella (L., 1758) may be resident (Kaisila 1973) but no overwintering stages have yet been found. Here we report large numbers of the <b>pyralid</b> <b>moth,</b> Pyla fusca Haworth, 1811, in late July 2002 on Ossiansarsfjellet and suggest that a resident colony is established...|$|R
5|$|Predators may {{identify}} their prey by sound {{as well as}} sight; mimics have accordingly evolved to deceive the hearing of their predators. Bats are nocturnal predators that rely on echolocation to detect their prey. Some potential prey are unpalatable to bats, and produce an ultrasonic aposematic signal, the auditory equivalent of warning coloration. In response to echolocating red bats and big brown bats, tiger moths such as Cycnia tenera produce warning sounds. Bats learn to avoid the harmful moths, but similarly avoid other species such as some <b>pyralid</b> <b>moths</b> that produce such warning sounds as well. Acoustic mimicry complexes, both Batesian and Müllerian, may be widespread in the auditory world.|$|R
50|$|Some {{lepidopteran}} species exhibit symbiotic, phoretic, or parasitic lifestyles, inhabiting {{the bodies}} of organisms rather than the environment. Coprophagous <b>pyralid</b> <b>moth</b> species, called sloth moths, such as Bradipodicola hahneli and Cryptoses choloepi, are unusual {{in that they are}} exclusively found inhabiting the fur of sloths, mammals found in Central and South America.Two species of Tinea moths have been recorded as feeding on horny tissue and have been bred from the horns of cattle. The larva of Zenodochium coccivorella is an internal parasite of the coccid Kermes species. Many species have been recorded as breeding in natural materials or refuse such as owl pellets, bat caves, honeycombs or diseased fruit.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Nerve impulses {{recorded}} from 50 /»m long pheromone sensitive olfactory sensilla in a <b>pyralid</b> <b>moth</b> {{have been}} found to consist of a single positive phase, in contrast to the usually reported biphasic pulses. The demonstration that such impulses are not necessarily biphasic discounts hypotheses which invoke active propagation of nerve impulses along the dendrite. The association of monophasic impulses with short sensilla and biphasic impulses with longer and thicker sensilla lends support to the suggestion that observed biphasic impulses owe their origin to passive electrical properties of the sensillum. The alternative possibility that some reported biphasic impulses may in fact be artefacts brought about by electrical filtering in the recording equipment of the signal is discussed...|$|R
25|$|Several {{natural enemies}} {{can reduce the}} {{population}} of the insects on hosts. Of all the predators, insects seem {{to be the most important}} group. Insects and their larvae such as <b>pyralid</b> <b>moths</b> (order Lepidoptera), which destroy the cactus, and predators such as lady bugs (Coleoptera), various Diptera (such as Syrphidae and Chamaemyiidae), lacewings (Neuroptera), and ants (Hymenoptera) have been identified, as well as numerous parasitic wasps. Many birds, human-commensal rodents (especially rats) and reptiles also prey on cochineal insects. In regions dependent on cochineal production, pest control measures are taken seriously. For small-scale cultivation, manual methods of control have proved to be the safest and most effective. For large-scale cultivation, advanced pest control methods have to be developed, including alternative bioinsecticides or traps with pheromones.|$|R
40|$|This paper summarises the {{achievements}} of a multidisciplinary Bioinformatics project which has the objective of providing a general mechanism for efficient computerisation of typewritten/hand-annotated archive card indexes, of the type found in most museums, archives and libraries. In addition to efficiently scanning, recognising and databasing {{the content of the}} cards, the original card images must be maintained as the ultimate source record, and a flexible database structure is required to allow taxonomists to reorganise and update the resulting online archive. Implementation mechanisms for each part of the overall system are described, and conversion performance for a demonstrator database of 27, 578 <b>Pyralid</b> <b>moth</b> archive cards is reported. The system is currently being used to convert the full NHM archive of Lepidoptera totalling 290, 886 cards...|$|R
