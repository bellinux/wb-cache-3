Eventually, the two sides are forced into talking and think of a resolution: using the school to house prisoners from the overcrowded prison system, thus generating money and returning the school to normal.|$|E

5|$|At least 20 {{publishers}} {{rejected the}} book before Geisel ran {{into an old}} college classmate, who had just become juvenile editor at Vanguard Press. Vanguard agreed to publish the book, and it met with high praise from critics upon release, though sales were not as impressive. Later analyses of the book have focused on its connections to Geisel's childhood; the street of the title is probably named after a street in Geisel's hometown <b>of</b> <b>Springfield,</b> Massachusetts. Geisel returned to fictionalized versions <b>of</b> <b>Springfield</b> in later books, and Marco appeared again in 1947 in the Dr. Seuss book McElligot's Pool.|$|E

5000|$|As <b>of</b> 2011, <b>Springfield's</b> skyline {{features}} relatively fewer skyscrapers {{than most}} of its peer cities. The reason for {{this has to do}} with the 1908 construction <b>of</b> <b>Springfield's</b> neo-classical 1200 Main Street building, also known as 101 State Street. The building stands at 125 ft, which, at the time of its construction, caused great controversy in both Springfield and Boston because of its [...] "extreme height." [...] That year, the Massachusetts State Legislature set a maximum height for buildings in Springfield - at 125 ft - the height of 1200 Main Street, and also the height of Court Square's Old First Church's steeple. The only exception to this law was made for the construction <b>of</b> <b>Springfield's</b> landmark, 300 ft, Italianate, Campanile - part <b>of</b> the <b>Springfield</b> Municipal Group, dedicated in 1913 by President William Howard Taft.|$|R

5|$|The Simpsons is an American {{animated}} sitcom {{created by}} Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series is a satirical depiction of working-class life, epitomized by the Simpson family, {{which consists of}} Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie.

5000|$|The Liberty Heights {{neighborhood}} comprises smaller Springfield, Massachusetts neighborhoods including Hungry Hill, Lower Liberty Heights, and Atwater Park and {{is located}} in the northwest quadrant of the city, beginning about one mile north <b>of</b> <b>Springfield's</b> Metro Center.

Its principal boundaries are Chicopee to the north; the Boston & Albany Railroad to the south; St. James Avenue to the east; and portions of Chestnut Street, Cass Street, and Jardine Street to the west.|$|R
50|$|Historical texts often {{state that}} the Chicopee River flows into the Connecticut River at Springfield, Massachusetts; however, in 1848, the City of Chicopee was carved out <b>of</b> <b>Springfield's</b> {{northern}} neighborhoods. Essentially, certain factions that opposed Springfield becoming a chartered city, and adopting the mayoral-style government such a change would entail, hatched the plan to create Chicopee {{with the idea of}} slicing off 2/5 <b>of</b> <b>Springfield's</b> population, thereby making it a place with too few people to become a legally chartered city. The plan succeeded and thus, from Springfield, came Chicopee. Ironically however, Springfield became a city only four years later - and Chicopee not long after that, with the split only serving to further fragment a region composed of - by United States standards - municipalities of small land area. Regardless, today the Chicopee River finds its confluence with the Connecticut River 0.5 mi north <b>of</b> <b>Springfield's</b> northern border, in Chicopee - not Springfield.|$|R
