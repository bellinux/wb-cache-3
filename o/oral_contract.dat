40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{consider}} the implications of the admission of <b>oral</b> <b>contracts</b> to statutory adjudication proceedings. A major criticism of the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 (“HGCRA 1996 ”) was that Section 107 required contracts to be “in writing” for the parties to be able to use statutory adjudication. In response, the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 repealed Section 107 of the HGCRA 1996. This paper considers the implications of the admission of <b>oral</b> <b>contracts</b> to statutory adjudication proceedings, whereby adjudicators’ may now have to determine the exact nature of oral agreements. The critical literature review has highlighted that there is a perceived risk that, by allowing <b>oral</b> <b>contracts</b> to be decided through adjudication, there could be an increased risk of injustice (as the adjudicator may have to decide <b>oral</b> testimony about <b>contract</b> formation).

50|$|A {{key point}} of {{controversy}} was {{whether or not}} a contract requires a written memorial to be binding. The CISG allows for a sale to be oral or unsigned, but in some countries, contracts are not valid unless written.

2500|$|Typically, {{contracts}} are oral or written, but written contracts have typically been preferred in common law legal systems; [...] in 1677 England passed the Statute of Frauds which influenced similar statute of frauds {{laws in the}} United States and other countries such as Australia. In general, the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in the United States requires a written contract for tangible product sales in excess of $500, and real estate {{contracts are}} required to be written. If the contract is not {{required by law to}} be written, an <b>oral</b> <b>contract</b> is valid and therefore legally binding. The United Kingdom has since replaced the original Statute of Frauds, but written contracts are still required for various circumstances such as land (through the Law of Property Act 1925).|$|E

[...] Strom continued to have difficulties with Nucatola {{over the next several months}} and finally sought the assistance of Richie Phillips, a Philadelphia attorney and NBA player representative. Strom filed a $275,000 suit against the NBA in December 1972 for breach of an <b>oral</b> <b>contract</b> when John Nucatola told Strom that he could return to the league. The league filed preliminary objections to have the suit dismissed, but were overruled by the court. The NBA then moved for summary judgment which was denied. Concerned that there could be legitimate action taken, the NBA decided to give Strom his job back if he dropped the suit. Strom agreed to the terms and signed a contract before the start of the 1973–74 NBA season.|$|E

In early November, Narendra emailed Zuckerberg saying, “We’re very deep into developing a site which we would like you {{to be a part of}} and ... which we know will make some waves on campus.” Within days, Zuckerberg was talking to the HarvardConnection team and preparing to take over programming duties from Gao. On the evening of November 25, 2003, the Winklevosses and Narendra met with Zuckerberg in the dining hall of Harvard's Kirkland House, where they explained to Zuckerberg the HarvardConnection website, the plan to expand to other schools after launch, the confidential nature of the project, and the importance of getting there first.

2500|$|In 1930, Secretary of the Interior Ray Lyman Wilbur, Attorney General William D. Mitchell, and Secretary of Agriculture Arthur M. Hyde {{arranged}} for the Marines to construct a separate camp for members of Hoover's cabinet, [...] downriver from the President's camp. The Cabinet Camp was built on land planned for incorporation into Shenandoah National Park, but still privately owned by the Madison Timber Corporation. No lease was signed, and a dispute arose about whether the Cabinet members had an <b>oral</b> <b>contract</b> with Madison Timber to construct the camp. Marines escorted timbermen off the property [...] "by {{the seat of the}} pants," [...] and Madison Timber was assessed property taxes for road and building improvements to which the Marines prohibited access. The conflict was covered in Time magazine, the Associated Press, and Madison Eagle newspaper. In 1931, the Ward-Rue Lumber Company filed a claim that it owned the property. Under the eventual settlement, cabinet members were allowed to use the camp throughout the Hoover administration, and the property owner resumed custody once Hoover left office. The National Park Service ran out of park expansion funds before purchasing the Cabinet Camp. The rising value of the property once the road and camp were constructed likely led the state to purchase cheaper park expansion land elsewhere.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, ConnectU filed {{a lawsuit}} against Facebook alleging that creator Mark Zuckerberg had broken an <b>oral</b> <b>contract</b> with them. The suit alleged that Zuckerberg had copied their idea and {{illegally}} used source code intended for the website he was hired to create. Facebook countersued in regards to Social Butterfly, a project put out by The Winklevoss Chang Group, an alleged partnership between ConnectU and i2hub, another campus service. It named among the defendants ConnectU, Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, Divya Narendra, Winston Williams, and Wayne Chang, founder of i2hub. A settlement agreement for both cases was reached in February 2008, reportedly valued at $65 million. [...] However, in May 2010, it was reported that ConnectU is accusing Facebook of securities fraud on the value of the stock {{that was part of the}} settlement and wants to get the settlement undone. [...] According to ConnectU's allegations, the value of the stock was worth $11 million instead of $45 million that Facebook presented at the time of settlement. [...] This meant the settlement value, at the time, was $31 million, instead of the $65 million. On August 26, 2010, The New York Times reported that Facebook shares were trading at $76 per share in the secondary market, putting the total settlement value at close to $120 million. If the lawsuit to adjust the settlement to match the difference goes through, the value will quadruple to over $466 million. According to Steven M. Davidoff, [...] "Facebook never represented its valuation in this negotiation, and so there is no prior statement that the company needs to correct."

50|$|In general, <b>oral</b> <b>{{contract}}s</b> {{are just}} as valid as written ones, but some jurisdictions either require a contract to be in writing in certain circumstances (for example where real property is being conveyed), or that a contract be evidenced in writing (although the contract itself may be oral).

50|$|An <b>oral</b> <b>contract</b> is a contract, {{the terms}} {{of which have been}} agreed by spoken communication. This is in {{contrast}} to a written contract, where the contract is a written document.

30|$|Lastly, {{a related}} {{issue is the}} extent of informality of {{employment}} relationships, {{as well as a}} proportion of written versus <b>oral</b> <b>contracts</b> in an economy.

Thus, the effective EPL coverage would be even lower in these countries, depressing the aggregate role of EPL even further.|$|R
30|$|Women {{are more}} likely to have {{contract}} jobs than men and they tend to have written rather than <b>oral</b> <b>contracts</b> compared to men. Only 19.6 % of women accept to work without contract, against a share of 21.8 % in the case of men. About 65 % of women work under a written contract against 43.6 % of men. One possibility might be that women tend to be more “risk averse” in terms of labor market experience and contract jobs may be thought to provide better maternity leave benefits and other forms of assistance compared to non-contract jobs or jobs based on <b>oral</b> <b>contracts</b> only. In addition, women tend to choose jobs in the state sector, where legal arrangements are naturally more binding. In addition, about 25 % of employed women in the sample have a job in the state sector; as a result, there are of course fewer women in the private sector. Women are also likely to be found in larger firms: 32.1 % of women work in firms with more than 20 employees against a share three times smaller of men. If women are indeed more risk averse, one possibility is that smaller firms are perceived to provide lower job security.|$|R
