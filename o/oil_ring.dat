40|$|With the {{increasing}} interest in decreasing {{the environmental impact}} from internal combustion engines as well as increasing the fuel efficiency has led to deeper investigation into {{the components of the}} engine. The mechanical friction in an engine is a major concern, any improvements or reductions in friction can have large implication on the' efficiency of the engines. This thesis focuses on the piston/ ring pack assembly and its contribution to friction. It investigates several key components and trends in friction for the piston/ ring pack assembly, specifically the trends related to the <b>oil</b> control <b>ring</b> and the liner surface. The Floating Liner Engine is used in this study to isolate results from different components. The data collected can be used for comparative analysis and to identify trends in the friction trace. The thesis starts with describing the Floating Liner Engine system at MIT in detail. Both the data collection and the hardware systems are described as well as the test capabilities of the Floating Liner Engine. The results used in the thesis have been collected using the motoring condition. The <b>oil</b> control <b>ring</b> {{plays a key role in}} controlling the supply of oil to the top two rings and hence has a higher tension that the top two rings. This leads to the <b>oil</b> control <b>ring</b> having a significant contribution to the total friction of the system. The two most prevalent <b>oil</b> control <b>rings</b> used in the industry are the twin land <b>oil</b> control <b>ring</b> (TLOCR) and the three piece <b>oil</b> control <b>ring</b> (TPOCR). The thesis investigates the effect of changing liner roughness on the friction of the TLOCR. A comparison between the TLOCR and the TPOCR is also performed using the same liner surfaces. The results from these studies show a marked difference between the friction traces from the two <b>oil</b> control <b>rings.</b> by Sarthak Vaish. Thesis: S.

40|$|Twin-land <b>oil</b> control <b>ring</b> {{is widely}} used in the {{automotive}} diesel engines, and is gaining more and more applications in the modern designs of gasoline engines. Its interaction with the cylinder liner surface accounts for around 10 % of the total frictional losses within an internal combustion engine, and {{is the most important}} factor that affects the lubricant oil consumption. A twin-land <b>oil</b> control <b>ring</b> model is developed based on the deterministic hydrodynamic method by Li et al. [31] and the Greenwood Tripp asperity contact model [39]. Unlike the traditional methods of piston ring pack modeling determined by the ring face macro profile which hardly exists on the twin-land <b>oil</b> control <b>ring,</b> the model considers the liner finish micro geometry, and uses a correlation method to predict the behavior of the ring liner interaction in both frictions losses and oil control. The model is used to study the effect of some key design parameters of the twin-land <b>oil</b> control <b>ring,</b> including the unit load pressure, the ring tension and the ring axial land width. The results show a large potential of the model in the optimization of the twin-land <b>oil</b> control <b>ring</b> design. Although many non-conventional cylinder liner finishes are now being developed to reduce friction and oil consumption, the effects of surface finish on ring-pack performance is not well understood. To solver this mystery, the twin-land <b>oil</b> control <b>ring</b> model and Li's deterministic hydrodynamic model are used to study the effect of the liner finish micro geometry. Several key parameters of liner finish texture are examined, and the analytical results show important effects of some of these key parameters on the twin-land <b>oil</b> control <b>ring</b> friction losses as well as the lubricant oil control. (cont.) These key parameters include the surface wavelength of the plateau part, the frequency of deep valleys and the honing cross-hatch angle.

40|$|Practical {{challenges}} from both experiment and calculation sides were discussed for determining two piece twin land <b>oil</b> control <b>ring</b> friction. A floating liner engine {{was used for}} twin land <b>oil</b> control <b>ring</b> study. Effects of floating liner engine system dynamics and piston skirt friction were addressed and methods to mitigate them were discussed. A deterministic twin land <b>oil</b> control <b>ring</b> model was used for ring friction calculation. Variation of the surface roughness at different spots of the liner {{and its effects on}} both hydrodynamic and boundary lubrication predictions were discussed. A multi-point correlation method was introduced to address surface variation effects on the twin land <b>oil</b> control <b>ring</b> model. Ring land width variation between two lands as well as along the circumference and its effects on calculation were shown, and methods to address it were discussed. By taking all these necessary steps in both experiments and calculations, this study shows that a reasonable match can be achieved between the measured and calculated friction, which covers all three lubrication regimes. This study lays a foundation for realistically predicting the friction of piston rings in internal com-bustion engines...|$|R

50|$|The {{engine block}} {{is made from}} high {{pressure}} die-cast aluminum which results in considerable weight savings - the entire engine with a manual gearbox only weighs 82.4 kg. The main block features a ladder frame construction for structural stiffness while its cylinders are fitted with cast-iron liners for improved abrasion durability. Additional weight was shaved off by integrating the engine support bracket with the timing chain cover. The shape of the piston skirt was optimized to reduce its size while the compression height of the piston was also reduced, resulting in weight savings. The optimized piston skirt is also treated with molybdenum disulfide. A highly sophisticated process of Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) is used to apply an ultra-thin layer of Chromium Nitride to the piston’s <b>oil</b> <b>ring.</b> Chromium Nitride-coated piston rings using PVD is an innovative technology borrowed from the Hyundai Tau engine introduced earlier. Friction between the <b>oil</b> <b>ring</b> and cylinder wall has been further minimized by reducing the <b>oil</b> <b>ring</b> tension. The Kappa engine is the first Hyundai engine to be fitted with an accessory drive belt which {{does not require a}} mechanical auto-tensioning adjustment device, reducing the hardware and further lowering weight and cost. Because it is designed to maintain an ideal tension setting, the belt runs quieter and with proper preventative maintenance and care, the belt will last 100,000 mi/160,000 km. For ignition, the Kappa engine uses a new, longer reach spark plug which enabled engineers to enlarge the size of the water jacket to promote more efficient engine cooling around the critically important spark plug and exhaust port area. The long reach spark plug (M12 thread) also enabled engineers to enlarge the valve diameter for increased airflow and combustion efficiency. A lightweight, heat-resistant engineering plastic was used for the intake manifold. The fuel delivery pipe assembly is a returnless type (to eliminate evaporative fuel emissions) and is made of SUS (steel use stainless) with a specially designed inner structure for the reduction of pulsation noise.|$|E
5000|$|Piston {{rings are}} subject to wear as they {{move up and down}} the {{cylinder}} bore due to their own inherent load and due to the gas load acting on the ring. To minimize this, they are made of wear-resistant materials, such as cast iron and steel, and are coated or treated to enhance the wear resistance. Two-stroke port design is critical to ring life. Newer modern motorcycle manufacturers have many single function but serrated ports to retain the ring. Typically, top <b>ring</b> and <b>oil</b> control <b>rings</b> will be coated with chromium, or Nitrided, possibly plasma sprayed [...] or have a PVD (physical vapour deposition) ceramic coating. For enhanced scuff resistance and further improved wear, most modern diesel engines have top rings coated with a modified chromium coating known as CKS or GDC, a patent coating from Goetze which has aluminium oxide or diamond particles respectively included in the chrome surface. The lower <b>oil</b> control <b>ring</b> is designed to leave a lubricating oil film, a few micrometres thick on the bore, as the piston descends. Three piece <b>oil</b> <b>rings,</b> i.e. with two rails and one spacer, are used for four-stroke gasoline engines.|$|R

The point of origin is usually a mixing valve (the oil mist generator), connected to this header. Branch lines often feed oil mist to hundreds of rolling elements in the many pumps and drivers connected to a plant-wide system.|$|R
50|$|The GA16DE is a 1.6 litre (1597 cc) engine {{produced}} from November 1990 through 1999. All GA16DEs have sixteen valves and a DOHC head. There are three versions: the North-American first-generation (1991-94) NVCS (VTC), which produces 110 hp (80 kW) at 6000 rpm and 110 lb·ft (146 Nm) at 4000 rpm, the North-American second-generation (1995-1999) NVCS (VTC), which produces 115 hp (85 kW) at 6000 rpm and 110 lb·ft (146 Nm) at 4000 rpm, and a non-NVCS version (European-spec) which makes 102 hp (76 kW). The two variants of the North American NVCS engine are distinguished as such: {{in addition to}} differences in the intake manifolds and (resultantly) the heads, earlier motors used pistons with two compression rings and a single <b>oil</b> <b>ring</b> and put out five less horsepower, while later GA16DEs have a single compression ring and a single <b>oil</b> <b>ring.</b> The GA16DE shares its block and crankshaft with its predecessor, the GA16i; however, their timing chain covers, connecting rods and pistons are altogether different. It is possible to interchange connecting-rod/piston assemblies between the GA16i and GA16DE with no danger to the valve train. Some engines have siamesed exhaust manifolds, while others keep the exhausts separated until the catalytic converter. Earlier ECUs contained the fuel & ignition maps on a discrete ROM IC, making retuning relatively easy, later ECUs buried the maps on a larger more integrated microcontroller's firmware, making retuning {{require the use of}} a daughterboard.|$|E

50|$|A {{ring oiler}} {{is a simple}} device, {{consisting}} of a large metal ring placed around a horizontal shaft, adjacent to a bearing. An oil sump is underneath this shaft and the ring {{is large enough to}} dip into the oil. As the shaft rotates, the ring is carried round with it. The rotating ring in turn picks up some oil and deposits it onto the shaft, from where it flows sideways and lubricates the bearings. The <b>oil</b> <b>ring</b> is effectively a simple lubrication pump, with only one moving part and no complex or high-precision components. The device is crude, but automatic, effective and reliable.

Higher levels of Ca, Zn, P, and S elemental ratios (0. 93 %, 0. 45 %, 1. 55 %, and 1. 60 % as atomic percent) were detected on the cylinder liner surface. Wear width, length, and depth measurements were performed by optical and atomic force microscopies on the ring and cylinder liner surface.

40|$|LectureThe {{choice of}} which {{lubrication}} strategy {{to apply for}} pump bearings has implications for both the short term characteristics exhibited by the bearings and their long term reliability. When lubricating rolling element bearings, four basic strategies have historically been employed: Grease lubrication; Oil bath lubrication; Oil lubrication via slinger disc or oil ring; Oil mist lubrication. For high speed (3000 RPM and higher), slinger discs or oil rings are commonly used due to the short re-greasing interval exhibited with grease lubrication and the high heat generation due to churning seen with oil bath lubrication. This paper seeks to reprise the work of Lemmon & Booser, Heshmat & Pinkus, Gardner and Ettles et al in defining the equations of performance related to oil slinger discs and oil rings. It will then {{address some of the}} operational and reliability concerns of each of these oiling methods using a purpose built test rig that is representative of {{the current state of the}} art in bearing housing design for pumps.
