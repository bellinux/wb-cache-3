In India, for example, tales of vetālas, ghoul-like beings that inhabit corpses, have been compiled in the Baitāl Pacīsī; a prominent story in the Kathāsaritsāgara tells of King Vikramāditya and his nightly quests to capture an elusive one. Piśāca, the returned spirits of evil-doers or those who died insane, also bear vampiric attributes.|$|E
5|$|Among the Betsimisaraka, like {{several other}} Malagasy ethnic groups, {{there is a}} fady against {{speaking}} {{the name of a}} chief after his death or any word that formed part of the name. The deceased leader was given a new name after death that all were required to use and specific synonyms were selected to replace the words composing his name for use in regular conversation; anyone who spoke the forbidden words would be harshly punished <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> instances executed.|$|E

5|$|Men {{spent their}} free time doing crafts such as woodworking, rugmaking, {{leatherwork}} and photography. Outdoor activities included hiking and swimming. Men formed choirs and music ensembles, performing in neighboring towns when relations were good. The men earned two days of furlough for each month of service. These days could be saved to allow enough time to travel several hundred miles home <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> cases traded to other men in exchange for cash.|$|E

Because the Islamic calendar is lunar and the Islamic year is about eleven days shorter than the Gregorian year, the Gregorian date of Hajj changes from year to year. Ihram is the name given to the special spiritual state in which pilgrims wear two white sheets of seamless cloth and abstain from certain actions.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{classified}} as vulnerable as its dwindling and fragmented populations are threatened by habitat destruction. A conservation plan has been drawn up for this species, and research into its current distribution is ongoing. Some of the indigenous peoples of Cameroon either respect this species <b>or,</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> cases, fear it. Today, this rockfowl {{is considered one of}} Africa’s most desirable birds by birders and is a symbol of ecotourism across its range.|$|E
5|$|While {{pressing}} {{forward with}} the troops at Mantinea, Epaminondas {{was hit in the}} chest by a spear (<b>or,</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> accounts, a sword or large knife). Cornelius Nepos suggests the Spartans were deliberately aiming at Epaminondas in the hope of killing him, and thereby demoralizing the Thebans. The enemy who struck the killing blow was variously identified as Anticrates, Machaerion, or Gryllus, son of Xenophon.|$|E

5|$|As a result, {{the distal}} {{arm of the}} third {{axillary}} sclerite rotates upwards and inwards, so that finally its position is completely reversed. The anal veins are articulated with this sclerite {{in such a way}} that when it moves they are carried with it and become flexed over the back of the insect. Activity of the same muscle in flight affects the power output of the wing and so it is also important in flight control. In orthopteroid insects, the elasticity of the cuticle causes the vannal area of the wing to fold along the veins. Consequently, energy is expended in unfolding this region when the wings are moved to the flight position. In general, wing extension probably results from the contraction of muscles attached to the basalar sclerite <b>or,</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> insects, to the subalar sclerite.|$|E
5|$|By the 21st century {{many of the}} Device Forts {{had been}} damaged by, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> cases lost entirely, to coastal erosion; the problem had existed at some {{locations}} since the 16th century and still persists, for example at Hurst. East Cowes Castle and East Tilbury Fort have been entirely lost, while the East Blockhouse, Mersea and Sandsfoot have been badly damaged, a third of Sandgate and most of St Andrews have been washed away. Other sites were demolished, built upon or simply eroded over time; almost no trace remains of the bulwarks along the Downs, for example. The remaining sites are protected by UK conservation law, either as scheduled monuments or listed buildings.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{tests are}} {{sometimes}} used to rapidly distinguish between closely related or morphologically similar species of mushrooms, <b>or,</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> cases, as characters to group species into subsections of a genus. Pigments {{present in the}} fungal hyphae are dissolved or react differently with various chemicals, and the color reactions {{may be used as}} taxonomic characters. When a drop of 10% aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide is applied to the cap of B.mirabilis, the tissue turns a fleeting pink color that fades away. If a drop of commercial bleach (calcium hypochlorite) is applied, the tissue loses its color and becomes a pale blue.|$|E

5|$|Cochrane {{establishes}} {{the book as}} a work of normative political theory asking to what extent animals {{should be included in the}} domain of justice. States can and do regulate human-animal relationships, whether the animals in question are used in agriculture, as companions, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> other way. Cochrane's focus is not on why laws are passed or on comparing laws, but in exploring what kind of laws should be passed. As his focus is on political theory, he is less concerned with questions about individual moral obligations than he is with institutional arrangements. He notes, however, that questions about animals have been neglected in political theory. In the second chapter, Cochrane considers the history of thinking on the relationship between justice and animals. He argues that within ancient philosophy there was disagreement about the inclusion of animals within accounts of justice, in medieval Christian philosophy there was a consensus that they should be excluded, and in modern philosophy there has been a return to disagreement.|$|E
5|$|Courtship {{is often}} aerial and often {{involves}} pheromones. Butterflies then {{land on the}} ground or on a perch to mate. Copulation takes place tail-to-tail and may last from minutes to hours. Simple photoreceptor cells located at the genitals are important for this and other adult behaviours. The male passes a spermatophore to the female; to reduce sperm competition, he may cover her with his scent, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> species such as the Apollos (Parnassius) plugs her genital opening to prevent her from mating again.|$|E
5|$|Deaths usually occur from {{respiratory}} failure or ventricular fibrillation secondary to ongoing seizure activity; fatalities have occurred {{within a few}} hours of ingestion. Poisoned people who recover usually regain consciousness and seizures cease within 24 to 48hours of poisoning, although seizures may persist for up to 96 hours. There are occasional long-term effects such as retrograde amnesia of the events leading to intoxication and the intoxication itself. Other ongoing mild effects may include restlessness, muscle weakness, twitching, and anxiety. Complete resolution of symptoms may take a number of days <b>or,</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> cases, these ongoing symptoms may persist for months after poisoning.|$|E

These four vessels were a Dutch convoy from the Molucca Islands, consisting of: The Dutch national frigate Pallas, of 36 guns, under Captain N. S. Aalbers; Dutch East India Company corvette William, of twenty 24-pounder guns and 110 men, under Captain P. Feteris; Dutch East Indiaman Victoria (<b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> sources Vittoria), of about 800 tons burthen (bm), under Captain Klaas Kenkin and Dutch East Indiaman Batavier, of some 500 tons (bm) under Captain William De Val.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the second}} trial, a further 26 {{defendants}} were still {{due to be}} tried on charges relating to the riot. The Crown Prosecution Service accepted plea bargains where defendants pleaded guilty to violent disorder {{in exchange for the}} dropping of other charges, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> cases all charges were dropped completely. On 20 September 1993 the last remaining defendant to maintain a plea of not guilty went on trial, and he was convicted of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm and sentenced to thirty months imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|Game {{designer}} Shigeru Miyamoto considers Space Invaders to be {{the game}} that revolutionized the video game industry; he was never interested in video games before seeing it. Hideo Kojima also described it as the first video game that impressed him and got him interested in video games. John Romero and John Carmack cited Space Invaders as their introduction to video games. Several publications ascribed {{the expansion of the}} video game industry from a novelty into a global industry {{to the success of the}} game. Edge magazine attributed the shift of video games from bars and arcades to more mainstream locations like restaurants and department stores to Space Invaders. Its popularity was such that it was the first game where an arcade machine's owner could make up for the cost of the machine in under one month, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> places within one week.|$|E
