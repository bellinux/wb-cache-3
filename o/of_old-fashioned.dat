5|$|By {{the time}} of John Moncure Robinson's {{retirement}} {{as president of the}} company in 1893, the Old Bay Line had upgraded its fleet with propeller-driven, steel-hulled steamers equipped with modern conveniences such as electric lighting and staterooms with private baths. The Georgia introduced in 1887 was the first Old Bay Line boat to have a modern screw propeller instead <b>of</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> side paddlewheels and the Alabama launched in 1893 was the company's first steel-hulled vessel. Robinson served the Old Bay Line as president for 26years (1867–1893), longer than any other person in the company's history.|$|E
5|$|Biographer Andrew Morton {{noted that}} most of Madonna's admirers were females, who were born-and-brought-up with an image <b>of</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> {{stereotypes}} of women as virginal brides, or as whores, or with feminist values that rejected {{the use of a}} woman's looks for her self-advancement. Author William McKeen of Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology commented that with the song, Madonna became the last word in attitude and fashion for young girls of that time. He compared that image of Madonna with that of Barbie. McKeen explained that Madonna intermixed middle-class ideas of femininity with examples of what femininity meant to her, which was having equal opportunity. She offered an aggressive sexuality that implied it was acceptable for women not only to initiate relationships, but also enjoy them.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Hiroshima, {{almost all of}} the buildings were <b>of</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> Japanese construction, consisting of timber or timber-framed buildings with timber walls (with or without plaster) and tile roofs. Many of the smaller industries and business establishments were also situated in buildings of timber or other materials not designed to withstand explosions. Nagasaki had been permitted to grow for many years without conforming to any definite city zoning plan; residences were erected adjacent to factory buildings and to each other almost as closely as possible throughout the entire industrial valley. On the day of the bombing, an estimated 263,000 people were in Nagasaki, including 240,000 Japanese residents, 10,000 Korean residents, 2,500 conscripted Korean workers, 9,000 Japanese soldiers, 600 conscripted Chinese workers, and 400 Allied prisoners of war in a camp to the north of Nagasaki.|$|E

5|$|One of Irving's most lasting {{contributions}} to American culture {{is in the}} way Americans perceive and celebrate Christmas. In his 1812 revisions to A History of New York, Irving inserted a dream sequence featuring St. Nicholas soaring over treetops in a flying wagon—a creation others would later dress up as Santa Claus. In his five Christmas stories in The Sketch Book, Irving portrayed an idealized celebration <b>of</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> Christmas customs at a quaint English manor, that depicted harmonious warm-hearted English Christmas festivities he experienced while staying in Aston Hall, Birmingham, England, that had largely been abandoned. He used text from The Vindication of Christmas (London 1652) of old English Christmas traditions, he had transcribed into his journal as a format for his stories. The book contributed to the revival and reinterpretation of the Christmas holiday in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The area {{is thought}} to have had the largest trees of these species on the British Columbia Coast. Only in Elliott Bay, Seattle did the size of trees rival those of Burrard Inlet and English Bay. The largest trees in Vancouver's old-growth forest were in the Gastown area, where the first logging occurred, and on the {{southern}} slopes of False Creek and English Bay, especially around Jericho Beach. The forest in Stanley Park was logged between the 1860s and 1880s, and evidence <b>of</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> logging techniques such as springboard notches can still be seen there.|$|E

As the road approaches Hashamomuck Pond, it replaces Sound View Avenue as the northernmost road on the North Fork. Sound View Avenue leads to Goldsmith's Inlet County Park, Peconic Dunes County Park, Horton Point Light and Hashamomuck Beach. Between Hashamomuck Pond and Greenport West, a section of Middle Road near a motel with the Long Island Sound in the back yard is still paved with concrete, as it was commonly done during the mid-20th century. The section <b>of</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> pavement, however, is short-lived.|$|E

500|$|The 'Powerhouse' era {{ended in}} 1992, when {{all three of}} the triumvirate left at the same time. The new general {{director}} was Dennis Marks, formerly head of music programmes at the BBC, and the new music director was Sian Edwards. Pountney's post of director of productions was not filled. Marks, inheriting a large financial deficit from his predecessors, worked to restore the company's finances, concentrating on restoring ticket sales to sustainable levels. A new production by Miller of Der Rosenkavalier was a critical and financial success, as was a staging of Massenet's Don Quixote, described by the critic Hugh Canning as [...] "the kind <b>of</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> theatre magic which the hair-shirted Powerhouse regime despised".|$|E
500|$|Accusations of {{xenophobia}} {{were also}} made. As George Greenfield observed, [...] "Enid {{was very much}} part of that between-the-wars middle class which believed that foreigners were untrustworthy or funny or sometimes both". The publisher Macmillan conducted an internal assessment of Blyton's The Mystery That Never Was, submitted to them {{at the height of}} her fame in 1960. The review was carried out by the author and books editor Phyllis Hartnoll, in whose view [...] "There is a faint but unattractive touch <b>of</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> xenophobia in the author's attitude to the thieves; they are 'foreign'... and this seems to be regarded as sufficient to explain their criminality." [...] Macmillan rejected the manuscript, but it was published by William Collins in 1961, and then again in 1965 and 1983.|$|E
500|$|Leslie Felprin of The Hollywood Reporter {{praised the}} film as an [...] "affecting if {{somewhat}} soft-soaped comedy drama, elevated by excellent performances."

[...] Scott Foundas of Variety wrote that the film [...] "has all the makings of an irresistible backstage tale, and it's been brought to the screen with a surplus <b>of</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> Disney showmanship...", and that Tom Hanks's portrayal captured Walt Disney's [...] "folksy charisma and canny powers of persuasion— at once father, confessor and the shrewdest of businessmen."

500|$|Vargas Llosa's first {{literary}} influences {{were relatively}} obscure Peruvian {{writers such as}} Martín Adán, Carlos Oquendo de Amat, and César Moro. As a young writer, he looked to these revolutionary novelists in search of new narrative structures and techniques in order to delineate a more contemporary, multifaceted experience of urban Peru. He {{was looking for a}} style different from the traditional descriptions of land and rural life made famous by Peru's foremost novelist at the time, José María Arguedas. Vargas Llosa wrote of Arguedas's work that it was [...] "an example <b>of</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> regionalism that had already exhausted its imaginary possibilities". Although he did not share Arguedas's passion for indigenous reality, Vargas Llosa admired and respected the novelist for his contributions to Peruvian literature. Indeed, he has published a book-length study on his work, La utopía arcaica (1996).|$|E
500|$|Alpha Centauri's {{science fiction}} storyline {{received}} high praise; IGN considered the game {{an exception to}} PC sci-fi cliches, and GamePro compared the plot to the works of writers Stanley Kubrick and Isaac Asimov. J.C. Herz of The New York Times suggested that the game was a marriage of SimCity and Frank Herbert's Dune. GamePros Dan Morris said [...] "As the single-player campaign builds to its final showdown, the ramifications of the final theoretical discoveries elevate Alpha Centauri from great strategy game to science-fiction epic." [...] Game Revolution said, [...] "The well crafted story, admirable science-fiction world, fully realized scenario, and quality core gameplay are sure to please." [...] Edge praised the uniqueness of expression saying it was [...] "the same kind <b>of</b> <b>old-fashioned,</b> consensual storytelling that once drew universes out of ASCII." [...] The in-game writing and faction leaders were also well-received for their believability, especially the voice acting. GameSpot reviewer Denny Atkin called the factions and their abilities Alpha Centauris [...] "most impressive aspect". Greg Tito of The Escapist said, [...] "the genius {{of the game is}} how it flawlessly blends its great writing with strategy elements." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{the passing}} of the 18th and 19th {{amendments}} to the U.S. Constitution, in 1919 and 1920, respectively, the traditional men-only, beer-soaked format of the beefsteak began to change. Politicians began including newly enfranchised women voters in their beefsteak banquets after the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, and with the attendance of women came corresponding social niceties. Cocktails, popularized by illicit drinkers during Prohibition, replaced pitchers of beer, and [...] "fruit cups and fancy salads" [...] were soon added to beefsteak menus. Orchestras were hired in place <b>of</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> brass bands and storytellers, and the long-forbidden knives and forks began to appear on beefsteak tables. By the 1930s, according to Joseph Mitchell, beefsteaks were no longer the manly, messy affairs they had once been; they were now closer to formal meals in which beef and bread happened to feature heavily. The cheerful gluttony of the past was tempered by female sensibilities; [...] "women," [...] Mitchell reported, [...] "do not esteem a glutton, and at a contemporary beefsteak it is unusual for a man to do away with more than six pounds of meat and thirty glasses of beer." ...|$|E

500|$|The song's {{influence}} was most profound on the younger generation. Madonna's public persona of an indomitable, sexually unashamed, supremely confident woman {{struck a chord}} with them. Biographer Andrew Morton noted that most of Madonna's admirers were females, who were born-and-brought-up with an image <b>of</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> stereotypes of women as virginal brides, or as whores, or with feminist values that rejected {{the use of a}} woman's looks for her self-advancement. Author William McKeen of Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology commented that with the song, Madonna intermixed such middle-class ideas of femininity with examples of what femininity meant to her, which was having equal opportunity. In addition, at a time when eighties fashions were promoting flat-chested, stick-thin women as ideals of beauty, the more curvaceous Madonna made average girls feel that it was fine to be in the shape they were. The term [...] "Madonna wannabe" [...] was introduced to describe the thousands of girls who tried to emulate Madonna's style. At one point, Macy's allotted an entire floor area for the sale of clothes styled according to Madonna's fashion. University professors, gender-studies experts and feminists earnestly started discussing her role as a post-modernist style and cultural icon. According to author Debbi Voller, [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] gave rise to the icon Madonna.|$|E
500|$|The visual {{was well}} {{received}} by music critics and {{was nominated for}} a 2014 MTV Video Music Award for Best Cinematography, but lost to Beyoncé's music video [...] "Pretty Hurts". [...] Chad Saville of the Greenspun Media Group called the clip a [...] "mysterious, yet artful celebration of all things California". [...] Opining that the music video was [...] "Lana Being Lana," [...] Billboard journalist Jason Lipshutz commented: [...] "Will she burn her past and head towards the west coast in search of stardom? In many respects, she's already there." [...] Lipshutz's view was echoed by John Boone of E! who deemed [...] "West Coast" [...] Del Rey's [...] "most Lana Del Rey-y video yet" [...] and noted that it contained [...] "the most glamorous smoking you've ever seen". Refinery29's Hayden Manders said the clip contained the three elements of a [...] "perfect Del Rey video"; [...] "cigarettes, a tragic Hollywood starlet and Bradley Soileau". Manders went on to write that [...] "West Coast" [...] contained [...] "enough melancholy to give 'Summertime Sadness' a run for its moody money". Rolling Stone writer Killian Young felt that the clip evoked the style <b>of</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> Hollywood film noir. While HitFix's Melinda Newman felt the visual was a [...] "time-told tale in Hollywood," [...] but [...] "so well-realized, [...] It could play out in Double Indemnity and The Postman Always Rings Twice fashion".|$|E
