As {{part of the}} re-structuring, Muglia became head of the business-productivity group, which oversaw Microsoft Office, Exchange and other business software. According to Computer Reseller News, Muglia pushed developers to visit customers, created customer advisory boards and led <b>other</b> <b>efforts</b> to incorporate customer input into product development at Microsoft.|$|E

5|$|The 1973 {{oil embargo}} and 1979 energy crisis caused a {{reorganization}} of energy policies {{around the world}} and brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies. Deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the Federal Photovoltaic Utilization Program in the U.S. and the Sunshine Program in Japan. <b>Other</b> <b>efforts</b> included the formation of research facilities in the U.S. (SERI, now NREL), Japan (NEDO), and Germany (Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE).|$|E

5|$|Another of Harrison's goals was {{to raise}} {{the morale of the}} {{workforce}} and locomotive engineers; crews were assigned to the same locomotives, and senior engineers were allowed to paint their names on their engines. When business declined in 1914 Harrison reduced his salary by 20percent, but introduced smaller and graduated cuts for other staff, with the smallest percentages at the lowest pay scales. <b>Other</b> <b>efforts</b> to improve morale included rewards for fuel efficiency and the improvement of safety, including stricter investigation of accidents.|$|E
5|$|As the {{deadline}} stipulated in Part XVII of the Constitution for switching to Hindi as primary official language approached, {{the central government}} stepped up its efforts to spread Hindi's official usage. In 1960, compulsory training for Hindi typing and stenography was started. The same year, India's president Rajendra Prasad acted on the Pant Committee's recommendations and issued orders for preparation of Hindi glossaries, translating procedural literature and legal codes to Hindi, imparting Hindi education to government employees and <b>other</b> <b>efforts</b> for propagating Hindi.|$|E

5|$|Turpitude was communicated through visual deceptions in Syria by {{all three}} armed forces. The RAF flew {{reconnaissance}} flights across the supposed targets, whilst the Navy set up major {{facilities in the}} Syrian coastal ports (anti-aircraft guns, search lights and <b>other</b> <b>efforts</b> that might hide major activity). Along the Turkish border the British Ninth Army (the small force protecting Syria), the 31st Indian Armoured Division and 20th Armoured Division (a fictional division, really the dummy tanks of Jones' 24th Armoured Brigade) {{put on a show}} of readiness. Political deception, via Royal Flush, was also used to hint heavily at Allied actions in the region.|$|E
5|$|After Barrington {{suffered}} a paralytic stroke in early 1919, {{he was unable}} to perform. He spent {{the rest of his life}} in poverty, although his fellow actors held benefits and made <b>other</b> <b>efforts</b> to help him, and his brothers and his neighbors in East Hagbourne, Berkshire, helped him as he became increasingly disabled and eventually unable even to speak. He died in 1922 while living at the St. James's Infirmary, Balham, in South London, at the age of 69 and is buried in Lower Morden Lane at the Morden Cemetery, also known as Battersea New Cemetery, in Surrey. On the 75th anniversary of Barrington's death, a granite monument with a photoplaque of Barrington as Pooh-Bah was dedicated to him at the Morden Cemetery, by members of the Gilbert and Sullivan Society, the Sir Arthur Sullivan Society and others.|$|E

After taking 5/85 {{in the first}} innings of the season opener against Karnataka, his performances fell away and he managed only four wickets in his last three matches. Nevertheless, he was selected for Central Zone in the Duleep Trophy and took a total of 2/98 as they lost on first innings to South and were eliminated after one match. Kartik made some contributions with the bat, scoring 197 runs at 24.62 for the season, including a score of 56 against Maharashtra and two <b>other</b> <b>efforts</b> of 30. Playing for both Railways and Central, Kartik took 12 wickets at 23.50 in the one-day matches for the season. He also scored 65 runs at 13.00.|$|E

5|$|One way {{to advance}} {{emergency}} medical care is to obtain the recognition of emergency medicine as a specialty in countries that currently lack it. Without such recognition, {{it is difficult to}} set up training programs or recruit potential students, as they face the uncertainly of training to obtain a credential that may end up being useless to them. Recognition increases the visibility and prestige of the profession and promotes <b>other</b> <b>efforts</b> to advance its development. Botswana may serve as a case study. Its recent recognition of emergency medicine as a specialty has been closely accompanied by the creation of the Botswana Society for Emergency Care, the establishment of a Resuscitation Training Centre and a Trauma Research Centre at the University of Botswana, and the formation of a committee to design a national policy for pre-hospital care.|$|E
5|$|The Council on Foreign Relations' {{assessment}} of global finance notes that excessive institutions with overlapping directives and limited scopes of authority, coupled with difficulty aligning national interests with international reforms, {{are the two}} key weaknesses inhibiting global financial reform. Nations do not presently enjoy a comprehensive structure for macroeconomic policy coordination, and global savings imbalances have abounded {{before and after the}} global financial crisis {{to the extent that the}} United States' status as the steward of the world's reserve currency was called into question. Post-crisis efforts to pursue macroeconomic policies aimed at stabilizing foreign exchange markets have yet to be institutionalized. The lack of international consensus on how best to monitor and govern banking and investment activity threatens the world's ability to prevent future global financial crises. The slow and often delayed implementation of banking regulations that meet Basel III criteria means most of the standards will not take effect until 2019, rendering continued exposure of global finance to unregulated systemic risks. Despite Basel III and <b>other</b> <b>efforts</b> by the G20 to bolster the Financial Stability Board's capacity to facilitate cooperation and stabilizing regulatory changes, regulation exists predominantly at the national and regional levels.|$|E
5|$|The early {{development}} of solar technologies {{starting in the}} 1860s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce. Charles Fritts installed the world's first rooftop photovoltaic solar array, using 1%-efficient selenium cells, on a New York City roof in 1884. However, development of solar technologies stagnated in the early 20thcentury {{in the face of}} the increasing availability, economy, and utility of coal and petroleum. In 1974 it was estimated that only six private homes in all of North America were entirely heated or cooled by functional solar power systems. The 1973 oil embargo and 1979 energy crisis caused a reorganization of energy policies around the world and brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies. Deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the Federal Photovoltaic Utilization Program in the US and the Sunshine Program in Japan. <b>Other</b> <b>efforts</b> included the formation of research facilities in the United States (SERI, now NREL), Japan (NEDO), and Germany (Fraunhofer–ISE). Between 1970 and 1983 installations of photovoltaic systems grew rapidly, but falling oil prices in the early 1980s moderated the growth of photovoltaics from 1984 to 1996.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the 1970s, the CTW's main non-television efforts {{changed from}} {{promotion}} {{to the development}} of educational materials for preschool settings. Early efforts included mobile viewing units that broadcast the show in the inner cities, in Appalachia, in Native American communities, and in migrant worker camps. During the early 1980s, the CTW created the Preschool Education Program (PEP), whose goal was to assist preschools, by combining television viewing, books, hands-on activities, and other media, in using the series as an educational resource. The Workshop also provided materials to non-English speaking children and adults. Starting during 2006, the Workshop expanded its programs by creating a series of PBS specials and DVDs largely concerning how military deployment affects the families of soldiers. <b>Other</b> <b>efforts</b> by the Workshop concerned families of prisoners, health and wellness, and safety.|$|E
