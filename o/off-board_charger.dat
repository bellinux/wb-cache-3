5000|$|SAE is {{developing}} a Combo Coupler variant of the J1772-2009 connector with additional pins to accommodate fast DC charging at 200-450 volts DC and up to 90 kW. This will also use Power Line Carrier technology to communicate between the vehicle, <b>off-board</b> <b>charger,</b> and smart grid. Seven car makers (Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Porsche, Volvo and Volkswagen) had agreed to introduce the [...] "Combined Charging System" [...] in mid-2012. The first vehicles using the SAE Combo plug were the BMW i3 released in late 2013, and the Chevrolet Spark EV released in 2014. In Europe, the combo coupler {{is based on the}} Type 2 (VDE) AC charging connector maintaining full compatibility with the SAE specification for DC charging and the GreenPHY PLC protocol.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} simple and {{generalized}} battery model dedicated to lithium rechargeable batteries of electric vehicles, oriented to the energy management of <b>off-board</b> <b>charging</b> stations. In particular, the mathematical description of the used algorithm, the identification of model parameters and the validation of its use for time emulation of fast charging processes are reported and discussed in detail. The comparison between the emulated charging battery behaviours of a Lithium Iron Phosphate battery and the experimental results is reported in order to confirm {{the accuracy of the}} model.

40|$|In this paper, {{we tested}} the entire {{charging}} process of a single <b>off-board</b> <b>charger</b> in one charging station in Beijing. Among the testing data, we chose the typical power quality parameters and compared them with national standard. Then we drew conclusions as follows: 1) Electric vehicle battery is the capacitive load. It can export reactive power when charging. 2) In the charging process of the <b>off-board</b> <b>charger,</b> indicators of voltage deviation, frequency deviation, pow-er factor, and voltage distortion rate are qualified. 3) <b>Off-board</b> <b>charger</b> produces odd harmonics in the charging process, and with increasing harmonic order, harmonic content reduces. There {{is a certain amount}} of high-order harmonic in <b>off-board</b> <b>charger,</b> mainly distributing around 6650 kHz. 4) Generated harmonics of the actual device, the harmonic is mainly reflected in the current, voltage, only a small distortion...|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, the charger is able {{to provide}} good {{charging}} characteristics to the PEV battery for the different states of charge of the PEV battery as well as delivering a low charging and discharging current ripple of less than 2.5 %. These results validate {{the performance of the}} proposed charger and its control strategy, hence the proposed charger is an excellent option for a PV integrated <b>off-board</b> <b>charger</b> in the charging stations.|$|E
30|$|To provide {{reactive}} power compensation without degrading PEV’s battery during charging, several research works on bidirectional PEV chargers have been reported. A bidirectional <b>off-board</b> <b>charger</b> proposed by [15] employs two linear controllers to track reference active power and {{reactive power}} {{in conjunction with a}} phase-locked loop algorithm. The proposed charger is capable of four quadrant operations but does not have RES integration, thus limiting its potential to be self-sufficient. Meanwhile, in a single-phase on-board bidirectional charger proposed by [25], proportional-integral (PI) controllers are employed in AC/DC converters and DC/DC converters to provide constant voltage and constant current charging as well as {{reactive power compensation}}. However, the proposed charger is only capable for two quadrants of operation. Reference [26] proposes a PEV DC charging station using a neutral point clamped converter. The proposed DC bus architecture allows the connection of distributed power systems such as RES and energy storage devices. The grid-connected converter in the system is regulated using voltage oriented control with multiple linear controllers and for the voltage balancing mechanism, another linear control is utilized. In a separate study, a unified single-phase and three-phase control of on-board PEV chargers proposed by [27] utilizes separate linear controllers with respective references to provide desired control for grid power flow and battery charging.|$|E
50|$|The SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 {{standards}} for electric vehicle charging include IEEE 1901 {{as the standard}} for power line communication between the vehicle, <b>off-board</b> <b>charging</b> station, and the smart grid, without requiring an additional pin; SAE International and the IEEE Standards Association are sharing their draft standards related to the smart grid and vehicle electrification.|$|R
50|$|Advanced {{techniques}} {{are needed to}} overcome noisy direct current environments. Prototypes are operational in vehicles, using CAN-bus, LIN-bus over power line (DC-LIN) and DC-BUS. LonWorks power line based control {{has been used for}} an HVAC system in a production model bus. The SAE J1772 committee is developing standard connectors for plug-in electric vehicles proposes to use power line communication between the vehicle, <b>off-board</b> <b>charging</b> station, and the smart grid, without requiring an additional pin; SAE and the IEEE Standards Association are sharing their draft standards related to the smart grid and vehicle electrification.|$|R
40|$|Switched {{reluctance}} motors (SRMs) {{can provide}} an attractive traction drive for electric vehicle applications. To lower the investment in the <b>off-board</b> <b>charging</b> station facilities, a multi-functional switched reluctance motor topology is proposed {{on the basis of}} the traditional asymmetrical half-bridge converter. The SRM phase windings are employed as input filter inductors and centre-tapped windings are also developed to form symmetrical inductors for three-phase grid supply. Owing to the varying rotor position, phase inductors are unequal between one another. A hysteresis control scheme is therefore developed for grid-connection operation. In addition to AC supplies, the proposed topology can also supports the DC-source charging. A new current sharing strategy is employed to diminish the influence of the unequal winding inductances. The simulation and experimental tests are carried out to verify the proposed topology and control methods. Since this work eliminates the need for building charging station infrastructure, its potential economic impact on the automotive market can be significant...|$|R
40|$|A fully {{integrated}} on-board battery charger for electrical vehicles (EVs) {{has been developed}} recently using a nine-phase machine. All the components used for propulsion are employed in the charging process, no additional components are required, {{and there is no}} need for hardware reconfiguration between charging and propulsion modes of operation. The proposed solution can be connected directly to single-phase or three-phase grid to perform charging, so that the expensive <b>off-board</b> <b>charger</b> infrastructure is not needed. The only requirement is to use a nine-phase machine in combination with a nine-phase inverter in the powertrain of the EV. This however inevitably brings in further advantages in the propulsion mode, such as increased fault tolerance and the current subdivision into more phases. The benefits of the topology, originally developed for an induction machine, make it interesting for further investigation. Therefore, the performance of the charger is examined here using a permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM). The results show that the charger topology is applicable to other types of synchronous machines and is, even more importantly, independent of the angular spatial shift between the individual three-phase windings of the nine-phase machine’s stator. The results are comparable with those obtained using an induction machine and confirm the viability of the solution in conjunction with the PMSM as a propulsion motor...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Advanced Vehicle Testing Activity (AVTA) {{received}} a Neighborhood Electric Vehicle (NEV) from the Korea Automotive Technology Institute (KATECH) for vehicle and battery characterization testing. The KATECH NEV (called the Invita) {{was equipped with}} a lithium polymer battery pack from Kokam Engineering. The Invita was to be baseline performance tested by AVTA’s testing partner, Electric Transportation Applications (ETA), at ETA’s contract testing facilities and test track in Phoenix, Arizona, to AVTA’s NEVAmerica testing specifications and procedures. Before and during initial constant speed range testing, the Invita battery pack experienced cell failures, and the onboard charger failed. A Kokamsupplied <b>off-board</b> <b>charger</b> was used {{in place of the}} onboard charger to successfully perform a constant speed range test on the Invita. The Invita traveled a total of 47. 9 miles in 1 hour 47 minutes, consuming 91. 3 amp-hours and 6. 19 kilowatt-hours. The Kokam Engineering lithium polymer battery was also scheduled for battery pack characterization testing, including the C/ 3 energy capacity, dynamic stress, and peak power tests. Testing was stopped during the initial C/ 3 energy capacity test, however, because the battery pack failed to withstand cycling without cell failures. After the third discharge/charge sequence was completed, it was discovered that Cell 6 had failed, with a voltage reading of 0. 5 volts. Cell 6 was replaced, and the testing sequence was restarted. After the second discharge/charge sequence was complete, it was discovered that Cell 1 had failed, with its voltage reading 0. 2 volts. At this point it was decided to stop all battery pack testing. During the discharge cycles, the battery pack supplied 102. 21, 94. 34, and 96. 05 amp-hours consecutively before Cell 6 failed. After replacing Cell 6, the battery pack supplied 98. 34 and 98. 11 amp-hours before Cell 1 failed. The Idaho National Laboratory managed these testing activities for the AVTA, as part of DOE’s FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies Program...|$|E
30|$|This paper {{presents}} a MPC of an <b>off-board</b> PEV <b>charger</b> with PV integration using two-level four-leg inverter topology. The {{control of the}} charger is realized by incorporating both direct power and current MPC that dynamically controls the decoupled real and reactive power flow as well as PEV battery charging and discharging current. The result shows that the charger using the proposed control strategy achieves four active-reactive quadrants of operations with PV integration with good steady-state and dynamic responses. PV power generation is seamlessly integrated into the charger while maximum PV power is consistently tracked for different environmental conditions. From the grid-side performance analysis, the charger demonstrates less than 1.5 % THD as well as low active and reactive power ripple of less than 7 % and 8 % respectively for all power flow modes.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{multifunctional}} converter to interface {{renewable energy sources}} (e. g., solar photovoltaic panels) and electric vehicles (EVs) with the power grid in smart grids context. This multifunctional converter allows deliver energy from the solar photovoltaic panels to an EV or to the power grid, and exchange energy in bidirectional mode between the EV and the power grid. Using this multifunctional converter are not required multiple conversion stages, as occurs with the traditional solutions, where are necessary two power converters to integrate the solar photovoltaic system in the power grid and also two power converters to integrate an <b>off-board</b> EV battery <b>charger</b> in the power grid (dc-dc and dc-ac power converters in both cases). Taking into account that the energy provided (or delivered) from the power grid in each moment is function of the EV operation mode and also of the energy produced from the solar photovoltaic system, {{it is possible to}} define operation strategies and control algorithms in order to increase the energy efficiency of the global system and to improve the power quality of the electrical system. The proposed multifunctional converter allows the operation in four distinct cases: (a) Transfer of energy from the solar photovoltaic system to the power grid; (b) Transfer of energy from the solar photovoltaic system and from the EV to the power grid; (c) Transfer of energy from the solar photovoltaic system to the EV or to the power grid; (d) Transfer of energy between the EV and the power grid. Along the paper are described the system architecture and the control algorithms, and are also presented some computational simulation results for the four aforementioned cases. It is also presented a comparative analysis between the traditional and the proposed solution in terms of operation efficiency and estimated cost of implementation.
