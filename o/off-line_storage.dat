40|$|JPEG 2000 {{compression}} of very large images (e. g. medical imaging, microscopy, satellite images, photography) requires tiling processing. Tiling processing results in border artifacts. Scan-based wavelet transform avoids these artifacts. However scan-based methods using rate control result in poor local quality control. Most of applications require quality control image coding with- out any real time rate constraint (e. g. <b>off-line</b> compression for <b>storage</b> or for broadcasting over IP, ADSL [...] .). Therefore, we propose a new scan-based wavelet transform compression algorithm based on quality control for JPEG 2000 -like codecs.

40|$|Abstract: We {{explore the}} use of soft {{computing}} and user defined classifications in multimedia database systems for content-based queries. With multimedia databases, due to subjectivity of human perception, an object may belong to different classes with different probabilities (“soft ” membership), as opposed to “hard ” membership supported by conventional database systems. Therefore, we propose a unified model that captures both hard and soft memberships. In practice, however, our model significantly increases the computation complexity (both online and <b>off-line)</b> and the <b>storage</b> complexity of content-based queries. Previously, we introduced a novel fuzzy-logic based aggregation technique to address the online computation complexity. In this paper, we propose novel techniques to cluster sparse user profiles (i. e., items with missing data) to reduce both the off-line computation complexity and the storage complexity. ...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{compression}} of very large images (e. g. medical imaging, microscopy, satellite images) requires stripebased or tiling processing. In some applications, the transmission of compressed data is performed through a rate constrained channel. Thus, rate allocation and control procedures have to be used to fit the channel characteristics. On the contrary, most of applications require high quality image coding without any real time rate constraint (e. g. <b>off-line</b> compression for <b>storage</b> or for broadcasting over IP, ADSL, HDTV [...] .). Therefore, we propose a new stripe-based compression algorithm based on quality control. Our method computes first an optimal subband MSE allocation and then, the corresponding quantization steps. The proposed algorithm provides both the accurate local MSE control and a global rate-distortion improvement when compared to a rate constrained compression scheme. Furthermore, it performs better than JPEG 2000. 1...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} paper investigates a new 3 D handling process in food industry: bin picking. Machines only function effectively when {{the input of}} product is physically well organised, well structured, and consistent. At many stages in a typical production line, foodstuffs are physically arranged as they move through a machine or equipment, however, this order is then lost again as products are ejected onto conveyors, bulked together into bins for transport, taken <b>off-line</b> for chilled <b>storage.</b> Bin picking is generally not solved for manufacturing parts. Unlike food ordering processes such as pick and place operations, vibratory feeders etc., this food handling operation has not been applied to food industry neither. A new approach is presented using the Microsoft KinectTM sensor and Active Shape Models.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} in the mobile {{communications}} technology and wide cellular coverage created an opportunity to satisfy the demand for low-cost health care solutions. Mobile Health (a. k. a. mHealth) is a promising health service delivery concept that utilizes mobile communications technology {{to bridge the gap}} between remotely and sparsely populated communities and health care providers. So far, several mHealth applications have been developed and deployed in the field. Among those, a digital information gathering and dissemination system using mobile devices is the main focus of this work. This type of mHealth system is called Mobile Data Collection System (MDCS). Although MDCS succeeds over traditional paper form based data collection; it has also brought unique challenges such as data security in mobile communications technology. Despite MDCS are often used to collect sensitive health-related data, more work was needed to address security issues like confidentiality, integrity, availability and authentication to secure sensitive health related information in storage, data exchange and processing. When we began this work, Java ME enabled feature phones, that dominated the scene for a decade, were the choice of most MDCS. At that time, in collaboration with our partner project, we proposed a secure custom protocol. The protocol has been implemented, tested, and integrated into our reference MDCS. We have confirmed the flexibility of our secure solution by retrofitting the existing openXdata system with user authentication, secure storage and communication solutions by modifying only a few lines of code in the client-server application. However, in the past few years, the explosion of new mobile platforms and cloudbased services became game changer in our work. The move from feature phones to smartphones brought to the table the need to reevaluate, redesign, and port our earlier secure solution to smartphones based MDCS by considering the unique features and challenges of both smart phone clients and cloud-based server-side deployments. In this dissertation, we analyze the challenges in securing mobile data collection systems deployed in remote areas, in resources-constrained environment, and in low project budget settings. We present a flexible and secure framework that offers user authentication both online and <b>off-line,</b> secure mobile <b>storage,</b> secure communication, and secure cloud storage. Besides, the framework provides data integrity, user account and data recovery, and multi-user management and is designed to be easily integrated in existing MDCS with minimal effort. Although fundamental security issues are conceptually identical in both old feature phone and current smartphone based solutions, our framework and the proposed solutions address the unique aspects of both mobile platforms. We also discuss the solution we designed for older Java ME based devices, and how they are still relevant. For this work, we collaborated with the open-source MDCS, openXdata and Open Data Kit (ODK). </p...|$|R
