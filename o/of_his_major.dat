5|$|A {{commission}} {{to create a}} portal for Paris' planned Museum of Decorative Arts was awarded to Rodin in 1880. Although the museum was never built, Rodin worked throughout his life on The Gates of Hell, a monumental sculptural group depicting scenes from Dante's Inferno in high relief. Often lacking a clear conception <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>major</b> works, Rodin compensated with hard work and a striving for perfection.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker had won {{a popular}} victory, {{redeemed}} his promise to Edna, and endeared himself for life to Jack Atherton and his fellow railway workers. The case was celebrated {{in the press and}} became one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>major</b> political assets.|$|E

5|$|Elgar {{has been}} {{described}} as the first composer to take the gramophone seriously. Between 1914 and 1925, he conducted a series of acoustic recordings of his works. The introduction of the moving-coil microphone in 1923 made far more accurate sound reproduction possible, and Elgar made new recordings of most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>major</b> orchestral works and excerpts from The Dream of Gerontius.|$|E
5|$|He {{was picked}} up by the Montreal Expos in the {{following}} season for only $400,000 and had the worst season of his career. His last game of the season was two innings of relief during extra innings of an all-Canada interleague game (sometimes called the Pearson Cup) won by Toronto on July 2. It {{turned out to be the}} last game <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>major</b> league career. On July 15, 1997, Lee Smith announced his retirement.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{initiative}} {{came from}} Norman Pierre Gentieu (1914–2009), an American writer who discovered Sorabji by reading his book Around Music {{just after the}} Second World War. Because of the post-war shortages in England, Gentieu sent Sorabji some provisions, {{and the depth of}} their friendship appears to have been such that he continued to do so for the next four decades. In the early 1950s Gentieu made an offer to Sorabji to pay for the microfilming <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>major</b> piano works and to give some copies to selected libraries. All of his unpublished musical manuscripts were eventually microfilmed. Gentieu also sent Sorabji a tape recorder to record some of his music, but Sorabji did not do so.|$|E

5|$|After the end <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>major</b> league career, Martin {{returned}} to the minor leagues, serving as a player-manager with the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League in 1945 and 1946 before becoming the player-manager for the Greenville Spinners of the South Atlantic League in 1947. His fiery, competitive nature was still evident in July 1945 when {{it was reported that}} he had punched one of his players for not performing to his standards. While managing the Miami Sun Sox of the Florida International League in 1949, he was fined and suspended {{for the remainder of the}} season for choking an umpire. In August 1951, he made news again when he was arrested after a Sun Sox game when he went into the stands to punch a spectator in Lakeland, Florida.|$|E
5|$|As a legislator, Beshear {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as a consumer advocate, and sponsored bills to increase environmental protections and end the practice of commercial bail bonding. In 1974, Beshear voted against a resolution condemning the practice of desegregation busing because it called for changes to the federal constitution. One <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>major</b> accomplishments in the House was spearheading legislation to improve neonatal care at the University of Kentucky Medical Center. Although he considered a 1978 bill requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in Kentucky classrooms to be unconstitutional, he abstained from voting on it rather than voting against it, a move he later claimed he regretted.|$|E
5|$|Flick {{began his}} career in semi-professional {{baseball}} and played in minor league baseball for two years. He was noticed by George Stallings, {{the manager of the}} Phillies, who signed Flick as a reserve outfielder. Flick was pressed into a starting role in 1898 when an injury forced another player to retire. He excelled as a starter. Flick jumped to the Athletics in 1902, but an court injunction prevented him from playing in Pennsylvania. He joined the Naps, where he continued to play for the remainder <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>major</b> league career, which was curtailed by a stomach ailment.|$|E

5|$|In 1734, he {{switched}} sides {{and joined the}} supported Augustus III. After several years of distrust, August III started treating Poniatowski as one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>major</b> advisers. Over the next few years, throughout the 1740s, he and familiar supported plans for reform and strengthening the Commonwealth, however {{most of them have}} failed due to liberum veto disrupting the Sejm proceedings. Those failures likely resulted in the his apathy, and he became much less active on the political scene in the 1750s. On 6 June 1752 he received the office of castellan of Kraków.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, he {{returned}} to his native Florida as Vice President and General Manager, then later as President, of the Orlando Predators of the Arena Football League. One <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>major</b> projects with the Predators was taking the team a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ stock exchange. In 1998, Youngblood's final year with the team, the club won its first Arena League championship, defeating the favored Tampa Bay Storm. In 1999, he began to work for the AFL office as a liaison to the National Football League and served as a special consultant to the Arena Football League and arenafootball2.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn enjoyed {{early success}} in Germany, {{where he also}} revived {{interest}} in the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, and in his travels throughout Europe. He was particularly well received in Britain as a composer, conductor and soloist, and his ten visits there– during which many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>major</b> works were premiered– form {{an important part of}} his adult career. His essentially conservative musical tastes set him apart from many of his more adventurous musical contemporaries such as Franz Liszt, Richard Wagner, Charles-Valentin Alkan and Hector Berlioz. The Leipzig Conservatoire (now the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig), which he founded, became a bastion of this anti-radical outlook.|$|E

5|$|Of the 60 players picked in {{the first}} round by Detroit, 30 have been pitchers, the most of any position; 25 of these were right-handed, while 5 were left-handed. Eleven outfielders were selected, while five shortstops, five catchers, three first basemen, three third basemen and one second baseman were taken as well. One {{additional}} player, Lance Parrish (1974), was drafted as an infielder but ultimately spent the majority <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>Major</b> League career at catcher. Twelve of the players came from high schools or universities in the state of California, followed by Texas with nine players. The Tigers have also drafted five players from their home state of Michigan.|$|E
5|$|Saint-Saëns wrote {{more than}} forty chamber works between the 1840s and his last years. One of the first <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>major</b> works in the genre was the Piano Quintet (1855). It is a straightforward, {{confident}} piece, in a conventional structure with lively outer movements and a central movement containing two slow themes, one chorale-like and the other cantabile. The Septet (1880), for the unusual combination of trumpet, two violins, viola, cello, double bass and piano, is a neoclassical work that draws on 17th-century French dance forms. At {{the time of its}} composition Saint-Saëns was preparing new editions of the works of baroque composers including Rameau and Lully.|$|E
5|$|Smith was a {{candidate}} for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame for 15 years, but failed to ever reach the 75% support threshold needed for election, peaking at 50%. After the end <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>major</b> league career, Smith spent time working as a pitching instructor at the minor-league level with the San Francisco Giants. He then served as the pitching coach for the South Africa national baseball team in the 2006 World Baseball Classic and 2009 World Baseball Classic. Lee currently continues {{his job as a}} minor-league roving pitching instructor for the Giants.|$|E

5|$|The {{settlements}} at Tilsit gave Napoleon time {{to organize}} his empire. One <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>major</b> objectives became enforcing the Continental System against the British. He {{decided to focus}} his attention on the Kingdom of Portugal, which consistently violated his trade prohibitions. After defeat in the War of the Oranges in 1801, Portugal adopted a double-sided policy. At first, John VI agreed to close his ports to British trade. The situation changed dramatically after the Franco-Spanish defeat at Trafalgar; John grew bolder and officially resumed diplomatic and trade relations with Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{strain of}} dual careers and {{constant}} separation {{from his wife}} led to an extended breach in his marriage. The couple began separation proceedings in 1916, and separation by mutual consent was granted in 1919. In the period 1916–22, Nielsen often lived on Funen retreating to the Damgaard and Fuglsang estates, or worked as a conductor in Gothenburg. The period was one of creative crisis for Nielsen which, coinciding with World War I, would strongly influence his Fourth (1914–16) and Fifth symphonies (1921–22), arguably his greatest works according to Fanning. The composer was particularly upset in the 1920s when his long-standing Danish publisher Wilhelm Hansen was unable to undertake publication of many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>major</b> works, including Aladdin and Pan and Syrinx.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{made his}} major league {{debut in the}} second game of a doubleheader on September 21, 1948. He pitched a {{complete}} game against the Cincinnati Reds, allowing one run on five hits, striking out five, and walking five batters to collect the first win <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>major</b> league career. He appeared in one other game during the 1948 season, pitching four innings {{in the second game}} of a doubleheader against the New York Giants on September 28, allowing three runs in a 6–3 Philadelphia victory. Thompson wore the uniform number 9 during his brief call-up.|$|E
