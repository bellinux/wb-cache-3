50|$|On September 9, 2014, {{the film}} was {{released}} on Blu-ray and DVD by Synapse Films, featuring a restored print from the <b>original</b> <b>film</b> <b>negatives,</b> as well as featuring a documentary as well as outtakes, original promotional material, and deleted scenes from the network television cut as bonus material.|$|R
25|$|In 2012 {{the first}} series was {{released}} on high definition Blu-ray discs by Network Distributing Ltd.. For this release the <b>original</b> <b>film</b> <b>negatives</b> were scanned in HD and comprehensively restored by BBC Studios and Post Production. The pilot episode (Regan) was also given a Blu-ray release by Network {{at roughly the same}} time.|$|R
25|$|The {{movie was}} {{released}} as a 2-disc Blu Ray set in Region 2 on 19 September 2016. The footage was not re-scanned from the <b>original</b> <b>film</b> <b>negatives.</b> Instead it is a 1080/50i upscale which suffered from same PAL speedup issue as previous home media releases. As of March 2017, no North American release is scheduled.|$|R
50|$|Featuring 20 {{tracks in}} total, the DVD {{featured}} footage that was traced back {{as close to}} its original source as possible. In many cases this meant {{going back to the}} <b>original</b> <b>film</b> <b>negative,</b> which was then digitally re-transferred and remastered. With footage shot on video, it was necessary to go back to John Lennon’s original camera tapes (all on long-obsolete formats) and have them re-transferred.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, United Artists and Apple Records {{digitally}} remixed {{the audio}} {{of the film}} for a highly successful theatrical and home video re-release. Though the visuals were not digitally restored, a new transfer was done after cleaning the <b>original</b> <b>film</b> <b>negative</b> and rejuvenating the colour. A soundtrack album for this version was also released, which featured the first extensive digital stereo remixes of Beatles material.|$|E
50|$|To {{create a}} {{photographic}} mask, {{a sheet of}} negative film is contact-exposed to the <b>original</b> <b>film</b> <b>negative</b> or slide positive in a particular way. Both films are then combined to produce a processed positive. The process is similar when applied using digital techniques: the inverse of the working image is reduced to an image mask; filters or other adjustments are then applied, using the mask to selectively block portions of the image.|$|E
40|$|In 2008, {{scientists}} at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) Lunar Sample Laboratory and Image Science & Analysis Laboratory (under {{the auspices of the}} Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science Directorate or ARES) began work on a 4 -year project to digitize the <b>original</b> <b>film</b> <b>negatives</b> of Apollo Lunar Rock Sample photographs. These rock samples together with lunar regolith and core samples were collected as part of the lander missions for Apollos 11, 12, 14, 15, 16 and 17. The <b>original</b> <b>film</b> <b>negatives</b> are stored at JSC under cryogenic conditions. This effort is data restoration in the truest sense. The images represent the only record available to scientists which allows them to view the rock samples when making a sample request. As the negatives are being scanned, they are also being formatted and documented for permanent archive in the NASA Planetary Data System (PDS) archive. The ARES group is working collaboratively with the Imaging Node of the PDS on the archiving...|$|R
50|$|In 2013 a group show titled The Many Faces of David Bowie {{took place}} at Opera Gallery in London, UK.

The show was titled X-Change, heavily featuring the <b>film</b> <b>negative</b> and x-ray works for the first time.|$|R
50|$|Emergency! seasons 1 - 6 are now {{available}} on Netflix on Demand in high definition (though several episodes are missing due to rights issues), having been restored and rescanned from the <b>original</b> <b>film</b> <b>negatives.</b> The series ran on MeTV from September 2013 to December 2016, an over-the-air service mainly seen on digital subchannels of local television stations. Starting in January 2017, the series moves to the NBC Universal owned digital broadcast network Cozi TV.|$|R
50|$|Both the <b>{{original}}</b> <b>film</b> <b>negative</b> and Romero's original cut of {{the film}} are lost. Parts of Romero's original version have been found and re-edited into home video version of the film which currently runs 104 minutes.Anchor Bay released the film under its Season of the Witch title in 2005 on DVD at its partly-restored 104 minute running time. The DVD contains featurettes on the film, other works of Romero and promotional material and Romero's earlier film There's Always Vanilla.|$|E
50|$|Note: When {{transferring}} a Techniscope film to {{a digital}} video format, the 2-perf negative or 2-perf interpositive A/B rolls {{can be used}} (the <b>original</b> <b>film</b> <b>negative</b> from the camera, or the first-generation film elements prepared for {{the making of the}} anamorphic 4-frame 35 mm release print negative), thus bypassing any blown-up 4-perf element. Many DVD editions have been transferred this way and the results have frequently been stunning, e.g. Blue Underground's The Bird with the Crystal Plumage and MGM's special editions of Sergio Leone's Westerns.|$|E
50|$|Film editing used an offline {{approach}} {{almost from}} the beginning. Film editors worked with a workprint of the <b>original</b> <b>film</b> <b>negative</b> to protect the negative from handling damage. When two-inch quadraplex video tape recording was first introduced by Ampex in 1956, {{it could not be}} physically cut and spliced as simply and cleanly as film negatives could be. One error-prone method option was to cut the tape with a razor blade. Since there was no visible frame line on the 2 in tape, a special ferrofluid developing solution was applied to the tape, allowing the editor to view the recorded control track pulse under a microscope, and thus determine where one frame ended and the next began. This process was not always exact, and if imperfectly performed would lead to picture breakup when the cut was played. Generally this process was used to assemble scenes together, not for creative editing.|$|E

5000|$|Before Lionsgate's current video {{release of}} Mad Monster Party, almost all video {{releases}} {{have been from}} 16 mm film and were of very poor color quality.

50|$|The company {{continued}} making popular films {{into the}} 1920s, despite Hepworth's now unchanging and increasingly old-fashioned film style.

All of the <b>original</b> <b>film</b> <b>negatives</b> in Hepworth's possession were melted down by the receiver in order to sell the silver, and his feature films have been considered lost for many decades. However, an original 35mm. print of his 1920 film Helen of Four Gates was located in a film archive in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 2008.|$|R
