50|$|A {{constant}} {{problem of}} airfields located outside {{the territory of}} the country whose forces are based there is that of <b>overflight</b> <b>rights.</b> The UK has a treaty with Cyprus that guarantees British access to Akrotiri in any circumstances.

50|$|In {{the case}} of the United States Navy during and after the Cold War, virtual command of the sea in many of the world's {{waterways}} allowed it to deploy aircraft carriers and project air power almost anywhere on the globe. By operating from international waters, U.S. carriers can bypass the need for conventional airbases or <b>overflight</b> <b>rights,</b> both of which can be politically difficult to acquire.|$|R
25|$|Austria {{began to}} {{reassess}} its definition of neutrality following {{the fall of}} the Soviet Union, granting <b>overflight</b> <b>rights</b> for the UN-sanctioned action against Iraq in 1991, and since 1995, it has developed participation in the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy. Also in 1995, it joined NATO's Partnership for Peace and subsequently participated in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia. Meanwhile, {{the only part of the}} Constitutional Law on Neutrality of 1955 still fully valid is not to allow foreign military bases in Austria.|$|R
40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{the relationship between}} the U. S. and Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan is becoming an important power in Central Asia by virtue of its large territory, ample natural resources, and strategic location. However, it faces political, ethnic, economic, and environmental challenges to its stability and integrity. After the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, Kazakhstan granted <b>overflight</b> <b>rights</b> for U. S. -led coalition actions in Afghanistan, and in 2003 provided some troops for post-conflict rebuilding in Iraq...|$|R
50|$|In recent years, however, Austria {{has begun}} to {{reassess}} its definition of neutrality, granting <b>overflight</b> <b>rights</b> for the UN-sanctioned action against Iraq in 1991, and, since 1995, contemplating participation in the EU's evolving security structure. Also in 1995, it joined the Partnership for Peace, and subsequently participated in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia. Discussion of possible Austrian NATO membership intensified during 1996. ÖVP and the Team Stronach aim at moving closer to NATO or a European defense arrangement. SPÖ and FPÖ, in turn, believe continued neutrality {{is the cornerstone of}} Austria's foreign policy, and a majority of the population generally supports this stance.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 2001 September 11 attacks, Romania backed the US on its [...] "war on terrorism", giving <b>overflight</b> <b>rights</b> to the USAF during the US invasion of Afghanistan. The country's military also actively participated both in the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force and the US-led Operation Enduring Freedom. In 2004, Romania was finally accepted as a full member of NATO. The Năstase government also took steps towards European integration. The government successfully finalised negotiations with the European Union on most subjects, and 2007 was set as a tentative date for admission into the Union.|$|R
50|$|Regular {{services}} on the Cairo to Basra route began on 12 January 1927 using DH.66 aircraft, replacing the previous RAF mail flight. Following 2 years of {{negotiations with the}} Persian authorities regarding <b>overflight</b> <b>rights,</b> a London to Karachi service started on 30 March 1929, taking 7 days and consisting of a flight from London to Basle, a train to Genoa and a Short S.8 Calcutta flying boats to Alexandria, a train to Cairo and finally a DH.66 flight to Karachi. The route was extended as far as Delhi on 29 December 1929. The route across Europe and the Mediterranean changed {{many times over the}} next few years but almost always involved a rail journey.|$|R
50|$|When the US {{decided to}} orbit a {{scientific}} satellite during the International Geophysical Year (IGY), a 1955 proposal from NRL, {{to build a}} launch vehicle based on the Viking as a first stage with a second stage based on the smaller Aerobee sounding rocket was selected, and again Rosen was project manager. The maturity of the Viking and Aerobee rockets {{played an important role}} in the choice. However there was also a strong hidden motive higher in the US government: to establish a precedent for <b>overflight</b> <b>rights</b> to Eastern Bloc territory with a non-military civilian research rocket, in preparation for the highly secret national reconnaissance satellite program then underway. This classified NRL proposal was the genesis of Project Vanguard.|$|R

50|$|For the Libyan raid, the United States {{was denied}} <b>overflight</b> <b>rights</b> by France, Spain, and Italy {{as well as}} the use of European {{continental}} bases, forcing the Air Force portion of the operation to be flown around France and Spain, over Portugal and through the Straits of Gibraltar, adding 1,300 miles (2,100 km) each way and requiring multiple aerial refuelings. The French refusal alone added 2,800 km and was imposed despite the fact that France had itself been the target of terrorism directed by the Gaddafi government in Libya. French president Mitterrand refused overflight clearance because the United States was interested in limited action in Libya while France was more interested in major action that would remove Gaddafi from power.|$|R
40|$|Abstract (max. 2000 char.) : Autonomous Aerial Sensors, i. e. {{meteorological}} sensors {{mounted on}} Unmanned Aerial Systems UAS, can characterise the atmospheric flow {{in and around}} wind farms. We instrumented three planes, a helicopter and a lighter-than-air LTA system to fly one week together in a well-instrumented wind farm, partly with nanosynchronised sensors (time stamped with about 100 ns global accuracy). Between bankruptcy of a partner, denied <b>overflight</b> <b>rights</b> at the main test location, denied Civil Aviation Authorities permits at the alternative location, stolen planes, and crashed UAS we managed to collect data at a wind farm in Lolland and on an atmospheric campaign in France.

For two years {{he was responsible for}} developing direct aid programmes in Central Asia and the Caucasus, worth €50 million. He was involved in negotiations with Russia on airline <b>overflight</b> <b>rights,</b> and launched a conference in Tashkent in 1993 that founded TRACECA—an international transport programme {{for the development of a}} transport corridor for Europe, the Caucasus and Asia. Vice-President and Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan then offered Clegg a job in his private office, as a European Union policy adviser and speech writer.

Another drawback hit the carrier following the [...] United Nations Security Council Resolution 748, adopted {{as a consequence}} of the Libyan government allegedly having supported the terrorists responsible for the bombings of Pan Am Flight 103 and UTA Flight 772. The resolution saw a trade embargo imposed on Libya, which included the delivery of new aircraft or spare parts that could possibly boost the military capacity of the country, and Libyan Airlines was denied any landing or <b>overflight</b> <b>rights</b> of third-party countries. Thus, all international flights came to an end, and LAA could only operate on domestic routes.|$|R
25|$|When {{faced with}} refusals of basing and <b>overflight</b> <b>rights</b> from {{continental}} European countries during Operation El Dorado Canyon, the U.S. {{was forced to}} use the UK-based F-111s in the 1986 air-strikes against Libya. The KC-10s and KC-135s allowed 29 F-111s, along with other Air Force and Navy aircraft, to reach their targets. The KC-10 again {{played a key role}} during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm in 1991; KC-10s facilitated the deployment of tactical, strategic, and transport aircraft to Saudi Arabia. In the early stages of Operation Desert Shield, aerial refueling was key to the rapid airlift of materiel and forces. In addition to refueling airlift aircraft, the KC-10, along with the smaller KC-135, moved thousands of tons of cargo and thousands of troops in support of the massive buildup. The KC-10 and the KC-135 conducted about 51,700 separate refueling operations and delivered 125 million gallons (475 million liters) of fuel without missing a single scheduled rendezvous.|$|R
5000|$|U.S. policy since 1983 {{provides}} that the United States will exercise and assert its navigation and <b>overflight</b> <b>rights</b> and freedoms on a worldwide basis {{in a manner}} that is consistent with the balance of interests reflected in the Law of the Sea (LOS) Convention. The United States will not, however, acquiesce in unilateral acts of other states designed to restrict the rights and freedoms of the international community in navigation and overflight and other related high seas uses. The FON Program since 1979 has highlighted the navigation provisions of the LOS Convention to further the recognition of the vital national need to protect maritime rights throughout the world. The FON Program operates on a triple track, involving not only diplomatic representations and operational assertions by U.S. military units, but also bilateral and multilateral consultations with other governments in an effort to promote maritime stability and consistency with international law, stressing the need for and obligation of all States to adhere to the customary international law rules and practices reflected in the LOS Convention.|$|R
500|$|Khrushchev was {{undecided}} {{what to do}} at the summit even as he boarded his flight to Paris. He finally decided, in consultation with his advisers on the plane and Presidium members in Moscow, to demand an apology from Eisenhower and a promise {{that there would be no}} further U-2 flights in Soviet airspace. Neither Eisenhower nor Khrushchev communicated with the other in the days before the summit, and at the summit, Khrushchev made his demands and stated that there was no purpose in the summit, which should be postponed for six to eight months, that is until after the 1960 United States presidential election. The U.S. President offered no apology, but stated that the flights had been suspended and would not resume, and renewed his Open Skies proposal for mutual <b>overflight</b> <b>rights.</b> This was not enough for Khrushchev, who left the summit. Eisenhower accused Khrushchev [...] "of sabotaging this meeting, on which so much of the hopes of the world have rested". Eisenhower's visit to the Soviet Union, for which the premier had even built a golf course so the U.S. President could enjoy his favorite sport, was canceled by Khrushchev.|$|R
25|$|He {{also made}} {{a great impact on}} the {{extension}} of British Civil Aviation through his support for Imperial Airways and by his part in creating the Empire Air Mail Scheme, in which he went as a passenger in one of the early proving flights to India in December 1926. He negotiated <b>overflight</b> and landing <b>rights</b> with South Africa and other African administrations, Australia and India.|$|R
5000|$|In addition, to Modern Air's {{abortive}} {{attempts to}} launch a regular, year round long-haul charter programme from West Berlin in partnership with Berliner Flugring, the airline and its long-standing business partner also attempted {{for a number of}} years to gain all necessary approvals for West Berlin's first-ever charter flight to Moscow as part of a one-off, all-inclusive city break package in the Soviet capital. Modern Air's management hoped to be able to build on its earlier success of 1968, when interventions at the highest level of the US government with its Soviet counterpart had resulted in Modern Air becoming the first US non-scheduled airline to be given permission at short notice to fly a US charter party to Moscow for a brief stopover on its first transpolar flight ("Polar Byrd I"). In addition to being a test of the limits of East-West cooperation in the then prevailing political climate of Détente (which aimed to create a more stable and predictable political environment by easing Cold War tensions), it was thought that this would be a major publicity coup for the airline and help it to raise its public profile further. Despite appearing cooperative initially, the Soviet authorities imposed increasingly onerous conditions on the airline and tour operator for the programme to go ahead. These ultimately proved unworkable and forced its abandonment. Similar to the case of the Bulgarian communist authorities' sudden and unexplained withdrawal of landing and <b>overflight</b> <b>rights</b> for flights originating/terminating in West Berlin (despite the much-needed hard currency Bulgaria earned from air navigation fees and airport user charges paid by the American and British airlines that operated these flights), some Western political observers at the time suspected behind-the-scenes East German lobbying of its Warsaw Pact ally and chief political backer respectively to have caused this to ensure East Germany's political and economic interests were not ignored in its Cold war allies' interactions with the West, especially where these concerned relations with West Berlin.|$|R
25|$|In {{the mid-1950s}} boycott {{activities}} intensified, and gained {{a new and}} highly powerful ally — the Soviet Union. During Israel's early years it was seen by the USSR as a potential ally due to the significant socialist aspirations advocated by its founders and applied in its conception. The Soviet Union {{was one of the}} first countries to recognize Israel de jure upon its establishment in 1948. However, as Israel's democratic nature became evident and its ties with Western states were solidified, the Soviet Union would view Israel as an enemy in the West vs. East dichotomy of the Cold War. Instead, the Soviet Union would form an alliance with the revolutionary Arab regimes, Egypt, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, and later in the decade Iraq, united in anti-American and anti-Israel political objectives. The clout of the Soviet Union gave the boycott new international legitimacy and guaranteed anti-boycott resolutions a veto at the UN Security Council. The tertiary boycott, formerly ignored as an affront to international trade relations, became enforceable through the sheer political and economic power of the Soviet Union. In 1958, Air France capitulated to Arab League demands after being denied <b>overflight</b> and landing <b>rights</b> in Arab states for eighteen months due to its alleged investment in Israeli development projects.|$|R
