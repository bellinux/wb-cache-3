5|$|Mice {{have been}} used as an {{experimental}} system to investigate possible mechanisms by which levels of sex steroid hormones might regulate nervous system function. During the part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouse</b> estrous cycle when progesterone is highest, the level of nerve-cell GABA receptor subtype delta was high. Since these GABA receptors are inhibitory, nerve cells with more delta receptors are less likely to fire than cells with lower numbers of delta receptors. During the part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouse</b> estrous cycle when estrogen levels are higher than progesterone levels, the number of delta receptors decrease, increasing nerve cell activity, in turn increasing anxiety and seizure susceptibility.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with other}} members of the lipocalin protein family, major urinary {{proteins}} can be potent allergens to humans. The reason for this is not known, however molecular mimicry between Mups and structurally similar human lipocalins has been proposed as a possible explanation. The protein product <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouse</b> Mup17 gene, known as Musm1, Ag1 or MA1, accounts for much of the allergenic properties of mouse urine. The protein is extremely stable in the environment; studies have found 95% of inner city homes, and 82% of all types of homes in the United States have detectable levels in at least one room. Similarly, Ratn1 is a known human allergen. A US study found its presence in 33% of inner city homes, and 21% of occupants were sensitized to the allergen. Exposure and sensitization to rodent Mup proteins is considered a risk factor for childhood asthma, and is a leading cause of laboratory animal allergy (LAA)—an occupational disease of laboratory animal technicians and scientists. One study found that two-thirds of laboratory workers who had developed asthmatic reactions to animals had antibodies to Ratn1.|$|E

5|$|The mouse {{reference}} genome has {{at least}} 21 distinct Mup genes (with open reading frames), and a further 21 Mup pseudogenes (with reading frames disrupted by a nonsense mutation or an incomplete gene duplication). They are all clustered together, arrayed side by side across 1.92 megabases of DNA on chromosome 4. The 21 functional genes have been divided into two sub-classes based on position and sequence similarity: 6 peripheral Class A Mups, and 15 central Class B Mups. The central Class B Mup gene cluster formed {{through a number of}} sequential duplications from one of the Class A Mups. As all the Class B genes are almost identical to each other, researchers have concluded that these duplications occurred very recently in mouse evolution. Indeed, the repetitive structure of these central Mup genes means {{they are likely to be}} unstable and may vary in number among wild mice. The Class A Mups are more different from each other and are therefore likely to be more stable, older genes but what, if any, functional differences the classes have are unknown. The similarity between the genes makes the region difficult to study using current DNA sequencing technology. Consequently, the Mup gene cluster is one of the few parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouse</b> whole genome sequence with gaps remaining, and further genes may remain undiscovered.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Personnel {{experiencing}} accidents {{that involve}} radionuclides or victims of potential malicious radioactive attacks may suffer injuries with wounds contaminated by radionuclides. The current treatment for contamination from uranium in external injuries is <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> saline solution {{to wash the}} wounds, which has <b>the</b> drawback <b>of</b> further spreading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contaminants due to <b>the</b> flow <b>of</b> water. To minimize <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> storage of contaminated liquids and to improve <b>the</b> efficiency <b>of</b> treatment, we propose <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> hydrogels {{as a form of}} decorporation agent. Methods: Mice with uranium-contaminated wounds on their backs were treated with bisphosphonate or diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) containing supramolecular hydrogels. Survival rates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treated <b>mice</b> and changes in <b>the</b> body weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mice</b> were observed and compared to those of mice without hydrogel treatment. Distribution <b>of</b> uranium in <b>the</b> <b>mice</b> was also explored as proof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hydrogel treatment. Results: <b>The</b> survival rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hydrogel-treated <b>mice</b> was significantly higher than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mice</b> without treatment. <b>The</b> body weights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hydrogel-treated <b>mice</b> showed significant recovery after 10 days while <b>the</b> body weight <b>of</b> <b>mice</b> without hydrogel treatment continuously decreased. <b>The</b> amount <b>of</b> uranyl ions in the organs (mainly concentrated in <b>the</b> kidney) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hydrogel-treated <b>mice</b> was much smaller than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mice</b> without hydrogel treatment.
