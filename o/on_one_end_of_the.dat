5|$|Christians at {{the time}} of Constantine's {{conversion}} made up only 10% of the population. This would rise to 50% {{by the end of the}} fourth century and 90% by the end of the fifth century. Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565) then brutally mopped up the rest of the pagans, highly literate academics <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scale and illiterate peasants on the other. A conversion so rapid seems to have been rather the result of expediency than of conviction.|$|E

25|$|There were {{optional}} {{systems to}} dial {{the phone or}} pick it up, but these were generally implemented as separate devices also intended to be used <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> connection or the other. For instance, the autodialler was a system that automated the action of {{picking up the phone}} and dialing a number, and was normally implemented as a separate box that connected to another port on the host computer. Such devices were typically expensive and generally used by larger organizations like banks, who might use one to send an end-of-day file to branch offices.|$|E
25|$|Another {{test was}} electronic; {{they were asked}} to {{influence}} the burnout point of a common fuse. After they were given a chance to work it with their mind, an increasing amount of current was run through the fuse until it blew. The two proved to have amazing abilities in this test after a few trials, eventually causing the fuses to blow immediately once they got used to it. In fact, they were simply palming the already blown fuses and then handing them back to the experimenters. They also found that pressing down <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuse in its holder, or just touching it briefly, caused the instruments to record unusual results that were interpreted by the experimenters as psi effects.|$|E
50|$|Many {{versions}} of the phénakisticope used smaller illustrated uncut cardboard discs {{that had to be}} placed on a larger slotted disc. A common variant had the illustrated disc <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a brass axis and the slotted disc on the other end; this was slightly more unwieldy but needed no mirror and was claimed to produce clearer images.|$|R

25|$|The {{experiment}} is normally conducted using electrically neutral particles or atoms. This avoids the large deflection {{in the path}} of a charged particle moving through a magnetic field and allows spin-dependent effects to dominate. For example, observation of the Stern–Gerlach effect with free electrons is infeasible. If the particle is treated as a classical spinning magnetic dipole, it will precess in a magnetic field because of the torque that the magnetic field exerts on the dipole (see torque-induced precession). If it moves through a homogeneous magnetic field, the forces exerted on opposite ends of the dipole cancel each other out and the trajectory of the particle is unaffected. However, if the magnetic field is inhomogeneous then the force <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dipole will be slightly greater than the opposing force on the other end, so that there is a net force which deflects the particle's trajectory. If the particles were classical spinning objects, one would expect the distribution of their spin angular momentum vectors to be random and continuous. Each particle would be deflected by a different amount, producing some density distribution on the detector screen. Instead, the particles passing through the Stern–Gerlach apparatus are deflected either up or down by a specific amount. This was a measurement of the quantum observable now known as spin angular momentum, which demonstrated possible outcomes of a measurement where the observable has a discrete set of values or point spectrum. Although some discrete quantum phenomena, such as atomic spectra, were observed much earlier, the Stern–Gerlach experiment allowed scientists to observe separation between discrete quantum states {{for the first time in}} the history of science.|$|E
500|$|After the {{redesign}} of the Enterprise sets was complete, Michelson {{turned his attention}} to creating the original sets needed for the film.

Elsewhere, Fuller carried a mock-suitcase bomb to film in Grosvenor Square. However, because the American Embassy is situated next to the square, shortly after Fuller and the filming crew arrived, they found themselves surrounded by five armed American security officers who believed Fuller was about to commit an attack. Fortunately, location manager Patrick Stuart was able to [...] "sweet-talk" [...] the American officials, and they were allowed to film in the area.|$|E

500|$|The {{antiparallel}} tetrameric {{organization of}} the Kinesin-5 family is fundamentally different from the majority of other kinesins that are dimers, such as the well-characterized conventional Kinesin-1 (KIF5B). [...] Conventional kinesin dimerizes {{in such a manner}} that the catalytic (head) domains are together <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complex to facilitate hand-over-hand movement along a microtubule that enables long-range, directed transport of cellular cargoes. [...] The unique assembly of Kinesin-5 proteins not only organizes the protein complex for a different cellular function (antiparallel microtubule sliding, described above) but also made it difficult to study the mechanical properties of the motor using the classical experiments that were designed for dimeric kinesins. [...] These obstacles have been overcome by either adapting the original experiments to analyze the tetrameric organization of Kinesin-5, or by working with shorter Kinesin-5 proteins that form dimers like conventional kinesin.|$|E
500|$|Brothers Glenn and Todd Kessler {{decided to}} work with Daniel Zelman because [...] "we have a third brother, but Daniel {{is kind of like}} our fourth brother that we've known for over 20 years." [...] When the Kesslers and Zelman devised the series, they did not {{specifically}} intend for Patty and Ellen to be lawyers. They wanted to explore the power structures in two strong women—feeling that the male power dynamics had been seen before—and considered a number of professions, including entertainment and pharmaceuticals, before deciding on law. Zelman said that the writers' main motivation to write about the law [...] "was our interest in power dynamics, the dynamics of power in society. We're very much interested in the ambiguity of it. We're just interested in seeing how far we can push these characters." [...] According to Kessler, [...] "One thing that's crucial is that Patty Hewes is <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spectrum and Ellen Parsons is on the other." [...] The relationship the writers were most interested in showing was that between a mentor and a mentee, which is represented by Patty and her protégée Ellen. Todd Kessler called the real life Enron case [...] "a big part" [...] of the inspiration for Patty's main case involving Arthur Frobisher, though Zelman claims that Enron was not used as a basis in particular: [...] "It was more just the culture of all those corporate scandals at the time. There seemed to be one after the other of them, and we became very interested in sort of the characters who were a part of those scandals." ...|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{the amount}} of space covered by the staging area and the band members often being spread out, a {{traditional}} public address system front-loaded <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arena was deemed inadequate. O'Herlihy worked with Clair Global to rethink how to create an arena sound system. As a result, U2's sound system was moved to the venue ceilings and arranged in an oval array of 12 speaker clusters. The band hoped the change would improve acoustics by evenly distributing sound throughout the arena. O'Herlihy said, [...] "It allows us to project the music without it being enormously loud."
