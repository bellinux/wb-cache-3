5|$|The French were infuriated at King Leopold III's <b>open</b> <b>declaration</b> of {{neutrality}} in October 1936. The French Army saw {{its strategic}} assumptions undermined; it {{could no longer}} expect closer cooperation with the Belgians in defending the latter's eastern borders, enabling a German attack to be checked well forward of the French border. The French were dependent on how much cooperation they could extract from the Belgians. Such a situation deprived the French any prepared defences in Belgium to forestall an attack, a situation which the French had wanted to avoid as it meant engaging the German Panzer Divisions in a mobile battle. The French considered invading Belgium immediately {{in response to a}} German attack on the country. The Belgians, recognising the danger posed by the Germans, secretly made their own defence policies, troop movement information, communications, fixed defence dispositions, intelligence and air reconnaissance arrangements available to the French military attaché in Brussels.|$|E

25|$|Man on a Balcony, {{with its}} monumental {{architecture}} of semi-abstract elements, is an <b>open</b> <b>declaration</b> {{of the principles}} of Cubist painting. The composition exemplifies the Cubist style of reverberating lines and fractured planes as applied to the traditional format of the full-length portraiture. The treatment of the subject is sufficiently representational to permit the identification of the tall, elegant figure as Dr. Théo Morinaud, a dental surgeon in Paris.|$|E

25|$|Haughey's grip on {{political}} power began to slip {{in the autumn}} of 1991. There was a series of resignations by chairmen of semi-state companies, followed by an <b>open</b> <b>declaration</b> by Minister for Finance Albert Reynolds that he had every intention of standing for the party leadership if Haughey retired. Following a heated parliamentary party meeting Seán Power, one of Reynolds's supporters, put down a motion of no-confidence in Haughey. Reynolds and his supporters were sacked from the government by Haughey, who {{went on to win the}} no-confidence motion by 55 votes to 22.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the growth}} of the theosophical {{movement}} in the 19th century, and influenced by theosophy's articulations on the Maitreya, non-Buddhist religious and spiritual movements have adopted and reinterpreted the concept in their doctrines. Share International, which equates Maitreya with the prophesied figures of multiple religious traditions, claims that he is already present in the world, but is preparing to make an <b>open</b> <b>declaration</b> of his presence in the near future. They claim that he is here to inspire mankind to create a new era based on sharing and justice.|$|E
25|$|The United States took further {{measures}} to increase pressure on Argentina. All Argentine companies {{suspected of having}} ties with the Axis powers were blacklisted, and the supply of newsprint was limited to pro-allied newspapers. There were also boycotts. American exports of electronic appliances, chemical substances and oil production infrastructure were halted. The properties of forty-four Argentine companies were seized, and scheduled loans were halted. Hull wanted to weaken the Argentine government, or force its resignation. Torn between diplomatic and economic pressure {{as opposed to an}} <b>open</b> <b>declaration</b> of war against Argentina, he opted for the former way, to avoid disrupting the supply of food to Britain. Nevertheless, he also saw the situation as a chance for the United States to have a greater influence over Argentina than Britain.|$|E
25|$|On 29 May 1988, Zia {{dissolved}} the National Assembly {{and removed}} the Prime Minister under article 58(2)b of the amended Constitution.

5000|$|The {{historic}} {{advantage of}} genres {{is to allow}} the direct marketing of fiction. While the reader of so-called elitist literature will follow public discussions of novels, the popular production has to employ the traditionally more direct and short-term marketing strategies with the <b>open</b> <b>declarations</b> of their content. The most popular novels are based entirely on the expectations for the particular genre, and this includes {{the creation of a}} series of novels with an identifiable brand name. i.e. the Sherlock Holmes series by Arthur Conan Doyle ...|$|R

2500|$|H. G. Wells {{had been}} a friend of Reeves' parents {{and one of the}} most popular {{speakers}} to address the CUFS. After Reeves' address to the Philosophical Society it was rumoured that she and Wells, one of the most prominent and prolific writers of the first half of the twentieth century, had gone to Paris for a weekend. Their appearance together at a supper party thrown for fellow Fabian and Governor of Jamaica Sir Sydney Olivier, 1st Baron Olivier was the first <b>open</b> <b>declaration</b> of the romantic relationship between the pair. Wells claimed that Reeves responded to his taste for adventurous eroticism, and the [...] "sexual imaginativess" [...] that his wife Jane could not cope with. Wells maintained that their relationship be kept silent, though Reeves saw no reason their exciting affair be kept a secret. Once their relationship became well known there were numerous attempts to break it up, particularly from Amber's mother and from George Rivers Blanco White, a lawyer who would later marry her.|$|E

He later argued that Aksai Chin was already under Chinese jurisdiction and that the McCartney-MacDonald Line was the line China could accept. Zhou later argued that as the boundary was undemarcated and had never been defined by treaty between any Chinese or Indian government, the Indian government could not unilaterally define Aksai Chin's borders.|$|R

I caused the ship's cook and his mate to come on shore and dress our dinner, and the old cook's mate we had on shore assisted. We brought on shore six pieces of good beef, and four pieces of pork, out of the ship's provision, with our punch-bowl, and materials to fill it; and, in particular, I gave them ten bottles of French claret, and ten bottles of English beer, things that neither the Spaniards nor the Englishmen had tasted for many years; and which it may be supposed they were exceeding glad of.|$|R
2500|$|After {{the failure}} of the {{expedition}} to the Parana, Ouseley wrote to his government requesting 10,000 British soldiers, 10,000 French soldiers and an <b>open</b> <b>declaration</b> of war to conclude the conflict. In 1846 the 73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot sailed from Cork, and after docking at Rio de Janeiro, arrived in Montevideo, which it defended for seven months against besieging Argentine troops. However, unknown to Ouseley, Tomás Samuel Hood was already navigating to Buenos Aires with the opposite instructions from the allied countries: negotiate an end to the hostilities, at whatever price Rosas demanded. [...] The repercussion of the battle of Vuelta de Obligado modified the international perception of the conflict in La Plata. Hood had also promoted an end to the conflicts because Rosas had suspended the payment of the Argentine foreign debt to Britain as long as Britain maintained the blockade, and a long conflict would harm the finances of the Baring Brothers bank. Besides, there was an ongoing political scandal in Britain, as The Times had published Ouseley was favoring a personal business with the blockade.|$|E
2500|$|Support {{for the no}} rate {{strategy}} among leading councillors in Hackney {{was among}} the strongest anywhere. The <b>open</b> <b>declaration</b> by the council of its intentions led one Hackney resident, Mourad Fleming, {{to go to law}} before the council held its budgeting meeting seeking judicial review of the council's actions. In February 1985 Fleming had been the SDP candidate in a byelection in Hackney's Clissold ward which had been won by a Labour candidate pledged to the no rate strategy. On 6 March 1985 in the High Court, Mr Justice Mann issued an interlocutory declaration that the council had a duty to set a rate which did not breach the cap and that it could not use interim borrowing powers. Notwithstanding the judgment and firm advice from the borough solicitor that the council had to set a rate, on 7 March the council passed a resolution declaring that [...] "the council considers {{it would be impossible to}} make a rate". The resolution disguised the refusal to set a rate as a delay pending negotiation with the Secretary of State.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 May 2002, Adair was {{released}} from prison again. Outside the prison he was greeted by up to 300 of his supporters. Once free, he was a key {{part of an effort to}} forge stronger ties between the UDA and the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF), a small breakaway faction of the UVF founded in 1996 by Billy Wright and following his killing, commanded by Mark [...] "Swinger" [...] Fulton, with whom Adair was on good terms. Fulton had been in Maghaberry since December 2001. The most <b>open</b> <b>declaration</b> of this alliance was a joint mural depicting Adair's UDA [...] "C company" [...] and the LVF. Other elements in the UDA strongly resisted these movements, which they saw as an attempt by Adair to win external support in a bid to take over the leadership of the UDA. Some UDA members disliked his overt association with the drugs trade, which the LVF were even more heavily involved with. For his part Adair controlled a block of flats in his Lower Shankill stronghold from which he and his allies dealt drugs.|$|E

2500|$|During late 2014 {{and early}} 2015, the band moved {{recording}} and production over to Montreal, Quebec, at the Golden Ratio Studios, where they worked with Canadian music producer Damian Taylor, {{who had previously}} worked with American rock band The Killers on their 2011 album Battle Born, and as a creative companion to Icelandic musician Björk. An initial version of the album with 13 tracks was tracked {{at the end of}} April 2015, however, the creative process continued when additional songs were written and recorded for the album. Numerous delays pushed the recording and production of the album well into 2015, despite an <b>open</b> <b>declaration</b> early in that year, by Mandagi, that the album would be soon completed. By then, the band had collaborated with European producer Pascal Gabriel, co-writer and producer of various Marina and the Diamonds and Goldfrapp tracks, British songwriter and producer Justin Parker, known for his work with American recording artist Lana Del Rey, and American producer Ben H. Allen, who had previously produced albums for art rock acts Animal Collective and Deerhunter. Ultimately, in October 2015, 32 months after the band started production, amassing over 40 song ideas in the process, the album's production entered the audio mixing phase. Mandagi expressed dissatisfaction with the album's lengthy recording process, though insisted that he and the band were, in contrast, satisfied with the outcome and the final product, stating, [...] "sometimes it was ok, sometimes it was a bit trying but you know nothing good comes easy we just had to keep at it. We didn't put it out until it was right, 'til we felt right." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The Old Guard was {{convinced}} that the 1934 Declaration of Principles was an <b>open</b> <b>declaration</b> in favor of armed insurrection; Thomas believed it was a necessary statement to indicate that Socialists would not lie down in the face of fascism. The Old Guard believed that the anti-war sections of the Declaration of Principles placed the party under the threat of legal prosecution for advocating unlawful actions to oppose war; again Thomas believed that a strong statement was necessary to put capitalism on warning that if it engaged in imperialist war there would be opposition. The Old Guard believed that a united front with the Communists was immoral and would be disastrous for the Socialists, that even limited united action on specific causes should be banned, and even that exploratory discussions about a united front were going too far. Thomas opposed a united front on a general level, including any joint actions in political contests, but he thought that carefully planned united action on specific cases could, and should, take place. And he believed that it was worth while to conduct exploratory talks, even though he felt they would likely lead to nothing. The Old Guard felt that the Socialists' invitation to unaffiliated radicals and the Party's acceptance of former Communists, Lovestoneites, and Trotskyists was turning the party away from democratic socialism and to Communism. Thomas, though he disagreed with the ideology of these anti-Stalinist Communists, was willing to try to work with a party that included them, if they were willing to accept party discipline and not try to take over the Party. The Old Guard considered the Revolutionary Policy Committee, a far-left group within the Socialist Party, a Communist and anarchist group that had no place in a democratic socialist party. Thomas disagreed with the 'romantic revolutionists' in the Revolutionary Policy Committee (as he disagreed with the 'romantic parliamentarians' of the Old Guard), but still felt it was useful to try to salvage some of the enthusiasm and dedication that went into the Revolutionary Policy Committee by permitting its members to remain in the Party if, again, they followed party policy and party discipline." ...|$|E
