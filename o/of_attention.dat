40|$|This study {{investigates the}} deficits in the {{quantity}} and quality <b>of</b> joint <b>attention</b> in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To obtain a holistic measure <b>of</b> joint <b>attention,</b> the following four aspects were considered: a) the quantity <b>of</b> Initiation Joint <b>Attention</b> (IJA) and Response Joint Attention (RJA), b) non-verbal behaviours which were atypically used during joint attention, c) the quality <b>of</b> joint <b>attention</b> and d) the association between quality and quantity <b>of</b> joint <b>attention</b> in children with ASD. These aspects were measured in three children with ASD and three typically-developing children (TDC). Measures were derived from 30 -minute video recordings of a play session between each child and his/her caregiver and compared. This study established that there was a statistically significant difference in the quantity <b>of</b> joint <b>attention</b> in both IJA and RJA. The difference in the quality <b>of</b> joint <b>attention</b> was not statistically significant. However, when analysing children with ASD individually, a deficit in the quality <b>of</b> joint <b>attention</b> was identified in two of the three subjects. Compared to TDC, children with ASD engaged significantly less in IJA through manipulation of objects and eye-gaze and significantly more in IJA and RJA through challenging behaviour. In addition, there was no association between the deficits in quality and quantity <b>of</b> joint <b>attention</b> within individuals with ASD, as the three subjects portrayed diverse profiles. Children with ASD exhibited atypical joint attention skills when compared to the control group. Moreover, the frequency of initiations <b>of</b> joint <b>attention</b> bids was the most negatively affected aspect in children with ASD. Quality <b>of</b> joint <b>attention</b> is rarely researched and to the researchers’ knowledge, no other study has measured both quality and quantity <b>of</b> joint <b>attention</b> in children with ASDpeer-reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Selective {{attention}} {{refers to}} the ability to enhance the processing of relevant stimuli, while suppressing the processing of irrelevant distractors. The neural mechanisms <b>of</b> selective <b>attention</b> are vulnerable in children from lower socioeconomic status families, yet these neural mechanisms can also be enhanced with evidence-based, targeted training. The series of studies presented in this dissertation investigated the individual differences in development and neuroplasticity <b>of</b> selective auditory <b>attention</b> in association with nonverbal cognitive abilities, in relation to genetic influences, and in the context of gene x intervention interactions. To this end, a multi-method approach was adopted, combining several methodologies such as event-related potentials (ERPs), behavioral measures, molecular genetics, and a randomized, controlled intervention design. 	In the first study, individual differences in neural mechanisms <b>of</b> selective auditory <b>attention</b> were studied, in association with nonverbal cognitive abilities. More robust ERP selective attention effects were associated with superior nonverbal IQ performance. These results indicated a noteworthy relationship between neural mechanisms <b>of</b> selective <b>attention</b> and nonverbal IQ performance in lower socioeconomic status (SES) preschoolers. In the second study, the relationship between 5 -HTTLPR polymorphism and neural mechanisms <b>of</b> selective auditory <b>attention</b> was assessed. ERPs <b>of</b> selective <b>attention</b> effect were larger in children who carried at least one short allele of 5 -HTTLPR, in comparison to long-homozygotes. These results associated being homozygous for the long allele with weaker neural mechanisms <b>of</b> selective <b>attention</b> in lower SES children. In the third study, these genetic influences were investigated {{in the context of an}} effective family-based training program previously shown to improve neural mechanisms <b>of</b> selective <b>attention</b> in lower SES preschoolers. The long-homozygote children, who initially displayed more attenuated ERPs <b>of</b> selective auditory <b>attention</b> than their short-carrier peers, showed robust ERPs <b>of</b> selective <b>attention</b> at posttest, but only if they were randomly assigned to the training program. These findings demonstrated that an effective family-based training could moderate the genetic influences of 5 -HTTLPR on the neural mechanisms <b>of</b> selective <b>attention.</b> Taken together, the studies presented in this dissertation contribute to elucidating individual differences in development and neuroplasticity <b>of</b> selective auditory <b>attention</b> in lower SES preschoolers.

40|$|The human being, {{the most}} {{magnificent}} autonomous entity in the universe, frequently takes {{the decision of}} `what to look at' in their day-to-day life without even realizing {{the complexities of the}} underlying process. When it comes to the design <b>of</b> such an <b>attention</b> system for autonomous robots, all of a sudden this apparently simple task appears to be an extremely complex one with highly dynamic interaction among motor skills, knowledge and experience developed throughout the life-time, highly connected circuitry of the visual cortex, and super-fast timing. The most fascinating thing about visual <b>attention</b> system <b>of</b> the primates is that the underlying mechanism is not precisely known yet. Different influential theories and hypothesis regarding this mechanism, however, are being proposed in psychology and neuroscience. These theories and hypothesis have encouraged the research on synthetic modeling <b>of</b> visual <b>attention</b> in computer vision, computational neuroscience and, very recently, in AI robotics. The major motivation behind the computational modeling <b>of</b> visual <b>attention</b> is two-fold: understanding the mechanism underlying the cognition of the primates' and using the principle <b>of</b> focused <b>attention</b> in different real-world applications, e. g. in computer vision, surveillance, and robotics. Accordingly, we observe the rise of two different trends in the computational modeling <b>of</b> visual <b>attention.</b> The first one is mostly focused on developing mathematical models which mimic, as much as possible, the details <b>of</b> the primates' <b>attention</b> system: the structure, the connectivity among visual neurons and different regions of the visual cortex, the flow of information etc. Such models provide a way to test the theories of the primates' visual attention with minimal involvement from the live subjects. This is a magnificent way to use technological advancement for the understanding of human cognition. The second trend in computational modeling, on the other hand, uses the methodological sophistication of the biological processes (like visual attention) to advance the technology. These models are mostly concerned with developing a technical system <b>of</b> visual <b>attention</b> which can be used in real-world applications where the principle <b>of</b> focused <b>attention</b> might play a significant role for redundant information management. This thesis is focused on developing a computational model <b>of</b> visual <b>attention</b> for robotic cognition and, therefore, belongs to the second trend. The design <b>of</b> a visual <b>attention</b> model for robotic systems as a component of their cognition comes with a number of challenges which, generally, do not appear in the traditional computer vision applications <b>of</b> visual <b>attention.</b> The robotic models <b>of</b> visual <b>attention,</b> although heavily inspired by the rich literature <b>of</b> visual <b>attention</b> in computer vision, adopt different measures to cope with these challenges. This thesis proposes a Bayesian model <b>of</b> visual <b>attention</b> designed specifically for robotic systems and, therefore, tackles the challenges involved with robotic visual <b>attention.</b> The operation <b>of</b> the proposed model is guided by the theory of biased competition, a popular theory from cognitive neuroscience describing the mechanism <b>of</b> primates' visual <b>attention.</b> The proposed Bayesian attention model offers a robot-centric approach <b>of</b> visual <b>attention</b> where the head-pose of a robot in the 3 D world is estimated recursively such that the robot can focus on the most behaviorally relevant stimuli in its environment. The behavioral relevance of an object determined based on two criteria which are inspired by the postulates of the biased competitive hypothesis <b>of</b> visual <b>attention</b> in the primates. Accordingly, the proposed model encourages a robot to focus on novel stimuli or stimuli that have similarity with a `sought for' object depending on the context. In order to address a number of robot-specific issues <b>of</b> visual <b>attention,</b> the proposed model is further extended to the multi-modal case where speech commands from the human are used to modulate the visual <b>attention</b> behavior <b>of</b> the robot. The Bayes model <b>of</b> visual <b>attention,</b> inherited from the Bayesian sensor fusion characteristic, naturally accommodates multi-modal information during attention selection. This enables the proposed model to be the core component <b>of</b> an <b>attention</b> oriented speech-based human-robot interaction framework. Extensive experiments are performed in the real-world to investigate different aspects of the proposed Bayesian visual attention model...|$|R
