5|$|Training was {{undertaken}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>voluntary</b> and unpaid basis with weekly parades being undertaken at Kelvin Grove, while field training {{took place at}} Fraser's Paddock in Enoggera and Redbank. By July 1939, the battalion's strength was 550 officers and other ranks.|$|E
5|$|Flight 825 was piloted by 36-year-old Captain John Hood, {{a native}} of Bulawayo who had gained his {{commercial}} pilot licence in 1966. He had flown Viscounts for Air Rhodesia since 1968, and had also served in the Rhodesian Air Force <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>voluntary</b> basis. His first officer, Garth Beaumont, was 31 years old, and had lived in Rhodesia {{for most of his}} life, having immigrated as a child from South Africa. The two air stewardesses were Dulcie Esterhuizen, 21 years old and from Bulawayo, and 23-year-old Louise Pearson, from Salisbury.|$|E

5|$|In 1948, with {{demobilisation}} of Australia's wartime army complete, {{the decision}} was made to re-raise the part-time forces of the Militia, albeit with the new name of the Citizens Military Force (CMF), and on a reduced establishment of two infantry divisions, an armoured brigade and various corps-level support units. During this time the 3rd Division was re-raised and based around a nucleus of three infantry brigades—the 4th, 6th and 9th Brigades—it was once again based in central Victoria, although subunits were also based in South Australia and Tasmania. Once again the division's component units bore little resemblance to those that had fought with it during the two World Wars. Service in the post war CMF was initially <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>voluntary</b> basis and recruitment remained poor until 1951 when conscription was introduced once again in an effort to improve the readiness of the Australian military during the Korean War. The 3rd Division was not deployed during this time, however, and although national service was instituted, service in Korea was undertaken <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>voluntary</b> basis, and conscription was used only as a means to expand the CMF and provide a base upon which mobilisation could be achieved if it proved necessary.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{organization}} in Central California and the group in Northern California continue to develop and present summer camps for youth by youth, led by a corps of volunteer adults. The program will observe its 60th anniversary in 2018. Participation in the Monterey-based group has continued to increase each year, to 420 participants in 2015, including 33 youth from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and mainland China, up from 70 in 2006. The group sponsored by the White Stag Association has attracted between 40 and 83 campers from 2010 to 2014. The two programs have operated continuously since the program's founding entirely <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>voluntary</b> basis, with an estimated 21,000 youth having attended its camps.|$|E
5|$|Filipino and English are the {{official}} languages of the country. Filipino is a standardized version of Tagalog, spoken mainly in Metro Manila and other urban regions. Both Filipino and English {{are used in}} government, education, print, broadcast media, and business. In most towns, the local indigenous language is spoken. The Philippine constitution provides {{for the promotion of}} Spanish and Arabic <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>voluntary</b> and optional basis, although neither are used on as wide a scale as in the past. Spanish, which was widely used as a lingua franca in the late nineteenth century, has since declined greatly in use, but is experiencing revival due to government promotions, while Arabic is mainly used in Islamic schools in Mindanao. However, Spanish loanwords are still present today in many of the indigenous Philippine languages.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, {{a lawsuit}} {{challenging}} this segregation {{led to a}} 1983 settlement agreement in which St. Louis County school districts agreed to accept black students from the city <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>voluntary</b> basis. State funds were used to transport students to provide an integrated education. The agreement also called for white students from the county to voluntarily attend city magnet schools, {{in an effort to}} desegregate the City's remaining schools. Despite opposition from state and local political leaders, the plan significantly desegregated St. Louis schools; in 1980, 82 percent of black students in the city attended all-black schools, while in 1995, only 41 percent did so. During the late 1990s, the St. Louis voluntary transfer program was the largest such program in the United States, with more than 14,000 enrolled students.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days, team {{management}} was undertaken by a club committee. When payment of players was legalised in 1885, Alfred Jones began {{to act as}} club secretary <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>voluntary</b> basis. Small Heath's election to the newly formed Second Division of the Football League in 1892 prompted {{the board of directors}} to appoint him as the club's first paid official, responsible as secretary-manager for matters on the field in addition to his administrative duties. In his first season the club won the inaugural Second Division championship, and gained promotion to the First Division {{for the first time the}} following year via the Test Match system. Jones's 16-year tenure saw three promotions and three relegations, after the last of which in 1908 he resigned. Successor Alex Watson's two seasons in charge ended with the club having to apply for re-election to the league and with responsibility for team affairs passing to former player Bob McRoberts, who became the club's first dedicated team manager.|$|E
5|$|Recruiting for {{the relief}} force began {{immediately}} in England <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>voluntary</b> basis and would ultimately include men from every regiment of the British Army, {{as well as}} all the dominions. The North Russian Relief Force (NRRF) subsequently formed two brigades—one under the command of Brigadier General Lionel Sadlier-Jackson, and the other under Brigadier General George Grogan, and both under the overall command of Major General Edmund Ironside. Sadlier-Jackson's brigade included over 4,000 men, including the 45th and 46th Battalions, the Royal Fusiliers, supporting machine gunners from the 201st Machine Gun Battalion, as well as artillery, signallers and engineers. Grogan’s brigade was primarily drawn from battalions of the Worcestershire Regiment.|$|E

50|$|A deed {{of company}} {{arrangement}} {{is also a}} type of administration. But unlike a scheme of arrangement {{it is not a}} standalone process.

5|$|The legions, {{which had}} been a mix of life {{professionals}} and civilian campaigners, was altered into a standing army of professionals only. The actual structure of the cohort army remained {{much the same as}} in the late Republic, although around the 1st centuryAD the first cohort of each legion was increased in size to a total of 800 soldiers. However, while the structure of the legions remained much the same, their make-up gradually changed. Whereas early Republican legions had been raised by a draft from eligible Roman citizens, imperial legions were recruited solely <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>voluntary</b> basis and from a much wider base of manpower. Likewise, whereas Republican legions had been recruited almost exclusively in Italy, early Imperial legions drew most of their recruits from Roman colonies in the provinces from 68AD onwards. One estimate places the proportion of Italian troops at 65% under Augustus in c.1AD, falling to around 49% by the end of Nero's reign.|$|E
5|$|After the Square Enix merger, {{however, the}} {{individual}} teams still continued to program and customize their own tools for each game, which would eventually {{go to waste}} as only their respective creators {{knew how to use}} them. With the amount of assets and tools required by the in-development Final Fantasy XII and the impending advent of the seventh console generation, a common data format for the company was proposed in 2004. It was to be developed in-house and replace general-purpose formats such as FBX and COLLADA. Realizing the goal of an engine with a common set of tools proved to be difficult, as many production teams wanted to further their own interests rather than those of the company as a whole. Select staff members from different company divisions teamed up to work on the project <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>voluntary</b> basis, but their loose organizational structure failed to yield results. Nevertheless, Murata considered this group effort a first step in the right direction. In 2005, he was appointed general manager of the newly formed Technology Division. Although this enabled Murata and his subordinates to talk about a company-wide engine more extensively, the lack of manpower again prevented any significant achievements.|$|E
5|$|The Commonwealth of Australia {{was founded}} on 1 January 1901. On 1 March, 29,010 colonial soldiers, {{consisting}} of 1,544 professional soldiers, 16,105 paid militia and 11,361 unpaid volunteers, were transferred to the new Australian Army. However, the units continued to be administered under the various colonial Acts. Major General Sir Edward Hutton, a former commander of the New South Wales Military Forces, was appointed as the first commander of the Commonwealth Forces, assuming command in early 1902 with Army Headquarters subsequently formed at Victoria Barracks in Melbourne. The Defence Act 1903 brought all of the state units under one piece of legislation; although more significantly, it prevented the raising of standing infantry units, only allowing the establishment of permanent administrative and instructional staff for headquarters, garrison artillery, fortress engineers, submarine mining engineers, and service, medical and ordnance units. It also stipulated that the force could only be maintained by voluntary enlistment {{and that it could}} not serve outside Australia. In this it effectively established the pre-eminence of the Citizen Forces, ensuring that the Australian Army would primarily consist of part-time militia and volunteer forces, which would be supported by a small permanent force limited to filling staff, training and garrison roles. It equally ensured that any force sent overseas could only be done so <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>voluntary</b> basis.|$|E

5|$|The rise of Veerashaivaism was revolutionary and {{challenged}} the prevailing Hindu caste system which retained royal support. The social {{role of women}} largely depended on their economic status and level of education in this relatively liberal period. Freedom was more available to women in the royal and affluent urban families. Records describe the participation {{of women in the}} fine arts, such as Chalukya queen Chandala Devi's and Kalachuris of Kalyani queen Sovala Devi's skill in dance and music. The compositions of thirty Vachana women poets included the work of the 12th-century Virashaiva mystic Akka Mahadevi whose devotion to the bhakti movement is well known. Contemporary records indicate some royal women were involved in administrative and martial affairs such as princess Akkadevi, (sister of King Jayasimha II) who fought and defeated rebellious feudals. Inscriptions emphasise public acceptance of widowhood indicating that Sati (a custom in which a dead man's widow used to immolate herself on her husband's funeral pyre) though present was <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>voluntary</b> basis. Ritual deaths to achieve salvation were seen among the Jains who preferred to fast to death (Sallekhana), while people of some other communities chose to jump on spikes (Shoolabrahma) or walking into fire on an eclipse.|$|E
