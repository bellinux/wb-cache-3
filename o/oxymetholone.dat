25|$|Methyltestosterone and ethyltestosterone (17α-ethyltestosterone) are {{the parent}} {{structures}} of all 17α-alkylated AAS. Major 17α-alkylated AAS include the testosterone derivatives fluoxymesterone, metandienone (methandrostenolone), and methyltestosterone and the DHT derivatives oxandrolone, <b>oxymetholone,</b> and stanozolol.|$|E
25|$|Although {{it is not}} {{commonly}} used, methyltestosterone {{is one of the}} few AAS {{that remains}} available for medical use in the United States. The others are testosterone (and esters), nandrolone decanoate, oxandrolone, <b>oxymetholone,</b> and fluoxymesterone.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used AAS in medicine are testosterone and its various esters (but {{most commonly}} testosterone undecanoate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), nandrolone esters (most commonly nandrolone decanoate and nandrolone phenylpropionate), stanozolol, and metandienone (methandrostenolone). Others also available and used commonly but {{to a lesser extent}} include methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, mesterolone, and <b>oxymetholone,</b> as well as drostanolone propionate, metenolone (methylandrostenolone), and fluoxymesterone. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT; androstanolone, stanolone) and its esters are also notable, although they are not widely used in medicine. Boldenone undecylenate and trenbolone acetate are used in veterinary medicine.|$|E
25|$|Aside from 5α-reductase, {{aromatase}} may inactivate testosterone signaling in {{skeletal muscle}} and adipose tissue, so AAS that lack aromatase affinity, {{in addition to}} being free of the potential side effect of gynecomastia, might be expected to have a higher myotrophic-androgenic ratio in comparison. In addition, DHT is inactivated by high activity of 3α-HSD in skeletal muscle (and cardiac tissue), and AAS that lack affinity for 3α-HSD could similarly be expected to have a higher myotrophic-androgenic ratio (although perhaps also increased long-term cardiovascular risks). In accordance, DHT, mesterolone (1α-methyl-DHT), and mestanolone (17α-methyl-DHT) are all described as very poorly anabolic due to inactivation by 3α-HSD in skeletal muscle, whereas other DHT derivatives like oxandrolone, <b>oxymetholone,</b> drostanolone, and stanozolol are all poor substrates for 3α-HSD and are described as potent anabolics.|$|E

50|$|Presented most {{commonly}} as a 50 mg tablet, <b>oxymetholone</b> {{is one of}} the strongest androgenic steroids available. Similarly, there is a risk of side effects. Despite very low binding affinity with the androgen receptor, <b>oxymetholone</b> is highly effective in promoting extensive gains in body mass, mostly by greatly improving protein synthesis. For this reason, it is often used by bodybuilders and athletes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{common side}} effects of <b>oxymetholone</b> include depression, lethargy, headache, swelling, rapid weight gain, priapism, changes in skin color, {{urination}} problems, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain (if taken on an empty stomach), loss of appetite, jaundice, breast swelling in men, feeling restless or excited, insomnia, and diarrhea. [...] In women, side effects also include acne, changes in menstrual periods, deepened voice, hair growth on the chin or chest, male pattern baldness, enlarged clitoris, and changes in sex drive. Because of its 17α-alkylated structure, <b>oxymetholone</b> is highly hepatotoxic. Long term use of the drug can cause a variety of serious ailments, including hepatitis, liver cancer, and cirrhosis; therefore periodic liver function tests are recommended for those taking <b>oxymetholone.</b>|$|E

50|$|Like other AAS, <b>oxymetholone</b> is an agonist of the {{androgen}} receptor (AR). It {{is not a}} substrate for 5α-reductase and is a poor substrate for 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD), and therefore shows a high ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity.|$|E
50|$|The {{drug was}} {{approved}} for human {{use by the}} FDA.

50|$|Mestanolone, {{also known}} as 17α-methyl-5α-dihydrotestosterone (17α-methyl-DHT) or as 17α-methyl-5α-androstan-17β-ol-3-one, is a synthetic, 17α-alkylated androstane steroid and a {{derivative}} of DHT differing from it only {{in the presence of}} a methyl group at the C17α position.

Other causes of non-cyclical breast pain include alcoholism with liver damage (likely due to abnormal steroid metabolism), mastitis and medications such as digitalis, methyldopa (an antihypertensive), spironolactone, certain diuretics, <b>oxymetholone</b> (an anabolic steroid), and chlorpromazine (a typical antipsychotic).

40|$|Background and {{objectives}} Sarcopenia {{is common in}} hemodialysis patients. This study examined whether the anabolic steroid <b>oxymetholone</b> improves muscle mass and handgrip strength in hemodialysis patients and possible mechanisms that might engender such changes. Design, setting, participants, &measurements Forty-three eligible hemodialysis patientswere randomly assigned to ingest <b>oxymetholone</b> or placebo for 24 weeks. Body composition, handgrip strength, {{and quality of life}} were measured during the study. Muscle biopsieswere performed and analyzed formRNA levels formyostatin, IGF-I, IGF binding proteins, and myosin heavy chains and protein expression. Muscle fiber types and diameter were assessed by reduced nicotinamide–adenine dinucleotide staining. Results There was a significantly greater increase in fat-free mass and handgrip strength and decrease in fat mass in the <b>oxymetholone</b> comparedwith the placebo group. Moreover, comparedwith baseline values, patients given <b>oxymetholone</b> exhibited an increase in fat-free mass, handgrip strength, physical functioning scores, and type I muscle fiber cross-sectional area and a decrease in fat mass, whereas patients receiving placebo did not undergo changes. There was a significantly greater increase in muscle mRNA levels for myosin heavy chain 23, IGF-I, and IGF-II receptor with <b>oxymetholone</b> treatment than placebo. Liver enzyme rose significantly in the <b>oxymetholone</b> group, but the number of values greater than three times the upper limit of normal were not different between these groups. Conclusions In hemodialysis patients, ingesting <b>oxymetholone</b> was associated with an increase in fat-free mass, handgrip strength, and muscle mRNA levels for several growth factors and a decrease in fat mass, but it also induced liver injury...|$|E
40|$|Abstract] Methandienone, methandriol, and <b>oxymetholone,</b> {{which are}} {{anabolic}} steroids possessing 1 7 a-methyl and 171 S-hydroxy groups, were developed as oral formulations for therapeutic purposes. However, {{they have been}} used in racehorses to enhance racing performance. In humans, {{it has been reported that}} structurally related anabolic steroids having the 17 a-methyl and 171 ~hydroxy groups, including 17 a-methyltestosterone, mestanolone, methandienone, methandriol, and <b>oxymetholone,</b> have metabolites in common. In this study, we found that metabolites common to those of 17 a-methyltestosterone and mestanolone were detected in horse urine after the administration of <b>oxymetholone,</b> methandienone, and methandriol. Based on analytical data, we confirmed these to be the common metabolites of five structurally related steroids, 17 o. -methyltestosterone, mestanolone, <b>oxymetholone,</b> methandienone, and methandriol. Furthermore, wedetected hitherto unknown urinary metabolites of methandriol and <b>oxymetholone</b> in horses. The parent steroid itself was detected in horse urine after the administration of methandriol, other than metabolites common to 17 a-methyltestosterone and mestanolone. O the other hand, the major metabolite of <b>oxymetholone</b> was mestanolone, aside from metabolites presumed to be the stereoisomers of 2 -hydroxymethyl- 17 o. -methyl- 5 o. -androstan- 3, 17 l]-diol and 2, 1 7 a-di(hydroxymethyl) - 5 a-androstan- 3, 1 71 ~-diol. The simultaneous detection f common metabolites and other main metabolites would help us narrow down the candidate-administered steroid for the doping tests in racehorses...|$|E
40|$|<b>Oxymetholone</b> is {{generally}} {{assumed to be}} a nongenotoxic carcinogen. This assumption is based primarily on the results of an Ames test, existing data in repeat-dose toxicology studies, and the predicted results of a 2 -yr National Toxicology Program (NTP) rat carcinogenicity bioassay. To provide a comprehensive assessment of its genotoxicity in a standard battery of mutagenicity assays, <b>oxymetholone</b> was tested in microbial and mammalian cell gene mutation assays, in an i vitro cytogenetics assay (human lympho-cytes), and in an in vivo micronucleus assay. <b>Oxymetholone</b> was also tested in an in vitro morphologic transformation model using Syrian hamster embryo (SHE) cells.
