500|$|A special {{subcommittee}} of the Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Warfare (CSSAW), known as the MAUD Committee, was created to investigate the matter further. It was chaired by Sir George Thomson and its <b>original</b> <b>membership</b> included Chadwick, along with Mark Oliphant, John Cockcroft and Philip Moon. While other teams investigated uranium enrichment techniques, Chadwick's team at Liverpool concentrated on determining the nuclear cross section of uranium-235. By April 1941, it had been experimentally confirmed that the critical mass of uranium-235 might be [...] or less. His research into such matters was complicated by all-but-incessant Luftwaffe bombings of the environs of his Liverpool lab; the windows were blown out so often that they were replaced by cardboard.|$|E

500|$|At the University of Birmingham in March 1940, Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls {{examined}} the theoretical {{issues involved in}} developing, producing and using atomic bombs in a paper that {{became known as the}} Frisch–Peierls memorandum. They considered what would happen to a sphere of pure uranium-235, and found that not only could a chain reaction occur, but it might require as little as [...] of uranium-235 to unleash the energy of hundreds of tons of TNT. The first person they showed their paper to was Oliphant, and he immediately took it to Sir Henry Tizard, the chairman of the Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Warfare (CSSAW). As a result, a special subcommittee of the CSSAW known as the MAUD Committee was created to investigate the matter further. It was chaired by Sir George Thomson, and its <b>original</b> <b>membership</b> included Oliphant, Chadwick, Cockcroft and Moon. In its final report in July 1941, the MAUD Committee concluded that an atomic bomb was not only feasible, but might be produced as early as 1943.|$|E

Pancu's movement, whose <b>original</b> <b>membership</b> did not exceed 40, attempted to revive loyalism within the proletariat (while offering an alternative to communism by promising to advocate increased labor rights). As much as other reactionary groups, it won the tacit support of General Alexandru Averescu and his increasingly popular People's Party (of which Cuza became an affiliate); Averescu's ascension to power in 1920 engendered a new period of social troubles in the larger urban areas (see Labor movement in Romania).|$|E

50|$|According to the Chicago Tribune, the {{exchange}} was founded after {{the discovery of}} Nevada's Cornstock lode, and on September 11, 1862, forty founders each paid $50 to form a central market for gold and silver shares.
