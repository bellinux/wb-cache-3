5|$|Linear probing is a {{component}} of <b>open</b> <b>addressing</b> schemes for using a hash table to solve the dictionary problem. In the dictionary problem, a data structure should maintain a collection of key–value pairs subject to operations that insert or delete pairs from the collection or that search for the value associated with a given key.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{quadratic}} probing {{and double}} hashing, linear probing {{is a form}} of <b>open</b> <b>addressing.</b> In these schemes, each cell of a hash table stores a single key–value pair. When the hash function causes a collision by mapping a new key to a cell of the hash table that is already occupied by another key, linear probing searches the table for the closest following free location and inserts the new key there. Lookups are performed in the same way, by searching the table sequentially starting at the position given by the hash function, until finding a cell with a matching key or an empty cell.|$|E
5|$|Linear probing {{provides}} good locality of reference, {{which causes}} it to require few uncached memory accesses per operation. Because of this, for low to moderate load factors, {{it can provide}} very high performance. However, compared to some other <b>open</b> <b>addressing</b> strategies, its performance degrades more quickly at high load factors because of primary clustering, a tendency for one collision to cause more nearby collisions. Additionally, achieving good performance with this method requires a higher-quality hash function than for some other collision resolution schemes. When used with low-quality hash functions that fail to eliminate nonuniformities in the input distribution, linear probing can be slower than other open-addressing strategies such as double hashing, which probes a sequence of cells whose separation is determined by a second hash function, or quadratic probing, where the size of each step varies depending on its position within the probe sequence.|$|E

500|$|... {{summarizes}} {{the early history}} of linear probing. It was the first <b>open</b> <b>addressing</b> method, and was originally synonymous with <b>open</b> <b>addressing.</b> According to Knuth, it was first used by Gene Amdahl, Elaine M. McGraw (née Boehme), and Arthur Samuel in 1954, in an assembler program for the IBM 701 computer. The first published description of linear probing is by , who also credits Samuel, Amdahl, and Boehme but adds that [...] "the system is so natural, that it very likely may have been conceived independently by others either before or since that time". Another early publication of this method was by Soviet researcher Andrey Ershov, in 1958.|$|E
500|$|In <b>open</b> <b>addressing</b> {{solutions}} to this problem, the data structure is an array [...] (the hash table) whose cells [...] (when nonempty) each store a single key–value pair. A hash function {{is used to}} map each key into the cell of [...] where that key should be stored, typically scrambling the keys so that keys with similar values are not placed near {{each other in the}} table. A hash collision occurs when the hash function maps a key into a cell that is already occupied by a different key. Linear probing is a strategy for resolving collisions, by placing the new key into the closest following empty cell.|$|E
50|$|Like {{all other}} forms of <b>open</b> <b>addressing,</b> double hashing becomes linear as the hash table {{approaches}} maximum capacity. The only solution to this is to rehash to a larger size, as with all other <b>open</b> <b>addressing</b> schemes.|$|E

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, normal <b>open</b> <b>addressing</b> {{is a poor}} choice for large {{elements}}, because these elements fill entire CPU cache lines (negating the cache advantage), and {{a large amount of}} space is wasted on large empty table slots. If the <b>open</b> <b>addressing</b> table only stores references to elements (external storage), it uses space comparable to chaining even for large records but loses its speed advantage.|$|E
5000|$|This {{strategy}} is effective, efficient, and {{very easy to}} implement. However, sometimes the extra memory use might be prohibitive, and the most common alternative, <b>open</b> <b>addressing,</b> has uncomfortable disadvantages that decrease performance. The primary disadvantage of <b>open</b> <b>addressing</b> is primary and secondary clustering, in which searches may access long sequences of used buckets that contain items with different hash addresses; items with one hash address can thus lengthen searches for items with other hash addresses.|$|E
