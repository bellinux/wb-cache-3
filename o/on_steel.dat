5|$|Manganese {{phosphating}} is {{used for}} rust and corrosion prevention <b>on</b> <b>steel.</b> Ionized manganese is used industrially as pigments of various colors, which depend on the oxidation state of the ions. The permanganates of alkali and alkaline earth metals are powerful oxidizers. Manganese dioxide is used as the cathode (electron acceptor) material in zinc-carbon and alkaline batteries.|$|E
5|$|Vanadium traces in diesel fuels are {{the main}} fuel {{component}} in high temperature corrosion. During combustion, vanadium oxidizes and reacts with sodium and sulfur, yielding vanadate compounds with melting points as low as 530°C, which attack the passivation layer <b>on</b> <b>steel</b> and render it susceptible to corrosion. The solid vanadium compounds also abrade engine components.|$|E
5|$|At {{the south}} eastern {{corner of the}} eastern terrace is the former pumping station, {{associated}} tunnels {{and a set of}} 1850s workshops within an enclosing wall. Underneath parts of the eastern terrace, the adjacent Hampton Road, the pumping station and the workshops there are a complex series of shafts, drives and weirs cut from the rock during the 1890s and early twentieth century. The east workshops is a single storey limestone building on the western side with an enclosed area to the east. The entire workshops yard was roofed using a light steel truss <b>on</b> <b>steel</b> supports in 1960.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the {{production}} of Borazon, diamond was the preferred abrasive used for grinding very hard superalloys but it could not be used effectively <b>on</b> <b>steels</b> because carbon tends to dissolve in iron at high temperatures. Aluminium oxide was the conventional abrasive used <b>on</b> hardened <b>steel</b> tools.|$|R
30|$|Following {{publication}} of the original article (Khelissa et al. 2017), the authors reported that the legend for Fig.  3 contained an error. Instead of “Adhesion of planktonic and biofilm-detached Staphylococcus aureus cells <b>on</b> stainless <b>steel</b> and polycarbonate.

5|$|Cadmium {{occurs as}} a minor {{component}} in most zinc ores and is a byproduct of zinc production. Cadmium was used {{for a long time}} as a corrosion-resistant plating <b>on</b> <b>steel,</b> and cadmium compounds are used as red, orange and yellow pigments, to colour glass, and to stabilize plastic. Cadmium use is generally decreasing because it is toxic (it is specifically listed in the European Restriction of Hazardous Substances) and nickel-cadmium batteries have been replaced with nickel-metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries. One of its few new uses is cadmium telluride solar panels.|$|E
5|$|CharlesH.Holt {{arrived in}} San Francisco from Concord, New Hampshire, in 1864 to form C.H.Holt and Co. Initially the company {{produced}} wooden wheels for wagons and, later <b>on,</b> <b>steel</b> wheels for streetcars. In 1869, at age 20, {{his younger brother}} Benjamin {{went to work in}} their father's sawmill in New Hampshire along with William Harrison Holt and Ames Frank Holt, preparing hardwoods for shipping to Charles in San Francisco. William and Ames joined Charles in San Francisco in 1871.|$|E
5|$|Copper, zinc, tin, {{and lead}} are {{mechanically}} weaker metals but have useful corrosion prevention properties. While {{each of them}} will react with air, the resulting patinas of either various copper salts, zinc carbonate, tin oxide, or a mixture of lead oxide, carbonate, and sulfate, confer valuable protective properties. Copper and lead are therefore used, for example, as roofing materials; zinc acts as an anti-corrosion agent in galvanised steel; and tin serves a similar purpose <b>on</b> <b>steel</b> cans.|$|E

5|$|Argon is also {{commonly}} {{mixed with}} other gases, oxygen, helium, hydrogen and nitrogen. The addition {{of up to}} 5% oxygen (like the higher concentrations of carbon dioxide mentioned above) {{can be helpful in}} welding stainless steel, however, in most applications carbon dioxide is preferred. Increased oxygen makes the shielding gas oxidize the electrode, which can lead to porosity in the deposit if the electrode does not contain sufficient deoxidizers. Excessive oxygen, especially when used in application for which it is not prescribed, can lead to brittleness in the heat affected zone. Argon-helium mixtures are extremely inert, and can be used on nonferrous materials. A helium concentration of 50–75% raises the required voltage and increases the heat in the arc, due to helium's higher ionization temperature. Hydrogen is sometimes added to argon in small concentrations (up to about 5%) for welding nickel and thick stainless steel workpieces. In higher concentrations (up to 25% hydrogen), it may be used for welding conductive materials such as copper. However, it should not be used <b>on</b> <b>steel,</b> aluminum or magnesium because it can cause porosity and hydrogen embrittlement.|$|E
5|$|Early wagons {{were built}} on four wheeled under frames, but from 1871 bogie {{vehicles}} begun to appear. These early wagons were of all wood construction, but later types had wooden bodies <b>on</b> <b>steel</b> underframes, then followed by all steel wagons. Groups of wagons {{of the same}} design are classed together by a multiple character alphabetical code, initially in a system restricted to Victoria only, but from 1979 the Railways of Australia four letter coding was introduced. Under this system the first letter represent owner of the wagon, the second represents the general type of wagon, the third separates different classes of the same general type, and the four letter indicates the maximum running speed.|$|E
5|$|In the Senate, {{the most}} {{prominent}} fight was over {{the need for a}} strong protective tariff, which made foreign goods more expensive but encouraged domestic manufacturing. Payne supported a high tariff, but thought some small reductions would be prudent {{in order to reduce the}} federal government's surplus. He joined fellow Senate Democrats in rejecting a tariff bill proposed by Iowa Republican William B. Allison, which would have raised the rates even higher than Payne thought prudent. His only contribution to the debate was to argue against a reduction in the tariff <b>on</b> <b>steel</b> and iron. This Allison bill passed the Republican-controlled Senate, but failed to pass in the House, which was controlled by Democrats.|$|E

5|$|On the interior, Strickland {{placed the}} grand {{staircase}} {{that connects the}} three levels immediately behind the portico in the central core of the structure. The floor system is composed of fired-clay jack arches supported <b>on</b> <b>steel</b> I-beams, a common feature of warehouses and other long-span structures. On the second floor, many of the larger rooms, which were used for coining and melting, contain ceilings with beautiful high arches supported by the walls and freestanding piers. The smaller rectangular rooms on the second level (and the basement), such as the former superintendent's office, also contain these arched ceilings with a single groin vault. The basement formerly contained the boilers inside a brick cage, but now contain museum exhibits devoted to the minting processes {{as well as the}} Coin Vault at the Mint, a coin shop.|$|E
5|$|The {{most notable}} {{feature of the}} chamber is the roof. The roof is {{supported}} by a structure of laminated oak beams joined with a total of 112 stainless steel connectors (each slightly different), which in turn are suspended <b>on</b> <b>steel</b> rods from the walls. The connecting nodes were fabricated by welders for Scotland's oil industry. Such a structure enables the debating chamber to span over 30metres (100ft) without any supporting columns. In entering the chamber, MSPs pass under a stone lintel—the Arniston Stone—that was once part of the pre-1707 Parliament building, Parliament House. The use of the Arniston Stone {{in the structure of the}} debating chamber symbolises the connection between the historical Parliament of Scotland and the present day Scottish Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The {{trend of}} {{accelerating}} {{the speed at}} which welds are performed in the steel erection industry comes at a risk to the integrity of the connection. Without proper fusion to the base materials provided by sufficient arc time on the weld, a project inspector cannot ensure the effective diameter of the puddle weld therefore he or she cannot guarantee the published load capacities unless they witness the actual installation. This method of puddle welding is common in the United States and Canada for attaching steel sheets to bar joist and structural steel members. Regional agencies are responsible for ensuring the proper installation of puddle welding <b>on</b> <b>steel</b> construction sites. Currently there is no standard or weld procedure which can ensure the published holding capacity of any unwitnessed connection, but this is under review by the American Welding Society.|$|E
