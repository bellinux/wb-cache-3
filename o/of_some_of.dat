5|$|Although Hazlitt had {{reviewed}} {{a performance}} of Measure for Measure for The Examiner on 11 February 1816, and incorporated a few passages, with modifications, into this chapter, including some of his general philosophical reflections and a mention <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Schlegel's opinions, yet he says nothing in Characters of Shakespear's Plays about any stage performances of this play.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the site}} was {{restored}} during the archaeological investigations, it suffered considerable damage in the 1976 Guatemala earthquake. This resulted in destruction <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the restoration work, {{although some of the}} damage has now been repaired.|$|E

5|$|Among the adapiforms, frugivory {{seems to}} have been the most common diet, {{particularly}} for medium-sized to large species, such as Cantius, Pelycodus and Cercamonius. Folivory was also common among the medium and large-sized adapiforms, including Smilodectes, Notharctus, Adapis and Leptadapis. Sharp cusps on the teeth <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the smaller adapiforms, such as Anchomomys and Donrussellia, indicate that they were either partly or primarily insectivorous.|$|E
5|$|Ancient texts {{reveal the}} names and deeds <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the most notable law professors at the Beirut school. The scarce sources include {{historical}} accounts, juridic works, anthologies, ancient correspondences and funerary inscriptions.|$|E
5|$|As {{examples}} <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the world's {{most important}} records and first printed matter, researchers will find herbals scattered through the world's most famous libraries including the Vatican Library in Rome, the Bodleian Library in Oxford, the Royal Library in Windsor, the British Library in London {{and the major}} continental libraries.|$|E

30|$|In 2012, Gao [14 – 16] also {{investigated}} {{the growth and}} existence <b>of</b> meromorphic solutions <b>of</b> <b>some</b> systems <b>of</b> complex difference equations and obtained some existence theorems and estimates on the proximity function and the counting function <b>of</b> solutions <b>of</b> <b>some</b> systems <b>of</b> complex difference equations.|$|R
5|$|At Saint Cloud, the furs <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> {{the cart}} brigades were transshipped to river craft on the Mississippi, which {{operated}} to Saint Anthony Falls at Minneapolis. Other cart trains crossed the Mississippi and travelled on to Saint Paul on a route {{shared with the}} Woods Trail.|$|E
5|$|Attalea {{includes}} both large trees and small acaulescent palms which occupy {{a number of}} different ecological niches. Dense stands <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the larger species are conspicuous elements on the landscape, while smaller species are found in both in the forest understorey and in savannas.|$|E

50|$|Jacques-Cartier grew {{extremely}} quickly, {{much too}} fast for its existing infrastructure. It lacked a sewer system and paved roads. Dogs ran wildly in the streets. Houses were built {{as soon as the}} owner had the materials required to make one. The city had few or no laws on architectural integrity. This led to a mishmash <b>of</b> buildings, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> concrete, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> wood, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> brick, along its streets.|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} the question which structures occur as fixed structures of stable structures with a generic automorphism. Among others we give a Galois theoretic characterisation. As application we prove: Any pseudofinite field is the fixed field <b>of</b> <b>some</b> model <b>of</b> ACFA. Any one-free pseudo-differentially closed field of characteristic zero is the fixed field <b>of</b> <b>some</b> model <b>of</b> DCFA. Any one-free PAC field of finite degree of imperfection is the fixed field <b>of</b> <b>some</b> model <b>of</b> SCFA...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{determine}} self-orthogonal {{designs and}} self-orthogonal codes from the primitive {{representations of the}} projective symplectic groups S 4 (3) and S 4 (4), respectively. We establish <b>some</b> properties <b>of</b> these codes and the nature <b>of</b> <b>some</b> classes <b>of</b> codewords. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> the codes are optimal or near optimal for the given length and dimension. The dual codes <b>of</b> <b>some</b> designs and those <b>of</b> <b>some</b> complementary designs admit majority logic decoding...|$|R
5|$|Burgoyne's failed campaign, {{as may be}} seen by {{the titles}} <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the books that cover it in detail, marked a major turning point in the war. After the battle, he withdrew his men 10–15 miles north, near present-day Schuylerville, New York. General Burgoyne {{returned}} to England and was never given another commanding position in the British Army.|$|E
5|$|Five sculptors {{executed}} {{a total of}} thirteen such scenes, {{not only on the}} front and back walls of zoo buildings, but also on all four sides of both brick entrance shelters at Flatbush Avenue. However, the positioning <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the bas-reliefs makes them less accessible than others.|$|E
5|$|If Gage did not dip {{his hand}} {{unnecessarily}} {{in the public}} till, he did engage in the relatively common practices of nepotism and political favouritism. In addition to securing advantageous positions for several people named Gage or Kemble, he also apparently assisted in the placement <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his friends and political supporters, or their children.|$|E

50|$|And Isis answer made: Of living things, my son, {{some are}} {{made friends with}} fire, and some with water, some with air, and some with earth, and some {{with two or three}} <b>of</b> these, and <b>some</b> with all. And, on the contrary, again <b>some</b> are made enemies <b>of</b> fire, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> water, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> earth, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> air, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> two <b>of</b> them, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> three, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> all. For instance, son, the locust and all flies flee fire; the eagle and the hawk and all high-flying birds flee water; fish, air and earth; the snake avoids the open air. Whereas snakes and all {{creeping}} things love earth; all swimming things love water; winged things, air, of which they are the citizens; while those that fly still higher love the fire and have the habitat near it. Not that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the animals as well do not love fire; for instance salamanders, for they even have their homes in it. It is because one or another of the elements doth form their bodies' outer envelope. Each soul, accordingly, while it is in its body is weighted and constricted by these four.|$|R

5|$|In 1966, Reines took {{most of his}} {{neutrino}} {{research team}} {{with him when he}} left for the new University of California, Irvine (UCI), becoming its first dean of physical sciences. At UCI, Reines extended the research interests <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his graduate students into the development of medical radiation detectors, such as for measuring total radiation delivered to the whole human body in radiation therapy.|$|E
5|$|In March 2009, The Times in {{conjunction}} with iTunes released a selection of live recordings by Noel Gallagher taken from his semi-acoustic performance at the Royal Albert Hall on 27 March 2007 in aid of Teenage Cancer Trust. The Dreams We Have as Children features classic and rare tracks from the Oasis canon along with several cover versions <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Gallagher's favourite artists.|$|E

30|$|After his works, Gao [15, 16], Xu et al. [17] further {{investigated}} {{the growth and}} existence <b>of</b> meromorphic solutions <b>of</b> <b>some</b> types <b>of</b> systems of complex functional equations and obtained a series of results (see [15, 16, 18, 19]). Inspired by the ideas of Refs.

5|$|In some cases, yes, I {{think it}} has in terms <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the stuff {{they did in the}} Middle East {{supporting}} the pro-democracy demonstrators. But a lot of bad things too, unnecessarily harassing people – I would class that as a bad thing. DDOSing the CIA website, stealing customer data and posting it online just for shits and giggles is not a good thing.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, public {{opposition}} to the planned demolition <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the historic structures downtown like the McCarthy Building led to them being placed on the then-new National Register. In the early 1970s, the five predecessor historic districts were recognized and added as well, along with some other structures.|$|E
5|$|It seems hardly {{likely that}} we are even to-day so lukewarm in our {{interest}} in letters or serious discussion as to be content to reduce our treatment of sex to the standard of a child's library in the supposed interest of a salacious few, or that shame will for long prevent us from adequate portrayal <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the most serious and beautiful sides of human nature.|$|E
