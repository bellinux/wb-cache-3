5|$|In the series' story, the Nemesis is {{the result}} of infecting a Tyrant — a {{humanoid}} bio-weapon created to be the ultimate lifeform—with a parasitic organism designed to increase its intelligence. Upon infection, the parasite takes control of the Tyrant's nervous system, forming its own brain and enabling it to follow precise instructions and make decisions without a need for constant direction. Clothed in black trousers, an overcoat, boots, and gloves, the Nemesis is armed with a rocket launcher mounted on its left arm. To emphasize its design as a prototype, the game developers left exposed muscles on its body and added stitches to cover the right eye. Upon spotting its target, it says the target's name <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> attacks.|$|E

25|$|The cantorial {{style of}} the Spanish and Portuguese Jews adheres to the general Sephardi {{principle}} that every word is sung <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> {{that most of the}} ritual is performed communally rather than solistically (although nowadays in the New York community, the Pesukei dezimra (zemirot) throughout the year, Hallél on festivals or the new moon, and several of the selichot during Yom Kippur are chanted in a manner more similar to the Ashkenazi practice of reading only the first and last few verses of each paragraph aloud). The hazzan's rôle is typically one of guiding the congregation rather than being a soloist. Thus, there is traditionally a much stronger emphasis on correct diction and knowledge of the musical minhág than on the solistic voice quality. In the parts of the service where the ḥazzán would traditionally have a more solistic rôle, the basic melodies are embellished according to the general principles of Baroque performance practice: for example, after a prayer or hymn sung by the congregation, the ḥazzán often repeats the last line in a highly elaborated form. Two- and three-part harmony is relatively common, and Edwin Seroussi has shown that the harmonies are a reflection of more complex, four-part harmonies in written sources from the 18th century.|$|E

He often thinks <b>out</b> <b>loud,</b> <b>and</b> {{comments}} and complains on the absurdity of his situations, a tendency Matt Casamassina of IGN called [...] "lighthearted and amusing". Drake's appearance is generic, usually appearing in a plain shirt and jeans. This was to make him seem like an [...] "ordinary guy". Throughout the series, he has various romantic interests. In the first game, there is tension between him and Elena Fisher, a reporter filming a documentary on his findings.

500|$|With time, Tristan Tzara merged his {{performances}} and his literature, {{taking part in}} developing Dada's [...] "simultaneist poetry", which {{was meant to be}} read <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> involved a collaborative effort, being, according to Hans Arp, the first instance of Surrealist automatism. Ball stated that the subject of such pieces was [...] "the value of the human voice." [...] Together with Arp, Tzara and Walter Serner produced the German-language Die Hyperbel vom Krokodilcoiffeur und dem Spazierstock ("The Hyperbole of the Crocodile's Hairdresser and the Walking-Stick"), in which, Arp stated, [...] "the poet crows, curses, sighs, stutters, yodels, as he pleases. His poems are like Nature [...] a tiny particle is as beautiful and important as a star." [...] Another noted simultaneist poem was L'Amiral cherche une maison à louer ("The Admiral Is Looking for a House to Rent"), co-authored by Tzara, Marcel Janco and Huelsenbach.|$|E
500|$|Dave Foster of DVD Times said: [...] "Once again {{showing the}} mischievous {{relationship}} Bart and Homer share their pranks {{and the inevitable}} confrontations with George Bush Senior are as hilarious as they are implausible and frequent, but {{there is much to}} love about this episode in which the writers think <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> paint The Simpsons and its characters as Bush once did." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and said that it [...] "offers the kind of episode that only The Simpsons could pull off well. The idea of bringing a president to live in Springfield is high-concept to say the least, and it could– and probably should– have bombed. However, the silliness works well and turns this into a great show." [...] John Thorpe of Central Michigan Life named it the second best episode of the series, and Rich Weir of AskMen.com named it the ninth best episode.|$|E
500|$|Despite not {{charting}} {{in mainland}} Europe, and not selling very well initially, The Holy Bible received significant critical acclaim {{when it was}} released in August 1994, and in the years following. Simon Williams of NME saw The Holy Bible as primarily the work of James Dean Bradfield, saying [...] "The Holy Bible isn't elegant, but it is bloody effective". Melody Maker, seeing it as primarily the work of Richey Edwards, described it as [...] "the sound of a group in extremis [...] hurtling towards a private armageddon". Observed Roy Wilkinson in Select: [...] "Amid all the references to coma, carcasses, 'walking abortions' and dying in the summer sits the spectre of Richey, {{holed up in a}} private clinic, having drunk too much, eaten too little and cut himself for reasons varying between dramatic gesture, a surrogate for screaming <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> something 'sexual' [...] Let's hope that, with a record of such unsettling, morbid resonance as The Holy Bible, no further gestures are required." ...|$|E

[...] He shed a {{negative}} light on Andy's behavior towards Dwight, calling it [...] "annoying and not that funny." [...] Dahl hoped Dwight would be reappearing soon, and concluded [...] "Overall, a crucial story episode with a nice cliffhanger. Even if wasn't as funny as last week or even most episodes this season, The Office still entertains." [...] AOL TV's Michael Sciannamea lauded the episode, writing [...] "I cannot remember ever guffawing over every single line in a single sitcom episode as I did watching this one. If the performances in this particular one don't garner the actors in this show a plethora of Emmys, {{there ought to be}} an investigation." [...] Sciannamea continued that he believed it was Steve Carell's best series performance thus far because he [...] "displayed the full range of his personality—jokester, arrogant jerk, charming salesman, sensitive soul, and added a new one—anger." ...|$|E
500|$|Matt Roush of TV Guide wrote favorably about [...] "At Long Last Leave", {{describing}} it as a [...] "keeper" [...] and highlighting the [...] "dazzling opening sequence". He concluded that The Simpsons [...] "once again delivers the goods, proving {{itself to be}} a classic for our age and for the ages." [...] Childs was less positive, writing that the episode is [...] "nothing special" [...] as [...] "all of the elements seem drawn from earlier stories" [...] and [...] "only {{a few of the}} jokes rise to the lowered bar of latter-day Simpsons humor." [...] He added, however, that [...] "nothing in the episode goes outrageously wrong, either. There is little Family Guy-style stupidity and randomness, the satire is gently pointed inward, and the guest star, while splashy for his controversiality, does not hijack the plot—instead appearing for a single joke before vanishing." [...] TIME critic James Poniewozik commented that [...] "At Long Last Leave" [...] was an [...] "all right" [...] episode, noting that certain gags felt [...] "forced by the writers’ room". Poniewozik, who thinks the quality of The Simpsons declined {{at the end of the}} 1990s, added however that [...] "a few moments made me bark <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> realize why I loved the show in the first place." ...|$|E

[...] The Times of India also rated it four out of five: [...] "It introduces the most outrageous scenes in popular Hindi cinema and manages {{to get away with it}} because it's all done with an infectious zest and effervescence that keeps the ribs tickling." [...] Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph rated the film 7.2 out of 10, writing that Dostana [...] "can make you laugh <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> also strike an emotional chord." [...] Raam Tarat of Future Movies rated the film 3.5 out of 5, praising its performances ("The lead actors share a great chemistry, are easy on the eye and oh so charming that they, along with beautiful Miami make for a visual treat") and calling it [...] "a great, fun entertainer with lots of charm and great music." [...] For Hindustan Times, film critic Khalid Mohamed gave Dostana a three-out-of-five rating: [...] "Good taste, pop colour Miami locations, high-end costumes, make-up styling and the A-grade Dharma Productions values add up to a zingy entertainer".|$|E

It took Lieberstein and Celotta {{four or five days}} to write this episode. Writer Anthony Farrell said that the idea for Dunder Mifflin Infinity to fail was {{inspired}} by the days that he was an administrative assistant for Countrywide Home Loans. Farrell recalled watching the company try new online initiatives and seeing them all be unsuccessful. The talking head interview wherein Michael compares Holly to a baker came after what the writers call [...] "blitzes", in which all the writers write a talking head on a specific topic, such as [...] "Michael's feelings to Holly". Then they all read all of them <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> see which one gets the biggest reaction. The YouTube video of Ryan being arrested was set on a private account. After [...] "Goodbye, Toby" [...] aired, the video was released to the public. When writing the story for the episode, the show originally planned on having Dwight put a badger in Holly's car, but after finding out that it was difficult to get a badger, it was switched to a raccoon. The script also called for the raccoon to attack Meredith, but that was decided against for safety reasons. During one of the takes wherein Michael is singing his parody songs, Carell grabbed a guitar and played an Eddie Van Halen guitar solo, but that scene was cut because it did not match Michael's character. After filming, the editors had about 72 minutes of material that they needed to cut down into 40 minutes.|$|E
