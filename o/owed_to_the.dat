5|$|Cal Neva Resort & Casino, {{previously}} {{known as}} the Calneva Resort, Cal-Neva Lodge, is a resort and casino straddling the border between Nevada and California {{on the shores of}} Lake Tahoe.

After a fire, the building burnt down in 1937 and was rebuilt over the course of 30 days.

5|$|McNamara and {{assistant}} Simon Donnelly guided Thistle to a sixth-place finish in 2011–12 season. The following season Thistle started well and emerged as promotion candidates, competing with Dunfermline and Greenock Morton {{for a place}} in the following season's top flight. On 29 January 2013 the club gave permission to Dundee United to speak to McNamara about becoming their new manager. The following day McNamara and his assistant Simon Donnelly resigned, to become the new management team at United. Along with Donnelly, McNamara brought goalkeeper Craig Hinchcliffe, Paul Paton and Chris Erskine to Tannadice. Thistle were second in the league at the time and, because McNamara was under contract, compensation was <b>owed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> club.|$|E

5|$|The first {{records of}} Sauvey Castle date around 1216, during the First Barons' War, when the {{government}} of the young Henry III ordered the royal castle to be surrendered to William de Fors, the Count of Aumale. The count established a power base in the region, but in 1218 William Marshal, the regent, ordered him to return it to the Crown; the count declined. Further demands followed until, in 1220, royal forces besieged and took the count's castle at nearby Rockingham. In a face-saving solution, the count finally returned Sauvey to the King, supposedly of his own free will, in exchange for the cancellation of any debts that he might have <b>owed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Crown.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} first {{announced}} by Rockstar Games on March 3, 2006.

The game was released for the Xbox 360 on May 23, 2006 in North America, and on May 26, 2006 in Europe. On July 18, 2007, Rockstar announced that the game would be ported to the Wii, {{taking advantage of the}} motion sensing Wii Remote.

5|$|The {{northern}} pintail is a bird of open wetlands which nests on the ground, often {{some distance from}} water. It feeds by dabbling for plant food and adds small invertebrates to its diet during the nesting season. It is highly gregarious when not breeding, forming large mixed flocks with other species of duck. This duck's population is affected by predators, parasites and avian diseases. Human activities, such as agriculture, hunting and fishing, have also {{had a significant impact}} on numbers. Nevertheless, <b>owed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> huge range and large population of this species, it is not threatened globally.|$|E

They record not only payments made to the government, but debts <b>owed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crown and disbursements made by royal officials. Although they recorded much of the royal income, they did not record all types of income, nor did they record all expenditures, so they are not strictly speaking a budget. The Pipe Roll Society, formed in 1883, has published the Pipe rolls up until 1224.|$|E

5|$|A similar, strong {{competition}} was established very probably between Gasparo Cairano and Antonio della Porta (Tamagnino), who debuted in Brescia (in documentary terms) along with Cairano with his cycle of twelve Angels {{for the first}} dome of the Santa Maria dei Miracoli, between 24 December 1489 and May 3, 1490. It {{is not clear what}} brought this Milanese artist to Brescia. He belonged to a family of sculptors, and between 1484 and 1489 was known to have worked in Milan and Pavia for the Sforza, in close contact with Giovanni Antonio Amadeo. His debut as a figurative sculptor at the Santa Maria dei Miracoli, however, <b>owed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sanmicheli, who typically specialized in the field of decorative sculpture and lacked outside of this field. Note that Gasparo Cairano himself also first appeared on the art scene as a figurative sculptor under the Sanmicheli: he created his sequence of twelve Apostles at the same project.|$|E
5|$|At {{some unknown}} date the {{symbolic}} snowball and calf tokens <b>owed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Campbells were commuted to payment of money rent which {{increased over the}} years. In 1806, the chief was forced to relinquish the tenancy of Glen Noe due to inability to meet the payments. The chief and his family emigrated to the United States, where the family continues to reside. Although {{the identities of the}} chiefs were always known to interested clan members, the chiefship of the clan was not officially recognized by Scottish authorities until 1991, when the coat of arms of James Wallace MacIntyre of Glenoe was confirmed by the Lord Lyon, King of Arms. The current chief of the clan is Donald Russell MacIntyre of Glenoe. The MacIntyre chiefs hold membership in the Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Harding took office, there were calls from foreign governments for {{reduction}} of the massive war debt <b>owed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States, and the German government sought to reduce the reparations that it was required to pay. The U.S. refused to consider any multilateral settlement. Harding sought passage of a plan proposed by Mellon to give the administration broad authority to reduce war debts in negotiation, but Congress, in 1922, passed a more restrictive bill. Hughes negotiated an agreement for Britain to pay off its war debt over 62 years at low interest, effectively reducing {{the present value of}} the obligations. This agreement, approved by Congress in 1923, set a pattern for negotiations with other nations. Talks with Germany on reduction of reparations payments would result in the Dawes Plan of 1924.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the various}} charters, the {{provision}} of royal justice was inconsistent and driven by the needs of immediate politics: sometimes action would be taken to address a legitimate baronial complaint, on other occasions, the problem would simply be ignored. The royal eyres, courts which toured the country to provide justice at the local level, typically for those lesser barons and the gentry claiming grievances against the major lords, had little power, allowing the major barons to dominate the local justice system. The power of royal sheriffs also declined during Henry's reign. They were now often lesser men appointed by the exchequer, rather than coming from important local families, and they focused on generating revenue for the King. Their robust attempts to enforce fines and collect debts generated much unpopularity among the lower classes. Unlike his father, Henry did not exploit the large debts that the barons frequently <b>owed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Crown, and was slow to collect any sums of money due to him.|$|E
5|$|During the {{oil boom}} of the 1970s, Nigeria {{accumulated}} a significant foreign debt to finance major infrastructural investments. With the fall of oil prices during the 1980s oil glut Nigeria struggled {{to keep up with}} its loan payments and eventually defaulted on its principal debt repayments, limiting repayment to the interest portion of the loans. Arrears and penalty interest accumulated on the unpaid principal, which increased the size of the debt. After negotiations by the Nigeria authorities, in October 2005 Nigeria and its Paris Club creditors reached an agreement under which Nigeria repurchased its debt at a discount of approximately 60%. Nigeria used part of its oil profits to pay the residual 40%, freeing up at least $1.15billion annually for poverty reduction programmes. Nigeria made history in April 2006 by becoming the first African country to completely pay off its debt (estimated $30billion) <b>owed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Paris Club.|$|E
5|$|On 7 March 2005 Greater Manchester police {{announced}} that they would stop policing Wigan Athletic matches at the stadium from 2 April.

The move was part of an ongoing dispute between the police force and Dave Whelan surrounding GB£300,000 in unpaid policing costs. The police's decision would not have affected Wigan Warriors, whose games are stewarded instead of policed. The situation was temporarily resolved on 8 March with both sides reaching an agreement that would allow Athletic to play at the ground {{until the end of the}} season. Four months later, Wigan Athletic, facing the prospect of playing their home games in the Premier League in an empty stadium, grudgingly paid the money they <b>owed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> police.
