5|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> {{requirements}} {{for the existence of}} life around a star is the ability of that star to produce a terrestrial planet of sufficient mass to sustain it.

25|$|The foreign Jewish {{refugees}} in Italy were deprived <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> means of subsistence.

25|$|The {{discriminant}} is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> invariants of {{a number}} field, and occurs in several important analytic formulas such as the functional equation of the Dedekind zeta function of K, and the analytic class number formula for K. An old theorem of Hermite states {{that there are only}} finitely many number fields of bounded discriminant, however determining this quantity is still an open problem, and the subject of current research.|$|E

25|$|Taft {{condemned}} the postwar Nuremberg Trials as victor's justice under {{ex post facto}} laws, in which the people who won the war were the prosecutors, the judges, and the alleged victims, {{all at the same}} time. Taft {{condemned the}} trials as a violation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> principles of American justice and internationally accepted standards in favor of a politicized version of justice in which court proceedings became an excuse for vengeance against the defeated.|$|E
25|$|Ancient {{human remains}} and {{artifacts}} within the caves {{are protected by}} various federal and state laws. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> facts to be determined about a newly discovered artifact is its precise location and situation. Even slightly moving a prehistoric artifact contaminates it from a research perspective. Explorers are properly trained not to disturb archaeological evidence, and {{some areas of the}} cave remain out-of-bounds for even seasoned explorers, unless the subject of the trip is archaeological research on that area.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{equipment}} was significantly improved with remote central locking, heated & electrically adjustable mirrors, 2 front- and 2 sideairbags, power brakes with ABS and power windows being standard on every car. Trim levels varied for each market as did equipment levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> trims. In the United States, the badging denoted the engine variant {{and to some}} extent the equipment level, whereas in Europe engines and options could be chosen individually. In all markets more powerful versions received better or upgraded standard equipment. The T5 and R were the series high-performance models.|$|E

25|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> invariants of an {{infinite}} abelian group A is its rank: the cardinality of the maximal linearly independent subset of A. Abelian groups of rank 0 are precisely the periodic groups, while torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 are necessarily subgroups of Q {{and can be}} completely described. More generally, a torsion-free abelian group of finite rank r is a subgroup of Qr. On the other hand, the group of p-adic integers Zp is a torsion-free abelian group of infinite Z-rank and the groups Z with different n are non-isomorphic, so this invariant does not even fully capture properties of some familiar groups.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the judges}} commands, {{the dog and}} handler team walks a {{predetermined}} pattern with the dog remaining on the handler's left side and reasonably close and attentive to the handler. The dog also must automatically sit when the judge instructs the team to halt. Each sponsoring organization has different requirements for what must be included in this exercise but generally a heeling pattern must include: a left turn, a right turn, an about turn, a fast and slow section, and a halt. Heeling is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> obedience exercises and as such it is often incorporated into other exercises such as the moving stand and the figure 8. It is also how most teams will enter and move about the ring between exercises.|$|E
25|$|Glycolaldehyde, {{the first}} example of an {{interstellar}} sugar molecule, was detected in the star-forming region near the centre of our galaxy. It was discovered in 2000 by Jes Jørgensen and Jan M. Hollis. In 2012, Jørgensen's team reported the detection of glycolaldehyde in a distant star system. The molecule was found around the protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422 400 light years from Earth. Glycolaldehyde is needed to form RNA, which is similar in function to DNA. These findings suggest that complex organic molecules may form in stellar systems prior {{to the formation of}} planets, eventually arriving on young planets early in their formation. Because sugars are associated with both metabolism and the genetic code, two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> aspects of life, it is thought the discovery of extraterrestrial sugar increases the likelihood that life may exist elsewhere in our galaxy.|$|E
50|$|The Île-de-France region, {{with regards}} to public transportation, is divided in six {{concentric}} zones, the first one being <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> Paris. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> pass for Paris and its close banlieue covers zones 1-2, costing €17.20 for a one-week pass and €56.60 for a one-month pass.|$|R
5000|$|Overlock {{stitches}} {{are classified}} {{in a number}} <b>of</b> ways. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> classification is by <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> threads used in the stitch.

500|$|Billy Curtis, {{director}} of the Gender Equity Resource Center at UC Berkeley, was deeply moved by the preview; but he also looked {{at it from a}} practical perspective: [...] "I knew immediately I could use it as an educational tool for faculty, staff, administration and students.… It doesn't try to represent the entire trans experience, but it… answers some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> questions {{about what it means to}} be trans while being this great conversation starter." ...|$|E
500|$|R. L. Shaffer of IGN rated it 7.5 out of 10 {{and wrote}} that the episode [...] "played like filler" [...] but was [...] "a very good filler episode". Shaffer {{described}} the final scene with Hawking as [...] "fun" [...] and [...] "effective", although claimed some of the subplots [...] "were only so-so". Robin Pierson of The TV Critic rated the episode 36 out of 100, stating that [...] "the craft has gone from the stories and jokes in favour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> stories and punch lines." [...] Pierson thought Helberg [...] "did a nice job showing vulnerability" [...] as Howard, but that the episode overall was [...] "one utterly predictable, unimaginative joke after another." ...|$|E
