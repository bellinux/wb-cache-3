25|$|Ten {{days before}} the attack on Georgi Markov, Bulgarian defector, Vladimir Kostov survived an attack {{similar to the one}} against Markov. Kostov was {{standing}} on an escalator of the Paris metro when he felt a sting in his lower back above the belt <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>trousers.</b> He developed a fever, but recovered. After Markov's death the wound on Kostov's back was examined and a ricin-laced pellet identical to the one used against Markov was removed.|$|E
2500|$|In 1884, the 17-year-old Beatrix Potter spotted Ruskin at the Royal Academy of Arts exhibition. She {{wrote in}} her journal, [...] "Mr Ruskin {{was one of the}} most ridiculous figures I have seen. A very old hat, much necktie and aged coat buttoned up on his neck, humpbacked, not {{particularly}} clean looking. He had on high boots, and one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>trousers</b> was tucked up on the top of one. He became aware of this half way round the room, and stood on one leg to put it right, but in doing so hitched up the other trouser worse than the first one had been." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 3, 1958, at 6:15 pm, a {{few days}} before Frances was {{scheduled}} to lead a junket of editors to Brazil, the Rushmores met inside the lobby of their apartment building in a final attempt at reconciliation. Frances was due to have dinner at the Dobbins' at 8 pm. When an argument broke out between the couple, Frances left to hail a taxi. Taxi driver Edward Pearlman picked her up at Madison Avenue and 97th Street. Simultaneously, Howard entered the cab. As the two continued arguing, Pearlman ordered him out of the cab to which he replied, “I’m her husband, don’t worry about it.” “Where do you want to go?” Pearlman asked. “Take me to a police station,” Frances said. As the cab raced to the 23rd Precinct at Third and 104th, they were only two blocks away when Frances screamed, “Oh my God!” Suddenly, three gunshots fired inside the cab. Rushmore had shot his wife in {{the right side of the}} head and neck then put the pistol to his temple and shot himself. At the police station, an unregistered [...]32 Colt revolver was found in Rushmore's hand and a seven-inch commando knife inside the waistband <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>trousers.</b> Jean Dobbins speculated that her mother's refusal to take Rushmore to Brazil might have started the argument that ended in the shooting. Contrary to general expectations, Dobbs said her parents quarreled [...] "over personal things, not Rushmore's controversial public life ... 'He was very possessive, very jealous, and wanted to go everywhere with her." [...] Frances Rushmore's father, Louis Everitt, the owner of a women's shoe store in Charlotte, brought his daughter's body back to North Carolina.|$|E
60|$|He stopped short, {{and thrust}} {{his hands into}} the pockets <b>of</b> <b>his</b> checked <b>trousers.</b>|$|R
50|$|During {{his time}} in Ghana, Pfister's fame transcended football. <b>His</b> {{unconventional}} style <b>of</b> wearing <b>his</b> <b>trousers</b> on the hip, rather than the waist, has become a fashion trend among the youth.|$|R
60|$|Divested <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{gown and}} turned towards the window, Mr. Stone was already rising on his toes, {{his arms were}} extended, his palms pressed hard {{together}} in the attitude <b>of</b> prayer, <b>his</b> <b>trousers</b> slowly slipping down.|$|R
60|$|The mate {{made his}} acknowledgments, and having shaken hands, {{carefully}} wiped his down the leg <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>trousers.</b>|$|E
60|$|Psmith {{sat down}} again, {{carefully}} tucking up the knees <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>trousers,</b> {{and watched him}} with silent interest through his eyeglass.|$|E
6000|$|... --Thank you, sir, Stephen said, {{gathering}} the money together with shy haste {{and putting it}} all in a pocket <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>trousers.</b>|$|E
60|$|As Pep concluded, he {{suddenly}} dived {{into one of}} the pockets <b>of</b> <b>his</b> new <b>trousers,</b> and, after considerable difficulty, extricated a silver dollar.|$|R
60|$|He paused, {{and from}} the pocket <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shabby <b>trousers</b> he half drew out a long, {{sheathed}} hunting-knife, and then quickly hid it again from her sight.|$|R
50|$|Bicheno {{was a large}} man, and it {{was said}} that he could fit three full bags <b>of</b> wheat in <b>his</b> <b>trousers.</b>|$|R
60|$|As {{he lifted}} one foot and rubbed the hot sole against the leg <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>trousers,</b> the mate laughed in a savage, snarling fashion.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} Andrew Felps had {{rolled out of}} the blaze. His coat was on fire and so was one leg <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>trousers.</b>|$|E
60|$|He dropped {{gracefully}} into a chair, {{without waiting}} for permission, and, having hitched up the knees <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>trousers,</b> beamed winningly at the manager.|$|E
60|$|One windy November day I spied his {{somewhat}} ludicrous figure striding ahead <b>of</b> me, <b>his</b> <b>trousers</b> above <b>his</b> ankles. I was {{bundled up}} {{in a new}} ulster,--of which I was secretly quite proud,--but he wore no overcoat at all.|$|R
60|$|He good humoredly nodded, {{and took}} up his pen again,--a hint at which the embarrassed foreman, under cover <b>of</b> {{hitching}} up <b>his</b> <b>trousers,</b> awkwardly and reluctantly withdrew.|$|R
6000|$|... "I—was {{asked to}} call," [...] {{he said at}} last, and stooped and picked a piece <b>of</b> cotton from <b>his</b> <b>trousers.</b> [...] "I come from ’Maw and Meggins.’" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{would have}} {{pronounced}} him perfectly sober hadn't he paused in great concern {{to try and}} brush a hole off the knee <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>trousers.</b>|$|E
60|$|He felt heavy, full: then {{a gentle}} {{loosening}} of his bowels. He stood up, undoing the waistband <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>trousers.</b> The cat mewed to him.|$|E
6000|$|Milt was realizing--and hating {{himself for}} realizing--that Bill's face was dirty, his hair linty, the bottoms <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>trousers</b> frayed masses of mud, while Bill chuckled: ...|$|E
60|$|Archie {{felt that}} he should have guessed this. The chappie had a {{distinctly}} artistic look. He wore a bow-tie and all that sort <b>of</b> thing. <b>His</b> <b>trousers</b> bagged at the knees, and his hair, which during the martial epoch <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career had been pruned to the roots, fell about his ears in luxuriant disarray.|$|R
60|$|He {{squeezed}} {{the water out}} of the bottoms <b>of</b> <b>his</b> loose <b>trousers</b> and felt <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wooden leg and arms and head, and finding he had brought all <b>of</b> <b>his</b> person with him he gathered courage to examine closely their surroundings.|$|R
2500|$|Frederik Sødring wears a brocade {{waistcoat}} {{with a high}} {{black velvet}} shawl collar. [...] The front flap <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fall-front <b>trousers</b> can be seen clearly in this 1832 portrait. [...] Note the taper of the waistcoat toward the tight waist.|$|R
6000|$|He {{goes out}} through the outer office. JAMES paces the room. He [...] stops and looks at COKESON, who is disconsolately rubbing the [...] knees <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>trousers.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The Count {{answered}} {{this request}} by a polite [...] "Certainly," [...] and dropped his {{hands with the}} intention of exploring both pockets <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>trousers</b> for the matches.|$|E
6000|$|Psmith {{closed the}} window gently {{and turned to}} Jellicoe. [...] "Who was our guest?" [...] he asked, dusting the knees <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>trousers</b> where they had pressed against the wall.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that's pretty average cool," [...] said Abanazar {{behind a}} slab of cream and jam, as Beetle, {{reassured}} upon the safety <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Sunday <b>trousers,</b> showed not even surprise, much less resentment. Indeed, it was McTurk who grew angry, saying: ...|$|R
5000|$|Colin and Kenneth's {{lives are}} insular {{revolving}} around the local Indian Restaurant and their weekly [...] "film club" [...] night. Colin wears shorts and sandals all year round, Kenneth has a habit <b>of</b> losing <b>his</b> <b>trousers.</b> Colin's social awkwardness and gaucheness is {{tested by the}} attraction he feels towards his new boss and competition for her attention from the right-on drama teacher Danny Woods.|$|R
60|$|This had {{happened}} now when {{a fellow who}} sat in the corner by the window made some rough jest about the young Count. Leopold {{made his way to}} Klara's side; his thin lips were tightly pressed together, and he had buried his hands in the pockets <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ill-fitting <b>trousers.</b>|$|R
60|$|Stephen {{had already}} {{felt that there}} was some money in the pockets <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>trousers,</b> and he now handed his letter to the old woman and pulled out some gold.|$|E
60|$|At the housesteps of the 4th Of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number 7 Eccles street, he {{inserted}} {{his hand}} mechanically {{into the back}} pocket <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>trousers</b> to obtain his latchkey.|$|E
60|$|To {{show how}} lightly he could part with his wealth, {{he lifted his}} shirt out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>trousers,</b> unbosoming himself of his doubloons, which tumbled about his feet, a golden storm.|$|E
60|$|The key proffered {{him by the}} {{bereaved}} widower being a large one, he slips his two-foot rule into a side-pocket <b>of</b> <b>his</b> flannel <b>trousers</b> made for it, and deliberately opens his flannel coat, and opens {{the mouth of a}} large breast-pocket within it before taking the key to place it in that repository.|$|R
60|$|Ben was {{prepared}} for <b>his</b> portion <b>of</b> the work. <b>His</b> <b>trousers</b> were belted tightly around his waist by a very narrow leather belt, with an enormously large buckle, and his shirt-sleeves were rolled up as high as he could get them, {{in order to give}} full play to his arms.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{belongs to}} this village, anyway, doesn't she?" [...] he queried, {{still trying to}} speak calmly. He had risen {{to his feet and}} stood with squared shoulders, legs wide apart, and hands buried in the pockets <b>of</b> <b>his</b> tightly-fitting <b>trousers.</b> An ugly, ill-tempered, masterful man, who showed in every line <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{attitude}} that he meant to be supreme lord in his own household.|$|R
