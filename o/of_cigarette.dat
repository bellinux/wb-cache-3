5|$|Lung {{cancer was}} {{uncommon}} {{before the advent}} <b>of</b> <b>cigarette</b> smoking; it was not even recognized as a distinct disease until 1761. Different aspects of lung cancer were described further in 1810. Malignant lung tumors made up only 1% of all cancers seen at autopsy in 1878, but had risen to 10–15% by the early 1900s. Case reports in the medical literature numbered only 374 worldwide in 1912, but a review of autopsies showed the incidence of lung cancer had increased from 0.3% in 1852 to 5.66% in 1952. In Germany in 1929, physician Fritz Lickint recognized the link between smoking and lung cancer, which led to an aggressive antismoking campaign. The British Doctors' Study, published in the 1950s, was the first solid epidemiological evidence {{of the link between}} lung cancer and smoking. As a result, in 1964 the Surgeon General of the United States recommended smokers should stop smoking.|$|E

5000|$|For the OPMs (Original Participating Manufacturers), the {{payments}} are determined {{in accordance with}} their relative market share as of 1997. The payment amount of a particular OPM is also dictated by the [...] "Volume Adjustment," [...] which compares the number <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes</b> sold in each payment year to the number <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes</b> sold in 1997. If the number <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes</b> sold by an OPM in a given year is less than the number it sold in 1997, the Volume Adjustment allows that OPM to reduce its payment to the settling states. In other words, a reduction in the amount <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes</b> sold by the OPMs results in the settling states receiving less money.|$|R

5|$|After {{the events}} of the season six finale, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Michael Kritschgau (John Finn) are desperately {{attempting}} to find the truth behind the so-called alien object. Meanwhile, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is still imprisoned by his own frenetic brain activity. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Skinner are unaware of FBI Special Agent Diana Fowley's (Mimi Rogers) duplicity—she is working for Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis). Scully then travels to Africa to unravel the secrets of the alien artifacts, finding something that looks like a spaceship buried under the shoreline off the Côte d'Ivoire coast. The object may prove that life originated elsewhere, and all religion is based on the Navajo contact with alien life. Unsuccessful, Scully returns from Africa to revisit Mulder in Washington, D.C., but instead she finds out that he has disappeared. She contacts Kritschgau and Skinner to find her partner. Cigarette Smoking Man has taken Mulder to a place where all his problems seem to have disappeared. Fowley helps Scully locate Mulder, which leads to her death at the hands <b>of</b> <b>Cigarette</b> Smoking Man.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary risk}} factor for COPD {{globally}} is tobacco smoking. Of those who smoke about 20% will get COPD, and {{of those who are}} lifelong smokers about half will get COPD. In the United States and United Kingdom, of those with COPD, 80–95% are either current smokers or previously smoked. The likelihood of developing COPD increases with the total smoke exposure. Additionally, women are more susceptible to the harmful effects of smoke than men. In non-smokers, secondhand smoke is the cause of about 20% of cases. Other types of smoke, such as, marijuana, cigar, and water pipe smoke, also confer a risk. Water pipe smoke appears to be as harmful as smoking cigarettes. Problems from marijuana smoke may only be with heavy use. Women who smoke during pregnancy may increase the risk of COPD in their child. For the same amount <b>of</b> <b>cigarette</b> smoking, women have a higher risk of COPD than men.|$|E

40|$|Background: Recent federal {{legislation}} gives the U. S. Food and Drug Administration {{authority to regulate}} the nicotine content <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes.</b> A nationwide strategy for progressive reduction of the nicotine content <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes</b> is a potential {{way to reduce the}} addictiveness <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> to prevent new smokers from becoming addicted, and to facilitate quitting in established smokers. We conducted a trial of progressive nicotine content tapering over 6 months to determine the effects on smoking behaviors and biomarkers of tobacco smoke exposure and cardiovascular effects. Methods: One hundred and thirty-five healthy smokers were {{randomly assigned to one of}} two groups. A research group smoked their usual brand <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes</b> followed by five types <b>of</b> research <b>cigarettes</b> with progressively lower nicotine content, each smoked for one month. Acontrol group smoked their own brand <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes</b> for the same period of time. Results: Nicotine intake, as indicated by plasma cotinine concentration, declined progressively as the nicotine content <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes</b> was reduced. Cigarette consumption and markers of exposure to carbon monoxide and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, as well as cardiovascular biomarkers remained stable, whereas urinary 4 -(methylnitrosamino) - 1 -(3 -pyridyl) - 1 -butanol (NNAL) excretion decreased. No significant changes in biomarkers of exposure or cardiovascular effects were observed in controls. Conclusions: Our data support the proposition that the intake <b>of</b> nicotine from <b>cigarettes</b> <b>of</b> smokers can be substantially lowered without increasing exposure to other tobacco smoke toxins. Impact: These findings support the feasibility and safety of gradual reduction of the nicotine content in cigarettes. © 2012 AACR...|$|R

50|$|In contrast, Faizul Latif Chowdhury, in 1999, {{suggested}} a production-substituting model of smuggling in which price disparity due to cost of supply {{is critically important}} as an incentive for smuggling.

Drawing attention to the case <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> Chowdhury suggested that, in Bangladesh, smuggling <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes</b> reduced the level of domestic production.
