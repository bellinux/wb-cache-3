5|$|Hygeberht's {{contemporary}} at Canterbury, Æthelhard, was {{the first}} Archbishop of Canterbury to require an affirmation of faith from his subordinate bishops when they were elected.

5|$|Money {{that had}} been raised during the 1920s and {{financial}} backing from the Rockefeller Foundation helped the school to survive through the Great Depression.

5|$|PA 563 {{was first}} created in 1928 to connect Bergey to Harrow, {{following}} its current alignment to PA313 before continuing straight along Ridge Road {{and continuing to}} PA412. By 1940, construction of the road into a state highway was completed. In the early 1970s, PA563 was moved to its current alignment north of PA313 as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> Lake Nockamixon, which severed the original alignment.|$|E

5|$|A {{constitutional}} {{convention was}} convened in Salt Lake City on March 8, 1849, {{to work on}} a proposal for federal recognition of a state or territory. The convention resulted in the provisional State of Deseret. Deseret claimed most of present-day Utah, Nevada and Arizona, with parts of California, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Oregon, and Wyoming. Brigham Young was elected governor on March 12, 1849, and the legislature first met on July 2, 1849. The state, having never been recognized by the federal government, was formally dissolved on April 5, 1851, several months after word <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> Utah Territory reached Salt Lake City.|$|E

5|$|As {{a member}} of the old Conservative {{government}} Cave left office on 23 January 1924. He was replaced by Lord Haldane, who was serving for a second time and was sworn in on 25 January. Haldane was in favour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> a Ministry of Justice, and although Schuster was privately against it he suggested that he would have accepted the responsibilities of such a Ministry on the condition that it remained under his control as the Lord Chancellor's Office was. Haldane was ill, however, and the Labour government lasted only ten months thanks to the publishing of the Zinoviev Letter, and no large-scale reforms such as the creation of a Ministry of Justice were ever pushed through.|$|E

The section between Cedar and Larch streets was retained {{as part of}} the new Capitol Loop and the remainder inside the city of Lansing was removed from the state trunkline highway system on October 13, 1989. At the time, M-143 in the City of East Lansing was not transferred, and MDOT removed the signage, creating an unsigned trunkline.|$|E
5|$|Heat {{generated}} from the Farallon Plate subducting below the North American Plate {{led to the creation}} of an island arc of volcanoes on the west coast of proto-North America between the late Devonian and Permian periods.

5|$|In 1975, NC98 was rerouted in Durham: {{replacing}} the old alignment to US15 Bus./US501 Bus. via Miami Boulevard and Geer Street, to Holloway Street (westbound)/Chapel Hill Street-Liberty Street (eastbound) and its current western terminus. In 1978, NC98 replaced part of US64's routing {{to its current}} eastern terminus. In 1981, part of NC98 was abandoned and placed on new construction as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> Falls Lake; remnants of the old alignment that were not submerged became secondary roads. In 2006, NC98 was rerouted south along US1 and onto a new four-lane bypass south of Wake Forest to Jones Dairy Road; its old alignment becoming NC98 Business. In 2011, NC98 was removed from US1 and placed onto new construction east of Falls of Neuse Road; NC98 Business was also realigned, starting further east along a new alignment of Durham Road.|$|E
5|$|In 1984 Cadw {{was formed}} as the {{historic}} environment {{service of the}} Welsh Government and took over {{the management of the}} four sites, operating them as tourist attractions. In 2007, over 530,000 visits were made to the sites. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the castles and town walls played a more prominent part in debates surrounding Welsh identity. The use of Caernarfon in the investiture of the Prince of Wales in 1911 and 1969, for example, was challenged by Welsh nationalists such as Alun Ffred Jones. Cadw expanded the interpretation provided at the sites to give more emphasis to the impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> the castles on the native Welsh, {{and the role of the}} Welsh princes in the events leading up to the 1282 invasion itself.|$|E

The session was attended by Lennon, McCartney and producer George Martin. Unlike most LPs, there was no customary three-second gap between tracks, and the master was edited so that songs segued together, via a straight edit, a crossfade, or an incidental piece of music.|$|E

5|$|The {{probability}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> strangelets decreases {{at higher}} energies. As the LHC operates at higher energies than the RHIC or the heavy ion {{programs of the}} 1980s and 1990s, the LHC {{is less likely to}} produce strangelets than its predecessors. Furthermore, models indicate that strangelets are only stable or long-lived at low temperatures. Strangelets are bound at low energies (in the range of 1–10MeV), while the collisions in the LHC release energies in the range of 7–14TeV. Thermodynamics very strongly disfavors the formation of a cold condensate that is an order of magnitude cooler than the surrounding medium. As an example, it is about as likely as producing an icecube in a furnace.|$|E
5|$|As {{with any}} non-repeating calendar, the Maya {{measured}} time from a fixed start point. The Maya set {{the beginning of}} their calendar as the end of a previous cycle of bak'tuns, equivalent to a day in 3114 BC. This was believed by the Maya to be the day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> the world in its current form. The Maya used the Long Count Calendar to fix any given day of the Calendar Round within their current great Piktun cycle consisting of either 20 bak'tuns. There was some variation in the calendar, specifically texts in Palenque demonstrate that the piktun cycle that ended in 3114 BC had only 13 bak'tuns, and other inscriptions seem to have used an exceptional cycle of 13 + 20 bak'tun in the current piktun. Additionally, there may have been some regional variation in how these exceptional cycles were managed.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{construction}} delays at Estadio Centenario, Uruguay's first match was not played until five {{days into the}} tournament. The first {{to be held at}} the Centenario, it was preceded by a ceremony in honour of the Uruguayan centenary celebrations. The Uruguayan team spent the four weeks preceding the match in a training camp, at which strict discipline was exercised. Goalkeeper Andrés Mazali was dropped from the squad for breaking a curfew to visit his wife. One hundred years to the day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> Uruguay's first constitution, the hosts won a tight match against Peru 1–0. Spectators praised Peru's defense, and {{this turned out to be}} the only tournament match in which Uruguay scored only one goal. The result was viewed as a poor performance by the Uruguayan press, but lauded in Peru. Uruguay subsequently defeated Romania with ease, scoring four first half goals to win 4–0.|$|E
