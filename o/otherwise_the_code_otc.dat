40|$|Abstract. An {{additional}} complexity {{inherent to}} any model-driven engineering proposal {{is the task}} of modeling the primitive types supported by each technological platform. If we want the models {{to be used as}} the input to generate directly <b>the</b> <b>code</b> that implements <b>the</b> system, the model has to be both complete and detailed. <b>Otherwise,</b> <b>the</b> <b>code</b> generation process results in mere skeletons of the working-code, requiring from a lot of handprogramming to have a fully operable system. This work sketches a simple, yet efficient technique for modeling of primitive types in platform specific models and shows its application for the modeling of Object-Relational databases. As well, we explore the implications of modeling primitive types in the development of model transformations. To that end, we specify a generic way of addressing this issue and show its application using again the Object-Relational databases modeling scenario...|$|R

The analysis of the resultant database will {{shed some light on}} these monoids combinatorial or <b>otherwise.</b> <b>The</b> <b>code</b> for this thesis allows us to generate syntactic monoids from a regular state graph with 2 to 5 states.

Two earlier computer science theses attempted to categorize finite groups of 64 elements or less as a web tool. Other thesis explored counter free automata, which can be algebraically described in terms of properties of syntactic monoids. The group theory approach is to try to characterize small order groups in terms of their algebraic properties, each as the orders of the group elements. The motivation for this thesis is not just pure algebra of finite monoids, but rather the relevance of finite monoids to counter free automata, in particular to syntactic monoid with trivial and non trivial subgroups...|$|R
5000|$|More subtly, {{successful}} resource acquisition must dominate resource release, as <b>otherwise</b> <b>the</b> <b>code</b> {{will try}} to release a resource it has not acquired. The consequences of such an incorrect release range from being silently ignored to crashing the program or unpredictable behavior. These bugs generally manifest rarely, as they require resource allocation to first fail, which is generally an exceptional case. Further, the consequences may not be serious, as the program may already be crashing due to failure to acquire an essential resource. However, these can prevent recovery from the failure, or turn an orderly shutdown into a disorderly shutdown. This condition is generally ensured by first checking that the resource was successfully acquired before releasing it, either by having a boolean variable to record [...] "successfully acquired" [...] - which lacks atomicity if the resource is acquired but the flag variable fails to be updated, or conversely - or by the handle to the resource being a nullable type, where [...] "null" [...] indicates [...] "not successfully acquired", which ensures atomicity.|$|R

40|$|It is {{commonly}} believed {{that access to}} the instance variables of an object by its synchronisation code is {{needed in order to}} implement many synchronisation policies.

40|$|This work {{considers}} the multiple-access multicast error-correction scenario over a packetized network with z malicious edge adversaries. The network has min-cut m and packets of length `, and each sink demands all {{information from the}} set of sources S. In this paper we look at both the “side-channel ” model (where sources and sinks share some random bits that are secret from the adversary) and the “omniscient ” adversarial model (where we do not assume limitations on the adversary’s knowledge). For both adversarial models, we provide outer bounds on the achievable rate-region for communication, and give corresponding communication schemes that operate at rates matching any point satisfying the outer bounds. In the “side-channel ” adversarial model, {{the use of a}} secret channel allows higher rates to be achieved compared to the “omniscient ” adversarial model, and a polynomial-time <b>code</b> to achieve <b>the</b> optimal rates is provided. For the “omniscient ” adversarial model, we develop two capacity-achieving communication schemes: the first approach is based on random subspace code design of complexity that grows exponentially in `m, whereas, the second approach uses a novel multiple-field-extension technique to provide an algorithm that is polynomial-time in the network size, having an O(`m|S|) complexity. Our codes are “end-to-end”, that is, all nodes except the sources and the sinks are oblivious to the adversaries present in the network and may simply implement predesigned linear network <b>codes</b> (random or <b>otherwise).</b> <b>The</b> <b>codes</b> are also distributed in tha...|$|R

40|$|In {{previous}} works, we defined <b>the</b> Optimal Transform <b>Code</b> (<b>OTC)</b> assuming {{high rate}} <b>coding</b> and using <b>the</b> asymptotical Bennett approximation of the rate. We {{showed that the}} OTC gives the optimal linear transform of a multicomponent image compression scheme which consists in applying a linear transform that adapts to the encoded image for reducing the spectral redundancy and a fixed 2 -D Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) per component for reducing the spatial redundancy. The performances in terms of rate vs PSNR (Peak of Signal to Noise Ratio) are very attractive when evaluated with the Verification Model version 9 of the JPEG 2000 committee which is a JPEG 2000 codec (coding-decoding). The transform in OTC performs better than the Karhunen Loeve Transform (KLT). The drawback of the OTC is its high computing complexity, since the optimal linear transform must be computed for each encoded image. In order to implement the OTC in an on- board satellite real-time codec system, we propose to pass round the problem of computing complexity by learning only one fixed transform with the OTC algorithms from a set of images instead of computing a new transform for each image. We call the fixed transform computed in this way an exogenous quasi-optimal linear transform. In this paper, we focus the study on hyperspectral images. Our set of images is constituted of ten Hyperion 3 hyperspectral images. We have separated the VNIR and the SWIR bands (since they are obtained with two different sensors on- board) and we just focus on the VNIR spectral bands...|$|R

Unlike other communication system, real-time transmission requires high data rate and good error performance to ensure good quality of service. This study describes the design problem of real-time wireless {{data transmission}} which provides higher achievable data rate with Unequal Error Protection (UEP). Approach: Real-time data stream was divided equally into two streams, High Priority (HP) and Low Priority (LP) streams depending on their requirements. We considered these two bit streams as being encoded separately by two adaptive encoders. Feedback of Channel State Information (CSI) was used in adaptive physical layer channel for efficient use of the current available bandwidth by controlling <b>the</b> encoders. High <b>code</b> rate were used in both encoders when the channel is good while low <b>code</b> rate is <b>otherwise.</b> <b>The</b> two <b>coded</b> data streams were superimposed together with two different adjustable levels of power to achieve the UEP at the receiver end. Results: In this proposed scheme, same design metrics, namely, time, bandwidth and power were used to increase the transmission efficiency.
