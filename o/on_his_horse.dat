Heavily wounded, Glass retreats into the mountains where he is visited by the spirit of his wife.|$|E

5|$|Bona Allen saddles were {{available}} through the Sears mail order catalog, and many Hollywood actors used saddles made by the Bona Allen Company, including cowboy actors Gene Autry, the cast of Bonanza, and Roy Rogers, who used a Bona Allen saddle <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>horse</b> Trigger. A statue of Roy Rogers and a Bona Allen saddle-maker saddling Trigger is located in downtown Buford. The Bona Allen Company thrived during the Great Depression in the 1930s, likely {{as a result of}} the Depression forcing farmers to choose horses over expensive tractors, thereby increasing the demand for saddles, collars, bridles, and other leather products.|$|E
5|$|In {{his brief}} retirement, he focused <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>horse</b> racing career, sending Talk is Money to the 2001 Kentucky Derby {{although}} the thoroughbred {{did not complete}} the race.

After selling most of his horses in 2004, Borislow set forth {{plans for a new}} voice-over-IP business which became the magicJack.

Vermillion tried to retrieve his rifle wedged in the scabbard under his fallen horse, exposing himself to the Cowboys' gunfire. Doc Holliday helped him get to cover.

5|$|Despite its failure, Maslama's {{attempt to}} capture Constantinople became celebrated in later Muslim literature, with several {{surviving}} accounts, mostly semi-fictional, {{in which the}} historical defeat {{was transformed into a}} sort of victory: Maslama was said to have departed only after symbolically entering the Byzantine capital <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>horse</b> accompanied by thirty riders; Leo received him with honour and led him to the Hagia Sophia, where the emperor paid homage to the Arab general. The tales of the siege influenced similar episodes in Arabic epic literature, where Maslama appears associated with another legendary Arab hero of the wars against Byzantium, Abdallah al-Battal. Furthermore, Byzantine tradition, as recorded in the 10th-century De Administrando Imperio, held that during the siege Maslama convinced the Byzantines to build Constantinople's first mosque, near the city's praetorium. Later Ottoman tradition also ascribed the building of the Arap Mosque (located outside Constantinople proper in Galata) to Maslama, although it erroneously dated this to around 686, probably confusing Maslama's attack with the first Arab siege in the 670s. In reality, the mosque near the praetorium was most likely erected in about 860, {{as a result of an}} Arab embassy in that year.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was caught}} by {{surprise}} at Le Mans but made a forced march north to Alençon, from where he could escape into the safety of Normandy. Suddenly, however, Henry turned back south towards Anjou, {{against the advice of}} his officials. The weather was extremely hot, the King was increasingly ill and he appears to have wanted to die peacefully in Anjou rather than fight yet another campaign. Henry evaded the enemy forces on his way south and collapsed in his castle at Chinon. Philip and Richard were making good progress, not least because it was now obvious that Henry was dying and that Richard would be the next king, and the pair offered negotiations. They met at Ballan, where Henry, only just able to remain seated <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>horse,</b> agreed to a complete surrender: he would do homage to Philip; he would give up Alice to a guardian and she would marry Richard {{at the end of the}} coming crusade; he would recognise Richard as his heir; he would pay Philip compensation, and key castles would be given to Philip as a guarantee.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Spartan counter-attack against the Epiriotes filling the trench, Pyrrhus decided to personally lead a charge against the Spartan lines. Mounted <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>horse,</b> the Epiriote King was able to force his away through the trench, over the wagons and into the city {{with a group of}} his companions. The sudden onslaught of Pyrrhus sparked panic amongst the defenders of this section. At this point Pyrrhus' horse was wounded by a javelin which pierced its belly causing it to throw the King to the ground. The fall of the King threw his companions into a state of confusion and enabled the Spartans to rally. The Spartans launched a barrage of missiles at the King's comrades, felling many of them. Despite the deaths of many of his guards, Pyrrhus was successfully taken to the safety of the main Epiriote lines.|$|E

5|$|Several years later, Radha's two {{surviving}} children, Birju (Sunil Dutt) and Ramu (Rajendra Kumar), {{are young}} men. Birju, embittered since childhood by {{the demands of}} Sukhilala, takes out his frustrations by pestering the village girls, especially Sukhilala's daughter, Rupa. Ramu, by contrast, has a calmer temperament and is married soon after. Birju's anger finally becomes dangerous and, after being provoked, he attacks Sukhilala and his daughter and steals Radha's kangan (marriage bracelets) that were pawned with Sukhilala. He is chased out of the village and becomes a bandit. Radha promises Sukhilala that she will not let Birju cause harm to Sukhilala's family. On Rupa's wedding day, Birju returns with his gang of bandits to exact his revenge. He kills Sukhilala and kidnaps Rupa. When he tries to flee the village <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>horse,</b> Radha, his mother, shoots him. He dies in her arms. The film returns to 1957; Radha opens {{the gate of the}} canal and its reddish water flows into the fields.|$|E
5|$|Sheridan Road {{was created}} in the early 20th century {{connecting}} Chicago with Fort Sheridan north of the city. Both the road and the fort were named in honor of Philip Sheridan, Union general during the Civil War. Sheridan, who served as colonel of the 2nd Michigan Cavalry in 1862, was later promoted to the rank of major general during the war. The Greater Sheridan Road Association started to promote an extension of the road south to St. Louis and north through Wisconsin and Michigan to end at Fort Wilkins in Copper Harbor by 1922. The roadway followed US41's predecessor, M-15, and included numerous road signs bearing Sheridan's silhouette mounted <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>horse</b> Rienzi. Towns along the way were encouraged to rename city streets as Sheridan Road on Labor Day 1923. The road was promoted until the Great Depression in the 1930s. All that remains are signs in Menominee noting that First Street was once Sheridan Road.|$|E
5|$|Ina Coolbrith {{was born}} Josephine Donna Smith in Nauvoo, Illinois, {{the last of}} three daughters of Agnes Moulton Coolbrith and Don Carlos Smith, brother to Joseph Smith Coolbrith's father died of malarial fever four months after her birth, and a sister died one month after that; Coolbrith's mother then married Joseph Smith, in 1842, {{becoming}} his sixth or seventh wife. No children came of the union—Agnes felt neglected in her unfruitful Levirate marriage, the only such marriage of Smith. In June 1844, Smith was killed {{at the hands of}} an anti-Mormon mob. Losing her faith and fearful of her life, Coolbrith's mother left the Latter-day Saint community and moved to Saint Louis, Missouri, where she married a printer and lawyer named William Pickett. Twin sons were born to the couple, and in 1851 Pickett traveled overland with his new family to California in a wagon train. On the long trek, the young Ina read from a book of Shakespeare's works and from a collection of Byron's poems. As a ten-year-old girl, Ina entered California in front of the wagon train with the famous African-American scout Jim Beckwourth, riding with him <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>horse,</b> through what would later be named Beckwourth Pass. The family settled in Los Angeles, California, and Pickett established a law practice.|$|E
