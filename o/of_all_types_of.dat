5|$|Lithium amides {{like the}} diisopropylamide (LDA) and the (tetramethylpiperidide (LiTMP)) {{generally}} {{work well for}} the deprotonation <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> salts, providing that not too much LiOH {{is present in the}} n-butyllithium used to make the lithium amide. Titration of lithium amide can be used to determine the amount of hydroxide in solution. The deprotonation of precursor salts with metal hexamethyldisilazides works very cleanly for the deprotonation <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> salts, except for unhindered formamidinium salts, where this base can act as a nucleophile to give a triaminomethane adduct.|$|E
5|$|The Hurricane Severity Index (HSI) {{is another}} scale used and rates the {{severity}} <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> tropical and subtropical cyclones based {{on both the}} intensity {{and the size of}} their wind fields. The HSI is a 0 to 50 point scale, allotting up to 25 points for a tropical cyclone's intensity and up to 25 points for wind field size. Points are awarded on a sliding scale, with the majority of points reserved for hurricane force and greater wind fields.|$|E
5|$|Very {{massive stars}} can undergo core {{collapse}} when nuclear fusion becomes unable {{to sustain the}} core against its own gravity; passing this threshold is the cause <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> supernova except Type Ia. The collapse may cause violent expulsion of the outer layers of the star resulting in a supernova, or the release of gravitational potential energy may be insufficient and the star may collapse into a black hole or neutron star with little radiated energy.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with other}} members of the lipocalin protein family, major urinary {{proteins}} can be potent allergens to humans. The reason for this is not known, however molecular mimicry between Mups and structurally similar human lipocalins has been proposed as a possible explanation. The protein product of the mouse Mup17 gene, known as Musm1, Ag1 or MA1, accounts for much of the allergenic properties of mouse urine. The protein is extremely stable in the environment; studies have found 95% of inner city homes, and 82% <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> homes in the United States have detectable levels in at least one room. Similarly, Ratn1 is a known human allergen. A US study found its presence in 33% of inner city homes, and 21% of occupants were sensitized to the allergen. Exposure and sensitization to rodent Mup proteins is considered a risk factor for childhood asthma, and is a leading cause of laboratory animal allergy (LAA)—an occupational disease of laboratory animal technicians and scientists. One study found that two-thirds of laboratory workers who had developed asthmatic reactions to animals had antibodies to Ratn1.|$|E
5|$|The {{proportions}} <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> {{matter and}} energy have changed over {{the history of the}} Universe. Today, ordinary matter, which includes atoms, stars, galaxies, and life, accounts for only 4.9% of the contents of the Universe. The present overall density of this type of matter is very low, roughly 4.5 × 10−31 grams per cubic centimetre, corresponding to a density of the order of only one proton for every four cubic meters of volume. The nature of both dark energy and dark matter is unknown. Dark matter, a mysterious form of matter that has not yet been identified, accounts for 26.8% of the contents. Dark energy, which is the energy of empty space and is causing the expansion of the Universe to accelerate, accounts for the remaining 68.3% of the contents.|$|E
