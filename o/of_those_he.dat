5|$|Jervis {{was also}} {{recognised}} by {{both political and}} military contemporaries as a fine administrator and naval reformer. As Commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean, between 1795 and 1799 he introduced a series of severe standing orders to avert mutiny. He applied those orders to both seamen and officers alike, a policy {{that made him a}} controversial figure. He took his disciplinarian system of command with him when he took command of the Channel Fleet in 1799. In 1801, as First Lord of the Admiralty he introduced a number of reforms that, though unpopular at the time, made the Navy more efficient and more self-sufficient. He introduced innovations including block making machinery at Portsmouth Royal Dockyard. St Vincent was known for his generosity to officers he considered worthy of reward and his swift and often harsh punishment <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>he</b> felt deserved it.|$|E
5|$|Marriages among ruling dynasties {{and their}} {{subjects}} have at times been common, with the marriages {{such as that}} of Edward the Confessor, King of England with Edith of Wessex and Władysław II Jagiełło, King of Poland with Elizabeth Granowska being far from unheard of in medieval Europe. However, as dynasties approached absolutism and sought to preserve loyalty among competing members of the nobility, most eventually distanced themselves from kinship ties to local nobles by marrying abroad. Marriages with subjects brought the king back down to the level <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>he</b> ruled, often stimulating the ambition of his consort's family and evoking jealousy—or disdain—from the nobility. The notion that monarchs should marry into the dynasties of other monarchs to end or prevent war was, at first, a policy driven by pragmatism. During the era of absolutism, this practice contributed to the notion that it was socially, as well as politically, disadvantageous for members of ruling families to intermarry with their subjects and pass over the opportunity for marriage into a foreign dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Temeraire now resumed her {{previous}} duties blockading the French at Brest. Heavy weather took its toll, {{forcing her to}} put into Torbay for extensive repairs after her long patrols, repairs which eventually amounted to £9,143. During this time Harvey was often absent from his command, usually attending to his duties as Member of Parliament for Essex. He was temporarily replaced by Captain William Kelly on 27 August 1804, and he in turn was succeeded by Captain George Fawke on 6 April 1805. Harvey returned to his ship on 9 July 1805, and it was {{while he was in}} command that the reinforced Rochefort squadron under Vice-Admiral Sir Robert Calder intercepted and attacked a Franco-Spanish fleet at the Battle of Cape Finisterre. The French commander, Pierre-Charles Villeneuve, was thwarted in his attempt to join the French forces at Brest, and instead sailed south to Ferrol, and then to Cadiz. When news of the Franco-Spanish fleet's location reached the Admiralty, they appointed Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson to take command of the blockading force at Cadiz, which at the time was being commanded by Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood. Nelson was told to pick whichever ships he liked to serve under him, and one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>he</b> specifically chose was Temeraire.|$|E

25|$|A {{production}} crew conducting research for Maxwell, an eponymous biographical film by the BBC, uncovered tapes {{stored in a}} suitcase owned by Maxwell's former head of security John Pole.

25|$|Lastly, {{he ruled}} that the other {{respondents}} beside Quon had not suffered a violation of their privacy.

Since the Court had found that Quon's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated, it therefore had to hold that the others' were not, either.|$|E
25|$|The Swami {{received}} an anonymous threat {{only a week}} before his assassination. Ashram authorities also filed a First Information Report (or FIR) with the local police. However, no steps were taken to provide appropriate security cover to Swamiji, despite ample evidence that there were very real threats being made on his life and the lives <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>he</b> served. The Government of Odisha would later admit that lapses might have occurred in his security and would place Kandhamal Superintendent of Police Nikhil Kanodia and officer-in-charge of Tumudibandha police station Jena under suspension.|$|E

25|$|Of 35 tournaments {{he fought}} in during his career—there {{were only two}} basho {{a year at the}} time—Raiden had the best record in no fewer than 28.

In seven <b>of</b> <b>those,</b> <b>he</b> won without suffering a single defeat or draw. In total, he achieved 254 victories and only ten defeats, a winning percentage of 96.2, an all-time record. His longest winning streaks were eleven consecutive tournaments or 44 bouts.|$|E

Angel tells En he sees only goodness inside him, which makes Evan happy, so he thanks Angel for being a good friend. In fact, Angel lied, as the only thing he could see was the dark image of Apocalypse.|$|E

25|$|On 13 July 1683, {{at the age}} of sixteen, the new Earl of Salisbury married Frances Bennett (1670–1713), a {{daughter}} of Simon Bennett, of Buckinghamshire.

Frances Bennett married Salisbury before she was sixteen, but with the consent of the Executors to the will, and this later led to litigation.|$|E
25|$|Bishop {{was active}} {{with a large}} number of organisations, and for many <b>of</b> <b>those,</b> <b>he</b> acted as chairman, secretary, or treasurer.

He was chairman of the Rifle Association. He was treasurer for the Canterbury volunteers (a private army) and donated a cup for annual competition amongst the volunteers when he was chairman of the city council. In 1868, Bishop was on the committee that lobbied for a road through Hagley Park connecting Armagh Street and Riccarton Road. He was elected Chief Fire Inspector of the Christchurch Fire Police.|$|E
