40|$|Abstract—Modularity is {{important}} in the collaborative development of large scale ontologies. The subject has al-ready been studied deeply and different notions of modu-larity have been introduced. Further different algorithms for <b>extracting</b> <b>module</b> are developed. Such an extraction requires an input ontology and a signature. The <b>extracted</b> <b>module</b> is a subset of the original ontology containing no concept name and role names other than those occurring in the input signature. In this paper we focus on a very special case of importing a single concept i. e., our input signature contains only a single concept name. We will see that we always end up with the same set of modules (modulo the concept name being imported). An <b>extracted</b> <b>module</b> for a single concept name (using the current techniques), may contain a lot more other concept names and role names, we prove that when we are only interested in the consequences of the <b>extracted</b> <b>module,</b> we don’t get more information ex-cept of what we get from the set of modules we present here...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{premises}} of the OBO Foundry is that development of an orthogonal set of ontologies will increase domain expert contributions and logical interoperability, and decrease maintenance workload. For these reasons, the Cell Ontology (CL) is being re-engineered. This process requires the extraction of sub-modules from existing OBO ontologies, which presents a number of practical engineering challenges. These <b>extracted</b> <b>modules</b> may be intended to cover a narrow or a broad set of species. In addition, applications and resources that {{make use of the}} Cell Ontology have particular modularization requirements, such as the ability to extract custom subsets or unions of the Cell Ontology with other OBO ontologies. These <b>extracted</b> <b>modules</b> may be intended to cover a narrow or a broad set of species, which presents unique complications. |$|R

In this paper, {{we present a}} method for generating biologically plausible in silico networks, which allow realistic performance assessment of network inference algorithms. Instead of using random graph models, which are known to only partly capture the structural properties of biological networks, we generate network structures by <b>extracting</b> <b>modules</b> from known biological interaction networks. Using the yeast transcriptional regulatory network as a test case, we show that <b>extracted</b> <b>modules</b> have a biologically plausible connectivity because they preserve functional and structural properties of the original network.

40|$|Abstract We {{present the}} first large scale {{investigation}} into the modular structure of a substantial collection of state-of-the-art biomedical ontologies, namely those maintained in the NCBO BioPortal repository. 5 Using the notion of Atomic Decomposition, we partition BioPortal ontologies into logically coherent subsets (atoms), which are {{related to each other}} by a notion of dependency. We analyze various aspects of the resulting structures, and discuss their implications on applications of ontologies. In particular, we describe and investigate the usage of these ontology decompositions to <b>extract</b> <b>modules,</b> for instance, to facilitate matchmaking of semantic Web services in SSWAP (Simple Semantic Web Architecture and Protocol). Descriptions of those services use terms from BioPortal so service discovery requires reasoning with respect to relevant fragments of ontologies (i. e., modules). We present a novel algorithm for <b>extracting</b> <b>modules</b> from decomposed BioPortal ontologies which is able to quickly identify atoms that need to be included in a module to ensure logically complete reasoning. Compared to existing module extraction algorithms, it has a number of benefits, including improved performance and the possibility to avoid loading the entire ontology into memory. The algorithm is also evaluated on BioPortal ontologies and the results are presented and discussed...|$|R

This research hypothesizes that graph-based clustering can be used effectively for automated software architecture extraction. We propose methods of representing relationships between program artifacts as graphs and then propose new partitional algorithms to <b>extract</b> software <b>modules</b> from those graphs. To validate our hypothesis and the partitional algorithms a new set of tools, including a software data miner, cluster builder, graph viewer, and cluster score calculator, were created.

In this work, we propose computational methods for analyzing this neural code. Specifically, we show how non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), a machine-learning method for extracting the intrinsic parts of objects, can be used to automatically <b>extract</b> glomerular <b>modules</b> from a database of bulbar activity patterns, as measured with 2 -deoxyglucose. The <b>modules</b> <b>extracted</b> by NMF correspond to localized areas in olfactory bulb, in consistency with experimental results from imaging studies on glomerular activity. To validate the emerging representation, we analyzed the relationship between neural activity on these modules and perceptual descriptions of the odorants. We first used pattern-classification techniques to predict ten perceptual descriptors for 53 odorants from their activity on the modules. Our results indicate that NMF is able to <b>extract</b> <b>modules</b> that are intrinsic to the odor coding mechanism.

A greedy technique is also proposed to <b>extract</b> <b>modules</b> from unweighted network. The technique picks a pair of genes with next highest NCNMRS score at a time such that none of the genes in the pair has been included in any network <b>module</b> <b>extracted</b> so far and extends this partial module to a complete network module including genes with high connectivity into the partial module.

40|$|Abstract. Module {{extraction}} {{methods have}} proved to be effective in improving the performance of some ontology reasoning tasks, including finding justifica-tions to explain why an entailment holds in an OWL DL ontology. However, the existing module extraction methods that compute a syntactic locality-based module for the sub-concept in a subsumption entailment, though ensuring the resulting module to preserve all justifications of the entailment, may be insuffi-cient in improving the performance of finding all justifications. This is because a syntactic locality-based module is independent of the super-concept in a sub-sumption entailment and always contains all concept/role assertions. In order to <b>extract</b> smaller <b>modules</b> to further optimize finding all justifications in an OWL DL ontology, we propose a goal-directed method for <b>extracting</b> a <b>module</b> that preserves all justifications of a given entailment. Experimental results on large ontologies show that a <b>module</b> <b>extracted</b> by our method is smaller than the cor-responding syntactic locality-based module, making the subsequent computation of all justifications more scalable and more efficient. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Modularization is an {{important}} part of the modular design and maintenance of large scale ontologies. Syntactic locality modules, with their desirable model theoretic properties, play an ever increasing role in the design of algorithms for modularization, partitioning and reasoning tasks such as classification. It has been shown that, for the DL EL +, the syntactic locality module extraction problem is equivalent to the reachability problem for hypergraphs. In this paper we investigate and introduce a normal form for the DL SROIQ which allows us to map any SROIQ ontology to an equivalent hypergraph. We then show that standard hyperpath search algorithms can be used to <b>extract</b> <b>modules</b> similar to syntactic locality modules for SROIQ ontologies. ...|$|R

Integrative network analysis makes use of statistical and combinatorial methods to <b>extract</b> smaller subnetwork <b>modules,</b> and performs enrichment analysis to annotate the modules with ontology terms or other available knowledge. This process results in an annotated module, which retains the original network structure and includes enrichment information as a set system. A major bottleneck {{is a lack of}} tools that allow exploring both network structure of <b>extracted</b> <b>modules</b> and its annotations. Results: This paper presents a visual analysis approach that targets small modules with many set-based annotations, and which displays the annotations as contours on top of a node-link diagram. We introduce an extension of self-organizing maps to lay out nodes, links, and contours in a unified way. An implementation of this approach is freely available as the Cytoscape app eXamine. Conclusions: eXamine accurately conveys small and annotated modules consisting of several dozens of proteins and annotations.

40|$|International audienceModularity in {{the central}} nervous system (CNS), i. e., the brain {{capability}} to generate a wide repertoire of movements by combining a small number of building blocks ("modules"), is thought to underlie the control of movement. Numerous studies reported evidence for such a modular organization by identifying invariant muscle activation patterns across various tasks. However, previous studies relied on decompositions differing in both the nature and dimensionality of the identified modules. Here, we derive a single framework that encompasses all influential models of muscle activation modularity. We introduce a new model (named space-by-time decomposition) that factorizes muscle activations into concurrent spatial and temporal modules. To infer these modules, we develop an algorithm, referred to as sample-based nonnegative matrix trifactorization (sNM 3 F). We test the space-by-time decomposition on a comprehensive electromyographic dataset recorded during execution of arm pointing movements and show that it provides a low-dimensional yet accurate, highly flexible and task-relevant representation of muscle patterns. The <b>extracted</b> <b>modules</b> have a wellcharacterized functional meaning and implement an efficient trade-off between replication of the original muscle patterns and task discriminability. Furthermore, they are compatible with the <b>modules</b> <b>extracted</b> from existing models, such as synchronous synergies and temporal primitives, and generalize time-varying synergies.
