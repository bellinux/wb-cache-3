5|$|M. nigrocincta is a gamergate species, {{which allows}} female workers to be fertile, {{and these are}} then able to {{reproduce}} in both queenless and queenright (colonies with a queen) colonies. This means a colony which loses its queen can still thrive {{in the absence of}} the queen. In laboratory colonies of M. nigrocincta where there was no queen present, worker-laid eggs were reared to mature males, showing that workers are highly fertile. The average life expectancy of an adult worker M. nigrocincta ant is 1.1 to 1.2 years, with a maximum expectancy of 1.3 years (400 <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>days).</b> Larvae collected from M. nigrocincta are 4.7mm in length but increase to 9.7mm when matured.|$|E
5|$|The assault {{position}} was directly {{south of the}} inter-army boundary between the British Fifth and Second Armies. As a result, the Canadian Corps was to attack with support of formations from the British Fifth Army {{to the north and}} the I Anzac Corps and X Corps to the south. The offensive was executed in a series of attacks each with limited objectives, delivered at intervals of three <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>days.</b> The execution dates of the phases were tentatively given as 26 October, 30 October and 6 November with a final smaller action on 10 November. To permit time to facilitate inter-divisional relief, there was a planned seven-day pause between the second and third stages, during which the Second Army took over the XVIII Corps area of the Fifth Army, north of the Canadian Corps with the II Corps on 2 November, to assure unity of command over {{the central part of the}} attack front.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian Corps {{operation}} {{was to be}} executed {{in a series of}} three attacks, each with limited objectives, delivered at intervals of three <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>days.</b> As the Canadian Corps position was directly south of the inter-army boundary between British Fifth and Second Army, the Fifth Army would mount subsidiary operations on the left flank of the Canadian Corps, while the I Anzac Corps would advance to protect the right flank and X Corps attacked Gheluvelt to improve the local tactical position and act as a diversion for the main attack in the north. Canadian Corps commander Lieutenant-General Arthur Currie submitted his provisional operational plan on 16 October and recommended the attack not be executed until 29 October, to move sufficient artillery forward. However, Haig was anxious to avoid any unnecessary delays, particularly given that he wished to assist the French attack on Malmaison, which was due to start on 23 October. Currie and the British Second Army commander, Herbert Plumer, re-examined the situation and finally set the attack for 26 October. The dates for the subsequent phases were tentatively given as 30 October and 6 November.|$|E

40|$|IntroductionHealth-related {{quality of}} life (HRQOL) refers to a person's or group's {{perceived}} {{physical and mental health}} over time. Coronary heart disease (CHD) affects HRQOL and likely varies among groups. This study examined disparities in HRQOL among adults with self-reported CHD. MethodsWe examined disparities in HRQOL by using the unhealthy days measurements among adults who self-reported CHD in the 2007 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System state-based telephone survey. CHD was based on self-reported medical history of heart attack, angina, or coronary heart disease. We assessed differences in fair/poor health status, 14 <b>or</b> <b>more</b> physically unhealthy <b>days,</b> 14 <b>or</b> <b>more</b> mentally unhealthy <b>days,</b> 14 <b>or</b> <b>more</b> total unhealthy <b>days</b> (total of physically and mentally unhealthy <b>days),</b> and 14 <b>or</b> <b>more</b> activity-limited <b>days.</b> Multivariate logistic regression models included age, race/ethnicity, sex, education, annual household income, household size, and health insurance coverage. ResultsOf the population surveyed, 35, 378 (6. 1 %) self-reported CHD. Compared with non-Hispanic whites, Native Americans {{were more likely to report}} fair/poor health status (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1. 7), 14 <b>or</b> <b>more</b> total unhealthy <b>days</b> (AOR, 1. 6), 14 <b>or</b> <b>more</b> physically unhealthy <b>days</b> (AOR, 1. 7), and 14 <b>or</b> <b>more</b> activity-limited <b>days</b> (AOR, 1. 9). Hispanics were more likely than non-Hispanic whites to report fair/poor health status (AOR, 1. 5) and less likely to report 14 <b>or</b> <b>more</b> activity-limited <b>days</b> (AOR, 0. 5), and Asians were less likely to report 14 <b>or</b> <b>more</b> activity-limited <b>days</b> (AOR, 0. 2). Non-Hispanic blacks did not differ in unhealthy days measurements from non-Hispanic whites. The proportion reporting 14 <b>or</b> <b>more</b> total unhealthy <b>days</b> increased with increasing age, was higher among women than men, and was lower with increasing levels of education and income. ConclusionThere are sex, racial/ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in HRQOL among people with CHD. Tailoring interventions to people who have both with CHD and poor HRQOL may assist in the overall management of CHD...|$|R

5|$|Under the {{direction}} of Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler and the supervision of SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich, the Einsatzgruppen operated in territories occupied by the German armed forces following the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and Operation Barbarossa (the invasion of the Soviet Union) launched from occupied Poland in June 1941. The Einsatzgruppen worked hand-in-hand with the Orpo Police Battalions on the Eastern Front to carry out operations ranging from {{the murder of a}} few people to operations which lasted over two <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>days,</b> such as the massacre at Babi Yar with 33,771 Jews killed in two days, and the Rumbula massacre (with about 25,000 killed in two days of shooting). As ordered by Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, the Wehrmacht cooperated with the Einsatzgruppen and provided logistical support for their operations. Historian Raul Hilberg estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the Einsatzgruppen and related auxiliary troops killed more than two million people, including 1.3 million Jews. The total number of Jews murdered during the Holocaust is estimated at 5.5 to 6 million people.|$|E
