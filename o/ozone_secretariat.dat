2500|$|Data {{reported}} to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) greenhouse gas emissions databases [...] indicate substantial decreases in developed or Annex 1 countries HFC-23 emissions from the 1990s to the 2000s (UNFCCC greenhouse gas emissions databases). The UNFCCC Clean Development Mechanism projects have provided funding and facilitated the destruction of HFC-23 co-produced from a portion of HCFC-22 produced in developing or non-Annex 1 countries since 2003. [...] Developing countries have become the largest producers of HCFC-22 in recent years according to data compiled by the <b>Ozone</b> <b>Secretariat</b> of the World Meteorological Organization. Emissions of all HFCs {{are included in the}} UNFCCCs Kyoto Protocol. To mitigate its impact, CHF3 can be destroyed with electric plasma arc technologies or by high temperature incineration.|$|E
50|$|His {{research}} also examines global {{efforts to prevent}} stratospheric ozone depletion, address global climate changehttp://unfccc.int/, and restrict anthropogenic emissions of mercury and of toxic chemicals known as persistent organic pollutants (POPs). He has attended dozens of global negotiations on these topics. At many of the meetings associated with the ozone layer http://ozone.unep.org, mercury http://www.mercuryconvention.org/Convention/tabid/3426/Default.aspx and POPs,http://www.pops.int/, he worked with the Secretariat {{as part of the}} team that drafted the official negotiation reports. For his informal work with the <b>Ozone</b> <b>Secretariat</b> at negotiations in the mid-to-late 1990s and his scholarly writing on global ozone policy from 1993-2014, he was nominated and awarded inclusion in the Montreal Protocol Who’s Who, a collection maintained by the United Nations Environment Programme’s OzonAction unit, “intended to honor the visionaries, innovators, and implementers who are making the Montreal Protocol a global environmental success story.”http://www.unep.fr/ozonaction/montrealprotocolwhoswho/PageFlip.asp Downie has also been a long-time advocate of examining opportunities to reduce state, national and international taxes and fees focused on income, especially those paid by the lower and middle classes, and replacing them with taxes on pollution. The author of numerous publications on a variety of topics, his co-authored book, Global Environmental Politics https://westviewpress.com/books/global-environmental-politics/, written with Professor Pamela Chasek (a co-creator of the Earth Negotiations Bulletin), {{is one of the most}} widely used in the field.|$|E
40|$|The Montreal Protocol has {{had great}} success in {{reducing}} the production and use {{of a number of}} known ozone depleting substances. As a result many alternatives to the banned substances have been developed. Some of these substances have, however, themselves ozone depleting properties or can be hazardous to the environment in other ways. As the procedure for including new ozone depleting substances under the regulation of the Montreal protocol is rather time consuming the parties to the Montreal Protocol have decided to encourage parties to take measures to actively discourage the production and marketing of new ozone depleting substances. Further it was decided to request parties to report to the <b>ozone</b> <b>secretariat</b> on new substances. EU has taken the effort to elaborate a table of 'New substances with ozone depletion potential'. Based on this list a shorter list of 7 substances of concern has been prepared by the Nordic Ozone Group for assessment in this study. The overall objective of the study is to contribute to the work on the protection of the ozone layer eventually by providing information which would facilitate the inclusion of new substances under the Montreal Protocol or by otherwise reducing the use of these substances if appropriate...|$|E
50|$|EPA Ghana has an ozone unit, {{tasked with}} phasing out ozone-depleting {{substances}} (ODS) after Ghana signed the Montreal Protocol, {{and information on}} ODS uss was collated for the multilateral fund and <b>ozone</b> <b>secretariats.</b> Refrigeration shops were monitored to ensure good practice and identify refrigerant brands on the market. Few shops had CFC12 and R134a, and shops {{with a mixture of}} refrigerants had them seized. R-406A, a new refrigerant compatible with CFC12 and HFC134a systems, was found in use. Seminars, with more than 1,420 participants, were held on good refrigeration practice, hydrocarbon as an alternative refrigerant and hydrocarbon technology transfer. The import of equipment using chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) was banned in 2010, and customs officers were trained in their detection. Applications for financial incentives from three cold-storage facilities were approved, and the facilities were inspected. EPA officers visited the three major foam-producing factories in Accra and Nsawam to ensure worker safety and environmental compliance.|$|R
