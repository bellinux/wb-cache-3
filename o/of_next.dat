5|$|Third class {{funerals}} were {{reserved for}} pauper funerals; those buried at parish expense {{in the section}} of the cemetery designated for that parish. Although the LNC was forbidden from using mass graves (other than the burial <b>of</b> <b>next</b> of kin in the same grave) and thus even the lowest class of funeral provided a separate grave for the deceased, third class funerals were not granted the right to erect a permanent memorial on the site. (The families of those buried could pay afterwards to upgrade a third class grave to a higher class if they later wanted to erect a memorial, but this practice was rare.) Despite this, Brookwood's pauper graves granted more dignity to the deceased than did other graveyards and cemeteries of the period, all of which other than Brookwood continued the practice of mass graves for the poor.|$|E

5|$|Xgrid's {{original}} concept can {{be traced}} back to Zilla.app, found in the OPENSTEP operating system, created by NeXT in the late 1980s. Zilla was the first distributed computing program released on an end-user operating system and which used the idle screen-saver motif, a design feature since found in widely used projects such as Seti@Home and Distributed.net. Zilla won the national Computerworld Smithsonian Award (Science Category) in 1991 for ease of use and good design.

5|$|During {{the truce}} of 1206–1208, John focused on {{building}} up his financial and military resources {{in preparation for}} another attempt to recapture Normandy. John used some of this {{money to pay for}} new alliances on Philip's eastern frontiers, where the growth in Capetian power was beginning to concern France's neighbours. By 1212 John had successfully concluded alliances with his nephew Otto IV, a contender for the crown of Holy Roman Emperor in Germany, {{as well as with the}} counts Renaud of Boulogne and Ferdinand of Flanders. The invasion plans for 1212 were postponed because of fresh English baronial unrest about service in Poitou. Philip seized the initiative in 1213, sending his elder son, Louis, to invade Flanders with the intention <b>of</b> <b>next</b> launching an invasion of England. John was forced to postpone his own invasion plans to counter this threat. He launched his new fleet to attack the French at the harbour of Damme. The attack was a success, destroying Philip's vessels and any chances of an invasion of England that year. John hoped to exploit this advantage by invading himself late in 1213, but baronial discontent again delayed his invasion plans until early 1214, in what was his final Continental campaign.|$|E
5|$|Theodore was {{released}} in 1237 when his daughter Irene married John Asen, and quickly managed {{to regain control of}} Thessalonica, ousting Manuel. Having been blinded during his captivity and thus disqualified from occupying the throne again, he installed his eldest son John as emperor, but remained the de facto regent of the state. Manuel tried to regain Thessalonica with Nicaean support, but a negotiated settlement was reached which gave him Thessaly and left Thessalonica and its environs to Theodore and John. In 1241, John III Vatatzes invited Theodore to visit Nicaea. He was welcomed and treated with great honour, but was effectively detained there until the spring <b>of</b> <b>next</b> year, when Vatatzes marched on Thessalonica with Theodore in tow. Theodore was sent in to negotiate with his son and convince him to accept demotion to the rank of Despot and to recognize the suzerainty of Nicaea. John died in 1244 and was succeeded by Theodore's younger son Demetrios. In 1246, Vatatzes overthrew the unpopular Demetrios and annexed Thessalonica. Theodore influenced his nephew Michael II to launch an attack on Thessalonica in 1251, but in 1252, Vatatzes campaigned against them and forced Michael to come to terms. Theodore was taken prisoner and sent into exile in Nicaea, where he died around 1253.|$|E

40|$|Purpose To {{identify}} symptoms/distress {{among patients}} with colorectal cancer undergoing chemotherapy, {{from the viewpoint}} <b>of</b> the <b>next</b> <b>of</b> kin, and to establish whether there are any barriers to reporting these problems. Methods Individual face-to-face interviews with fourteen <b>next</b> <b>of</b> kin were conducted. Qualitative content {{analysis was used to}} analyse the transcripts. Results Three areas were identified: symptoms presented, barriers to reporting symptoms/distress, and influences on life for the <b>next</b> <b>of</b> kin. Nine symptoms were raised as most common by the <b>next</b> <b>of</b> kin. Almost all the <b>next</b> <b>of</b> kin denied that they had experienced any barriers to reporting symptoms/distress but some did exist, namely barriers to proper communication and barriers <b>of</b> time. The <b>next</b> <b>of</b> kin made another interpretation of barriers; they did not interpret it as hinder or obstacle. All <b>next</b> <b>of</b> kin talked to a large extent about how the patient's disease and treatment affected them as <b>next</b> <b>of</b> kin. It affected them psychologically, they had to re-valuate their life, and it influenced their social life. Conclusions The symptoms reported during chemotherapy were similar to those found in other studies on patients. Barriers to reporting symptoms were mentioned, but not to a great extent. Although it was not the main purpose of the study, the <b>next</b> <b>of</b> kin raised concerns about the patient's disease and treatment and how it influenced <b>next</b> <b>of</b> kin life...|$|R

40|$|Background: There {{is little}} {{investigation}} into what care older people access {{during the last}} phase of their life and what factors enable access to care in this group. Illuminating this from the perspective <b>of</b> the <b>next</b> <b>of</b> kin may provide valuable insights into how the health and social care system operates with reference to providing care for this vulnerable group. The behavioural model of health services use has a wide field of application but has not been tested conceptually regarding access to care from the perspective <b>of</b> the <b>next</b> <b>of</b> kin. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the care accessed by older people during the last phase of their life from the perspective <b>of</b> the <b>next</b> <b>of</b> kin and to conceptually test the behavioural model of health services use. Methods: The data collection took place in 2011 by means of qualitative interviews with 14 <b>next</b> <b>of</b> kin of older people who had died in a nursing home. The interviews were analysed using directed content analysis. The behavioural model of health services use was used in deriving the initial coding scheme, including the categories: utilization of health services, consumer satisfaction and characteristics of the population at risk. Results: Utilization of health services in the last phase of life was described in five subcategories named after the type of care accessed i. e. admission to a nursing home, primary healthcare, hospital care, dental care and informal care. The needs were illuminated in the subcategories: general deterioration, medical conditions and acute illness and deterioration when death approaches. Factors that enabled access to care were described in three subcategories: the organisation <b>of</b> care, <b>next</b> <b>of</b> kin and the older person. These factors could also constitute barriers to accessing care. <b>Next</b> <b>of</b> kin’s satisfaction with care was illuminated in the subcategories: satisfaction, dissatisfaction and factors influencing satisfaction. One new category was constructed inductively: the situation <b>of</b> the <b>next</b> <b>of</b> kin...|$|R
