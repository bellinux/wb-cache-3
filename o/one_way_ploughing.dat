Portions of this open space between Merryland and Crown Street were lost to market stalls that turned into permanent buildings. Some of the shops in the town centre are still to the same layout as in Medieval times, one rod in width, the standard length for floor and roof joists. The lanes along the north side of town are believed to follow the layout of the narrow medieval fields, and are slightly S-shaped because of the <b>way</b> <b>ploughs</b> turned at each end.

40|$|In 2013, Farid and Vasiliev [arXiv:quant-ph/ 1310. 4922] for {{the first}} time {{proposed}} a way to construct a protocol for the realisation of "Classical to Quantum" <b>one</b> <b>way</b> hash function, a derivative of the Quantum <b>one</b> <b>way</b> function as defined by Gottesman and Chuang [Technical Report arXiv:quant-ph/ 0105032] and used for constructing quantum digital signatures. We, on the other hand, {{for the first}} time, propose the idea of a different kind of <b>one</b> <b>way</b> function which is "quantum-classical" in nature, that is, it takes an n-qubit quantum state of a definite class as its input and produces a classical output. We formally define such a <b>one</b> <b>way</b> function and propose a way to construct and realise it. The proposed <b>one</b> <b>way</b> function turns out to be very useful in authenticating a quantum state in any quantum money scheme and so we can construct many quantum money schemes based on such a <b>one</b> <b>way</b> function. Later in the paper, we also give explicit construction of quantum money schemes like quantum bitcoins and quantum currency schemes, solely based on the proposed <b>one</b> <b>way</b> function. The security of such schemes can be explained {{on the basis of the}} security of the underlying <b>one</b> <b>way</b> functions...|$|R
