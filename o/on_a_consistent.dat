5|$|The Mississippi ships had poor {{seakeeping}} qualities, {{making them}} poor gunnery platforms underway in Atlantic waters. Their motion was irregular, and their low length-to-beam ratio caused excessive rolling and pitching, {{which made it}} difficult to keep the guns on target. The reduced length, significantly cut away from the aft, {{made it difficult to}} keep the ships <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>consistent</b> course, even in smoother waters.|$|E

5|$|Three days later, the Italian {{invasion}} of Egypt began. Much to Pattle's distaste, the squadron was {{heavily involved in}} close air support operations and ordered specifically to avoid air-to-air combat unless attacked. On occasion, he chanced upon Italian aircraft, but the Gladiator's limited speed denied Pattle further success. Pattle succeeded in damaging a Savoia-Marchetti S.79 bomber which emitted black smoke but dived away and Pattle could not catch it. The speed of the Savoia-Marchetti S.79 enabled it to escape the RAF fighters <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>consistent</b> basis. The unit withdrew to Habbaniyah to re-equip with Mark II machines, but was then ordered to Greece after the Italian attack.|$|E

5|$|Today, all {{minor league}} teams are {{affiliated}} with a Major League Baseball team. The purpose of a minor league club is to develop players for the major league team.

Nashville was affiliated with eight major league teams throughout its existence: the Cleveland Indians (1908), Chicago White Sox (1920), New York Giants (1934–1935 and 1952–1954), Cincinnati Reds (1936–1937 and 1955–1960), Brooklyn Dodgers (1938–1940), Chicago Cubs (1943–1951), Minnesota Twins (1961), and Los Angeles Angels (1963).|$|E

Buttler played again in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 in India in March and played regular one-day cricket again throughout the year. He scored his maiden One-Day International century against Sri Lanka at Lord's in May, scoring 121 in 61 balls with nine fours and four sixes, the fastest century by any England batsman. After first choice wicket-keeper Matt Prior stood down after injury on the 22 July 2014, Buttler was called up for the England squad for the third Test against India. He made 85 runs from 83 balls in his first Test innings. He played in the final three Tests of the series before reverting back to one-day duty, touring Sri Lanka {{at the end of}} the year.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} at least two {{successful}} attempts to formalize probability, namely the Kolmogorov formulation and the Cox formulation.

In Cox's theorem, probability is taken as a primitive (that is, not further analyzed) and the emphasis is <b>on</b> constructing <b>a</b> <b>consistent</b> assignment of probability values to propositions.

25|$|The {{levelized cost}} of {{electricity}} (LCOE) {{is a measure of}} a power source which attempts to compare different methods of electricity generation <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>consistent</b> basis. It is an economic assessment of the average total cost to build and operate a power-generating asset over its lifetime divided by the total energy output of the asset over that lifetime. The LCOE can also be regarded as the average minimum cost at which electricity must be sold in order to break-even over the lifetime of the project.|$|E
