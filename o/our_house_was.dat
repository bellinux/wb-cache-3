6000|$|... "It was a {{good thing}} <b>our</b> <b>House</b> <b>was</b> adjourned before these {{disturbances}} in Lancashire," [...] said Lord Bardolf to Lord de Mowbray.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Saunders Souplejaw, hold thine own!--thou always saidst {{the fortune}} of <b>our</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> {{to be won}} by marriage, and never had you such a chance to keep your word with us." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Home isn't where <b>our</b> <b>house</b> <b>is,</b> but {{wherever}} we are understood." ...|$|R
50|$|The three {{surviving}} {{episodes of}} <b>Our</b> <b>House</b> <b>were</b> released on DVD on 16 July 2012.|$|R
50|$|From Bauhaus to <b>Our</b> <b>House</b> <b>is</b> a 1981 {{narrative}} of Modern architecture, written by Tom Wolfe.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{happened}} to him--do you know? The reason he stopped coming to <b>our</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> some misunderstanding with my father, of course. I am positive {{my mother never}} changed her feelings toward him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{plausible}} explanation, but I'm {{not sure}} it's good," [...] Wyndham {{replied with a}} smile. [...] "The head of <b>our</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> often extravagant but never, I think, a miser. We're not a greedy lot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother never {{objects to}} anything," [...] she said. [...] "She thinks our rooms are very neat and comfortable, and that Mrs. Brinkly {{is a kind}} landlady, but she has complained {{a great deal of}} the heat. You know <b>our</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> very airy." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Our</b> <b>House</b> <b>is</b> a British sitcom that {{aired on}} ITV from 1960 to 1962. The main {{writer of the}} programme, which starred many actors known for their roles in the Carry On films, was Norman Hudis, who wrote the first six Carry On films from 1958 to 1962. <b>Our</b> <b>House</b> <b>is</b> {{based on the premise}} of nine people of differing {{backgrounds}} sharing a house together.|$|R

6000|$|... "That is nothing." [...] Nam-Bok {{shrugged his}} {{shoulders}} in belittling fashion. [...] "As <b>our</b> <b>houses</b> <b>are</b> to that <b>house,</b> so that <b>house</b> <b>was</b> to the <b>houses</b> I <b>was</b> yet to see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{night there}} came a violent {{thunderstorm}} and <b>our</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> struck by lightning. The only damage done was to one corner in which was located Uncle Pierre's writing desk. The desk was ripped apart by the lightning bolt {{and some of his}} precious manuscripts were burnt.|$|E
60|$|This visitor was {{the same}} Indian girl I had seen making bread, and quite by chance <b>our</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> the first she looked into, which caused me much pride, for I {{believed}} she was attracted to {{it because it was}} more cleanly than many of the others.|$|E
60|$|I {{have had}} to incur a huge vague debt for {{cleaning}} sewers; <b>our</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> (of course) riddled with hidden cesspools, but that was infallible. I have the fever, and feel the duty to work very heavy on me at times; yet go it must. I {{have had to}} leave FONTAINEBLEAU, when three hours would finish it, and go full-tilt at tushery for a while. But it will come soon.|$|E
6000|$|They {{were all}} delighted. 'Quick,' he ordered them, 'bring me {{each of you}} the best of what we have. Gut <b>our</b> <b>house.</b> <b>Be</b> sharp.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{the fight}} is over," [...] replied the Highlander, sternly, [...] "but it has cost us much. <b>Our</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> on fire and Reuben is--" ...|$|R
50|$|Save Us From <b>Our</b> <b>House!</b> <b>is</b> a Canadian reality series, which premiered on W Network in Canada in 2005. The {{series was}} {{produced}} by General Purpose Pictures.|$|R
6000|$|... "He's a very good-natured fellow. It was decent {{of him to}} put me up at the Albany while <b>our</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> let. By the way, he {{has some}} seats for {{the first night of}} a new piece this evening. He {{suggested}} that we might all dine at the Albany and go on to the theatre." [...] He hesitated a moment. [...] "Jill will be there," [...] he said, and felt easier now that her name had at last come into the talk. [...] "She's longing to meet you." ...|$|E
60|$|Because <b>our</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} to be put up in the new village, and, being made of logs, was by far the best shelter, even in {{comparison}} with the tents of cloth, Nathaniel and I decided that it should be the most homelike, if indeed that could be compassed where were no women to keep things cleanly. I am in doubt as to whether Captain Smith, great traveler and brave adventurer though he was, had even realized that with only men to perform the household duties, there would be much lack of comfort.|$|E
6000|$|As I {{grew older}} my liberty encreased with my desires, and my wanderings {{extended}} from our park to the neighbouring country. <b>Our</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> {{situated on the}} shores of the lake and the lawn came down to the water's edge. I rambled amidst the wild scenery of this lovely country and became a complete mountaineer: I passed hours on the steep brow of a mountain that overhung a waterfall or rowed myself in a little skiff to some one of the islands. I wandered for ever about these lovely solitudes, gathering flower after flower ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{were all}} delighted. [...] "Quick," [...] he ordered them, [...] "bring me {{each of you}} the best of what we have. Gut <b>our</b> <b>house.</b> <b>Be</b> sharp." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Our</b> <b>House</b> <b>is</b> a British {{entertainment}} television programme. Broadcast on UKTV Style, it {{is a show}} {{which more}} thoroughly follows the DIY show fad of the late 1990s.|$|R
6000|$|... "Looks {{as if we}} {{were all}} in it," [...] Jefferson commented. [...] "On the whole, I'm {{satisfied}} <b>our</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> not. I'd rather like to know what Revillon thinks." ...|$|R
60|$|About {{three miles}} from <b>our</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> a {{settlement}} known as New Dublin. It was a cluster of poor and doleful houses, inhabited entirely by Irish people, whose dirt and poverty seemed to make them very contented and happy. The men were generally away, at their work, during the day, {{but there was never}} any difficulty in finding some one at home, no matter at what house one called. I was acquainted with one of the matrons of this locality, a Mrs. Duffy, who had occasionally undertaken some odd jobs at our house, and to her I made a visit.|$|E
60|$|My {{mother was}} a clever and thrifty housekeeper, and I think she made more of the peach than any other {{resident}} {{in the country who}} possessed an orchard. Her peach preserves, which lasted us the year round, were celebrated in our neighbourhood. Peach preserves were in most English houses, but <b>our</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> alone in making pickled peaches: I think this was an invention of her own; I do not know if it has taken on, but we always had pickled peaches on the table and preferred them to all other kinds, and so did every person who tasted them.|$|E
60|$|We {{went down}} to Ginx's in the first boat, having {{arranged}} that our furniture {{should be sent to}} us in the afternoon. We wanted to be there to receive it. The trip was just wildly delirious. The air was charming. The sun was bright, and I had a whole holiday. When we reached Ginx's we found {{that the best way to}} get our trunks and ourselves to <b>our</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> to take a carriage, and so we took one. I told the driver to drive along the river road and I would tell him where to stop.|$|E
5000|$|... "We're {{homeless}} now. So many of <b>our</b> <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> {{burned out}} after we left," [...] Xu said. [...] "We can't go back or else we'll be beaten. We're like refugees." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said I, [...] "you have {{no right}} to ask to be accommodated; for, as you may see from the sign, <b>our</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> only for soldiers, sailors, farmers, and mechanics." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes!' {{continued}} Ferdinand; 'this {{is the end}} of {{all your}} care, all your affection, all your hopes, all your sacrifices. It <b>is</b> over; <b>our</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> fated; my life draws to an end.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! Se√±ora, was not {{my husband}} proud the day he went with a company to the church for the christening of our child? Many {{relatives}} had arrived from Los Angeles and from Ventura, so that <b>our</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> overflowing with cheer. The kitchen and the court were gay with preparations from morning until evening. Although I could not go myself to the church, my husband told me joyfully how the dear old Father who had married us the year before took in his arms our boy, blessing him with double certainty when he kissed his little cheek.|$|E
60|$|The {{village in}} which we lived {{contained}} a goodly number of families of high standing and comfortable fortune. It was a village of well-kept and well-shaded streets, of close-cut grass, with no litter on the sidewalks. <b>Our</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> {{one of the best}} in the place, and since I had come of age I had greatly improved it. I had a fair inheritance from my mother, and this my grandmother desired me to expend without reference to what I was receiving and would receive from her. To her son's son would come ultimately everything that she possessed.|$|E
60|$|This I {{said with}} some {{reasonable}} dread--fearing, {{in the first}} place, her refusal; in the second, her acceptance of the invitation, with a proposal, as <b>our</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> large, to come herself and inhabit it for a while. Had I not seen that Campaigner arrive for a month at poor James Binnie's house in Fitzroy Square, and stay there for many years? Was I not aware that when she once set her foot in a gentleman's establishment, terrific battles must ensue before she could be dislodged? Had she not once been routed by Clive? and was she not now in command and possession? Do I not, finally, know something of the world; and have I not a weak, easy temper? I protest it was with terror that I awaited the widow's possible answer to my proposal.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Cartwright gave Lister {{her hand}} and her glance was very kind. [...] "You will come back? So long as you stop here I hope you will feel <b>our</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> open to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This plaint is thine, as I learn, brother Ambrose," [...] said he. [...] "May {{the holy}} Benedict, patron of <b>our</b> <b>house,</b> <b>be</b> present {{this day and}} aid us in our findings! How many counts are there?" ...|$|R
