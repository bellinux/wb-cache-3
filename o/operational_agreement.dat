50|$|On April 23, 2007 in {{an attempt}} to boost continual anemic ratings, WAGT decided to drop the CW Augusta Now title and its fast-paced format {{replacing}} it with a more traditional newscast. However, NBC Augusta News at 10 was still unable to mount a strong challenge and alternative to WFXG's newscast so it was cancelled in April 2008. WJBF continued producing local news for WFXG despite entering into <b>operational</b> <b>agreements</b> with WAGT in October 2009. As a result, some reporters and video footage from that outlet began to be seen on the Fox affiliate.|$|R
50|$|Following a {{national}} trend among television stations, WAGT's continual third-place ranking and low advertising sales resulted in Schurz Communications handing over daily operations to Media General and rival WJBF.

As a result, some reporters and video footage from this station {{began to be}} seen on WFXG.

On August 1, 2016, {{as a result of}} the end of the SSA, NBC and MyNetworkTV programming previously seen on WISE moved to subchannels of WPTA, and The CW moved to WISE, which is now independently operated by SagamoreHill Broadcasting without entering into any further <b>operational</b> <b>agreements</b> with Quincy.|$|R

40|$|Using the {{check-in}} area of {{a generic}} airport as an example, investigations were carried out as to whether – and if so, how – <b>operational</b> <b>agreements</b> between various process stakeholders {{have an effect on}} traffic progress. Individual passenger prioritisations decide whether a person is treated with priority at the common security control point which is a critical element of the infrastructure. In the model, status group division takes place at boarding card control. Instead of membership to a passenger class or frequent-flier bonus programme, traffic aspects are now the defining factor in guaranteeing priorities. The investigations were carried out using a microscopic fast-time simulation. A variety of strategies recommend themselves with regard to maximising the number of passengers who can actually catch their flight, depending on the capacity load...|$|R
