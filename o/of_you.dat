[Then {{as she sees}} the Shepherd of THE COW HORN {{standing}} there] I know <b>thee</b> now--Life <b>of</b> the earth--the smell <b>of</b> <b>thee,</b> the sight <b>of</b> <b>thee,</b> the taste <b>of</b> <b>thee,</b> and all thy music. I have passed thee and gone by. [She moves away] ...|$|R

5|$|The {{recording}} finished as the forty-fourth {{album of}} the Billboard 200 of 1995 and finished at number 123 on the Billboard 200 albums of 1996.

Dreaming <b>of</b> <b>You</b> sold 420,500 copies between 1997 and 1999, and sold 190,000 units in 1997 alone. The biopic Selena (1997) contributed to a 65% increase of sales for Dreaming <b>of</b> <b>You</b> for that year. Dreaming <b>of</b> <b>You</b> sold half a million copies in Texas.

According to Behar, the sales figures Nielsen SoundScan provided did not include sales in small shops specializing in Latin music, where Dreaming <b>of</b> <b>You</b> scored well.
