40|$|This study {{aimed to}} develop an <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>insert</b> {{containing}} fluocinolone acetonide (FA), to apply in the posterior segment of the eye. The inserts were prepared by the hot-melt extrusion technique (HME) and contained 3 % FA and different polymeric materials chosen according to their suitability for extrusion and their potential use in ophthalmic field. The insert based on AMYLO-maize starch (AMYLO-FA) was {{selected on the basis}} of technological properties and in vitro drug release behavior. No substantial morphological changes following of AMYLO-FA in isotonic buffer solution hydration and swelling were observed up to 12 days. Drug release performance of AMYLO-FA, evaluated using Gummer-type diffusion cells to maintain the sink conditions, highlighted an anomalous non-Fickian release, and about 60 % of FA content was delivered over 8 days. The release rate of FA was also determined when the receiving phase was totally replaced every 24 h and 48 h simulating the biological conditions of a stagnant vitreous humour. In any case, the obtained FA release was linear during the 25 -day sampling period and release rates of 26. 76 and 10. 61 μg/day were obtained by replacing the receiving phase every 24 and 48 hours, respectively. Thus it seems that the FA release from the device was mainly influenced by the receiving environment rather than controlled from the insert...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{mydriatic}} efficacy of an <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>insert</b> (Mydriasert, MY) versus phenylephrine and tropicamide (PT) eye drops. METHODS: Two controlled, prospective, randomized, single-blind studies were performed. In the first study, {{a total of}} 80 eyes from 40 outpatient-clinic patients were analyzed. PT drops were applied to the right eye, and a MY device was inserted in the left eye for 30 min. Time until maximal pupil dilation for each eye was then assessed. In the second study, 80 eyes from 80 patients undergoing cataract surgery were analyzed. Pupil dilation was achieved using either PT drops three-times for one hour prior to surgery (40 patients), or a MY device was inserted one hour prior to surgery (40 patients). RESULTS: In the first study, MY achieved superior mydriasis compared to PT eye drops at 90 min (9. 04 +/- 1. 33 mm vs 8. 78 +/- 1. 37 mm, P= 0. 012). However MY took longer than PT drops to achieve maximal dilation, and mydriasis was inferior in eyes with MY compared to PT drops at 30 min (7. 21 +/- 1. 73 mm vs 8. 22 +/- 1. 43 mm, P < 0. 001), the two groups only becoming similar by 60 min (8. 85 +/- 1. 44 mm vs 8. 71 +/- 1. 27 mm, P= 0. 236). In the second study, both MY and PT achieved similar levels of mydriasis {{at the beginning of}} surgery (8. 75 +/- 0. 76 mm with MY vs 8. 77 +/- 0. 63 mm with PT), and also at the end of surgery (7. 96 +/- 1. 06 mm with MY vs 8. 32 +/- 0. 72 mm with PT), with no significant difference between groups (P= 0. 08). MY was well tolerated and cardiovascular effects were not influenced by dilation method. CONLUSION: MY could be a safe and efficacious alternative for mydriasis. The mydriatic effect of MY is as good as conventional PT eye drops after 60 min, and is superior after 90 min. MY also maintains good pupil dilation during cataract surgery...|$|E

40|$|Background: Ophthalmic drug {{delivery}} systems are the challenging subject for the researchers because of delicate nature of ocular membrane and preventive barriers leading {{to less than}} 1 % of Bioavailability. Reasons for reduced bioavailability are due to rapid pre corneal elimination, tear turnover, lacrimal drainage, blinking and degradation by enzymes. Less bioavailability causes short duration of action and increased frequency of administration. Materials and Methods: Timolol maleate was used as model drug. Dynamic drug release studies were used to study the polymeric hydrogels and <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>inserts.</b> Rheological {{studies were carried out}} by Brookfield Viscometer LVDV- II+.

40|$|Forskolin is {{the first}} {{pharmaceutical}} drug and product derived from a plant to be approved in India by the DCGI in 2006. Forskolin (7 beta-acetoxy- 8, 13 -epoxy- 1 a, 6 β, 9 a-trihydroxy-labd- 14 -en- 11 -one) is a diterpenoid isolated from plant Coleus forskohlii (Lamiaceae). It is a lipid-soluble compound that can penetrate cell membranes and stimulates the enzyme adenylate cyclase which, in turn, stimulates ciliary epithelium to activate cyclic adenosine monophosphate, which decreases intraocular pressure (IOP) by reducing aqueous humor inflow. The topical application of forskolin is capable of reducing IOP in rabbits, monkeys, and humans. In its drug interactions, forskolin may act synergistically with epinephrine, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. Whereas the effects of anti-clotting medications like warfarin, clopidogre, aspirin, anoxaparin, etc., may be enhanced by forskolin.

The MTs (diameter 3. 5 mm, thickness 1. 5 mm, average TiM content 0. 34 or 0. 68 mg) were prepared by compressing appropriate mixtures of powders with a standard tabletting machine. A thin, rate- controlling membrane was applied over the devices by spraying aqueous dispersions of acrylic copolymers. A first series of different (uncoated and coated) MTs were tested for release of TiM to the lacrimal fluid, using commercial eyedrops (Timoptol® 0. 5 %) as a reference standard. Two MTs (one of which was coated) and the same reference solution were then selected for an ocular absorption study. Analysis of TiM in the aqueous humor indicated that the coated MT was capable of maintaining low and steady levels of TiM for at least 19 h, while the other device, identical but uncoated, produced a prolonged-pulse effect lasting about 8 h.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{fabricate}} biodegradable <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>inserts</b> for controlled delivery of pilocarpine and evaluate them by both in-vitro and in-vivo studies. Emphasis {{was placed on the}} use of an inexpensive material as a drug carrier and on the ease of fabrication of the device. Based on these criteria, absorbable gelatin was selected to fabricate a matrix system. Absorbable gelatin can be obtained by either thermal treatment or chemical crosslinking of gelatin. In {{the first part of this}} project, we fabricated an insert using Gelfoamᴿ, an absorbable gelatin sponge obtained by thermal treatment. A prolonged in-vitro release of pilocarpine from the device was achieved through pharmaceutical modification by embedding a retardant in the pores. The devices impregnated with polyethylene glycol monostearate (PMS) and cetyl esters wax (CEW) were found to be most effective. The in-vivo evaluation of the devices indicated that pharmaceutical modification of Gelfoamᴿ is an effective means of improving the biological activity of pilocarpine without altering the biodegradability of the biopolymer backbone. The CEW device produces a substantial improvement in drug bioavailability and an increase in the duration of biological effect over that from the two commercial formulations, the eyedrop and the gel. In the second part of the project, we fabricated absorbable gelatin inserts through chemical crosslinking of gelatin. The effect of selected fabrication variables on profiles of the in-vitro release of pilocarpine and the dynamic water uptake by the crosslinked gelatin devices was investigated. These results were further substantiated by the measurement of the degree of crosslinking of gelatin. The in-vivo study indicated that the modification of the structure of gelatin by crosslinking is another simple and effective way of improving bioavailability and extending the duration of effect of pilocarpine incorporated in the biopolymeric device. In addition, altering the degree of crosslinking of gelatin allows a variation of the biodegradation time of the polymer...|$|R

40|$|Glaucoma {{is a slow}} {{progressive}} degeneration of the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and {{the optic}} nerve axons, leading to irreversible blindness if left undiagnosed and untreated. Although increased intraocular pressure is a major risk factor of glaucoma, other factors include increased glutamate levels, alterations in nitric oxide (NO) metabolism, vascular alterations and oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species. Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness globally, accounting for 12. 3 % of the total blindness. Glaucoma has been broadly classified as primary or secondary open-angle or angle-closure glaucoma. The primary goal in management of glaucoma is to prevent the risk factor, especially elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), using medications, laser therapy or conventional surgery. The first-line treatment of glaucoma usually begins {{with the use of}} a topical selective or nonselective blocker or a prostaglandin analog. Second-line drugs of choice include alpha-agonists and topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Cholinergic agonists are considered third-line treatment options. When a single therapy is not sufficient to lower the IOP, a combination therapy is indicated. To enhance the patient compliance, drug delivery systems like electronic devices, ocular inserts, tansdermal and mechanical drug delivery systems have been developed. Use of viscoelastic agents in ophthalmic formulations, emulsions and soluble <b>ophthalmic</b> drug <b>inserts</b> (SODI) enhance patience compliance and ocular drug delivery in patients in long-term glaucoma therapy. For patients who do not respond to antiglaucoma medications, laser trabeculoplasty and incisional surgery are recommended.

Future directions for the development of a novel therapy glaucoma may target glutamate inhibition, NMDA receptor blockade, exogenously applied neurotrophins, open channel blockers, antioxidants, protease inhibitors and gene therapy...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this thesis is the {{development}} of an <b>ophthalmic</b> biodegradable <b>insert</b> containing fluocinolone acetonide (FA), to apply in the posterior segment of the eye. The inserts under study were prepared using the hot-melt extrusion technique (HME). In a previous study, an insert based on hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC-FA) was selected as the best with respect {{to a wide range of}} devices tested. New inserts containing amylo-maize starch N- 400 (AMYLO), corn starch (CS) or corn starch with magnesium stearate (CS-MS) were prepared. All inserts were added of 3 % FA (AMYLO-FA, CS-FA and CS-MS-FA, respectively). Swelling and dissolution properties of the new inserts were analysed in isotonic buffer saline (PBS) by a visual examination. During the examination time (up to 12 days), AMYLO-FA produced no changes in terms of dissolution and gel-like transformation in addition to an initial hydration and light swelling compared to the inserts containing CS; so it has appeared the most suitable for further studies. The physicochemical characteristics of the selected inserts (HPC-FA and AMYLO-FA) were determined by a) in vitro drug release and by b) differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Drug release performance of AMYLO-FA and HPC-FA inserts was comparatively evaluated using Gummer-type diffusion cells up to 52 h, maintaining the sink conditions (continuous receiving phase replacement), to evaluate the device influence on the FA release independently to the surrounding environment. During the time observed, HPC-FA released the drug too quickly (89 % of drug released) for our goal unlike AMYLO-FA that showed a remarkable reduction of FA release (36. 13 %). The test on AMYLO-FA was continued for 8 days and a slow but continuous release was obtained to reach 63. 66 % of FA at the end of the experiment. A controlled drug delivery with zero order kinetics could be hypothesized when AMYLO-FA release process reached the steady-state. The release rate of FA from AMYLO-FA insert was also determined when the receiving phase (PBS) was totally replaced every 24 h and 48 h simulating the biological conditions: vitreous humor turnover is considered stagnant. For both performed experiment protocols FA release from AMYLO-FA insert was linear during the 25 -day sampling period but the release rate decreased by half for sampling 48 hours. Then it would seem that the release of the drug from the device was mainly influenced and driven by the receiving environment rather than from the insert. The DSC analysis of AMYLO-FA (as physical mixture and extruded) suggested that no polymer-drug interaction occurred using the HME and this means that the release of the drug might depend only on the modified polymer structure. The second part of this thesis aimed at tuning up cylindrical matrices by freeze-drying for administration of vancomycin (VA) in the precorneal area to produce a sustained release of drug and consequently to reduce the number of applications. The matrices prepared contained hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and VA in ratio 0. 25 to 1 and were subjected to a) in vitro release study and b) DSC analysis. HPMC-VA matrix released the drug very slowly for our goal, may be due to a drug-polymer interaction during the freeze-drying process. DSC analysis of lyophilized matrix and the single components would suggest this hypothesis...|$|R
