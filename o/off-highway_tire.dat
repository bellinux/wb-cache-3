40|$|<b>Off-highway</b> <b>tire</b> costs {{represent}} {{a significant portion}} of the total mining costs in openpit, truck-shovel operations. To extend the lives of tires, the site-specific factors influencing tire life should be investigated. Valuable data can be obtained by combining historical operational data captured by a mine dispatch system with detailed tire and maintenance histories. Assuming that failure counts satisfy a Poisson distribution, F-tests can be applied to determine significant deviations from desired or target counts. The methodology developed in this paper can be used to identify the haul routes and loading and dumping zones that have significantly higher incidences of tire failure. Corrective action can then be targeted at these zones by modifying the shovel or truck operator practices; changing the haul route maintenance and clean up practices; or altering the bench, ramp or waste dump design parameters. An example is given of the correlation of tire separation and tire impact failures with haul routes for a fleet of nine Caterpillar 793 C trucks in operation at the Chuquicamata Mine in northern Chile. A high incidence of impact failures was observed for the 2 ̆ 7 ex-pit ore crusher and for tires installed in the left outer rear position on the trucks. The latter was postulated to be due to a preference for drivers to execute right-hand turns prior to dumping. Recommendations were made to revise crusher and dump cleanup practices and investigate the feasibility of super-elevating the surface of dumping zones to reduce ground pressure on the left rear tires...|$|E

50|$|Heavy {{equipment}} requires specialized tires {{for various}} construction applications. While {{many types of}} equipment have continuous tracks applicable to more severe service requirements, tires are used where greater speed or mobility is required. An understanding of what equipment {{will be used for}} during the life of the tires is required for proper selection. Tire selection can {{have a significant impact on}} production and unit cost. There are three types of off-the-road tires, transport for earthmoving machines, work for slow moving earth moving machines, and load and carry for transporting as well as digging. <b>Off-highway</b> <b>tires</b> have six categories of service C compactor, E earthmover, G grader, L loader, LS log-skidder and ML mining and logging. Within these service categories are various tread types designed for use on hard-packed surface, soft surface and rock. Tires are a large expense on any construction project, careful consideration should be given to prevent excessive wear or damage.|$|R
