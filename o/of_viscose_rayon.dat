Electrospun aligned poly L-lactic acid fibres (2 – 10 μ m) were bound to form fibres with {{a broad range of}} diameters (2 – 120 μ m) and then constructed in a specifically designed 3 D cell culture system. Human dermal fibroblasts were introduced to one end of the free-standing fibres using a fibrin clot and encouraged to ‘walk the plank’.

A thin layer <b>of</b> electrospun <b>viscose</b> <b>rayon</b> scaffold fibres (diameter 30 – 50 μ m, pore size 50 – 300 μ m) was also constructed in the 3 D cell culture system. After introduction to the scaffold using cells contained within a fibrin clot, fibroblasts were observed to stratify and also elongate between fibres in order to occupy voids. An interfibre span of up to 200 μ m was possible by a single fibroblast, but more commonly void distances were spanned by cellular multilayering. In contrast, HaCaT keratinocytes cultured under identical conditions using <b>viscose</b> <b>rayon</b> scaffolds occupied very much smaller void distances of 50 – 80 μ m predominantly by stratification...|$|R

Around the same time, Hermann Leuchs reported the synthesis of amino acid N-carboxyanhydrides and their high molecular weight products upon reaction with nucleophiles, but stopped short of referring to these as polymers, possibly due to the strong views espoused by Emil Fischer, his direct supervisor, denying the possibility of any covalent molecule exceeding 6,000 daltons.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{oxidative}} {{thermal stability}} <b>of</b> microcrystalline plant-based <b>viscose</b> <b>rayon</b> cellulose fiber was improved {{in the presence}} of an ammonium sulfate solution. The structural characterization of the oxidized samples was carried out using a combination of fiber thickness, linear density, burning test, X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric anal-ysis (TGA), and infrared (IR) spectroscopy measurements. Oxidized <b>viscose</b> <b>rayon</b> fibers showed physical and chemical transforma-tions with increasing oxidation temperature and were characterized by a reduction in fiber diameter and linear density values together with color changes with increasing oxidation temperature. The results obtained from XRD analysis showed the loss of crystallinity due to the amorphization processes. XRD analysis also showed increasing conversion to a highly crosslinked and cyclized structure with progressing temperature. The DSC and TGA measurements indicated that there was an improvement in thermal stability. The results obtained from IR spectra showed the progress of dehydrogenation and dehydration reactions.

Borate compounds have properties of multifunctional smoke suppressants, flame retardants, and afterglow suppressants. In this study, borate was coupled onto the surface <b>of</b> <b>viscose</b> <b>rayon</b> felt. Coupling and carbonization were confirmed by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infra-red (ATR FTIR). The initial carbonization temperature was certified with ATR FTIR, elemental analysis of carbon, and thermogravimetric analysis. In the carbonization step, all chemical groups of {{the surface of the}} viscose rayon felt degraded to the various gases. Moreover, the weight percentage of the carbon element increased with increasing carbonization temperature. Initial rapid thermal degradation temperatures <b>of</b> <b>viscose</b> <b>rayon</b> prepared at various temperatures increased with the increasing reaction tem-perature. The activation energy was calculated with the Freeman and Carroll method. The activation energy of borate-coupled viscose rayon decreased much more than before coupling. However, the activation energy increased with the increasing carbonization temperature in the carbonization step. Viscose rayon borates showed higher limiting oxygen index (LOI) values and volumetric resistance rate values than viscose rayon phosphates. In this article, the relationship between the activation energy and LOI is studied. The synthesized viscose rayon borate is found to be highly effective as a flam...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Effects {{of carbon}} {{disulphide}} (CS 2) on conduction velocity in sciatic and tibial nerve were investigated in rats exposed to CS 2 vapour at concentrations of 0 - 9 mg/I or 1 6 mg/l of air for periods of 1 - 5, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The conduction velocity was measured {{on the day}} following each exposure period, and again, three and {{six months after the}} last day of exposure. The majority of exposed rats showed a reduction in conduction velocity on the day after exposure: the extent of this reduction was dependent on the CS 2 concentration and the duration of exposure. Exposure for 1 5 months to 1 - 6 mg CS 2 / 1 produced temporary and fully reversible impairment of conduction velocity. Increased exposure to CS 2 (3, 6 or 9 months at 1 - 6 mg/l; 6 or 12 months at 0 9 mg/l CS 2 in air) caused a reduction in velocity which was only partially reversible. Peripheral neuropathy caused by carbon disulphide (CS 2) poisoning has been recognised since {{the second half of the}} nineteenth century.
