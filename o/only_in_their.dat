5|$|Athens {{became a}} center for music in the region during the Civil War and gained further fame {{in the early twentieth}} century with the {{founding}} of the Morton Theatre, which was a major touring destination for African American performers. The city's local rock music scene can be traced to the 1950s, with live music at Allen's Hamburgers in Normaltown. International attention came in the 1970s when the B-52's began releasing the first of several best-selling recordings. Athens-based rock bands have performed in a wide array of styles, and the city has never had a characteristic style of rock; most of the bands have been united <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> quirky and iconoclastic image.|$|E
5|$|For his {{doctoral}} thesis, Ehlers {{turned to}} a question that was to shape his lifetime research. He sought exact solutions of Einstein's equations: model universes consistent with the laws of general relativity that are simple enough to allow for an explicit description in terms of basic mathematical expressions. These exact solutions {{play a key role}} when it comes to building general-relativistic models of physical situations. However, general relativity is a fully covariant theory – its laws are the same, independent of which coordinates are chosen to describe a given situation. One direct consequence is that two apparently different exact solutions could correspond to the same model universe, and differ <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> coordinates. Ehlers began to look for serviceable ways of characterizing exact solutions invariantly, that is, in ways that do not depend on coordinate choice. In order to do so, he examined ways of describing the intrinsic geometric properties of the known exact solutions.|$|E

5|$|Some pre-Code movies {{suffered}} {{irreparable damage}} from censorship after 1934. When studios attempted to re-issue films from the 1920s and early 1930s, {{they were forced}} to make extensive cuts. Films such as Mata Hari (1931), Arrowsmith (1931), and A Farewell to Arms (1932) exist <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> censored versions. Many other films survived intact because they were too controversial to be re-released, such as The Maltese Falcon (1931), which was remade a decade later with the same name, and thus never had their master negatives edited. In the case of Convention City (1933), which Breen would not allow to be re-released in any form, the entire film remains missing. Although it has been rumored that all prints and negatives were ordered destroyed by Jack Warner in the late thirties, further research shows the negative was in the vaults as late as 1948 when it was junked due to nitrate decomposition.|$|E
5|$|When {{the stars}} of a {{particular}} globular cluster are plotted on an HR diagram, in many cases {{nearly all of the}} stars fall upon a relatively well defined curve. This differs from the HR diagram of stars near the Sun, which lumps together stars of differing ages and origins. The shape of the curve for a globular cluster is characteristic of a grouping of stars that were formed at approximately the same time and from the same materials, differing <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> initial mass. As the position of each star in the HR diagram varies with age, the shape of the curve for a globular cluster can be used to measure the overall age of the star population.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid did {{not attend}} the Council of Hertford held in September 672, but he did send representatives. Among the council's resolutions was one postponing a {{decision}} on the creation of new dioceses, which affected Wilfrid later. Another ruling confirmed that the Roman calculation for the date of Easter should be adopted, and that bishops should act <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> own dioceses. During the middle 670s Wilfrid acted as middleman in the negotiations to return a Merovingian prince, Dagobert II, from his exile in Ireland to Gaul. Wilfrid {{was one of the first}} churchmen in Northumbria to utilise written charters as records of gifts to his churches. He ordered the creation of a listing of all benefactions received by Ripon, which was recited at the dedication ceremony.|$|E

25|$|When {{the images}} {{presented}} to the eyes differ <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> contours, rivalry {{is referred to as}} binocular contour rivalry. When the images {{presented to the}} eyes differ <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> colours, rivalry is referred to as binocular colour rivalry. When the images presented to the eyes differ <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> lightnesses, a form of rivalry called binocular lustre may be seen. When an image is presented to one eye and a blank field to the other, the image is usually seen continuously. This is referred to as contour dominance. Occasionally however, the blank field, or even the dark field of a closed eye, can become visible, making the image invisible for about as long as it would be invisible were it in rivalry with another image of equal stimulus strength. When an image is presented to one eye and a blank field to the other, introducing a different image onto the blank field usually results in that image being seen immediately. This is referred to as flash suppression.|$|E

25|$|Free and membrane-bound ribosomes differ <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> spatial distribution; {{they are}} {{identical}} in structure. Whether the ribosome {{exists in a}} free or membrane-bound state depends {{on the presence of}} an ER-targeting signal sequence on the protein being synthesized, so an individual ribosome might be membrane-bound when it is making one protein, but free in the cytosol when it makes another protein.|$|E
