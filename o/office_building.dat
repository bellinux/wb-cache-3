The General Assembly relocated {{to a large}} <b>office</b> <b>building</b> that had been built in 1865 and was already housing the Supreme Court.

In 1887, before the new statehouse had been completed, enough of the lower floors were usable for the government {{to move out of the}} cramped office space and begin holding sessions in the new structure.|$|E

However, through some amount of experiments based on rating tools for acoustical performances in green <b>office</b> <b>buildings,</b> the authors {{have come to the}} question about the effectiveness of green buildings' design strategies onto acoustical comfort in comparison to the conventional buildings. Thus, the objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the level of acoustic performance and occupants' satisfaction on their acoustic environment in green <b>office</b> <b>buildings</b> and in conventional <b>office</b> <b>buildings</b> in Malaysia. Two green <b>office</b> <b>buildings</b> and two conventional <b>office</b> <b>buildings</b> were chosen for the study. To investigate the acoustical performance, series of physical measurement were done to measure the relevant acoustical parameters. Occupants' satisfaction was studied through questionnaire surveys. Initial findings show that the acoustical performance in green <b>office</b> <b>buildings</b> is within the acceptable criteria range. However, in comparison to conventional buildings, it is considered unsatisfactory...|$|R
5|$|In February 1976, Koubek {{contributed a}} third {{high-rise}} <b>office</b> <b>building</b> to Farragut Square, {{this one a}} brick-and-solarized glass structure with a glass-and-aluminum penthouse at 818 Connecticut Avenue NW. His massive, grid-like 400 North Capitol Street, {{one of the few}} office buildings he designed with a plaza between two wings, opened in June. His 12-story International Square building—with its inverted setbacks above the Farragut West Washington Metro station, ninth-floor balcony with non-structural columns, interior atrium, and ground level set-back retail concourse—opened in November. Originally just a single <b>office</b> <b>building</b> on a corner for a city block, it expanded to occupy nearly the entire block with the addition of two almost identical towers in 1979 and 1980. (The atrium was upgraded and a fountain added in 1992.) Two blocks to the west, in April 1977 Koubek also designed a fairly nondescript <b>office</b> <b>building</b> at 1990 K Street NW.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} 2011 energy consumption, green house gas (GHG) emission, and ENERGY STAR Energy Performance Rating (EPR) data for 953 <b>office</b> <b>buildings</b> in New York City are examined. The data were made {{public as a}} result of New York City's local law 84. Twenty-one of these <b>office</b> <b>buildings</b> were {{identified}} as LEED-certified, providing the opportunity for direct comparison of energy performance data for LEED and non-LEED buildings of the same type, time frame, and geographical and climate region. With regard to energy consumption and GHG emission the LEED-certified buildings, collectively, showed no savings as compared with non-LEED buildings. The subset of the LEED buildings certified at the Gold level outperformed other NYC <b>office</b> <b>buildings</b> by 20 %. In contrast LEED Silver and Certified <b>office</b> <b>buildings</b> underperformed other NYC <b>office</b> <b>buildings.</b> The average EPR for the LEED buildings was 78, 10 pts higher than that for all NYC <b>office</b> <b>buildings,</b> raising questions about the validity and interpretation of these EPR's. This work suggests that LEED building certification is not moving NYC toward its goal of climate neutrality. The results also suggest the need to re-examine some aspects of ENERGY STAR's benchmarking tool...|$|R
40|$|Copyright c© 2008 by the authors. Doing Well by Doing Good? Green <b>Office</b> <b>Buildings</b> This paper {{provides}} the first credible {{evidence on the}} economic value of the certification of “green buildings ” in the commercial sector – value derived from impersonal market transactions rather than engineering estimates. We match publicly available information on the addresses of Energy-Star and LEED-rated <b>office</b> <b>buildings</b> to a commercial data source detailing the characteristics of U. S. <b>office</b> <b>buildings</b> and their rental rates. We analyze the micro data on 694 certified green buildings and on 7489 other <b>office</b> <b>buildings</b> located within a quarter mile of the certified buildings. We find systematic evidence that rents for green offices are about two percent higher than rents for comparable buildings located nearby. Effective rents, i. e., rents adjusted for the occupancy levels in <b>office</b> <b>buildings,</b> are about six percent higher in green buildings than in comparable <b>office</b> <b>buildings</b> nearby. At prevailing capitalization rates, conversion of the average non-green building to an equivalent green building would add more than $ 5 million in market value. These results are robust to the statistical models employed...|$|R

5|$|In 1974, Koubek {{was hired}} to help {{renovate}} the long-shuttered, historic Willard Hotel. The original hotel (consisting of six townhouses joined together) was built in 1816, renovated and enlarged by leaseholder Henry Willard in 1847, and the current 12-story structure erected in 1901. Due to mismanagement and competition from more modern hotels, the Willard closed in 1968. With the redevelopment of Pennsylvania Avenue in the 1960s and 1970s, the Willard was threatened repeatedly with demolition. In May 1974, the National Trust for Historic Preservation paid Koubek $25,000 to study saving the hotel, either as a hotel, as a mixed-used structure, or as an <b>office</b> <b>building.</b> The Willard's owners, Charles Benenson and Robert Arnow, had earlier commissioned Koubek to design a modern <b>office</b> <b>building</b> for the site which would have required demolition of the structure.|$|E
