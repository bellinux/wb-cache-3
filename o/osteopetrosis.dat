25|$|MMP-13 is {{believed}} to be involved in bone resorption and in osteoclast differentiation, as knockout mice revealed decreased osteoclast numbers, <b>osteopetrosis,</b> and decreased bone resorption.|$|E
25|$|Thirteen other syndromes may exhibit signs {{similar to}} Usher syndrome, {{including}} Alport syndrome, Alstrom syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, Cockayne syndrome, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, Flynn-Aird syndrome, Friedreich ataxia, Hurler syndrome (MPS-1), Kearns-Sayre syndrome (CPEO), Norrie syndrome, <b>osteopetrosis</b> (Albers-Schonberg disease), Refsum's disease (phytanic acid storage disease), and Zellweger syndrome (cerebrohepatorenal syndrome).|$|E
25|$|TRAP is {{associated}} with osteoclast migration to bone resorption sites, and, once there, TRAP is believed to initiate osteoclast differentiation, activation, and proliferation. This hypothesis was formed from {{the examination of the}} bone structure of TRAP-null mice. It was noted that, in addition to <b>osteopetrosis,</b> bone formation occurred in a haphazard manner, where the microarchitecture was highly irregular.|$|E
25|$|In {{knockout}} studies, TRAP−/− mice exhibit mild <b>osteopetrosis,</b> {{associated with}} reduced osteoclast activity. These result in thickening and shortening of the cortices, formation of club-like deformities in the distal femur, and widened epiphyseal growth plates with delayed mineralization of cartilage, {{all of which}} increase with age. In TRAP overexpressing transgenic mice, mild osteoporosis occurs along with increased osteoblast activity and bone synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Other {{possible}} {{risk factors}} include periodontal disease, acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, local bone disease, Paget's disease of bone, <b>osteopetrosis,</b> cemento-osseous dysplasia, {{a history of}} previously developing a dry socket with past extractions and inadequate oral hygiene. Other factors in the postoperative period {{that may lead to}} loss of the blood clot include forceful spitting, sucking through a straw, and coughing or sneezing.|$|E
25|$|Combined dRTA and pRTA is also {{observed}} {{as the result}} of inherited carbonic anhydrase II deficiency. Mutations in the gene encoding this enzyme give rise to an autosomal recessive syndrome of <b>osteopetrosis,</b> renal tubular acidosis, cerebral calcification, and mental retardation. It is very rare and cases {{from all over the world}} have been reported, of which about 70% are from the Magreb region of North Africa, possibly due to the high prevalence of consanguinity there.|$|E
25|$|RANKL is {{a member}} of the tumour {{necrosis}} family (TNF), and is essential in osteoclastogenesis. RANKL knockout mice exhibit a phenotype of <b>osteopetrosis</b> and defects of tooth eruption, along with an absence or deficiency of osteoclasts. RANKL activates NF-κβ (nuclear factor-κβ) and NFATc1 (nuclear factor of activated t cells, cytoplasmic, calcineurin-dependent 1) through RANK. NF-κβ activation is stimulated almost immediately after RANKL-RANK interaction occurs and is not upregulated. NFATc1 stimulation, however, begins ~24–48 hours after binding occurs and its expression has been shown to be RANKL dependent.|$|E
500|$|Other pathologies {{reported}} in Allosaurus include: Willow breaks in two ribs. Healed fractures in the humerus and radius. Distortion of joint surfaces {{in the foot}} possibly due to osteoarthritis or developmental issues. <b>Osteopetrosis</b> along the endosteal surface of a tibia. Distortions of the joint surfaces of the tail vertebrae possibly due to osetoarthritis or developmental issues. [...] "xtensive 'neoplastic' ankylosis of caudals," [...] possibly due to physical trauma {{as well as the}} fusion of chevrons to centra. Coossification of vertebral centra {{near the end of the}} tail. Amputation of a chevron and foot bone, both possibly a result of bites. [...] "xtensive exostoses" [...] in the first phalanx of the third toe. Lesions similar to those caused by osteomyelitis in two scapulae. Bone spurs in a premaxilla, ungual, and two metacarpals. Exostosis in a pedal phalanx possibly attributable to an infectious disease. A metacarpal with a round depressed fracture.|$|E
2500|$|Hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} remains a dangerous procedure with many possible complications; it {{is reserved for}} patients with life-threatening diseases. As survival following the procedure has increased, its use has expanded beyond cancer to [...] autoimmune diseases and hereditary skeletal dysplasias; notably malignant infantile <b>osteopetrosis</b> and mucopolysaccharidosis.|$|E
2500|$|Achondroplasia {{is one of}} 19 {{congenital}} {{conditions with}} similar presentations, such as osteogenesis imperfecta, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia tarda, achondrogenesis, <b>osteopetrosis,</b> and [...] thanatophoric dysplasia. This makes estimates of prevalence difficult, with changing and subjective diagnostic criteria over time. One detailed and long-running study in the Netherlands found that the prevalence determined at birth was only 1.3 per 100,000 live births. Another study {{at the same time}} found a rate of 1 per 10,000.|$|E
2500|$|At age 13, Toulouse-Lautrec {{fractured}} {{his right}} femur. At age 14, he fractured his left. The breaks did not heal properly. Modern physicians attribute this to an unknown genetic disorder, possibly pycnodysostosis (sometimes known as Toulouse-Lautrec Syndrome), or a variant disorder {{along the lines}} of <b>osteopetrosis,</b> achondroplasia, or osteogenesis imperfecta. Rickets aggravated by praecox virilism has also been suggested. Afterwards, his legs ceased to grow, so that as an adult he was extremely short (...) [...] He developed an adult-sized torso, while retaining his child-sized legs. Additionally, he is reported to have had hypertrophied genitals.|$|E
2500|$|Once activated, osteoclasts move {{to areas}} of microfracture {{in the bone}} by chemotaxis. Osteoclasts lie in a small cavity called Howship's lacunae, formed from the {{digestion}} of the underlying bone. The sealing zone is the attachment of the osteoclast's plasma membrane to the underlying bone. Sealing zones are bounded by belts of specialized adhesion structures called podosomes. Attachment to the bone matrix is facilitated by integrin receptors, such as αvβ3, via the specific amino acid motif Arg-Gly-Asp in bone matrix proteins, such as osteopontin. The osteoclast releases hydrogen ions through the action of carbonic anhydrase (H2O + CO2 → HCO3− + H+) through the ruffled border into the resorptive cavity, acidifying and aiding dissolution of the mineralized bone matrix into Ca2+, H3PO4, H2CO3, water and other substances. Dysfunction of the carbonic anhydrase has been documented to cause some forms of <b>osteopetrosis.</b> [...] Hydrogen ions are pumped against a high concentration gradient by proton pumps, specifically a unique vacuolar-ATPase. This enzyme has been targeted {{in the prevention of}} osteoporosis. In addition, several hydrolytic enzymes, such as members of the cathepsin and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) groups, are released to digest the organic components of the matrix. These enzymes are released into the compartment by lysosomes. Of these hydrolytic enzymes, cathepsin K is of most importance.|$|E
50|$|<b>Osteopetrosis</b> is {{generic name}} that {{represents}} a group of heritable conditions {{in which there is}} a defect in osteoclastic bone resorption. Both dominant and recessive <b>osteopetrosis</b> occur in humans {Michigami, 2002; Frattini, 2000}. Autosomal dominant <b>osteopetrosis</b> shows mild symptoms in adults experiencing frequent bone fractures due to brittle bones {Michigami, 2002}. A more severe form of <b>osteopetrosis</b> is termed autosomal recessive infantile malignant <b>osteopetrosis</b> {Frattini, 2000; Sobacchi, 2001; Fasth, 1999}. Three genes that are responsible for recessive <b>osteopetrosis</b> in humans have been identified. They are all directly involved in the proton generation and secretion pathways that are essential for bone resorption. One gene is carbonic anhydrase II (CAII), which, when mutated, causes <b>osteopetrosis</b> with renal tubular acidosis(type 3) {Sly, 1983}. Mutations to the chloride channel ClC7 gene also lead to both dominant and recessive <b>osteopetrosis</b> {Michigami, 2002}. Approximately 50% of patients with recessive infantile malignant <b>osteopetrosis</b> have mutations to the a3 subunit isoform of V-ATPase {Sobacchi, 2001; Kornak, 2000; Frattini, 2003}. In humans, 26 mutations have been identified in V-ATPase subunit isoform a3, found in osteoclasts, that result in the bone disease autosomal recessive <b>osteopetrosis</b> {Frattini, 2000; Kornak, 2000; Sobacchi, 2001; Susani, 2004}.|$|E
50|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis of <b>osteopetrosis</b> includes other disorders that produce osteosclerosis. They constitute {{a wide array}} of disorders with clinically and radiologically diverse manifestations. Among the {{differential diagnosis}} are hereditary ostoesclerosing dysplasias such as; neuropathic infantile <b>osteopetrosis,</b> infantile <b>osteopetrosis</b> with renal tubular acidosis, infantile <b>osteopetrosis</b> with immunodeficiency, infantile <b>osteopetrosis</b> with leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome (LAD-III), pyknodysostosis (<b>osteopetrosis</b> acro-osteolytica), osteopoikilosis (Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome), osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis, mixed sclerosing skeletal dysplasias, progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (Camurati-Engelmann disease), SOST-related sclerosing skeletal dysplasias. Besides, the differential diagnosis includes acquired conditions that induce osteosclerosis such as osteosclerotic metastasis notably carcinomas of the prostate gland and breast, Paget's disease of bone, myelofibrosis (primary disorder or secondary to intoxication or malignancy), Erdheim-Chester disease, osteosclerosing types of osteomyelitis, sickle cell disease, hypervitaminosis D and hypoparathyroidism.|$|E
50|$|Hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} {{is the only}} effective line of treatment for malignant infantile <b>osteopetrosis.</b> It {{has been shown to}} provide long-term disease-free periods for a significant percentage of patients with malignant infantile <b>osteopetrosis.</b> It can impact both hematologic and skeletal abnormalities. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been used successfully to reverse the skeletal abnormalities associated with malignant infantile <b>osteopetrosis.</b> Radiographs of patients with malignant infantile <b>osteopetrosis</b> have demonstrated bone remodeling and recanalization of medullar canals following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This favorable radiographic response could be expected within one year following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Nevertheless, primary graft failure can prove fatal.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Osteopetrosis,</b> {{literally}} [...] "stone bone", {{also known}} as marble bone disease, is an extremely rare inherited disorder whereby the bones harden, becoming denser, in contrast to more prevalent conditions like osteoporosis, in which the bones become less dense and more brittle, or osteomalacia, in which the bones soften. <b>Osteopetrosis</b> can cause bones to dissolve and break.|$|E
5000|$|Malignant {{infantile}} <b>osteopetrosis</b> or (Infantile {{autosomal recessive}} <b>osteopetrosis)</b> {{is a rare}} type of skeletal dysplasia characterized by a distinct radiographic pattern of overall increased density of the bones with fundamental involvement of the medullary portion. Infantile <b>osteopetrosis</b> typically manifests in infancy. Diagnosis is principally based on clinical and radiographic evaluation, confirmed by gene analysis where applicable. [...] As a result of medullary canal obliteration and bony expansion, grave pancytopenia, cranial nerve compression, and pathologic fractures may ensue. The prognosis is poor if untreated. The classic radiographic features include, endobone or “bone-within-bone” appearance in the spine, pelvis and proximal femora, upper limbs and short tubular bones of the hand. Additionally, there is the Erlenmeyer flask deformity type 2 which is characterized by absence of normal diaphyseal metaphyseal modelling of the distal femora with abnormal radiographic appearance of trabecular bone and alternating radiolucent metaphyseal bands. The precise and early diagnosis of infantile <b>osteopetrosis</b> is important for management of complications, genetic counselling and timely institution of appropriate treatment namely hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation offers a satisfactory treatment modality for a considerable percentage of infantile <b>osteopetrosis.</b> Amelioration of radiographic bone lesions after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in infantile <b>osteopetrosis</b> have been proposed to be important indicators of success of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Few publications with limited study participants have demonstrated the resolution of skeletal radiographic pathology following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.|$|E
