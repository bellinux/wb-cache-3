5|$|A {{documentary}} film was commissioned {{to celebrate the}} 25th anniversary of Last of the Summer Wine. Produced and directed by Alan J. W. Bell, it featured interviews with the majority <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> and crew members, outtakes from the show, and a behind-the-scenes look at production. Segments with Duncan Wood and Barry Took explained {{the origins of the}} show and how it came to be filmed in Holmfirth. The documentary was broadcast on 30 March 1997.|$|E
5|$|North Parade Bridge {{was built}} almost 100 {{years later in}} 1836 by William Tierney Clark. His {{original}} bridge was made <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> iron on stone abutments, with lodges and staircases. This was rebuilt in 1936 completely in stone. Many of the buildings in South Parade are now hotels and restaurants whilst some remain as private residences. The area which Wood envisaged as an area of sunken gardens matching the houses is now a car park.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In twin-roll {{thin strip}} casting, the {{temperature}} distribution <b>of</b> <b>casting</b> roll affects the roll thermal stress, and influences the thermal deformation, {{the generation of}} roll surface cracks, the strip shape, and the service life <b>of</b> <b>casting</b> roll. In this paper, the temperature distributions <b>of</b> <b>casting</b> roll have been analysed, {{the effects of the}} roll sleeve thickness on the temperature field and thermal stress <b>of</b> <b>casting</b> roll have been simulated and discussed. The developed temperature model <b>of</b> <b>casting</b> roll is helpful in optimising the processing parameters and the design <b>of</b> <b>casting</b> roll during twin-roll thin strip casting...|$|R

40|$|In twin-roll {{strip casting}} process, the {{temperature}} variation <b>of</b> <b>casting</b> roll {{can result in}} roll thermal stress and fatigue. It not only affects the thermal deformation <b>of</b> <b>casting</b> roll and the generation of the roll surface cracks significantly, but also influences the surface quality, shape and profile of the produced strip, and the service life <b>of</b> the <b>casting</b> roll. In this paper, a 3 D coupling thermal-flow finite element modelling has been conducted. For twin-roll <b>casting</b> <b>of</b> stainless steel, the influences <b>of</b> the <b>casting</b> speed and liquid level in molten pool on the temperature field <b>of</b> <b>casting</b> roll have been simulated and discussed. The developed model is very helpful in optimising the processing parameters and the design <b>of</b> <b>casting</b> roll during twin-roll thin strip casting...|$|R
5|$|The Bill {{had a large}} regular cast {{to support}} the number of episodes that were {{produced}} each year. Working on The Bill had {{become something of a}} comical joke in British acting, with 174 actors having formed part of the series' main cast since the series began. A number <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> members have played multiple roles in the series, and in other British soap operas and dramas.|$|E
5|$|The center's design {{reflects}} {{the architecture of}} the Near East. It is constructed <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> concrete. Hand-carved Jerusalem limestone adorn the building, according to local custom. The use of arches and domes closely models other building of Jerusalem and the gardens throughout the center contain many trees and other plants named in the Bible. The interior contains the arches and cupolas typical of the Near East, and large, windowed pavilions provide wide views of Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|The shells {{are made}} <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> iron, {{as large as}} a bowl and shaped like a ball. Inside they contain half a pound of 'magic' gunpowder.

5|$|Another very ancient seat is the {{so-called}} “Chair of Dagobert” in the Louvre. It is <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> bronze, sharpened with the chisel and partially gilt; it is of the curule or faldstool type and supported upon legs terminating in the heads and feet of animals. The seat, which was probably of leather, has disappeared. Its attribution depends entirely upon the statement of Suger, abbot of St Denis in the 12th century, who added a back and arms. Its age has been much discussed, but Viollet-le-Duc dated it to early Merovingian times, and it may in any case be taken as the oldest faldstool in existence.|$|E
5|$|Commercially {{available}} iron {{is classified}} based on purity and {{the abundance of}} additives. Pig iron has 3.5–4.5% carbon and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as sulfur, silicon and phosphorus. Pig iron is not a saleable product, but rather an intermediate step in the production <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> iron and steel. The reduction of contaminants in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, yields cast iron containing 2–4% carbon, 1–6% silicon, and small amounts of manganese. Pig iron has a melting point {{in the range of}} 1420–1470K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly and depend on the form the carbon takes in the alloy.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, it was {{determined}} a new tower needed to be built and the new structure was completed in 1868. The new lighthouse was a keeper's quarters with an attached lantern on the roof. The structure is of the same design as lighthouses at Sheffield Island in Norwalk; Morgan Point in Noank; Old Field Point Light and Plum Island in New York; and Block Island North in Rhode Island. The dwelling is made of granite and the lantern made <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> iron. The original Fresnel lens was installed in the new tower. In 1890, a fog whistle was installed {{and it would be}} replaced by a siren in 1905. The siren caused much distress to nearby residents and had to be modified.|$|E

5|$|Modern deep frying {{began in}} the 19th century with the growing {{popularity}} <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> iron, particularly around the American South {{which led to the}} development of many modern deep-fried dishes. French fries, invented in the late 18th century, became popular in the early 19th century western Europe. Doughnuts were invented in the mid-19th century, with foods such as onion rings, deep-fried turkey, and corn dogs all being invented in the early 20th century. In recent years, the growth of fast food has expanded the reach of deep-fried foods, especially French fries.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Intensification <b>of</b> die <b>casting</b> <b>of</b> car silumins wheels {{with use}} of the water mist instead of {{compressed}} air dies cooling in low pressure casting process were presented in the paper. Design/methodology/approach: Examinations <b>of</b> <b>casting</b> process parameters were carried out on the industrial workstation <b>of</b> <b>casting</b> car wheels under the low pressure and also with Magma computer simulating system. Findings: The temperature {{and the range of}} its variation were presented in characteristic points <b>of</b> the <b>casting</b> and the cooled die with use the compressed air and with the water mist. A scheme of the device for generating the water mist cooling the die and also the pictures of simulation <b>of</b> wheels <b>casting</b> process for researched cooling methods was given. Research limitations/implications: The manufacturing technologies with the permanent mould. Practical implications: Using the water mist to cooling of dies in die casting and low pressure casting process to intensify of cooling the die and to reduce the amount <b>of</b> <b>casting</b> spoilage. Originality/value: Using the water mist to cooling increases intensity of cooling of the die and the cast. It makes shorter the cycle <b>of</b> <b>casting</b> process as well as reduces the porosity <b>of</b> <b>casts</b> and increases mechanical properties: Rp 0, 2, Rm, A 5 and HB...|$|R
5|$|The Jin–Song Wars were {{notable for}} the {{appearance}} of new technological innovations. The siege of De'an in 1132 included the first recorded use of the fire lance, an early gunpowder weapon and an ancestor of the firearm. The huopao, an incendiary bomb, was employed {{in a number of}} battles and gunpowder bombs made <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> iron were used in a siege in 1221. The Jurchens migrated south and settled in northern China, where they adopted the language and Confucian culture of the local inhabitants. The Jin dynasty government grew into a centralized imperial bureaucracy structured {{in the same manner as}} previous dynasties of China. Both the Song and Jin dynasties ended in the 13th century as the Mongol Empire expanded across Asia.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of Mughal-e-Azam began in 1944, when Asif read a play {{set in the}} reign of Emperor Akbar (1556–1605). Production was plagued by delays and financial uncertainty. Before its principal photography {{began in the early}} 1950s, the project had lost a financier and undergone a complete change <b>of</b> <b>cast.</b> Mughal-e-Azam cost more to produce than any previous Indian motion picture; the budget for a single song sequence exceeded that typical for an entire film of the period. The soundtrack, inspired by Indian classical and folk music, comprises 12 songs voiced by playback singers including Lata Mangeshkar and classical singer Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, and is often cited among the finest in Bollywood cinematic history.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{partially}} cast with stock actors that Corman had used in previous films. Writer Charles B. Griffith portrays several small roles. Griffith's father {{appears as a}} dental patient, and his grandmother, Myrtle Vail, appears as Seymour's hypochondriac mother. Dick Miller, who had starred as the protagonist of A Bucket of Blood was offered the role of Seymour, but turned it down, instead taking the smaller role of Burson Fouch. Production at the Bucket of Blood sets was compressed into three days <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> rehearsals, immediately followed by two days and one night of principal photography.|$|E

5|$|The {{process is}} {{versatile}} {{and can be}} performed with relatively inexpensive equipment, making it well suited to shop jobs and field work. An operator can become reasonably proficient with a modest amount of training and can achieve mastery with experience. Weld times are rather slow, since the consumable electrodes must be frequently replaced and because slag, the residue from the flux, must be chipped away after welding. Furthermore, the process is generally limited to welding ferrous materials, though special electrodes have made possible the welding <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> iron, nickel, aluminum, copper, and other metals.|$|E
5|$|The {{swing bridge}} {{spanning}} the Esk divides {{the upper and}} lower harbours and joins the east and west sides of the town. Whitby developed as an important bridging point of the River Esk and in 1351 permission was granted for tolls to be taken on the bridge for its maintenance. In 1609 a survey for a new bridge was commissioned while in 1628 it was described as a drawbridge where men raised planks to let vessels pass and tolls were collected. The bridge posts were rebuilt in stone at a cost of £3,000 in 1766. This structure was replaced by a four-arched bridge between 1833 and 1835, one arch made <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> iron swivelled to allow vessels to pass. This bridge was replaced between 1908 and 1909 by the current electric swing bridge.|$|E
