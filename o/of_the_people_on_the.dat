5|$|With {{the loss}} of Bucher and his aircraft, the C-130 Hercules had not {{completed}} a successful evacuation, and {{there were more than}} 600 people still on the ground. Next in line was Lieutenant Colonel William Boyd; he was flying an airlift mission into Chu Lai, until he was diverted into Khâm Đức to extract forces and civilians there. Just before Boyd touched down, an artillery shell exploded about 100 feet in front of his aircraft, so he was forced to pull the throttle forward. Boyd then pulled up and went around for a second approach, because he could see the desperation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. As he landed, hundreds of civilians and soldiers poured out of the ditches and rushed onto the aircraft. Because he had witnessed the destruction of Bucher's C-130 while taking off in the north direction, Boyd decided to fly out from the southwest. After Boyd's aircraft was airborne, he banked the aircraft so it would be masked by the rolling terrain. The aircraft sustained damages to the left wing, the fuselage, and the leading edge of both wings, but it landed safely in Chu Lai with all the passengers.|$|E
5|$|Kyle, Cartman and Kenny {{surprise}} Stan {{by creating}} a Facebook account for him. Stan protests, but is quickly pressured by family and friends to add them as friends. To his annoyance and frustration, Stan finds people such as Randy, his grandmother and even Wendy confronting him over his supposed disregard for them and judging his real-world friendship solely by his Facebook configuration. Meanwhile, Kyle adds shy nerdy student Kip Drordy (anagram: Dorky Drip) to his thriving friends list out of pity. Kyle's number of Facebook friends rapidly declines when he does this, {{in part due to}} a Mad Friends podcast he finds Cartman has set up in which he berates Kyle for choosing a loser as a friend and asserts nobody will want to hang out with Kyle. Kyle understands this, but, on principle and out of pity, cannot bring himself to delete Kip to please others. Desperate to stem the loss of friends, he asks Cartman for advice. Cartman introduces Kyle to Chatroulette as a way to make new friends, which fails as most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site are either jacking off or showing their genitals, until Cartman finally finds another Jewish kid named Isiah, who agrees to be Kyle's friend, much to Kyle's delight.|$|E

25|$|Travel diminished after 1860, as the Civil War caused {{considerable}} disruptions on the trail. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{trail in}} 1861–1863 were fleeing {{the war and}} its attendant drafts in both {{the south and the}} north. Trail historian Merrill J. Mattes has estimated the number of emigrants for 1861–1867 given in the total column of the above table. But these estimates may well be low since they only amount to an extra 125,000 people, and the 1870 census shows that over 200,000 additional people (ignoring most of the population increase in California, which had excellent sea and rail connections across Panama by then) showed up in all the states served by the Bozeman, California, Mormon, and Oregon Trail(s) and their offshoots.|$|E
25|$|The {{conquest of}} Cumberland was the {{beginning}} of a war between Scotland and England which saw the region centred around Carlisle change hands a number of times. It was a major stronghold after the construction of the castle. During the wars, the livelihood <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> borders was devastated by armies from both sides. Even when the countries were not at war, tension remained high, and royal authority in one or the other kingdom was often weak. The uncertainty of existence meant that communities or peoples kindred to each other sought security through their own strength and cunning, and they improved their livelihoods at their enemies' expense. These peoples were known as the Border Reivers and Carlisle was the major city within their territories.|$|E

25|$|The {{origins of}} the Scotch-Irish lie {{primarily}} in the Lowlands of Scotland and in northern England, particularly in the Border Country {{on either side of}} the Anglo-Scottish border, a region that had seen centuries of conflict. In the near constant state of war between England and Scotland during the Middle Ages, the livelihood <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> borders was devastated by the contending armies. Even when the countries were not at war, tension remained high, and royal authority in one or the other kingdom was often weak. The uncertainty of existence led the people of the borders to seek security through a system of family ties, similar to the clan system in the Scottish Highlands. Known as the Border Reivers, these families relied on their own strength and cunning to survive, and a culture of cattle raiding and thievery developed.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, a {{campaign}} called “New Name, New Flag, New Anthem” was launched to rename the Republic of China, replace {{the flag of}} the Republic of China, and the National Anthem of the Republic of China, all of which were brought to Taiwan when the Kuomintang government retreated to the island in 1949. After a contest in which 187 different flags were entered, the “hearts-in-harmony flag” emerged as the winner. The green field was to symbolize the natural beauty of the island and the need to protect the environment; the white in the Canadian pale was to symbolize the purity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island and the desire to preserve the natural beauty; and the device in the centre was to symbolize four hearts in harmony, representing the four population groups on the island: the indigenous peoples, Hakka, Hoklo, and mainlanders. This flag has emerged as the most well-known proposed flag of Taiwan, though it has not gained acceptance with the mainstream Democratic Progressive Party. Some Chinese nationalists criticized the design as being reminiscent of the Imperial Seal of Japan where a chrysanthemum is present and therefore a promotion of Japanese militarism.|$|E
25|$|Assuming {{that low}} turnout is a {{reflection}} of disenchantment or indifference, a poll with very low turnout may not be an accurate reflection of the will <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, if low turnout {{is a reflection}} of contentment of voters about likely winners or parties, then low turnout is as legitimate as high turnout, as long as the right to vote exists. Still, low turnouts can lead to unequal representation among various parts of the population. In developed countries, non-voters tend to be concentrated in particular demographic and socioeconomic groups, especially the young and the poor. However, in India, which boasts an electorate of more than 814 million people, the opposite is true. The poor, who comprise the majority of the demographic, are more likely to vote than the rich and the middle classes, and turnout is higher in rural areas than urban areas. In low-turnout countries, these groups are often significantly under-represented in elections. This has the potential to skew policy. For instance, a high voter turnout among the elderly coupled with a low turnout among the young may lead to more money for retirees' health care, and less for youth employment schemes. Some nations thus have rules that render an election invalid if too few people vote, such as Serbia, where three successive presidential elections were rendered invalid in 2003.|$|E

25|$|Lu Xun (183 – March or April 245), {{courtesy}} name Boyan, {{also sometimes}} referred to as Lu Yi, was a military general and statesman of the state of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period. He started his career as an official under the warlord Sun Quan in the 200s CE during the late Eastern Han dynasty and steadily rising through the ranks. In 219, he assisted Sun Quan's general Lü Meng in an invasion of Jing Province, which led to the defeat and death of Liu Bei's general Guan Yu. In 222, he served as the field commander of the Wu army in the Battle of Xiaoting against Liu Bei's forces and scored a decisive victory over the enemy. Lu Xun reached the pinnacle of his career after this battle as Sun Quan regarded him more highly, promoted him to higher positions and bestowed upon him unprecedented honours. Throughout the middle and the later parts of his career, Lu Xun oversaw and managed both civil and military affairs in Wu while participating in some battles against Wu's rival state, Wei, from time to time. In his final years, Lu Xun was drawn into a succession struggle between Sun Quan's sons and fell out of Sun Quan's favour as a consequence. He managed to retain his appointment as Imperial Chancellor – an office he assumed in 244 – but died a year later in frustration. Lu Xun's role in the Wu government was likened to that of a custos morum as he believed firmly in and upheld Confucian principles and practices. On the one hand, he provided constant and timely advice to Sun Quan to exercise benevolence and consider the welfare <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, he vehemently objected to Sun Quan's idea of replacing his legitimate heir apparent in favour of a younger son.|$|E

500|$|Steven Biel, an American {{cultural}} historian, {{notes the}} novelistic {{way in which}} Lord tells the story.

Nathaniel Philbrick, writing in the introduction to the fiftieth anniversary edition of A Night to Remember, notes {{that at the time of}} publication it was the first significant book about Titanic for nearly forty years. He argues that the book's hallmarks are its restraint, brevity and readability, which downplays the extravagant and mythical aspects of the disaster and instead puts in the foreground the stories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ship. The narrative builds suspense, making the reader care about the characters and revisit the disaster from their perspective. It tells the story in a highly visual and aural way, describing the sights and sounds of the night of the disaster [...] "with the immediacy of a live broadcast or a television documentary", as Biel puts it.|$|E

500|$|For Sony's OVAs of the franchise, {{there have}} also been {{multiple}} response. Matthew Anderson from DVD Vision Japan found the series' title [...] "Samurai X" [...] unfitting for Kenshin as the reviewer regarded the character as a hired killer rather than as a samurai as seen across the prequel OVAs. Rio Yañez from Animerica said one of the major themes of Trust is understanding the repercussions and after-effects murder can have, something that Kenshin has yet to comprehend though others have tried to point it out to him. Mike Crando from Anime News Network highly enjoyed Kenshin's characterization in the prequel as he refers it as [...] "it is a fascinating and emotional character study in its own right" [...] due to Kenshin's character development across these four episodes from [...] "an idealistic youth to a cold-hearted killer, only to be redeemed through love lost and the realization that swinging his sword is destroying his own life as well as the lives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> receiving end". Additionally, the reviewer enjoyed the OVA's director's cut for showing more fights between Kenshin and Shinsenguimi, the special forces where Saito originated from. Earl Cressey from DVD Talk found Kenshin as a [...] "complex" [...] character and said his relationship with Yukishiro Tomoe might appeal the viewers. Carlos Ross from THEM Anime Reviews shared similar feelings and enjoyed the romance between Kenshin Tomoe despite its tragic outcome. Yegulalp from ThoughtCo. also listed the series as one of the [...] "Best anime romances" [...] with a bigger focus on Kenshin and Tomoe.|$|E
500|$|Goebbels became {{preoccupied with}} morale {{and the efforts}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> home front. He {{believed}} that the more the people at home {{were involved in the}} war effort, the better their morale would be. For example, he initiated a programme for the collection of winter clothing and ski equipment for troops on the eastern front. At the same time, Goebbels implemented changes to have more [...] "entertaining material" [...] in radio and film produced for the public, decreeing in late 1942 that 20 per cent of the films should be propaganda and 80 per cent light entertainment. As Gauleiter of Berlin, Goebbels dealt with increasingly serious shortages of necessities such as food and clothing, as well as the need to ration beer and tobacco, which were important for morale. Hitler suggested watering the beer and degrading the quality of the cigarettes so that more could be produced, but Goebbels refused, saying the cigarettes were already of such low quality {{that it was impossible to}} make them any worse. Through his propaganda campaigns, he worked hard to maintain an appropriate level of morale among the public about the military situation, neither too optimistic nor too grim. The series of military setbacks the Germans suffered in this period – the thousand-bomber raid on Cologne (May 1942), the Allied victory at the Second Battle of El Alamein (November 1942), and especially the catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad (February 1943) – were difficult matters to present to the German public, who were increasingly weary of the war and skeptical that it could be won. On 15 January 1943, Hitler appointed Goebbels as head of the newly created Air Raid Damage committee, which meant Goebbels was nominally in charge of nationwide civil air defenses and shelters as well as the assessment and repair of damaged buildings. In actuality, the defence of areas other than Berlin remained in the hands of the local Gauleiters, and his main tasks were limited to providing immediate aid to the affected civilians and using propaganda to improve their morale.|$|E
