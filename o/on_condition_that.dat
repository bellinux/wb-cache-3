5|$|Despite his {{disapproval of}} the union, Venizelos allowed Aspasia {{and her mother}} {{to move into the}} Royal Palace <b>on</b> <b>condition</b> <b>that</b> the {{marriage}} remain secret. The information leaked, however, and to escape public opprobrium Aspasia was forced to leave Greece. She fled to Rome, and then to Paris, where Alexander was allowed to join her, six months later, <b>on</b> <b>condition</b> <b>that</b> they did not attend official functions together. On their Parisian honeymoon, while motoring near Fontainebleau, the couple witnessed a serious car crash in which Count Kergariou's chauffeur lost control of his master's vehicle. Alexander avoided the count's car, which swerved and hit a tree. The king drove the injured to hospital in his own car, while Aspasia, who had trained as a nurse during World War I, rendered first aid. The count was seriously injured and died shortly afterward, after having both legs amputated.|$|E

5|$|Before Tiberius, {{the heirs}} of Augustus were {{the sons of}} Marcus Agrippa, Gaius and Lucius Caesar, whom he adopted and made heir.

In AD 4, Augustus adopted Tiberius <b>on</b> <b>condition</b> <b>that</b> Tiberius adopt Germanicus. This made Tiberius the heir of Augustus, and Germanicus the heir of Tiberius.
