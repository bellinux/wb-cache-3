5|$|Although Casablanca was an A-list {{film with}} {{established}} stars and first-rate writers, no one involved with its production {{expected it to}} be anything out of the ordinary. It was just <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>hundreds</b> of pictures produced by Hollywood every year. Casablanca was rushed into release {{to take advantage of the}} publicity from the Allied invasion of North Africa a few weeks earlier. It had its world premiere on November 26, 1942, in New York City and was released nationally in the United States on January 23, 1943. The film was a solid if unspectacular success in its initial run.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Ferraro co-founded the National Organization of Italian American Women, {{which sought}} to support the {{educational}} and professional goals of its members and put forward positive role models in order to fight ethnic stereotyping, and was still a distinguished member of its board {{at the time of}} her death. Ferraro was connected with many other political and non-profit organizations. She was a board member of the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. She became president of the newly established International Institute for Women's Political Leadership in 1989. In 1992, she was on the founding board of Project Vote Smart. By 1993, she was serving on the Fordham Law School Board of Visitors, as well as on the boards of the National Breast Cancer Research Fund, the New York Easter Seal Society, and the Pension Rights Center, and was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>hundreds</b> of public figures on the Planned Parenthood Federation of America's Board of Advocates.

Initially, the plan was derailed when authorities were alerted to Al-Jihad's plan by the arrest of an operative carrying crucial information, in February 1981. President Sadat ordered the roundup of more than 1500 people, including many Al-Jihad members, but missed a cell in the military led by Lieutenant Khalid Islambouli, who succeeded in assassinating Sadat during a military parade that October. His lawyer, Montasser el-Zayat, said that Zawahiri was tortured in prison.|$|E

25|$|While {{there have}} been no {{detailed}} studies of desomorphine in its pure form publicly available, it is highly likely that it is not causing the severe inflammation, necrosis, and flesh-eating symptoms of krokodil. Such damages {{are much more likely to}} be related to the toxic chemicals used in the crude at-home synthesis than to desomorphine itself. There is no indication that desomorphine - <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>hundreds</b> of known opioids which differ primarily in strength and duration of action - has any unique 'qualities' which would make it desirable to opiate users in its pure form, nor that in pure form desomorphine would cause the symptoms associated with krokodil.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, piracy along the East and Gulf Coasts of North America {{as well as}} in the Caribbean {{increased}} again. Jean Lafitte was just <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>hundreds</b> of pirates operating in American and Caribbean waters between the years of 1820 and 1835. The United States Navy repeatedly engaged pirates in the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and in the Mediterranean. Cofresí's El Mosquito was disabled in a collaboration between Spain and the United States. After fleeing for hours, he was ambushed and captured inland. The United States landed shore parties on several islands in the Caribbean in pursuit of pirates; Cuba was a major haven. By the 1830s piracy had died out again, and the navies of the region focused on the slave trade.|$|E
25|$|More {{research}} is needed to fully define whether krokodil is a drug or a collection of symptoms associated with injecting toxic chemical by-products of home drug chemistry, but since desomorphine is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>hundreds</b> of known opiates in a chemical family with no association to the symptoms, it is much more likely that the drug is a set of symptoms associated with the injection of household chemicals, rather than a specific drug itself. A comparison could be made to the effects of methanol poisoning from illicitly produced alcohol during the U.S. prohibition. Methanol was sometimes added to the distillate to enhance profits. Similarly, it is likely that krokodil is not a drug in itself, but rather, the symptoms of injecting toxic chemicals used in the process and not removed due to the crude process and lack of testing equipment.|$|E
500|$|Mephedrone is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>hundreds</b> of {{designer}} drugs or legal highs {{that have been}} reported in recent years, including artificial chemicals such as synthetic cannabis and semisynthetic substances such as methylhexanamine. These drugs are primarily developed to avoid being controlled by laws against illegal drugs, thus giving them the label {{of designer}} drugs. According to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, the synthesis of mephedrone was first reported in 1929 by Saem de Burnaga Sanchez in the Bulletin de la Société Chimique de France, under the name [...] "toluyl-alpha-monomethylaminoethylcetone", but the compound remained an obscure product of academia until 2003, when it was [...] "re-discovered" [...] and publicised by an underground chemist on The Hive website, working under the pseudonym [...] "Kinetic". Kinetic posted on the site, [...] "I’ve been bored {{over the last couple of}} days and had a few fun reagents lying around, so I thought I’d try and make some 1-(4-methylphenyl)-2-methylaminopropanone hydrochloride, or 4-methylmethcathinone." [...] before going on to describe that after taking it, the user had a [...] "fantastic sense of well-being that I haven’t got from any drug before except my beloved Ecstasy." [...] In interviews Kinetic was described as [...] "a mathematician who used to design sleeping pills for a major pharmaceutical company" [...] and he stated that he was based in Israel when he rediscovered mephedrone.|$|E
