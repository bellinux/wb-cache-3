25|$|Prior to the 15th century, {{some use}} of glans condoms (devices {{covering}} only {{the head of}} the penis) is recorded in Asia. Glans condoms seem to have been used for birth control, and to have been known only by members of the upper classes. In China, glans condoms may have been made of <b>oiled</b> <b>silk</b> paper, or of lamb intestines. In Japan, they were made of tortoise shell or animal horn.|$|E
25|$|The first common {{application}} of wet aluminum electrolytic capacitors was in large telephone exchanges, to reduce relay hash (noise) on the 48 volt DC power supply. The development of AC-operated domestic radio receivers {{in the late}} 1920s created a demand for large-capacitance (for the time) and high-voltage capacitors for the valve amplifier technique, typically at least 4 microfarads and rated at around 500 volts DC. Waxed paper and <b>oiled</b> <b>silk</b> film capacitors were available, but devices with that order of capacitance and voltage rating were bulky and prohibitively expensive.|$|E
25|$|Many {{sellers of}} {{religious}} goods, named Paternostrari or Coronari (rosary makers) had their shops here. At {{the edge of}} the quarter, in Vicolo degli ombrellari, a small lane near Borgo Pio, were the shops of the Roman umbrella makers, gathered there because of the bad smell coming from the <b>oiled</b> <b>silk.</b> In Borgo Vecchio several small foundries were active, where artistic objects made of bronze were cast. Particularly characteristic was the making of bells: the last foundry, located in Vicolo del Farinone, closed around 1995, after an activity lasted about 450 years. In the Borgo were also located many famous osterie, where Romans and pilgrims could eat and drink wine.|$|E

2500|$|According to one account, John Parke Custis {{served on}} George Washington's staff during the Siege of Boston in 1775-1776 {{and became an}} {{emissary}} to the British forces there. He befriended a young British officer {{on the staff of}} General William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe. [...] While in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the officer gave Custis a weeping willow (Salix babylonica) twig that the officer had taken from a famous tree that Alexander Pope had planted at Twickenham and that was first of its kind in England. The officer had intended to plant his willow sprig wrapped in <b>oiled</b> <b>silk</b> along a stream on land he would seize from the Americans. [...] However, following his army's defeat, he decided to give the sprig to Custis. Custis then planted the twig at Abingdon. [...] The resulting tree reportedly became the parent of all of the weeping willows in the United States {{at the time of the}} account (1881).|$|E

The city also has plants that assemble automobiles and trucks. Difficulties in the proximity of some of these varied business have been encountered in the past, such as the 2008 Istanbul fireworks explosion which was exacerbated by the close proximity of a paint factory.|$|R

60|$|Had it been my affair, I believe I {{should have}} obeyed a ridiculous impulse and begged {{them to keep}} it for their trouble; so weary was I of the machine. Byfield, however, {{directed}} them to slit a seam of the <b>oiled</b> <b>silk</b> and cut away the car, which was by this time wholly submerged {{and not to be}} lifted. At once the Lunardi collapsed and became manageable; and having roped it to a ring-bolt astern, the crew fell to their oars.|$|E
60|$|The {{life-preserver}} was {{a circular}} one, filled with air. In {{the centre of}} this, Mary, by means of many strings, had probably secured a stick in an upright position; she had then fastened a handkerchief {{to the top of}} the stick.

60|$|I {{then made}} a little roll of my letters, wrapped them in <b>oiled</b> <b>silk,</b> bound them with twine, and, having {{put them in the}} bottle, got the old Jew broker to stopper, seal, and make it air-tight. While obeying my directions, he glanced at me now and then suspiciously from under his frost-white eyelashes. I believe he thought there was some evil deed on hand. In all this I had a dreary something--not pleasure--but a sad, lonely satisfaction. The impulse under which I acted, the mood {{controlling}} me, were similar to the impulse and the mood which had induced me to visit the confessional. With quick walking I regained the pensionnat just at dark, and in time for dinner.|$|E
60|$|He {{was perhaps}} ten {{feet above the}} people {{when he made his}} decision. His {{paralysis}} ceased. He leapt up on the seat, and, at imminent risk of falling headlong, released the grapnel-rope from the toggle that held it, sprang on to the trail rope and disengaged that also. A hoarse shout of disgust greeted the descent of the grapnel-rope and the swift leap of the balloon, and something--he fancied afterwards it was a turnip--whizzed by his head. The trail-rope followed its fellow. The crowd seemed to jump away from him. With an immense and horrifying rustle the balloon brushed against a telephone pole, and for a tense instant he anticipated either an electric explosion or a bursting of the <b>oiled</b> <b>silk,</b> or both. But fortune was with him.|$|E
60|$|I {{can only}} say that on {{arriving}} at a village belonging to a remote tribe of Indians, who were well-known to my guide, it was arranged that Big Otter and Waboose should stay with them, while I should go to the cities of the pale-faces and endeavour to convert my diamonds into cash. Happening to have a friend in Chicago I went there, and through his agency effected the sale of the diamonds, which produced a little over the sum mentioned by William Liston in his paper. This I took with me in the convenient form of bills on well-known mercantile firms, in the region to which I was bound, and, having wrapped them in a piece of <b>oiled</b> <b>silk</b> and sewed them inside of the breastplate that contained my gold, I set off with a light heart, though somewhat weighted shoulders, to return to my friends in the Far West.|$|E
50|$|In 1942 a {{rationing}} {{system was}} begun to guarantee minimum amounts of necessities to everyone (especially poor people) and prevent inflation. Tires {{were the first}} item to be rationed in January 1942 because supplies of natural rubber were interrupted. Gasoline rationing proved an even better way to allocate scarce rubber. By 1943 one needed government issued ration coupons to purchase typewriters, sugar, gasoline, bicycles, footwear, fuel <b>oil,</b> <b>silk,</b> nylon, coffee, stoves, shoes, meat, cheese, butter, margarine, canned foods, dried fruits, jam, and many other items. Some items—like new automobiles and appliances—were no longer made. The rationing system {{did not apply to}} used goods (like clothes or cars). The ration system was complex and confusing, but high levels of patriotism made it acceptable as people helped each other through the maze of rules.|$|R
60|$|Next day we {{went down}} to the harbour, where the sailors of all nations were {{discharging}} and taking in cargoes of all kinds: fruits, wines, <b>oils,</b> <b>silks,</b> stuffs, velvets, and every manner of merchandise. Taking one of a great number of lively little boats with gay-striped awnings, we rowed away, under the sterns of great ships, under tow-ropes and cables, against and among other boats, and very much too near the sides of vessels that were faint with oranges, to the Marie Antoinette, a handsome steamer bound for Genoa, lying near the mouth of the harbour. By-and-by, the carriage, that unwieldy 'trifle from the Pantechnicon,' on a flat barge, bumping against everything, and giving occasion for a prodigious quantity of oaths and grimaces, came stupidly alongside; and by five o'clock we were steaming out in the open sea. The vessel was beautifully clean; the meals were served under an awning on deck; the night was calm and clear; the quiet beauty of the sea and sky unspeakable.|$|R
50|$|Achaea {{was rather}} small, {{consisting}} of the Peloponnese peninsula (then known as the Morea), but it was fairly wealthy, exporting wine, raisins, wax, honey, <b>oil</b> and <b>silk.</b> The capital of the principality was originally at Andravida.

60|$|The voice {{belonged to}} the gentleman Miss Blank had never seen before. He straddled his long legs on the hearthrug. Jermyn, leaning forward, held his pocket-handkerchief spread out before the grate. He looked back dismally over his shoulder, and as I slipped {{behind one of the}} little wooden tables, I nodded to him. On {{the other side of the}} fire, imposingly calm and large, sat Mr. Stonor, jammed tight into a capacious Windsor armchair. There was nothing small about him but his short, white side-whiskers. Yards and yards of extra superfine blue cloth (made up into an overcoat) reposed on a chair by his side. And he must just have brought some liner from sea, because another chair was smothered under his black waterproof, ample as a pall, and made of {{three-fold}} <b>oiled</b> <b>silk,</b> double-stitched throughout.

6000|$|I say [...] "soused": for I {{confess that}} the shock belied {{the promise of}} our easy descent. The Lunardi floated: but it also drove before the wind. And as it dragged the car after it like a tilted pail, the four drenched and blinded aëronauts {{struggled}} through the spray and gripped the hoop, the netting--nay, dug their nails into the <b>oiled</b> <b>silk.</b> In its new element the machine became inspired with a sudden infernal malice. It sank like a pillow if we tried to climb it: it rolled us over in the brine; it allowed us no moment for a backward glance. I spied a small cutter-rigged craft tacking towards us, a mile and more to leeward, and wondered if {{the captain of the}} brig had left our rescue to it. He had not. I heard a shout behind us; a rattle of oars as the bowmen shipped them; and a hand gripped my collar. So one by one we were plucked--uncommon specimens!--from the deep; rescued from what Mr. Sheepshanks a minute later, as he sat on a thwart and wiped his spectacles, justly termed [...] "a predicament, sir, as disconcerting as any my experience supplies." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{seized the}} time between tea and dinner {{to return to the}} library. For an hour he dug into the spongy soil of metaphysics, and it {{happened}} that he fell at last upon the Crookes and Zöllner experiments (quoted at greater length in a volume of collected experience) and found there clear and direct testimony as to the mind's mastery of matter. There was abundant evidence of the handling of fire by the medium Home, and Slade's ability to float in the air was attested by well-known witnesses, but beyond this and closer to his own day, he came upon a detailed study of an Italian psychic with her [...] "supernumerary hands," [...] a story which should have made the materialization of a letter seem very simple. But it did not. All the testimony of these great men, abundant as it was, slid from his mind as harmlessly as water from <b>oiled</b> <b>silk.</b> Apparently, it failed to alter the texture of his thought in the slightest degree. His world was the world of youth, the good old wholesome, stable world, and he refused to be convinced.|$|E
