500|$|Nixon speechwriter William Safire {{had been}} told of the sign by a friend of Nixon, Richard Moore, who left the train at {{campaign}} stops to mingle with the crowd and seek items of local color for the speechwriters to use. Safire stated in his book on {{the early days of}} the Nixon administration (originally published in 1975) that at Deshler, [...] "Moore boarded the train with that mystic look that a writer gets when he has something delicious to work with, some piece of color that could be more than a gimmick." [...] According to Safire in a 2007 column, Moore stuck his head into the compartment occupied by Nixon's speechwriters and stated, [...] "There's a little kid <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hand-lettered sign that I think says 'Bring Us Together'." [...] Safire wrote in that column that he inserted the phrase into Nixon's remarks for the speech to be given at the next stop.|$|E

5000|$|..... I went to Woodstock as {{a member}} of the audience. I did not show up <b>there</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> road manager and a couple of guitars. I showed up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> change of clothes and a toothbrush. It just so {{happened}} that because most of my friends were musicians I ended up backstage. August 16, the second day of the festival, following a rainstorm the stage had filled up with water and it was impossible to put electric instruments onstage. At that time master of ceremonies Chip Monck said to me [...] "Look, we need somebody who can go <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> acoustic guitar and hold audience while we go out and sweep the water off the stage and let it dry up and you're elected." [...] So, I had to run and borrow a guitar from Timmy Hardin and go on … it was not anything I had planned for. It was just one of those nice accidents and it resulted in my career then taking another step forward. Now, I was the Summer Concert Guy. I played every summer concert there was.|$|R

50|$|Feeling Sexy is a 1999 Australian short feature from artist Davida Allen. Allen later {{described}} the film as:A lovely plum pudding story.

There's hope and, as a Catholic, I feel that there is hope and I want to tell stories that say there is hope. It's a love story unlike the Hollywood stories which say move on; it's not working here so move on. Feeling Sexy is not a kind of Bible story that says, 'Drat it, {{this is going to be}} hard work'. It's just a different angle at looking at a universal situation. It's a celebration of monogamy. It's very similar to a seed which, unless it's watered, dies.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges inherent in any distance education environment is the development of a support infrastructure that offers sustained, high quality support to all members of the distributed community. LEEP (Library Education Experimental Program) students receive extensive support from staff and other students via e-mail, Web boards, and phone conversations. Students and alumni cite this support as something that sets the program apart from others, making it valuable not only for the technical help offered but also for moral support so students do not feel that they are <b>out</b> <b>there</b> alone <b>with</b> <b>a</b> problem (Kazmer, 2000). The extensive personalized support is crucial. Although students use a standard set of LEEP technologies and are required to conform to some hardware and software standards, the problem of technical support is complicated by all the factors that neither students nor technology people can access, much less control. Students doing coursework from home often share their computers with others and rely on Internet service providers of variable quality; others do all or some of their class work at a workplace where they depend on internal networks and gateways to reach the Internet. We would like to use this chapter to highlight some of the technological challenges...|$|R

60|$|One of the {{new friends}} who went <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> me was <b>a</b> large man, and I had been admiring his size all the way. I was still admiring it as he stood by the {{governor}} on the veranda, talking; then the Fijian butler stepped <b>out</b> <b>there</b> to announce tea, and dwarfed him. Maybe he did not quite dwarf him, but at any rate the contrast was quite striking. Perhaps that dark giant was a king in a condition of political suspension. I {{think that in the}} talk there on the veranda it was said that in Fiji, as in the Sandwich Islands, native kings and chiefs are of much grander size and build than the commoners. This man was clothed in flowing white vestments, and they were just the thing for him; they comported well with his great stature and his kingly port and dignity. European clothes would have degraded him and made him commonplace. I know that, because they do that with everybody that wears them.|$|R
5000|$|The episode {{features}} Jon Hamm, Oona Chaplin, and Rafe Spall in {{the main}} roles. Hamm later elaborated that he [...] "had {{been a fan of}} Black Mirror and Charlie Brooker, because I have a strange predilection for offbeat British things, and this was no exception. It came about in this very odd way, with me asking my agent if I could meet Mr. Brooker. I didn't know he was even working on a third series or a Christmas special or anything, it was simply that I really liked his work and really wanted to meet the guy." [...] Hamm mentioned that he had [...] "seen both previous series and absolutely loved it", and Brooker described Hamm's casting as [...] "fortuitous". In contrast to Hamm, Spall accepted a part in the episode without having seen the series, but having once read a script for a previous episode. Chaplin, who had just moved from the UK to Los Angeles to capitalise on her success in Game of Thrones, similarly praised the script, stating that she [...] "flew <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> plan to stay for a year, and then a week later I was coming back to the UK to do this.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Starborough {{was sent}} to France for his next race, the Group One Prix Jean Prat over 1800 metres at Chantilly Racecourse on 1 June. He started the 2/1 second {{favourite}} behind the Andre Fabre-trained Kirkwall, {{the winner of the}} Prix de Guiche, with the other three runners being Visionary (Prix Matchem, third in the Poule d'Essai des Poulains) Cirino and Mamalik. Ridden for the first time by Frankie Dettori, he led from the start and was driven out to win by one and a half lengths from Mamalik with Kirkwall a short head away in third. Two weeks later the colt was brought back in distance for the 152nd running of the St James's Palace Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot, and was again partnered by Dettori. Desert King started favourite ahead of Daylami and Poteen, with Starborough next in the betting on 11/2. The other runners included Mamalik, Air Express (Premio Parioli, Mehl-Mülhens-Rennen), In Command (Dewhurst Stakes) and Running Stag (runner-up in the Predominate Stakes). Starborough took the lead from the start as usual and set a strong pace from Mamalik and Running Stag. He maintained his advantage into the straight and held off a challenge from Air Express to win by a length, with Daylami four lengths back in third ahead of Desert King. After the race Dettori said [...] "He has got a very high cruising speed and there were some horses <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> greater turn of foot so I wanted to take the sting out of them", whilst Loder commented [...] "we decided to just let him roll and, as you can see, when he gets going he's got a pretty ferocious roll".|$|E
5000|$|If {{you live}} in New York, {{there are things that}} are going on all the time. I would never make light of the tragedy of 9/11, but 9/11 {{affected}} different neighborhoods in very different ways. They were all aware that this had happened, but the further down you got towards that area, the more affected you were by it. So we started with that sort of idea, that if the sky opened up and Chitauri were raining down with giant whales, and the Hulk and the Avengers were there to save the day, that's really exciting, but how did that affect the people who were six blocks over and three avenues down? That's the richness of the Marvel Universe. You can have that sort of thing happen and refer to it, but not have it be - we're not the world of the comics where you look up in the sky and Thor flies by all the time. This is a world where people do refer to Tony Stark as a billionaire in a tin suit, or the idea that they think there's a Thor <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> magic hammer. But the truth of the matter is, 'I've never seen him. Have you ever seen him?' It's that kind of world that we exist in. For us, it makes Marvel what Marvel has always been, which is grounded. Jeph Loeb on the opportunities that Daredevil existing within the Marvel Cinematic Universe presents. Daredevil is the first of the ordered Netflix series, and is followed by Marvel's Jessica Jones, Marvel's Luke Cage, and Marvel's Iron Fist, which lead to the miniseries, Marvel's The Defenders. In November 2013, Disney CEO Bob Iger stated that, if the characters prove popular on Netflix, [...] "It's quite possible that they could become feature films," [...] which Sarandos echoed in July 2015. In August 2014, D'Onofrio stated that after the [...] "series stuff with Netflix", Marvel has [...] "a bigger plan to branch out". In December 2014, Loeb explained that [...] "Within the Marvel universe there are thousands of heroes of all shapes and sizes, but the Avengers are here to save the universe and Daredevil is here to save the neighborhood ... It does take place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's all connected. But that doesn't necessarily mean that we would look up in the sky and see Man. It's just a different part of New York that we have not yet seen in the Marvel movies." [...] Dawson later elaborated that [...] "When you've got that level of superpowers, the fighting is different, the stakes are different, and it has a grander feel. In that world, they exist in it, so they know it and it's normal to them. But in reality when people are fighting and doing really bad, elicit sic crimes on the ground and there are guns and drugs—bones are going to break. People aren't hitting each other and nothing's going to happen because they're indestructible. These are people. They're vulnerable and you get to experience that." ...|$|E

[...] She {{smiled at me}} while I flushed <b>with</b> disappointment, <b>a</b> vision of fresh delay that made me at first unconscious of my surprise. It seemed more than a hint that on me as well he would impose some tiresome condition. Suddenly, while she reported several more things from his letter, I remembered what {{he had told me}} before going away. He had found Mr. Vereker deliriously interesting and his own possession of the secret a real intoxication. The buried treasure was all gold and gems. Now that it was there it seemed to grow and grow before him; it would have been, through all time and taking all tongues, one of the most wonderful flowers of literary art. Nothing, in especial, once you were face to face with it, could show for more consummately DONE. When once it came out it came <b>out,</b> was <b>there</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> splendour that made you ashamed; and there hadn't been, save in the bottomless vulgarity of the age, with every one tasteless and tainted, every sense stopped, the smallest reason why it should have been overlooked. It was great, yet so simple, was simple, yet so great, and the final knowledge of it was an experience quite apart. He intimated that the charm of such an experience, the desire to drain it, in its freshness, to the last drop, was what kept him there close to the source. Gwendolen, frankly radiant as she tossed me these fragments, showed the elation of a prospect more assured than my own. That brought me back to the question of her marriage, prompted me to ask if what she meant by what she had just surprised me with was that she was under an engagement.|$|R
5000|$|Ken Rolston {{reviewed}} Legions of Thyatis for Dragon magazine #171 (July 1991). He reviewed Arena of Thyatis and Legions of Thyatis together, {{and called}} them [...] "two ambitious and original approaches to low-level D&D adventures", noting gladiators as the theme, and calling the setting [...] "a D&D-game version of ancient Rome". [...] He praised the [...] "open-ended, improvisational role-playing", noting that [...] "the DM is <b>out</b> <b>there</b> all alone <b>with</b> <b>a</b> package of loosely linked episodes, lots of strong NPCs, and myriad plot threads {{blowing in the}} wind" [...] without any [...] "hackneyed, predictable plot elements". He did, however, feel that this adventure might not be suitable for most first D&D campaigns, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> first-time DM simultaneously trying to master the mechanics and rhythm of refereeing an FRPG and the subtle dramatic and manipulative techniques of open-ended scenario presentation. He recalled that the module Treasure Hunt, [...] "a much more linear and predictable scenario than these two adventures" [...] has a two-page appendix entitled [...] "If Things Go Wrong", and felt that sort of commentary and advice {{would be even more}} critical in open-ended settings like Arena of Thyatis and Legions of Thyatis. He felt that [...] "the ancient Roman city" [...] of Thyatis [...] "doesn't mix comfortably with heroic, D&D-game, action-adventure role-playing", and noted that the impact of spell-casters doesn't seem to have been considered. Rolston concluded the review by stating: [...] "My first response was impatient and unforgiving; only my persistence in trying to appreciate Nephew's good intentions gave me a reserved affection for the most appealing features of these modules. Give them a split grade: four stars for originality, charm, role-playing potential, and right-mindedness, and two stars for quality of DM staging, plot support, and suitability for D&D-game-style play. I do not recommend them for beginning DMs, but as an earnest and moderately successful approach to designing a module for open-ended, improvisational role-playing for the D&D game, they may inspire you to experiment with this difficult but rewarding style of FRPG adventure." ...|$|R
