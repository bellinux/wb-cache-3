5|$|When {{referring}} to the language, the name is normally capitalized (Perl) as a proper noun. When {{referring to}} the interpreter program itself, the name is often uncapitalized (perl) because most Unix-like file systems are case-sensitive. Before {{the release of the}} first edition of Programming Perl, it was common to refer to the language as perl; Randal L. Schwartz, however, capitalized the language's name in the book to make it stand <b>out</b> <b>better</b> when typeset. This case distinction was subsequently documented as canonical.|$|E
5|$|Longfellow {{moved to}} Cambridge {{to take a}} job at Harvard College as Smith Professor of Modern Languages and of Belles Lettres. A friend, Cornelius Conway Felton, {{recommended}} that Longfellow rent a room {{on the third floor of}} the home of a Professor Stearns on Kirkland Street; Longfellow stayed there for the 1836–1837 academic year. He disliked the place, however, and sought <b>out</b> <b>better</b> accommodations. Beginning in the summer of 1837, he rented rooms on the east side of the second floor of the home on Brattle Street, now owned by Elizabeth Craigie. At first, Mrs. Craigie thought he was a student at Harvard and refused to rent to him until he convinced her that he was a professor as well as the author of the book she was reading, Outre-Mer.|$|E

I just flew up there to New York, went in the studio with her. I flew right out and went back on the road. When I do a song with people, I like to really get in the studio with them so I could feel they swag and they could feel mine. The music comes <b>out</b> <b>better.</b>|$|E

25|$|Torishima {{convinced}} Toriyama to make Arale {{the main}} character of Dr. Slump instead of Senbei Norimaki, which the author agrees turned <b>out</b> <b>better.</b> Toriyama stated that Torishima enjoys romance and that the relationships of Arale and Obotchaman, Akane and Tsukutsun, and Taro and Tsururin in Dr. Slump were all his ideas. He also stated that when starting Dragon Ball, Torishima had wanted Goku and Bulma to form a relationship. Toriyama also created the Dragon Ball character Cell after Torishima, no longer his editor, was disappointed with Androids 19 and 20, and later Androids 17 and 18, as villains. Masakazu Katsura credits Torishima with coming up with ideas for Video Girl Ai.|$|E
25|$|In Visual Studio 2012 RC, a {{major change}} to the {{interface}} {{is the use of}} all-caps menu bar, as part of the campaign to keep Visual Studio consistent with the direction of other Microsoft user interfaces, and to provide added structure to the top menu bar area. The redesign was criticized for being hard to read, and going against the trends started by developers to use CamelCase to make words stand <b>out</b> <b>better.</b> Some speculated that the root cause of the redesign was to incorporate the simplistic look and feel of Metro apps. However, there exists a Windows Registry option to allow users to disable the all-caps interface.|$|E

25|$|With few impediments, {{the flow}} of Cuban and Spanish workers and their {{families}} {{back and forth between}} Florida and Cuba was both substantial and largely undocumented. Despite V.M. Ybor's efforts to anchor his employees in Tampa through home ownership, many Ybor City cigar workers were still open to heading back to Cuba to seek <b>out</b> <b>better</b> wages and conditions into the 1890s. Due to this divided national loyalty, it would be years before many of the early residents of Ybor City became American citizens, and many never saw reason to apply at all. In the largely insular community, immigrants could live surrounded by their own culture, so attachment to their countries of origin remained high, especially in the first generation.|$|E

500|$|The {{separation}} of the characters into different teams was intended to give each group a specific flavor. Kishimoto wished for each team member to be [...] "extreme", having a high amount of aptitude in one given attribute, yet talentless in another. This approach was used to make each team perform best when individual members worked together to overcome their weaknesses. Having watched tokusatsu dramas as a child, Kishimoto wished for his teams {{to be different from}} the superhero teams in these dramas, dismissing the value of a team in which all the teammates were [...] "strong to the point of perfection". Kishimoto notes that the different roles the characters assume is similar to many role-playing games, and [...] "each character stands <b>out</b> <b>better</b> that way".|$|E

It wasn’t really anything I planned. I wasn’t even ready for this to be a big thing because I’ve had tracks out before. I put my all into everything, but sometimes some tracks come <b>out</b> <b>better</b> than others. It got such a big buzz maybe because it came out the day after and people enjoyed it.” ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed at the White Lodge, in Oxted, Surrey. The episode's burglars are {{played by the}} writers; the pair were quoted as saying [...] "we didn't want to {{dominate}} , so we sometimes play fairly minor characters. But we know that, say, if we were writing something about two burglars, we'd be the burglars." [...] Pemberton suggested that a partial influence for the episode {{may have been the}} children's television series Brum. He said that he and Shearsmith had [...] "always wanted to be a couple of robbers in that, so that might be where the idea came from". Both writers agreed that their roles were [...] "great to perform", and Pemberton described the resulting episode by saying that it [...] "worked <b>out</b> <b>better</b> than [...] could have dreamed".|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Michael Marcantel and written by Dan Greaney, who wanted to explore what Bart's life would end up like. Several designs {{were made by the}} animators for future Bart, but Greaney did not think they matched the personality of the character and had to give clearer instructions on how he wanted him to look. Reception of [...] "Bart to the Future" [...] by critics has been generally mixed to negative. In 2003, it was named the worst episode of the series by Entertainment Weekly writers who felt the [...] "looking-into-the-future premise" [...] was carried <b>out</b> <b>better</b> in [...] "Lisa's Wedding." [...] Around 8.77 million American homes tuned in to watch the episode during its original airing. In 2008, it was released on DVD {{along with the rest of}} the episodes of the eleventh season. The episode attracted renewed attention in the events leading up to the 2016 presidential election, because of a reference to the presidency of Donald Trump.|$|E
500|$|The game went gold on August 5, 2002, and was {{released}} on August 27. After the release of Icewind Dale II, Sawyer expressed dissatisfaction over the Icewind Dale series, saying that, [...] "I wasn't particularly thrilled with how my work on [...] came out..." [...] and, [...] "... managed to actually be worse than my Icewind Dale stuff." [...] In regards to Icewind Dale II he said, [...] " [...] came <b>out</b> <b>better</b> than I expected, but still, not exactly awe-inspiring." [...] Chris Avellone later said, [...] "Icewind Dale was a fun series, but it didn't try to set the bar for {{anything other than a}} fun romp. People may remember enjoying it, but it wasn’t trying to break any new ground or do anything revolutionary. In some respects, it was almost a step back from other games we'd done and focused more on exploration and dungeon crawls." [...] A Collector's Edition containing bonus material, such as a full-color cloth map and soundtrack CD, was also released. Icewind Dale II was the final game developed using the Infinity Engine.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{was working}} as an {{entrepreneur}} in digital audio electronics in 1993 when Barbra Streisand's producer asked him to mix her first concert tour in decades. Jackson signed on partly because he was assured he could {{do anything to make}} her concert sound as good as possible. Jackson determined that huge concert venues such as Wembley Stadium and Madison Square Garden would be carpeted for Streisand, and that expensive heavy drapes would be hung at the walls to damp sound reflections. After discovering that Streisand did not like to listen to any stage monitors made after the 1960s, he designed a stage wedge which used soft dome drivers for midrange and for high frequencies rather than the more powerful compression drivers in common use after the 1970s. As well, the main sound system Jackson specified was a new design by Clair Brothers, a proprietary line array system called the I4. Streisand was not willing to wear in-ear monitors but the band was fitted with them, to reduce stage wash and make the band's instruments stand <b>out</b> <b>better</b> individually in the mix. The stage monitors, line array and extravagant acoustic treatments were a hit with Streisand, who said of Jackson that he was [...] "the best sound engineer in the world." ...|$|E

500|$|The album's {{title and}} opening track, [...] "Dance Again", {{was written by}} RedOne, Enrique Iglesias, Bilal [...] "The Chef", AJ Junior and Pitbull, who is also {{featured}} in the song. After hearing a demo version of the track, she begged Iglesias to let her record the song, telling {{him that it was}} [...] "her song". Lopez, who was going through a divorce with Marc Anthony and the [...] "breakup of a family", felt as if the song had come to her at the [...] "perfect moment". According to Lopez, the period was devastating because family is very important to her. Lopez revealed: [...] "I had to turn that into something better"; she thought: [...] "I don't want to just survive it, I want to come <b>out</b> <b>better</b> than that." [...] Lopez didn't want to be [...] "the woman who stayed in bed for months". [...] "I knew I had to get through it. I'd dance every day, I'd work out, I'd say a little prayer and I still wouldn't feel any better. Then I'd go to bed and get up the next day and do it all again. It was a process, and it very gradually got a little easier ... I had to do it for my kids. I had to get through it for them." [...] She re-wrote parts of the verses to better relate to her experiences. The song [...] "helped lift her out of the darkness" [...] and gave her hope again. Looking back on the song in December 2012, Lopez stated that: [...] "'Dance Again' became my anthem ... an expression of what I needed to do at that time in my life and for what I was taking on with [...] It was a beautiful metaphor that became my reality." ...|$|E
