40|$|The {{existence}} of pseudo-gap states at energies {{larger than the}} coherence energy scale is shown {{to be at the}} origin of the difficulties encountered in achieving strong vortex pinning in the high Tc cuprates. Reduction or elimination of the pseudo-gap states by <b>overdoping</b> is effective in increasing the condensation energy and the irreversibility field. In YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7, a full BCS state, with a single energy scale, can be restored, leading to the highest known irreversibility field and pinning strength.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{intensely}} studied scenarios of high-temperature superconductivity (HTS) postulates pairing by exchange of magnetic excitations [1]. Indeed, such excitations have been observed up to around optimal doping in the cuprates [2 - 7]. In the heavily overdoped regime neutron scattering measurements indicate that magnetic excitations have effectively disappeared [8 - 10], and this was argued to cause the demise of HTS with <b>overdoping</b> [1, 8, 10]. Here we use resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), which is sensitive to complementary parts of reciprocal space, to measure {{the evolution of the}} magnetic excitations in La 2 -xSrxCuO 4 across the entire phase diagram, from a strongly correlated insulator (x = 0) to a non-superconducting metal (x = 0. 40). For x = 0, well-defined magnon excitations are observed [11]. These magnons broaden with doping, but they persist with a similar dispersion and comparable intensity {{all the way to the}} non-superconducting, heavily overdoped metallic phase. The destruction of HTS with <b>overdoping</b> is therefore caused neither by the general disappearance nor by the overall softening of magnetic excitations; other factor(s), such as the redistribution of spectral weight, must be considered.

40|$|The {{effect of}} MCrAlY-bondcoat {{manufacturing}} parameters prior to TBC deposition on the bondcoat oxidation behavior and TBC lifetime was studied. The studied material was a NiCoCrAl(Y/Hf) free-standing coating. It {{was found that}} variation of oxygen partial pressure during vacuum plasma spraying and the vacuum heat treatment procedure significantly affects the yttrium and hafnium distribution in the coating. In coatings sprayed at high pO(2), yttrium and hafnium were mainly tied up into oxide precipitates. This effect is apparently responsible for an early alumina scale spallation and failure of the initially studied TBC system during cyclic oxidation. In contrast, the coating sprayed at low pO(2) revealed an <b>overdoping</b> effect, i. e. extensive yttrium, and hafnium incorporation into the scale resulting in an accelerated scale growth rate and internal oxidation. It was shown that by variation of the vacuum heat treatment parameters the yttrium and hafnium distribution in the near-surface regions of the low oxygen coating can be modified. The latter result demonstrates the potential of minimizing the negative <b>overdoping</b> effect on the scale growth in the thermal-sprayed MCrAlY coatings with low oxygen and/or high reactive element contents by optimization of the vacuum heat treatment procedure...|$|E

40|$|A model {{based on}} the {{alternating}} structure of the imbedded conduction layers (the Cu-O 2 planes) with the charge-transfer-insulator (CTI) layers is proposed. There are three kinds of carriers, each with a different behavior: conduction-like holes in the Cu-O 2 layers and electrons and normal holes in the CTI matrix between the Cu-O 2 layers. This structure explains the strong anisotropies. The relationship is obtained between the concentration nq of conduction-like holes in the Cu-O 2 layers and the temperature T. The anomalous temperature behavior of the resistivity {{as well as the}} Hall constant also follows. We give the hole density in ab plane a definite physical meaning, and also define explicitly optimal doping, <b>overdoping</b> and underdoping. Our model gives the correct temperature dependence of the resistivity and the hole constant on optimal doping, <b>overdoping</b> and underdoping, and it predicts the temperature behavior of the cotangent of the Hall angle quite well. Based on this model, we can also understand that the HiTc materials become "Fermi Liquids" in the extremely overdoped region, and the dR/dT becomes negative below some temperature T< 1. 211 T 0 in the underdoped case. Based on this model, the thermal behaviors of the magnetic susceptibility in different doping can also be easily explained. The resistivity along c-axis is discussed.
