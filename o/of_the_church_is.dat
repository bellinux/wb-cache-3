Close by the front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>is</b> an ancient pond, which was later covered to form a brick-arched reservoir.

5|$|A slender chancel arch existed {{until the}} mid-19th century and might have been pre-Conquest, but the {{earliest}} visible extant part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>is</b> the 13th-century north arcade, {{which may have been}} added to an earlier, now-lost, nave. The spire and tower date {{to the middle of the}} next century, roughly when the nave was rebuilt. Many of the windows are reticulated in a fashion popular during the early 14th century. Several medieval bequests are known: Olivia, wife of John Rossen of Quarrington, left 12 pence to the rector and church each in 1412; a donation of wool was made by another parishioner, Joan, wife of William Ward, around the same time. Later, 8 pence was left to the churchwardens by an unknown resident.|$|E
5|$|From 1915 Gaudí devoted himself almost {{exclusively}} to his magnum opus, the Sagrada Família, a synthesis of his architectural evolution. After completion of the crypt and the apse, still in Gothic style, the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>is</b> conceived in an organic style, imitating natural shapes with their abundance of ruled surfaces. He intended the interior to resemble a forest, with inclined columns like branching trees, helicoidal in form, creating a simple but sturdy structure. Gaudí applied all of his previous experimental findings in this project, from works such as the Park Güell and the crypt of the Colònia Güell, creating a church {{that is at once}} structurally perfect, harmonious and aesthetically satisfying.|$|E
500|$|In 1770, <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>was</b> [...] "repaired and beautified", {{possibly}} by Nicholas Revett, {{who went on}} to design Mereworth Rectory in 1780. In 1798, <b>the</b> advowson <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>was</b> in <b>the</b> ownership <b>of</b> Francis, Lord de Despencer. <b>The</b> annual income <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>was</b> then valued at £14 2s 6d.|$|R
50|$|In 1788 <b>the</b> inside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>was</b> {{modified}} and <b>the</b> imitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Santa Casa di Loreto, set in <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> <b>was</b> {{moved forward}} near the presbitery. In 1828 it was ultimately repositioned in <b>the</b> former Chapel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Massacre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Innocents.|$|R
50|$|Inside, <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>is</b> ornately {{decorated}} by symbolic biblical murals and grand statues. <b>The</b> treasures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> a village legend. At one time, <b>the</b> statues <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>were</b> strung with jewellery by villagers as thanks for prayers answered. But <b>Churches</b> <b>were</b> often robbed of these jewels.|$|R
5|$|Hebron Church is on {{the plain}} of a {{predominantly}} rural agricultural and forested area of southeastern Hampshire County, in the Cacapon River Valley. Baker Mountain, a forested, narrow anticlinal mountain ridge, rises west of the church, and the western rolling foothills of the anticlinal Great North Mountain rise east of the valley. The Cacapon River, just southeast <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> <b>is</b> hidden from the church and cemetery by mature foliage. George Washington National Forest, encompassing the forested area east of the Cacapon River, is east of the church.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} {{corner of the}} south aisle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>is</b> a {{monument}} of the Baber family, who formerly had large possessions in the parish. Inserted in a window of the aisle, is a wooden effigy, supposed to be of Sir John de Hautville, a Knight of Henry III's, who owned the northeastern estate named Norton Hautville, now Norton Hawkfield: in the same directional corner of the church are monuments to the Strach(e)y family who lived at Sutton Court.|$|E

[...] The chancel was restored in 1822. [...] <b>The</b> interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>was</b> divided in about 1970 (<b>the</b> <b>church's</b> own records show this taking place in 1956) for the nave to continue in use as a parish <b>church,</b> and <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> to <b>be</b> preserved by <b>the</b> <b>Churches</b> Conservation Trust.|$|R
