40|$|The {{proliferation}} of Web 2. 0 social networking tools enables {{the creation of}} new open teaching and learning spaces. However the adoption of open social networks to encourage collaborative work around Open Educational Resources (OER) is a more recent phenomenon. This paper investigates the use of an <b>open</b> social <b>forum</b> associated with OER to facilitate informal and formal online activity between learners and teachers. The two participants who are lecturers are familiar with the use of closed and password protected online environments. The developing role of the educator in open social networks is investigated through actual use of OER and <b>open</b> <b>forums</b> for informal learning and the lecturers’ attitudes towards use for formal learning are explored. The findings suggest that one lecturer wanted to consider using open environments for formal learning and one lecturer did not. Although the findings in the main are positive, there is a suggestion that facilitative techniques (both human and activity based) need to be further developed to support and sustain learning communication with OER and associated <b>open</b> <b>forums.</b> This paper gives initial feedback about expected and actual usage of OER and <b>open</b> <b>forums</b> for co-operative and collaborative learning. ...|$|R

25|$|In 1961, Family Radio {{began running}} the <b>Open</b> <b>Forum,</b> a live, weeknight call-in program that Camping hosted until 2011. Listeners {{were invited to}} call in, {{primarily}} with questions {{about the meaning of}} certain passages from the Bible, and Camping answered them by means of interpretations, often with reference to other Biblical passages. Occasionally, questions were posed relating to general Christian doctrine, ranging from the nature of sin and salvation, to matters involving everyday life, such as marriage, sexual morality and education. The <b>Open</b> <b>Forum</b> continued running until Camping's partial retirement in July 2011, and was broadcast on the more than 150 stations owned by Family Radio in the United States. The <b>Open</b> <b>Forum</b> was also translated into many foreign languages and (together with other Family Radio programming) was broadcast worldwide via shortwave station WYFR, a network of AM and FM radio stations, a cable television station and the Internet.
