Inspired by director John Carpenter, {{who had made the}} slasher film Halloween (1978) on a low budget, Cameron used the dream as a [...] "launching pad" [...] to write a slasher-style film. Cameron's agent disliked the Terminator concept and requested that he work <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> After this, Cameron dismissed his agent.|$|E
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the episode, several physicians played a game of baseball to cheer up. Rater called it [...] "her favorite scene", explaining: [...] "I loved the scene where Owen, Derek and Mark take Cristina, Meredith and Lexie to the baseball field. This {{is one of the first}} times Owen has seen Cristina's intensity. And I love that he makes her leave the hospital, focus <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> That's why he's so good for her. The scene was actually inspired by Shonda saying, let's do a scene where they're all playing baseball. But when I finally saw it, it makes me want to write more scenes like that, with our doctors outside of the hospital, little glimpses of them in real life." ...|$|E

500|$|While Insomniac was {{handling}} {{the development of}} the Ratchet & Clank franchise, the team wanted to work <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> With the launch of the PlayStation 3, the team thought users of the new console would be more mature than those of its predecessors and wanted to develop a game to cater for them. They also thought the studio should not specialize in one genre. This new project was part of Insomniac's expansion; the company wanted to have multiple projects in parallel development. This project began development after the completion of Deadlocked. The team agreed to develop something different for a different platform. Inspired by Starship Troopers, [...] was Insomniac's first first-person shooter after Disruptor. To make the game stand-out, they experimented with turning it into a squad-based shooter and introducing giant lizard enemies which were later scrapped. Sony recommended Insomniac to change its lizard antagonist because they were not fun to play with. Furthermore, the team disgreed about the game's setting.|$|E

2500|$|Another future tense {{is formed}} with -ka-, {{with the same}} tones as -dza-. It usually refers to events in the near future.

[...] The name [...] "Contingent Future" [...] was suggested by Henry (1891), as opposed to the -dza- Future, which he called the [...] "Indefinite Future".|$|E

2500|$|The taṇhā, states Walpola Rahula, or [...] "thirst, desire, greed, craving" [...] is what manifests as {{suffering}} and rebirths. However, adds Rahula, {{it is not}} the first cause nor the only cause of dukkha or samsara, because the origination of everything is relative and dependent <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> The Pali canons of Buddhism assert other defilements and impurities (kilesā, sāsavā dhammā), in addition to taṇhā, as the cause of Dukkha. Taṇhā nevertheless, is always listed first, and considered the principal, all-pervading and [...] "the most palpable and immediate cause" [...] of dukkha, states Rahula.|$|E

2500|$|Another way {{gender roles}} affect {{adolescent}} sexuality is thought the sexual double standard. This double standard occurs when others judge women {{for engaging in}} premarital sex and for embracing their sexualities, while men are rewarded for the same behavior. It is a double standard because the genders are behaving similarly, but are being judged differently for their actions because of their gender. An example {{of this can be}} seen in Tolman’s research when she interviews girls about their experiences with their sexualities. In Tolman’s interviews, girls who sought sex because they desired it felt like they had to cover it up in order (for example, they blamed their sexual behavior on drinking) to not be judged by others in their school. They were afraid of being viewed negatively for enjoying their sexuality. Many girls were thus trying to make their own solutions (like blaming their sexual behavior <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> or silencing their own desires and choosing to not engage in sexual behavior) to a problem that is actually caused by power imbalances between the genders within our societies. Other research showed that girls were tired of being judged for their sexual behavior because of their gender. However, even these girls were strongly affected by societal gender roles and rarely talked about their own desires and instead talked about how [...] "being ready" [...] (rather than experiencing desire) would determine their sexual encounters.|$|E
