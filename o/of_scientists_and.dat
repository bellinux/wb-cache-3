5|$|Compton {{was one of}} {{a handful}} <b>of</b> <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> {{philosophers}} to propose a two-stage model of free will. Others include William James, Henri Poincaré, Karl Popper, Henry Margenau, and Daniel Dennett. In 1931, Compton championed the idea of human freedom based on quantum indeterminacy, and invented the notion of amplification of microscopic quantum events to bring chance into the macroscopic world. In his somewhat bizarre mechanism, he imagined sticks of dynamite attached to his amplifier, anticipating the Schrödinger's cat paradox, which was published in 1935.|$|E

5|$|Contrary {{to media}} reports and {{speculation}} at the time, the fires killed very few park animals— surveys indicated {{that only about}} 345 elk (of an estimated 40,000–50,000), 36 deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, and 9 bison had perished. Changes in fire management policies were implemented by land management agencies throughout the United States, based on knowledge gained from the 1988 fires and the evaluation <b>of</b> <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> experts from various fields. By 1992, Yellowstone had adopted a new fire management plan which observed stricter guidelines {{for the management of}} natural fires.|$|E

It also had ocean currents and trade winds that would carry fallout out to sea, an important consideration in view of what had happened at Bikini Atoll during Operation Crossroads.|$|E

5|$|Michał Sędziwój (Sendivogius Polonus) was {{a famous}} in Europe alchemist, who wrote a number of treatises in several languages, {{beginning}} with Novum Lumen Chymicum (1604, with over fifty editions and translations in the 17th and 18th centuries). A member of Emperor Rudolph II's circle <b>of</b> <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> sages, he is believed by some authorities {{to have been a}} pioneer chemist and a discoverer of oxygen, long before Lavoisier (Sendivogius' works were studied by leading scientists, including Isaac Newton).|$|E
5|$|Species is a 1995 American {{science fiction}} horror film {{directed}} by Roger Donaldson and written by Dennis Feldman. It stars Natasha Henstridge (in her debut film role), Ben Kingsley, Michael Madsen, Alfred Molina, Forest Whitaker and Marg Helgenberger. In the film, a motley crew <b>of</b> <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> government agents tries {{to track down}} a seductive alien played by Henstridge before she successfully mates with a human male. Due to her ruthlessness, the alien character was cited {{as an example of}} negative treatment of female sexuality and aliens by Hollywood. The design of Sil was also linked to a chupacabra sighting.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{communities}} {{within the}} park vary with elevation. The TMD has two distinct communities, desert scrub—such as fourwing saltbush and brittlebrush—at the lowest elevations and desert grassland a little higher. The RMD includes these two communities as well as four more at higher elevations, oak woodland, pine–oak woodland, pine forest and, high in the Rincons, mixed conifer forest—Douglas-fir, Ponderosa pine, white fir, Gambel oak, and many other trees, shrubs, and understory plants. During annual inventories in 2011 and 2013, hundreds <b>of</b> <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> thousands of volunteers identified 389 species of vascular plants, 25 of non-vascular plants, and 197 species of fungi in Saguaro National Park.|$|E

5|$|Bonaparte {{believed}} that, {{by establishing}} a permanent presence in Egypt (nominally part of the neutral Ottoman Empire), the French would obtain a staging point for future operations against British India, possibly {{in conjunction with the}} Tipu Sultan of Seringapatam, that might successfully drive the British out of the war. The campaign would sever the chain of communication that connected Britain with India, {{an essential part of the}} British Empire whose trade generated the wealth that Britain required to prosecute the war successfully. The French Directory agreed with Bonaparte's plans, although a major factor in their decision was a desire to see the politically ambitious Bonaparte and the fiercely loyal veterans of his Italian campaigns travel as far from France as possible. During the spring of 1798, Bonaparte assembled more than 35,000 soldiers in Mediterranean France and Italy and developed a powerful fleet at Toulon. He also formed the Commission des Sciences et des Arts, a body <b>of</b> <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> engineers intended to establish a French colony in Egypt. Napoleon kept the destination of the expedition top secret—most of the army's officers did not know of its target, and Bonaparte did not publicly reveal his goal until the first stage of the expedition was complete.|$|E
