2500|$|Acceleration {{presents}} {{gifted children}} academic material from established curricula that is commensurate with their ability and preparedness, {{and for this}} reason is a low-cost option {{from the perspective of the}} school. This may result in a small number of children taking classes targeted at older children. [...] However, for the majority <b>of</b> <b>gifted</b> <b>students,</b> acceleration is beneficial both academically and socially. [...] "Radical acceleration (acceleration by two or more years) is effective academically and socially for highly gifted students." [...] Some advocates have argued that the disadvantages of being retained in a standard mixed-ability classroom are substantially worse than any shortcomings of acceleration. For example, psychologist Miraca Gross reports: [...] "the majority of these children [...] are socially rejected , isolated, and deeply unhappy. Children of IQ 180+ who are retained in the regular classroom are even more seriously at risk and experience severe emotional distress." [...] These accelerated children should be placed together in one class if possible. Research suggests that acceleration might have an impact long after students graduate from high school. For example, one study shows that high-IQ individuals who experienced full-grade acceleration earned higher incomes as adults.|$|E
