25|$|The CNS {{consists}} of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes that are generated from multipotent stem cells. NCRP Report No. 153 provides the following excellent and short {{introduction to the}} composition and cell types of interest for radiation studies of the CNS: “The CNS {{consists of}} neurons differing markedly in size and number per unit area. There are several nuclei or centers that consist of closely packed neuron cell bodies (e.g., the respiratory and cardiac centers in {{the floor of the}} fourth ventricle). In the cerebral cortex the large neuron cell bodies, such as Betz cells, are separated by a considerable distance. Of additional importance are the neuroglia which are the supporting cells and consist of astrocytes, <b>oligodendroglia,</b> and microglia. These cells permeate and support the nervous tissue of the CNS, binding it together like a scaffold that also supports the vasculature. The most numerous of the neuroglia are Type I astrocytes, which make up about half the brain, greatly outnumbering the neurons. Neuroglia retain the capability of cell division in contrast to neurons and, therefore, the responses to radiation differ between the cell types. A third type of tissue in the brain is the vasculature which exhibits a comparable vulnerability for radiation damage to that found elsewhere in the body. Radiation-induced damage to oligodendrocytes and endothelial cells of the vasculature accounts for major aspects of the pathogenesis of brain damage that can occur after high doses of low-LET radiation.” Based on studies with low-LET radiation, the CNS is considered a radioresistant tissue. For example: in radiotherapy, early brain complications in adults usually do not develop if daily fractions of 2 Gy or less are administered with a total dose of up to 50 Gy. The tolerance dose in the CNS, as with other tissues, depends on the volume and the specific anatomical location in the human brain that is irradiated.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oligodendroglia</b> {{are also}} {{susceptible}} to infection by the JC virus, which causes {{progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy}} (PML), a condition that specifically affects white matter, typically in immunocompromised patients. Tumors of <b>oligodendroglia</b> are called oligodendrogliomas. The chemotherapy agent Fluorouracil (5-FU) causes damage to the oligodendrocytes in mice, leading to both acute central nervous system (CNS) damage and progressively worsening delayed degeneration of the CNS.|$|E
5000|$|Oligodendrocyte {{formation}} in the adult brain is associated with glial-restricted progenitor cells, known as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). SVZ cells migrate away from germinal zones to populate both developing white and gray matter, where they differentiate and mature into myelin-forming <b>oligodendroglia.</b> However, {{it is not clear}} whether all oligodendroglial progenitors undergo this sequence of events. It has been suggested that some undergo apoptosis [...] and others fail to differentiate into mature <b>oligodendroglia</b> but persist as adult oligodendroglial progenitors. Remarkably, oligodendrocyte population originated in the subventricular zona can be dramatically expanded by administering epidermal growth factor (EGF).|$|E

50|$|Oligodendrocytes (from Greek, meaning {{cells with}} a few branches), or <b>oligodendroglia,</b> are a type of neuroglia. Their main {{functions}} are to provide support and insulation to axons in {{the central nervous system}} of some vertebrates, equivalent to the function performed by Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. Oligodendrocytes do this by creating the myelin sheath, which is 80% lipid and 20% protein. A single oligodendrocyte can extend its processes to 50 axons, wrapping approximately 1 μm of myelin sheath around each axon; Schwann cells, on the other hand, can wrap around only one axon. Each oligodendrocyte forms one segment of myelin for several adjacent axons.|$|E
5000|$|Oligodendrogliomas cannot {{currently}} be differentiated {{from other}} brain lesions solely by their clinical or radiographic appearance. As such, a brain biopsy {{is the only}} method of definitive diagnosis. Oligodendrogliomas recapitulate {{the appearance of the}} normal resident <b>oligodendroglia</b> of the brain. (Their name derives from the Greek roots 'oligo' meaning [...] " [...] few" [...] and 'dendro' meaning [...] "trees".) They are generally composed of cells with small to slightly enlarged round nuclei with dark, compact nuclei and a small amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. They are often referred to as [...] "fried egg" [...] cells due to their histologic appearance. They appear as a monotonous population of mildly enlarged round cells infiltrating normal brain parenchyma and producing vague nodules. Although the tumor may appear to be vaguely circumscribed, it is by definition a diffusely infiltrating tumor.|$|E

In 1915 he obtained a Rhodes Scholarship to Merton College, Oxford, where he studied neuropathology under Sir Charles Scott Sherrington. After one term at Merton, Penfield went to France where he served as a dresser in a military hospital in the suburbs of Paris. He was wounded in 1916 when the ferry he was aboard, the SS Sussex, was torpedoed. The following year, he married Helen Kermott, and began studying at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, taking his medical degree in 1918; this was followed by a short period as a house surgeon at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston. Returning to Merton College in 1919, Penfield spent the next two years completing his studies; during this time he met William Osler. In 1924, he worked for five months with Pío del Río Hortega characterising the type of glial cells known as <b>oligodendroglia.</b> [...] He also studied in Germany and New York City.|$|E

40|$|Adenosine 3 ′, 5 ′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) accelerates {{the rate}} of {{oligodendrocyte}} differentiation in primary glial cell cultures, while inhibiting proliferation among precursors. It has been unclear whether cAMP regulates differentiation of oligodendrocytes {{in the absence of}} experimental manipulation, nor have biological ligands been identified that regulate <b>oligodendroglia</b> via cAMP. Finally, {{little is known about the}} expression and regulation of the enzymes that synthesize and degrade cAMP in <b>oligodendroglia.</b> To address these issues, we developed a novel immunohistochemical technique to visualize cAMP within single cells. ^ As oligodendrocytes underwent endogenous differentiation in cell culture, basal cAMP levels remained uniformly low. No consistent pattern was detected between basal cAMP levels and oligodendroglial developmental stages, suggesting that differentiation is not initiated by substantial changes in basal cAMP. However, <b>oligodendroglia</b> did require basal cAMP signaling for normal morphological differentiation to occur: in the absence of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity, cells expressed antigenic markers of differentiation, but did not extend elaborate processes, a hallmark of oligodendrocyte differentiation. ^ The biological agonists calcitonin, corticotropin releasing hormone, and vasoactive intestinal peptide elicited cAMP production within <b>oligodendroglia.</b> Prostanoids and β-adrenergic agonists, which have previously been reported to elevate cAMP in <b>oligodendroglia,</b> did not increase cAMP immunofluorescence in <b>oligodendroglia,</b> though they stimulated non-oligodendroglial cells robustly. ^ Cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity was shown to play an important role in regulating cAMP in oligodendrocytes. Isobutylmethylxanthine, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of most PDE types, vinpocetine, a specific inhibitor of the PDE 1 family, and rolipram, a specific inhibitor of the PDE 4 family, inhibited PDE activity in <b>oligodendroglia.</b> Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining with subtype-specific antibodies confirmed the presence of PDE 4 isoforms in <b>oligodendroglia.</b> ^ cAMP regulates diverse developmental processes in <b>oligodendroglia,</b> and is itself precisely controlled.

We report here that MAP 1 B mRNA is markedly up-regulated in the <b>oligodendroglia</b> cell line CG 4 upon induced differentiation, leading to elevated MAP 1 B protein production. A coordinated regulation of homeoprotein transcription factors was observed during CG 4 cell differentiation, which recapitulates the regulation in neurons that promotes MAP 1 B transcription. Hence, transcriptional regulation of MAP 1 B {{appears to be a}} common mechanism in both neurons and <b>oligodendroglia.</b> In addition, we found posttranscriptional regulation of MAP 1 B mRNA by the selective RNA-binding protein QKI in <b>oligodendroglia.</b> The 3 ′UTR of MAP 1 B mRNA interacts with QKI, and oligodendroglia-specific QKI-deficiency in the quakingviable mutant mice resulted in reduced MAP 1 B mRNA expression. Moreover, RNAi-mediated QKI-knockdown caused destabilization of the MAP 1 B mRNA in CG 4 cells. Furthermore, forced expression of exogenous QKI was sufficient for promoting MAP 1 B expression.

40|$|<b>Oligodendroglia</b> support axon {{survival}} and function through mechanisms independent of myelination, and their dysfunction leads to axon degeneration in several diseases. The {{cause of this}} degeneration has not been determined, but lack of energy metabolites such as glucose or lactate has been proposed.

Here we show that the most abundant lactate transporter in the central nervous system, monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT 1, also known as SLC 16 A 1), is highly enriched within <b>oligodendroglia</b> and that disruption of this transporter produces axon damage and neuron loss in animal and cell culture models. In addition, this same transporter is reduced in patients with, and in mouse models of, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, suggesting a role for oligodendroglial MCT 1 in pathogenesis.

40|$|Infection of {{the central}} nervous system (CNS) by the {{neurotropic}} JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) induces an acute encephalomyelitis associated with demyelination. To examine the anti-viral and/or regulatory role of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) signaling in the cell that synthesizes and maintains the myelin sheath, we analyzed JHMV pathogenesis in transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative IFN-γ receptor on <b>oligodendroglia.</b> Defective IFN-γ signaling was associated with enhanced oligodendroglial tropism and delayed virus clearance. However, the CNS inflammatory cell composition and CD 8 + T-cell effector functions were similar between transgenic and wild-type mice, supporting unimpaired peripheral and CNS immune responses in transgenic mice. Surprisingly, increased viral load in <b>oligodendroglia</b> did not affect the extent of myelin loss, the frequency of oligodendroglial apoptosis, or CNS recruitment of macrophages. These data demonstrate that IFN-γ receptor signaling is critical for the control of JHMV replication in <b>oligodendroglia.</b> In addition, the absence of a correlation between increased oligodendroglial infection and the extent of demyelination suggests a complex pathobiology of myelin loss in which infection of <b>oligodendroglia</b> is required but not sufficient...|$|E
40|$|Myelin is {{essential}} for the mammalian brain to function efficiently. Whilst many factors have been associated with regulating the differentiation of <b>oligodendroglia</b> and myelination, glutamate signalling might be particularly important for learning-dependent myelination. The majority of myelinated projection neurons are glutamatergic. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells receive glutamatergic synaptic inputs from unmyelinated axons and oligodendrocyte lineage cells express glutamate receptors which enable them to monitor and respond to changes in neuronal activity. Yet, what role glutamate plays for <b>oligodendroglia</b> is not fully understood.

40|$|Immunohistochemical {{methods have}} been used to {{determine}} the distribution of macroglia and myelin in the normal rat superior colliculus (SC) and in grafts of fetal tectal tissue. The fetal tissue was derived from 15 day-old (E 15) rat embryos and was transplanted onto the midbrain of newborn host rats of the same (PVG/c) strain. Antibodies to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) were used to visualize astrocytes and <b>oligodendroglia</b> respectively. Myelin was lmmunostained with antibodies to either proteolipid protein (PLP) or myelin basic protein (MBP). In the normal SC, GFAP positive astrocytes were found scattered throughout the SC, particularly in the superficidi layers. They were especially prominent at the pial surface, around major blood vessels and at the midline between the two colliculi. CAII immunoreactive <b>oligodendroglia</b> and associated myelin were also found throughout the SC; by far the lowest density was seen in the stratum griseum superficiale (SGS). Both types of macroglial cell were found in abundance in tectal transplants, indicating that the precursors of these glial types were present in the E 15 rat mesencephalon. In mature grafts, large numbers of fibrous astrocytes were found throughout the neuropil and the level of GFAP immunoreactivity was consistently greater than in host SC. Astrocytes seemed to be maintained in a reactive, perhaps immature state within the grafted tissue. Tectal transplants possessed large numbers of fully differentiated CAII-positive <b>oligodendroglia</b> and the grafts contained a dense network of myelinated axons. However the distribution of CAII and PLP immunoreactivity was not homogeneous; there were localized, well-defined regions that contained few <b>oligodendroglia</b> and relatively little myelin. These areas stained intensely for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and were almost certainly homologous to the SGS of normal SC. The relative lack of <b>oligodendroglia</b> in the AChE stained patches in grafts and in SGS in situ suggests that local factors influencing the proliferation and distribution of <b>oligodendroglia</b> in normal SC may have been operating in a similar manner within the tectal transplant neuropil...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedThe data {{presented}} in this thesis is incorporated into the model of early events of coronavirus infection and focuses on the innate responses by glia and their potential interactions with the mounting adaptive immune response. By utilizing transgenic mice to purify distinct populations of glia at different times during coronavirus infection of the central nervous system, the unique cell-specific responses can be evaluated in vivo to provide a fuller picture of the events leading to persistent viral infection. These new findings emphasize the protective role of microglia in providing early IFNalphabeta expression and the indirect modulation of this response by T cell activity. Microglia express a broad repertoire of pathogen associated pattern receptors (i. e. TLRs and RIG-I family helicases) and thereby trigger IFNalphabeta expression in direct response to viral infection. IFNalphabeta expression declines in correlation with effective clearance of virus from microglia by T cell activity. <b>Oligodendroglia</b> upregulated their expression of cytosolic receptors for viral RNA products, RIG-I and Mda 5, during infection. However <b>oligodendroglia</b> were incapable of recognizing coronavirus infection and did not induce IFNalphabeta expression.; Reliance on exogenous IFNalphabeta by mature <b>oligodendroglia</b> {{appears to be a}} prevailing factor driving the preferential infection of <b>oligodendroglia</b> during the acute phase of infection. IFNy can only partially compensate for the loss of IFNbeta mediated anti-viral protection for infected <b>oligodendroglia.</b> Rather IFNy functions primarily in regulating MHC expression in a cell-specific manner thereby facilitating necessary T cell interactions that are also required for control of viral infection. A combination of factors support the persistent infection of <b>oligodendroglia</b> including their lack of autocrine IFNalphabeta activity as well as their limited response to exogenous IFNalphabeta, and their coordinated expression of the inhibitory ligand PD-L 1 with MHC class I in response to IFNy. The contribution of these findings to the current model of coronavirus infection in the central nervous system identifies previously unknown roles for glia and underscores the requirement for an intact innate immune response by resident cells in finally attaining a successful adaptive immune response...|$|E

The Ca 2 + influx was examined directly by loading <b>oligodendroglia</b> with the fluorescent dye Indo- 1 in defined medium, and measuring changes in Ca 2 + in individual cells with a laser cytometer. Upon addition of anti-GalC IgG, a marked sustained increase in intracellular Ca 2 + occurred in 80 % of the <b>oligodendroglia</b> observed.

The effect is specific, since Ca 2 + levels remain normal in <b>oligodendroglia</b> treated with nonimmune IgG; astrocytes do not respond to the anti-GalC. The Ca 2 + response in oligodendrocytes is dependent on concentration of antibody and GalC on the oligodendroglial membrane surface.

After the onset of myelination, however, the major portion of laSS]sulfate was incorporated into sulfatide. Autoradiographs showed a shift of radioactive grains from astroglia and arachnoidal cells to myelin, indicating that actively myelinating <b>oligodendroglia</b> incorporate [35 S]sulfate into myelin sulfatide; there was a concomitant increase in the activity of cerebroside sulfotransferase. In addition, the increasing amounts of proteolipid protein and myeli...|$|E

In the normal optic nerve two types of macroglial cell were identified: astrocytes and <b>oligodendroglia.</b> Degeneration after injury proceeded rapidly in comparison with mammals but {{did not lead to}} the production of a dense scar.

40|$|Partial {{injury to}} {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) is {{exacerbated}} by additional loss of neurons and glia via toxic events known as secondary degeneration. Using partial transection of the rat optic nerve (ON) as a model, we have previously shown that myelin decompaction persists during secondary degeneration. Failure to repair myelin abnormalities during secondary degeneration may be attributed to insufficient OPC proliferation and/or differentiation to compensate for loss of oligodendrocyte lineage cells (<b>oligodendroglia).</b> Following partial ON transection, we found that sub-populations of <b>oligodendroglia</b> and other olig 2 + glia were differentially influenced by injury. A high proportion of NG 2 +/olig 2 –, NG 2 +/ olig 2 + and CC 12 /olig 2 + cells proliferated (Ki 67 +) at 3 days, prior to the onset of death (TUNEL+) at 7 days, suggesting injury-related cues triggered proliferation rather than early loss of <b>oligodendroglia.</b> Despite this, a high proportion (20 %) of the NG 2 +/olig 2 + OPCs were TUNEL+ at 3 months, and numbers remained chronically lower, indicating that proliferation of these cells was insufficient to maintain population numbers. There was significant death of NG 2 +/olig 2 – and NG 22 /olig 2 + cells at 7 days, however population densities remained stable, suggesting proliferation was sufficient to sustain cell numbers. Relatively few TUNEL+/CC 1 + cells were detected at 7 days, and no change in density indicated that mature CC 1 + oligodendrocytes were resistant to secondary degeneration in vivo. Mature CC 1 +/olig 2 – oligodendrocyte density increased at 3 days, reflecting early oligogenesis, while the appearance of shortened myelin internodes at 3 months suggeste...|$|E
