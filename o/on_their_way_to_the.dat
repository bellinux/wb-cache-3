5|$|During {{the regular}} season, the Penguins {{finished}} second in the Eastern Conference, behind the Montreal Canadiens. With a 12–2 record in the playoffs, the team eliminated the Senators, the New York Rangers and the Flyers, <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 2008 Stanley Cup Finals, the franchise's first in 16years. The team was defeated in the Stanley Cup Final by the Detroit Red Wings in six games.|$|E
5|$|Early Tiger IIs proved unreliable, owing principally to leaking {{seals and}} gaskets, and an {{overburdened}} drive train originally intended for a lighter vehicle. The double radius steering gear was initially particularly prone to failure. Lack of crew training could amplify this problem; drivers originally given only limited training on other tanks were often sent directly to operational units already <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front.|$|E
5|$|Leicester's longest ever unbeaten run in {{the league}} was between 1 November 2008 and 7 March 2009, to which they {{remained}} unbeaten for 23 games <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> League One title. (This was their only ever season in the third tier of English football). Their longest run of consecutive victories in the league is nine, which they achieved between 21 December 2013 and 1 February 2014 (in the Championship).|$|E

5|$|Spokane {{became an}} {{important}} rail and shipping center because of its location between mining and farming areas. In the early 1880s, gold and silver were discovered in the Inland Empire; as a regional shipping center, the city furnished supplies to the miners who passed through <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mineral-rich Coeur d'Alene, Colville and Kootenay districts. The mining districts are still considered among the most productive in North America.|$|E
5|$|The scallop is {{the symbol}} of St James and is called Coquille Saint-Jacques in French. It is an emblem carried by pilgrims <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shrine of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia. The shell became {{associated}} with the pilgrimage and came {{to be used as}} a symbol showing hostelries along the route and later as a sign of hospitality, food and lodging elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Whether the Republican valley was {{abandoned}} after the Omaha attack is not recorded.

The power of the Omahas was broken soon thereafter: in about 1801, a smallpox epidemic spread from the Skidis to the Omahas, killing half of the tribe, Blackbird among them.|$|E

5|$|Alexios had {{anticipated}} {{help in the}} form of mercenary forces from the West, but he was totally unprepared for the immense and undisciplined force that soon arrived in Byzantine territory. It was no comfort to Alexios to learn that four of the eight leaders of {{the main body of the}} Crusade were Normans, among them Bohemund. Since the crusade had to pass through Constantinople, however, the Emperor had some control over it. He required its leaders to swear to restore to the empire any towns or territories they might reconquer from the Turks <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Holy Land. In return, he gave them guides and a military escort.|$|E
5|$|Brian and Stewie {{decide to}} go to the North Pole to kill Santa, but Brian does not want Stewie to get {{disappointed}} if Santa is not what everybody thinks he is; to this Stewie responds that Brian is as negative as Eeyore from Winnie-the-Pooh. To prevent Stewie from going to the North Pole he tells him that Santa is not real; Stewie questions this, also asking if Elmo, SpongeBob SquarePants and Curious George aren't real. <b>On</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> North Pole, Brian and Stewie find themselves in Canada, where they meet a man with a thick Canadian accent; they also see the Aurora borealis and the Aurora Boreanaz (an aurora with David Boreanaz's face).|$|E

5|$|Construction of the Sloatsburg station {{dates back}} to the 1830s, when the station was built along the Erie Railroad. The station served the line heading to Port Jervis northward, along with a stagecoach to Greenwood Lake three times a day. The station was {{populated}} by fishermen <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lake, but has been the site of several accidents. These calamities include a derailed milk train in 1843 and a fatal accident between the train line and several mules and their owner in 1855. The station became part of Metro-North in 1983, when the service was created. The station was listed under a revitalization plan in 2005 to help serve its commuters.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} events, 91 revolutionaries {{were sentenced to}} exile. Of these, a small group was transported by barges from Giurgiu, <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Austrian-ruled Svinița, near the Danube port of Orschowa. The revolutionary artist Constantin Daniel Rosenthal and Maria Rosetti, both {{of whom had been}} allowed to go free and had {{subsequently}} followed the barges on shore, pointed out that the Ottomans had stepped out of their jurisdiction, and were able to persuade the mayor of Svinița to disarm the guards, which in turn allowed the prisoners to flee. The escapees then made their way to Paris.|$|E
5|$|In 1847, the Whitman {{massacre}} and the Cayuse War in {{what became}} southeastern Washington raised fears among white settlers {{throughout the region}} {{and led to the}} formation of large volunteer militias organized to fight Indians. Along the Rogue, tensions intensified in 1848 at the start of the California Gold Rush, when hundreds of men from the Oregon Territory passed through the Rogue Valley <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sacramento River basin. After Indians attacked a group of returning miners along the Rogue in 1850, former territorial governor Joseph Lane negotiated a peace treaty with Apserkahar, a leader of the Takelma Indians. It promised protection of Indian rights and safe passage through the Rogue Valley for white miners and settlers.|$|E

5|$|In mid-June 1941, the {{division}} received new orders to relocate. The 16th Panzer Division crossed the German–Polish border at Groß Wartenberg heading for Ożarów at the Vistula, which was reached on 19 June 1941. The German soldiers initially {{believed that they}} were just going to transit through Russia, <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Middle East where they would link up with Erwin Rommel's Afrika Corps. But Generalfeldmarschall (Field Marshal) Walther von Reichenau, who visited his son, a Leutnant in the 4th company of Panzer-Regiment 2, revealed to them the true objective of the next campaign. It would be Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|In {{the year}} of Coloman's coronation, at least five large groups of crusaders arrived in Hungary <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Holy Land. He annihilated the bands who were {{entering}} his kingdom unauthorized or pillaging the countryside, but the main crusader army crossed Hungary without incident. He invaded Croatia in 1097, defeating its last native king Petar Svačić. Consequently, he was crowned king of Croatia in 1102. According to the late 14th-century Pacta conventa (the authenticity of which is not universally accepted by scholars), he was only crowned after having ratified a treaty {{with the leaders of}} the Croatian nobility. For centuries thereafter, the Hungarian monarchs were also the kings of Croatia.|$|E
5|$|Tottenham's second-choice goalkeeper Michel Vorm {{had played}} {{all of their}} {{fixtures}} <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> final, but was dropped to the bench and replaced with Hugo Lloris for the decisive game. Compared to their defeat at Fiorentina, Tottenham made three changes in defence, with only Jan Vertonghen retaining his place – Vlad Chiricheș, Federico Fazio and Ben Davies were replaced by Kyle Walker, Eric Dier and Danny Rose, with Chiricheș not even featuring on the substitutes' bench. Defensive midfielder Benjamin Stambouli and attacking midfielder Érik Lamela were replaced by Ryan Mason and Andros Townsend respectively, with the lone striker position changing from Roberto Soldado to Harry Kane.|$|E

5|$|After his victory, Basil II {{advanced}} towards Strumitsa, {{which was}} key to holding the whole Vardar valley. <b>On</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city, the Byzantines seized the Matsukion fortress {{to the east}} of their advance. The Byzantine Emperor also sent an army under Botaneiates to surround Strumitsa and destroy all ramparts to the south and clear the passage to Thessalonica. With the remainder of his troops, Basil laid siege to the city itself. The Bulgarians allowed Botaneiates to destroy the fortifications, but he and his army were ambushed by Bulgarian raiders in a narrow valley, soon after their task was complete. In the ensuing battle Botaneiates was completely defeated and the Bulgarian commander Gabriel Radomir personally stabbed Botaneiates with his spear. As a result, Basil II was forced to abandon the siege of Strumitsa and retreat. On the return, the eloquence of the cubicularius Sergius convinced the defenders of Melnik to surrender, another heavy blow for the Bulgarians as the town guarded the main road to Sofia from the south.|$|E
5|$|At first Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang {{is just a}} big and {{powerful}} car, but as the book progresses the car surprises the family by beginning to exhibit independent actions. This first happens while the family is caught in a traffic jam <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beach for a picnic. The car suddenly instructs Commander Pott to pull a switch which causes Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang to sprout wings and take flight over the stopped cars on the road. Commander Pott flies them to Goodwin Sands in the English Channel where the family picnics, swims, and sleeps. While the family naps, the tide comes in threatening to drown them. Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang wakes them just in time with a hiss of steam. At the car's direction, Commander Pott pulls another switch which causes it to transform into a hovercraft-like vehicle. They make for the French coast and land on a beach near Calais. They explore along the beach and find a cave boobytrapped with some devices intended to scare off intruders. At {{the back of the}} cave is a store of armaments and explosives. The family detonates the cache of explosives and flees the cave.|$|E

Here they find the videotape setup and tapes dating {{all the way back to}} the '60s, including one of Amber Lynn LaPierre. The man who runs the park is promptly arrested, and Mulder finds graves of children all over his ranch.|$|E
