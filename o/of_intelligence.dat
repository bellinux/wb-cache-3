40|$|The {{intent of}} the present study was to examine the {{strength}} of the relationship between language proficiency in English and the 9 types <b>of</b> <b>intelligences.</b> As such, the objectives of this study were three-folded. The primary objective of the study was to investigate the relationship between multiple intelligences and language proficiency among the Iranian Ph. D candidates who participated in Shiraz University Ph. D Entrance Exam. The second objective of the study was to explore whether one <b>of</b> the <b>intelligence</b> types or a combination <b>of</b> <b>intelligences</b> are predictors <b>of</b> language proficiency. Finally, the study aims at investigating the effect of sex on language proficiency and types <b>of</b> <b>intelligences.</b> To fulfill this objective, a 100 -item language proficiency test and a 90 -item multiple intelligences questionnaire were distributed among 278 male and female Iranians taking part in the Ph. D Entrance exam to Shiraz University. The data gathered were analyzed descriptively utilizing central tendency measures (mean and standard deviation). Moreover, the collected data were analyzed inferentially using correlation, regression analysis and independent t-test. The results indicated that there is not a significant relationship between language proficiency and the combination <b>of</b> <b>intelligences</b> in general and the types <b>of</b> <b>intelligences</b> in particular. Similarly, the results revealed no significant difference between male and female participants regarding language proficiency and types <b>of</b> <b>intelligences.</b> Moreover, none <b>of</b> the <b>intelligence</b> types was diagnosed as the predictor for language proficiency. The results of this investigation point to no significant relationship between multiple intelligences and English language proficiency in the Iranian context. Clearly, the results are local not universal...|$|R

40|$|Research on learner {{characteristics}} {{has shown}} {{that there are many}} differences among learners. One of them is the style they use for learning and solving problems, so that we can talk about concrete and abstract learners, deductive and inductive learners, analytic and holistic learners, active and reflective learners and so on. Another characteristic is the types <b>of</b> <b>intelligences</b> they possess or are more dominant in relation to the other types <b>of</b> <b>intelligences.</b> In that respect we can differentiate between linguistic, logical, musical, spatial and other types <b>of</b> <b>intelligences.</b> The different learning styles and the different types <b>of</b> <b>intelligences</b> students possess require different approaches and activities which will enable learners to acquire knowledge and develop skills in their preferred way. However, in order to help learners to reach their potential and to become successful in both their personal and professional life, teachers need to encourage learners to discover other ways of learning and to develop other skills and abilities besides those that they already possess. This paper discusses the possibilities that information technology offers for reaching that aim and gives suggestions for using various technological tools in the classroom that will help learners to use and develop different learning styles and different types <b>of</b> <b>intelligences...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} <b>of</b> emotional <b>intelligence</b> {{to employees}} ‟ career development and {{success has been}} stressed in business papers.

The results of the questionnaire and the data generated from observations have been used in designing sets of activities for various types <b>of</b> <b>intelligences</b> (logical mathematical and linguistic). The overall activities of students were analyzed and compared to the intelligence's profiles. The current student's activities were also related to the ongoing curriculum prescriptions and recommendations. Study cases were designed for several students. The research has revealed the existence of the types and levels <b>of</b> <b>intelligences,</b> as defined in the theory and raised the question, to what extent the levels of a symbolic approach to learning can possibly be used in the curriculum design from the perspective of this theory...|$|R
