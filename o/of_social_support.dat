Research that followed the development of this model has suggested that {{one or more of the}} components of the DCS model (high psychological workload, low control, and lack <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>support),</b> if not the exact combination represented by iso-strain, have adverse effects of physical and mental health.|$|E
25|$|For {{three years}} in a row, more than 30 percent of Mississippi's {{residents}} have been classified as obese. In a 2006 study, 22.8 percent of the state's children were classified as such. Mississippi had the highest rate of obesity of any U.S. state from 2005 to 2008, and also ranks first in the nation for high blood pressure, diabetes, and adult inactivity. In a 2008 study of African-American women, contributing risk factors were shown to be: lack of knowledge about body mass index (BMI), dietary behavior, physical inactivity and lack <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>support,</b> defined as motivation and encouragement by friends. A 2002 report on African-American adolescents noted a 1999 survey which suggests that a third of children were obese, with higher ratios for those in the Delta.|$|E
25|$|Fostering {{resilience}} {{in children}} requires family environments that are caring and stable, hold {{high expectations for}} children’s behavior and encourage participation {{in the life of}} the family. Most resilient children have a strong relationship with at least one adult, not always a parent, and this relationship helps to diminish risk associated with family discord. The definition of parental resilience, as the capacity of parents to deliver a competent and quality level of parenting to children, despite the presence of risk factors, has proven to be a very important role in children's resilience. Understanding the characteristics of quality parenting is critical to the idea of parental resilience. Even if divorce produces stress, the availability <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>support</b> from family and community can reduce this stress and yield positive outcomes. Any family that emphasizes the value of assigned chores, caring for brothers or sisters, and the contribution of part-time work in supporting the family helps to foster resilience. Resilience research has traditionally focused on the well being of children, with limited academic attention paid to factors that may contribute to the resilience of parents.|$|E

25|$|Attachment theory also postulates {{that all}} humans possess an innate {{attachment}} behavioural system that motivates them to seek proximity to a caregiver (also called an attachment figure) {{during times of}} threat or need. Caregiving behaviour is therefore complimentary to attachment behaviour. Furthermore, attachment theory argues that {{the effectiveness of the}} caregiving behaviour enacted determines the quality of the attachment bond between the caregiver and care-recipient, as well as shapes the care-recipient’s general expectations <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>support.</b> In this model, a history of receiving effective care from intimate others (whether parents in childhood or romantic partners in adulthood) promotes a sense of attachment security – an interpersonal orientation characterized by the expectation that other people may be relied on for support, and subsequent comfort with intimacy and emotional closeness. In contrast, a history of interactions with cold or rejecting caregivers promotes attachment avoidance – an interpersonal orientation marked by discomfort with intimacy, a reluctance to rely on others for support, and the tendency to suppress emotional distress. Care that is inconsistent or intrusive is believed to foster attachment anxiety, which is characterized by excessive preoccupation with intimate relationships and inability to effectively regulate one’s own emotional distress.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{measures}} of the quality and availability <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>supports</b> were found to moderate risk for depression associated {{with a history of}} maltreatment and the presence of the short (s) allele of the serotonin transporter gene promoter polymorphism (5 -HTTLPR). The present investigation (i) replicates research in adults showing that 5 -HTTLPR variation moderates the development of depression after stress, (ii) extends the finding to children, and (iii) demonstrates the ability <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>supports</b> to further moderate risk for depression. Maltreated children with the s/s genotype and no positive supports had the highest depression ratings, scores that were twice as high as the non-maltreated comparison children with the same genotype. However, the presence of positive supports reduced risk associated with maltreatment and the s/s genotype, such that maltreated children with this profile had only minimal increases in their depression scores. These findings are consistent with emerging preclinical and clinical data suggesting that the negative sequelae associated with early stress are not inevitable.

40|$|Adolescent {{parenting}} {{has been}} a major concern in our society due to the numerous negative consequences associated with parenting at an early age. <b>Social</b> <b>supports</b> have been indicated as an important factor in improving outcomes of stressful life events, as well as better overall adjustment. Specifically, <b>social</b> <b>supports</b> can provide adolescent mothers with the necessary support to improve well being for themselves as well as their children. With this in mind, it is useful to explore factors that may influence support mobilization among adolescent mothers. ^ In the present study, the relationship between perceived satisfaction <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>supports,</b> locus <b>of</b> control, and beliefs in the efficacy of help seeking behaviors, as they relate to the mobilization <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>supports</b> was examined. In addition, other factors that may influence support mobilization, such as depression, perceived stress, and psychosocial development were also examined. The sample consisted of 85 adolescent mothers with ages ranging from 15 – 25 years of age. Participants were drawn from a social service agency which provides supportive services for pregnant and parenting teens. The participants completed a battery of self-report measures consisting of: The Multidimensional Scale <b>of</b> Perceived <b>Social</b> <b>Support</b> Scale, The Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control Scale (Adult Version), The Efficacy of Help Seeking, The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, The Perceived Stress Scale, and The Erikson Psychosocial Stages Inventory. Participants also completed a demographic sheet to gather background information. ^ Overall results indicate that, although a direct link between the variables examined in this study and the mobilization <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>supports</b> cannot be stated explicitly, it appears they can exert some influence on the choices adolescent mothers make in terms <b>of</b> mobilizing <b>social</b> <b>supports.</b> For example, an internal locus of control was found to be significantly associated with more perceived satisfaction with <b>social</b> <b>supports,</b> more positive beliefs in the efficacy of help seeking, lower levels of depression, and less perceived stress. Additional analyses indicated locus of control has a mediational effect on the relationship between Perceived Stress and the outcome variables. Exploratory analyses also indicated that psychosocial development may also influence support mobilization. The present study can be useful in terms of service development and implementation for adolescent mothers. ...|$|R

40|$|Students {{could achieve}} the best {{performance}} in class if parents have the same opinion in giving clear and positive values about the efforts and expectations of school. Students’ academic achievement which controlled by parents will be better. Achir’s research (2004) discusses {{about the role of}} parents in establishing intellectual abilities. Creativity and restriction from parents showed the great attention to students with talent, especially concerned in learning attitude, diligence, tenacity, etc. Giving less restriction leads the students with talents could not develop and achieve {{the best performance}} in class. This research tried to prove that students with talent, concerned in Senior High School, still need the supports, motivation, and control from the parents. The same case also happened for the acceleration class students. They need support from their parents in their learning process in acceleration class.

2500|$|There are {{assertions that}} race affects {{the rate of}} SLE. However, a 2010 review of studies which {{correlate}} race and SLE identified several sources of systematic and methodological error, indicating that the connection between race and SLE may be spurious. For example, studies show that social support is a modulating factor which buffers against SLE-related damage and maintains physiological functionality. Studies have not been conducted to determine whether people of different racial backgrounds receive differing levels <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>support.</b> If there is a difference, this could act as a confounding variable in studies correlating race and SLE. Another caveat to note when examining studies about SLE is that symptoms are often self-reported. This process introduces additional sources of methodological error. Studies have shown that self-reported data is affected by {{more than just the}} patients experience with the disease- social support, the level of helplessness, and abnormal illness-related behaviors also factor into a self-assessment. Additionally, other factors like the degree <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>support</b> that a person receives, socioeconomic status, health insurance, and access to care can contribute to an individual’s disease progression. Racial differences in lupus progression have not been found in studies that control for the socioeconomic status [...] of participants. Studies that control for the SES of its participants have found that non-white people have more abrupt disease onset compared to white people and that their disease progresses more quickly. Non-white patients often report more hematological, serosal, neurological, and renal symptoms. However, the severity of symptoms and mortality are both similar in white and non-white patients. Studies that report different rates of disease progression in late-stage SLE are most likely reflecting differences in socioeconomic status and the corresponding access to care. [...] The people who receive medical care have often accrued less disease-related damage and {{are less likely to be}} below the poverty line. Additional studies have found that education, marital status, occupation, and income create a social context which contributes to disease progression.|$|E

Studies have also shown that college students' perceptions <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>support</b> have shifted from viewing support as stable to viewing them as variable and fluctuating. In the face of such mounting stress, students naturally seek support from family and friends in order to alleviate psychological distress. A study by Chao found a significant two-way correlation between perceived stress and social support, as well as a significant three-way correlation between perceived stress, social support, and dysfunctional coping. The results indicated that high levels of dysfunctional coping deteriorated the association between stress and well-being at both high and low levels <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>support,</b> suggesting that dysfunctional coping can deteriorate the positive buffering action <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>support</b> on well-being. Students who reported social support were found {{more likely to engage in}} less healthy activities, including sedentary behavior, drug and alcohol use, and too much or too little sleep. Lack <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>support</b> in college students is also strongly related to life dissatisfaction and suicidal behavior.|$|E
