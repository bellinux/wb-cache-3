5|$|A {{prominent}} {{tradition is}} that of the ship burial, where the deceased was laid in a boat, or a stone ship, and given grave offerings in accordance with his earthly status and profession, sometimes including sacrificed slaves. Afterwards, piles of stone and soil were usually laid on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> {{in order to create a}} tumulus.|$|E
5|$|After an {{overhaul}} in the New York Naval Shipyard and a training cruise to Cuba, Missouri returned to New York. During {{the afternoon of}} 21 March 1946, she received {{the remains of the}} Turkish Ambassador to the United States, Münir Ertegün. She departed on 22 March for Gibraltar, and on 5 April anchored in the Bosphorus off Istanbul. She rendered full honors, including the firing of 19-gun salutes during the transfer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> of the late ambassador and again during the funeral ashore.|$|E
5000|$|Arkils tingstad ("Assembly {{location}} <b>of</b> Arkil") is <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Viking Age {{thing or}} assembly {{location of a}} hundred in Uppland, Sweden.

5|$|All {{excavated}} tombs were intrusive burials interred under residential platforms. They {{were all}} {{found in a}} squatting position without any particular orientation. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> were found accompanied by a broken obsidian blade. Some burials had other offerings, for example that of a woman accompanied by domestic utensils, {{some of which were}} blackened with soot. Two child burials each had a jade bead and the burial of an elderly male was accompanied by pieces of burnt pine and evergreen oak.|$|E
5|$|American {{explorer}} John Lloyd Stephens and English architect Frederick Catherwood {{visited the}} site in 1840, at which {{time it was a}} confused jumble of overgrown ruins. Stephens published a description of the archaeological remains a year later. Catherwood did not draw any of the structures due to the poor state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains.</b> The two excavated one of the mounds and recovered some ceramic vessels, which Catherwood drew.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists have {{attempted}} to test the suicide theory, particularly by the examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> of skulls, but {{have been unable to}} reach a conclusion. The suicide theory cannot be ruled out by the archaeological evidence, but {{there is no evidence to}} support it, either.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Habsburgs had been {{involved}} in a major power struggle with the French kings of the House of Valois over the control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> of the realm of Charles the Bold, whose daughter and heiress Mary Maximilian had married. Maximilian's second marriage in 1493 with Bianca Maria Sforza from Milan then got the Habsburgs directly involved in the Italian Wars, clashing again with the French kings over the control of the Duchy of Milan.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{have complained}} that, by museum display <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains,</b> {{the body of}} Lindow Man has been {{objectified}} rather than treated with the respect due the dead. Emma Restall Orr, a neo-druid, has questioned whether the body should be displayed at all. This {{is part of a}} wider discussion about the scientific treatment of human remains and museum researchers and archaeologists using them as information sources.|$|E
5|$|Discovery then sailed south, {{arriving}} at Cape Adare on 9 January 1902. After a brief landing and examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> of Borchgrevink's camp, the ship continued southwards along the Victoria Land coast. At McMurdo Sound Discovery turned eastward, touching land again at Cape Crozier where a pre-arranged message point {{was set up}} so that relief ships {{would be able to}} locate the expedition. She then followed the Barrier to its eastern extremity where, on 30 January, the land predicted by Ross was confirmed, and named King Edward VII Land.|$|E

5|$|Following this {{declaration}} by the Dean, demolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> {{of the old}} cathedral {{began in}} 1668. Demolition of the Old Cathedral proved unexpectedly difficult as the stonework had been bonded together by molten lead. Wren initially used the then-new technique of using gunpowder {{to bring down the}} surviving stone walls. Like many experimental techniques, the use of gunpowder was not easy to control; several workers were killed and nearby residents complained about noise and damage. Eventually, Wren resorted to using a battering ram instead. Building work on the new cathedral began in June 1675.|$|E
5|$|In 1999 a local {{maritime}} historian, Paul Barnett, commenced a privately-funded {{research project}} which saw the site's 86 vessels recorded and recognised {{as the largest}} ships' graveyard in mainland Britain. The Nautical Archaeology Society investigated the site in 2008 {{as part of its}} Diving into History Project, and carried out laser scanning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains.</b> In 2010 British Waterways took control of the site in an attempt to protect it.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, Lorenzo Hagglund, {{a veteran}} of World War I and a history buff, began searching the strait for remains of the battle. In 1932 he found the remains of Royal Savages hull, which he {{successfully}} raised in 1934. Stored for more than fifty years, the remains were sold by his son to the National Civil War Museum. As of March 2009, the remains were in a city garage in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The city of Plattsburgh, New York, has claimed ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> and would like them returned to upstate New York.|$|E
5000|$|Funerary {{cannibalism}} is <b>the</b> practice <b>of</b> eating <b>the</b> <b>remains.</b> This may be {{for many}} reasons: for example to partake of their strength, to spiritually [...] "close the circle" [...] by reabsorbing their life into the family or clan, to annihilate an enemy, or due to pathological mental conditions. The Yanomami have <b>the</b> practice <b>of</b> cremating <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> and then eating the ashes with banana paste.|$|R
50|$|At <b>the</b> {{northern}} end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island a Bronze Age cist contains <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> a female skeleton, <b>the</b> Queen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Inch. <b>The</b> <b>remains</b> were removed for carbon dating {{and are now}} displayed behind a pane of glass in their original position.|$|R

5|$|Musculoskeletal {{analysis}} showed significant gender lifestyle variation. Greater leg muscle development {{was found in}} males of the Parc Cwm cromlech, possibly the result of hunting or herding, confirming the sexual dimorphism found in previous analyses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains.</b> In contrast, no such variation was noticeable in the remains found during excavations from other nearby sites, for example the Tinkinswood burial chamber, in the Vale of Glamorgan. The variation in musculoskeletal stress markers may indicate a mobile lifestyle {{for at least some}} of the males analysed.|$|E
5|$|On {{its walls}} {{are dozens of}} bronze plaques that {{indicate}} the locations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> of most of Mexico City's former archbishops, including Cardinal Ernesto Corripio y Ahumada.

5|$|Oryol {{took the}} lead after Borodino was sunk; she was joined by Nebogatov's Second Division after Tōgō ordered the Japanese battleships to {{disengage}} in the gathering darkness. Nebogatov assumed command <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> of the fleet and they continued towards Vladivostok. The ships were discovered by the Japanese early the following morning and attacked by Tōgō's battleships around 10:00. The faster Japanese ships stayed beyond the range at which Nebogatov's ships could effectively reply {{and he decided to}} surrender his ships at 10:30 as he could neither return fire nor close the range.|$|E

5|$|The {{location}} of the castle was important both because it controlled an important mountain pass, and possibly because Llywelyn claimed authority as {{the lord of the}} mountains and coasts of Wales: several of his castles appear to have been located with such political symbolism in mind. It is also possible that Llywelyn may have built his castle on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> of a previous fortification constructed by Maelgwn Gwynedd, a king of Gwynedd in the 6th century, although no such remains have been found.|$|E
5|$|A log {{portion of}} the {{original}} Oklahoma Row was moved north and now sits {{on the east side}} of Highway 94 in Monte Ne. It is used for storage. The three-story concrete-and-stone tower still stands and remains above water on the edge of Beaver Lake. This section is often incorrectly referred to as the bank building and the honeymoon suite. Monte Ne was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 because of the historic significance of being so closely associated with Harvey and its unique architecture and engineering. Despite this, what is left of Monte Ne has fallen victim to severe neglect and vandalism. It is covered with spray paint and graffiti, as well as being cracked and full of debris. In 2011 the fire department was called to help a person who had climbed to the top floor and gotten stuck in the chimney. Because of this incident and the general state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains,</b> the Army Corps of Engineers erected a temporary barbed wire fence around the tower.|$|E
5|$|A {{tower was}} built out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> of the roof, {{similar to one}} that had existed at Claremont Road, and a system of defences and {{blockades}} were built. A core of around 30 protesters ensured that there were always people staying there (a legal requirement for a squatted home, {{as well as a}} defence against eviction). They were finally evicted on 21 June 1995, whereupon, as at Claremont Road, the building was immediately demolished. The total cost of removing the protesters from Munstonia was given to be £239,349.52, not including additional costs of security guards.|$|E
