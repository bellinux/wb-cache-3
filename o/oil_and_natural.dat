5|$|There {{are large}} {{deposits}} of petroleum (as <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>natural</b> gas) in rocks beneath the seabed. Offshore platforms and drilling rigs extract the oil or gas and store it for transport to land. Offshore {{oil and gas}} production can be difficult due to the remote, harsh environment. Drilling for oil in the sea has environmental impacts. Animals may be disorientated by seismic waves used to locate deposits, probably causing the beaching of whales. Toxic substances such as mercury, lead, and arsenic may be released. The infrastructure may cause damage and oil may be spilt.|$|E

25|$|Recently {{there has}} been a large {{increase}} in international agreements and national Energy Action Plans, such as the EU 2009 Renewable Energy Directive, to increase the use of renewable energy due to the growing concerns about pollution from energy sources that come from fossil fuels such as <b>oil,</b> coal, <b>and</b> <b>natural</b> gas. One such initiative was the United Nations Development Programme's World Energy Assessment in 2000 that highlighted many challenges humanity would have to overcome in order to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. From 2000–2012 renewable energy grew at a rate higher than any other point in history, with a consumption increase of 176.5 million tonnes of oil. During this period, <b>oil,</b> coal, <b>and</b> <b>natural</b> gas continued to grow and had increases that were much higher than the increase in renewable energy. The following figures illustrate the growth in consumption of fossil fuels such as <b>oil,</b> coal, <b>and</b> <b>natural</b> gas as well as renewable sources of energy during this period.|$|R

The top three destinations for exports were Mexico, Canada, and Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Lethbridge's economy {{developed}} from drift mines opened by Nicholas Sheran in 1874 and the North Western Coal and Navigation Company in 1882. North Western's president was William Lethbridge, from whom the city derives its name. By {{the turn of}} the century, the mines employed about 150 men and producing 300 tonnes of coal each day. In 1896, local collieries were the largest coal producers in the Northwest Territories, with production peaking during World War I. An internment camp was set up at the Exhibition Building in Lethbridge from September 1914 to November 1916. After the war, increasing <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>natural</b> gas production gradually replaced coal production, and the last mine in Lethbridge closed in 1957.|$|E
