25|$|Wiener was {{an early}} studier of {{stochastic}} and mathematical noise processes, contributing work relevant to electronic engineering, electronic communication, and control systems. It was Wiener's idea to model a signal {{as if it were}} an exotic type of noise, giving it a sound mathematical basis. The example we give <b>our</b> <b>students</b> nowadays is that English text could be modeled as a random string of letters and spaces, where each letter of the alphabet (and the space) has an assigned probability. But Wiener dealt with analog signals, where such a simple example doesn't exist. Wiener is unlucky in that his early work on information theory and signal processing was limited to analog signals, and was largely forgotten with the development of the digital theory.|$|E
