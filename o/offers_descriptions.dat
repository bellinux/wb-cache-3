50|$|The Songs {{describe}} worship {{around the}} throne of God in the heavenly realms. Reference is made to angelic tongues. Throughout the thirteen songs there is everything ranging from accounts of how the angels lead their prayer service in the temple on high to detailed descriptions of the inner throne room where the presence of God and the other god-like beings reside. The scrolls can be categorized into three larger sections: 1-5, 6-8, 9-13. (Wise, Abegg, Cook 1994:350-76) The first section is badly fragmented, but seems to be centered on descriptions of the heavenly priests and their practices. The second section {{is concerned with the}} praises and blessings offered by the seven orders of angels, with the seventh song functioning as a peak of the series of thirteen. The final section <b>offers</b> <b>descriptions</b> of the heavenly temple, throne room, and throne (merkavah) of God.|$|E
50|$|In 1857, he {{published}} materials from his California travels in Harper's Weekly, in California Magazine, and the reminiscence of his adventures {{in a book}} called Three Years in California. This book, which <b>offers</b> <b>descriptions</b> on mining techniques, personal interactions, transportation, crime, holidays, hotels and restaurants, entertainment of the social life of the era {{and the growth of}} California. It focused on his experiences and encounters in gold camps such as Sacramento, Coloma, Nevada City, Placerville, Downieville, Jacksonville, San Andreas and Sonora. It {{is considered one of the}} most entertaining and accurate depictions of the early Gold Rush period, and remains one of the classic first-person accounts of the Age of Gold in America. Borthwick illustrated his book with eight of his own lithographs, depicting card games, dances, mining operations, and Chinese emigrants. His attention to detail and his engaging portrayals are considered one of the most realistic representations of the time. Between 1857 and his death in 1892, he resided in Paddington, London, England.|$|E

40|$|Narrow gap {{semiconductors}} {{obey the}} general rules of semiconductor science, but often exhibit extreme features of these rules {{because of the}} same properties that produce their narrow gaps. Consequently these materials provide sensitive tests of theory, and the opportunity {{for the design of}} innovative devices. Narrow gap semiconductors are the most important materials for the preparation of advanced modern infrared systems. Device Physics of Narrow Gap Semiconductors <b>offers</b> <b>descriptions</b> of the materials science and device physics of these unique materials. Topics covered include impurities and defects, recombination mechanisms, surface and interface properties, and the properties of low dimensional systems for infrared applications. This book will help readers to understand not only the semiconductor physics and materials science, but also how they relate to advanced opto-electronic devices. The last chapter applies the understanding of device physics to photoconductive detectors, photovoltaic infrared detectors, super lattices and quantum wells, infrared lasers, and single photon infrared detectors...|$|E
40|$|This paper explores a {{range of}} {{epistemological}} paradigms available to understand, interpret and semiotically depict young people. These paradigms all draw upon a metadiscourse of developmental age and stage (e. g. Hall 1914) and then work from particular epistemological views {{of the world to}} cast young people in different lights. Using strategic essentialism (Spivak 1996), the paper <b>offers</b> <b>descriptions</b> of four existing paradigms, including biomedical (Erikson 1980), psychological (e. g. Piaget 1973), critical (e. g. Giroux & MacLaren 1982) and postmodern (e. g. Kenway & Bullen 2001). While some of these paradigms have been more distinct in particular cultural, historical and political contexts, they have overlapped and informing each other. Each paradigm carries unique consequences for the role of the learner, the teacher and the curriculum. The paper explores contemporary manifestations of the paradigms. From this investigation, a potential new space using concepts of subjectivity (Grosz 1994) for conceptualising young people is offered...|$|E
40|$|The {{environment}} {{has not always}} been protected by law. It was not until the middle of the 20 th century that ‘the environment’ came to be understood as an entity in need of special care, and the law-politics duo firmly fixed its focus on this issue. In this book Wickham and Goodie tell the story of how law and politics first came upon the environment as an object in need of special attention. They outline the unlikely intersection of aesthetics and science that made ‘the environment’ into the matter of great concern it is today. The book describes the way private common-law strategies and public-law legislative strategies have approached the task of protecting the environment, and explore the greatest environmental challenge to have so far confronted environmental law and politics; the threat of global climate change. The book <b>offers</b> <b>descriptions</b> of many of the strategies being deployed to meet this challenge and present some troubling assessments of them. The book will be of great interest to students, teachers, and researchers of environmental law, socio-legal studies, environmental studies, and political theory...|$|E

30|$|The {{description}} of experimental devices is a thorny problem involving the trade-off between describing quantum systems with enough rigour and yet taking sufficient {{account of the}} disorder inherent to manufacturing processes. A first approach might therefore be to study the simplest case of interacting device components, namely two P-doped single monolayers (bilayers)[22, 23]. Given the computational limitations of ab initio modelling it is currently not possible to treat the disordered multi-layer system in full. Two approaches suggest themselves. In[23] the approach was to simplify the {{description of}} the delta-layer in order to study disorder through a mixed atom pseudopotentials approach. Here, we instead develop a rigorous model of an idealised, perfectly ordered multi-layer system in order to make connections to an understanding gleaned from both the mixed-atom approach and from other idealised models. The two approaches are complementary: alone, neither achieves a complete description, but together, they offer good comparisons from which one may draw the firmest conclusions available regarding experimental devices. The second approach, dwelt upon in this work, also <b>offers</b> <b>descriptions</b> of systems that should become available with improvements to the manufacturing processes mentioned above. As such, this is the focus of our discussion.|$|E

40|$|This is a {{qualitative}} study {{about how a}} family describes {{what it means to}} care for and provide schooling for a child orphaned due to HIV/AIDS. The study offers a perspective beyond the lens of a family through the inclusion of interview data from representatives of the Ivorian Ministry of Health, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) located in Côte d’Ivoire. Descriptive data reveal how care and schooling are nearly synonymous constructs in the family {{at the center of this}} study. To care for a child means to provide schooling. The form of care and schooling are ordered through practices linked to established matrilineal and ethnic family system practices. The child, orphaned due to HIV/AIDS, offers rich descriptive insights about how the loss of his parents affected his care needs, how he negotiated the matrilineal system and how he embraced school achievement and religion to manage his sense of loss and the stigma attached to his status as an orphaned child. This study also <b>offers</b> <b>descriptions</b> that explore the complexity of the political dynamics, support mechanisms, and psychosocial constructs that delineate care and schooling practices in this family and, more broadly, in Côte d’Ivoire.
