Rauschning also claimed that in Munich Hitler {{was found guilty of}} a violation of Paragraph 175, which dealt with pederasty. No evidence <b>of</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> these two charges has been found.|$|E

5|$|As in the {{original}} Tekken Tag Tournament, matches involve each player selecting two fighters to fight with. Players are able to switch their fighters out at any time, allowing the inactive character to gradually recover some life they might have lost. At certain points, an inactive character's life bar may flash, giving them a temporary boost in strength if they are tagged in. If the life bar <b>of</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> a player's fighters runs out, that player loses the round. If time runs out, the player who has the most cumulative life remaining amongst their fighters wins the round.|$|E

5|$|Shamrock Rovers wore {{green and}} white striped jerseys until 1926, when they adopted the {{green and white}} hooped strip that they have worn ever since. Their club badge has {{featured}} a football and a shamrock throughout their history. The club has a relatively large support base and shares an intense rivalry with Bohemian Football Club. On 26 August 2011 Rovers became the first Irish side to reach the group stages <b>of</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> the top two European competitions by beating Partizan Belgrade in the play-off round of the Europa League.|$|E
5|$|The {{inventories}} of both 1514 and 1546 also list several hundred heavy darts and lime pots {{that were designed}} to be thrown onto the deck of enemy ships from the fighting tops, although no physical evidence <b>of</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> these weapon types has been identified. Of the 50 handguns listed in the Anthony Roll, the complete stocks of five matchlock muskets and fragments of another eleven have been found. They had been manufactured mainly in Italy, with some originating from Germany. Found in storage were several gunshields, a rare type of firearm consisting of a wooden shield with a small gun fixed in the middle.|$|E

5|$|The second {{version of}} the project, {{tentatively}} called Chrono Trigger: Brink of Time then Chrono Resurrection, started development in April 2003. Lazur has given several reasons to explain his willingness to restart the project, including his experience coding for the Dreamcast Visual Memory Unit, programming for game developer DC Studios, and playing Chrono Cross, the official sequel to Chrono Trigger for PlayStation. Unlike CT64, the second version would be a short demo developed in a cross-platform engine with a single 3D playing mode. The Windows version was planned for a free Internet release, while Nintendo GameCube and Xbox ports would be reserved for official developers with access to development kits <b>of</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> the two consoles.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory of}} plate {{tectonics}} {{demonstrates that the}} continents of the Earth are moving across the surface {{at the rate of}} a few centimeters per year. This is expected to continue, causing the plates to relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within the planet and the presence of a hydrosphere. With the loss <b>of</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> these, continental drift will come to a halt. The production of heat through radiogenic processes is sufficient to maintain mantle convection and plate subduction {{for at least the next}} 1.1 billion years.|$|E
5|$|All {{humans have}} {{two copies of}} the Huntingtin gene (HTT), which codes for the protein Huntingtin (HTT). The gene is also called HD and IT15, which stands for 'interesting {{transcript}} 15'. Part of this gene is a repeated section called a trinucleotide repeat, which varies in length between individuals and may change length between generations. If the repeat is present in a healthy gene, a dynamic mutation may increase the repeat count and result in a defective gene. When the length of this repeated section reaches a certain threshold, it produces an altered form of the protein, called mutant Huntingtin protein (mHTT). The differing functions of these proteins are the cause of pathological changes which in turn cause the disease symptoms. The Huntington's disease mutation is genetically dominant and almost fully penetrant: mutation <b>of</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> a person's HTT alleles causes the disease. It is not inherited according to sex, but {{the length of the}} repeated section of the gene and hence its severity can be influenced by the sex of the affected parent.|$|E

5|$|Conventional fission {{power plants}} {{rely on the}} chain {{reaction}} caused when fission events release thermal neutrons that cause further fission events. Each fission event in U-235 releases two or three neutrons with about 2MeV of kinetic energy. By careful arrangement {{and the use of}} various absorber materials, designers can balance the system so one of those neutrons causes another fission event while the other one or two are lost. This balance is known as criticality. Natural uranium is a mix of three isotopes; mainly U-238, with some U-235, and trace amounts of U-234. The neutrons released in the fission <b>of</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> the main isotopes will cause fission in U-235, but not in U-238, which requires higher energies around 5MeV. There is not enough U-235 in natural uranium to reach criticality. Commercial light water nuclear reactors, the most prevalent power reactors in the world, use nuclear fuel containing uranium enriched to 3 to 5% U-235 while the leftover is U-238.|$|E
5|$|Echmarcach {{was the son}} of a {{man named}} Ragnall. Whilst Echmarcach bore a Gaelic name, the name of his father is {{ultimately}} derived from Old Norse, a fact that serves to exemplify the hybrid nature of the eleventh-century Irish Sea region, The identity of Echmarcach's father is uncertain. One possibility is that Ragnall was a member of the dynasty that ruled the Norse-Gaelic enclave of Waterford in tenth- and eleventh centuries. If so, Echmarcach may have been the son of one of two Waterfordian rulers: Ragnall mac Ímair, King of Waterford (died 1018), or this man's apparent son, Ragnall ua Ímair, King of Waterford (died 1035). Another possibility is that Echmarcach belonged to a family from the Isles, and that his father was Ragnall mac Gofraid, King of the Isles (died 1004/1005), son and possible successor of Gofraid mac Arailt, King of the Isles (died 989). As a descendant <b>of</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> the aforesaid families, Echmarcach would appear to have been a member of the Uí Ímair, a royal dynasty descended from the Scandinavian sea-king Ímar (died c.873).|$|E
