5|$|Another German philosopher, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, {{praised the}} {{ideas in the}} Upanishads, as did <b>others.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> United States, the group known as the Transcendentalists were {{influenced}} by the German idealists.

As a result of the influence of these writers, the Upanishads gained renown in Western countries.|$|E

50|$|The {{draw for}} the quarter-finals and beyond was held separately, after the {{conclusion}} of the round of 16. Because of the country protection rule, if there are two clubs from the same country, they will not face each <b>other</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quarter-finals. Therefore, the two clubs from Saudi Arabia may not be drawn with each <b>other</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quarter-finals. However, the same rule does not apply if there are more than two clubs from the country. Therefore, the four clubs from the Korea Republic may be drawn against each <b>other</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quarter-finals.|$|R

English, wrote that given the amount of pressure that all Allied commanders were under to break out from Normandy, Simonds probably had little choice in the decision he made.|$|E
