5|$|Benzodiazepines share {{a similar}} {{chemical}} structure, {{and their effects}} in humans are mainly produced by the allosteric modification <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> kind of neurotransmitter receptor, the GABAA receptor, which increases the overall conductance of these inhibitory channels; this results in the various therapeutic effects as well as adverse effects of benzodiazepines. Other less important mechanisms of action are also known.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the exact}} number of churches that existed in Visby during the Middle Ages is unknown, there were {{certainly}} more than in any other Swedish city, and at least twelve within the city walls. Visby grew to become an important trading port during the Middle Ages, and most of the churches in the city were built during the 12th and 13th centuries. The churches were not, as in the countryside, only parish churches. Some belonged to abbeys, almshouses or served groups of traders <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> nationality, such as the Russian Church or present-day Visby Cathedral, which was originally a church used by German traders.|$|E
5|$|Because {{norms for}} {{language}} use {{are shared by}} members <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic differences may become salient markers of divisions between social groups, for example, speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class, one's area of origin, or status {{as a second language}} speaker. These kinds of differences {{are not part of the}} linguistic system, but are an important part of how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1970, {{a series}} of {{expansions}} were added to Ainsworth's original patterns. They include the following: B4 (1970), A/C (1985) D/disorganized (1986), B5 (1988, 1992) A+, C+, & Depressed (1992, 2010). At later ages, additional categories have been described. Each of these patterns reflects {{a different kind of}} attachment relationship of the infant with the mother/caregiver. An infant may have a different pattern of attachment to each parent as well as to alternate caregivers. Pattern of attachment is thus {{not a part of the}} infant, but is characteristic of the protective and comforting quality <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> relationship. These attachment patterns are associated with behavioral patterns and can help further predict a child's future personality.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} can be {{seen from}} a variety of viewpoints. A synthesized research definition of cognitive flexibility is a switch in thinking, whether that is specifically based on a switch in rules or broadly based on a need to switch one’s previous beliefs or thoughts to new situations. Moreover, it refers to simultaneously considering multiple aspects of thought at once, whether they be two aspects <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> object, or many aspects of a complex situation. Other terms for and components of cognitive flexibility include mental flexibility, mental set shifting, cognitive shifting, task switching/shifting, and attention switching/shifting.|$|E

5|$|In 1887 Michelson {{proposed}} {{the use of}} optical interferometers for the measurement of length, work which contributed to him being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1907. In 1952 the CIPM {{proposed the}} use of wavelength <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> light source as the standard for defining length, and in 1960 the CGPM accepted this proposal using radiation corresponding to a transition between specified energy levels of the krypton 86 atom as the new standard for the metre. By 1975, when the second had been {{defined in terms of}} a physical phenomenon rather than the earth's rotation and Einstein's assertion that the speed of light was constant, the CGPM authorised the CIPM to investigate the use of the speed of light {{as the basis for the}} definition of the metre. This proposal was accepted in 1983.|$|E
5|$|In all {{butterflies}} (with {{the exception}} of male Euschemoninae) and in Bombycoidea moths (with {{the exception of}} the Sphingidae), there is no arrangement of frenulum and retinaculum to couple the wings. Instead, an enlarged humeral area of the hindwing is broadly overlapped by the forewing. Despite the absence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> mechanical connection, the wings overlap and operate in phase. The power stroke of the forewing pushes down the hindwing in unison. This type of coupling is a variation of frenate type but where the frenulum and retinaculum are completely lost.|$|E
5|$|In the Roman {{system of}} direct democracy, two primary types of gatherings {{were used to}} vote on legislative, electoral, and {{judicial}} matters. The first was the Assembly (comitia), which was a gathering that was deemed to represent the entire Roman people, {{even if it did}} not contain all of the Roman citizens or, like the comitia curiata, excluded a particular class of Roman citizens (the plebs). The second was the Council (concilium), which was a gathering of citizens <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> class. In contrast, the Convention was an unofficial forum for communication. Conventions were simply forums where Romans met for specific unofficial purposes, such as, for example, to hear a political speech. Voters always assembled first into Conventions to hear debates and conduct other business before voting, and then into Assemblies or Councils to actually vote.|$|E

5|$|Physiological enzyme {{inhibition}} {{can also be}} produced by specific protein inhibitors. This mechanism occurs in the pancreas, which synthesises many digestive precursor enzymes known as zymogens. Many of these are activated by the trypsin protease, so {{it is important to}} inhibit the activity of trypsin in the pancreas to prevent the organ from digesting itself. One way in which the activity of trypsin is controlled is the production <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> and potent trypsin inhibitor protein in the pancreas. This inhibitor binds tightly to trypsin, preventing the trypsin activity that would otherwise be detrimental to the organ. Although the trypsin inhibitor is a protein, it avoids being hydrolysed as a substrate by the protease by excluding water from trypsin's active site and destabilising the transition state. Other examples of physiological enzyme inhibitor proteins include the barstar inhibitor of the bacterial ribonuclease barnase and the inhibitors of protein phosphatases.|$|E
