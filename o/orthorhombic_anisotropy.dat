40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{minerals}} are stable is the Earth’s crust. Minerals belong {{to one of the}} seven crystal systems and have a {{wide range of}} densities. Hence, evaluating crustal seismic anisotropy is very complicated. Seismic anisotropy does not only depend on the types of minerals present, but rather considers mineral orientation, which is greatly dependent on the presence of Lattice Preferred Orientation (LPO), within a rock body. This study aims to investigate mineralogical role in rocks’ anisotropy and anisotropy symmetry. Hence, over 100 elastic tensors of crustal rocks was compiled from published studies from all over the world, along with the composition, pressure and temperature conditions of the rock samples. These compiled rock samples are representative of the rock types seen in the lower crust. The elastic tensors were decomposed into different symmetry classes and ηK was calculated for each rock sample. ηK measures the deviation from a perfectly elliptical hexagonal phase velocity. The total rock anisotropy of these samples ranges from 1. 27 % to 25. 47 %. Some rock samples dominantly have hexagonal symmetry, while others have orthorhombic and lower symmetry class. Higher amounts of mica in rock samples correlate to a higher hexagonal component of anisotropy. Similarly, rock samples with higher amphibole content tends to have a higher <b>orthorhombic</b> component of <b>anisotropy.</b> It is also shown that rock samples with higher anisotropy have lower ηK value, majority of which are below 1.

40|$|The {{determination}} of the exact position of the P-S conversion point (CP) {{is an important issue}} in converted-wave seismology. Frequently, this issue is approached considering that the rock formation is isotropic. This simple approach may lead to significant errors due to the anisotropic features of the subsurface. This paper presents a comparison between the position of the CP obtained from the isotropic solution and the position of the CP considering two types of anisotropy: the transversely isotropic medium with vertical axis of symmetry, the so-called VTI, and an orthorhombic medium. In order to determine the location of the CP, the modeling program ANRAY, based on ray tracing method, was used. It is shown that for the VTI case the discrepancy between the true position of the CP and the one found by assuming isotropy can be in the order of hundreds of meters, even for offset/depth ratio, (X/Z), less than 2. On the other hand, for some particular values of Thomsen's parameters Î and d, it can be demonstrated that, the position of the CP practically coincides with the isotropic case. For <b>orthorhombic</b> symmetry (azimuthal <b>anisotropy),</b> the CP, in general, is no longer located in the vertical plane defined by the source-receiver positions, i. e., the discrepancy between CP locations is expressed by an inline and an offline components.

The model is essentially similar to previous models such as introduced by Labonte [2, 3] : the magnetization configuration is assumed to be independent of the Z coordinate, parallel to the line and for each iteration loop, the torque acting on the magnetization at location (X,Y) is calculated. The magnetization is then allowed to rotate slightly under the action of that torque. After a sufficiently large number of iterations, the equilibrium configuration is obtained.

40|$|General {{reciprocity}} theorems for perturbed acoustic {{media are}} provided {{in the form of}} convolution- and correlation-type theorems. The results presented here differ from previous derivations because they provide explicit integral relations between wavefields and wavefield perturbations which alone do not satisfy the acoustic wave equations. Using Green’s functions to describe perturbed and unperturbed waves in two distinct wave states, representation theorems are derived from the reciprocity relations in perturbed media. While the convolution-type theorems can be manipulated to obtain the Lippmann-Schwinger integral, the correlation-type theorems can be used to retrieve the perturbation response of the medium by cross-correlations. By cross-correlating wavefield perturbations recorded at a given receiver with unperturbed waves at another, one obtains a pseudo-experiment where only wavefield perturbations propagate from one receiver to the other as if one of them were a source. This can be done when the pressure fluctuations arise from random volume sources; or from coherent excitation by surface sources when the receivers lie away from the perturbed portion of the medium. The perturbation-based integral equations presented here are particularly important for the description of scattering problems, and for reconstructing only field perturbations (e. g., scattered waves) from crosscorrelating measured field quantities.

The first part of our experiments was performed in the paramagnetic and spin-Peierls phases at 9. 5, 95, and 190 GHz. All nonmagnetic impurities (Si, Zn and Mg) were found to hardly affect the position and linewidth of the single line resonance, in spite of the moment formation due to the broken chains. In contrast to Si, Zn, and Mg dopings, the presence of Ni (S = 1) at low concentration induces a spectacular shift toward high fields of the ESR line (up to 40 % for x = 0. 002), together with a large broadening. This shift is strictly proportional to the ratio of Ni to Cu susceptibilities: Hence it is strongly enhanced below the spin-Peierls transition.

This departure from TI is due to the presence of amphibole, sillimanite, and quartz. Amphibole and sillimanite develop strong crystallographic preferred orientations with the fast c axes parallel to the lineation, forming <b>orthorhombic</b> <b>anisotropy</b> with V[p](X) >V[p](Y) >V[p](Z).

Specifically, with a combination made up of a velocity and particular dimensionless ratios of the elastic coefficients, the scattering potential of the anisotropic parameters have stationary scattering radiation patterns {{as a function of the}} type of anisotropy. With our new parametrization, the data is mainly sensitive to the scattering potential of 4 parameters: the horizontal velocity in the x direction, x, which provides scattering mainly near zero offset in the x vertical plane, εd, which is the ratio of the horizontal velocity squared in the x and x direction, and δ 3 describing the anellipticity in the horizontal plane. Since, with this parametrization, the radiation pattern for the horizontal velocity and ε is azimuth independent, we can perform an initial VTI inversion for these two parameters, and then use the other two parameters to fit the azimuth variation in the data. This can be done at the reservoir level or any region of the model. Including the transmission from reflections, the migration velocity analysis (MVA) component, into the picture, the multi azimuth surface seismic data are mainly sensitive to the long wavelength components of uh, δ 3, and εd through the diving waves, and η 1, ηd, and δ 3, in the transmission to or from reflectors (especially, in the presence of large offsets).

40|$|Orthorhombic {{anisotropic}} model inversion is extra challenging {{because of}} the multiple parameter nature of the inversion problem. The high number of parameters required to describe the medium exerts considerable trade-off and additional nonlinearity to a full-waveform inversion (FWI) application. Choosing a suitable set of parameters to describe the model and designing an effective inversion strategy can help in mitigating this problem. Using the Born approximation, which is the central ingredient of the FWI update process, we have derived radiation patterns for the different acoustic orthorhombic parameterizations. Analyzing the angular dependence of scattering (radiation patterns) of the parameters of different parameterizations starting with the often used Thomsen-Tsvankin parameterization, we have assessed the potential trade-off between the parameters and the resolution in describing the data and inverting for the parameters. The analysis led us to introduce new parameters ϵd, δd, and ηd, which have azimuthally dependent radiation patterns, but keep the scattering potential of the transversely isotropic parameters stationary with azimuth (azimuth independent). The novel parameters ϵd, δd, and ηd are dimensionless and represent a measure of deviation between the vertical planes in <b>orthorhombic</b> <b>anisotropy.</b> Therefore, these deviation parameters offer a new parameterization style for an acoustic orthorhombic medium described by six parameters: three vertical transversely isotropic (VTI) parameters, two deviation parameters, and one parameter describing the anisotropy in the horizontal symmetry plane. The main feature of any parameterization based on the deviation parameters, is the azimuthal independency of the modeled data {{with respect to the}} VTI parameters, which allowed us to propose practical inversion strategies based on our experience with the VTI parameters. This feature of the new parameterization style holds for even the long-wavelength components of the model constrained by traveltimes...|$|E
40|$|Seismic {{interferometry}} {{has become}} a technology of growing interest for imaging borehole seismic data. We demonstrate that interferometry of internal multiples {{can be used to}} image targets above a borehole receiver array. By “internal multiples” we refer to all types of waves that scatter multiple times inside the model. These include, for instance, interbed, intra-salt and water-bottom multiples; as well as conversions between these different kinds of multiples. We use an interferometry technique, based on representation theorems for perturbed media, that targets the reconstruction of specific primary reflections from multiply reflected waves. In this interferometry approach, we rely on shot-domain wavenumber separation to select the directions of waves arriving at a given receiver. Using a numerical walkaway VSP experiment recorded by a subsalt borehole receiver array in the Sigsbee salt model, we use the interference of internal multiples to image the salt structure from below. In this numerical example, the interferometric image that uses internal multiples reconstructs the bottom and top salt reflectors above the receiver array, as well as subsalt sediment structure between the array and the salt. Because of the limited source summation in this interferometry example, the interferometric images show artifact reflectors within the salt body. We apply this method to a field walkaway VSP from the Gulf of Mexico. With the field data, we demonstrate that the choice of shotdomain wavenumbers in the target-oriented interferometry procedure controls the wavenumbers in the output pseudo-shot gathers. Target-oriented interferometric imaging from the 20 -receiver array recovers the top of salt reflector that is consistent with surface seismic images. We present our results both with correlation- and deconvolution-based interferometry. This paper has been submitted to Geophysics.
