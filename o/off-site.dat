5|$|The {{certificate}} program {{consists of}} year-round crop production, course work in organic farming, practical training and management, and an <b>off-site</b> internship requirement.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to these concerns, DFS services implemented changes to improve the fairness and transparency of their contests, including entry limits, banning <b>off-site</b> scripts, identifying veteran-level players, allowing users to block players they {{do not wish to}} compete against, and adding beginner-level contests intended for new users.|$|E
5|$|Accommodation is {{provided}} for all undergraduates, {{and for some}} graduates, though some accommodation is <b>off-site.</b> Members are generally expected to dine in hall, where there are two sittings every evening, one informal and one formal, except on Saturdays, where there is only an informal sitting. The Bar, situated underneath the Hall, serves food from mid-morning and drinks in the evening. There is both a Junior Common Room (JCR), between Second and Third quad, and a Middle Common Room (MCR), on the Island Site.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the township, {{there were a number}} of temporary camps established for construction workers. It was initially intended that the construction workers should live <b>off-site,</b> but the poor condition of the roads and a shortage of accommodations in the area made commuting long and difficult, and in turn made it difficult to find and retain workers. Construction workers therefore came to be housed in large hutment and trailer camps. The largest, the trailer camp at Gamble Valley, had four thousand units. Another, at Happy Valley, held 15,000 people. The population of the construction camps declined as the construction effort tapered off, but they continued to be occupied in 1946.|$|E
5|$|The fourth copy, {{owned by}} Salisbury Cathedral, was first given in 1215 to its predecessor, Old Sarum Cathedral. Rediscovered by the cathedral in 1812, it has {{remained}} in Salisbury throughout its history, except when being taken <b>off-site</b> for restoration work. It is possibly the best preserved of the four, although small pin holes {{can be seen in}} the parchment from where it was once pinned up. The handwriting on this version is different from that of the other three, suggesting that it was not written by a royal scribe but rather by a member of the cathedral staff, who then had it exemplified by the royal court.|$|E
5|$|The {{spandrel}} {{plates were}} welded to the columns {{to create the}} modular pieces <b>off-site</b> at the fabrication shop. The modular pieces were typically 52inches (1.3m) deep, and extended for two full floors and half of two more floors. Adjacent modules were bolted together, with the splices occurring at mid-span of the columns and spandrels. The spandrel plates were located at each floor, transmitting shear stress between columns, allowing them {{to work together in}} resisting lateral loads. The joints between modules were staggered vertically, so the column splices between adjacent modules were not at the same floor.|$|E
5|$|The {{visual arts}} program {{includes}} drawing, painting, photography, sculpting, digital art, and art history. The program is highly structured, emphasizing technique {{and control over}} free expression, which has attracted criticism from the local art community. Art students receive individualized instruction, participate in art exhibits and competitions, undertake commissioned work, and work at in-house galleries and <b>off-site</b> exhibits. Most art majors take Advanced Placement art courses {{by the end of}} their sophomore year, and many attend pre-college programs at major universities between their high school years.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1943, it {{had become}} clear that the initial {{estimates}} {{of the size of}} the town had been too low, and a second phase of construction was required. Plans now called for a town of 42,000 people. Work began in the fall of 1943, and continued into the late summer of 1944. Hospitals were expanded, as were the police and fire services, and the telephone system. Only 4,793 of a planned total of 6,000 family houses were built, mostly on the East Town area and the undeveloped stretch along State Route 61. They were supplemented by 55 new dormitories, 2,089 trailers, 391 hutments, a cantonment area of 84 hutments and 42 barracks. Some 2,823 of the family units were prefabricated <b>off-site.</b> The high school was expanded to cater for 1,000 students. Two additional primary schools were built, and existing ones were expanded so that they could accommodate 7,000 students.|$|E
5|$|Since GNOME 3.2 Web allows {{creating}} application launchers for web applications. The subsequent {{invocation of}} a launcher {{brings up a}} plain single instance of Web limited to one domain, with <b>off-site</b> links opening in a normal browser. The launcher created this way is accessible from the desktop and {{is not limited to}} GNOME Shell. For instance it may be used with Unity, used on Ubuntu. This feature facilitates the integration of the desktop and World Wide Web, which is a goal of Web's developers. Similar features {{can be found in the}} Windows version of Google Chrome. For the same purpose Mozilla Foundation previously developed a standalone application Mozilla Prism, which was superseded by the project Chromeless.|$|E
5|$|Sporting {{competitions}} {{have always}} provided entertainment for crowds. To distinguish the {{players from the}} audience, the latter are often known as spectators. Developments in stadium and auditorium design, {{as well as in}} recording and broadcast technology, have allowed <b>off-site</b> spectators to watch sport, with the result that the size of the audience has grown ever larger and spectator sport has become increasingly popular. Two of the most popular sports with global appeal are association football and cricket. Their ultimate international competitions, the World Cup and test cricket, are broadcast around the world. Beyond the very large numbers involved in playing these sports, they are notable for being a major source of entertainment for many millions of non-players worldwide. A comparable multi-stage, long-form sport with global appeal is the Tour de France, unusual in that it takes place outside of special stadia, being run instead in the countryside.|$|E
5|$|Ex situ {{research}} (or <b>off-site</b> research) is also {{popular among}} researchers looking {{to answer questions}} {{that are difficult to}} test in the field. For example, efforts to sequence the genome of the gray mouse lemur will help researchers understand which genetic traits set primates apart from other mammals and will ultimately help understand what genomic traits set humans apart from other primates. One of the foremost lemur research facilities is the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in Durham, North Carolina. It maintains the largest captive lemur population outside of Madagascar, which it maintains for non-invasive research and captive breeding. Many important research projects have been carried out there, including studies of lemur vocalizations, basic locomotor research, the kinematics of bipedalism, the effects of social complexity transitive reasoning, and cognition studies involving a lemur's ability to organize and retrieve sequences from memory. Other facilities, such as the Lemur Conservation Foundation, located near Myakka City, Florida, have also hosted research projects, such as one that looked at lemurs' ability to preferentially select tools based on functional qualities.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 Jarre {{released}} Revolutions. The album spans several genres, including symphonic industrial, Arabian inspired, light guitar pop {{and ethnic}} electro jazz. A two-hour concert called Destination Docklands was planned for September 1988, {{to be held}} at the Royal Victoria Dock in east London. Close to the heart of London, the location was chosen in part for its desolate environment, but also because Jarre thought the architecture was ideally suited for his music. Early in 1988 Jarre met with local officials and members of the community, but Newham Borough Council expressed their fears about the event's safety and delayed their decision on whether to allow the concert to proceed until 12 September eventually rejecting the licence application. The local fire service were also concerned about access {{in the event of a}} fire. Site work continued as Jarre's team searched for alternative locations in which to stage the concert, but following improvements to both on and <b>off-site</b> safety Jarre eventually won conditional approval on 28 September to stage two separate performances, on the 8 and 9 October.|$|E
5|$|It was {{initially}} intended that the construction workers should live <b>off-site,</b> but the poor {{condition of the}} roads and a shortage of accommodations in the area made commuting long and difficult, and in turn {{made it difficult to}} find and retain workers. Construction workers therefore came to be housed in large hutment and trailer camps. The J. A. Jones camp for K-25 workers, known as Happy Valley, held 15,000 people. This required 8 dormitories, 17 barracks, 1,590 hutments, 1,153 trailers and 100 Victory Houses. A pumping station was built to supply drinking water from the Clinch River, along with a water treatment plant. Amenities included a school, eight cafeterias, a bakery, theater, three recreation halls, a warehouse and a cold storage plant. Ford, Bacon & Davis established a smaller camp for 2,100 people. Responsibility for the camps was transferred to the Roane-Anderson Company on 25 January 1946, and the school was transferred to district control in March 1946.|$|E
5|$|The Gallery’s lack {{of space}} {{remained}} acute in this period. In 1845 a large bequest of British paintings {{was made by}} Robert Vernon; there was insufficient room in the Wilkins building so these were displayed first in Vernon’s town house at No. 50 Pall Mall and then at Marlborough House. The Gallery was even less well equipped for its next major bequest, as J. M. W. Turner was to bequeath the entire contents of his studio, excepting unfinished works, to the nation upon his death in 1851. The first 20 of these were displayed <b>off-site</b> in Marlborough House in 1856. Ralph Nicholson Wornum the Gallery's Keeper and Secretary, worked with John Ruskin to bring the bequest together. The stipulation in Turner's will that two of his paintings be displayed alongside works by Claude is still honoured in Room 15 of the Gallery, but his bequest has never been adequately displayed in its entirety; today the works are divided between Trafalgar Square and the Clore Gallery, a small purpose-built extension to the Tate completed in 1985.|$|E
5|$|The {{implications}} of crop diversity are at {{both local and}} world levels. Global organizations that aim to support diversity include Bioversity International (formerly known as International Plant Genetic Resources Institute), the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, the Borlaug Global Rust Initiative, and the International Network for Improvement of Banana and Plantain. Members of the United Nations, at the World Summit on Sustainable Development 2002 at Johannesburg, said that crop diversity {{is in danger of}} being lost if measures are not taken. One such step taken in the action against the loss of biodiversity among crops is gene banking. There are a number of organizations that enlist teams of local farmers to grow native varieties, particularly those that are threatened by extinction due to lack of modern-day use. There are also local, national and international efforts to preserve agricultural genetic resources through <b>off-site</b> methods such as seed and sperm banks for further research and crop breeding.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{buildings}} in the new World Trade Center complex, One World Trade Center includes sustainable architecture features. Much of the building's structure and interior is built from recycled materials, including gypsum boards and ceiling tiles; around 80percent of the tower's waste products are recycled. Although the roof area of any tower is limited, the building implements a rainwater collection and recycling scheme for its cooling systems. The building's PureCell phosphoric acid fuel cells generate 4.8megawatts (MW) of power, and its waste steam generates electricity. The New York Power Authority selected UTC Power to provide the tower's fuel cell system, {{which was one of}} the largest fuel cell installations in the world once completed. The tower also makes use of <b>off-site</b> hydroelectric and wind power. The windows are made of an ultra-clear glass, which allows maximum sunlight to pass through; the interior lighting is equipped with dimmers that automatically dim the lights on sunny days, reducing energy costs. Like all of the new facilities at the World Trade Center site, One World Trade Center is heated by steam, with limited oil or natural gas utilities on-site. One World Trade Center is expected to receive a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold Certification, making it one of the most environmentally sustainable skyscrapers in the world.|$|E

25|$|The {{building}} system boundary is split into a physical boundary which determines which renewable resources are considered (e.g. in buildings footprint, on-site or even <b>off-site,</b> see) respectively how many buildings {{are included in}} the balance (single building, cluster of buildings) and a balance boundary which determines the included energy uses (e.g. heating, cooling, ventilation, hot water, lighting, appliances, IT, central services, electric vehicles, and embodied energy, etc.). It should be noticed that renewable energy supply options can be prioritized (e.g. by transportation or conversion effort, availability over the lifetime of the building or replication potential for future, etc.) and therefore create a hierarchy. It may be argued that resources within the building footprint or on-site should be given priority over <b>off-site</b> supply options.|$|E
