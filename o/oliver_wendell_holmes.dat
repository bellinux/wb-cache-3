6000|$|In {{company with}} Nasby Clemens, that season, also met <b>Oliver</b> <b>Wendell</b> [...] <b>Holmes.</b> Later {{he had sent}} Holmes {{a copy of his}} book and {{received}} a [...] pleasantly appreciative reply. [...] "I always like," [...] wrote Holmes, [...] "to [...] hear what one of my fellow countrymen, who is not a Hebrew scholar, [...] or a reader of hiero-glyphics, but a good-humored traveler with a [...] pair of sharp, twinkling Yankee (in the broader sense) eyes in his [...] head, has to say about the things that learned travelers often make [...] unintelligible, and sentimental ones ridiculous or absurd.... I [...] hope your booksellers will sell a hundred thousand copies of your [...] travels." [...] A wish that was realized in due time, though it is [...] doubtful if Doctor Holmes or any one else at the moment believed [...] that a book of that nature and price (it was $3.50 a copy) would [...] ever reach such a sale.|$|R
5000|$|Bellows {{had evidently}} {{inherited}} his father's intellectual energy, developing a {{particular interest in}} Philology; and as his business thrived during the 1860s he entered into scholarly correspondences with contemporary intellectuals including the philologist Max Müller, after whom Bellows would later name his eldest son, Max. [...] Another correspondent was the fellow polymath <b>Oliver</b> <b>Wendell</b> Holmes: the exchanges with <b>Wendell</b> <b>Holmes</b> would continue for twenty-five years. Bellows also found time to master French: another of his correspondents was the late emperor's philologist nephew, Lucien Bonaparte.|$|R

5|$|In one of {{his last}} acts as governor, he {{appointed}} <b>Oliver</b> <b>Wendell</b> <b>Holmes,</b> Jr. to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. The lame duck appointment was occasioned by the sudden resignation of Otis Lord, a Republican who may have resigned in order to deny the appointment opportunity to the incoming Democratic Governor, Benjamin Butler. The appointment was made on December 8, 1882, the last day of Long's term when the Governor's Council (which had to approve the appointment) was scheduled to meet.|$|E
5|$|On June 15, 1840, Holmes married Amelia Lee Jackson at King's Chapel in Boston. She was the {{daughter}} of the Hon. Charles Jackson, formerly Associate Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, and the niece of James Jackson, the physician with whom Holmes had studied. Judge Jackson gave the couple a house at 8 Montgomery Place, which would be their home for eighteen years. They had three children: Civil War officer and American jurist <b>Oliver</b> <b>Wendell</b> <b>Holmes</b> Jr. (1841–1935), Amelia Jackson Holmes (1843–1889), and Edward Jackson Holmes (1846–1884).|$|E

5|$|Three United States Supreme Court {{decisions}} in 1919 each upheld convictions under laws against {{certain kinds of}} anti-war speech. In 1919, the Court upheld the conviction of Socialist Party leader Charles Schenck for publishing anti-war literature. In Debs v. United States, the court upheld the conviction of Eugene Debs. While the Court upheld a conviction a third time in Abrams v. United States, Justice <b>Oliver</b> <b>Wendell</b> <b>Holmes</b> wrote an important dissent which has gradually been absorbed as an American principle: he urged the court to treat freedom of speech as a fundamental right, which should rarely be restricted.|$|E
5|$|Walker {{was born}} in Boston, Massachusetts, the {{youngest}} son of Hanna (née Ambrose) and Amasa Walker, a prominent economist and state politician. The Walkers had three children, Emma (born 1835), Robert (born 1837), and Francis. Because the Walkers' next-door neighbor was <b>Oliver</b> <b>Wendell</b> <b>Holmes,</b> Sr., the junior Walker and junior Holmes were playmates as young children and renewed their friendship later in life. The family moved from Boston to North Brookfield, Massachusetts, in 1843 and remained there. As a boy he had both a noted temper {{as well as a}} magnetic personality.|$|E
5|$|Willis {{was very}} sick in these final years: he {{suffered}} from violent epileptic seizures and, early in November 1866, fainted in the streets, prompting Harriet Jacobs to return to help his wife. Willis died on his sixty-first birthday, January 20, 1867, and was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Four days later, {{the day of his}} funeral, all bookstores in the city were closed as a token of respect. His pallbearers included Longfellow, James Russell Lowell, <b>Oliver</b> <b>Wendell</b> <b>Holmes,</b> Samuel Gridley Howe, and James Thomas Fields.|$|E

5|$|Debs appealed his {{conviction}} to the Supreme Court. In its ruling on Debs v. United States, the court examined several statements Debs had made regarding World War I and socialism. While Debs had carefully worded his speeches {{in an attempt}} to comply with the Espionage Act, the Court found he had the intention and effect of obstructing the draft and military recruitment. Among other things, the Court cited Debs' praise for those imprisoned for obstructing the draft. Justice <b>Oliver</b> <b>Wendell</b> <b>Holmes,</b> Jr. stated in his opinion that little attention was needed since Debs' case was essentially {{the same as that of}} Schenck v. United States, in which the Court had upheld a similar conviction.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, Boston was {{the site}} of the National Peace Jubilee, a massive gala to honor {{veterans}} and to celebrate the return of peace. Conceived by composer Patrick Gilmore, who had served in an army band, the celebration was held in a colossal arena in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood designed to hold 100,000 attendees and specifically built for the occasion. A new hymn was commissioned for the occasion, written by <b>Oliver</b> <b>Wendell</b> <b>Holmes</b> Sr. and set to American Hymn by Matthais Keller. Spanning five days, the event featured a chorus of nearly 11,000 and an orchestra of more than 500 musicians. It was the largest musical gathering on the continent up to that time.|$|E
5|$|Several justices {{have become}} widowers {{while on the}} bench. The 1792 death of Elizabeth Rutledge, wife of Justice John Rutledge, contributed to the mental health {{problems}} {{that led to the}} rejection of his recess appointment. Roger B. Taney survived his wife, Anne, by twenty years. <b>Oliver</b> <b>Wendell</b> <b>Holmes,</b> Jr. resolutely continued working on the Court for several years {{after the death of his}} wife. William Rehnquist was a widower for the last fourteen years of his service on the Court, his wife Natalie having died on October 17, 1991 after suffering from ovarian cancer. With the death of Martin D. Ginsburg in June 2010, Ruth Bader Ginsburg became the first woman to be widowed while serving on the Court.|$|E

5|$|Smith's {{departure}} {{provided for}} a period of expansion, both among the faculty and the student body. Former students of Nathan Smith's replaced him on the faculty, drawing medical professionals in the northeast such as <b>Oliver</b> <b>Wendell</b> <b>Holmes,</b> Sr. to join them. The first hospital at the school was founded by DMS alumnus Dixi Crosby in 1838, who used it to integrate academic instruction with hands-on patient care. In 1870, Carlton Pennington Frost, DMS '57, replaced Crosby as Dean of the school. Under Frost, the curriculum sustained another revamping, this time into a four-year program that included clinical and academic training. Frost also presided over the establishment of Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital in 1893, built to replace Crosby's defunct hospital.|$|E
5|$|Augustus Willson {{was born}} on October 13, 1846 in Maysville, Kentucky, the second child of Hiram and Ann Colvin (née Ennis) Willson. A year {{following}} his birth, his father moved the family to Covington. In 1852, the family moved again, this time to New Albany, Indiana. In 1856, Willson's mother died. Three years later, his father also died, leaving him an orphan at age twelve. He and his younger sister {{went to live with}} their grandmother in Allegany County, New York. Willson then moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts to live with his brother Forceythe, a poet of some renown. There, he was exposed to men of letters such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, <b>Oliver</b> <b>Wendell</b> <b>Holmes,</b> and James Russell Lowell.|$|E
5|$|In 1866, {{at the age}} of 29, {{he became}} a fellow of the Linnean Society under the {{sponsorship}} of Charles Darwin, James Veitch, David Moore, and seven other distinguished botanists and horticulturists. Two months later, he left Regents Park to write for The Gardener's Chronicle and The Times, and represented the leading horticultural firm of Veitch at the 1867 Paris Exhibition. He began writing many of his publications, beginning with Gleanings from French Gardens in 1868, The Parks, Gardens, and Promenades of Paris in 1869, and Alpine Flowers for Gardens and The Wild Garden in 1870. In 1871 he launched his own gardening journal, simply named , which over the years included contributions from notables such as John Ruskin, <b>Oliver</b> <b>Wendell</b> <b>Holmes,</b> Gertrude Jekyll, William Morris, Dean Hole, Canon Ellacombe, and James Britten.|$|E

5|$|In 1860, Edward {{undertook}} {{the first}} tour of North America by a Prince of Wales. His genial good humour and confident bonhomie made the tour a great success. He inaugurated the Victoria Bridge, Montreal, across the St Lawrence River, {{and laid the}} cornerstone of Parliament Hill, Ottawa. He watched Charles Blondin traverse Niagara Falls by highwire, and stayed for three days with President James Buchanan at the White House. Buchanan accompanied the Prince to Mount Vernon, to pay his respects at the tomb of George Washington. Vast crowds greeted him everywhere. He met Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson and <b>Oliver</b> <b>Wendell</b> <b>Holmes.</b> Prayers for the royal family were said in Trinity Church, New York, {{for the first time}} since 1776. The four-month tour throughout Canada and the United States considerably boosted Edward's confidence and self-esteem, and had many diplomatic benefits for Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Longfellow {{oversaw the}} {{creation}} of a formal garden and his wife oversaw decorating the interior. Mrs. Longfellow purchased several items from Tiffany's in New York as well as $350 worth of carpets. They installed central heating in 1850 and gaslight in 1853. During their time in the house, the Longfellows hosted famous artists, writers, politicians and other luminaries who were attracted to Longfellow's hospitality and fame. Specific visitors included Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray, singer Jenny Lind, and actress Fanny Kemble. Dom Pedro II, Emperor of Brazil also visited the house privately and requested the company of Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson, <b>Oliver</b> <b>Wendell</b> <b>Holmes,</b> Sr., and James Russell Lowell. Mr. and Mrs. Longfellow also raised their three daughters and two sons in the home. Longfellow and his wife stayed in the home until their respective deaths but spent their summers after 1850 in Nahant, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|The {{most egregious}} episode during the Red Summer was a vicious attack on blacks in Elaine, Arkansas, in which nearly 200 blacks were murdered. Reports {{coming out of}} the South blamed the blacks, alleging that they were conspiring to take over the government. Infuriated with the distortions, Du Bois {{published}} a letter in the New York World, claiming that the only crime the black sharecroppers had committed was daring to challenge their white landlords by hiring an attorney to investigate contractual irregularities.The sharecroppers were working with the Progressive Farmers and Household Union of America. Over 60 of the surviving blacks were arrested and tried for conspiracy, in the case known as Moore v. Dempsey. Du Bois rallied blacks across America to raise funds for the legal defense, which, six years later, resulted in a Supreme Court victory authored by <b>Oliver</b> <b>Wendell</b> <b>Holmes.</b> Although the victory had little immediate impact on justice for blacks in the South, it marked the first time the Federal government used the 14th amendment guarantee of due process to prevent states from shielding mob violence.|$|E
