5|$|The Halo {{universe}} was first adapted into the graphic novel format in 2006, {{with the release}} of The Halo Graphic Novel, a collection of four short stories. It was written and illustrated by graphic novelists Lee Hammock, Jay Faerber, Tsutomu Nihei, Brett Lewis, Simon Bisley, Ed Lee and Jean Giraud. At the 2007 New York Comic Con, Marvel Comics announced they would be working <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>ongoing</b> Halo series with Brian Michael Bendis and Alex Maleev. The limited series, titled , bridges the gap between the events of Halo2 and Halo3; initially planned to conclude shortly before the release of Halo 3, the constant delays led to the final issue being published April 2009.|$|E
5|$|The Imperfect {{portrays the}} verb as an {{incomplete}} action {{along with the}} process by which it came about, either as an event that has not begun, an event that has begun but is still in the process, or a habitual or cyclic action that is <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>ongoing</b> repetition. The Imperfect can also express modal or conditional verbs, as well as commands in the Jussive and Cohortative moods. While often future tense, it also has uses in the past and present under certain contexts. Biblical Hebrew tense is not necessarily reflected in the verb forms per se, but rather is determined primarily by context. The Participles also reflect ongoing or continuous actions, but are also subject to the context determining their tense.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} eLabBench – a {{tabletop}} system supporting ex-perimental {{research in the}} biology laboratory. The eLabBench allows biologists to organize their experiments around the notions of activities and resources, and seamlessly roam in-formation between their office computer and the digital labo-ratory bench. At the bench, biologists can pull digital re-sources, annotate them, and interact with hybrid (tangible + digital) objects such as racks of test tubes. This paper fo-cuses on the eLabBench’s design, and presents three main contributions: First, based on observations we highlight a set of characteristics digital benches should support in a labora-tory. Second, we describe the eLabBench, including a simple implementation of activity-based computing for tabletop en-vironments, with support for activity roaming, note-taking, and hybrid objects. Third, we present preliminary feedback of the eLabBench based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>ongoing</b> deployment in <b>a</b> bio-logy laboratory, and propose a design space definition {{for the design of}} single-user, work-oriented, tabletop systems.

40|$|Abstract. We {{analyze the}} large-distance {{behaviour}} of static quark-anti-quark pair correlations in QCD. The singlet free energy is calculated and the entropy contribution {{to it is}} identified allowing us to calculate the excess internal energy. The free energy has {{a sharp drop in}} the critical region, leading to sharp peaks in both excess entropy and internal energy. PACS numbers: 11. 15. Ha, 11. 10. Wx, 12. 38. Mh, 25. 75. Nq 1. Static quark anti-quark free energies Among its many other applications, finite temperature lattice QCD is a useful tool to study the modification of quark-anti-quark forces n a hot medium. Recent progress in large-scale simulations allowed us to address this problem in QCD with realistic quark masses. This study is based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>ongoing</b> RBC-Bielefeld joint research effort which is fully described in Ref. [2]. Here we will note that calculations are performed at physical strange quark mass and two light quark masses mq = 0. 1 ms and 0. 2 ms, with ms being the strange quark mass; two cutoffs, corresponding to temporal extent Nt = 4, 6 were used...|$|R
