5|$|Across {{the county}} line in Lake Luzerne, NY9N begins {{to deviate from}} the Hudson River, {{gradually}} curving to the northeast as it passes through the hamlets <b>of</b> <b>Lake</b> Luzerne, Fourth Lake, and Lake Vanare, {{all of which are}} named for small lakes bearing those names {{near the center of the}} communities. Just northeast <b>of</b> <b>Lake</b> Vanare, NY9N enters the town <b>of</b> <b>Lake</b> George, where it connects to I-87 (the Adirondack Northway) at exit21 and meets US9. Here, it joins its parent route northward toward the village <b>of</b> <b>Lake</b> George. The conjoined routes intersect the northern end of NY9L just south of the village line before becoming Canada Street and entering the village limits upon crossing over West Brook. US9 and NY9N serve as the primary north–south thoroughfare through the village before splitting at the north end of the village. While US9 continues to the north, NY9N heads northeast along the western edge <b>of</b> <b>Lake</b> George.|$|E
5|$|After {{passing the}} {{community}} of Rockhurst, the route intersects Assembly Point Road, another local road serving a minor peninsula and Assembly Point on its tip. Past this point, NY9L tightly parallels the southern shore <b>of</b> <b>Lake</b> George southwest into the town <b>of</b> <b>Lake</b> George. The route {{comes to an end}} at a junction with US9 and NY9N south of the village <b>of</b> <b>Lake</b> George at the southwestern extent of the lake.|$|E

5|$|Lake Tauca is one {{of several}} ancient lakes which formed in the Altiplano. Other known lakes are Lake Escara, Ouki, Salinas, Lake Minchin, Inca Huasi and Sajsi, in {{addition}} to several water-level rises <b>of</b> <b>Lake</b> Titicaca. The identity of these lakes is controversial; Sajsi is often considered part <b>of</b> <b>Lake</b> Tauca, and the lake is frequently divided into an earlier (Ticaña) and a later (Coipasa) phase.|$|E
5|$|Much of NY9N runs {{alongside}} {{either a}} river or a lake. It follows the Hudson River through northern Saratoga County and southern Warren County, the entirety <b>of</b> <b>Lake</b> George's western shoreline, the west edge <b>of</b> <b>Lake</b> Champlain between Ticonderoga and Westport, and the Ausable River from Keene to Keeseville. The other portions of NY9N pass through predominantly rural and mountainous {{regions of the}} Adirondack Mountains.|$|E

5|$|A pattern <b>of</b> <b>lake</b> cycles {{becoming}} {{longer than}} the preceding one has been noted. Water from the lake {{may have contributed to}} increased oxygen-18 at Sajama around 14,300 years ago, possibly triggered by evaporation. As the lake level dropped, Lake Poopó would have been disconnected first; the sill separating it from the rest <b>of</b> <b>Lake</b> Tauca is relatively shallow. Coipasa and Uyuni would have remained connected until later. Water levels in Lake Titicaca's Lake Huinaimarca were low by 14,200 BP.|$|E
5|$|As of 2004, the Aliso Creek {{watershed}} had {{a population}} of 149,087. Nine communities were established in the creek's watershed as it {{was developed in the}} 20th century. By 2001 seven of them had become cities (from mouth to source, Laguna Beach, Laguna Niguel, Aliso Viejo, Laguna Hills, Laguna Woods, Lake Forest, and Mission Viejo), and the last two, Foothill Ranch and Portola Hills, were incorporated into the city <b>of</b> <b>Lake</b> Forest in 2000. The largest urban area in the basin is in the middle, where Interstate 5 bisects the watershed east to west. The northern boundary of this urban area stretches a little beyond California State Route 241 and the southern boundary is near California State Route 73 in the south. This area consists primarily <b>of</b> <b>Lake</b> Forest, Laguna Woods, and Laguna Hills.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1800, the armies of France and Austria faced {{each other across the}} Rhine. Pál Kray led approximately 120,000 troops. In addition to his Austrian regulars, his force included 12,000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria, 6,000 troops from the Duchy of Württemberg, 5,000 soldiers of low quality from the Archbishopric of Mainz, and 7,000 militiamen from the County of Tyrol. Of these, 25,000 men were deployed east <b>of</b> <b>Lake</b> Constance (Bodensee) to protect the Vorarlberg. Kray posted his main body of 95,000 soldiers in the L-shaped angle where the Rhine changes direction from a westward flow along the northern border of Switzerland to a northward flow along the eastern border of France. Unwisely, Kray set up his main magazine at Stockach, near the northwestern end <b>of</b> <b>Lake</b> Constance, only a day's march from French-held Switzerland.|$|E

50|$|On the northwest, Lake Lulu is {{bordered by}} the Chain <b>of</b> <b>Lakes</b> Complex. Part <b>of</b> {{this is the}} Chain <b>of</b> <b>Lakes</b> Park, {{which is on the}} south portion of the Chain <b>of</b> <b>Lakes</b> Complex. The entire south end of the complex {{consists}} of baseball fields. The Chain <b>of</b> <b>Lakes</b> Park is one particular baseball stadium that was built in 1966 to serve as the Boston Red Sox spring training facility. It was renovated in 1993 and the Cleveland Indians used the stadium for spring training until 2009. This stadium, located 225 ft from the lake's shore, is no longer used for spring training.|$|R
50|$|Fish River {{flows into}} the south end <b>of</b> Saint Froid <b>Lake</b> 10 mi {{downstream}} <b>of</b> Portage <b>Lake.</b> Saint Froid Lake is almost entirely in Winterville Plantation.

5|$|Because the {{territorial}} boundary {{line between the}} U.S. and British North America (specifically, the province of Quebec until 1791 and Upper Canada thereafter) ran through the middle <b>of</b> <b>Lake</b> Erie and then up the Detroit River, combined with the prevailing belief regarding {{the location of the}} southern tip <b>of</b> <b>Lake</b> Michigan, the framers of the 1802 Ohio Constitution believed it was the intent of Congress that Ohio's northern boundary should certainly be north of the mouth of the Maumee River, and possibly even of the Detroit River. Ohio would thus be granted access to most or all of the Lake Erie shoreline west of Pennsylvania, and any other new states carved out of the Northwest Territory would have access to the Great Lakes via Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Superior.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{dissolving}} in the water, {{oxygen and}} other gases {{are trapped in}} a type of structure called a clathrate.

5|$|During the {{campaign}} to conquer the Itza of Petén, the Spanish sent expeditions to harass and relocate the Mopan north <b>of</b> <b>Lake</b> Izabal and the Ch'ol Maya of the Amatique forests to the east. They were resettled on the south shore of the lake. By {{the latter half of}} the 18th century, the local inhabitants consisted entirely of Spaniards, mulattos and others of mixed race, all associated with the Castillo de San Felipe de Lara fort guarding the entrance to Lake Izabal. There was a drastic depopulation <b>of</b> <b>Lake</b> Izabal and the Motagua Delta due to constant slave raids by the Miskito Sambu of the Caribbean coast that effectively ended the Maya population of the region; the captured Maya were sold into slavery in the British colony of Jamaica.|$|E
