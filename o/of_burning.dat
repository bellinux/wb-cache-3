An irrigation ditch has also been dug to provide drainage to the surrounding farmland.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{was also}} {{susceptible}} to intense heat, which would {{cause it to}} crack and collapse. Byzantine sources recorded the demolition of stone structures caused by placing clay pots <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> charcoal {{at the base of}} walls moistened with vinegar or urine, and the 6th century treatise by an engineer in Justinian's army includes the lighting fires beneath the walls amongst its instructions for sieges.|$|E

5|$|A strong smell <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> {{was present}} in the Lords' {{chambers}} during the afternoon of 16 October, and at 4:00pm two gentlemen tourists visiting to see the Armada tapestries that hung there were unable to view them properly because of the thick smoke. As they approached Black Rod's box {{in the corner of}} the room, they felt heat from the floor coming through their boots. Shortly after 4:00pm Cross and Furlong finished work, put the last few sticks into the furnaces—closing the doors as they did so—and left to go to the nearby Star and Garter public house.|$|E
5|$|Development <b>of</b> <b>Burning</b> Rangers started around November 1996, {{after the}} release of Sonic Team's {{previous}} game Christmas Nights (a Christmas-themed demo for Nights into Dreams...). The concept originated with the idea of rescuing people as opposed to killing them, which was an element that producer Yuji Naka felt was too common in contemporary video games. The development team of 31 (out of Sonic Team's staff of about 50) was directed by Naoto Ohshima, the director and lead designer Takao Miyoshi. The rest of the team consisted of three game planners, six programmers, eighteen designers, and two sound producers, most of whom had worked on Nights into Dreams....|$|E
5|$|Tentative {{evidence}} supports {{an increased risk}} of lung cancer from indoor air pollution related to the burning of wood, charcoal, dung or crop residue for cooking and heating. Women who are exposed to indoor coal smoke have about twice the risk and a number of the by-products <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> biomass are known or suspected carcinogens. This risk affects about 2.4billion people globally, and is believed to account for 1.5% of lung cancer deaths.|$|E

5|$|The first {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt to}} escape the prison was made on April 27, 1936 by Joseph Bowers, who was assigned the duty <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> trash at the incinerator. He tried to escape during duty hours by scaling a chain link fence {{at the edge of}} the island. When he was caught in this act and refused orders of the correctional officer located at the West Road guard tower to come down he was shot. He was seriously injured in the fall from over 15m (50ft) and consequently died.|$|E

5|$|A {{flexible-fuel vehicle}} (FFV) or dual-fuel vehicle (colloquially called a flex-fuel vehicle) is an {{alternative}} fuel vehicle with an internal combustion engine designed to run {{on more than one}} fuel, usually gasoline blended with either ethanol or methanol fuel, and both fuels are stored in the same common tank. Modern flex-fuel engines are capable <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> any proportion of the resulting blend in the combustion chamber as fuel injection and spark timing are adjusted automatically according to the actual blend detected by a fuel composition sensor. Flex-fuel vehicles are distinguished from bi-fuel vehicles, where two fuels are stored in separate tanks and the engine runs on one fuel at a time, for example, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), or hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Although Curtis was {{personally}} opposed to British possession of Gibraltar, he took command of a marine unit during the siege, {{and in the}} attack by Spanish gunboats and floating batteries in September 1782, Curtis took his men into the harbour in small boats to engage the enemy. During this operation, Curtis witnessed {{the destruction of the}} batteries by British fireships and was able to rescue hundreds of burnt and drowning Spanish sailors from the water. This rescue effort was carried out in close proximity to the enemy force and in constant danger from the detonation <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> Spanish ships, which showered his overcrowded boats with debris and caused several casualties amongst his crews. When Lord Howe relieved the siege, he brought the much-celebrated Curtis back to Britain, where he was knighted for his service and became a society figure, featuring in many newspaper prints. He came under attack however from Lieutenant Campbell, who published a pamphlet accusing him of indecision and a lack of nerve during his time in Brilliant.|$|E
5|$|As {{the player}} {{progresses}} throughout the game, two additional ships become available for use. Each of the game's three ships offers a different balance of speed, weapons, and maneuverability. Within the levels, the player may collect power-ups that enhance the ship's weaponry. Weapons are categorized into three different types: primary weapons, secondary weapons, and countermeasures. Primary weapons {{range from a}} variety of laser weapons to the Plasma Cannon and the Napalm Cannon, which projects a stream <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> fuel. Secondary weapons include different types of missiles, while countermeasures range from proximity mines to portable turrets. Most primary weapons consume energy in different rate, but some, such as the Napalm Cannon, use their own type of ammunition. In contrast, all secondary weapons and countermeasures require their own ammunition suppliers.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{disagreement}} with Harrington (who subsequently formed the Third Way), and objections over {{the direction the}} party was heading, in 1989, Griffin left the National Front. Along with Holland and Fiore, he helped form the International Third Position (ITP), a development of the Political Soldier movement, but left the organisation in 1990. In the same year, he lost his left eye when a discarded shotgun cartridge exploded in a pile <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> wood, since when he has worn a glass eye. The accident left him unable to work, and owing to other financial problems he subsequently petitioned for bankruptcy (the accident occurred in France, where he later lost money in a failed business project). For several years thereafter, he abstained from politics and was supported financially by his parents. He later stewarded a public Holocaust denial meeting hosted by David Irving.|$|E
5|$|Madonna {{lies down}} on a pew and has a dream in which she is falling through space. Suddenly, a woman, {{representing}} power and strength, catches her. She advises Madonna {{to do what is}} right and tosses her back up. Still dreaming, Madonna returns to the statue, which transforms into the black man she had seen earlier. He kisses her forehead and leaves the church as she picks up a knife and cuts her hands, bleeding. Interspersing scenes show Madonna singing and dancing wildly in front <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> crosses, erotic scenes between her and the saint, and the singer being surrounded by a choir inside the church. Madonna wakes up, goes to the jail and tells the police that she had witnessed the crime and that the black man is innocent; the police release him. The video ends as Madonna dances in front of the burning crosses, and then everybody involved in the story line takes a bow as curtains come down on the set.|$|E
5|$|Montejo garrisoned Xelha with 40 {{soldiers}} and posted 20 more at nearby Pole. Xelha was renamed Salamanca de Xelha {{and became the}} first Spanish settlement in the peninsula. The provisions were soon exhausted and additional food was requisitioned from the local Maya villagers; this too was soon consumed. Many local Maya fled into the forest and Spanish raiding parties scoured the surrounding area for food, finding little. With discontent growing among his men, Montejo took the drastic step <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> his ships; this strengthened the resolve of his troops, who gradually acclimatised to the harsh conditions of Yucatán. Montejo was able to get more food from the still-friendly Aj Nuam Pat of Cozumel. Montejo took 125 men and set out on an expedition to explore the north-eastern portion of the Yucatán peninsula. At Belma, Montejo gathered the leaders of the nearby Maya towns and instructed them to swear loyalty to the Spanish Crown. After this, Montejo led his men to Conil, a town in Ekab, where the Spanish party halted for two months.|$|E

25|$|According to the Mishnah, the {{ceremony}} <b>of</b> the <b>burning</b> <b>of</b> the red heifer itself {{took place on}} the Mount of Olives. A ritually pure kohen slaughtered the heifer, and sprinkled of its blood {{in the direction of the}} Temple seven times. The Red Heifer was then burnt on a pyre, together with crimson dyed wool, hyssop, and cedar wood. In recent years, the site <b>of</b> the <b>burning</b> <b>of</b> the Red Heifer on the Mount of Olives has been tentatively located by archaeologist Yonatan Adler.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the association of}} the intensity of newspaper reporting <b>of</b> charcoal <b>burning</b> suicide with the incidence of such deaths in Taiwan during 1998 - 2002. A counting process approach was used to estimate the incidence of suicides and intensity of news reporting. Conditional Poisson generalized linear autoregressive models were performed to assess the association of the intensity of newspaper reporting <b>of</b> charcoal <b>burning</b> and non-charcoal burning suicides with the actual number <b>of</b> charcoal <b>burning</b> and non-charcoal burning suicides the following day. We found that increases in the reporting <b>of</b> charcoal <b>burning</b> suicide were associated with increases in the incidence <b>of</b> charcoal <b>burning</b> suicide on the following day, with each reported charcoal burning news item being associated with a 16 % increase in next day charcoal burning suicide (p<. 0001). However, the reporting of other methods of suicide {{was not related to}} their incidence. We conclude that extensive media reporting <b>of</b> charcoal <b>burning</b> suicides appears to have contributed to the rapid rise in the incidence of the novel method in Taiwan during the initial stage of the suicide epidemic. Regulating media reporting of novel suicide methods may prevent an epidemic spread of such new methods...|$|R
