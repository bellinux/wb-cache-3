5|$|In 1983, he {{was picked}} by New York Governor Mario Cuomo to chair a {{scientific}} fact-finding commission on the Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant, a job that required him {{to find common ground}} between the many viewpoints represented on the commission. The commission eventually recommended the closure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant,</b> a course he personally disagreed with. Cuomo had formed the commission in mid-May 1983 to provide him with recommendations regarding the plant's safety, the adequacy of emergency plans, and the economics of operating the plant. The commission's consensus recommendations included unanimous findings that no emergency evacuation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> could be conducted without the cooperation of Suffolk County, which was refusing to approve an evacuation plan; that the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> would have been prevented if it had been started after new Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations were put into effect after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979; and that operating the plant would not reduce utility costs. Marburger himself at the time emphasized that the governor had not been seeking a consensus but rather encouraged multiple viewpoints to be reflected, and characterized the consensus conclusions as not the only important section of the report.|$|E
5|$|Now {{following}} the Wayneâ€“Macomb county line, M-102 separates Warren from Detroit. The highway also runs parallel to, {{and about a}} half mile (0.8km) north of Outer Drive, the original beltway highway proposed in 1918 to encircle Detroit. The road passes the Mound Road Engine facility, a former Chrysler plant next to the Mound Road intersection. East <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant,</b> the highway crosses a branch line of the Conrail Shared Assets Operations {{on the east side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> complex before intersecting M-53 (Van Dyke Road). Further east, 8Mile Road passes north of the Bel Air Center Shopping Center before crossing another Canadian National Railway line next to the intersection with M-97 (Groesbeck Highway).|$|E

5|$|The {{plant was}} laid out roughly north to south {{orientation}} along the Thames River. The plant itself {{is a mixture of}} interconnected buildings and stand-alone structures. The stand-alone structures included three propane sheds (Buildings 63, 64 and 65) that were located near the Human Resources building (Building 86) and its storage shed (Building 30). The main structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> was a string of connecting buildings that were erected and integrated into the production and operation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant.</b> At the north end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> was the Research and Development building (Building 87), it was located connected to two large storage buildings (Building 1 and 2). On the front of Building 2 was the main offices (Building 85). Building 2 is connected to the largest building, the Manufacturing Building (Building 3), which is connected to the Manufacturing Glass House (Building 5) and Glass House 2 (Building 32). Building 32 also served as storage building. Connected to Building 5 is the Glass House Cullet & Mix House (Number 7) and the Compressor & Auxiliary Generator building (Number 9) at the southern end.|$|E
5|$|Upgrading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> {{occurred}} several times. The Kesteven and Holland engines were overhauled in 1881 and 1883 respectively. Flow {{into the}} wheel pits was restricted by {{the provision of}} shuttles, and rising breasts were fitted on the outflow, so that the height at which the water was discharged could be varied as the water level in Vernatt's drain varied. Five new boilers, which could supply either engine, were fitted in 1883, and {{had been replaced by}} five more some time before 1928, for the new boilers failed in that year. The Kesteven engine had its scoop wheel removed, although the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> was not scrapped until 1952.|$|E

50|$|These plants harness {{an array}} of fungal {{symbionts}} across several families, often simultaneously. Analysis of these plants have identified Inocybe species as exclusive symbionts for 75% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> in habitat, {{as well as others}} (Hebeloma, Xerocomus, Lactarius and Thelephora). <b>The</b> <b>plants</b> also host ascomycete endophytes, which appear to assist <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> in parasitizing some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant's</b> basidiomycete symbionts.|$|R
5|$|About 100 {{separate}} {{stations for}} box huckleberry {{have been documented}} in the scientific literature. By the time of Baird's collection in 1845, the West Virginia stations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> had been lost to science, and his Pennsylvania colony {{was the only one}} known for some time. Specimens of box huckleberry were subsequently identified in Delaware in 1870, by William M. Canby.|$|E
5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum largely reproduces asexually by {{branching}} {{rather than}} sexually through spores. While wind-blown spores {{can result in}} sexual reproduction for the species, most spores probably fall within a relatively short radius <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant.</b> In addition, reproduction through spore dispersal requires the spore to land in suitable conditions for generating a gametophyte, typically in bright sunlight on thin serpentine soils. These requirements allow A.viridimontanum to colonize recently disturbed sites on ultramafic outcrops, where bedrock has been exposed and competing plants have been removed. The populations appear stable, with the long life of individuals compensating for low recruitment rates.|$|E
5|$|All {{members of}} Cicuta except C.bulbifera contain {{high levels of}} the {{poisonous}} principle cicutoxin, an unsaturated aliphatic alcohol that is structurally {{closely related to the}} toxin oenanthotoxin found in the plant hemlock water dropwort. Cicutoxin is present at all stages of growth and in all parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant,</b> but is most concentrated in the roots which appear to be the most toxic in the early spring. Its primary toxic effect is to act as a stimulant in the central nervous system. It is a non-competitive gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor antagonist. Cicutoxin acts on the GABAA receptor causing a block of the chloride channel which results in neuronal depolarization. In the presence of cicutoxin this depolarization continues unabated causing cell overactivity. The hyperactivity in brain cells results in seizures. Cicutoxin is highly poisonous and water hemlock is considered one of North America's most toxic plants. Ingestion of Cicuta can be fatal in humans and there are reports in the medical literature of severe poisoning and death as early as 1670. A number of people have also died following ingestion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> in the 20th and 21st century.|$|E

5|$|As well as plant based poisons, {{there are}} others that are made {{that are based on}} animals. For example, the larva or pupae of a beetle genus of the Northern Kalahari Desert is used to create a {{slow-acting}} poison that can be quite useful when hunting. The beetle itself is applied to the arrow head, by squeezing the contents of the beetle right onto the head. Plant sap is then mixed and serves as an adhesive. However, instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> sap, a powder made from the dead, eviscerated larva can be used.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the {{concession}} was given construction of the railway had already started. At the most 2,000 workers {{were involved in the}} construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant,</b> the Rjukan Line, and the Tinnoset Line. This was in addition to the Svelgfoss Power Station and a new potassium nitrate factory in Notodden. During the construction one worker lost his life in a landslide, while two survived the accident. Housing was provided in simple barracks, and few laborers came with family. Prostitution and the sale of illegal liquor during the prohibition flourished; the lack of proper law enforcement making Vestfjorddalen known as a lawless valley.|$|E

5|$|Following hatching, larvae {{feed on the}} {{reproductive}} structures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> and usually develop through four to six instars. Initially, the young larva feed together, and this stage is their most destructive stage. Through maturation, older larvae become aggressive and cannibalistic, leaving one or two larvae per feeding site (See Interfamilial Predation). They usually have orange heads, black thorax plates, and a body color that is primarily black. Their bodies can also be brown, pink, green, and yellow with many thorny microspines. Mature larvae migrate to the soil, where they pupate for 12 to 16 days.|$|E

5|$|From {{the point}} of view of physics, spirals are lowest-energy {{configurations}} which emerge spontaneously through self-organizing processes in dynamic systems. From {{the point of}} view of chemistry, a spiral can be generated by a reaction-diffusion process, involving both activation and inhibition. Phyllotaxis is controlled by proteins that manipulate the concentration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> hormone auxin, which activates meristem growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the stem. From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for photosynthesis.|$|E
