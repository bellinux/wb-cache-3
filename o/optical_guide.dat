40|$|In {{this thesis}} two {{previously}} separate {{fields of study}} are brought together: optical micromanipulation and ultrashort laser research. Here, the benefits of combining the high peak powers of ultrashort pulsed lasers and conventional optical micromanipulation techniques are explored. As optical trapping has been studied extensively, {{the focus of this}} research is on <b>optical</b> <b>guiding.</b> Moreover, the emphasis is on the use of Bessel beams as these have been shown to offer greater guiding distances than comparable Gaussian beams. The studies within this thesis show that <b>optical</b> <b>guiding</b> in Bessel and Gaussian beams is governed by the average power of the laser. However, the benefits of guiding with ultrashort pulsed lasers to exploit multi-photon processes become evident as the demonstration of simultaneous <b>optical</b> <b>guiding</b> and second harmonic generation in microscopic nonlinear crystal fragments is detailed. This work is developed by using ultrashort pulses to induce two-photon excitation-induced fluorescence in the guiding medium. This allows direct visualisation of the beam-particle interaction and measurement of the reconstruction of the Bessel beam around an object. Some studies using two-photon excitation to investigate Bessel beam penetration through turbid media are discussed. Finally, the work is concluded by exploring the use of pulsed white-light lasers in <b>optical</b> <b>guiding.</b> The wavelength-dependent propagation and reconstruction properties of the white-light Bessel beam are studied before some preliminary <b>optical</b> <b>guiding</b> experiments are discussed. From this, the broad bandwidth of the supercontinuum source is found to offer extended guiding distances in Gaussian beams thereby negating the need for Bessel beams.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the fabrication and {{the properties of}} five new semiconductor laser diode structures. All of these devices were grown from the GaAs-AlGaAs ternary system using the liquid phase epitaxial technique. In addition, a new low noise avalanche photodetector is proposed. The first example is a new technique for fabricating cleaved mirrors without cleaving through the substrate. This technique, called micro-cleavage, has potential applications for both opto-electronic integrated circuits and for the fabrication of short cavity length lasers. In this technique, cantilevers are formed by a sequence of etching steps. These cantilevers are subsequently cleaved using ultrasonic vibrations. Three devices related to high power single mode lasers are described. The first {{of these is the}} large optical cavity buried heterostructure window laser. The output power of semiconductor lasers, particularly during pulsed operation is limited by catastrophic mirror damage which occurs at power densities above a pulse width dependent damage threshold. The damage occurs due to local heating up to the melting point of the active region {{in the vicinity of the}} cleaved mirror facets. However, catastrophic mirror damage can be avoided by isolating the active layer from the cleaved mirrors, as is done in these window lasers. The second device related to high power that is described is the Inverted Strip Buried Heterostructure laser. These lasers combine many of the best features of both the buried <b>optical</b> <b>guide</b> lasers and the strip buried heterostructure that have been previously developed elsewhere. The inverted strip buried heterostructure lasers have significantly better beam quality than buried <b>optical</b> <b>guide</b> lasers and can be operated in the fundamental spatial mode for larger emitting areas (and therefore greater output power). The third device related to high power lasers is a variation of a buried heterostructure laser in which the injected current is confined to a narrow section in the center of the active layer. The optical gain is therefore also confined to a narrow section in the center of the active layer. By doing so the fundamental mode is much better matched to the optical gain than the higher order spatial modes. The result is that fundamental mode operation is possible for buried heterostructure lasers with active layer widths up to 8 µm. When the current is injected uniformly into the active layer, fundamental mode operation is possible only for active layer widths less than 2 µm. In addition to the descriptions of these devices a theoretical chapter on high power single mode lasers is included. The final laser structure that is described is a single liquid phase epitaxial growth laser structure in which the current is restricted to flow between two narrow stripes located above and below the active layer. This structure, which is fabricated using a meltback-growth technique allows the current injection to be restricted to a very narrow section of the active layer, which results in several interesting properties which are described and explained using a simple model. The final subject of this thesis is a multilayer avalanche photodetector (APD) which has been proposed for low noise applications. The noise generated by an APD is dependent on the statistics of the carrier multiplication process, since positive feedback effects, which exist when both electrons and holes produce secondary pairs, can greatly amplify any current fluctuations. Significantly more noise is generated if the electron and hole ionization rates ([alpha],[beta]) are equal than if only one carrier produces secondary pairs. The multilayer structure described and analyzed in this chapter is expected to have impact ionization which is dominated by electrons and therefore would be of importance for low noise applications. </p...|$|E

A monolithic NaI(Tl) scintillator commonly used for conventional PMT-based gamma cameras has been chosen for this study. SiPMs will be coupled with the scintillator via an <b>optical</b> <b>guide.</b> To cover scintillator surface thousands of SiPMs are required, together with multichannel front-end electronics.

The results of series of experiments determining the characteristics of MBE growth over patterned substrates are presented. Temperature and flux ratio dependence of faceting during MBE growth over patterned substrates is shown for temperatures ranging from 580 ° C to 700 ° C and for As/Ga flux ratios from 1. 4 : 1 to 4 : 1, and surface diffusion lengths for gallium are measured.

40|$|Although the {{terahertz}} domain {{has been}} explored scientifically, components, especially sources, {{are needed to}} enable further exploration of the frequency range. A photomixer generates coherent THz radiation through optical heterodyne down-conversion. A terahertz-frequency beat signal on an optical carrier illuminates an ultrafast photoconductor, modulating the conductance. The time-varying conductance together with a constant voltage bias generates time-varying current at the beat frequency. Low-temperature-grown gallium arsenide (LTG-GaAs) is the photoconductive material of choice, because its short carrier lifetime allows the conductance to be efficiently modulated at THz frequencies. The distributed photomixer described in this thesis is a new style of LTG-GaAs photomixer which uses an optical waveguide to couple the beat signal to an active area whichis large relative to the terahertz wavelength. This large, traveling-wave mode active area distributes the heat load from absorbed optical power and ohmic heating from photocurrent and avoids the RC rolloff associated with a lumped-element photomixer's intrinsic capacitance and the load resistance. The distributed photomixer structure consists of coplanar strips (CPS) fabricated {{on top of a}} dielectric strip-loaded waveguide that guides the optical beat. (cont.) The conductance of a thin layer of LTG-GaAs between the CPS and <b>optical</b> <b>guide</b> is modulated by the weakly coupled optical signal. The THz conductance wave between the dc-biased CPS creates a THz electromagnetic wave which propagates along the CPS. To velocity match the THz and optical waves, the CPS are periodically loaded with thin electrodes that add a small shunt capacitance to the line. The CPS are terminated in a planar antenna that radiates the THz wave. This thesis describes the design, fabrication, and testing of waveguide-coupled distributed photomixers. The photomixers demonstrated in this thesis operated in travelingwave mode and produced 100 nW of power at 0. 3 THz and the power output rolled off at 6 dB/octave until 1. 4 THz.
