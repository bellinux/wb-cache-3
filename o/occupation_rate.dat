2500|$|Amsterdam {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular tourist {{destinations}} in Europe, receiving more than 4.63million international visitors annually, this is excluding the 16 million day trippers visiting the city every year. The number of visitors has been growing steadily over the past decade. This can be attributed to an increasing number of European visitors. Two-thirds of the hotels are located in the city's centre. Hotels with 4 or 5 stars contribute 42% of the total beds available and 41% of the overnight stays in Amsterdam. The room <b>occupation</b> <b>rate</b> was 78% in 2006, up from 70% in 2005. The majority of tourists (74%) originate from Europe. The largest group of non-European visitors come from the United States, accounting for 14% of the total. Certain years have a theme in Amsterdam to attract extra tourists. For example, the year 2006 was designated [...] "Rembrandt 400", to celebrate the 400th birthday of Rembrandt van Rijn. Some hotels offer special arrangements or activities during these years. The average number of guests per year staying at the four campsites around the city range from 12,000 to 65,000.|$|E

Taking the coalfields of Britain as a historical testbed, techniques of linear and binomial logistic regression were used to assess the association between meningococcal meningitis <b>rates</b> and male <b>occupation</b> <b>rates</b> for coal mining in England and Wales during the national epidemic of 1931 – 32 and in its aftermath. Adjusting for the epidemiological effects of age, residential density, recent changes in the number of families, housing stock and low social class, the analysis yielded evidence of a significant and positive association between coal mining <b>occupation</b> <b>rates</b> and notified levels of meningitis activity in the epidemic period. Communities in areas of the world that currently maintain substantial deep coal extraction industries may be at increased risk for the epidemic transmission of meningococcal meningitis...|$|R

3000|$|The Colombian {{labour market}} {{is fraught with}} {{regional}} differences. While these disparities might not be particular to Colombia, their intensity and persistence over time is quite significant (Arango et al. 2013). Labour market outcomes such as participation, <b>occupation,</b> and unemployment <b>rates</b> show geographic disparities well above 10 % points across cities. National unemployment rates 1 (11.9 %) are unevenly registered, ranging from 7.6 % (in Bucaramanga) to 16 % (in Quibdó).

40|$|Abstract In {{temperate}} areas, {{we tend to}} see an {{advancement of}} spring as the global climate is changing {{at a rate that}} may be hard for long distance migrant birds to track. Caterpillars are the most common prey type for pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) nestlings, and the abundance of this food source peaks later with increasing altitude. Thus, I expected birds that settle at higher altitudes to have better synchronized their offspring’s need with food abundance. One aim {{of this study was to}} see if pied flycatchers had higher <b>occupation</b> <b>rates</b> and breeding success with increasing altitude, and if so, was this correlated to aversion to/competition with tits? I also wanted to see if the adverse effects of spells of bad weather had stronger impact if it occurred early in the nestling phase. During the spring and summer of 2009, I conducted a field study in the Dæli forest on the outskirts of Oslo, Norway. The study area had about 500 available nest boxes, in which pied flycatchers bred in 54 of them. In the present study, I examined the effects of altitude, laying dates and bad weather on breeding performance (clutch size, hatching-, fledging- and nesting success, number of young fledged and fledgling body mass). My results showed no difference in breeding success with altitude; however, one indication of pied flycatchers preferring to breed high in the terrain was the higher <b>occupation</b> <b>rates</b> of nest boxes in these areas. It may be that there are phenological advantages in relation to nutrition higher above sea level, or, the higher <b>occupation</b> <b>rates</b> might be a result of less competition with tits for nest boxes and food. Even in years with no apparent mistiming between breeding and the caterpillar peak, chicks’ survival chances are strongly reduced when they are exposed to extreme rainfall early in the nestling phase. This one-year study is to be treated as preliminary, and further studies are needed...|$|R
