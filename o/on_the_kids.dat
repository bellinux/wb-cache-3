5|$|After {{tying up}} Ms. Botz, the kids find all their {{telephones}} disabled (which Ms. Botz had done earlier) {{and go to}} a nearby payphone to alert the authorities. Meanwhile, Marge tries to call home to check up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> but because there is no answer, she and Homer decide to cancel their motel reservation and go home. They find Ms. Botz bound and gagged in front of the TV. Homer, thinking his children have gotten the best of another babysitter and unaware of her true identity, frees her and pays her handsomely. After advising Homer to keep both eyes on Bart, Ms. Botz makes a clean getaway, just seconds before the kids arrive with the police and news media to arrest her. As Bart tries to lead the police to the house, Homer attempts to berate him for his behavior towards Ms. Botz, only to be informed by a news reporter about Ms. Botz's true identity and that he just freed her. Realizing his mistake, a humiliated Homer attempts to save face by claiming he fought Botz and she escaped, then warning her on camera never to show her face to him again. Later that night, Homer moans about his blunder on TV, but Marge cheers him up by saying that if he raised three children who can hogtie a perfect stranger, he must be doing something right.|$|E

25|$|When I saw Going My Way I was as {{moved as}} they were by the {{character}} he played. Father O'Malley handled that gang of young hooligans in his parish with such kindness and wisdom that I thought he was wonderful too. Instead of coming down hard <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> and withdrawing his affection, he forgave them their misdeeds, {{took them to the}} ball game and picture show, taught them how to sing. By the last reel, the sheer persistence of his goodness had transformed even the worst of them into solid citizens. Then the lights came on and the movie was over.

25|$|Red Alert {{was one of}} the Autobots who {{originally}} came to Earth with Optimus Prime. His character was serious and extremely quiet. Almost nothing and nobody could make him to lose patience excepting Hot Shot who Red Alert often vainly asked to help him in his never-ending 'housekeeping' job on the Autobots' base. He was a brave and experienced warrior during the Cybertronian war, so that Optimus Prime himself gave him his due. But when on Earth, Red Alert hadn't many chances to show his fighting skill because his principal duty turned out to stay on the A-Base and to keep an eye <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> (Rad, Carlos and Alexis) while the other 'Bots sought the Mini-Cons or fought the Decepticons. He acted mainly as the Autobots' chief supply manager, engineer and doctor, and was primarily responsible for rebuilding Smokescreen into Hoist, when the latter's body was nearly melted away after Megatron had fired the Requiem Blaster at him.|$|E
