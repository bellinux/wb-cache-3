40|$|A {{shifting}} {{process from}} School-Based Curriculum {{that has been}} implemented since 2006 into Curriculum 2013 gave some impacts into the way assessing students, especially for young learners. This shifting urges a need of implementing an <b>on-going</b> <b>assessment</b> {{as a way to}} measure students’ ability rather than using traditional paper-pencil testing. This study examined the presence of learning support provided by <b>on-going</b> <b>assessment</b> and also challenges in implementing <b>on-going</b> <b>assessment</b> among 31 of third grade students in a private elementary school in Bandung. A qualitative analysis found that on-going assessments for EYL which were implemented through picture-cued description, information exchange, matching activity and written product provided support for learning. The supports were in the forms of repetition and opportunity to say the words in model of language use during the learning, students’ participations which indicated the building process of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and the occurrence of student’s autonomy and responsibility in the development for their further learning. The study also found that size of the class and classroom management became the main challenges in implementing <b>on-going</b> <b>assessment</b> in the classroom.

However, there is a dearth of literature describing task shifting in sub-Saharan Africa, where services for antiretroviral therapy (ART) have scaled up rapidly {{in the face of}} generalized human resource crises. As part of ART services expansion in Lusaka, Zambia, we implemented a comprehensive task-shifting program among existing health providers and community-based workers. Training begins with didactic sessions targeting specialized skill sets. This is followed by an intensive period of practical mentorship, where providers are paired with trainers before working independently. We provide <b>on-going</b> quality <b>assessment</b> using key indicators of clinical care quality at each site. Program performance is reviewed with clinic-based staff quarterly. When problems are identified, clinic staff members design and implement specific interventions to address targeted areas. From 2005 to 2007, we trained 516 health providers in adult HIV treatment; 270 in pediatric HIV treatment; 341 in adherence counseling; 91 in a specialty nurse "triage" course, and 93 in an intensive clinical mentorship program. <b>On-going</b> quality <b>assessment</b> demonstrated improvement across clinical care quality indicators, despite rapidly growing patient volumes.

40|$|Despite {{a lot of}} {{research}} has been conducted on issues surrounding class size, there is still no conclusive statement about class size. Most of the research about large classes indicates that large class setting has a negative influence on learning and teaching in the classroom. However, the research is conducted based on teacher survey data by educators and teachers. There are few students??? reflections shown and analyzed in the research. This case study attempts to fill the gap by analyzing student???s reflections. This study examines the structure and factors promoting the success of English 130 P classes at California State University, Chico. With the data from surveys and interviews, the design of small spaces in the large class is very important. There are two forms of small space: workshop and small group. These small spaces create small-class experience in a large class context for students. Students are well-supported in these small spaces. Mentors, peers and the instructor are important supporters in the class. Mentors are emphasized in this study as great supporters. With mentors??? help and leadership, small spaces can provide efficient help for students. Besides, the following positive factors are identified in the English 130 P classes: workshop, small group, mentors, technology, peers, activities, etc. This case study suggests that large class is doable with appropriate strategies and structure. In large classes, students can have great learning experience when they are supported well.

To understand {{the usefulness of}} comparing results from repeat assessments and to determine if targeted training supported improvements, this paper details comparison of assessment results of conducting 17 repeat laboratory assessments between 2009 and 2013. MethodsLaboratory assessments were conducted by SMEs in 17 laboratories (16 countries). We reviewed the quantitative assessment results of the laboratories that conducted both an initial and follow up assessment between 2009 to 2013 using repeated measures of Anova, (Mixed procedure of SAS (9. 3)). Additionally, we compared the overall summary scores and the assessor recommendations from the two assessments. ResultsWe were able to document a statistically significant improvement {{between the first and}} second assessments both on an aggregate as well as individual indicator score. Within the international capacity tool three of the eight categories recorded statistically significant improvement (equipment, management, and QA/QC), while the other tool categories (molecular, NIC, specimen, safety and virology) showed improvement in scores although not statistically significant. ConclusionsWe found that using a standardized tool and quantitative framework is useful for documenting capacity and performance improvement in identified areas over time. The use of the tool and standard reports with assessor recommendations assisted laboratories with establishing, maintaining, and improving influenza laboratory practices. <b>On-going</b> <b>assessments</b> and the consistent application of the analytic framework over time will continue to aid in building a measurement knowledge base for laboratory capacity.
