Later, {{in an effort to}} save the historic property, two young Nashville entrepreneurs (Jim Chandler and Gary Ganick) obtained a zoning change for the property. Then, condominiums were built <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>lawns</b> and <b>the</b> house was converted into an office.|$|R

5|$|Much of the {{existing}} landscaping <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>lawn</b> {{was carried out by}} Bishop George Henry Law in the 1820s. This included the incorporation of the remains of the roofless great hall and the construction of a raised rampart around the inside of the wall accessible from one of the towers. Bishop Law also created a grotto which he used to display fossils from Banwell Caves which were also part of his estate. A range of tress and shrubs were planted including: a black walnut, Lebanon cedar, catalpa and ginkgo. In the 1830s, Bishop Law had a pool created next to the springs. This acts as a mirror on a still day providing reflections of the east end of the cathedral in the water.|$|E

In 2007, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was one of those invited to speak on campus. Ahmadinejad accepted his invitation and spoke on September 24, 2007, as part of Columbia University's World Leaders Forum. The invitation proved to be highly controversial. Hundreds of demonstrators swarmed the campus on September 24 and the speech itself was televised worldwide. University President Lee C. Bollinger tried to allay the controversy by letting Ahmadenijad speak, but with a negative introduction (given personally by Bollinger). This did not mollify those who were displeased {{with the fact that the}} Iranian leader had been invited onto the campus.

50|$|Hugh Lowther was {{the last}} {{resident}} of Lowther Castle. His brother Lancelot the 6th Earl inherited the estate in 1944 but because of Hugh’s large debts was forced to sell many of the family’s treasures. A large auction sale was held in 1947. Lancelot died in 1953 and was succeeded by James his grandson. James wished to develop the estates and concentrated on farming. He saw Lowther Castle as an extravagance. After he returned from the World War II he said “it was a place that exemplified gross imperial decadence {{during a period of}} abject poverty. The army had damaged the grounds and buildings during the war and the castle had been empty for many years. James offered the Castle as a gift to three local authorities but all refused. At that time the only options for large country houses were to open them to the public or demolish them. He could not afford the former so he was forced to demolish the property. He left the shell of the castle intact as a silhouette.
