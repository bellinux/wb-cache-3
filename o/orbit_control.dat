40|$|Aiming {{to ensure}} the {{stability}} of the spacecraft with multiuncertainties and mitigate the threat of the initial actuator saturation, a Robust Linear Quadratic Regulator (RLQR) via sliding mode guidance (SMG) for orbiting a tumbling asteroid is proposed in this paper. The orbital motion of the spacecraft near a tumbling asteroid is modelled in the body-fixed frame considering the sun-relative effects, and the <b>orbiting</b> <b>control</b> problem is formulated as a stabilization of a nonlinear time-varying system. RLQR based on the adaptive feedback linearization is proposed to stabilize the spacecraft orbiting with the uncertainties of the asteroid’s rotation and gravitational field. In order to avoid the initial actuator saturation, SMG is applied to generate the transition process trajectory of the closed-loop system. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified by the simulations of orbiting the asteroid Toutatis 4179...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} equal distribution of satellite constellations on circular target <b>orbits.</b> The <b>control</b> {{goal is to make}} the constellation converge to a circular target orbit, while spatially distributing the satellites at equal inter-satellite distances. The solution is defined in the port-Hamiltonian framework, which gives a clear physical interpretation of the obtained control laws, insight into the energy consumption and complete stability proofs. The controller consists of two parts: the internal control system steers each individual satellite to the target <b>orbit,</b> the external <b>control</b> system equally distributes the satellite constellation. Numerical simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Glish is a {{software}} system for building high-level control applications out of modular, event-oriented programs.

We describe the strengths of the "software bus" approach, how Glish can direct and modify interprocess communication within a distributed application, and how the system is currently used for orbit-correction at the Advanced Light Source at LBL. 1 Introduction We call an accelerator control application "high-level" if it deals with the accelerator in terms of the underlying physics rather than the underlying hardware. One key aspect of such applications is that in general they do not require rapid (1 msec.) real-time response times. Some examples are correcting the <b>orbit,</b> <b>controlling</b> the chromaticity, and changing the tune. These applications have a number of characteristics that can make writing them difficult: 1.
