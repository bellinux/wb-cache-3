5|$|Since 2000, archaeological {{investigations}} have been undertaken to find <b>out</b> <b>more</b> about the vessels and their states of decay. Explanatory labels have been provided.

5|$|A double LP that {{featured}} the album {{on three sides}} of the vinyl at 180-gram quality and an etching on the fourth side. This release also came with a code to allow purchasers to download the entire album in MP3 format. Due to manufacturing delays, this release came <b>out</b> <b>more</b> than {{two months after the}} previous versions, on May 8, 2007.|$|E

5|$|A second act, the Loi sur la réforme postale ("Law on postal reform"), {{was signed}} on 22 April 1849. The second law set <b>out</b> <b>more</b> {{detailed}} terms for {{the launch of}} the postal system and on 17 June 1849, Leopold I officially requested the new Minister of Public Works, Hippolyte Rolin, to act on the new laws.|$|E
5|$|An active art collector, Paul Allen has gifted {{more than}} $100million {{to support the}} arts. On October 15, 2012, the Americans for the Arts awarded Allen with the Eli and Edythe Broad Award for Philanthropy in the Arts. Allen has also loaned <b>out</b> <b>more</b> than 300 pieces from his private art {{collection}} to 47 different venues. In 2013, Allen sold Barnett Newman's Onement VI (1953) at Sotheby's in New York for $43.8million, surpassing its estimate of $30million to $40million.|$|E
5|$|Cimabue {{achieves}} a masterful handling of colour; medieval churches {{tended to be}} extremely colourful, with frescoed walls, painted capitals, and gold leaf paintings. Pale tonalities dominate, with the main contrast found in the dark areas of Christ's hair and beard, which are utilised to make the features of his face stand <b>out</b> <b>more,</b> and position his head as the focal point.|$|E

5|$|Debut {{received}} widespread {{critical acclaim}} from British music critics, though United States reviewers doled <b>out</b> <b>more</b> mixed reviews. Upon its initial release, the album sold {{far greater than}} her label predicted, charting at number three in the United Kingdom and 61 in the United States. It was certified gold in Canada and platinum in the United States, where it remains her best-selling album to date.|$|E
5|$|Having {{learned about}} the block-booking studio system that almost {{guaranteed}} the studios huge profits, Cagney was determined to spread the wealth. He regularly sent money and goods to old friends from his neighborhood, {{though he did not}} generally make this known. His insistence on no more than four films a year was based on his having witnessed actors—even teenagers—regularly being worked 100 hours a week to turn <b>out</b> <b>more</b> films. This experience was an integral reason for his involvement in forming the Screen Actors Guild in 1933.|$|E
5|$|James Hurley (James Marshall) and Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle) {{sneak into}} the office of {{psychiatrist}} Laurence Jacoby (Russ Tamblyn), hoping to find <b>out</b> <b>more</b> about Laura, whom he had been treating. They find a cassette tape she sent him. Meanwhile, Jacoby is distracted by an offer to meet Laura's cousin, Madeline Ferguson (Lee), who has disguised herself as the dead girl; before they can meet, however, he is attacked by a masked man and left unconscious.|$|E

5|$|The Beaufort was {{too fast}} for the torpedoes available, so new tactics had to be {{developed}} and the aircraft was restricted to mine-laying or bombing missions. It was soon grounded for other reasons. After No. 22 Squadron carried <b>out</b> <b>more</b> trials, it began operations on 31 August 1940. On 11 September a torpedo attack succeeded in hitting a 6,000 ton freighter. On 17 September No. 22, 53 and 57 Squadron sank a 1,600 ton freighter in Cherbourg harbour. An E-boat was also destroyed and oil tanks were also set ablaze and burned uncontrollably for several days. The cost was a single Beaufort.|$|E
5|$|The conspirators {{first told}} Justin, Germanus's eldest son, of their intentions. He, in turn, {{informed}} his father, who then held counsel with the comes excubitorum, Marcellus. In {{order to find}} <b>out</b> <b>more</b> of their intentions, Germanus met the conspirators in person, while a trusted aide of Marcellus, named Leontius, was concealed nearby and listened in. Marcellus then informed Emperor Justinian, and the conspirators were arrested, but treated with remarkable leniency. At first, Germanus and his sons too were suspected, until the testimony of Marcellus and the commanders Constantianus and Bouzes cleared them.|$|E
5|$|There was {{a simpler}} {{performance}} on tape {{and a more}} difficult one, with Mariah singing <b>out</b> <b>more,</b> with more licks. But we chose a happy medium. The song really calls for not anything really fancy. But she's always fighting the forces inside of her because she's her own devil's advocate. She {{wants to do something}} that's so over the top and use her talents and the voice she has. But she also knows she has to restrain herself and do what the music really calls for.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the writing}} process, several cast members would give {{suggestion}} notes to the writers {{on how to}} improve some scenes. The writers were frequently annoyed with Armitage, who gave <b>out</b> <b>more</b> notes than any other cast members, however the writers also liked some of his ideas and included them in the scripts. The producers believed that the seventh series was among the more brutal than the others, citing the violent death of Ben.|$|E
5|$|To this end, the 22nd Army Corps issued General Order 89, which stated (in part) {{that the}} guns and {{ammunition}} removed from the dismantled forts {{should be kept in}} storage. Fort Greble was chosen as one of the storage locations. As a second-class fort, Fort Greble continued to receive regular maintenance and upkeep. By the end of August 1865, however, with funds running low, and no further appropriations likely, this work began to slack off. As the money ran <b>out,</b> <b>more</b> and more forts were designated as second- or third-class locations, and were dismantled and the land returned to its original owners.|$|E
5|$|Tom Pryce's helmet design was, in {{comparison}} to later drivers', simple and restrained. His helmet was plain white all over until 1970. At that year's race at Castle Combe, his father asked Pryce to make his helmet stand <b>out</b> <b>more</b> {{so that he could}} easily identify him in a pack of cars. Pryce added five black vertical lines to his helmet, placed just above his visor. From that time the only change to this design was the addition of a Welsh flag to the side of his helmet in 1974.|$|E

5|$|According to the Shenboo Atlas of 1933, in the 1930s {{most people}} lived within the {{perimeter}} of the Xi'an Wall but still {{there were a lot of}} unoccupied open areas. Among the visitors who came to see the Xian Wall were American captain (later general) Stilwell in 1922 and the Czech sinologist Jaroslav Průšek (1906–1980) in 1933. In 1983, the administration of the Xi'an municipality carried <b>out</b> <b>more</b> renovations and additions to the wall. At that time, the Yangmacheng tower, the Zhalou sluice tower, the Kuixinglou dipper tower, the Jiaolou corner tower and the Dilou defense tower were all refurbished; the crumbling parts of the rampart were changed into gates; and the moat was restored. In May 2005, all of Xi'an's ramparts were inter-connected.|$|E
5|$|At the Singapore Airshow in February 2016, Airbus Group {{presented}} Air-Cobot {{and its use}} in {{its vision}} of the hangar of the future. The same month, the Singapore government enlisted Airbus Group to help local maintenance, repair, and operations providers to stay competitive against neighbour countries like Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines which are cheaper. To improve productivity, Airbus Group launches, in October 2016, a testbed hangar where new technologies can be tested. Upon entering the hangar, cameras study the aircraft to detect damages. Mobile robots, {{such as the one}} of the Air-Cobot project, and drones, such as the one of the Aircam project, carry <b>out</b> <b>more</b> detailed inspections.|$|E
5|$|Demand {{for tickets}} by Alabama fans {{was so great}} that the Alabama ticket office accidentally {{oversold}} its allotment of tickets. The office neglected to limit purchases on the forms sent to season-ticket holders, and the office received more than 25,000 orders for its 12,500-ticket allotment. An additional 2,000 tickets were given to Alabama, but the school still had to send <b>out</b> <b>more</b> than 10,000 refunds. Alabama's athletics director was heavily criticized for overselling the ticket allotment and for limiting ticket distribution to fans who had contributed large amounts of money to the athletics department. A group of fans disgruntled at the ticket distribution process eventually levied a class-action lawsuit against the athletic director, claiming contract violations.|$|E
