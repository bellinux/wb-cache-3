25|$|During {{his time}} as an illustrator, looking {{at a picture of}} Stig Blomqvist in his driver's overall and helmet, Bamber began to {{practice}} cartoon drawing of drivers in <b>overalls</b> <b>and</b> a full-face helmet, of whom Blomqvist was the first caricature drawn by Bamber. Rather than drawing faces of drivers, a common feature at the time, he shortcutted it by drawing a ball as a helmet and adding names above their visors to identify drivers. Bamber would continue to practice drawing drivers' caricatures, while working as an illustrator and as an Art Editor for Rallycourse yearbooks.|$|E
25|$|In 1938 the Rosenwald Fund {{provided}} {{money for}} Alston {{to travel to}} the South, which was his first return there since leaving as a child. His travel with Giles Hubert, an inspector for the Farm Security Administration, gave him access to certain situations and he photographed many aspects of rural life. These photographs serves as the basis for a series of genre portraits depicting southern black life. In 1940 he completed Tobacco Farmer, the portrait of a young black farmer in white <b>overalls</b> <b>and</b> a blue shirt with a youthful yet serious look upon his face, {{sitting in front of the}} landscape and buildings he works on and in. That same year he received a second round of funding from the Rosenwald Fund to travel South, and he spent extended time at Atlanta University.|$|E

25|$|Tatlin's tower {{started a}} period of {{exchange}} of ideas between Moscow and Berlin, something reinforced by El Lissitzky and Ilya Ehrenburg's Soviet-German magazine Veshch-Gegenstand-Objet which spread the idea of 'Construction art', as did the Constructivist exhibits at the 1922 Russische Ausstellung in Berlin, organised by Lissitzky. A 'Constructivist international' was formed, which met with Dadaists and De Stijl artists in Germany in 1922. Participants in this short-lived international included Lissitzky, Hans Richter, and László Moholy-Nagy. However the idea of 'art' was becoming anathema to the Russian Constructivists: the INKhUK debates of 1920–22 had culminated {{in the theory of}} Productivism propounded by Osip Brik and others, which demanded direct participation in industry and the end of easel painting. Tatlin {{was one of the first}} to attempt to transfer his talents to industrial production, with his designs for an economical stove, for workers' <b>overalls</b> <b>and</b> for furniture. The Utopian element in Constructivism was maintained by his 'letatlin', a flying machine which he worked on until the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year (in July 1934), they visited Angola once again. This time Lead Belly begged {{them to make}} a recording of a song he had written to take to the Governor requesting parole, which they did. However, unbeknownst to them, Lead Belly was released in August for good time (and because of cost-cutting due to the Depression) and not because of the Lomaxes' recording, which the Governor may not have listened to. In September 1934, Lead Belly wrote to Lomax requesting employment, since he needed to have a job in order not to be sent back to prison. At the urging of John Jr., Lomax engaged Lead Belly as his driver and assistant, and the pair traveled the South together collecting folk songs for the next three months. Then, in December 1934, Lead Belly famously performed illustrating John Lomax's scheduled lecture of folk songs at a smoker and sing-along held at the national MLA meeting in Philadelphia (see Lead Belly). Their association continued for three more months until the following March (1935). In January, Lomax, who knew nothing whatever about the recording business, became Lead Belly's manager and, through a friend, cowboy singer Tex Ritter, got Lead Belly a recording contract with the famous A man Art Satherly of ARC records. Satherly had publicity photos made of the singer wearing <b>overalls</b> <b>and</b> sitting on sacks of grain, garb and setting that were customary in commercial publicity photos of country singers in those days. But Lead Belly's recordings, marketed as race music, failed to sell. A filmed re-enactment in early 1935 for The March of Time newsreel of Lomax's discovery of Lead Belly in prison, led to the myth that John Lomax made Lead Belly perform in prison stripes (which is inaccurate). He did perform in overalls, however. During Lomax's two-week lecture tour with Lead Belly on the eastern college circuit in March 1935 (pre-scheduled by Lomax before teaming up with Lead Belly), the two men quarreled over money and never spoke to one another again.|$|E

500|$|Charlene {{was portrayed}} as a feisty, quick {{tempered}} and outspoken tomboy. She had a difficult relationship {{with her mother and}} did not like being patronised.

Reinforcing her tomboyish image, Charlene trained as a mechanic and she often wore khaki <b>overalls</b> <b>and</b> baggy sweatshirts. Her relationship with Scott Robinson (Jason Donovan) was central to many of her storylines. They became a popular couple with viewers and the relationship helped boost ratings for Neighbours.

500|$|The game uses {{graphics}} and animation as vehicles of characterization. Donkey Kong smirks upon Mario's demise. Pauline has a pink dress and long hair, and a speech balloon crying [...] "HELP!" [...] appears frequently beside her. Mario, depicted in red <b>overalls</b> <b>and</b> a red cap, is an everyman character, a type common in Japan. Graphical limitations {{and the low}} pixel resolution of the small sprites prompted his design: drawing a mouth was infeasible, so the character was given a mustache; the programmers could not animate hair, so he got a cap; and to make his arm movements visible, he needed colored overalls. The artwork used for the cabinets and promotional materials make these cartoon-like character designs even more explicit. Pauline, for example, is depicted to be disheveled (like King Kong Fay Wray) in a torn dress and stiletto heels.|$|E

500|$|In {{his normal}} state, Mario can {{tolerate}} one hit from an enemy and defeat {{most of the}} foes with a stomp. By opening doors the player can find power-ups which grant different abilities.

If the player finds another mushroom while Mario is in the Super Mario form, the item turns into a Fire Flower. When grabbing it, Mario becomes Fire Mario and can throw fireballs to eliminate enemies. A 1-up mushroom known as [...] "Extra Mario Mushroom" [...] or [...] "Toad" [...] can only be found by Fire Mario. Another way to earn an extra life is collecting 30 coins.

500|$|When the {{government}} targeted women {{early in the}} war focussed on extending their existing roles– helping with Belgian refugees, for example—but also on improving recruitment rates amongst men. They did this both through the so-called [...] "Order of the White Feather" [...] and through the promise of home comforts for the men while {{they were at the}} front. In , groups were set up and a campaign started to get women to help in agriculture and in , the Women's Land Army was set up. One goal was to attract middle-class women who would act as models for patriotic engagement in nontraditional duties. However the uniform of the Women's Land Army included male <b>overalls</b> <b>and</b> trousers, which sparked debate on the propriety of such cross-dressing. The government responded with rhetoric that explicitly feminized the new roles.

500|$|The Pike Place Fish Market is {{best known}} for their habit of hurling customers' orders across the {{shopping}} area. A typical routine will involve a customer ordering a fish, with their fishmongers in orange rubber <b>overalls</b> <b>and</b> boots calling out the order, which is loudly shouted back by all the other staff, at which point the original fishmonger will throw the customer's fish behind the counter for wrapping. Initially, the shouted repeating of the ordered fish began as a prank on one employee, but was enjoyed by customers, so it became a tradition. While working, the staff continually yell to each other and chant in unison while they throw ordered fish. At times, the fish market staff will throw a foam fish into the crowd to scare bystanders, or select a customer from the crowds to participate in the fish toss. Above the areas in which they throw fish, the market hangs a sign that reads, [...] "Caution: Low Flying Fish".|$|E

500|$|For Rainbow, Carey {{embarked}} on her fourth and third worldwide tour, titled the Rainbow World Tour (2000). Throughout it, Carey performed the song live during every show. The synopsis behind each performance was a wrestling match in between Carey and Bianca, where Carey would sing the remix and original {{versions of the}} song throughout each small interlude of the fight. Carey was brought out with boxing gloves to the stage, performing the remix version of the song. After she began wrestling and boxing with Bianca, she defeated her, prompting her to begin the original version of the song. [...] "Heartbreaker" [...] featured a very different set up for Carey's [...] (2002–03).
