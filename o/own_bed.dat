She kept a satin-lined coffin in her bedroom, and occasionally slept in it or lay in it to study her roles, though, contrary to the popular stories, she never took it with her on her travels.

He was succeeded by his son Peter II of Cyprus. However Hugh saw another {{opportunity}} to claim the throne of Cyprus and left the Peloponnese to travel to Nicosia, effectively abandoning his campaign. Marie continued the civil war until 1370. Unable to secure victory, Marie sold her rights to Philip II for 6,000 gold pieces. Her fiefdoms of Vostitsa and Nivelets were sold to Nerio I Acciaioli, later Duke of Athens. She only retained her fiefdom of Kalamata.|$|E

25|$|Many Belgian convents and monasteries {{sheltered}} Jewish children, {{pretending that}} they were Christian - among them the Franciscan Sisters in Bruges, the Sisters of Don Bosco in Courtrai, the Sisters of St Mary near Brussels, the Dominican Sisters at Lubbeek and others. Fr Joseph Andre of Namur found shelter for around 100 children in convents, returning them to Jewish community leaders after the war. Andre was very active in the rescue of Jews, handing over his <b>own</b> <b>bed</b> to Jewish refugees, and finding families to hide them, and distributing food as well as communications between families. He is credit with saving some 200 lives, and was forced into hiding {{in the final stages}} of the war.|$|E
25|$|Circumcision is an {{important}} ritual among the Tanala, {{as in many other}} Malagasy ethnic groups. A range of fady are associated with the practice, particularly for nobles. A noble Tanala mother became subject to a new range of fady after the circumcision of her son. She was thereafter forbidden to take her son for a walk, eat on her <b>own</b> <b>bed</b> or in secret, or consume dried meat of any kind or the meat of a zebu that had been slaughtered (as opposed to having died of natural causes). If she broke any of these taboos, or if the child urinated or defecated during the circumcision ceremony, the child would lose his noble status (an older fady previously required that the child be put to death in such cases).|$|E

25|$|Caesar {{felt that}} it would be much safer far away from Sulla should the Dictator change his mind, so he left Rome and joined the army, serving under Marcus Minucius Thermus in Asia and Servilius Isauricus in Cilicia. He served with distinction, winning the Civic Crown for his part in the Siege of Mytilene. He went on a mission to Bithynia to secure the {{assistance}} of King Nicomedes's fleet, but he spent so long at Nicomedes' court that rumours arose of an affair with the king, which Caesar vehemently denied {{for the rest of his}} life. Ironically, the loss of his priesthood had allowed him to pursue a military career, as the high priest of Jupiter was not permitted to touch a horse, sleep three nights outside his <b>own</b> <b>bed</b> or one night outside Rome, or look upon an army.|$|E
25|$|The two men {{returned}} to Bradley's flat, where Ireland {{suggested that he}} tie Bradley up; Bradley expressed his displeasure at the idea. In order to get Bradley to comply, Ireland {{told him that he}} was unable to perform sexually without elements of bondage. Bradley hesitantly cooperated and was soon trussed up on his <b>own</b> <b>bed,</b> face down, with a noose around his neck. After Ireland had secured Bradley, he demanded money and a PIN number under the threat of torture. Ireland assured Bradley that he was merely a thief and would leave after stealing Bradley's money. After Bradley gave Ireland his PIN, which Ireland later used to steal £200, along with £100 in cash stolen from Bradley's flat, Ireland told him that he should go to sleep, as he wouldn't be leaving his flat for hours. Bradley eventually did fall asleep and Ireland momentarily thought of leaving Bradley unharmed. Ireland then realised that Bradley could identify him and used the noose, which he had earlier attached around Bradley's neck, to strangle him. Before leaving Bradley's flat, he placed a doll on top of the dead man's body.|$|E
25|$|Simon Bodger (Andy Cunningham) - Simon Bodger is a {{handyman}} {{who has had}} various jobs {{throughout the}} series, probably because when he is nervous he makes silly mistakes and Badger's antics repeatedly get him sacked. In the first series he {{was working as a}} cook for Troff's Nosherama. He got sacked after Badger accidentally revealed himself to praise Mr Troff for giving Simon the job of chef. In the second and third series he was a caretaker at the (fictional) Letsby Avenue Junior School. This is not far from Troffs' Nosherama, as the Letsby Avenue football team are referenced in the first episode of series one. In the fourth series he was a handyman and zookeeper at Chessington World of Adventures. In the fifth, sixth and seventh series he was seemingly unemployed and renting a flat, occasionally working as a casual handyman to his landlady, Mrs Dribelle. In the eighth and ninth series he was manager of his <b>own</b> <b>Bed</b> and Breakfast while a relative who owned it went on a round-the-world trip. Badger is his anthropomorphic talking pet and best friend, although all the trouble that Bodger ends up in is usually down to Badger. Regular gags usually involve Badger covering Bodger in mashed potato or some other messy substance, either intentionally or accidentally.|$|E

At a Banking Committee hearing in March, Warren asked Treasury Department officials why criminal charges were not brought against HSBC for its money laundering practices. With her questions being continually dodged, Warren compared money laundering to drug possession, saying: [...] "If you're caught with an ounce of cocaine, the chances are good you're going to go to jail...

500|$|Mandela was {{a private}} person who often {{concealed}} his emotions and confided in very few people. Privately, he lived an austere life, refusing to drink alcohol or smoke, and even as President made his <b>own</b> <b>bed.</b> Renowned for his mischievous sense of humour, he was known for being both stubborn and loyal, and at times exhibited a quick temper. He was typically friendly and welcoming, and appeared relaxed in conversation with everyone, including his opponents. A self-described Anglophile, {{he claimed to have}} lived by the [...] "trappings of British style and manners". Constantly polite and courteous, he was attentive to all, irrespective of their age or status, and often talked to children or servants. He was known for his ability to find common ground with very different communities. In later life, he always looked for the best in people, even defending political opponents to his allies, who sometimes thought him too trusting of others. He was fond of Indian cuisine, and had a lifelong interest in archaeology and boxing.|$|E
500|$|... {{the latest}} update was version 0.43.05, with it {{completing}} 14 years in development despite being an alpha version. Adams {{and his brother}} have a to-do list of features the game should have before version 1.0 and the version number is the percentage progress of its completion. He {{says he has been}} able to maintain focus by shifting his attention to different aspects of the game, given its large coverage. While regular game development aim to perfect their work for release, he considers that a drawback since he continues exploring and learning while adding new features. Wired and Rock, Paper, Shotgun called some of its bug fixes unintentional and funny, with PC Gamer saying it makes an entertaining RSS feed to subscribe to. Adams has two favorite bugs.

In an article in The Spectator in 2003, Stacey's great-great-nephew, the writer and journalist Tom Stacey, wrote that the donation of the window, which depicts Doom, was considered within the family to have been a penance for Francis Stacey's dissolute lifestyle while at Cambridge. The article states that Stacey felt especial remorse over an incident in which, in advance of his own marriage, he bequeathed his town [...] "girl-friend" [...] to another King's Fellow, named Ridler – Fellows of King's College were expected to be celibate – but that Ridler had subsequently died in the girl-friend's bed; Stacey had been involved in a subterfuge which saw the dead Ridler returned to King's, where the body was [...] "discovered" [...] the following morning dead in his <b>own</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E

2500|$|By 1892, Polignac, aged 57, inept {{with money}} and impoverished through {{investments}} {{in a series of}} get-rich-quick schemes, was destitute; his nephews helped him with loans but noted that desperate action was needed. The solution that they suggested was marriage to a woman of appropriate means. Polignac discussed the matter with Montesquiou, who in turn discussed it with his cousin Élisabeth Greffulhe, and out of these conversations the name of Winnaretta Singer, daughter of Isaac Singer, the sewing machine tycoon, arose. Her marriage to Prince Louis de Scey-Montbéliard had lately been annulled. [...] Her social status could be improved by marrying a prince, even a poor one. And the arrangement would have other benefits: Polignac's homosexuality would not be an issue as Winnaretta was a lesbian She was intimately interested in music, however, something the two did have in common. Polignac asked the comtesse Greffulhe to sound out Madame Singer on the subject of a mariage blanc (unconsummated marriage) in which each partner would have their <b>own</b> <b>bed</b> but would share artistic interests. [...] Montesquiou, who collaborated with Winnaretta on some artistic projects, asked her to speak with Madame Greffulhe, and there the arguments were reviewed; her social position, compromised by divorce, would be improved by an alliance with {{one of the oldest and}} most distinguished aristocratic families in France; with the thirty-one year age difference, and the predilections of the bride and groom, Winnaretta would be free to lead her personal life as she wished, with no sexual demands from Edmond.|$|E
