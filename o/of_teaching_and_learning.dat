ASU Knowledge Enterprise Development (KED) advances research, innovation, strategic partnerships, entrepreneurship, economic development and international development. KED is led by Sethuraman Panchanathan. KED supports several interdisciplinary research institutes and initiatives: Institute for Humanities Research, NewSpace Initiative, Biodesign Institute, Institute for the Science <b>of</b> <b>Teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>Learning,</b> Julie Ann Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability, Institute for Social Science Research, LightWorks, McCain Institute for International Leadership, Decision Theater Network, Flexible Electronics and Display Center, Complex Adaptive Systems @ ASU, Global Security Initiative. Other notable and famed institutes at ASU are: The Institute of Human Origins, L. William Seidman Research Institute (W. P. Carey School of Business), Learning Sciences Institute, Herberger Research Institute, and the Hispanic Research Center. Much of the research conducted at ASU is considered cutting edge with its focus on interdisciplinarity. The Biodesign Institute for instance, conducts research on issues such as biomedical and healthcare outcomes as part of a collaboration with Mayo Clinic to diagnose and treat rare diseases, including cancer. Biodesign Institute researchers have also developed various techniques for reading and detecting biosignatures which expanded in 2006 with an $18million grant from the National Human Genome Research Institute of the National Institutes of Health. The institute also is heavily involved in sustainability research, primarily through reuse of CO2 via biological feedback and various biomasses (e.g. algae) to synthesize clean biofuels. Heliae is a Biodesign Institute spin-off and much of its business centers on algal-derived, high value products. Furthermore, the institute is heavily involved in security research including technology that can detect biological and chemical changes in the air and water. The university has received more than $30million in funding from the Department of Defense for adapting this technology for use in detecting the presence of biological and chemical weapons. Research conducted at the Biodesign Institute by ASU professor Charles Arntzen made possible the production of Ebola antibodies in specially modified tobacco plants that researchers at Mapp Biopharmaceutical used to create the Ebola therapeutic ZMapp. The treatment is credited with saving the lives of two aid workers. For his work, Arntzen was named the No. 1 honoree among Fast Company's annual [...] "100 Most Creative People in Business" [...] 2015 awards.|$|E

[...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2011 The {{provision}} <b>of</b> authentic <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> in the Mathematics {{classroom is}} one of the corner stones of the National Curriculum Statement (NCS). This study investigated to what extent teachers provide authentic <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> in their Mathematics classrooms. A literature study was undertaken to explain authentic <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning.</b> The use <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> methods <b>and</b> strategies, <b>learning</b> activities, assessment methods and strategies, {{and the role of the}} teacher and learner in the context <b>of</b> authentic <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> in the classroom were explored. The literature review provided the conceptual framework for the study; as well as the framework for designing questionnaires and an observation schedule. The questionnaires were utilized to obtain the perceptions of teachers and learners regarding opportunities provided by teachers for the provision <b>of</b> authentic <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> experiences in the Mathematics classroom, and the observation schedule determined how and to what extent the principles <b>of</b> authentic <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> were translated into practice. Data was collected by means of quantitative, non-experimental descriptive survey research. The self-constructed questionnaires were administered to a convenient sample of a purposively selected group of Grade 4, Grade 5 and Grade 6 Intermediate Phase Mathematics teachers (n = 24) and learners (n = 440) in the Johannesburg South District of the Gauteng Department of Education. In addition to this, the classroom practices of six of the teachers who completed the questionnaire were observed over a period of six months. The triangulation of teacher and learner data revealed similarities and differences in opinion related to the opportunities that teachers create for authentic <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> in the Mathematics classroom. In essence, the data revealed that teachers who took part in the study apparently understand the principles that underpin authentic <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning,</b> <b>and</b> to some extent comply with the principles <b>of</b> authentic <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> in their classrooms. In addition to this, the triangulation of the teacher responses to the questionnaire and the observations of the classroom practices of the teachers indicated that in practice all the application of the principles <b>of</b> authentic <b>teaching,</b> <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> assessment have not yet fully become a reality in the Mathematics classroom. According to the learner responses, to the questionnaire, as well as the observations, it appeared that the application <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> assessment strategies that promote authentic <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> are under-utilized by the teachers.
