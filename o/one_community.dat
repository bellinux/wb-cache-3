It began at an intersection with U.S. Route4 (US4) east of the village of Whitehall and ended at the Vermont state line {{in the town of}} Hampton, just east of a junction with NY22A. The route passed through largely rural areas and entered only <b>one</b> <b>community,</b> the small hamlet of East Whitehall.|$|E

The Ferrari driver also received predominant congratulations from the European press. Häkkinen's second-place finish secured him second position in the Drivers' Championship, while Ferrari extended the gap to McLaren in the Constructors' Championship to thirteen points, with one race remaining in the season.|$|E
5|$|Since 1882, 45 {{players have}} held the {{position}} of club captain for Newton Heath LYR F.C., Newton Heath F.C. or Manchester United F.C. The first club captain was E.

If, as we hope, provincial autonomy is given to the provinces {{as a result of the}} reforms that may be granted, it should be essential that our Federation should be in a position to claim to be a truly representative body of all communities. What objection can there be to admit such Brahmins as are willing to subscribe to the aims and objects of our Federation? It may be that the Brahmins may not join even if the ban is removed. But surely our Federation will not thereafter be open to objection on the ground that it is an exclusive organisation.|$|E
5|$|Tod favoured the then-fashionable {{concept of}} Romantic nationalism. Influenced by this, {{he thought that}} each princely state should be {{inhabited}} by only <b>one</b> <b>community</b> and his policies were designed to expel Marathas, Pindaris and other groups from Rajput territories. It also influenced his instigation of treaties that were intended to redraw the territorial boundaries of the various states. The geographical and political boundaries before his time had in some cases been blurred, primarily due to local arrangements based on common kinship, and he wanted a more evident delineation of the entities, He was successful {{in both of these}} endeavours.|$|E

25|$|In Egypt, {{the first}} home of monasticism, the {{jurisdiction}} of the abbot, or archimandrite, was but loosely defined. Sometimes he ruled over only <b>one</b> <b>community,</b> sometimes over several, each of which had its own abbot as well. Saint John Cassian speaks of an abbot of the Thebaid who had 500 monks under him. By the Rule of St Benedict, which, until the Cluniac reforms, was the norm in the West, the abbot has jurisdiction over only <b>one</b> <b>community.</b> The rule, as was inevitable, was subject to frequent violations; {{but it was not until}} the foundation of the Cluniac Order that the idea of a supreme abbot, exercising jurisdiction over all the houses of an order, was definitely recognized.|$|E
