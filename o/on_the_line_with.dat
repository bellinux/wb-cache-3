5|$|After {{the first}} month, {{the actual number}} of {{passengers}} was 125,971, compared to the predicted annual total of around 650,000 return journeys, i.e. 1.3m single journeys. By 23 January 2016, 537,327 passengers had been carried <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>with</b> weekly figures consistently showing over 20,000 journeys made. Figures released on 31 May 2016 showed that 694,373 persons had been carried since 6 September 2015, an increase of 22% by reference to the predicted patronage. Tweedbank station saw 183,918 journeys compared to a predicted 18,978, while Galashiels had 104,593 trips against a predicted 20,567. However, Eskbank, Gorebridge and Shawfair recorded less than their predicted usage. In September 2016, it was announced that one million passengers had been carried on the reopened line.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, SIRT {{purchased}} {{the property of}} the B and merged it with the Staten Island Railway. The line had been worked with B and SIRT equipment since it opened in 1890. By 1949, there were no longer any staffed offices along the line except at Arlington. All of the stations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> <b>with</b> the exception of Harbor Road, Lake Avenue, Livingston and Snug Harbor, had waiting rooms and agents. The stations without waiting rooms were flag stops; the train would only stop if there was someone waiting at the station. The station at Port Ivory, which was used for workers of the Procter & Gamble Plant and was only open for the morning and evening rush hour, closed around the year 1950.|$|E
5|$|In June 1968, an {{agreement}} was reached where the state Transportation Assistance Authority would pay $2 million and Penn Central would pay $2.5 million for the 11 Metroliners for Harrisburg service. On July 14, a 4-car train was tested <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> <b>with</b> several demonstration runs for officials on August 21. In early October, several test trains proved {{the viability of the}} planned sub-3-hour schedules. Substation modifications later that month and a legal settlement between Budd and Penn Central in November paved the way for service to begin. On December 20, Penn Central announced that Metroliner service would begin on January 16, 1969.|$|E

5|$|It {{had been}} {{decided that the}} Bergen Line, unlike the Voss Line, was to be built with {{standard}} gauge. So the newly laid line from Bergen to Voss had to be converted {{in time for the}} opening of the Bergen Line. This was especially challenging because of the continuous traffic <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> <b>with</b> 36 departures per day to Nesttun, six to Garnes and four to Voss. In preparation a few curves had to be straightened, the tunnels widened and the bridges strengthened. On the night of 10/11 August 1904 all the track was changed and in the morning the trains could operate on standard gauge to Voss.|$|E
5|$|The 45th Infantry Division {{participated in}} its fourth amphibious assault landing during Operation Dragoon on 15 August 1944, at St. Maxime, in Southern France. The 45th Infantry Division landed its 157th and 180th regimental combat teams and {{captured}} {{the heights of}} the Chaines de Mar before meeting with the 1st Special Service Force. The German Army, reeling from the Battle of Normandy, in which it had suffered a major defeat, pulled back after a short fight, {{part of an overall}} German withdrawal to the east following the landings. Soldiers of the 45th Infantry Division engaged the dispersed forces of German Army Group G, suffering very few casualties. The U.S. Seventh Army, along with Free French forces, were able to advance north quickly. By 12 September, the Seventh Army linked up with Lieutenant General George S. Patton's U.S. Third Army, advancing from Normandy, joining the two forces at Dijon. Against slight opposition, it spearheaded the drive for the Belfort Gap. The 45th Infantry Division took the strongly defended city of Epinal on 24 September. The division was then reassigned to V Corps, under the command of Major General Leonard T. Gerow, for its next advance. On 30 September the division crossed the Moselle River and entered the western foothills of the Vosges, taking Rambervillers. It would remain in the area for a month waiting for other units to catch up before crossing the Mortagne River on 23 October. The division remained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>with</b> the U.S. 6th Army Group the southernmost of three army groups advancing through France.|$|E
5|$|Vettel drew {{to within}} two-tenths {{of a second}} behind Alonso as the final lap started, and came across Sutil, Hülkenberg, Petrov and Massa; both drivers managed to get past Petrov, and Alonso {{maintained}} the first position heading into the final sector of the track. The yellow flag for Kovalainen's car meant that Vettel's final chance of an overtake, into the final corner, was denied, and Alonso took the checkered flag on lap61 to win the race, 0.293 seconds ahead of Vettel. Alonso secured the first, and, as of 2015, the only Grand Chelem (leading the entire race from pole position with fastest lap) of his career {{as well as the}} first since Schumacher achieved the feat at the 2004 Hungarian Grand Prix. Webber was third, 1.2 seconds ahead of Button in fourth. Rosberg, Barrichello and Kubica took the next three positions. Sutil held off Hülkenberg in the final sector of the track for eighth and ninth <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>with</b> Massa in tenth. Petrov, Alguersuari, Schumacher and Buemi finished one lap behind Alonso, with di Grassi and Kovalainen (despite his retirement) the last of the classified finishers.|$|E

25|$|In December 1845, the Sheffield, Ashton-Under-Lyne and Manchester Railway opened, and Neepsend was a {{key point}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>with</b> Neepsend engine shed being built to supply and {{overhaul}} locomotives for the nearby Sheffield Victoria railway station. The Neepsend shed even built a number of locomotives for the line.

25|$|Carrier Air Wing Seventeen (CVW-17) was {{established}} on 1 November 1966 and {{assigned to the}} USS Forrestal. Although an Atlantic Fleet carrier, Forrestal´s first deployment with CVW-17 was to Vietnam, from June to September 1967. After only four days <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>with</b> 150 sorties flown, a Zuni rocket was accidentally fired on the flight deck {{on the morning of}} 29 July 1967.

He led Michigan to an overtime win in the Orange Bowl over Alabama, throwing for 369 yards, four touchdowns, leading the team back from a pair of 14-point deficits in regulation (14–0 in the first half, and 28–14 in the second). He threw the game-winning score on a bootleg to tight end Shawn Thompson. Michigan won the game when Alabama missed an extra point following its own touchdown.|$|E
25|$|On 27 November 1909 the Bergen Line opened from Voss to Hønefoss, and the Voss Line {{lost its}} {{independent}} status.

25|$|The Norwegian State Railways {{operates}} {{passenger train}} services on the line. Using Class 93 trains, they operate four services {{in each direction}} per day. Travel time is 1 hour and 17 minutes, and serves mostly as a feeding service to express trains on the Dovre Line. At Åndalsnes there are coordinating buses to the populated areas on the coast, such as Ålesund and Molde. During the summer, from June through August, NSB operates the trains as tourists trains, involving an audio guide over the speakers, the train driving extra slow past landmarks, and the train stopping altogether at Kylling Bridge and at Trollveggen. The travel time increases to 1 hour and 35 minutes,. CargoLink operates freight trains <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> <b>with</b> one service per day per direction during the night.|$|E

25|$|A {{spur line}} to Isola Fabrikker opened on 1966 {{and a new}} spur line to the cement factory opened on 30 September 1974, {{replacing}} an aerial tramway. Norcem has since been the main customer for freight trains <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> <b>with</b> 900,000 tonnes of limestone hauled in 1998. Proposals for reopening the line were launched in 1989, but never materialized. Grenland Harbour upgraded the port terminal at Tangen during the late 1980s and a branch to the Grenland Terminal was opened in 1993, with the port authority hoping that an international ferry service would be started. However, the plans never materialized. Two El 13 locomotives collided at Norcem on 18 September 1998, although neither motorman was seriously injured. CargoNet started a weekly container train service each from Brevik to Oslo and Bergen in 2014, allowing for transit from ship traffic.|$|E
25|$|Booth {{followed}} up his first career defeat with victory {{back at home}} beating Mark Reynolds in Coventry before getting a fight with the current holder of the British and Commonwealth flyweight titles Keith Knox. The fight due {{to take place in}} Belfast on 16 October 1999 would have both titles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>with</b> Booth eventually winning in the 10th round. The new champion defended his Commonwealth title first when in January 2000 he beat South African Abbey Mnisi. In November 2000 he put both titles on the line when defending against 8-0 prospect Ian Napa eventually winning a 12-round unanimous decision. In February 2001, he made the second defence of his Commonwealth belt knocking out Zimbabwean, Nogthula Tshabangu at the Harvey Hadden Leisure Centre in Nottingham. Booth's brother, Nicky, was also on the bill and defeated Adey Lewis with a seventh round stoppage to crown a good night for the brothers and a unique one in British boxing history in that {{it was the first time}} that two siblings had defended titles on the same night.|$|E
25|$|On April 14, Steiner faced {{off against}} Nowinski {{in a debate}} over the Iraq War. Later that year, Steiner formed a tag team with Test, with Stacy Keibler as their manager. The team lasted several months, and feuded with La Résistance. They broke up after Test turned heel and began misogynistically {{treating}} Keibler. On June 15, Steiner defeated Test in a grudge match to win the managerial services of Keibler at Bad Blood, but lost her back to Test in a rematch on the August 18 episode of Raw. At Unforgiven on September 21, Steiner faced Test with Keibler's managerial services again <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>with</b> the extra stipulation that, if Steiner lost, he would become Test's manservant. Steiner lost after Keibler's interference backfired, and the tag team was reunited at Test's behest. After another mistake by Keibler cost the team a match on the September 29 episode of Raw, a frustrated Steiner belly to belly suplexed her, resulting in Steiner turning heel and teaming on better terms with Test as Keibler was forced to remain their reluctant manager. On December 1, Mick Foley fired in storyline Steiner and Test freeing Stacy as their manager. His last WWE match was {{as a part of}} the 2004 Royal Rumble, lasting over 6 minutes before being eliminated by Booker T. Steiner suffered an injury in 2004, sidelining him for two months.
