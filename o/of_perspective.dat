5|$|Art has {{sometimes}} stimulated {{the development of}} mathematics, as when Brunelleschi's theory <b>of</b> <b>perspective</b> in architecture and painting started a cycle of research {{that led to the}} work of Brook Taylor and Johann Heinrich Lambert on the mathematical foundations <b>of</b> <b>perspective</b> drawing, and ultimately to the mathematics of projective geometry of Girard Desargues and Jean-Victor Poncelet.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's {{youth was}} spent in a Florence that was ornamented by the works of these artists and by Donatello's contemporaries, Masaccio, whose figurative frescoes were imbued with realism and emotion, and Ghiberti, whose Gates of Paradise, gleaming with gold leaf, {{displayed}} the art of combining complex figure compositions with detailed architectural backgrounds. Piero della Francesca had made a detailed study <b>of</b> <b>perspective,</b> {{and was the first}} painter to make a scientific study of light. These studies and Alberti's treatise De Pictura were to {{have a profound effect on}} younger artists and in particular on Leonardo's own observations and artworks.|$|E
5|$|Other {{relationships}} {{include the}} algorithmic analysis of artworks by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, {{the finding that}} traditional batiks from different regions of Java have distinct fractal dimensions, and stimuli to mathematics research, especially Filippo Brunelleschi's theory <b>of</b> <b>perspective,</b> which eventually led to Girard Desargues's projective geometry. A persistent view, based ultimately on the Pythagorean notion of harmony in music, holds that everything was arranged by Number, that God is the geometer of the world, and that therefore the world's geometry is sacred, as seen in artworks such as William Blake's The Ancient of Days.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>perspective</b> {{was part}} of a wider trend towards realism in the arts. Painters developed other techniques, studying light, shadow, and, famously in the case of Leonardo da Vinci, human anatomy. Underlying these changes in artistic method was a renewed desire to depict the beauty of nature and to unravel the axioms of aesthetics, with the works of Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael representing artistic pinnacles that were much imitated by other artists. Other notable artists include Sandro Botticelli, working for the Medici in Florence, Donatello, another Florentine, and Titian in Venice, among others.|$|E
5|$|The jealous {{attention}} {{which has}} been paid to the unities both of time and place has taken away the principle <b>of</b> <b>perspective</b> in the drama, and all the interest which objects derive from distance, from contrast, from privation, from change of fortune, from long-cherished passion; and contrasts our view of life from a strange and romantic dream, long, obscure, and infinite, into a smartly contested, three hours' inaugural disputation on its merits by the different candidates for theatrical applause.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{is part of}} a cycle on the life of Saint Peter, and describes a scene from the Gospel of Matthew, in which Jesus directs Peter to find a coin in the mouth of a fish in order to pay the temple tax.

The Tribute Money suffered great damage in the centuries after its creation, until the chapel went through a thorough restoration in the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|The rudiments <b>of</b> <b>perspective</b> {{arrived with}} Giotto (1266/7 – 1337), who {{attempted}} to draw in perspective using an algebraic method to determine the placement of distant lines. In 1415, the Italian architect Filippo Brunelleschi and his friend Leon Battista Alberti demonstrated the geometrical method of applying perspective in Florence, using similar triangles as formulated by Euclid, to find the apparent height of distant objects. Brunelleschi's own perspective paintings are lost, but Masaccio's painting of the Holy Trinity shows his principles at work.|$|E
5|$|Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528) was a German Renaissance {{printmaker}} {{who made}} important contributions to polyhedral literature in his 1525 book, Underweysung der Messung (Education on Measurement), meant {{to teach the}} subjects of linear perspective, geometry in architecture, Platonic solids, and regular polygons. Dürer was likely influenced by the works of Luca Pacioli and Piero della Francesca during his trips to Italy. While the examples <b>of</b> <b>perspective</b> in Underweysung der Messung are underdeveloped and contain inaccuracies, there is a detailed discussion of polyhedra. Dürer is also the first to introduce in text the idea of polyhedral nets, polyhedra unfolded to lie flat for printing. Dürer published another influential book on human proportions called Vier Bücher von Menschlicher Proportion (Four Books on Human Proportion) in 1528.|$|E
5|$|In the Grolier Codex captives {{are shown}} bound with cords leading to their necks, however {{the most common}} {{convention}} in Mesoamerican art is the depiction of captives bound by the arms or wrists. Some of the figures in the codex represent deities (on pages 1–2, 4–6 and 9) and some represent mortal warriors without supernatural attributes (on pages 3, 7 and 8). Both the deities and the mortals are performing the same actions such as the capture of a prisoner, or conquest symbolised by a spear passing through a temple. Although the codex depicts the stations of Venus, none of the warlike figures is identified with attributes normally associated with the planet in Maya or central Mexican art. On page 9, a bound captive is depicted from a high point of view with a sense <b>of</b> <b>perspective</b> that French Mesoamericanist and iconographer Claude-François Baudez considers alien to Mesoamerican art. God K (K'awiil) is depicted twice in the codex. However, his attributes are inconsistent with other pre-Columbian depictions, as he is shown with human incisors instead of snake fangs.|$|E

5|$|The Kingdom of This World is {{considered}} to be Alejo Carpentier's first great novel. He is praised for his skillful inclusion of Haitian voodoo, myth, and history in the work, as well as for contributing to the definition of Latin American identity. Although the presence of magic realism in The Kingdom of This World has been acclaimed by critics and discussed at length within the academic community, this concern is paralleled by a lack of interest in Carpentier's technical work in the novel. In particular, his vision of time has been widely ignored. The Kingdom of This World has also been criticized for its narrative organization, which predominantly relies on opposition rather than on succession: the novel does not present history in terms of a sequence of events and their consequences. The gaps within chronological time that occur throughout this novel as well as the sudden changes <b>of</b> <b>perspective</b> and minimal transitional narrative have led some to criticize the book for the chaotic first impression it gives the reader.|$|E
5|$|Turkish {{miniature}} {{is an art}} form, {{which can}} be linked to the Persian miniature tradition, as well as strong Chinese artistic influences. The words taswir or nakish were used to define the art of miniature painting in Ottoman Turkish. The studios the artists worked in were called Nakkashanes. The miniatures were usually not signed, perhaps because of the rejection of individualism, but also because the works were not created entirely by one person; the head painter designed the composition of the scene, and his apprentices drew the contours (which were called tahrir) with black or colored ink and then painted the miniature without creating an illusion of third dimension. The head painter, and much more often the scribe of the text, were indeed named and depicted in some of the manuscripts. The understanding <b>of</b> <b>perspective</b> was {{different from that of the}} nearby European Renaissance painting tradition, and the scene depicted often included different time periods and spaces in one picture. They followed closely the context of the book they were included in, resembling more illustrations rather than standalone works of art.|$|E
5|$|Mathematics can {{be discerned}} {{in many of}} the arts, such as music, dance, painting, architecture, and sculpture. Each of these is richly {{associated}} with mathematics. Among the connections to the visual arts, mathematics can provide tools for artists, such as the rules of linear perspective as described by Brook Taylor and Johann Lambert, or the methods of descriptive geometry, now applied in software modelling of solids, dating back to Albrecht Dürer and Gaspard Monge. Artists from Luca Pacioli in the Middle Ages and Leonardo da Vinci and Albrecht Dürer in the Renaissance have made use of and developed mathematical ideas in the pursuit of their artistic work. The use <b>of</b> <b>perspective</b> began, despite some embryonic usages in the architecture of Ancient Greece, with Italian painters such as Giotto in the 13th century; rules such as the vanishing point were first formulated by Brunelleschi in about 1413, his theory influencing Leonardo and Dürer. Isaac Newton's work on the optical spectrum influenced Goethe's Theory of Colours and in turn artists such as Philipp Otto Runge, J. M. W. Turner, the Pre-Raphaelites and Wassily Kandinsky. Artists may also choose to analyse the symmetry of a scene. Tools may be applied by mathematicians who are exploring art, or artists inspired by mathematics, such as M. C. Escher (inspired by H. S. M. Coxeter) and the architect Frank Gehry, who more tenuously argued that computer aided design enabled him to express himself in a wholly new way.|$|E
