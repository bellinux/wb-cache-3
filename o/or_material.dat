5|$|Other kings had {{inspired}} more respect, {{but perhaps}} only Henry VIII had endeared {{himself to the}} popular imagination as much as this one. He was the playboy monarch, naughty but nice, the hero of all who prized urbanity, tolerance, good humour, {{and the pursuit of}} pleasure above the more earnest, sober, <b>or</b> <b>material</b> virtues.|$|E
5|$|Tales {{distinguish}} kitsune {{gifts from}} kitsune payments. If a kitsune offers a payment or reward that includes money <b>or</b> <b>material</b> wealth, part {{or all of}} the sum will consist of old paper, leaves, twigs, stones, or similar valueless items under a magical illusion. True kitsune gifts are usually intangibles, such as protection, knowledge, or long life.|$|E
5|$|During an {{encounter}} with Jupiter in 1992, the Ulysses spacecraft detected a stream of dust-sized particles being ejected from the Jovian system. The dust in these discrete streams travels away from Jupiter at speeds upwards of several hundred kilometres per second, has an average particle size of 10μm, and consists primarily of sodium chloride. Dust measurements by Galileo showed that these dust streams originate from Io, but exactly how these form, whether from Io's volcanic activity <b>or</b> <b>material</b> removed from the surface, is unknown.|$|E

40|$|This {{invention}} {{is generally}} {{in the field}} of improved methods for the localized delivery of heat and the use thereof for the repair of tissue. The method involves localized induction of hyperthermia in tissue <b>or</b> <b>materials</b> by delivering nanoparticles to the tissue <b>or</b> <b>materials</b> and exposing the nanoparticles to an excitation source under conditions wherein they emit heat. The generation of heat effects the joining of the tissue <b>or</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{engagement}} {{had lasted}} just ten minutes according to Shannons log, or eleven minutes by Lieutenant Wallis' watch. Broke more modestly claimed fifteen minutes in his official despatch. Shannon had lost 23 men killed, and had 56 wounded. Chesapeake had about 48 killed, including four lieutenants, the master {{and many other}} of her officers, and 99 wounded. Shannon {{had been hit by}} a total of 158 projectiles, Chesapeake by 362 (these figures include grapeshot). In the time the batteries of both ships were firing, the Americans had been exposed to 44 roundshot, whilst the British had received 10 or 11 in reply (these are figures for shot which would have produced casualties <b>or</b> <b>material</b> damage; some of Chesapeakes shot was fired low, bouncing off Shannons side at waterline level). Even before being boarded, Chesapeake had lost the gunnery duel by a considerable margin.|$|E
5|$|Castro co-founded a legal {{partnership}} that primarily catered for poor Cubans, although it proved a financial failure. Caring little for money <b>or</b> <b>material</b> goods, Castro {{failed to pay}} his bills; his furniture was repossessed and electricity cut off, distressing his wife. He {{took part in a}} high-school protest in Cienfuegos in November 1950, fighting with police in protest at the Education Ministry's ban on student associations; arrested and charged for violent conduct, the magistrate dismissed the charges. His hopes for Cuba still centered on Chibás and the Partido Ortodoxo, and he was present at Chibás' politically motivated suicide in 1951. Seeing himself as Chibás' heir, Castro wanted to run for Congress in the June 1952 elections, though senior Ortodoxo members feared his radical reputation and refused to nominate him. Instead he was nominated as a candidate for the House of Representatives by party members in Havana's poorest districts, and began campaigning. The Ortodoxo had considerable support and was predicted to do well in the election.|$|E
5|$|This New Life is endless, {{and even}} after my {{physical}} death it will be kept alive by those who live the life of complete renunciation of falsehood, lies, hatred, anger, greed and lust; and who, to accomplish all this, do no lustful actions, do no harm to anyone, do no backbiting, do not seek material possessions or power, who accept no homage, neither covet honor nor shun disgrace, and fear no one and nothing; by those who rely wholly and solely on God, and who love God purely {{for the sake of}} loving; who believe in the lovers of God and in the reality of Manifestation, and yet do not expect any spiritual <b>or</b> <b>material</b> reward; who do not let go the hand of Truth, and who, without being upset by calamities, bravely and wholeheartedly face all hardships with one hundred percent cheerfulness, and give no importance to caste, creed and religious ceremonies. This New Life will live by itself eternally, even if there is no one to live it.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} of fortified sites is often assumed {{to reflect a}} threat of warfare, but such fortified centres were multifunctional; they were also often the embodiment <b>or</b> <b>material</b> expression of the central places of the territories {{at the same time}} as being monuments glorifying and merging leading power.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} between science, engineering, and technology {{is not always}} clear. Science is systematic knowledge of the physical <b>or</b> <b>material</b> world gained through observation and experimentation. Technologies are not usually exclusively products of science, {{because they have to}} satisfy requirements such as utility, usability, and safety.|$|E
25|$|The Narayaniya {{section of}} the Mahabharata {{describes}} {{the ideas of the}} Pāñcarātras.

25|$|The lowest two tiers are characterised {{by a more}} {{straightforward}} {{exchange of}} sex for financial <b>or</b> <b>material</b> recompense. They are neither explicitly linked to government corruption, nor directly mediated through China's new commercial recreational business sector.

25|$|Hooke's {{equation}} holds (to some extent) in {{many other}} situations where an elastic body is deformed, such as wind blowing on a tall building, a musician plucking a string of a guitar, and the filling of a party balloon.

25|$|A {{road surface}} marking is {{any kind of}} device <b>or</b> <b>material</b> that is used on a road surface in order to convey {{official}} information for drivers and pedestrians. Edward N.

25|$|Object memory {{involves}} processing {{features of}} an object <b>or</b> <b>material</b> such as texture, color, size, and orientation.

It is a separate system from spatial memory and is not affected by interference from spatial tasks.|$|E
25|$|When {{teeth are}} knocked-out, {{they end up}} on an {{artificial}} surface: the floor, the ground <b>or</b> <b>material</b> such as carpeting. If the surface is hard, the tooth root cells will be traumatized. Since the cells remaining on the tooth root are very delicate, additional trauma to the tooth root cells must be avoided {{so as to avoid}} more tooth root cell crushing. This damage can occur while picking the tooth up and/or during transportation to the dentist.|$|E
