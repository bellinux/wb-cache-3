The method in writing this thesis is by comparing the data in DPPKA with the result of observation and interview to the parking tax payers, in this case, the administrator <b>of</b> <b>parking</b> services in Surakarta. The result of the research shows that the potential income <b>of</b> <b>parking</b> tax is bigger than the data of the realization <b>of</b> <b>parking</b> tax in DPPKA Surakarta. This is because the parking tax payers don’t report the actual income. Moreover, there are still many parking places that are not registered in DPPKA which have great potential to increase Local Revenue in Surakarta. It is recommended that DPPKA take actions to optimize the income <b>of</b> <b>parking</b> tax by conducting socialization and data re-collection to the parking tax payers, adding the number of DPPKA officer in the field so that the control towards the parking tax payers is more optimal, and giving fine to the tax payers who break the rule.
