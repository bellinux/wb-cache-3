The wealth of Glasgow’s merchants (and therefore of the city itself), whether it derived from tobacco, cotton, rum or sugar, depended on the labour of enslaved men, women and children. Until relatively recently, this was never discussed in much detail. Many of Glasgow’s powerful group of West India merchants, for example, had direct connections to plantations of one form or another and took little part in the burgeoning anti-slavery movement of the late 18th century.

That's why I {{think there is a}} strong case for an ETS but it's got to be the right ETS. It's got to be an ETS that protects Australian jobs and protects Australian industries... Abbott continued: [...] "what I was trying to do in that discussion, Laurie, was to talk around, if you like, a group of good, decent Liberals to support what I think is a reasonable compromise position. That's to say we will have an ETS but it will be an ETS that does the least possible damage to Australian jobs and Australian industries and the maximum possible protection against the possible risks of climate change... I am confronted by a hostile Liberal audience on this particular issue. I am trying to bring them around to support the position of the leader and the shadow cabinet.

5000|$|Strong Bad {{was based}} on the [...] "Strong Bads", a Lucha libre-style fighter team from the 1983 arcade video game Tag Team Wrestling, as the cartoon {{revolves}} largely around pop culture references.

We weren't planning <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> happening." [...] Along with most of the main characters of the website, Strong Bad debuted in the Brothers Chaps' children's book entitled [...] "The Homestar Runner Enters the Strongest Man in the World Contest". In this story, The Homestar Runner, Strong Bad (with a little help from The Cheat), and Pom Pom enter a strength competition, along with The Robot, Mr. Bland, Señor, and the Grape Fairie as the umpire, some characters that rarely appeared later in the series. The concept for this began in 1996 when both of The Brothers Chaps were looking for children's books. When they did not find any to their liking, they created their own as a parody. After creating a few characters and writing a plot, they made copies of the book and attempted to sell it. This hand-drawn book was the only incarnation of Strong Bad for several years. This did not succeed however, so the concept of a website with Homestar Runner and Pom Pom as the protagonists, and Strong Bad and The Cheat as the antagonists, became a reality in 2000.|$|E

30|$|The {{intertwined}} metric relation and holohedral point/plane symmetry-based {{hierarchy of}} the Bravais lattice types [28, 29] forms the backbone of both the underlying geometric model selection process and our recently developed G-AIC procedure [17, 18] that allows for subjective threshold-free Bravais lattice type classifications at the given noise level of {{a more or less}} 2 D-periodic image. For some future 2 D-periodic images with smaller noise levels, the relative likelihoods of assigned higher symmetric Bravais lattices may change somewhat.
