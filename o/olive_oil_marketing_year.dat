To this end, it utilizes monthly <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> price data and the statistical tool of copulas. The empirical results suggest that prices are likely to boom together but not to crash together; this is especially true for the prices of the two most important players, Italy (importer) and Spain (exporter).

30|$|Chemical and {{physical}} features (i.e., acidity or polyphenols) are traditionally relevant in differentiating <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> {{with respect to}} taste and nutritional properties.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present the {{research}} on competitive interdependency of Italian extra virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> through analysis of the sales scanner data. The paper analyses the strengths and weaknesses of Social Network Analysis approach in the <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>market.</b> The research addresses issues of three segments of high quality olive oils: popular extra virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> pdo/pgi extra virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oils,</b> and finally, the " 100 % Italian olive oil". The analysis results show several aspects. The extra virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>market</b> is highly polarized. There are large industrial companies with national products and other smes with regional products. While large enterprises have an intensive distribution in all grocery shops, in the distributions of smes the situation is much more complex. Some smes have a very strong sales organization, but fail to have similar market shares. Conversely, other small businesses, even if they have a low level of distribution, are able to gain market share more high. The analysis of sales by the sna approach remains a useful tool for smes which need to rationalize their presence in the grocery sector. Finally, the analysis shows segments of the market (pdo, pgi, bio, etc.) where smes may be able to compete with large industrial firms. ...|$|R
30|$|Based {{on these}} premises, the paper seeks at {{exploring}} {{the role of}} different quality clues {{in the creation of}} value in high segments of the Italian <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>market.</b> A hedonic price model has been estimated where price is explained by different quality clues. Despite the relevance of the <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> sector, only a few works have been devoted to assessing the most effective quality clues, although their number is noticeably increasing in recent years (Cabrera et al. 2015; Cacchiarelli et al. 2016; Karipidis et al. 2005; Romo Munoz et al. 2015; Gázquez-Abad and Sánchez-Pérez 2009; Roselli et al. 2016; Diotallevi 2010). The analysis here presented covers the EVOOs included in the oldest and most reputed Italian guide Flos Olei which each year reviews around 250 producers and their products coming from all Italian regions. The study covers three production years: 2012, 2013, and 2014. This allows to use both the OLS and a panel data model. The last may be considered the most original part of the work as to the authors’ knowledge no published paper so far employed hedonic price models based on panel data with reference to the <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>market.</b>|$|R

The study covers three production years (from 2012 to 2014) so that, besides the OLS estimations, a panel data analysis is also conducted. Main results indicate that consumers give value to features directly related to the product, as well as to the raw material used and to the production process; also, the kind of producer and the production area affect price. Moreover, the analysis shows the emerging role of experts in releasing valuable information about quality. On the contrary, European quality schemes, such as those for product origin and for organic production, do not bring additional value to consumers in the explored high market segments.|$|R

To increase sales and attract new users, <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> needs to be seen by UK consumers as an 'everyday' cooking oil, and enter into direct competition with standard vegetable oils. To achieve this, we argue in this paper that standard <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> needs to be repositioned and distanced from extra virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> in order to give customers sufficient cues to revise their opinions and consumption strategies.

The novelty of the paper lies not in the modelling approach but in the explicit consideration of the univariate characteristics of series that is included in the analysis. Since prices are non-stationary, cointegration among them has been tested. Results indicate that they are cointegrated and that homogeneity holds. As a result, relative prices are included in the imports demand system.

In contrast to previous studies, by considering a third-country market (a market different from that where production occurs), we can look simultaneously at COOL and GIs and separate the impacts of these two forms of geographical origin labels. We find that, {{within the context of}} a high quality value-added commodity such as extra virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> consumers value both COOL and GI labels. But, in terms of the fraction of consumers with positive preferences and willingness to pay, COOL labels are valued more by Canadian consumers compared to GI labels.
