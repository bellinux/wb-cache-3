5|$|Singapore {{inherited}} a Westminster {{system of government}} from the British. In such systems, there is an overlap between the executive and legislative branches of government. The head of state, who is the President <b>of</b> <b>Singapore,</b> {{is a member of}} both the executive Government <b>of</b> <b>Singapore</b> and the Parliament <b>of</b> <b>Singapore</b> but plays a minimal role in them. Executive power lies {{in the hands of the}} Cabinet, which is made up of the Prime Minister <b>of</b> <b>Singapore</b> (the head of government) and other Ministers. At the same time, the Prime Minister and Ministers are also Members of Parliament (MPs).|$|E

5|$|The British High Commissioner's role became {{that of an}} {{ambassador}} following Singapore's independence from Britain and merger with Malaysia in 1963. Apart from that {{the executive branch of}} the Singapore Government remained largely unchanged, although now it governed a state within a larger federation. However, with effect from 9 August 1965, Singapore left the Federation of Malaysia and became a fully independent republic. On separation from Malaysia, the Singapore Government retained its executive authority, and the executive authority of the Parliament of Malaysia ceased to extend to Singapore and vested in the Singapore Government. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the Supreme Head of State of Malaysia, also ceased to be the Supreme Head <b>of</b> <b>Singapore</b> and relinquished his sovereignty, jurisdiction, power and authority, executive or otherwise in respect <b>of</b> <b>Singapore,</b> which revested in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara <b>of</b> <b>Singapore.</b> The Republic <b>of</b> <b>Singapore</b> Independence Act 1965 then vested the executive authority <b>of</b> <b>Singapore</b> in the newly created post of President, and made it exercisable by him or by the Cabinet or by any Minister authorized by the Cabinet.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution {{defines the}} Government <b>of</b> <b>Singapore</b> as the President and the Cabinet <b>of</b> <b>Singapore.</b> The {{executive}} authority <b>of</b> <b>Singapore</b> is vested in the President and is exercisable by him {{or by the}} Cabinet <b>of</b> <b>Singapore</b> or any Minister authorized by the Cabinet. However, the President normally plays a nominal and largely ceremonial role {{in the executive branch}} of government. Although the President acts in his personal discretion in the exercise of certain functions as a check on the Cabinet and Parliament <b>of</b> <b>Singapore,</b> he is otherwise required to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet or of a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet. It is the Cabinet that has the general direction and control of the Government. As Singapore follows the Westminster system of government, the legislative agenda of Parliament is determined by the Cabinet. At the start of each new Parliamentary session, the President gives an address prepared by the Cabinet that outlines what the Cabinet intends to achieve in the session.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution of the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Singapore</b> Tribunal is {{an ad hoc}} {{tribunal}} {{established by}} Article 100 of the Constitution of the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Singapore.</b> Article 100 was introduced into the Constitution by the Constitution of the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Singapore</b> (Amendment No. 2) Act 1994, which was passed by Parliament on 25 August 1994 and assented to by President Ong Teng Cheong on 14 September 1994. It came into force on 1 October 1994.|$|E

5|$|The Constitution of the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Singapore</b> Tribunal was {{established}} in 1994 pursuant to Article 100 of the Constitution of the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Singapore.</b> Article 100 provides a mechanism for the President <b>of</b> <b>Singapore,</b> acting {{on the advice of}} the Singapore Cabinet, to refer to the Tribunal for its opinion any question as to the effect of any provision of the Constitution which has arisen or appears to likely to arise. Questions referred to the Tribunal may concern the validity of enacted laws or of bills that have not yet been passed by Parliament.|$|E

5|$|The Government <b>of</b> <b>Singapore</b> {{is defined}} by the Constitution of the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Singapore</b> to mean the Executive branch of government, which is made up of the President and the Cabinet <b>of</b> <b>Singapore.</b> Although the President acts in her {{personal}} discretion in the exercise of certain functions as a check on the Cabinet and Parliament <b>of</b> <b>Singapore,</b> her role is largely ceremonial. It is the Cabinet, composed of the Prime Minister and other Ministers appointed on his advice by the President, that generally directs and controls the Government. The Cabinet is formed by the political party that gains a simple majority in each general election.|$|E

5|$|After graduating, Shelley {{worked in}} Seremban in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia, until May 1965. He then {{returned}} to Singapore and began working for a company manufacturing pipes, subsequently starting his own machinery-importing business. He also served on the Public Service Commission (PSC) for over three decades, from 1976 to 2007. The PSC is a body created by the Constitution <b>of</b> <b>Singapore</b> that appoints, promotes, dismisses and exercises disciplinary control over public officers in Singapore.
