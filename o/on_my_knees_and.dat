500|$|... "I {{wanted to}} know how to dive into the base because I was getting {{strawberries}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> strawberries on my ass... I was thinking about head-first versus feet-first, and wondering which would save my body. With head-first I worried about pounding my shoulders and my hands, and with feet-first I would worry about my knees and my legs. I felt that running was more important to me, with my legs, so I started going head-first. I got my [...] technique from airplanes...I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it woke me up. Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it. So when I hit the ground, if you didn't have the tag down, I was by you. No matter if the ball beat me, I was by you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anthony herself said, [...] "Work {{and worship}} are one with me. I {{can not imagine}} a God of the {{universe}} made happy by my getting down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> calling him 'great.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{got down}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> I did say 'thank you' to God. And {{right then and}} there joy and peace came into my soul. I knew then what it was to be 'born again,' and the Bible which had been so dry to me before, became everything." ...|$|E
60|$|Unfolding the {{manuscript}} I spread it carefully <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> began to read.|$|R
6000|$|... "Father's {{going to}} read to us, father's {{going to read}} to us," [...] she cried, finally clambering up <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> snuggling against me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Gamaliel," [...] {{she said}} sharply, [...] "straighten up and don't talk {{nonsense}} to me. I've had you <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> I knew {{your mother and}} father." ...|$|R
2500|$|Born in Kenansville, North Carolina English {{was raised}} by parents Aubine and Grace English, in a town called North East, near Wallace, North Carolina. English {{performed}} in his family's singing group, The Singing Samaritans, from 1972 until 1980. After graduating from high school, he joined The Singing Americans, where he shortened his name to Mike English, later going back to Michael. He left the group in 1982 and joined The Goodmans. At {{about the same time}} he married his first wife Lisa Bailey and they had a daughter Megan who was born in late 1984. After that, he joined a regional group, The Gospel Couriers, for about six months until he rejoined The Singing Americans. It was then that he had his first big success in southern gospel music with the live recording of what would become his signature song, [...] "I Bowed <b>On</b> <b>My</b> <b>Knees</b> (<b>And</b> Cried Holy)".|$|E
60|$|She {{pointed to}} the door. Then I felt a sudden revulsion. I fell <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> seized her hands.|$|E
6000|$|Hail Christmas! <b>On</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> fowl I fall: [...] For greater {{grace and}} better gravy call. [...] Vive l'Humbug!--that's to say, God bless us all! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Think of it, Thirza--that child! Why, it's {{only a year}} or two {{since she}} used to sit <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> tickle <b>my</b> face with her hair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} seen {{anything}} like this," [...] Isobel said softly. I looked up from the writing-pad <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> she met <b>my</b> glance with a smile of contrition.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I had, I {{probably}} should have put you <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> told you fairy tales, or cut dolls for you out of this bark, instead of sitting respectfully silent and making a basket for your stores." ...|$|R
60|$|Taking {{this as an}} intimation to {{obey the}} old man's commands, I went down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees,</b> <b>and</b> touched my lips to the hand he extended.|$|E
60|$|Just {{then two}} or three big bubbles rose to the surface, and silently exploded. Quick as {{lightning}} I dropped <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> raised my arms.|$|E
6000|$|She said, 'I {{went to my}} room, trembling. I {{fell down}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees,</b> <b>and</b> prayed to my heavenly Father to have mercy on them. I thought, [...] "What shall I do?"' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But you won't {{leave us}} now, will you?" [...] said little Ivanka pitifully, getting <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> {{nestling}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> breast; [...] "you {{will stay with}} father, won't you, and help {{to take care of}} us? I'm so frightened!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was only}} {{thinking}} that I {{should have a}} doll to match your knife. I feel as if I should enjoy trotting a staring fright <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> singing Hush-a-by. But I fancy even your magic cannot produce such a thing,--can it, my lad?" ...|$|R
60|$|I shall {{come and}} sit here often myself and work. Indeed, I am writing now, with <b>my</b> book <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> {{listening}} to the talk of three old men who are sitting beside me. They seem to do nothing all day but sit here and talk.|$|R
60|$|I dropped <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> fell {{to work on}} {{his ankle}} bonds. Whack came something--I know not what--and splashed the livid streamlet into drops about us. Far away on our right a piping and {{whistling}} began.|$|E
6000|$|... "Honourable!" [...] {{said the}} widow with bitter scorn. [...] "Oh, brother, {{what is this}} you call honour? If my boy has been guilty, he must marry her. I would go down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> pray him to do so." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had lost}} myself with my elbows <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> {{my head in}} my hands, but I heard the words distinctly. I heard also the silence which ensued. I sat up and took the {{responsibility}} of the answer on myself.|$|E
60|$|I rested <b>my</b> chin <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> looked {{before me}} on the ground. I had been talking until then to hold her; but I was now not sorry she should go: an {{impression}} is a thing so delicate to produce and so easy to overthrow! Presently she seemed to make an effort.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come {{into the}} tent. Now then, darling," [...] said the captain; [...] "sit <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> {{tell me all}} about it. Polly has seen {{something}} in her rambles that has made her cry," [...] he explained to Jack, Wilkins, {{and the rest of the}} party who chanced to come in while he was speaking. [...] "Let us hear about it." ...|$|R
60|$|As for the baby, he is a bright, good-humored little fellow; {{and he has}} {{one great}} merit in my estimation--he bears no {{resemblance}} to his father. I saw his mother's features when I first took him <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> looked at his face, lifted to mine in grave surprise. The baby and I are certain to get on well together.|$|R
6000|$|... "Orthodox Christianity? penance, asceticism, self-abnegation--repression--falling <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> {{seeking a}} {{forgiveness}} {{out of all}} proportion to the trespass, and filled {{with a sense of}} total depravity? If I did that I should lose myself--the only valuable thing I've got." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{perceived}} for {{the first}} time that one of the windows facing the course was broken, and my relief was great. I went down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> helped him in his search. We ran the ball to earth finally inside the piano.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is lying!" [...] Lenora insisted. [...] "I {{tell you}} there's another {{creature}} there, something we don't understand. Let me bring the Electro-thought transference apparatus; let us read his mind. If I am wrong, I {{will go down}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> beg for forgiveness." ...|$|E
40|$|Message on card reads "France 9 / 5 / 18 Dear Win, Here is {{some more}} {{statuary}} for you.

6000|$|... "But you {{are under}} my hoof, for all that," [...] said he, turning upon her, with a savage grin; [...] "that's one comfort. So, sit down here <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>my</b> dear, <b>and</b> hear to reason," [...] said he, laying hold on her wrist.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wish Romer were here. I'd let him {{shoot at}} that bear," [...] I replied. Then I got down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> aiming {{as closely as}} {{possible}} I fired. The report rang out in the stillness, making hollow echoes. We heard the bullet pat somewhere. So did the bear hear it. Curiously he looked around, as if something had struck near him. But scared he certainly was not. Then I shot four times in quick succession.|$|R
60|$|I flung myself {{before him}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees,</b> <b>and</b> with floods of tears besought him to release me from this engagement, assuring him that my cowardice was abject, {{and that in}} every point of intellect and {{character}} I was his hopeless and derisible inferior.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye! mad!" [...] he said bitterly, [...] "mad when I {{feel the}} magic of your eyes {{stealing}} my honour away! [...] . . . mad, indeed! for with a fellow-creature's blood still warm upon that dainty hand, I long to fall <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> cover it with kisses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “But mine is a peer of Ireland,” says Mistress Beatrix, tossing her head. “Let {{people know}} their places. I suppose {{you will have}} me go down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> ask a blessing of Mr. Thomas Tusher, that has just been made a curate, and whose mother was a waiting-maid.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But you can! You're all right. I {{saw that}} from the first. Don't go back on me now or I shall go to pieces like the Drummond Castle. I beg your pardon, old man; but, you see, you do know the dog. I'll prove it. What's that dog doing? Come on! You know.' A tremor shook him, {{and he put his}} hand <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> whispered with great meaning: 'I'll letter or halve it with you. There! You begin.' ...|$|R
60|$|Any how, I {{sat with}} <b>my</b> elbow <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> face upon my hand, {{looking into the}} fire, as those two talked about my going away, and about {{what they should do}} without me, and all that. And {{whenever}} I caught one of them looking at me, though never so pleasantly (and they often looked at me,--particularly Biddy), I felt offended: as if they were expressing some mistrust of me. Though Heaven knows they never did by word or sign.|$|R
60|$|She {{stretched}} out her hand, and I went down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> {{put it to}} my lips. I had not considered how I should take leave of her; it came naturally {{to me at the}} moment to do this. She looked at Sarah Pocket with triumph in her weird eyes, and so I left my fairy godmother, with both her hands on her crutch stick, standing {{in the midst of the}} dimly lighted room beside the rotten bride-cake that was hidden in cobwebs.|$|R
