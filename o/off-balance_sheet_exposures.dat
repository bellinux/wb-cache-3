40|$|While leases {{are widely}} used to finance {{productive}} assets in the U. S, lease accounting has been sharply criticized for providing incomplete and unreliable information to investors because many leases are arranged <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> as operating leases. As such, a higher cost of equity capital may be required by investors to compensate for unrecorded liabilities and imperfect information. In this dissertation, I provide the empirical evidence as to how equity market participants perceive the <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> leases. ^ First, I investigate the firm characteristics that determine the choice on operating versus capital leases. By summarizing the results from prior literature, I identify the determinants from three areas: operating risks, financial constraints and tax-driven incentives. The results suggest that both economic and opportunistic reasons drive a firm 2 ̆ 7 s lease choice. Specifically, fast-growing, financially constrained, or low-tax firms opt for <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> operating leases. ^ Second, I {{examine the impact of}} <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> operating leases on the cost of equity, and whether it would be different from that of capital leases or conventional debt. The results suggest that <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> operating leases are “value relevant” as indicated by an increased cost of equity capital being associated with greater use of operating leases. However, investors also seem to suffer from the <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> position of disclosed operating leases. The leverage effect of operating leases is largely attenuated relative to capital leases and conventional debt. ^ Third, I explore the role of information intermediaries in compensation for the deficiency in accounting for leases. The results indicate that the cost of equity, with respect to the use of <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> leases, diminishes in greater analyst followings and the existence of credit ratings. Specifically, the diminishing effect of 2 ̆ 7 financial analysts is more pronounced on <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> operating leases than that on capital leases and conventional debt. Lastly, whether a firm is audited by a big 4 / 5 / 6 / 8 firm appears to have no effect on either off- or on-balance sheet leases. ^ This study contributes to the Financial Accounting Standard Board 2 ̆ 7 s lease accounting project and helps investors assess the risk of firms with <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> leases. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Against the {{background}} of the acknowledged importance of off-balancesheet exposures in the sub prime crisis, we seek to investigate whether this was a new phenomenon or common to earlier crises. Using a logit approach to predicting banking crises in 14 OECD countries we find a significant impact of a proxy for the ratio of banks ‟ off-balance-sheet activity to total (off and on balance sheet) activity, as well as capital and liquidity ratios, the current account balance and GDP growth. These results are robust to the exclusion of the most crisis prone countries in our model. For early warning purposes we show that real house price growth is a good proxy for off balance sheet activity prior to the sub-prime episode. Variables capturing off-balance sheet activity have been neglected in most early warning models to date. We consider it essential that regulators take into account the results for crisis prediction in regulating banks and their <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>exposures,</b> and thus controlling their contribution to systemic risk...|$|E

Cross-border bank lending to entities domiciled in OFCs is around US$ 850 billion, double the amount ten years ago. The Bank of England has therefore been exploring whether financial flows through OFCs can provide insights into developments, and so potential risks, in the international financial system. It seems they may be able to do so, although there are issues about data availability. This article reports on some of the work to date. BANKS ’ ON- AND <b>OFF-BALANCE</b> <b>SHEET</b> <b>exposures</b> to counterparties in other countries provide one linkage through which economic and financial shocks can be transmitted. For this reason, the Bank monitors aggregate cross-border banking exposures and uses this information to try to assess potential risks to stability 1.

These claims have almost doubled since 1990 (Chart 1) mirroring the growth in global cross-border banking activity which, with an interruption following the collapse of Long Term Capital Management (LTCM), has been rapid since the mid- 1990 s.

40|$|The present paper {{analyzes}} {{two important}} aspects in the amplification {{process of the}} recent financial crisis to the real economy, that is the securitisation of financial assets (and in particular of loans and mortgages) {{and the growth of}} bank off-balance sheet activities, for instance through the development of Special Purpose Vehicles, with specific attention to the US context. In particular, this work aims to examine whether and how the increase in off-balance sheet credit exposure to credit derivatives, mainly due to loan securitisation, may have affected the growth rate of loans over the past few years, also by distinguishing different categories of loans. For this purpose, we present the results of a panel fixed-effect estimation and of a panel VAR analysis, using quarterly data from the balance sheets of 39 US commercial banks and for a period between 1998 and 2008. The results show that a rise in off-balance credit exposure may have – after some time lags - a negative impact on the growth rate of bank lending, due to the potential and actual losses related to the off-balance sheet activities. However, the effects on the single categories of loans depend on their maturity: the negative effect due to an increase in off-balance sheet exposure is stronger for long-term loans, like mortgages or real estate loans, while some positive impact on bank lending may arise for short-term loans, such as commercial and industrial loans, because of the liquidity/maturity transformation function associated with securitisation activities. The results of the paper regarding the impact of an increase in <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>exposures</b> on bank deleveraging process may have some relevant policy implications for the design of financial regulation, particularly in the area of shadow banking, supporting the current policy initiatives for the revision of risk weights in securitisation exposures {{as well as for the}} implementation of consolidation regimes concerning bank off-balance sheet activities. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we {{investigate}} the leverage cycle in Luxembourg?s banking sector using individual bank-level data for the period 2003 Q 1 to 2010 Q 1. We discuss the mechanics behind the leverage cycle in Luxembourg?s banks and show that these banks predominantly adjust leverage by changing both loans and deposits. One of our findings is that Luxembourg?s banks have a procyclical leverage. This procyclicality is not due to marking-to-market but because Luxembourg?s banks are liquidity providers to the EU banking sector. This also explains the different evolution of leverage compared to the US commercial banks (Adrian and Shin [1]) that, even though their balance sheet structure {{is similar to that}} of the Luxembourgish banks, target a constant leverage. To further understand what drives leverage in Luxembourg?s banks we empirically investigate the role of bank characteristics as well as real, financial and expectation variables that proxy for macroeconomic conditions in the pre-crisis and crisis period. We find that <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>exposures</b> have different effects in the pre-crisis and crisis period, and that the share of liquid assets in the portfolio only affects the amount of security holdings. In terms of macroeconomic variables, we find that the Euribor-OIS spread is a significant driver of the build-up in leverage in the pre-crisis period. The reason is that most banks in Luxembourg are either branches or subsidiaries. This, firstly, makes leverage a less relevant indicator of riskiness for investors. Secondly, it implies that in times of liquidity shortages, mother companies or groups demand further liquidity from their branch or subsidiary. The downturn in leverage during the crisis can be accredited to reductions in expectations, which we proxy by an economic sentiment indicator. It can also be explained by increasing bond prices which induce depositors to shift their funds from bank deposits into bonds. We find no important role for GDP growth. leverage dynamics, banking sector, GMM estimation, crisis effect...|$|E

40|$|The {{turbulence}} {{in credit}} and funding {{markets in the}} second half of 2007 is disturbing evidence that risk dispersion in financial markets has been less effective than expected. Investors appear to have acquired risks that they did not understand. Much more worrisome, however, is the evidence that major financial firms did not succeed in shedding risks so much as in transferring them among their own business lines, resulting in an unintended concentration of risks on their own balance sheets. In order to restore confidence in the near term, and to put credit creation on a more sustainable path in the future, supervisory authorities, central banks and governments will first need to understand why the much-vaunted dispersion of risk fell so far short of expectations. The “reluctance to lend” which underlies these strains in money markets was widely attributed to concerns about the financial condition of borrowers, as a consequence of uncertainty about the value of assets on the borrowers’ balance sheets, and also to insuffi cient attention to liquidity management by financial firms. But the focus on uncertainty about borrowers ignores the awkward fact that the major financial intermediaries are both lenders and borrowers themselves and their reluctance to lend significantly reflects a defensive reaction to their own uncertainties about their own balance sheets. Better stress testing for liquidity as well as solvency would certainly be beneficial. Yet a major cause of the strains in credit and funding markets has been the apparent inability of many firms to anticipate the interaction of their various on- and <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>exposures</b> and, particularly, to understand the velocity of their off-balance sheet activities and how these affected their overall exposures. In considering potential remedies to the credit market’s turbulence and to the apparent failure of risk dispersion, the authorities should first reflect on their own role in the trend of pushing risks off of bank balance sheets. ...|$|E

It traces the impact national regulators in can have on the kind of engagements their banks have in these markets by analysing the differ-ent national regulations in Germany, France, Spain and the Netherlands and the respective engagement of banks from these countries in that market. The overall analysis demonstrates the large scope of action national regulators have in regulating the off-balance sheet en-gagements of their banks. National Regulators are much more than agents enforcing inter-national treaties, rather they are interpreters of international accords in the frame of na-tional law, which leaves much space for interpretation. This implies that national parliamen-tarians, which are interested in increasing the financial stability of their respective banking system, could and should engage in a close supervision of the actions of their national bank-ing regulators in this field in order to avoid regulatory capture. For this purpose they can use international comparisons by international organizations such as the OECD, international auditing firms and the rating agencies. The paper closes by showing the most recent changes in the treatment of off-balance sheet engagements of banks on the international level in order to sensitize the readers to potential issues of interpretation involved in their interpre-tation.
