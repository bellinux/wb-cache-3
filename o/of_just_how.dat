25|$|Perhaps the {{ultimate}} example of U.S. imperialism and expansionist ideas {{along the border}} is the U.S.–Mexican War. From 1846 to 1848, the United States {{was involved in a}} series of many battles with Mexico with the intention of claiming New Mexico and California as part of the United States, and also getting Mexico to recognize Texas as an official U.S. state. This two-year-long war was a prime illustration <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> far the U.S. would go to achieve its ambitious imperialistic goals.|$|E
25|$|The {{events of}} Use of Weapons are an example <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> dirty Special Circumstances {{will play in}} order to get their way and the {{conspiracy}} {{at the heart of the}} plot of Excession demonstrates how at least some Minds are prepared to risk killing sentient beings when they conclude that these actions are beneficial for the long term good. Special Circumstances represents a very small fraction of Contact, which itself is only a small fraction of the entire Culture, making it comparable again to size and influence of modern intelligence agencies.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} blackboard with {{arrival and}} departure information by Track 36 {{was replaced by}} an electromechanical display in the main concourse over the ticket windows that displayed times and track numbers of arriving and departing trains. Dubbed a Solari board after its Italian manufacturer, it contained rows of flip panels that displayed train information, and became a New York institution, as its many displays would flap simultaneously to reflect changes in train schedules, an indicator <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> busy Grand Central was. A small example {{of this type of}} device hangs in the Museum of Modern Art as an example of outstanding industrial design.|$|E

25|$|Andrew {{was also}} on-air during the 2007 summer floods {{and found himself}} {{presenting}} a news programme from 7pm until midnight instead of his new music programme, receiving top praise from Mark Thompson, director-general of the BBC at the time, who said: “The feedback you’ve received from your audience has offered ample testimony <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> essential that service has been to so many people’s lives. We could never hope to keep them informed and connected {{were it not for}} the kind of efforts you've made, and the professionalism and creativity that you've demonstrated”.

Robert Weatherwax, Rudd's son, later recalled, [...] "It hit him very hard when Pal died. He buried him in a special place on the ranch and would often visit the grave. Dad would never again watch an MGM Lassie movie. He just couldn't bear to see Pal. He didn't want to have to be {{reminded}} <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> much he loved that dog." ...|$|E
500|$|Dawkins {{suggests}} that atheists should be proud, not apologetic, stressing that atheism {{is evidence of}} a healthy, independent mind. He hopes that the more atheists identify themselves, the more the public will become aware <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> many people are nonbelievers, thereby reducing the negative opinion of atheism among the religious majority. [...] Inspired by the gay rights movement, he endorsed the Out Campaign to encourage atheists worldwide to declare their stance publicly. He supported the UK's first atheist advertising initiative, the Atheist Bus Campaign in 2008, which aimed to raise funds to place atheist advertisements on buses in the London area.|$|E

500|$|The Aberdeen Press & Journal {{described}} the episode as [...] "one of the darkest episodes of the Simpsons". In their {{section on the}} episode in the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood comment: [...] "Undoubtedly the most disturbing episode of the series, with Bart's nightmare of losing his soul— illustrated by a macabre playground where all the souls of his playmates are visible, and his is tagging along with Milhouse— more frightening than funny. ... An illustration <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> far the series could go by this point." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2005, New Nation ranked Confusion 91st {{on their}} list of the [...] "Top 100 Best Albums by Black Artists". In his 2008 book 1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die, music {{journalist}} Tom Moon wrote that it is both one of Kuti's best albums and [...] "a demonstration <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> rousing Afro-Beat's deftly interlocked rhythms can be." [...] In 2010, the album was bundled again with Gentleman by Knitting Factory Records {{as a part of}} their extensive reissue of Kuti's 45-album discography. Michaelangelo Matos of Paste magazine gave it a score of [...] "9.3/10" [...] and cited it as the essential release in both the reissue and Kuti's catalog: [...] "an oasis in a sandpaper-like catalog." ...|$|E
500|$|McFarland praised Kaitlin Olson's {{portrayal}} of Brenda, however, stating [...] "Olson got some laughs out <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> deep Brenda’s denial went, finding every possible excuse to blame herself and exonerate Jeff. It made her endearing and easily likeable, every bit the opposite from Olson's {{place in the}} rogue’s gallery of misanthropy on It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia." [...] He ended his review by comparing it to the fellow FOX animation series The Simpsons, noting, [...] "The Simpsons managed {{to find the right}} blend with Sideshow Bob episodes, or in the aching sadness of Homer and Marge's marriage, but as has been said ad infinitum, Family Guy hasn't mastered that combination {{in the same way as}} the original." [...] He graded the episode as C+.|$|E

Wiley of Blogcritics wrote: [...] "by {{focusing}} {{on that last}} ambiguous parting shot from creator David Chase, we run the risk <b>of</b> forgetting <b>just</b> <b>how</b> beautifully structured and executed an hour of television 'Made in America' is" [...] and ranked it as the eighth-best series finale ever.|$|R
500|$|According to Michael Goldfarb, the Mortara {{controversy}} provided [...] "an embarrassing example <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> out {{of touch}} with modern times the Church was", and demonstrated that [...] "Pope Pius IX was incapable of bringing the Church into the modern era". Kertzer takes a similar line: [...] "The refusal to return Edgardo contributed to the growing sense that the Pope's role as temporal ruler, with his own police force, was an anachronism that could no longer be maintained." [...] Kertzer {{goes so far as to}} suggest that as a primary motivator for the French change of stance that precipitated Italian unification in 1859–61, this [...] "story of an illiterate servant girl, a grocer, and a little Jewish child from Bologna" [...] may well have changed the course of both Italian and Church history.|$|E
500|$|In {{the album}} closer, [...] "Street Choir", Morrison repeats the questions, [...] "Why did {{you let me}} down / And now that things are better off / Why do you come around". Because of these lyrics Heylin wrote that [...] "such songs [...] were spawned by an {{increasing}} awareness <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> badly ripped off he had been". Ken Brooks {{has said that the}} lyric [...] "Move On Up" [...] is another reference on the album to a Curtis Mayfield song. The track prominently features Keith Johnson's trumpet and Morrison's harmonica. Writer Brian Hinton described the lyrics as perversely bitter, while Jon Landau wrote that [...] "Street Choir" [...] was one of the [...] "two or three finest songs" [...] of Morrison's career because of its [...] "musical and poetic energy".|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} acclaim surrounding the album also helped to shift {{attention away from}} the melodious, synth-driven, and funk-induced G-funk subgenre, which dominated the charts for some time after Dr. Dre's The Chronic (1992). Citing the example of Snoop Dogg's wildly popular Doggystyle (released six months prior to Nas' debut) author Matthew Gasteier writes, [...] "The first thing immediately noticeable about the [...] review, is that, like essentially every other review about Illmatic in publications like Vibe, Spin, Rolling Stones, and The New York Times, it mentions Snoop Doggy Dogg's Doggystyle in the first paragraph." [...] That nearly every reviewer felt the need to contextualize their response to Illmatic within the frame of West Coast G-Funk [...] "is a reminder <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> pervasive the style was within the hip hop world and the music community as a whole." ...|$|E

500|$|Retrospective reviews {{have been}} positive. AllMusic wrote that [...] "Jethro Tull's first LP-length epic is a {{masterpiece}} {{in the annals}} of progressive rock, {{and one of the few}} works of its kind that still holds up decades later." [...] Jordan Blum of PopMatters thinks that the album [...] "paved the way for modern progressive rock" [...] and [...] "today, it represents not only a pinnacle achievement for Jethro Tull, but also a concrete example <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> adventurous and free artists used to be." [...] Record Collector reviewer writes that [...] "today, free from the irrelevant context of misdiagnosis and derision that dogged it on its original release, the album sounds like nothing less than an Olympian feat of composition and musicianship." [...] According to Modern Drummer reviewer Adam Budofsky, [...] "it remains so elevated in progressive rock fans' hearts and minds forty years later is a testament to its quality." ...|$|E
500|$|Benjamin Lee of The Guardian {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} five stars, writing that [...] "despite the film {{constantly}} informing you <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> incredibly important everything all is, it's disappointingly difficult to truly care about what's taking place." [...] He blames Sorkin's [...] "dominating" [...] script, arguing that [...] "the dialogue stifles" [...] and that [...] "the actors are tasked with trying to wrangle enough breathing space to offer up something of their own." [...] He also feels that while it is [...] "Boyle's best film for years," [...] his direction [...] "plays second fiddle" [...] to a script that verges {{on a kind of}} [...] "Apple-sponsored hero iWorship." [...] Joe Nocera of The New York Times, who knew Jobs well, took issue with [...] "how little the film {{has to do with the}} flesh and blood Steve Jobs." [...] Characterizing the movie as pure [...] "fiction", he went on to say, [...] "In ways both large and small, Sorkin − as well as Michael Fassbender, the actor who plays Jobs − has failed to capture him in any meaningful sense." ...|$|E

Nonetheless, he praised the compilation for highlighting [...] "the sheer athleticism and skill that propelled Carey’s early work. She took very simple songs—both in terms of arrangements and theme—rooted in pop, gospel, and R and turned them into feats of strength, granting them dynamism and drama with a voice that juggled power, clarity, and agility with ease".|$|E
5000|$|There is {{the problem}} <b>of</b> {{determining}} <b>just</b> <b>how</b> many are needed to have a majority or consensus. Is merely greater than 50% significant enough and why?

500|$|Wirkola said, [...] "I have {{a strong}} memory from my {{childhood}} <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> dark and gruesome their tale was and I wondered {{what would have happened}} to the two of them when they grew up? They had this dark past and this intense hatred of witches. So as I thought about it, it made sense to me that of course they would be fated to become great witch hunters. We wanted it to feel like this could be happening 300 years ago but at the same time, there is a modern spin on all the action, characters and weaponry. It was a fun way to make a classical world feel fresh." [...] Wirkola said that he originally came with that idea in 2007 while studying film and television at Bond University in Australia, when he wanted to make it as just a short film, and that the film school director Simon Hunter advised him: [...] "Tom, don't ever speak of the idea again until you are in front of a Hollywood producer and I guarantee you will sell it." ...|$|E
500|$|Cranston's {{performance}} {{was a frequent}} topic in the critiques. Even prior to the airing of the episode, James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly suggested that the actor's voice would be perfect for an animated television series. VanDerWerff and Carp were amongst the journalists who issued favorable assessments of Cranston's acting. Carp noted that [...] "Cranston's work is even more impressive {{when you consider that}} he not only plays the hero and villain but manages to be funny as both." [...] In addressing [...] "Part II", Carp concluded that [...] "as early as the stunning end of the world sequence, the actor plants the hint of suppressed craziness in Spaceman Drake and it was soon obvious that the just crew would not only be manning a mission to help him combat the mutineers but probably get wrapped up in this nut's dream to terra form Mars." [...] For VanDerWerff, [...] "Cranston is the very best kind of guest voice, fully inhabiting his character but also {{having a lot of fun}} with the jokes. It’s a nice reminder <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> funny Cranston can be, and I hope he gets even more bizarre stuff to do next week." [...] Jonah Gardner of Ology later said, [...] "Bryan Cranston remains a god among men." ...|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{felt that}} the story and {{dialogue}} were weak, while the visuals were spectacular. Kenneth Turan's review in the Los Angeles Times was particularly scathing. Dismissing the emotive elements, he stated, [...] "What really brings on the tears is Cameron's insistence that writing this kind of movie is within his abilities. Not only is it not, {{it is not even}} close.", and later claimed that the only reason that the film won Oscars was because of its box office total. Barbara Shulgasser of The San Francisco Examiner gave Titanic one star out of four, citing a friend as saying, [...] "The number of times in this unbelievably badly written script that the two [...] refer to each other by name was an indication <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> dramatically the script lacked anything more interesting for the actors to say." [...] Also, filmmaker Robert Altman called it [...] "the most dreadful piece of work I've ever seen in my entire life". In his 2012 study of the lives of the passengers on the Titanic, historian Richard Davenport-Hines said, [...] "Cameron's film diabolized rich Americans and educated English, anathematizing their emotional restraint, good tailoring, punctilious manners and grammatical training, while it made romantic heroes of the poor Irish and the unlettered".|$|E
5000|$|On May 15, 2017, {{members of}} the Minority Caucus of the Metropolitan Council of Nashville and Davidson County said the {{incident}} was [...] "reflective <b>of</b> not <b>just</b> <b>how</b> the ‘IT’ city views and treats its black citizens, but also black elected officials."
