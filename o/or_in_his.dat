5|$|Jesé {{is able to}} play {{across the}} front line, {{operating}} either as an attacking midfielder, second striker or centre-forward, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> favoured position out on the wing. During his time at the Castilla, Jesé was often deployed in a false 9 role in the team's 4–3–3 formation, and regularly switched flanks due to his ability to use both feet. In 2013, {{in his role as}} the club's sporting director at the time, Zinedine Zidane declared himself an admirer of Jesé's direct style of football and goal scoring ability. Following Jesé's promotion to Real Madrid's first team in 2013, manager Carlo Ancelotti played him in a winger position, where he could cut inside from the wing both with the ball and without, to create chances and score goals.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of the diocese affecting both clergy and laity was vested entirely in the bishop, who appointed officers to the ecclesiastical, criminal and civil courts. The bishop, assisted by his chapter, produced the church laws and regulations for the bishopric and these were enforced at occasional diocesan synods by the bishop <b>or,</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> absence, by the dean. Appointed officials adjudicated at consistory courts looking at matters affecting tithes, marriages, divorces, widows, orphans, wills and other related legal matters. In Moray, these courts were held in Elgin and Inverness. By 1452 the Bishop of Moray held all his lands in one regality and had Courts of Regality presided over by Bailiffs and Deputies to ensure the payment of revenues from his estates.|$|E

5|$|When Donnchadh adopted or {{was given}} the title of earl (Latin: comes), <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own {{language}} mormaer, is a debated question. Historian Alan Orr Anderson argued that he began using the title of comes between 1214 and 1216, based on Donnchadh's appearance as a witness to two charters issued by Thomas de Colville; the first, known as Melrose 193 (this being its number in Cosmo Innes's printed version of the cartulary), was dated by Anderson to 1214. In this charter, Donnchadh has no title. By contrast Donnchadh was styled comes in a charter dated by Anderson to 1216, Melrose 192.|$|E

25|$|Julius and Claudius {{were two}} Roman family names; in {{classical}} Latin, they came second. Roman family names were inherited from father to son, but a Roman aristocrat could – either during his life <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> will – adopt an heir if he lacked a natural son. In accordance with Roman naming conventions, the adopted son would replace his original family name {{with the name}} of his adopted family. A famous example of this custom is Julius Caesar's adoption of his great-nephew, Gaius Octavius.|$|E

Possibly out of vengeance for the death of Iphigenia, Clytemnestra plotted with her lover to kill Agamemnon. Cassandra foresaw this murder, and warned Agamemnon, but he disregarded her. He was killed, either at a feast <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> bath, according to different versions. Cassandra was also killed. Agamemnon's son Orestes, who had been away, returned and conspired with his sister Electra to avenge their father. He killed Clytemnestra and Aegisthus and succeeded to his father's throne.|$|E
25|$|Skilled as an {{administrator}} and ruler, Charles organized {{what would become}} the medieval European government: a system of fiefdoms, loyal to barons, counts, dukes and ultimately the King, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> case, simply maior domus and princeps et dux Francorum. ("Mayor of the Palace, Duke of the Franks") His close coordination of church with state began the medieval pattern for such government. He created {{what would become the}} first western standing army since the fall of Rome by his maintaining a core of loyal veterans around which he organized the normal feudal levies. In essence, he changed Europe from a horde of barbarians fighting with one another, to an organized state.|$|E
25|$|Al-Jazzar {{was born}} in Stolac, Bosnia Eyalet. One source lists the year of his birth as 1720, but {{historian}} Thomas Philipp believes {{it is more likely}} that he {{was born in}} the 1730s. At the age of 20, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> late adolescent years, around 1755, he moved to Constantinople. In al-Jazzar's biography by Volney in Voyage, al-Jazzar fled Bosnia at the age of 16 because he raped his sister-in-law, while in Olivier's account, al-Jazzar fled at age 17 after stabbing a woman who did not accede to his desires. According to Olivier, he then began work as a sailor and drifted throughout Anatolia before selling himself to a Turkish slave trader. Al-Jazzar subsequently converted to Islam in Egypt.|$|E

25|$|The Court {{operates}} in two divisions, where either three or five justices sit {{to hear a}} case before the Court. For especially important cases, the President of the Court may decide that the bench be constituted by seven justices. When a case is heard by five or seven justices, these shall usually be the most senior justices on the Court. The main rule is that cases are presented orally before the Supreme Court, and the court sessions are generally open to the public. The President of the Supreme Court presides over the session <b>or,</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> absence, the Vice-President. If neither of them is hearing the case, the most senior justice in session will preside.|$|E
25|$|In the Regal era, a rex sacrorum (king of {{the sacred}} rites) {{supervised}} regal and state rites {{in conjunction with the}} king (rex) <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> absence, and announced the public festivals. He had little or no civil authority. With the abolition of monarchy, the collegial power and influence of the Republican pontifices increased. By the late Republican era, the flamines were supervised by the pontifical collegia. The rex sacrorum had become a relatively obscure priesthood with an entirely symbolic title: his religious duties still included the daily, ritual announcement of festivals and priestly duties within two or three of the latter but his most important priestly role – the supervision of the Vestals and their rites – fell to the more politically powerful and influential pontifex maximus.|$|E
