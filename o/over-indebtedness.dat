50|$|While it is {{challenging}} to define <b>over-indebtedness,</b> definitions of <b>over-indebtedness</b> {{tend to have}} a few core elements in common. The first one refers to the capacity to meet the expenses associated with the contracted financial commitments. <b>Over-indebtedness</b> implies an inability to meet such recurring expenses. Second, this inability is structural. This is the time dimension, which holds that the definition must capture persistent and ongoing financial problems and exclude one-off occurrences that arise due to forgetfulness, for instance. The third core element refers to standard of living. The household must be unable to meet contracted commitments without reducing its minimum standard of living expenses. Fourth, comes illiquidity. The household is unable to remedy the situation by recourse to (financial and non-financial) assets and other financial sources such as credit. Lastly, all contracted financial commitments are included, among them mortgage and consumer credit commitments, utility and telephone bills as well as rent payments (recurring expenses).|$|E

50|$|Unfortunately, in South Africa, {{too many}} people with too little money have been given too much credit. This {{ultimately}} leads to <b>over-indebtedness</b> which results in a never-ending circle of frustration for the consumer who can never repay his debts.|$|E
50|$|Whilst credit allows {{access to}} {{products}} or services that cannot be acquired out of a single month’s income, {{it can also be}} a dangerous instrument that can lead to high levels of debt and indebtedness.It is quite easy for credit to lead to financial hardship and destroy a household’s wealth. Taking on extra loans in order to pay back existing loans can lead people into a debt spiral out of which {{it may be difficult to}} escape. <b>Over-indebtedness</b> has a negative impact on families and has in some extreme cases even led to family suicides. <b>Over-indebtedness</b> further has an impact upon the workplace, can lead to de-motivation, absenteeism and even a propensity to commit theft.|$|E
50|$|At the {{household}} level, debts {{can also have}} detrimental effects — particularly when households make spending decisions assuming income will increase, or remain stable, in years to come. When households take on credit based on this assumption, life events can easily change indebtedness into <b>over-indebtedness.</b> Such life events include unexpected unemployment, relationship break-up, leaving the parental home, business failure, illness, or home repairs. <b>Over-indebtedness</b> has severe social consequences, such as financial hardship, poor physical and mental health, family stress, stigma, difficulty obtaining employment, exclusion from basic financial services (European Commission, 2009), work accidents and industrial disease, a strain on social relations (Carpentier and Van den Bosch, 2008), absenteeism at work and lack of organisational commitment (Kim et al., 2003), feeling of insecurity, and relational tensions.|$|E

50|$|Causes of <b>over-indebtedness</b> can be diverse. A 'risky life event' (for example, unemployment, {{relationship}} break-up, {{leaving the}} parental home, business failure, illness or unexpected home repairs. Such events can trigger {{income and expenditure}} shocks) can lie at the root, sometimes instantly turning indebtedness into <b>over-indebtedness.</b> Other households have unconsciously, or consciously, gradually becomeover-committed. They make use of available forms of credit, sometimes without realizing {{that they might not}} be able to repay in the future. Lack of financial management skills and aggressive marketing by lenders may both lie at the origin of this. Another potential cause includes escalating consumption habits. The third group of people are the least well-off. They need to obtain credit in order to attain a reasonable standard of living. They are frequently subject to relatively high interest rates. Potential consequences for the over-indebted household include financial hardship, depression, poor health, relationship breakdown, exclusion from basic financial services, a strain on social relations, absenteeism at work and lack of organizational commitment, a feeling of insecurity.|$|E
50|$|Levels of {{indebtedness}} {{are high}} and appear to be increasing. The problem of <b>over-indebtedness</b> is made worse by high levels of consumption finance and consumer ignorance and illiteracy. (32 per cent {{of the adult population}} of South Africa were functionally illiterate in 2001.) By allowing the micro-lending industry to function without legislated and enforced interest-rate limits since 1992, the Government effectively made possible the exploitation of the ignorance of lower-income communities, which arguably amounted to legislated economic abuse.|$|E
5000|$|The {{roots of}} the modern view of {{acceleration}} go back to Fisher (1933). In his seminal work on debt and deflation, which tries to explain the underpinnings of the Great Depression, he studies a mechanism of a downward spiral in the economy induced by <b>over-indebtedness</b> and reinforced by a cycle of debt liquidation, assets and goods’ price deflation, net worth deterioration and economic contraction. His theory was disregarded in favor of Keynesian economics at that time.|$|E
50|$|A credit {{bureau is}} an entity that is engaged for payment in the {{business}} of receiving reports or investigating credit applications and agreements, payment history or patterns, and other consumer credit information.

As indicated above, credit bureaux were required to register with the NCR by July 28, 2006.

These provisions are therefore likely to reduce <b>over-indebtedness</b> and reckless credit granting, at least in the formal sector. A negative result for consumers, however, could be that credit grantors will be much more reluctant to grant credit in the future, and that, therefore, fewer people will be able to access credit. Further, this could lead to an increase in the number of unregistered and illegal credit providers.|$|E
50|$|Karnani (2007) {{also argued}} that as the poor often make choices {{that are not in}} their own self-interest like the use of {{whitening}} cream in developing countries, consumer-led models that develop new product options may be inappropriate with much of the current discussion around consumer protection and <b>over-indebtedness</b> in microfinance Karnanis paper also criticises the focus on MNCs in exploiting opportunities {{at the bottom of the}} pyramid given the greater development impact that SMEs could potentially have and he argues that inclusive business models frameworks should see the poor primarily as producers rather than as consumers.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{consumers}} are often to blame for allowing themselves to become over-indebted by unwisely borrowing too much money, or by buying too much on credit. This is usually the result of economic desperation and lack of understanding of the difficulties of repaying or servicing their debt. Credit providers are, however, often to blame for recklessly giving too much credit to consumers who cannot afford to service their debt. One of the most important objectives of the Act is to combat <b>over-indebtedness</b> and reckless credit granting. Sections 78 to 88 of the Act contain detailed, far-reaching and extremely important provisions in this regard.|$|E
50|$|The West and East Prussian Estates, {{separately}} (the latter gathering after 1772 {{representatives of}} newly formed East Prussia, comprising the former Duchy of Prussia and {{the parts of}} former Royal Prussia west of the Vistula), again {{played a role in}} the transformation from feudal traditional agriculture to agricultural business. The Silesian Wars of 1740-1763 had required high taxes, such that many Prussian tax-payers went into debt. Feudal manor estates were not free property sellable at the will of their holders or - in case of <b>over-indebtedness</b> - by way of execution prompted by the creditors of the holders. So the holders of feudal manor estates found it difficult to borrow against their estates. Therefore, in 1787 the West Prussian estates, and a year later the East Prussian estates, each took on the task of forming credit corporations: the Westpreussische Landschaft and the Ostpreussische Landschaft, respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Responses to {{household}} <b>over-indebtedness</b> can be preventive, alleviative and rehabilitative. Preventive measures include {{financial education}} and regulation. An {{example of the}} last is the European Union’s [...] "Directive on Credit Agreements for Consumers Household debt advisory services". It stipulates, for example, that lenders should list the interest rates they change in a homogenized way (yearly rates) and that paper contracts should be signed for debts above a certain amounts, thus inhibiting for example impulsive borrowing through SMS-loans. Alleviative measures include debt advisory services, which aim to help households getting their finances back on track, mainly by means of information provision, budget planning and balancing, help with legal arrangements, negotiation with creditors, providing psychological support by having someone to talk to, and even by effectively, voluntarily taking over the managing of a household's finances. Rehabilitative measures include consumer bankruptcy and legal debt settlement procedures. While precise arrangements vary largely between countries, in general such procedures work as follows. During such procedures, the over-indebted household hands over all income above a minimum threshold to the creditors/state and is cleared of its debts after the period, varying in length from for example 1 year in the UK to 5 in Portugal and 12 in Ireland.|$|E
5000|$|In Fisher's {{formulation}} of debt deflation, when the debt bubble bursts the following {{sequence of events}} occurs: Assuming, accordingly, that, {{at some point in}} time, a state of <b>over-indebtedness</b> exists, this will tend to lead to liquidation, through the alarm either of debtors or creditors or both. Then we may deduce the following chain of consequences in nine links:# Debt liquidation leads to distress selling and to# Contraction of deposit currency, as bank loans are paid off, and to a slowing down of velocity of circulation. This contraction of deposits and of their velocity, precipitated by distress selling, causes# A fall in the level of prices, in other words, a swelling of the dollar. Assuming, as above stated, that this fall of prices is not interfered with by reflation or otherwise, there must be# A still greater fall in the net worths of business, precipitating bankruptcies and# A like fall in profits, which in a [...] "capitalistic," [...] that is, a private-profit society, leads the concerns which are running at a loss to make# A reduction in output, in trade and in employment of labor. These losses, bankruptcies and unemployment, lead to# pessimism and loss of confidence, which in turn lead to# Hoarding and slowing down still more the velocity of circulation.#:The above eight changes cause# Complicated disturbances in the rates of interest, in particular, a fall in the nominal, or money, rates and a rise in the real, or commodity, rates of interest.|$|E
50|$|The rate {{of people}} who have {{problems}} of shopping addiction is a very controversial matter, because the dividing line between pathological behaviours and those behaviours which, even if excessive, are socially accepted, is very difficult to determine. However, shopping addiction and other manifestations of the lack of self-control on spending are widespread problems which are constantly expanding. Studies using samples of the general population show that between 8% and 16% of the people have problems with excessive or uncontrolled purchases. Clinical studies give much lower figures, however, between 2% and 5%. According to the European Report on the programme for the prevention and treatment of personal problems related to consumer addiction, personal purchasing habits and <b>over-indebtedness,</b> 3% of European adults and 8% of European young people have a level of shopping addiction which could be considered as pathologic, that is, which seriously affects the life of the people who suffer from this. Other estimates for the prevalence of compulsive buying range from a low of 2 percent to 12 percent or more (in the U.S. population.).Most {{of people who}} have these problems neither receive nor ask for treatment. Those that ask for help only do it after years of suffering, when the addiction has caused very serious economic repercussion and has harmed the relationship with their family and social environment. For this reason and {{due to the lack of}} social consciousness about this problem, the unrecorded figure of people who suffer from these problems is very high. In addition to the severe cases of shopping addiction, an important part of consumers (between 30% and 50% of the population) have deficiencies with spending self-control or excessive purchases. According to the European Report, 33% of European adults and 46% of the European young people have minor or moderate problems with shopping addiction or lack of economic self-control.|$|E
40|$|With <b>over-indebtedness</b> {{emerging}} among microfinance customers, the industry's sustainability {{and social}} impact are at risk. Filling a void in the literature, this paper develops {{a definition of}} <b>over-indebtedness</b> that is appropriate for customer protection purposes. It provides a framework for the causes of <b>over-indebtedness</b> that highlights the role of external influences and the responsibility of lenders. It recognises the role borrowers play in their own <b>over-indebtedness.</b> This paper challenges several misconceptions and oversimplifications about microfinance <b>over-indebtedness.</b> These include the belief that default-based risk management indicators are sufficient to signal concerns in relation to customer protection. Further misconceptions are the undesirability of consumption loans, {{as well as the}} benefits of competition, of regular instalment schedules, of a zero-tolerance policy and of annual percentage rates. By enhancing our understanding of microfinance <b>over-indebtedness</b> and its causes, this paper provides the means for measuring <b>over-indebtedness</b> and tailoring solutions to its root causes. The analysis shows that combating <b>over-indebtedness</b> does not automatically mean reducing access to microcredit.

40|$|In the past, the {{microfinance}} industry focused {{mainly on}} growth and outreach. Addressing financial exclusion implied a huge supply gap. Recent <b>over-indebtedness</b> crises {{in several countries}} have shown that this gap can turn into over-supply. The industry urgently requires research to understand the magnitude and consequences of this shift. This chapter reveals the broad spectrum of consequences <b>over-indebtedness</b> can have on borrowers and other stakeholders, mainly MFIs. It emphasizes that <b>over-indebtedness</b> consequences reach far beyond the risk management concerns that MFIs and investors have {{on top of their}} mind. In a second step the chapter reviews the existing empirical research on microfinance <b>over-indebtedness</b> and examines how prevalent <b>over-indebtedness</b> is in microfinance markets today.

40|$|Microfinance, the {{provision}} of financial services to the poor, has been celebrated for its win-win proposition of reducing poverty while operating on a financially sustainable or even profitable basis. However, the industry has recently experienced several crises that have challenged both its financial sustainability and its social reputation. As a result, {{the focus of the}} microfinance sector on commercialization has given way to a new emphasis on client-focused products and services and on customer protection as the industry’s current priorities. Given the risks it implies both to the social impact of microfinance and to institutional sustainability, the main focus of the current client protection efforts in microfinance is on protecting borrowers against <b>over-indebtedness.</b> However, customer protection efforts are struggling with a significant gap of knowledge about the prevalence, causes and consequences of <b>over-indebtedness.</b> There is no agreed definition or measurement of personal <b>over-indebtedness.</b> Especially, there is no appropriate definition for customer protection purposes and for the specific circumstances of microfinance. Existing <b>over-indebtedness</b> definitions mostly centre on default, thus avoiding portfolio quality problems for the lending institutions. They do not take into account that borrowers already experience severe consequences of <b>over-indebtedness</b> before reaching the stage of default. Findings on the empirical prevalence of <b>over-indebtedness</b> and on its causes and consequences may differ based on a definition that takes the borrowers’ <b>over-indebtedness</b> experiences and thus the customer protection perspective into account. The first paper of this PhD develops an <b>over-indebtedness</b> definition that is suitable for customer protection purposes in the microfinance context. The definition is based on the sacrifices that microborrowers experience related to their loans. Working with the economics, psychology, and sociology literatures on both microfinance and consumer finance, the paper provides a conceptual analysis of the demand and supply side factors that cause <b>over-indebtedness</b> as well as the role of adverse economic shocks. The second paper reveals the broad spectrum of consequences that <b>over-indebtedness</b> can have on borrowers and on MFIs. It then reviews the empirical studies on <b>over-indebtedness</b> in the microfinance industry to date to shed light on the prevalence of <b>over-indebtedness</b> in microfinance. In an empirical field research supported by the Independent Evaluation Department of KfW Entwicklungsbank and the Smart Campaign at ACCION’s Center for Financial Inclusion, the PhD applies the customer protection definition of <b>over-indebtedness</b> that results from the first paper to the microfinance market of Accra in Ghana. The third paper uses this unique database to pinpoint the prevalence of <b>over-indebtedness</b> in this market and analyse the debt experiences of microborrowers. In a second step, by means of a logistic regression of alternative measurements on the customer protection measurement of <b>over-indebtedness,</b> it provides empirical confirmation for the important differences between the risk management perspective on <b>over-indebtedness</b> and the customer protection point of view. Finally, the fourth paper of the PhD tests socio-demographic and economic factors on the borrower level for their relationship to <b>over-indebtedness.</b> It sheds light on how the potential <b>over-indebtedness</b> causes that emerge from the analysis of paper 1 relate to the likelihood of a borrower being over-indebted. It also works with the primary database from Ghana and uses econometric regression methods to confirm to what extent theses potential causes of <b>over-indebtedness</b> relate to <b>over-indebtedness</b> in the given microfinance setting.

It finds that poorer microborrowers {{are more likely to}} be over-indebted. The risk of <b>over-indebtedness</b> further increases with the occurrence of adverse economic shocks to a borrower’s income or expenses. The likelihood of <b>over-indebtedness</b> is higher for borrowers with low returns on their investment and if borrowers use loans, at least in part, for non-productive purposes. It is higher for borrowers with a low, debt-specific financial literacy. General financial literacy has negative effects on <b>over-indebtedness.</b> We find no effect for mere numeracy.

40|$|In {{the context}} of the present crisis of microfinance, it is quite common to use the term <b>over-indebtedness</b> among the poor. Coming up with a precise {{definition}} of <b>over-indebtedness</b> for research or regulatory purposes is surprisingly a complex challenge. Few of researchers took attempt to define and measure <b>over-indebtedness</b> among microfinance borrowers. Among them Maurer and Pytkowska (2010); Spannuth & Pytkowska (2011) and Schicks (2011) are notable. But their definition and measurement process of <b>over-indebtedness</b> are not unique. Maurer and Pytkowska showed that by taking microcredit, 17 % borrowers are over-indebted and 11 % borrowers are at risk of becoming over-indebted in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Spannuth & Pytkowska demonstrated that 7 % borrowers are insolvent, 4 % borrowers are in critical position and 14 % are at risk of becoming over-indebted in Kosovo.
