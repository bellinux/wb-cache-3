25|$|Many type {{systems have}} been created that are {{specialized}} for use in certain environments with certain types of data, or for <b>out-of-band</b> static program analysis. Frequently, these are based on ideas from formal type theory and are only available as part of prototype research systems.|$|E
25|$|A {{specific}} {{example of}} a nuke attack that gained some prominence is the WinNuke, which exploited the vulnerability in the NetBIOS handler in Windows 95. A string of <b>out-of-band</b> data was sent to TCP port 139 of the victim's machine, causing it to lock up and display a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD).|$|E
25|$|The {{linearity}} {{requirement is}} demanding, especially for transmitter RF output circuitry where amplifiers are often {{designed to be}} non-linear in order to minimise power consumption. In practical OFDM systems {{a small amount of}} peak clipping is allowed to limit the PAPR in a judicious trade-off against the above consequences. However, the transmitter output filter which is required to reduce <b>out-of-band</b> spurs to legal levels has the effect of restoring peak levels that were clipped, so clipping is not an effective way to reduce PAPR.|$|E
25|$|Intel has {{developed}} a successor to its Low Pin Count (LPC) bus that it calls the Enhanced Serial Peripheral Interface Bus, or eSPI for short. Intel aims to allow {{the reduction in the}} number of pins required on motherboards compared to systems using LPC, have more available throughput than LPC, reduce the working voltage to 1.8 volts to facilitate smaller chip manufacturing processes, allow eSPI peripherals to share SPI flash devices with the host (the LPC bus did not allow firmware hubs to be used by LPC peripherals), tunnel previous <b>out-of-band</b> pins through the eSPI bus, and allow system designers to trade off cost and performance.|$|E
500|$|A common {{application}} of waffle-iron filters {{is to remove}} the harmonics of transmitters, such as high power radar, before applying to the antenna. [...] Legislation in most jurisdictions requires strict limits on <b>out-of-band</b> transmissions since these can cause serious interference with other stations. [...] This is an application that usually requires a very wide stopband, a characteristic of waffle-iron filters. [...] For instance, to remove all harmonics up to the fifth {{it is necessary for}} a low-pass filter to have a stopband greater than three times the passband.Levy, p.526Mendenhall, pp.805–806 ...|$|E
500|$|The {{wide-band}} {{nature of}} waffle-iron filters finds applications in satellite communications. [...] A satellite earth station may have multiple diplexers {{connected to a}} multi-band antenna feeder. [...] Each diplexer delivers a wide-band signal in a different band and {{it is essential that}} its signal does not contain <b>out-of-band</b> components, particularly harmonics. [...] These can seriously interfere with, or even stop entirely, communication in another band. [...] The diplexer must therefore have a stopband that is even wider than the passband. [...] For this reason, {{as well as the other}} advantages of waffle-irons, these diplexers are commonly made to a waffle-iron design.Manuilov et al., 2009, p.526 ...|$|E

2500|$|Intel Active Management Technology, part of Intel vPro, {{implements}} <b>out-of-band</b> management, giving administrators remote administration, remote management, {{and remote}} control of PCs with no {{involvement of the}} host processor or BIOS, even when the system is powered off. Remote administration includes remote power-up and power-down, remote reset, redirected boot, console redirection, pre-boot access to BIOS settings, programmable filtering for inbound and outbound network traffic, agent presence checking, <b>out-of-band</b> policy-based alerting, access to system information, such as hardware asset information, persistent event logs, and other information that is stored in dedicated memory (not on the hard drive) where it is accessible even if the OS is down or the PC is powered off. Some of these functions require the deepest level of rootkit, a second non-removable spy computer built around the main computer. Sandy Bridge and future chipsets have [...] "the ability to remotely kill and restore a lost or stolen PC via 3G". Hardware rootkits built into the chipset can help recover stolen computers, remove data, or render them useless, but they also present privacy and security concerns of undetectable spying and redirection by management or hackers who might gain control.|$|E
2500|$|Used in multi-driver speaker systems, the {{crossover}} is {{an assembly}} of filters that separate the input signal into different frequency ranges (i.e. [...] "bands"), {{according to the}} requirements of each driver. Hence the drivers receive power only at their operating frequency (the sound frequency range they were designed for), thereby reducing distortion in the drivers and interference between them. The ideal characteristics of a crossover may include perfect <b>out-of-band</b> attenuation at the output of each filter, no amplitude variation ("ripple") within each passband, no phase delay between overlapping frequency bands, to name just a few.|$|E
2500|$|Later {{revisions}} of the PCI specification add support for message-signaled interrupts. In this system, a device signals its need for service by performing a memory write, rather than by asserting a dedicated line. [...] This alleviates the problem of scarcity of interrupt lines. [...] Even if interrupt vectors are still shared, it does not suffer the sharing problems of level-triggered interrupts. [...] It also resolves the routing problem, because the memory write is not unpredictably modified between device and host. [...] Finally, because the message signaling is in-band, it resolves some synchronization problems that can occur with posted writes and <b>out-of-band</b> interrupt lines.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{variant of}} Conficker, {{discovered}} in early November 2008, propagated through the Internet by exploiting a vulnerability {{in a network}} service (MS08-067) on Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 Beta. While Windows 7 may {{have been affected by}} this vulnerability, the Windows 7 Beta was not publicly available until January 2009. [...] Although Microsoft released an emergency <b>out-of-band</b> patch on October 23, 2008 to close the vulnerability, a large number of Windows PCs (estimated at 30%) remained unpatched as late as January 2009. [...] A second variant of the virus, discovered in December 2008, added the ability to propagate over LANs through removable media and network shares. [...] Researchers believe that these were decisive factors in allowing the virus to propagate quickly.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Out-of-band</b> {{control is}} a {{characteristic}} of network protocols with which data control is regulated. <b>Out-of-band</b> control passes control data on a separate connection from main data. Protocols such as FTP use <b>out-of-band</b> control.|$|E

5000|$|Some sources define [...] "out-of-band data" [...] as {{including}} the characteristic that <b>out-of-band</b> data should be prioritized ahead of queued in-band data. [...] This {{is reinforced by}} TCP's (RFC 793) referring to the <b>out-of-band</b> data mechanism as [...] "urgent data". However, prioritization is neither an essential nor a necessarily desirable characteristic of <b>out-of-band</b> data; moreover, TCP implementations vary greatly on how they treat the urgency of <b>out-of-band</b> data.|$|E
50|$|Whereas common-channel {{signaling}} {{systems are}} <b>out-of-band</b> by definition, and in-band signaling systems are also necessarily channel-associated, the above metering pulse example demonstrates that there exist channel-associated signaling systems which are <b>out-of-band.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The most {{commonly}} used protocol containing an <b>out-of-band</b> data mechanism is the Internet's Transmission Control Protocol. It implements <b>out-of-band</b> data using an [...] "urgent pointer", which marks certain data in the transmitted data stream as <b>out-of-band.</b> Unfortunately, a long-existing discrepancy between RFC 793 and RFC 1122 limits the usability of this feature of TCP; nonetheless, it is heavily used by certain standard application protocols, notably the Telnet protocol.|$|E
5000|$|Out of band data is a logically {{independent}} {{transmission channel}} between {{a pair of}} connected stream sockets. In computer networking, <b>out-of-band</b> data is the data transferred through a stream that is independent from the main in-band data stream. An <b>out-of-band</b> data mechanism provides a conceptually independent channel, which allows any data sent via that mechanism to be kept separate from in-band data. The <b>out-of-band</b> data mechanism should be provided as an inherent characteristic of the data channel and transmission protocol, rather than requiring a separate channel and endpoints to be established. [...] The term [...] "out-of-band data" [...] probably derives from <b>out-of-band</b> signaling, as used in the telecommunications industry.|$|E
50|$|This {{article focuses}} mainly on <b>out-of-band</b> {{management}} of servers, but also many (if not most) network devices offer <b>out-of-band</b> management. Modular/blade systems with dedicated management modules often offer a dedicated OOB Ethernet port or Lights out management port.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} to implement <b>out-of-band</b> data transmission using a physically separate channel, but most commonly <b>out-of-band</b> data is a feature provided by a transmission protocol using the same channel as normal data. A typical protocol might divide the {{data to be transmitted}} into blocks, which each block having a header word that identifies the type of data being sent, and a count of the data bytes or words to be sent in the block. The header will identify the data as being in-band or <b>out-of-band,</b> along with other identification and routing information. At the receiving end, the protocol looks at the header and routes the data to the normal reception endpoint if it is in-band, and to a separate mechanism if it is <b>out-of-band.</b> Depending on the implementation, there may be some mechanism for notifying or interrupting the receiving application when <b>out-of-band</b> data has arrived.|$|E
5000|$|Intel Active Management Technology (AMT) is {{hardware}} and firmware technology for remote <b>out-of-band</b> management of personal computers, {{in order to}} monitor, maintain, update, upgrade, and repair them. <b>Out-of-band</b> (OOB) or hardware-based management is different from software-based (or in-band) management and software management agents.|$|E

50|$|Because AMT has an <b>out-of-band</b> {{communication}} channel, AMT {{can present}} the PC's security posture {{to the network}} even if the PC's OS or security software is compromised. Since AMT presents the posture <b>out-of-band,</b> the network can also authenticate the PC <b>out-of-band,</b> before the OS or applications load and before they try to access the network. If the security posture is not correct, a system administrator can push an update OOB (via Intel AMT) or reinstall critical security software before letting the PC access the network.|$|E
50|$|How {{the user}} {{activates}} this feature {{depends on their}} phone system — generally it is either in-band-signaling DTMF sequence such as the *57 Vertical service code or a special button attached to their phone generating an <b>out-of-band</b> signal. For analogue services, many exchanges will interpret DTMF sequences to activate POTS. Digital services, such as ISDN or GSM, enable the CPE to activate MCI via <b>out-of-band</b> signaling. Often with PABXs with analogue phone connections, the PABX will interpret the DTMF and then activate the <b>out-of-band</b> signaling.|$|E
50|$|Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI) are an {{alternative}} in-band method of signaling an interrupt, using special in-band messages to replace traditional <b>out-of-band</b> assertion of dedicated interrupt lines.
