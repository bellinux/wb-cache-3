5|$|Jupiter is {{primarily}} composed of hydrogen with {{a quarter of}} its mass being helium, though helium comprises only about a tenth of the number of molecules. It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an <b>oblate</b> <b>spheroid</b> (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter has at least 69 moons, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.|$|E
25|$|This {{rotation}} induces a {{centrifugal acceleration}} in the reference {{frame of the}} Earth which slightly counteracts the effect of gravity the closer one is to the equator. One effect is that an object weighs slightly less at the equator. Another is that the Earth is slightly deformed into an <b>oblate</b> <b>spheroid.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{the science}} of geodesy {{measured}} Earth more accurately, {{the shape of the}} geoid was first found not to be a perfect sphere but to approximate an <b>oblate</b> <b>spheroid,</b> a specific type of ellipsoid. More recent measurements have measured the geoid to unprecedented accuracy, revealing mass concentrations beneath Earth's surface.|$|E

25|$|In 1746, {{the volcano}} was {{explored}} by French academicians from the French Geodesic Mission. Their {{mission was to}} determine the sphericity of the Earth.

25|$|A sphere {{can also}} be {{constructed}} as the surface formed by rotating a circle about any of its diameters. Since a circle is a special type of ellipse, a sphere is a special type of ellipsoid of revolution. Replacing the circle with an ellipse rotated about its major axis, the shape becomes a prolate spheroid; rotated about the minor axis, an <b>oblate</b> <b>spheroid.</b>|$|E
25|$|This star is {{rotating}} {{at about}} 92% of its critical speed, completing 1.12 rotations every day. This {{is giving the}} star an <b>oblate</b> <b>spheroid</b> shape with an equatorial bulge that is 24% larger than the polar radius. This shape is causing the polar region {{to have a higher}} temperature than the equator: the temperature difference is about 1,000K. The axis of rotation is inclined about 20° to the line of sight from the Earth.|$|E

25|$|<b>Oblate</b> <b>spheroid</b> {{waveguide}} (OSWG) horn designs improve directivity pattern control, {{provide a}} lower frequency of directivity (the lower {{the better to}} match woofers and mid-woofers' directivity), and--as claimed by the inventor -- Dr.Earl Geddes they mitigate higher order modes (HOM), a form of linear phase/amplitude-distortion. A major contribution to said comb-filter effects, namely the practically limited hornlength is explicitly not addressed by the theory of OSWG. Realized specimen attempt constant directivity and a smooth transition between the compression driver and the horn. OSWG designs are applied to the higher frequency range, above about 1kHz.|$|E
25|$|The Earth is not {{a perfect}} sphere but an <b>oblate</b> <b>spheroid,</b> with an {{equatorial}} diameter about 43 kilometers larger than its polar diameter. Because of the Earth's axial tilt, {{during most of the}} year the half of this bulge that is closest to the Sun is off-center, either to the north or to the south, and the far half is off-center on the opposite side. The gravitational pull on the closer half is stronger, since gravity decreases with distance, so this creates a small torque on the Earth as the Sun pulls harder {{on one side of the}} Earth than the other. The axis of this torque is roughly perpendicular to the axis of the Earth's rotation so the axis of rotation precesses. If the Earth were a perfect sphere, there would be no precession.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of this variability {{is believed to}} occur due {{to changes in the}} viewing geometry. Uranus is an <b>oblate</b> <b>spheroid,</b> which causes its visible area to become larger when viewed from the poles. This explains in part its brighter appearance at solstices. Uranus is also known to exhibit strong meridional variations in albedo (see above). For instance, the south polar region of Uranus is much brighter than the equatorial bands. In addition, both poles demonstrate elevated brightness in the microwave part of the spectrum, whereas the polar stratosphere is known to be cooler than the equatorial one. So seasonal change seems to happen as follows: poles, which are bright both in visible and microwave spectral bands, come into the view at solstices resulting in brighter planet, whereas the dark equator is visible mainly near equinoxes resulting in darker planet. In addition, occultations at solstices probe hotter equatorial stratosphere.|$|E

The spectra exhibit a distinct absorption peak {{due to the}} localized plasma resonance of the conduction electrons in the particles. The theoretical modeling used rigorous solutions, in the long-wavelength limit, for the polarizability of <b>oblate</b> <b>spheroids</b> and truncated spheres on a substrate. The dipole-dipole interactions between the particles in the square lattice were taken into account. We find good agreement between experimental and theoretical absorption peak positions for the case of <b>oblate</b> <b>spheroids,</b> but not for truncated spheres.

40|$|A {{study of}} the light {{scattering}} properties of randomly oriented, identical spheroidal particles is presented. A computation method was developed to integrate the Asano and Yamomoto solution (1975) for scattering from a homogeneous spheroid over all particle orientations; the extinction and scattering cross-sections, the asymmetry factor, and scattering matrix elements are calculated for randomly oriented prolate and <b>oblate</b> <b>spheroids</b> and compared with the calculations for spheres and laboratory measurements.

25|$|This work {{culminated in}} the work of Isaac Newton. Newton's Principia {{formulated}} the laws of motion and universal gravitation, which dominated scientists' view of the physical universe for the next three centuries. By deriving Kepler's laws of planetary motion from his mathematical description of gravity, and then using the same principles to account for the trajectories of comets, the tides, the precession of the equinoxes, and other phenomena, Newton removed the last doubts about the validity of the heliocentric model of the cosmos. This work also demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies could be described by the same principles. His prediction that the Earth should be shaped as an <b>oblate</b> <b>spheroid</b> was later vindicated by other scientists. His laws of motion were to be the solid foundation of mechanics; his law of universal gravitation combined terrestrial and celestial mechanics into one great system that seemed to be able to describe the whole world in mathematical formulae.|$|E
500|$|Jupiter's {{rotation}} is {{the fastest}} of all the Solar System's planets, completing a rotation on its axis in slightly less than ten hours; this creates an equatorial bulge easily seen through an Earth-based amateur telescope.

40|$|International audienceWe derive an {{effective}} {{equation of motion}} for the orientational dynamics of a neutrally buoyant spheroid suspended in a simple shear flow, valid for arbitrary particle aspect ratios and to linear order in the shear Reynolds number. We show how inertial effects lift the degeneracy of the Jeffery orbits and determine the stabilities of the log-rolling and tumbling orbits at infinitesimal shear Reynolds numbers. For prolate spheroids, we find stable tumbling in the shear plane and log-rolling is unstable. For <b>oblate</b> <b>spheroids,</b> by contrast, log-rolling is stable and tumbling is unstable provided that the particle is not too disk-like (moderate asphericity). For very flat <b>oblate</b> <b>spheroids,</b> both log-rolling and tumbling are stable, separated by an unstable limit cycle. (C) 2015 Author(s).
