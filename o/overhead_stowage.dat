40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is to {{describe}} a crash simulation of a 30 -ft/s vertical drop test of a Boeing 737 (B 737) fuselage section. The drop test of the 10 -ft. long fuselage section of a B 737 aircraft was conducted in November of 2000 at the FAA Technical Center in Atlantic City, NJ. The fuselage section was outfitted with two different commercial <b>overhead</b> <b>stowage</b> bins. In addition, 3, 229 - 1 bs. of luggage were packed in the cargo hold to represent a maximum take-off weight condition. The main objective of the test was to evaluate the response and failure modes of the <b>overhead</b> <b>stowage</b> bins in a narrow-body transport fuselage section when subjected to a severe, but survivable, impact. A secondary objective of the test was to generate experimental data for correlation with the crash simulation. A full-scale 3 -dimensional finite element model of the fuselage section was developed and a crash simulation was conducted using the explicit, nonlinear transient dynamic code, MSC. Dytran. Pre-test predictions of the fuselage and overhead bin responses were generated for correlation with the drop test data. A description of the finite element model and an assessment of the analytical/experimental correlation are presented. In addition, suggestions for modifications to the model to improve correlation are proposed...|$|E
40|$|To {{fulfill the}} need for shorter {{development}} cycles in modern product development {{the increased use of}} computer-aided engineering is one possibility. While the numerical calculation of a model leads to one single solution, the behavior of systems in the real world is never exactly repeatable due to tolerances and natural scatter in the system parameters. The assessment of the resulting uncertainties is of great importance for systems requiring a high level of reliability (such as aerospace systems), therefore they should be treated with special care in the development process and in particular in computer-aided engineering. This paper describes the execution and analysis of an uncertainty management technique with Stochastic Simulation for an LS-DYNA model of an exemplary system consisting of an <b>overhead</b> <b>stowage</b> bin and carry-on baggage excited by external acceleration. The Stochastic Simulation results are evaluated using statistical methods. It is shown which parameters are of paramount influence on system behavior and may hence result in a critical load due to carry-on baggage. KEYWORDS...|$|E
40|$|The FAA {{restraint}} system experiments consisted of 24 standard and modified seats, 2 standard galleys and 2 standard overhead compartments. Under the controlled impact demonstration (CID) program, the experimental {{objective was to}} demonstrate the effectiveness of individual {{restraint system}} designs when exposed to a survivable air-to-ground impact condition. What researchers were looking for was the performance exhibited by standard and modified designs, performance differences resulting from their installed cabin location, and interrelating performance demonstrated by test article and attaching floor and/or fuselage structure. The other restraint system experiment consisted of 2 standard <b>overhead</b> <b>stowage</b> compartments and 2 galley modules. Again, researchers were concerned with the retention of stowed equipment and carry-on articles. The overhead compartments were loaded with test weights up to their maximum capacity, {{and each of the}} galleys was filled with test articles: aft with normal galley equipment, forward with hazardous material test packages. A breakdown of instrumentation and distribution is given beginning with 11 instrumented type anthropomorphic dummies and 185 sensors which provided for acceleration and load measurements at the various experiment and associated structure locations. The onboard cameras provided additional coverage of these experiments, including the areas of cabin which were not instrumented. Test results showing the window-side leg forces versus pulse duration are given...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a steady-state or transient, three-dimensional mathematical field model describing aircraft cabin fires. The fire is modelled {{by a simple}} heat source, and the simulation is intended to represent non-spreading fires. The computer code implementing the model uses a body-fitted coordinate (BFC) formulation to describe accurately {{the interior of the}} aircraft, that is neither Cartesian nor polar-cylindrical. The model is first used to predict the experimental results obtained from a series of fire tests performed in a Boeing- 737 fuselage (without fittings). Both steady-state and transient results are presented and discussed. Then the effect of openings in the fuselage and cabin compartmentation on the temperature distribution within the empty aircraft cabin is investigated. With the forward and aft bulkhead doors open, allowing for natural convection, the temperatures are kept to tolerate levels. When the forward door is closed while the aft is kept open, temperatures increase throughout the cabin even in the aft section. With both forward and aft doors open, the cabin is partitioned into two communicating sections, the forward section containing the fire. When compared to the non-compartmented case temperatures in the aft section decrease while temperatures in the forward section increase. With the cabin fitted with seats, ceiling panels and <b>overhead</b> <b>stowage</b> bins the effect of the aircraft's air-conditioning system on the temperature distribution within the burning fuselage is examined. The results suggest that a reverse flow situation (i. e. cold air injected through floor vents and hot air sucked out at ceiling vents) greatly reduces the temperature throughout the fuselage. It is concluded that, although insufficiently validated as yet {{due to the lack of}} extensive and suitable experimental data, the model is promising...|$|E
