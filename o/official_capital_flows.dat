We examine this question using detailed data on sovereign bond issuances and public syndicated bank loans since 1982. We find that traditional measures of a country’s links {{with the rest of}} the world (such as trade openness) and traditional liquidity and macroeconomic indicators do not help much in explaining market access. However, a country’s vulnerability to shocks and the perceived quality of its policies and institutions appear to be important determinants of its government’s ability to tap the markets.

40|$|Conventional wisdom {{suggests}} that financial liberalization can help countries insure against idiosyncratic risk. There is little evidence, however, that countries have increased risk sharing despite recent widespread financial liberalization. This work {{shows that the}} key to understanding this puzzling observation is that conventional wisdom assumes frictionless international financial markets, while actual international financial markets are far from frictionless. In particular, financial contracts are incomplete and enforceability of debt repayment is limited. Default risk of debt contracts constrains borrowing, and more importantly, it makes borrowing more difficult in bad times, precisely when countries need insurance the most. Thus, default risk of debt contracts hinders international risk sharing. When countries remove their <b>official</b> <b>capital</b> controls, default risk is still present as an implicit barrier to capital flows; the observed increase in <b>capital</b> <b>flows</b> under financial liberalization is in fact too limited to improve risk sharing. If default risk of debt contracts were eliminated, <b>capital</b> <b>flows</b> would be six times greater, and international risk sharing would increase substantially. international risk sharing, financial integration, financial liberalization, financial frictions, sovereign default, international <b>capital</b> <b>flows...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} capital inflows and exchange rate flexibility on the real exchange rate in developing countries based on panel cointegration techniques. The results show that public and private flows {{are associated with a}} real exchange rate appreciation. Among private flows, portfolio investment has the highest appreciation effect-almost seven times that of foreign direct investment or bank loans-and private transfers have the lowest effect. Using a de facto measure of exchange rate flexibility, we find that a more flexible exchange rate helps to dampen appreciation of the real exchange rate stemming from capital inflows.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{document}} is to analyze the main factors that determine Central Bank foreign reserve accumulation in Costa Rica and to estimate an econometric specification to forecast the foreign reserve stock in a two-year span. The foreign reserves stock represents an important variable for the Central Bank of Costa Rica because it allows it to defend the present exchange rate regime of crawling-peg. Our results indicate that the interest rate premium, the real interest rate and the real exchange rate are important factors in the determination of the accumulations of foreign reserves. In addition, <b>official</b> <b>capital</b> <b>flows</b> {{have a positive effect on}} foreign reserve accumulation, while excess real money supply has a negative effect.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide an {{empirical}} analysis of some of the impacts of international financial integration on economic activity and macro-economic volatility in African countries. It is acknowledged that financial integration affect several aspects of economic performance, particularly increases investment rates, technology transfers, trade openness, stimulates the development of domestic financial system and economic growth. Similarly, financial integration is recognized as a potential source of macroeconomic instability. The results of empirical analysis show that the impact of external capital flows on growth seems to depend mainly on the initial conditions and policies implemented to stabilize foreign investment, increase domestic investment, productivity and trade, develop the domestic financial system, expand trade openness and other actions aimed at stimulating growth and reducing poverty. The analysis also shows that financial instability was particularly severe as from the nineties. The instability was more pronounced in the case of portfolio investments than in foreign direct investments because of the longer-term relationship established by the latter. Similarly, trends in <b>official</b> <b>capital</b> <b>flows</b> were less unstable than in private capital flows. Lastly, the volatility of capital flows observed in financially “open” and “closed” countries was accompanied by moderate macroeconomic instability. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper empirically {{documents}} the important differences between persistent episodes of current account surplus and current account deficits {{in the last}} four decades. Motivated by a reversal of global imbalances in the last decades, results derived from this study show how persistent surplus episodes, associated to emerging markets in Asia and net exporters of natural resources, are driven by <b>official</b> <b>capital</b> <b>flows,</b> leave countries internationally more exposed and are less persistent than deficit episodes in developing economies. Positive imbalances seem to be prolonged by high investment or low domestic saving, slow output growth, improvements in the terms of trade and wide spreads between domestic and world interest rates. In contrast, high levels of international reserves and inflation increase the probability of a reversal. Opposite to the aftermath of persistent deficits, reversals from surplus episodes trigger massive inflows of private capital, significantly increasing output growth but surprisingly leaving the real effective exchange rate mainly unaltered. The paper is divided into three main sections. First, I analyze the economic performance of countries while running persistent imbalances. Second, I use a logit model to study the determinants of reversals at the end of these episodes. Finally, I examine the economic consequences of these reversals.

This view (Bernanke 2005) emphasizes, for example, that international <b>capital</b> <b>flows</b> are the results of savings gluts {{in countries such as}} Germany and China, being recycled in claims in countries such as Spain and the United States. Under this approach, international <b>capital</b> <b>flows</b> searching for yield were the main source of speculative dynamics in the countries recipient of these <b>capital</b> <b>flows,</b> and, hence, banking crises are connected to the foreign sector developments. Indeed Borio and Disyatat (2011) note that the since the late 1990 s there has been a remarkable growth in gross international flows (the sum of inflows and outflows), larger than the corresponding current account positions (net <b>capital</b> <b>flows).</b> Importantly, this growth is driven to a large extent by an intensification of <b>capital</b> <b>flows</b> among developed nations. All these observations suggest that it is perhaps more useful to focus on international <b>capital</b> <b>flows,</b> rather than on traditional drivers of current account dynamics.|$|R
