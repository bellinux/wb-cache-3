After the incident, the explorers decided to form their own factions, Doctor <b>Overbuild</b> creating the Assembly, Duke Exeter forming the Sentinels, Hael Storm leading the Venture League, and the Baron's protégé Vanda Darkflame creating the Paradox. The factions worked together to create the Nexus Force in order to destroy the Maelstrom and its minions. The Venture Explorer, a ship carrying new recruits is being attacked by the Maelstrom.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA sea, swell and surf program is improved, tested and evaluated on a micro-computer (HP- 9845 B). Sea swell is calculated by a two dimensional spectral model. The energy balance equation is tested for different cases of wind velocities and water depths. Satisfactory agreement is observed between the offshore model and expected wave heights for a 15 knot wind, but the model <b>overbuilds</b> wave energy for a 30 knot wind. Wave transformation {{is described by}} a one dimensional random wave model in which the wave heights are described using the Rayleigh distribution. The obtained solution of the random wave field is used to predict the longshore currents. An empirical formula for determining the breaker parameters is developed, based on beach slope and incident wave steepness. The improved model is tested using an undulated bathymetry to validate the model physics. The model outputs of wave height and current are compared with data acquired from a wave tank and natural beaches. The model is found to accurately forecast wave heights, breaker location, breaker type and longshore currents for several sets of conditions. Model limitations are discussed and recommendations for further improvement are made. 387 [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|Service {{relocation}} {{represents a}} promising strategy to provide flexible and resource efficient resiliency from link {{failures in the}} optical cloud environment. However, when a failure affects a node hosting a datacenter (DC), service relocation from the affected DC is not possible. One alternative to protect against DC failures relies on using design strategies that duplicate the IT (i. e., storage and processing) resources in a backup DC {{at the expense of}} increasing resource <b>overbuild</b> (i. e., cost) of the network. This work proposes a dimensioning strategy based on the shared-path shared-computing (SPSC) concept able to protect against any single link, server, or DC failure scenario with minimal resource <b>overbuild</b> for the network and IT infrastructures. SPSC is based on the intuition that only storage units need complete replication in backup DC, while processing units can be instantiated only after the occurrence of a failure, leaving the design strategy some leeway to minimize their number. As result, the proposed SPSC design shows a considerable reduction in the amount of backup resources when compared to the dedicated protection strategies. QC 20170704 </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In MPLS/GMPLS networks, a {{range of}} {{restoration}} schemes {{will be required to}} support different tradeoffs between service interruption time and network resource utilization. In light of these tradeoffs, path-based end-to-end shared mesh restoration provides a very attractive solution. However, efficient use of bandwidth for shared mesh restoration strongly relies on the procedure for selecting restoration paths. In this paper, we propose an efficient restoration path selection algorithm for restorable connections over shared bandwidth in a fully distributed MPLS/GMPLS architecture. We also describe how to extend MPLS/GMPLS signaling protocols to collect the necessary information efficiently. To evaluate the algorithm’s performance, we compare it via simulation with two other well-known algorithms on a typical intercity backbone network. The key figure of merit for restoration bandwidth efficiency is restoration <b>overbuild,</b> i. e., the extra bandwidth required to meet the network restoration objective {{as a percentage of the}} bandwidth of the network with no restoration. Our simulation results show that our algorithm uses significantly less restoration <b>overbuild</b> (63 %– 68 %) compared with the other two algorithms (83 %– 90 %).

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{trends in}} {{bandwidth}} markets show that customers are tending to ask providers {{for a large}} bandwidth but for {{a limited amount of}} time to support new short-term bandwidthhungry applications. In order to meet these new requirements, progress in network technologies (fast and reconfigurable switching equipment) and protocols [such as generalized multiprotocol label switching (GMPLS) and automatically switched optical network (ASON) ] is paving the road towards flexible optical transport networks in which leasable circuits could be set up and released on a short-term basis. As a result, for dynamic traffic, the holding time of connection requests can be known in advance. The authors propose to exploit knowledge of connection holding time to design an efficient algorithm, called PHOTO, for the dynamic provisioning of shared-path-protected connections in optical mesh networks. The core idea of the proposal consists of exploiting the knowledge of the holding time of connection requests to minimize resource <b>overbuild</b> (RO) due to backup capacity and hence achieve resource–usage efficiency. For a typical US nationwide network, savings on RO of up to 10 % were obtained for practical scenarios compared to a holding-time-unaware, but otherwise shared-pathefficient, approach.

This paper uses a simulation model to explore outcomes when alternative policies are applied to improve office market efficiency. A supply queuing circuit breaker about once every decade during the "euphoria " stage of a property cycle might reduce the severity of oversupply incidents and prevent costly market collapses. But policy interventions could also reduce market efficiency if not properly designed and implemented. The model demonstrates that shortening supply lags through use of forecasts, reducing incentives to <b>overbuild,</b> and smoothing supply responses could each reduce cycle amplitude. Whether policy interventions and forecasting would increase allocative efficiency depends upon the specifics of implementation, the distribution of forecast errors, and the rationality of supply behaviour.

The contribution {{presented in this}} paper follows three main characteristics: i) Proposing a new time-aware traffic engineering path constraint considering holding time of connections in addition to the availability, ii) Introducing a novel provisioning algorithm considering the proposed path attribute, and iii) Applying a high volume of high- priority dynamic traffic with long duration to the introduced mechanism in a new simulation environment to prove its effectiveness. The proposed mechanism benefits from dynamic service level agreement negotiation between a customer and service providers to buffer and further process the potentially blocked high priority connection requests.

However, the welfare consequences of bubbles may actually be higher in more elastic places because those places will <b>overbuild</b> more in response to a bubble. The data show that the price run-ups of the 1980 s were almost exclusively experienced in cities where housing supply is more inelastic.

40|$|Electric utility {{restructuring}} {{was initiated}} in the 1990 s {{to remedy the}} problem of relatively high electricity costs in the Northeast and California. While politicians hoped that reform would allow low-cost electricity to flow to highcost states and that competition would reduce prices, economists wanted reform to eliminate regulatory incentives to <b>overbuild</b> generating capacity and spur the introduction of real-time prices for electricity. Unfortunately, high-cost states have seen little price relief, and competition has had a negligible impact on prices. Meanwhile, the California crisis of 2000 - 2001 has led many states to adopt policies that would once again encourage excess capacity. Finally, real-time pricing, although the subject of experiments, has yet to emerge.

We recommend total abandonment of restructuring and a more thoroughgoing embrace of markets than contemplated in current restructuring initiatives.
