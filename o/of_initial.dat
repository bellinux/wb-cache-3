5|$|An {{increasingly}} common strategy to preserve bone and reduce treatment times includes {{the placement of}} a dental implant into a recent extraction site. On the one hand, it shortens treatment time and can improve aesthetics because the soft tissue envelope is preserved.

Conclusions on this topic are difficult to draw, however, because few studies have compared immediate and delayed implants in a scientifically rigorous manner.|$|E

The first part of the thesis is an overview on what is being said about the zhuang-group initials and the zhang-group initials in previous studies. The second part of the thesis discusses the merge and the split <b>of</b> the zhuang-group <b>initials</b> and the zhang-group initials based on their historical development and in conjunction with ancient Chinese and Modern Chinese Phonology. The third part of the thesis uses the data of the distribution <b>of</b> the zhuang-group <b>initials</b> and the zhang-group initials in present day Northern Mandarin to discuss the categories of these two groups <b>of</b> <b>initials</b> in Middle Chinese. Combining the observations made from both dialectal data and historical studies, the conclusion of the present study is that the zhuang-group initials and the zhang-group initials should be considered belonging to two different groups <b>of</b> <b>initials,</b> which will be the fourth part of the thesis...|$|R

Lamb shared his idea with several cable executives, who helped him launch the network. Among them were Bob Rosencrans who provided $25,000 <b>of</b> <b>initial</b> funding in 1979 and John D.

Caregivers can supply important information on the daily living abilities, {{as well as on the}} decrease, over time, of the person's mental function. A caregiver's viewpoint is particularly important, since a person with AD is commonly unaware of his own deficits.

5|$|However, later {{research}} suggests that the initial stability of the implant in bone is a more important determinant of success of implant integration, rather than a certain period of healing time. As a result, the time allowed to heal is typically based on the density of bone the implant is placed in and the number of implants splinted together, rather than a uniform amount of time. When implants can withstand high torque (35 Ncm) and are splinted to other implants, there are no meaningful differences in long-term implant survival or bone loss between implants loaded immediately, at three months, or at six months. The corollary is that single implants, even in solid bone, require a period of no-load to minimize the risk <b>of</b> <b>initial</b> failure.|$|E

5|$|Inaugurated at Ottawa, Canada, in October 1939, EATS {{was a plan}} {{to expand}} the Royal Air Force's (RAF) {{capacity}} to train aircrews by creating a pool of personnel from various Commonwealth countries—Australia, Canada, Britain and New Zealand—through {{the establishment of a}} common training system consisting of a series <b>of</b> <b>initial,</b> elementary, and advanced training schools.

Seventeen RAAF squadrons were formed during the war under Article XV of the agreement.|$|E
5|$|On 13–14 May, the Germans were vulnerable. A strong {{attack at}} this point by the French {{armoured}} units could have prevented Guderian from breaking out of the Meuse bridgeheads and changed {{the outcome of the}} campaign. However, the French commanders, already deeply schooled and versed in the rather staunchly defensively-focused broad, generalized doctrine of methodological warfare, were located far to the rear, which meant they lacked a real-time and up-to-date picture of the battle. When intelligence did filter through, it was out-of-date.
