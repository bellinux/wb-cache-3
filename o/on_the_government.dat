5|$|Although many aborigines assumed Han {{religious}} practices, several sub-groups sought {{protection from}} the European missionaries, who had started arriving in the 1860s. Many of the early Christian converts were displaced groups of Plains Aborigines that sought {{protection from the}} oppressive Han. The missionaries, under the articles of extraterritoriality, offered a form of power against the Qing establishment and could thus make demands <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> to provide redress for the complaints of Plains Aborigines. Many of these early congregations have served to maintain aboriginal identity, language and cultures.|$|E
5|$|Historic {{buildings}} from Basin's heyday form much of {{the core}} of the CDP's small business district, which includes a fire station, a post office, two restaurants, a bar, a commercial gallery, small specialty shops. Basin has a small elementary school, its own water system, and a low-power radio station. Local volunteers and elected trustees provide limited services to the settlement, but it relies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> of Jefferson County, Montana, for law enforcement and other services. From 1993 through 2011 Basin was home to the Montana Artists Refuge.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} {{attempted to}} prohibit {{the use of}} copper currency in border regions and in seaports, but the Song-issued copper coin became common in the Liao, Western Xia, Japanese, and Southeast Asian economies. The Song government would turn to other types of material for its currency in order to ease the demand <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> mint, including the issuing of iron coinage and paper banknotes. In the year 976, the percentage of issued currency using copper coinage was 65%; after 1135, this had dropped significantly to 54%, a government attempt to debase the copper currency.|$|E

5|$|With {{strong support}} from Ryzhkov, Gorbachev {{abolished}} the Central Committee economic department, thereby strengthening the authority of central government over economic matters.

5|$|After the May elections, the Grinius/Sleževičius {{government}} lifted martial law, {{still in}} effect in Kaunas and other localities, restored democratic freedoms, and granted broad amnesty to political prisoners. For the first time, Lithuania had become truly democratic. However, the change {{did not meet}} with universal approval. Many of the released prisoners were communists who quickly used the new freedoms of speech to organize a protest attended by approximately 400 people in Kaunas on 13 June. The protest was dispersed. The new government's opposition used this protest as the platform for a public attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>government,</b> alleging that it was allowing illegal organizations (the Communist Party of Lithuania was still outlawed) to continue their activities freely. Despite its local nature, the incident was presented as {{a major threat to}} Lithuania and its military; the government was said to be incapable of dealing with this threat.|$|E
5|$|At present, Romania {{is divided}} into 41 {{counties}} and one municipality (Bucharest); these are assigned as the NUTS-3 geocode statistical subdivision scheme of Romania within the European Union. Each of the counties is further divided into cities (some of which have municipality status) and communes. The prefect and his administration have executive prerogatives within the county limits, while limited legislative powers are assigned to a County Council elected every four years during local elections. The territorial districts of the Romanian judicial system overlap with county borders, thus avoiding further complication in {{the separation of powers}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the new Congress in 1977, Mathias was in line for several potential committee promotions to ranking member. However, Mathias' outspoken criticism of the party in the previous election cycle aroused enmity amongst his colleagues. On the Judiciary Committee, Mathias had the most seniority of any other member except Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who already held another ranking membership on the Armed Services Committee. Only one ranking membership was allowed per senator, so Thurmond resigned his ranking membership on the Armed Services Committee to circumvent Mathias serving as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. Mathias was also prevented from assuming leadership positions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> Operations Committee following a power struggle, and on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights. On the latter subcommittee, Mathias had more seniority than any other member. However, party leaders were uneasy with the idea of allowing Mathias to team up with liberal Democrat and subcommittee chairman Birch Bayh, and voted instead for William L. Scott as ranking member.|$|E
5|$|Buddhist discontent erupted {{following}} a ban in early May on flying the Buddhist flag in Huế on Vesak, {{the birthday of}} Gautama Buddha. Just days before, Catholics had been encouraged to fly the Vatican flag at a celebration for Archbishop Ngô Đình Thục of Huế, Diệm's elder brother. A large crowd of Buddhists protested the ban, defying the government by flying Buddhist flags on the Buddhist holy day of Vesak and marching <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> broadcasting station. Government forces fired into the crowd of protesters, killing nine people. Diệm's refusal to take responsibility — he blamed the Viet Cong for the deaths — led to further Buddhist protests and calls for religious equality. As Diem remained unwilling to comply with Buddhist demands, the frequency of protests increased.|$|E
5|$|Charles III of Naples {{landed in}} Dalmatia in September 1385. Sigismund of Luxemburg invaded Upper Hungary (now Slovakia), forcing {{the queen mother}} to give Mary in {{marriage}} to him in October. However, they could not prevent Charles from entering Buda. After Mary renounced the throne, Charles was crowned king on 31December 1385, but he was murdered at the instigation of Mary's mother in February 1386. Mary was restored, but the murdered king's supporters captured her and her mother on 25July. Queen Elizabeth was murdered in January 1387, but Mary was released on 4June 1387. Mary officially remained the co-ruler with Sigismund, who had meanwhile been crowned king, but her influence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> was minimal. She and her premature son died after her horse threw her during a hunting trip.|$|E
