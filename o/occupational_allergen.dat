40|$|Abstract: Occupational asthma is characterised by airway inflammation, {{variable}} {{airflow limitation}} and airway hyperresponsiveness related causally to work. The {{aim of the}} study was to ascertain whether in patients with occupational asthma findings persist after withdrawal from <b>occupational</b> <b>allergen</b> exposure. A group of 37 patients with occupational asthma and a control group of 19 persons were examined. Results in asthmatics obtained during the first visit when occupational asthma was acknowledged, were compared with recent results about 6. 5 yr on average after elimination of <b>occupational</b> <b>allergen</b> exposure. Recent findings in occupational asthma patients were compared with the control group. In patients with occupational asthma, no significant differences were found between results obtained at the first and recent visit. Symptoms of asthma persisted in as much as 86. 5 % of patients. During recent examination there were more positive results in asthmatic patients comparing with the control group in histamine challenge (61. 3 vs. 5. 3 %, p< 0. 01), eosinophile cationic protein (41. 7 vs. 5. 3 %, p< 0. 05), prick tests (45. 9 vs. 10. 5 %, p< 0. 05). Positive results of the present histamine challenge test and elevated eosinophils in sputum were more frequent (p< 0. 05) in patients with occupational asthma due to high molecular weight allergens than to low molecular weight allergens...|$|E
40|$|Background: Hairdressers are occupationally {{exposed to}} many {{allergenic}} and irritating substances. Additionally, hairdressing apprentices {{are exposed to}} the same allergens as professional hairdressers, {{due to the fact that}} vocational training starts in the beginning of the education. This study was undertaken to investigate early occurrence of sensitization to <b>occupational</b> <b>allergens</b> in hairdressing apprentices before the onset of the vocational training. Material and Methods: Three hundred and seven hairdressing apprentices were assessed using a questionnaire and skin prick tests (SPTs) to common and <b>occupational</b> <b>allergens.</b> The level of total and serum specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) to <b>occupational</b> <b>allergens</b> was evaluated and spirometry was performed. Results: At least one skin and/or respiratory and/or conjunctival symptom was reported by 29. 9 % of subjects. Among subjects with at least one symptom, 28. 2 % of them were atopic whereas among 43. 4 % of them total IgE level was elevated. Atopy was found in 20 % cases. In the case of one apprentice, positive SPT for paraphenylenediamine was found. Nearly 33 % of apprentices had elevated total IgE level and 5 of them had specific IgE for <b>occupational</b> <b>allergens.</b> Conclusions: The study revealed that hairdressing apprentices might be sensitized to <b>occupational</b> <b>allergens</b> even before the beginning of vocational training, due to prior non-professional exposure to hairdressing agents. Furthermore, many of them report skin, respiratory and conjunctival symptoms, often connected with chronic disease diagnosis. Thus, candidates for hairdressers should be examined thoroughly before the start of the education and tests for allergy to hairdressing substances are indicated. Med Pr 2016; 67 (5) : 567 – 57...|$|R

40|$|Asthma is a {{heterogeneous}} lung disorder characterized by airway obstruction, inflammation and eosinophil infiltration into the lung. Both genetics {{and environmental factors}} influence the expression of asthma, and not all asthma {{is the result of}} a specific immune response to allergen. Numerous asthma phenotypes have been described, including occupational asthma, and therapeutic strategies for asthma control are similar regardless of phenotype. We hypothesized that mechanistic pathways leading to asthma symptoms in the effector phase of the disorder differ with the inciting allergen. Since route of allergen exposure can influence mechanistic pathways, mice were sensitized by identical routes with a high molecular weight <b>occupational</b> <b>allergen</b> ovalbumin and a low molecular weight <b>occupational</b> <b>allergen</b> trimellitic anhydride (TMA). Different statistical methods with varying selection criteria resulted in identification of similar candidate genes. Array data are intended to provide candidate genes for hypothesis generation and further experimentation. Continued studies focused on genes showing minimal changes in the TMA-induced model but with clear up-regulation in the ovalbumin model. Two of these genes, arginase 1 and eotaxin 1 are the focus of continuing investigations in mouse models of asthma regarding differences in mechanistic pathways depending on the allergen. Micro-array data from the ovalbumin and TMA model of asthma were also compared to previous data using Aspergillus as allergen to identify putative asthma ‘signature genes’, i. e. genes up-regulated with all 3 allergens. Array studies provide candidate genes to identify common mechanistic pathways in the effector phase, as well as mechanistic pathways unique to individual allergens...|$|E
40|$|Workplace-related {{allergen}} {{exposure is}} an important risk factor {{for the development of}} occupational allergy and asthma. New allergen specific semi-quantitative tests, Lateral Flow Immuno Assays (LFIAs), have been developed for the detection of <b>occupational</b> <b>allergen</b> exposure directly at the workplaces. These tests are quick and simple to perform, the results are visible within minutes and easily interpretable. In this article, the principle of LFIA is described and the practical application of the immunoassays for mouse and rat urinary allergens in a laboratory animal facility is presented. The results show that the sensitivity of the rapid tests is sufficient for the detection of small amounts of allergen in extracts from deposited dust. Thus they can help to reveal the allergen sources and to develop preventive and interventional measures. Furthermore, the LFIAs are especially suited for the direct on-site demonstration of allergen contaminations to staff members and, therefore, useful in occupational hygiene practice. This method is also a feasible screening system before starting extensive measurements of airborne allergens...|$|E
40|$|Exposure to high {{molecular}} weight sensitizers of biological origin is an important risk factor {{for the development of}} asthma and rhinitis. Most of the causal allergens have been defined based on their reactivity with IgE antibodies, and in many cases, the molecular structure and function of the allergens have been established. Significant information on allergen levels that cause sensitization and allergic symptoms for several major environmental and occupational allergens has been reported. Monitoring of {{high molecular}} weight allergens and allergen carrier particles {{is an important part of}} the management of allergic respiratory diseases and requires standardized allergen assessment methods for occupational and environmental (indoor and outdoor) allergen exposure. The aim of this EAACI task force was to review the essential points for monitoring environmental and <b>occupational</b> <b>allergen</b> exposure including sampling strategies and methods, processing of dust samples, allergen analysis, and quantification. The paper includes a summary of different methods for sampling and allergen quantification, as well as their pros and cons for various exposure settings.

40|$|Introduction The role of {{cross-reactive}} carbohydrate determinants (CCDs) in diagnostics {{of occupational}} allergy remains unclarified and its clinical relevance is still questioned. The {{aim of the}} study was to assess the frequency of positive response to CCDs in the subjects with suspected occupational allergy and the relationship between other diagnostic test results and final diagnosis. Material and methods The study group included 201 patients. They underwent clinical examination, skin prick test (SPT) to common and <b>occupational</b> <b>allergens,</b> specific serum immunoglobulin (sIgE) determinations, spirometry and specific inhalation challenge test. Moreover, sIgE to CCDs from bromelain was assessed in all subjects. Results Occupational respiratory allergy was recognized in 64. 3 % of CCD-positive and 52. 4 % of CCD-negative patients. Positive SPT results to common and <b>occupational</b> <b>allergens</b> were found in 64. 3 % and 35. 7 % of CCD-positive subjects, respectively. In all subjects with CCDs, the sIgE to grass pollens as well as to <b>occupational</b> <b>allergens</b> were detected. The total IgE level > 100 kU/l was significantly associated with the presence of sIgE to CCDs. Conclusions sIgE to CCDs were found in 7 % of subjects suspected to suffer from occupational respiratory allergy. The presence of CCDs is not significantly associated with occupational respiratory allergy. It is also not more frequent in subjects reporting work-related respiratory symptoms in whom occupational allergy was not confirmed. The elevated total IgE level was related with CCD positivity. In patients with suspected occupational allergy, the presence of sIgE to CCDs in serum did not indicate the irrelevance of positive sIgE to <b>occupational</b> <b>allergens...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{survey was}} carried out on {{respiratory}} symptoms and skin prick test response to common allergens (atopy), storage mites, and <b>occupational</b> <b>allergens</b> among 226 bakers and pastry makers from 105 small businesses in northern Italy. Atopy was present in 54 workers (23. 4 %); 40 workers (17. 7 %) were skin positive {{to at least one}} storage mite, 27 (11. 9 %) to wheat flour and 17 (7. 5 %) to alpha-amylase. Work related asthma was reported by 11 (4. 9 %) workers and rhinoconjunctivitis by 31 (17. 7 %); 22 workers (10. 2 %) complained of chronic bronchitis. The distribution of skin prick test results among bakers and among 119 white collar workers did not indicate (by logistic analysis) an increased risk for bakers to skin sensitisation to common allergens, storage mite, or to a group of five flours. Sensitisation to wheat flour, on the other hand, was present only among exposed workers. Skin sensitisation to <b>occupational</b> <b>allergens</b> was significantly associated with atopy (p < 0. 001), smoking habit (p = 0. 015), and work seniority (p = 0. 027). The risk of work related symptoms was associated with sensitisation to wheat or alpha-amylase, and with atopy, but not with sensitisation to storage mites, work seniority, or smoking habit. The results of the study indicate that there is still a significant risk of allergic respiratory disease among Italian bakers. Not only wheat allergens, but also alpha-amylase must be considered as causative agents, although sensitisation to storage mites is not important in the occupational allergic response. Atopy must be regarded as an important predisposing factor for skin sensitisation to <b>occupational</b> <b>allergens</b> and for the onset of symptoms at work. The data confirm that for effective prevention, greater care should be taken not only in limiting environmental exposure, but also in identifying susceptible people...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Fungi {{belong to}} common allergens, {{which can be}} found both in {{occupational}} and nonoccupational environment. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the frequency and factors associated with mould allergy among bakers and farmers reporting work-related respiratory symptoms. The study group comprised 117 bakers and 83 farmers reporting work-related respiratory symptoms. Skin prick tests (SPT) with common, fungal and <b>occupational</b> <b>allergens,</b> estimation of serum total IgE level, spirometry, histamine test and specific inhalative challenge test with <b>occupational</b> <b>allergens</b> were performed in all subjects. The prevalence of hypersensitivity to fungal species was higher among farmers (32. 5 %) than bakers (16. 2 %). Positive SPT with mould allergens were found among 10. 8 % farmers and 6. 8 % bakers with occupational allergy. The fungi allergens giving positive SPT results most frequently were Candida albicans, Levures mélanges, Aspergillus mix. and Charbons cerealiers in both groups. Among mould allergens, hypersensitivity to Aspergillus genus was the most common in farmers and bakers group, while among Saccharomyces − Candida albicans sensitization was the most frequently detected. Mould hypersensitivity is related to occupational respiratory allergy, especially to asthma and rhinitis in farmers, and occupational asthma in bakers. Although sensitization to Saccharomyces was more frequent, similar correlation was not observed...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Wood dust is a known <b>occupational</b> <b>allergen</b> {{that may}} induce, in exposed workers, {{respiratory}} diseases including asthma and allergic rhinitis. Samba (obeche, Triplochiton scleroxylon) is a tropical tree, which grows in West Africa, therefore, Polish workers are rarely exposed to it. This paper describes {{a case of}} occupational asthma caused by samba wood dust. Material and Methods: The patient with suspicion of occupational asthma due to wood dust was examined at the Department of Occupational Diseases and Clinical Toxicology in the Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine. Clinical evaluation included: analysis of occupational history, skin prick tests (SPT) to common and occupational allergens, determination of serum specific IgE to occupational allergens, serial spirometry measurements, metacholine challenge test and specific inhalation challenge test with samba dust. Results: SPT and specific serum IgE assessment revealed sensitization to common and occupational allergens including samba. Spirometry measurements showed mild obstruction. Metacholine challenge test revealed {{a high level of}} bronchial hyperactivity. Specific inhalation challenge test was positive and cellular changes in nasal lavage and induced sputum confirmed allergic reaction to samba.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Vegetable pollen {{is a rare}} {{source of}} {{occupational}} allergens. Occupational allergy has only been described {{in the case of}} paprika pollen and tomato pollen. We describe a new source of occupational pollen allergy. AIM: To study the incidence and the impact of broccoli and cauliflower pollen allergy in employees involved in classical plant breeding. METHODS: Fifty-four employees of five companies working with cauliflower (Brassica oleracea botrytis) and broccoli (B. oleracea italica/cymosa) pollen were eligible for complete evaluation. Allergy to cauliflower and broccoli pollen was evaluated by questionnaire and determination of sensitization by radioallergosorbent test (RAST) and skin-prick tests (SPT). SPT and RAST were performed with a panel of commercial and homemade extracts from cauliflower and broccoli pollen. RESULTS: Work-related symptoms such as rhinitis, conjunctivitis, asthma and urticaria caused by B. oleracea pollen were reported by 44 % of the participants (24 / 54), of whom all but one had positive SPT for cauliflower- and/or broccoli-pollen/flower extracts and 58 % (14 / 24) had positive RAST results. Symptoms had developed within the first 2 years in 33 % of the patients. Six patients had to stop or change work.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (or relatives) {{crushing}} drug tablets {{for patients}} with difficulties in swallowing {{are at risk of}} developing sensitization via airborne exposure. Tetrazepam, in particular, is increasingly being described as an important <b>occupational</b> <b>allergen</b> in this regard, although other drugs are also involved. OBJECTIVES: To identify the allergenic culprits in 4 patients, namely 2 nurses, 1 pharmacy assistant, and 1 spouse, who all regularly crushed tablets of systemic drugs and presented with severe airborne dermatitis. METHODS: The patients were patch tested with all of the drugs that they handled, as well as with potential cross-sensitizing molecules. RESULTS: All 4 patients reacted to tetrazepam and other benzodiazepines, some of which they had not previously come into contact with, which favours cross-reactivity rather than concomitant sensitization. These patients also had positive reactions to several other non-structurally related drugs for which, in some cases, there was no history of exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects having to crush drugs, in either an occupational or a non-occupational context, and who present with dermatitis suspected of being airborne-induced, should be patch tested with all contacted medicaments, as well as with possible cross-reacting molecules. Prevention by the use of crushing devices and protective measures (gloves and masks) when medications are handled should be advised. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The protein {{tropomyosin}} (TM) is a known major allergen {{present in}} shellfish causing frequent food allergies. TM {{is also an}} <b>occupational</b> <b>allergen</b> generated in the working environment of snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) processing plants. The TM protein was purified from both claw and leg meats of snow crab and analyzed by electrospray ionization and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) using hybrid quadruple time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (QqToF-MS). The native polypeptide molecular weight of TM {{was determined to be}} 32 733 Da. The protein was further characterized using the `bottom-up¿ MS approach. A peptide mass fingerprinting was obtained by two different enzymatic digestions and de novo sequencing of the most abundant peptides performed.

The immunological reactivity of snow crab extract was evaluated using specific antibodies and allergenic reactivity assessed with serum of allergic patients. Subsequently, a signature peptide for TM was identified and evaluated in terms of identity and homology using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST). The identification of a signature peptide for the allergen TM using MALDI-QqToF-MS will be critical for the sensitive and specific quantification of this highly allergenic protein in the work place...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Asthma is {{a complex}} disease {{characterized}} by an intricate interplay of both heritable and environmental factors. Understanding the mechanisms through which genes and environment interact {{represents one of the}} major challenges for pulmonary researchers. This review provides an overview of the recently published literature on gene-environment (G × E) interactions in asthma, with a special focus on the new methodological developments in the postgenomewide association studies (GWAS) era. RECENT FINDINGS: Most recent studies on G × E interaction in asthma used a candidate-gene approach. Candidate-gene studies considering exposure to outdoor air pollutants showed significant interactions mainly with variants in the GSTP 1 gene on asthma in children. G × E studies on passive and active smoking, including one genomewide interaction study, identified novel genes of susceptibility to asthma and a time-dependent effect of maternal smoking. Other recent studies on asthma found interactions between candidate genes and <b>occupational</b> <b>allergen</b> exposure and several domestic exposures such as endotoxin and gas cooking. New methods were developed to efficiently estimate G × E interaction in GWAS, and a pathway-based strategy to select an enriched gene-set for G × E studies has recently been proposed. SUMMARY: The G × E studies presented in this review offer a good example on how candidate-gene approaches can complement and help in validating GWAS findings...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Family {{members of}} {{laboratory}} animal workers {{are at risk}} of developing allergy to laboratory animals. Little is known about the spreading of laboratory animal allergens outside the animal facilities. OBJECTIVE: To assess the presence of laboratory animal allergens in dust collected from mattresses of laboratory animal workers and unexposed controls. METHODS: Mouse and rat urinary proteins were measured in samples of mattress dust collected by laboratory animal workers and unexposed controls. In addition, rat and mouse allergens were determined in extracts of hair-covering caps, used during laboratory animal work, to estimate spreading of allergen through dust captured on hair. Allergen concentrations on hair caps were compared with exposure measured by personal airborne dust sampling. RESULTS: Levels of rat urinary allergens (RUA) and mouse urinary allergens (MUA) and mouse urinary protein (MUP) 8, a specific pheromone-binding mouse allergen, were significantly higher in mattress samples of laboratory animal workers than in those of controls. Hair-covering caps used in animal facilities harboured large amounts of RUA and MUA, which correlated significantly with exposure measured by the personal sampling technique in the animal facility. CONCLUSIONS: Occupational laboratory animal allergens are detectable in mattress dust of laboratory animal workers. Transfer of allergens via uncovered hair of animal workers is likely contributing to this phenomenon.

40|$|Allergy to Diplotaxis erucoides pollen: {{occupational}} sensitization and cross-reactivity with other common pollens Background: Diplotaxis erucoides {{is a common}} weed of the Brassicaceae family widespread in southern and central Europe. Methods: A total of 410 consecutive patients referred for allergy study of rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma were skin tested with D. erucoides pollen, 14 proving positive. A purified D. erucoides pollen extract was prepared to perform quantitative skin tests, provocation tests, immunoblotting, and EIA inhibition in the 14 sensitized patients. Results: Three patients, directly involved in viniculture, had rhinoconjunctivitis related to D. erucoides pollen. No D. erucoides-related symptoms were observed in most patients, who were also sensitized to Artemisia pollen. RAST was positive in 12 / 14 patients and nasal provocation tests in 9 / 12. The molecular masses of the most prevalent IgE-binding proteins ranged from 26 to 27. 5 and from 31 to 34 kDa. D. erucoides pollen inhibited the IgE-binding of other sensitizing pollens in the three viniculture workers, whereas both Artemisia and D. erucoides pollen produced similar heterologous inhibition in the pooled serum of the remaining, nonclinically affected, D. erucoides-sensitized patients. Conclusions: D. erucoides pollen {{may be an important}} prevalent aeroallergen, particularly in rural areas.

40|$|Sensitization of {{guinea pigs}} by {{intradermal}} injections of the <b>occupational</b> <b>allergen</b> trimellitic anhydride (TMA) in oily vehicle {{has been shown}} to be very reproducible. We studied the effect of intradermal sensitization with ovalbumin (OA) in oily vehicle on immune and airway responses in guinea pigs. We also compared airway responses to trimellitic anhydride or Dermatophagoides farinae (DF; mite) with those to OA in guinea pigs intradermally sensitized to respective allergens. Three to four weeks after sensitization, the animals were challenged with intratracheal instillation of these allergens. Intradermal injections with OA developed dose-dependently specific IgG 1 antibodies to OA demonstrated by ELISA. In animals sensitized with different doses of OA in corn oil vehicle, a challenge with OA induced a reversely dose-dependent airflow obstruction and airway plasma exudation. In contrast, animals sensitized with OA in saline vehicle had dose-dependent airway responses to OA. Challenge with OA caused an immediate peak and subsequently persistent airflow obstruction, whereas this response to either TMA guinea pig serum albumin or Df was slowly progressive in animals sensitized to respective allergens. The animals sensitized to TMA or Df may show a different profile of airway responses following the challenge compared to OA. Intradermal sensitization may be a valuable method of sensitization for the development of an animal model of airway allergy to different types of allergens, including chemicals or mites...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In 1999, an {{extensive}} study among bell pepper growers {{showed that a}} predatory mite, Amblyseius cucumeris, is a potentially relevant source of occupational allergens because 23 % of the population had positive skin prick test reactions. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether cross-reactivity between A. cucumeris and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus {{is responsible for the}} cosensitization to both mite species found in 58. 7 % of A. cucumeris-sensitized greenhouse workers. METHODS: Fifteen serum samples from greenhouse workers with work-related inhalant allergy and a positive radioallergosorbent test (RAST) reaction to A. cucumeris or D. pteronyssinus were selected for immunoblot analysis using extracts of both mites. A subselection (n = 5) was used for RAST and immunoblot inhibition to investigate potential cross-reactivity. RESULTS: On immunoblot, 2 distinct patterns were observed: one pattern showed common protein bands in A. cucumeris and D. pteronyssinus blots suggestive of cross-reactivity between A. cucumeris and D. pteronyssinus and the other pattern showed no shared protein bands. Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus RAST inhibition with A. cucumeris extract was low in 4 serum samples (< 25 % inhibition) and nearly absent in 1 serum sample; A. cucumeris RAST inhibition with D. pteronyssinus extract was high in 1 serum sample (75 % inhibition), low in 2 serum samples (35 % and < 15 % inhibition), and absent in 2 serum samples.

The result suggested obstructive syndrome in 14 (13, 33 %) subjects (8 showed positivity to tested seasonal and perennial allergens, 6 non. specific bronchial hyperreactivity to the methacholine test), contact allergic dermatitis to <b>occupational</b> <b>allergens</b> in 7 (6, 66 %) subjects without respiratory effects, mucous inflammation and function upper airways alterations in 24 (22, 85 %) subjects (8 also showed positivity to tested seasonal and perennial allergens). The main problems were detected in the upper airways. In 16 subjects (15, 23 %), non smokers, the data showed compatible effects with irritative pathology. We conclude the dental technicians often worked alone or in small laboratories without adeguate pollutants control...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{estimate}} {{the incidence of}} specific IgE sensitization and allergic respiratory symptoms among UK bakery and flour mill workers; and to examine the roles of flour aeroal-lergen and total dust exposures in determining these outcomes. Methods: A cohort of 300 new employees, without previous occupational exposure to flour, were followed prospectively for a median (range) of 40 (1 – 91) months. Cases—defined as those developing work-related symptoms or a positive skin prick test to flour or a-amylase during follow up—were compared with controls, matched for duration of employment. Exposures to flour aeroallergen and total inhalable dust were estimated using a questionnaire and personal sampling techniques. Results: Incidence rates for work-related eye/nose and chest symptoms were 11. 8 and 4. 1 cases per 100 person years (py), respectively. Fewer employees developed positive skin prick tests to flour (2. 2 cases per 100 py) or a-amylase (2. 5 cases per 100 py). Positive skin tests to <b>occupational</b> <b>allergens</b> were more common among those with new work-related symp-toms. There were clear relationships between the risks of developing work-related symptoms or a positive skin prick test and three categories of estimated exposure to total dust or flou...|$|R
40|$|Snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) {{proteins}} {{have been}} recognized as {{an important source of}} both food and <b>occupational</b> <b>allergens.</b> While snow crab causes a significant occupational allergy, only one novel allergen has recently been fully characterized. The muscle proteins from snow crab legs were profiled by SDS-PAGE. Several of these proteins were characterized using tandem mass spectrometry. Five proteins were identified; sarcoplasmic Ca-binding (20 kDa), arginine kinase (40), troponin (23 kDa) and ?-actine (42 kDa) and smooth endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 +ATPase (113 kDa). Immunoblotting using serumof sixteen allergic patients resulted in strong reactivity with the 40 -kDa protein in seven patients (43 %). This protein was purified by chromatography and subsequently de novo sequenced using matrix assisted laser desorption ionization and electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. We identified a second important allergen, arginine kinase, in snow crab, designated Chi o 3. Based on identity and homology analysis, using bioinformatics tools, a signature peptide was identified as a chemical surrogate for arginine kinase. The suitability of this signature peptide was tested for analytically representing the arginine kinase, by performing a multi-reaction monitoring tandem mass spectrometry approach on actual air filter samples collected from a simulated crab processing plant...|$|R
40|$|Background: Sensitization to flour or fungal {{alpha-amylase}} is {{a prerequisite}} for the development of respiratory allergy in bakers. The knowledge of <b>occupational</b> <b>allergen</b> sensitization among bakery workers will facilitate the implementation of preventive measures for respiratory allergies in bakeries. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence and factors associated with sensitization to wheat flour and α-amylase in bakers in Douala. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 42 of the 151 bakeries that are present in the city of Douala. Demographics, clinical data, as well as results of skin prick tests to wheat flour, α-amylase and common aeroallergens were collected from all participants. A logistic regression model of the SPSS. 20 software was used to identify factors associated with sensitization to wheat flour and α-amylase. Results: Of the 229 participants included in the study, 222 (96. 9 %) were male. The mean age was 36. 3 ± 8. 9 years. The prevalence of sensitization to flour and α-amylase were 16. 6 % and 8. 3 % respectively. After multivariate analysis, factors associated with sensitization to flour were work seniority and sensitization to storage mites while an age of 30 years and above was the only factor associated with sensitization to α-amylase. Conclusion: Bakers in Douala are at risk of sensitization to occupational allergens. The environmental hygiene in bakeries, health surveillance and the use of personal protective equipment could reduce the risk of respiratory allergies among bakers...|$|E
40|$|Background <b>Occupational</b> <b>allergen</b> {{exposure}} assessment usually requires airborne dust sampling at the worksite followed by dust extraction and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) analysis at the laboratory. Use of semiquantitative lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) may allow a more rapid detection procedure with direct on-site demonstration of a bioallergen exposure hazard. Objective In a field study, we evaluated a recently developed LFIA for fungal alpha-amylase, an important bakery allergen. Methods Airborne and surface dust (wipe) samples and samples from flours and baking additives {{used at the}} workplace were collected in 5 industrial bakeries and tested in the LFIA for fungal amylase. For comparison, amylase was measured in sample eluates with the reference EIA method. Results Sensitivity of the LFIA was 1 to 10 ng/mL, and of EIA, 25 pg/mL. In LFIA, most flour samples, 84 % of wipe samples, 26 % of personal airborne dust, {{and none of the}} 26 ambient air dust samples produced a visible reaction. Wipe samples from dough-making areas and flour samples gave the strongest reactions. All extracts with > 5 ng allergen per milliliter showed a positive LFIA reaction. Conclusion The LFIA for fungal amylase is an easy and rapid method to demonstrate the allergen directly at the worksite in less than 10 to 20 minutes. Similar LFIA methods may be used for other occupational allergens in other work environments. Clinical implications Lateral flow immunoassays for occupational allergens may be of great value in occupational hygiene surveys to demonstrate directly to workers and supervisors the hazards of work-related bioallergen exposure...|$|E
40|$|Background: Epicutaneous {{sensitization}} to allergens {{is important}} in the pathogenesis of not only skin inflammation such as atopic dermatitis but also "atopic march" in allergic diseases such as asthma and food allergies. We here examined antibody production and skin barrier dysfunction in mice epicutaneously administered papain, a plant-derived <b>occupational</b> <b>allergen</b> belonging to the same family of cysteine proteases as mite major group 1 allergens. Methods: Papain and Staphylococcus aureus V 8 protease were patched on the backs of hairless mice. Tran- sepidermal water loss was measured to evaluate the skin barrier dysfunction caused by the proteases. Papain or that treated with an irreversible inhibitor specific to cysteine proteases, E 64, was painted onto the ear lobes of mice of an inbred strain C 57 BL/ 6. Serum total IgE levels and papain-specific IgE and IgG antibodies were measured by ELISA. Results: Papain and V 8 protease patched on the backs of hairless mice caused skin barrier dysfunction and increased serum total IgE levels, and papain induced the production of papain-specific IgG 1, IgG 2 a, and IgG 2 b. Papain painted onto the ear lobes of C 57 BL/ 6 mice induced papain-specific IgE, IgG 1, IgG 2 c, and IgG 2 b, whereas papain treated with E 64 did not. IgG 1 was the most significantly induced papain-specific IgG subclass among those measured. Conclusions: We demonstrated that the epicutaneous administration of protease not only disrupted skin barrier function, but also induced IgE and IgG responses in a manner dependent on its protease activity. These results suggest that protease activity contained in environmental sources contributes to sensitization through an epicutaneous route...|$|E
40|$|Bronchial asthma is {{a common}} disease and an {{important}} cause of morbidity among both children and adults. Tobacco smoking, both active and passive i. e., exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) has got important effects on asthma. Smoking by adults causes bronchial irritation and precipitates acute episodes. It also increases bronchial responsiveness and causes airway sensitization to several <b>occupational</b> <b>allergens.</b> Smoking may also increase the disease severity. Continued smoking by adult asthmatics is the likely cause of irreversibility of airway obstruction and development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. ETS exposure affects asthma in a similar fashion. Parental smoking is commonly associated with increased asthma symptoms, respiratory infections, acute episodes and frequent hospitalization of children. Bronchial responsiveness and airway sensitization may also increase. Childhood exposure to smoking is also considered as {{a risk factor for}} the development of asthma. Similarly, in utero exposure to maternal smoking may be independently responsible for early onset asthma. ETS exposure in adult asthmatics from smoking by spouses, siblings or colleagues is equally troublesome. There is increased morbidity and poorer asthma control. Asthmatic symptoms sharply decline after the ETS exposure is reduced...|$|R
40|$|Oilseed rape flour: another <b>allergen</b> causing <b>{{occupational}}</b> asthma among farmers Background: Farmers {{are exposed}} {{to a wide variety}} of sensitizers. Since occupational asthma (OA) can lead to permanent disability, exposure discontinuation is the preferred treatment. When this is not possible, the identification of the causative allergen may allow an alternative therapy. Methods: We present three farmers diagnosed with OA as a consequence of handling fodder. We carried out skin tests with common and <b>occupational</b> <b>allergens</b> and with oilseed rape (OSR) extract. Total and specific serum IgE levels were measured. The patients underwent the OSR-bronchial provocation test (OSR-BPT). The day before and 24 h after the OSR-BPT, the methacholine (M) -BPT and induced sputum were performed. Eosinophil percentages and ECP levels were measured in the sputum samples. Results: OSR sensitization (skin tests and specific serum IgE) was detected in all the patients. The OSR-BPT elicited early responses in two subjects. Methacholine sensitivity, sputum eosinophils, and sputum ECP levels increased 24 h after the OSR-BPT in all the patients. Conclusions: We have demonstrated that inhalation of OSR flour causes bronchoconstriction, induces an eosinophilic inflammatory bronchial response, and increases bronchial hyperresponsiveness in sensitized asthmatics. OSR flour contained in animal fodder should be considered another potential cause of OA among farmers...|$|R
40|$|Lower {{respiratory}} {{symptoms in}} bakery workers may be induced by wheat flour and endotoxins. We hypothesized that endotoxins from wheat flour may stimulate innate immunity and that interleukin- 18 (IL- 18) gene polymorphisms may affect their regulatory role in innate immune responses to endotoxins. To investigate the genetic contribution of IL- 18 to sensitization to wheat flour, {{we performed a}} genetic association study of IL- 18 in Korean bakery workers. A total of 373 bakery workers undertook a questionnaire regarding work-related symptoms. Skin prick tests with common and <b>occupational</b> <b>allergens</b> were performed and specific antibodies to wheat flour were measured by ELISA. Three polymorphisms of the IL- 18 gene (- 607 A/C, - 137 G/C, 8674 C/G) were genotyped, and the functional effects of the polymorphisms were analyzed using the luciferase reporter assay. Genotypes of - 137 G/C (GC or CC) and haplotype ht 3 [ACC] {{showed a significant association}} with the rate of sensitization to wheat flour. Luciferase activity assay indicated ht 3 [AC] as a low transcript haplotype. In conclusion, the regulatory role of IL- 18 in lipopolysaccharide-induced responses in bakery workers may be affected by this polymorphism, thus contributing to the development of sensitization to wheat flour and work-related respiratory symptoms...|$|R
