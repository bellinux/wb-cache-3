25|$|MGM Home Entertainment has {{released}} both seasons of The Outer Limits on DVD in Region 1. In 2007, they re-released the series in three separate sets. In October 2008, MGM released a 7-disc box set featuring all 49 episodes of the series. The re-releases of Season 2 correctly claim three discs {{in the set}} on the <b>outer</b> <b>packaging,</b> whereas the individual slim cases with the DVDs inside rather confusingly claim only two.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] DVD {{was first}} {{released}} in January 2001, {{followed by a}} re-release (with new <b>outer</b> <b>packaging)</b> in July 2007. There was a Special Edition DVD release in May 2011 {{as part of the}} Mannequin Mania box set, along with Terror of the Autons; it boasting additional special features and improved remastering. All four episodes have been issued for sale on iTunes.|$|E
2500|$|The Region 1 DVDs are {{on three}} discs (with the {{exception}} of the final season set, which has four discs), whereas the Region 2 DVDs are presented across four discs, but in Germany the fourth to seventh seasons are also three disc sets. [...] The Region 2 packaging and programme menus for Season 1 vary compared to the Region 1 releases. The Season 3 menus in Region 1 are in widescreen, but [...] in Region 2. The Region 1 releases of Seasons 2 and 3 consist of (deliberate) [...] "holes" [...] in the outer packaging—these do not exist in the Region 2 releases; in fact, the Season 3 <b>outer</b> <b>packaging</b> is physically printed where the hole would be in the Region 1 packaging.|$|E

50|$|There are {{different}} challenges, such as ensuring that termites do not consume the <b>outer</b> <b>packages</b> and labels or that storage {{is free of}} other vermin such as rats.|$|R
5|$|Various other {{products}} related to Black Thunder are {{or have been}} marketed by Yuraku for limited periods. The list below contains some of the variations on the Black Thunder candy bar, or special editions of the <b>outer</b> <b>package.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Several smaller {{companies}} had conceived of frozen dinners earlier (see Invention section below), {{but the first}} to achieve success was Swanson. The first Swanson-brand TV Dinner was produced in the United States and consisted of a Thanksgiving meal of turkey, cornbread dressing, frozen peas and sweet potatoes packaged in a tray like those used at the time for airline food service. Each item was placed in its own compartment. The trays proved to be useful: the entire dinner could {{be removed from the}} <b>outer</b> <b>packaging</b> as a unit; the aluminum tray could be heated directly in the oven without any extra dishes; and one could eat the meal directly from the same tray. The product was cooked for 25 minutes at [...] and fit nicely on a TV tray table. The original TV Dinner sold for 98 cents, and had a production estimate of 5,000 dinners for the first year.|$|E
50|$|The <b>outer</b> <b>packaging</b> is matte pink {{with the}} name in {{metallic}} pink calligraphy.|$|E

500|$|Starting in 2000, a {{candy bar}} called Golden Chop ( [...] ) {{appeared}} on the market containing similar ingredients as the Black Thunder, and the <b>outer</b> <b>package</b> presents similar colors, design, and font style. [...] It uses the advertising slogan [...] "Fit to be eaten at lightning speed".|$|R
50|$|As with {{previous}} releases, the band chose a non-standard packaging {{instead of the}} conventional jewel case. The <b>outer</b> <b>package</b> is a small box with flap, containing a foldout multipanel slipcover with information, and a CD holder in the last section. A Far Cry From Here was launched on 14 April 2007 at Zouk.|$|R

50|$|The lack of {{an option}} to switch to left-handed has caused discontent for some left-handed users who have {{purchased}} the game as this is not advertised on the <b>outer</b> <b>packaging.</b>|$|E
50|$|This serial was {{released}} on VHS in February 1996. The story {{was released}} as a Region 2 DVD on 24 July 2006. It was released in Region 1 on 7 November 2006. It was re-released with new <b>outer</b> <b>packaging</b> on 2 July 2007.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the company}} sources {{components}} from its approved sources, they are put though a formal visual inspection by degreed quality engineers, IPC-certified technicians, and other inspectors to examine parts from the <b>outer</b> <b>packaging</b> inward. Parts that pass visual inspection may {{move on to}} the next level of inspection.|$|E
50|$|Many times {{cosmetic}} products are packaged in multiple layers. Whenever {{it is difficult}} to detect for the consumer, the number of units should be listed on the <b>outer</b> <b>package,</b> which should contain details about how to use the product and warnings on what to do if it is misused. It is essential that the product is protected from environmental elements such as mould and bacteria.|$|R
5000|$|Entrepreneur BJ Cunningham {{invested}} {{his life}} savings {{to create and}} market an additive-free smoking product called Death. He founded the Enlightened Tobacco Company in 1991. [...] Its product disclosed its hazardous nature by prominently displaying skull and crossbones on its <b>outer</b> <b>package</b> and came in two varieties; Death, and Death Lights. [...] The product was marketed to the “young underground punk rock” consumer market. [...] The products were sold for a time via mail order from Luxembourg to avoid the United Kingdom's excise tax, however after some time the Customs and Excise department disallowed this sales channel.|$|R
50|$|Thousands of tons {{of medical}} {{supplies}} are discarded in the United States every day. This occurs largely because U.S. government regulations force hospitals to discard any unused medical supplies in an opened <b>outer</b> <b>package,</b> even if the remaining items are individually wrapped and sterile. These supplies are either incinerated or deposited in landfills. Meanwhile, in developing nations, thousands of patients are turned away from hospitals and medical centers {{due to a lack}} of supplies. Charash created Doc to Dock to rectify this imbalance. The organization also benefits the U.S. environment by reducing the strain on landfills.|$|R
50|$|Features remakes of all {{the songs}} from the Korean soundtrack (including the main theme). The largest remake so far.The <b>outer</b> <b>{{packaging}}</b> (box) is dark green, while the inner packaging (a booklet with photos which holds the CD) is mint green, a unique combination of colors unlike the first two albums.|$|E
50|$|The album artwork is Oldfield's {{trademark}} bent tubular bell {{shape in}} silver, {{based upon the}} original 1973 Tubular Bells album cover, set upon a grey background. The artwork itself does not contain any text and typically a sticker with Oldfield's name and the album title are placed on the <b>outer</b> <b>packaging.</b>|$|E
50|$|Features remakes of {{all three}} songs from the Korean soundtrack (including the main theme) and songs {{inspired}} by Autumn Tale. The <b>outer</b> <b>packaging</b> (box) is white while the inner packaging (a booklet w/ photos which holds the CD) is blue, which is {{a reversal of the}} second album's colors. Both were released simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|Icelandic Glacial uses natural {{renewable}} {{energy in the}} form of geothermal power to fuel production. The company implements a shipping policy from its mid-Atlantic location that uses otherwise empty cargo slots for shipments of product to the US and mainland Europe. The bottles are 100% recyclable including the labels and the <b>outer</b> box <b>packaging</b> uses 75% post consumer recycled materials.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{represents}} the extended {{version of the}} conference paper "Developing highly-integrated subcutaneous biochips for remote monitoring of human metabolism" presented at the IEEE Sensors Conference 2012, and presents data on assembly, packaging and short term in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility evaluation of a fully implantable biosensor array. The device was realized integrating three building blocks: 1) a multielectrode platform; 2) an inductive coil; and 3) an integrated circuit. The entire system measures 2. 2 mm x 2. 2 mm x 15 mm. Corrosion of electronic components and leaking of potentially hazardous substances in the body is prevented with a conformal coating of Parylene C, while an <b>outer</b> <b>package</b> of medical grade silicone was employed to create a soft shell suitable for implantation. Biocompatibility experiments did not show in vitro cytotoxicity in the considered period of 7 days, while comparison between 7 and 30 days in vivo implantations showed significant reduction of the inflammatory response in time, suggesting normal host recovery...|$|R
5000|$|During World War II, Steinweiss became Columbia Records' {{advertising}} manager. He {{left for}} {{a job at the}} Navy's Training and Development Center in New York City, where he produced teaching materials and cautionary posters. [...] After the war, Steinweiss freelanced for Columbia. During one lunch meeting there, the company's president, Ted Wallerstein, introduced him to an innovation that the company was about to unveil: the long-playing record. But there was a problem. The heavy, folded kraft paper used to protect 78 rpm records left marks on the vinyl microgroove when 33 1/3 rpm LPs were stacked. [...] Steinweiss was asked to develop a jacket for the new format and, with help from his brother-in-law, found a manufacturer willing to invest about $250,000 in equipment. Steinweiss had the original patent for what became the industry packaging standard (he did not develop the inner sleeve, only the <b>outer</b> <b>package),</b> but under his contract with Columbia he had to waive all rights to any inventions made while working there.|$|R
50|$|Features remakes of {{the main}} theme from the Korean soundtrack of Winter Sonata and male and female remakes of 'My Memory'.The <b>outer</b> <b>{{packaging}}</b> (box) is blue while the inner packaging (a booklet w/ photos which holds the CD) is white, which is {{a reversal of the}} first album's colors. Both were released simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s, ABC became {{state-owned}} {{during the}} revolution. Mickey Mouse {{was seen as}} a symbol for worshiping foreign countries, so the packaging was redesigned to feature a naturalistically-drawn White Rabbit and an artist's paint palette with Chinese and English hand-lettering in a color scheme of red, blue and black against a white background. The result was a distinctive candy label design that became instantly recognizable around the world. The packaging and brand logo have changed over the years: When the candies were first marketed, the White Rabbit on the <b>outer</b> <b>packaging</b> was lying down; however, this was changed to an image of the rabbit jumping. Currently, the trade mark animal on the <b>outer</b> <b>packaging</b> has been given enormous neotenic, forward-facing eyes in the style of Disney or Japanese manga, while the inner wrapping retains its classic art deco look and naturalistic rabbit.|$|E
50|$|The album {{packaging}} makes only sparing {{reference to}} either the band or the album title: the <b>outer</b> <b>packaging</b> does not make any reference to Godspeed, but mentions them in the liner notes; the album title is only shown on {{the spine of the}} album cover. The song titles are not listed anywhere on the cover.|$|E
5000|$|Although the {{possibility}} of packing the B ration in units of ten was suggested early in the Second World War, progress on such an arrangement did not begin until 1943 when the Mountain ration, Jungle ration, and 5-in-1 rations were discontinued. The success of the British [...] "compo" [...] or 14-in-1 ration during the North African campaign in 1942 and the movement to classify field rations into four categories added incentive for development of the 10-in-1 ration. [...] A guide to its rapid development was furnished in the following 1943 definition:"A small-group field ration be composed of components of the standard field ration type B (modified to reduce bulk and weight) packed in basic packages of five complete rations each[...] [...] [...] The inner and <b>outer</b> <b>packages</b> are to be proof against water, vapor, moisture, and chemical agents. They are to be of such shape and dimensions as to be suitable for either animal-pack or man-carry, and sufficiently sturdy as to material and construction to withstand normal handling and transportation in motor vehicles, on pack animals or by individual portage." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to protecting the product, packaging {{also play a}} big role marketing cosmetic products. While product quality {{is a major factor}} in the product's success, its packaging must be attractive since that's the essence of beauty marketing. Package design must capture the imagination and be associated with enhancing appearance. One of the keys to attractive packaging is artistic use of colors. Most relevant for the marketer is the <b>outer</b> secondary <b>packaging.</b> However, there are cosmetics which are distributed in one single cosmetic container.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} 2002 DVD {{release was}} packaged as a [...] "special edition". In {{addition to the}} extra features on the disc, the Amaray case came in a foil-embossed cardboard sleeve, and inside was an eight-page booklet, featuring a five-page essay by Robertson entitled [...] "The End of a Musical Journey". Also included was a US$5 rebate coupon for the four-CD box set. In 2005, the DVD was re-issued with different artwork and stripped of the <b>outer</b> foil <b>packaging,</b> inner booklet and coupon; the disc's contents remained unchanged.|$|R

5000|$|One-way kegs, {{also known}} as {{disposable}} kegs or PET kegs, were invented in 1996. They are usually made of plastic. Some types have a cardboard <b>outer</b> <b>packaging,</b> which makes them easier to stack and transport, and also protects the plastic container. Some may use either bag in ball or spear technology. A stronger, more pressure resistant type of one way kegs make use of a double wall technology.|$|E
50|$|It is {{suitable}} for vegans, ovo-vegetarians, for people with PKU or other dangerous diseases, and for those with lactose intolerance or milk allergy, as the bacteria for shop-bought soy yogurt are usually not grown on a dairy base. Due to certain recurring doubts and controversies about the bacterial cultures used, most soy yogurt manufacturers nowadays include certified labels, usually by the Vegan Society or similar vegan organisations, clearly visible on the <b>outer</b> <b>packaging.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on VHS, Betamax and VideoDisc in pan and scan only, and on laserdisc in both pan and scan and widescreen. For its 1999 VHS re-issue, the film was remastered in THX and made available in widescreen. The <b>outer</b> <b>package</b> was retitled Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark for consistency with the film's prequel and sequel. The subsequent DVD release in 2003 features this title as well. The title in the film itself remains unchanged, even in the restored DVD print. In the DVD, two subtle digital revisions were added. First, a connecting rod from the giant boulder to an offscreen guidance track in the opening scene was removed from behind the running Harrison Ford; second, a reflection in the glass partition separating Ford from the cobra in the Well of Souls was removed. Shortly before the theatrical release of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Raiders (along with The Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade) was re-released on DVD with additional extra features not included on the previous set on May 13, 2008. The film {{was released on}} Blu-ray Disc in September 2012. Previously, only Kingdom of the Crystal Skull had been available on Blu-ray.|$|R
40|$|High-temperature hybrids {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} {{to be the most}} reliable packaging method for down-hole circuits which will be subjected to elevated temperatures, thermal cycling and/or high shock and vibration. However, one cannot simply take a standard surface mount circuit and repackage it in hybrid form and expect good results. The circuit designer must consider issues such as die availability and active component functionality at high temperature. Passive components may also need to be changed: considerations include the availability of resistors and capacitors of appropriate physical size in hybrid-compatible packages, component tolerances over the temperature range and the effects of aging on these components. Practical hybrid package size limitations are driven by ceramic processing capabilities, dimensional tolerances, and thermal expansion mismatch between the substrate, the components, and the <b>outer</b> <b>package.</b> Circuit size reductions are not always realized as allowances must be made for package wall thicknesses, I/O pins, clearance between components and clearance for automated wire bond tools. Ten years of continuous hybrid process development and extensive circuit reliability testing has exposed several limitations on assembly reliability. Lessons learned and statistical failure data will be presented [...] Limitations of SMT technology Most down-hole electronics circuits used today are made using surface-mount technology (SMT).
