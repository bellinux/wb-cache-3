5|$|By 1932 the Cronulla tramway had closed. Competing bus {{services}} {{had begun}} to run with unrestricted competition, and the tram line by this time was so full with services that trams often ran late due to holdups at the crossing loops and passengers missed their connections at Sutherland. The line suffered large losses in its later years, {{and the effect of}} the Great Depression at the time forced it to cease its services, the last passenger service operating on 3 August 1931.

Cagney made two films for Grand National: Great Guy and Something to Sing About. He received good reviews for both, but overall the production quality was not up to Warner Bros. standards, and the films did not do well. A third film, Dynamite, was planned, but Grand National ran out of money.|$|E

Owing to the failure of the United States to ratify the Treaty of Versailles, this mission, however, was never carried out.|$|E

5|$|On November 11, 1926, the United States Numbered Highway System was {{approved}} by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO), and US12 was the designation assigned to a highway running northeasterly from Indiana near Lake Michigan to Benton Harbor–St. Joseph and turning east to Detroit through Kalamazoo, Jackson, and Ann Arbor. This designation replaced sections of the original M-11 and M-17 through {{the southern part of the}} state. By the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> the MSHD rerouted the highway between Sawyer and Stevensville, and Downtown Stevensville was bypassed in 1928.

5|$|The bishops took {{possession}} of the castle later in 1271 and promised Llywelyn that building work would temporarily cease and that negotiations would begin the following summer.

Work on the castle continued, with additional water defences, towers and gatehouses added.|$|E

The loss of men was reported as about 200 at the time, but later reports list only 67 fatalities. Amalfi was among the largest ships sunk by U-boats during the war.

Republicans were successful in Maine, and after the Maine elections in September, Blaine went on a speaking tour from Pennsylvania to Tennessee, hoping to boost the prospects of Republican candidates there. Republicans were less successful nationwide, gaining seats in the House while losing seats in the Senate, but Blaine’s speeches kept him and his opinions in the spotlight.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, the MSHD signposted {{the highway}} {{system for the}} first time, and the east–west {{highways}} through Lansing {{were part of the}} original M-29 through downtown and the original M-39 north of downtown.
