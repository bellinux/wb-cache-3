25|$|On screen {{there was}} no mention <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>went</b> on backstage, instead Michaels and Jannetty started to show signs of dissension. During a singles match between Michaels and Ric Flair, Jannetty rolled Shawn into the ring to get pinned. Michaels took this as Jannetty costing him the match instead of helping out (though this was a storyline). At the 1991 Survivor Series Jannetty caused Michaels to be {{eliminated}} by accidentally slamming one of the Nasty Boys into him after which The Rockers argued. After the buildup, The Rockers wrestled one last match on television, a title shot at The Legion of Doom which The Rockers lost after which Jannetty and Michaels argued over who was to blame.|$|E
500|$|The War Within: A Secret White House History (2006–2008) is a non-fiction book by Washington Post {{reporter}} Bob Woodward {{that was}} released by publisher Simon & Schuster on September 8, 2008. It is the fifteenth book written by Woodward, the fourth {{in a series of}} books about President George W. Bush and his administration's foreign policy including Bush at War, Plan of Attack, and State of Denial. The book discusses the debate within the administration about the controversial Iraq [...] "surge" [...] strategy implemented in 2007. Simon & Schuster editor Alice Mayhew said in an official statement that “There has not been such an authoritative and intimate account of presidential decision making since the Nixon tapes and the Pentagon Papers. This is the declassification <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>went</b> on in secret, behind the scenes.” ...|$|E

[...] Tim Skold, formerly of the band Shotgun Messiah, made his first appearance as a band member, writing lyrics and performing vocals on [...] "Anarchy". Looking back on Symbols in 2002, Konietzko said, [...] "I listened to the Symbols album and heard exactly why KMFDM broke up in the first place. It told me the story <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>went</b> wrong. There were maybe two (good) songs on that album and the others were just a bunch of compromising tug-of-wars.

500|$|The present life man, O king, {{seems to}} me, in {{comparison}} with that time which is unknown to us, like to the swift flight of a sparrow through the room wherein you sit at supper in winter amid your officers and ministers, with a good fire in the midst whilst the storms of rain and snow prevail abroad; the sparrow, I say, flying in at one door and immediately out another, whilst he is within is safe from the wintry but after a short space of fair weather he immediately vanishes out of your sight into the dark winter from which he has emerged. So this life of man appears for a short space but <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>went</b> before or what is to follow we are ignorant.

500|$|To this day, Reagan's {{role in the}} {{transactions}} is not definitively known; it is unclear exactly what Reagan knew and when, and whether the arms sales were motivated by his desire to save the U.S. hostages. Oliver North wrote that [...] "Ronald Reagan knew of and approved a great deal <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>went</b> on with both the Iranian initiative and private {{efforts on behalf of}} the contras and he received regular, detailed briefings on both...I have no doubt that he was told about the use of residuals for the Contras, and that he approved it. Enthusiastically." [...] Handwritten notes by Defense Secretary Weinberger indicate that the President was aware of potential hostages transfers with Iran, as well as the sale of Hawk and TOW missiles to what he was told were [...] "moderate elements" [...] within Iran. Notes taken on December 7, 1985, by Weinberger record that Reagan said that [...] "he could answer charges of illegality but he couldn't answer charge [...] that 'big strong President Reagan passed up a chance to free hostages'". The Republican-written [...] "Report of the Congressional Committees Investigating the Iran-Contra Affair" [...] concluded, that There is some question and dispute about precisely the level at which he chose to follow the operation details. There is no doubt, however, ... the President set the US policy towards Nicaragua, with few if any ambiguities, and then left subordinates more or less free to implement it.|$|E
500|$|In 1982 the Cure {{recorded}} and released Pornography, {{the third and}} final album of an [...] "oppressively dispirited" [...] trio that cemented the Cure's stature as purveyors of the emerging gothic rock genre. Smith has said that during the recording of Pornography he was [...] "undergoing a lot of mental stress. But {{it had nothing to do}} with the group, it just had to do with what I was like, my age and things. I think I got to my worst round about Pornography. Looking back and getting other people's opinions <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>went</b> on, I was a pretty monstrous sort of person at that time". Gallup described the album by saying, [...] "Nihilism took over [...] We sang 'It doesn't matter if we all die' and that is exactly what we thought at the time." [...] Parry was concerned that the album did not have a hit song for radio play and instructed Smith and producer Phil Thornalley to polish the track [...] "The Hanging Garden" [...] for release as a single. Despite the concerns about the album's uncommercial sound, Pornography became the band's first UK Top 10 album, charting at number eight. The release of Pornography was followed by the Fourteen Explicit Moments tour, where the band finally dropped the anti-image angle and first adopted their signature look of big, towering hair and smeared lipstick on their faces. The tour also saw a series of incidents that prompted Simon Gallup to leave the Cure at the tour's conclusion. Gallup and Smith did not talk to each other for eighteen months following his departure.|$|E
