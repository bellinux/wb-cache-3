5|$|Brain death {{refers to}} an {{irreversible}} total loss of brain function. This is characterised by coma, loss of reflexes, and apnoea, however, the declaration of brain death varies geographically and is not always accepted. In some countries {{there is also a}} defined syndrome of brainstem death. Declaration of brain death can have profound implications as the declaration, under the principle of medical futility, will be associated with the withdrawal of life support, and as those with brain death often have organs suitable for <b>organ</b> <b>donation.</b> The process is often made more difficult by poor communication with patients' families.|$|E
5|$|Church {{belief in}} {{the resurrection of the}} body led to a {{prohibition}} against cremation that was pastorally modified at the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s under limited circumstances, but those conditions have been largely ignored even by the clergy. According to the Catechism, burial of the dead is a corporal work of mercy that must treat the body with respect and love (e.g. scattering of cremated remains, burial in an unmarked grave, etc. are forbidden in the Catholic Church). <b>Organ</b> <b>donation</b> after death and organ transplants under certain terms, also autopsies for legal and scientific reasons are permitted.|$|E
5|$|Dengue {{can also}} be {{transmitted}} via infected blood products and through <b>organ</b> <b>donation.</b> In countries such as Singapore, where dengue is endemic, the risk {{is estimated to be}} between 1.6 and 6 per 10,000 transfusions. Vertical transmission (from mother to child) during pregnancy or at birth has been reported. Other person-to-person modes of transmission have also been reported, but are very unusual. The genetic variation in dengue viruses is region specific, suggestive that establishment into new territories is relatively infrequent, despite dengue emerging in new regions in recent decades.|$|E

5|$|Payton's legacy {{continues}} through the charitable Walter and Connie Payton Foundation. His own appeals—and after his death, his foundation's—for {{greater awareness of}} the need for organ donations are widely credited with bringing national attention to the problem. After his appeals, donations in Illinois skyrocketed, and the regional organ bank of Illinois was overwhelmed with calls. In response, the City of Chicago inserted <b>organ</b> <b>donation</b> requests into city-vehicle-registration mailings in early 2000, and by August 2000, 13,000 people had signed on to the program. The foundation continues to run a program that Payton organized to donate toys to underprivileged children across the Chicago area each Christmas. The family established the Walter Payton Cancer Fund in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting Holby City origins as a {{spin-off}} from Casualty and the {{closely related}} premises {{of the two}} programmes, the BBC has screened occasional crossover mini-dramas entitled Casualty@Holby City, featuring a number of characters {{from each of the}} two casts. Prior to the commissioning of Casualty@Holby City, the two shows had occasionally crossed-over storylines and cast members before; for instance developing a romance between Holby City Ben Saunders (David Paisley) and Casualty Tony Vincent (Lee Warburton). The first full crossover was spearheaded by Casualty executive producer Mervyn Watson, and Holby City McHale. Logistical difficulties arose from the fact the two series are usually produced 120 miles apart, and work on both shows had to be halted for two weeks to release a number of cast members to appear in the special. A second crossover was commissioned in 2005 as part of the BBC's DoNation season, aiming to raise public awareness of <b>organ</b> <b>donation</b> and help viewers make an informed decision about whether to sign up to the Organ Donor Register. An interactive episode of Casualty@Holby City was one of the headlining shows of the season, allowing viewers to vote by phone to determine the outcome of a fictional <b>organ</b> <b>donation.</b> The third Casualty@Holby City crossover aired in October 2005. The four-part storyline tackled the issue of youth violence, following the events of a turbulent A demonstration at an inner-city school. Based on the success of the 2004 Casualty@Holby City Christmas special, another crossover was ordered for Christmas 2005. Rather than dividing the episodes between the two series' crews as had previously been standard, this crossover operated as an entirely separate production, with Kyle producing and Paul Harrison directing.|$|E
5|$|Chopra is a {{supporter}} of environmental charities and is brand ambassador for NDTV Greenathon, an initiative to support eco-friendliness and provide solar power to rural villages without electricity supplies. She appeared with children in an animated video to support the cause, and removed rubbish from {{the banks of the}} Yamuna river in Agra to increase awareness of environmental issues. During the third and fourth editions of Greenathon, She adopted up to seven villages to provide with a regular supply of electricity. She adopted a tigress in 2011 and a lioness in 2012 at the Birsa biological park, paying for both animals' upkeep for a year. To promote <b>organ</b> <b>donation,</b> Chopra pledged to donate her own organs after death and was co-keynote speaker at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's Bollywood-themed 20th-anniversary celebration of its liver-transplant programme in 2012.|$|E

They were awarded Italy's highest honour for civilians [...] "Medaglia d'Oro al Merito Civile". After Nicholas' death, donation rates increased dramatically in Italy, {{a country where}} <b>organ</b> <b>donations</b> had been among the lowest in Europe.

5|$|Holby City has {{attracted}} comparisons to other medical dramas, often unfavourable, and figures within {{the television and}} entertainment industry including Broadcasting Standards Commission director Paul Bolt have accused the BBC of squandering the television licence fee on the programme. The series employs {{a team of researchers}} to ensure medical accuracy, and utilises surgeons from different disciplines to check scripts. Cast members are taught to perform basic medical procedures, and given the opportunity to spend time on real hospital wards for research. Holby City has, however, been criticised for its lack of realism, with the British Medical Association denouncing its portrayal of <b>organ</b> <b>donation</b> and unrealistic impression of resuscitation, and an accident and emergency nurse at the 2008 Royal College of Nursing conference accusing the show of fostering unrealistic expectations of the NHS and fuelling compensation culture.|$|E
5|$|A second {{victim is}} found, {{this time a}} man whose eyes have been removed by forced surgery. Again, they {{discover}} the eyes were obtained from <b>organ</b> <b>donation,</b> and they find a connection to a woman called Amanda (Anja Savcic), a ballerina who had committed suicide. They also note the care that the culprit performed the work, and speculate that the person {{they are looking for}} is showing some compassion for his victims, calling for emergency help and using the serum to hope that they are given the proper care in time. They find that Amanda's alleged cremated remains are bogus, and that her body had been stolen before it could be cremated. They start to trace connections to Amanda, finding she was in a depression counseling support group. Though there are several possible suspects, Olivia's intuition leads her to a man named Roland David Barrett (Mark Ivanir), who was noted to have become enamored with Amanda at the meetings. At Roland's home, he has recovered the corpse and surgically replaced the organs in her body. Using a makeshift set of ropes and pulleys, Roland engages Amanda's body in a marionette act to make her perform like a ballerina, promising her he will bring her back to life.|$|E

40|$|The acute {{shortage}} of human organs and tissues for transplantation has been attributed {{in part to}} health professionals, including nurses, for their reluctance to recognize and refer suitable candidates for donation. In 1988, nurses' knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding <b>organ</b> and tissue <b>donation</b> and transplantation were assessed using a 70 -item questionnaire. Respondents included 1, 683 nurses employed in 62 rural and urban hospitals in the Midwest. Only 365 respondents (21. 7 percent) reported having requested tissue donations and 243 (14. 4 percent) reported having requested <b>organ</b> <b>donations.</b> However, of those who requested tissue or <b>organ</b> <b>donations,</b> 270 (74 percent) obtained consents for tissues and 150 (61. 7 percent) obtained consent for <b>organ</b> <b>donations.</b> Respondents were knowledgeable about <b>organ</b> and tissue <b>donation</b> (mean score of 7. 5 on a 0 to 10 knowledge scale with 10 as highest) and reported attitudes and beliefs were moderately positive. Factors that were significantly correlated {{with the number of}} requests made for organs and tissues and the number of consents obtained included nurses' knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about donation; nurses' perception of their own {{confidence in their ability to}} request tissues and organs; being a supervisor; and working in an emergency department...|$|R

25|$|Deontological {{issues are}} issues {{about whether a}} person has an ethical duty or {{responsibility}} to take an action. Nearly all scholars and societies around the world agree that voluntarily donating organs to sick people is ethically permissible. Although nearly all scholars encourage <b>organ</b> <b>donation,</b> fewer scholars believe that all people are ethically required to donate their organs after death. Similarly, nearly all religions support voluntary <b>organ</b> <b>donation</b> as a charitable act of great benefit to the community, although a few small groups, like the Roma (gypsies), oppose <b>organ</b> <b>donation</b> on religious grounds. Issues surrounding patient autonomy, living wills, and guardianship make it nearly impossible for involuntary <b>organ</b> <b>donation</b> to occur.|$|E
25|$|Orthodox Judaism {{considers}} <b>organ</b> <b>donation</b> obligatory if it {{will save}} a life, {{as long as the}} donor is considered dead as defined by Jewish law. In both Orthodox Judaism and non-Orthodox Judaism, the majority view holds that <b>organ</b> <b>donation</b> is permitted in the case of irreversible cardiac rhythm cessation. In some cases, rabbinic authorities believe that <b>organ</b> <b>donation</b> may be mandatory, whereas a minority opinion considers any donation of a live organ as forbidden.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the impact of}} default rules on economic behavior. We primarily focus {{on the effect of}} legislation on cadaveric <b>organ</b> <b>donations.</b> We show how the involvement of the family in the decision making process switches the common belief that the opt-out system (donors by default) results in more <b>organ</b> <b>donations</b> than the opt-in system (non-donors by default). Informed consent systems could actually result in more donations than presumed consent.

25|$|The {{indigenous}} population of New Zealand also have strong views regarding <b>organ</b> <b>donation.</b> Many Maori people believe <b>organ</b> <b>donation</b> is morally unacceptable {{due to the}} cultural need for a dead body to remain fully intact. However, because {{there is not a}} universally recognised cultural authority, no one view on <b>organ</b> <b>donation</b> is universally accepted in the Maori population. They are, however, less likely to accept a kidney transplant than other New Zealanders, despite being overrepresented in the population receiving dialysis.|$|E
25|$|Within the European Union, <b>organ</b> <b>donation</b> is {{regulated}} by member states. As of 2010, 24 European countries {{have some form}} of presumed consent (opt-out) system, with the most prominent and limited opt-out systems in Spain, Austria, and Belgium yielding high donor rates. In the United Kingdom <b>organ</b> <b>donation</b> is voluntary and no consent is presumed. Individuals who wish to donate their organs after death can use the <b>Organ</b> <b>Donation</b> Register, a national database. The government of Wales became the first constituent country in the UK to adopt presumed consent in July 2013. The opt-out <b>organ</b> <b>donation</b> scheme in Wales went live on December 1, 2015 and is expected {{to increase the amount of}} donors by 25%. In 2008, the UK discussed whether to switch to an opt-out system in light of the success in other countries and a severe British organ donor shortfall. In Italy if the deceased neither allowed nor refused donation while alive, relatives will pick the decision on his or her behalf despite a 1999 act that provided for a proper opt-out system. In 2008, the European Parliament overwhelmingly voted for an initiative to introduce an EU organ donor card in order to foster <b>organ</b> <b>donation</b> in Europe.|$|E
