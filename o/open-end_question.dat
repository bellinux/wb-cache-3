40|$|This project {{investigated}} the possible causes of and {{solutions to the}} reticence of many Japanese students attending General English courses at the University of Edinburgh Institute for Applied Language Studies (Scotland). It was suspected that students' reticence affected their rate of learning and personal improvement {{as well as the}} general dynamics of the multi-national classes they attended. Information was gathered in extensive guided, <b>open-end</b> <b>question</b> interviews for over 2 years; 19 students were interviewed intensely. Results suggest that certain socio-cultural factors were significant causes of reticence while activities involving an element of duty to others might encourage Japanese learners to speak more openly. Usefulness and coercion were found to be the two main concerns of students. It was also found that many Japanese students themselves did not feel that speaking was a priority, although it di...|$|E
30|$|The single-bound dichotomous choice {{contingent}} valuation questions {{were used in}} the study. Before the CV question was asked, the current conditions, biodiversity as well as the benefits of U Minh Thuong National Park were introduced. Then, we identified some threats of biodiversity loss such as encroachment, disturbance of vegetation, environmental pollution, wildlife hunting, and trade occurring in this area. A hypothetical conservation program was proposed to prevent from biodiversity loss in the national park. Biodiversity will continue to degrade more seriously without this conservation project. The study proposed funding a biodiversity conservation project {{to increase the number of}} plants and animals in U Minh Thuong National Park or at least keep them from declining every year. The conservation fund could then request international organizations to provide the same amount of money or more compared with the contributions of residents. The raised money would be only used for conservation activities in U Minh Thuong National Park (See the section of CV question for more details in the Appendix). The payment vehicle was used as voluntary continuous donation, contributed through a monthly water bill for three years, which could catch the present value of preferences for biodiversity conservation and also prevent potential protests due to compulsory payment like taxes (Rolfe et al., [2000]). Each household was interviewed whether he/she would be willing to contribute the biodiversity conservation fund a certain amount of money every month as surcharge on his/her household water bills for the next three years. The admissible answers were ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Five different bid values of VND 10, 000, VND 35, 000, VND 60, 000, VND 85, 000 and VND 110, 000 were chosen for the study. These values are equivalent to values in US dollarsa of $ 0.47, $ 1.66, $ 2.84, $ 4.21 and $ 5.20, respectively. Each household was randomly interviewed whether he/she would be willing to contribute one of these bid values and answered whether he/she accepted only one bid value. For example, the respondent was asked ‘Would you be willing to pay VND 10, 000 every month for biodiversity conservation program in U Minh Thuong?’ If the answer was ‘yes’, the list of ‘yes’ reasons was then presented. If the response was ‘no’, the list of ‘no’ reasons was then introduced and an <b>open-end</b> <b>question</b> was also asked whether a respondent would like to contribute another lower amount of money to identify the categories of protest zero, valid zero and WTP less bids.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the choice of housing of Asian {{graduate}} students living in off-campus housing and to identify the relationship between present housing satisfaction and housing expenditures. The data were collected from Asian graduate students living in off-campus housing at Oregon State University. Questionnaires designed for the study were mailed to the total population of 226 students. A total of 167 questionnaires were returned and analyzed. Of the 167 students, 138 were males and 29 were females. Ninety six students were single and the remaining 71 students were married, however, only 61 students had their families living in Corvallis. The students came from 13 different countries. From each of the following countries the graduate student group totaled more than 15 students: China, Hong Kong, India, Iran, Korea and Thailand. There were less than 15 students from each of the following countries: Japan, Jordan, Lebanon, Pakistan, Philippines, Turkey and Vietnam. Of the 167 students, 24 percent lived in apartments and 21 percent lived in married student housing. Proportions for the other types of housing were: rooms in private houses with cooking facilities, 18 percent; single family houses converted into apartments, 15 percent; single family houses 10 percent; private off-campus dormitory, four percent; boarding houses, three percent; others were five percent. In answering an <b>open-end</b> <b>question,</b> the students indicated the important reason for selecting their present housing. Fifty-seven of the 167 students gave economy along with another reason for selecting their present housing. However, 38 students indicated cost alone was the important factor. Of the 22 factors considered in selecting their present housing, cost was given the most frequently as a very important factor. About three-fourths of the students were satisfied or somewhat satisfied with their present housing; however, about one-eighth of the students stated that they were dissatisfied or somewhat dissatisfied with their housing. Twenty-two students or 13 percent were neutral about housing satisfaction. The satisfaction categories were weighted on a scale of + 5, + 4, + 3, + 2 and + 1 with the number, + 5, expressing the highest degree of satisfaction. When calculated on this scale, the satisfaction mean was 3. 86, and the standard deviation was 1. 17. Overall housing expenditure was positively correlated with housing satisfaction; however, there were no linear relationship between the housing satisfaction and housing expenditures. All the students were renting their housing. The range for housing expenditures was from 20 to 170 per month. And the median housing cost was 60 per month. Married students with no children paid an average of 96 per month, while single students paid an average of 58 per month. About 80 percent of the students paid less than 100 and the remaining 20 percent of the students paid more than 100 per month for their housing...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} relatives opinions of information, interaction, support, participation and care at a hospice unit. The aim was also to investigate whether there was a difference between women and men. Method: The study is a descriptive quantitative cross-sectional study. A questionnaire with closed and <b>open-end</b> <b>questions</b> was sent out to 66 relatives to patients who had died at the hospice unit. The closed questions were analyzed with SPSS. A content analyze was used for the <b>open-end</b> <b>questions.</b> Results: The most of the relatives were fully pleased with information, interaction, support and care. Relatives were most pleased with the interaction with the staff. Almost half of the relatives had wanted to participate more in the care of the patient and they had wanted more information to be able to participate. The men were more pleased with the information than the women. There were no significant differences in the other questions. Many relatives experienced the hospice unit as good. Conclusion: The study showed that the relatives were pleased with the hospice unit though some relatives were displeased with their participation in the care of the patient. These needs to be improved and further investigation are needed. ...|$|R

In fact, it is attributed to non-progressive disturbances that occur during brain development in fetus or infant. CP disorders may accompany by speech, auditory, visual abnormal-ity, seizure, learning disorder, mental retardation and etc. Due to the variation in disorders and ultimately the needs that {{are made in the}} wake of the diseases, understanding the needs of these patients is essential. Methods: This research was a qualitative study, with phenomenology method and sampling was purposeful. The participants were 17 cerebral palsy people (6 female and 11 male, with aged 15 to 43).

40|$|Water {{education}} {{activities have}} increased {{in the last few}} years in Turkey, but most studies in this field are carried out in the primary education level. However, adults have an important role in the solution of water related environmental problems. When we examine the limited water education activities prepared for adults, we see that these are either informative seminars or conferences in which most participants have passive roles. Therefore, a 25 -hour water education workshop has been given to 22 adults who have primary or further education degrees and work as government officials. In the workshop, the materials, developed as a part of “Water Awareness: Developing educational material for water education” project, were used. Active participation of adults was achieved at the workshop with the activities regarding knowing, understanding and solving water-based problems as well as preserving water sources. The results of the pre-test and post-test of Water Understanding Test, <b>Open-Ended</b> <b>Questions</b> and Water Use Survey showed that the water education workshop (training) has helped the participants learn about the concepts of water, significantly affected the behaviours and attitudes of water use in a positive way and developed significant environmental consciousness; however, permanence level of positive effects were found to be limited...|$|R

Descriptive phenomenology was utilised to investigate the lived experiences of persons who had human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV/ AIDS), describe common elements, themes or patterns of lived experiences of persons with HIV / AIDS, and analyse the meaning of lived experiences of persons with HIV/ AIDS. Twelve Australians, experiencing HIV infection and participating in the community support groups in Perth, volunteered as participants. Two participated in the pilot study. The other ten participants were interviewed individually for the main study. Intensive <b>open-end</b> <b>questions</b> pertaining to the experiences of living with HIV infection were asked during interviews which were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using Colaizzi 2 ̆ 7 s (1978) method of analysis.

30|$|The {{results of}} this study {{indicate}} that the majority of participants perceive shadowing as effective for both listening and speaking skills. Responses in the open-ended questions also support this point. In addition, all the participants agree on the usefulness of feedback, and believe that more shadowing practice will improve speaking/listening skills. However, individual differences were found in how they favor the shadowing materials at fast speed, especially at a speed that their comprehension cannot process appropriately. This implies the following possible improvement in shadowing administration in class. In order to encourage content shadowing, it is important to establish a checking system that allows participants to review the degree of comprehension of the content. The method would vary depending on the level of engagement required from the participants, from as simple a task as a small quiz on the content (e.g. multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, <b>open-end</b> <b>questions,</b> etc.) to translation of the entire script. As for the speed progression, it is the principal reason for the negative attitudes towards shadowing in this study, because of the speed being too fast for certain participants to keep up with. However, it is also true that others perceive the speed to be adequate and positively challenging. In solving this dilemma, it is suggested to create two or even three versions at different speeds to meet the levels of participants’ shadowing proficiency. In doing so, participants’ performance must be closely monitored, and the most appropriate speed could be assigned: for instance, the feedback could include the instruction as to which suggested version of the shadowing material to download for the following week; or it could be self-assigned: students choose depending on level of challenge/frustration.|$|R

By exploring through limited depth interview the attitudinal areas of authority, fear, aspirations for the future, obstacles to be overcome, capabilities, societal ideals and therapy the project attempted: (1) to elicit, from adjudged juvenile delinquents, information different from that usually sought by public societal agencies and (2) to evaluate the depth interview as a means of eliciting such material. Specific criteria were established for choosing fifteen interviewees, selected from three methods of dealing, with juvenile delinquency: probation, institutionalization and parole. Depth interviews were conducted in a laboratory setting with which the respondents were familiarized prior to the interview. <b>Open-end</b> <b>questions</b> allowed latitude for pursuing the boys 2 ̆ 7 spontaneous responses. The degree of observer reliability was based on the use of standardized schedules on which each observer evaluated the responses of each interviewee.

40|$|Background and Aim: Demographic, physical, {{social and}} {{psychological}} factors make breastfeeding and its maintenance complex. Despite extensive breastfeeding promotion programs, no progress has been achieved. As breastfeeding is a phenomenon embedded in culture and folk perceptions, identification of its key determinants is essential when designing policies and implementing programs. Materials and Methods: In this qualitative study, {{data were collected from}} 35 health professionals through a 4 -day group interview using a structured questionnaire (<b>open-end</b> <b>questions).</b> The participants were purposefully recruited from among the health professionals attending a 4 -day breastfeeding promotion workshop. Results: The determinants of breastfeeding were categorized into 2 main domains, namely, peoples perception of breastfeeding phenomenon and approaches employed in its promotion. The former domain was described by beliefs, demographic characteristics, social variables, and indigenous theories, and the later by practice in the cultural and social context, policies, interactions and practical skills. Conclusion: From the participants perspective, misperceptions of people can determine the degree of success or failure of a breastfeeding promotion program. Our findings confirm that peoples perceptions are deeply influenced by their demographic characteristics, folk theories and social variables. As regards the breastfeeding promotion domain, the barriers are social-cultural factors rooted in the local beliefs and folk theories. The participants listed the breastfeeding promotion determinants as lactation policies and health providers performance related to their skill in effective communication with mothers. Our findings also indicate that wrong beliefs, maternal and child diseases, caesarian section, and mothers employment were believed to be deterrents in promoting breastfeeding in the community and that pediatricians, obstetricians and other health professionals can play key roles in the field. Based on our findings, we can further conclude that the phenomenon of breastfeeding and its maintenance are deep-rooted in social structure and cultural diversity. When designing and implementing breastfeeding promotion programs, local variables and determinants should be taken into consideration...|$|R

However, most analyses {{of gender differences}} make broad comparisons, with few studies modeling male and female cycling patterns separately for recreational and transport cycling. This modeling is important, {{in order to improve}} our efforts to promote cycling to women and men in countries like Australia with low rates of transport cycling. The main aim {{of this study was to}} examine gender {{differences in}} cycling patterns and in motivators and constraints to cycling, separately for recreational and transport cycling. Methods Adult members of a Queensland, Australia, community bicycling organization completed an online survey about their cycling patterns; cycling purposes; and personal, social and perceived environmental motivators and constraints (47 % response rate). Closed and <b>open-end</b> <b>questions</b> were completed. Using the quantitative data, multivariable linear, logistic and ordinal regression models were used to examine associations between gender and cycling patterns, motivators and constraints. The qualitative data were thematically analyzed to expand upon the quantitative findings. Results In this sample of 1862 bicyclists, men were more likely than women to cycle for recreation and for transport, and they cycled for longer. Most transport cycling was for commuting, with men more likely than women to commute by bicycle. Men were more likely to cycle on-road, and women off-road. However, most men and women did not prefer to cycle on-road without designed bicycle lanes, and qualitative data indicated a strong preference by men and women for bicycle-only off-road paths. Both genders reported personal factors (health and enjoyment related) as motivators for cycling, although women were more likely to agree that other personal, social and environmental factors were also motivating. The main constraints for both genders and both cycling purposes were perceived environmental factors related to traffic conditions, motorist aggression and safety. Women, however, reported more constraints, and were more likely to report as constraints other environmental factors and personal factors.

40|$|Background Out of the {{different}} fund categories hedge funds have had the highest development in Sweden since 1994. Swedish investors’ interest in hedge funds doubled from 2005 to 2006. Hedge funds {{are said to be}} an investment with a low risk and not being dependent upon business cycle movements. Historically there have been high initial investments, most often over 100 000 SEK, required to invest in hedge funds. This has started to shift towards lower initial investments. This is a reason why hedge funds start to become interesting to private investors and not only to institutional, and wealthy private investors. Purpose The purpose of this thesis is to explore what different investment strategies and sub strategies that are used within Swedish hedge funds. Also specific risks and risk measurements, depending on investment strategy, will be investigated and compared. Method In order to meet the purpose of this thesis a qualitative approach has been used. A questionnaire, with both closed and <b>open-end</b> <b>questions,</b> was sent to 13 hedge fund managers operating in the Swedish hedge fund market. Afterwards, four semi-structured interviews were conducted. Two of the interviewees are hedge fund managers who also answered the questionnaire. The others were with a person who is a hedge fund analyst and a person working at the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (SFSA). Conclusion Out of the five different investment strategies investigated the two most widely used in Swedish hedge funds are funds of hedge funds and equity hedge. The sub strategies that are used within the Swedish hedge fund market are those with a focus on low risk. Within Swedish hedge funds there are some specific risks and risk measurements that are useful. Sharpe ratio is best used to compare similar funds. Standard deviation is useful to evaluate each specific hedge fund. How much leverage capital that can be used is decided by SFSA. Yet, the risks depend on the hedge fund manager rather than the investment strategy used. This, {{due to the fact that}} the hedge fund managers have an own interest in the hedge fund...|$|R

Videogame-based training (VBT) along with virtual reality seems to be beneficial to train upper limb function. ObjectiveTo evaluate the usability of VBT using the Leap Motion Controller (LMC) to train fine manual dexterity in the early rehabilitation phase of stroke patients as an add-on to conventional therapy. Additionally, this study aimed to estimate the feasibility and potential efficacy of the VBT. MethodsDuring 3 [*]months, 64 stroke patients were screened for eligibility, 13 stroke patients were included (4 women and 9 men; age range: 24 – 91 [*]years; mean time post stroke: 28. 2 [*]days). InterventionNine sessions of 30 [*]min VBT, three times per week as an add-on to conventional therapy with stroke inpatients. Outcome measuresPrimary outcome was the usability of the system measured with the System Usability Scale. Secondary outcomes concerning feasibility were the compliance rate calculated from the total time spent on the intervention (TT) compared to planned time, the opinion of participants via <b>open-end</b> <b>questions,</b> {{and the level of}} active participation measured with the Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale. Regarding the potential efficacy secondary outcomes were: functional dexterity measured with the Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT), subjective dexterity measured with the Dexterity Questionnaire 24, grip strength measured with the Jamar dynamometer, and motor impairment of the upper limb measured with the Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity (FM-UE) scale. ResultsPrimarily, the usability of the system was good to excellent. The patient’s perception of usability remained stable over a mean period of 3 [*]weeks of VBT. Secondly, the compliance rate was good, and the level of active participation varied between good and very good. The opinion of the participants revealed that despite individual differences, the overall impression of the therapy and device was good. Patients showed significant improvements in hand dexterity.

A second purpose was to examine both motivations for and barriers to participation in this distance education model. Two surveys (faculty and student) were designed to collect data for this study. Responses from faculty included their perceptions of student performance, student inquiries and participation, administrative and logistical support services, technology (performance and limitations), and program strengths/limitations. Responses from students included their demographic profile, motivations for participation (logistical, personal, and career), perceptions of the program strengths/limitations, faculty, technology, and administrative support services. Responses to all questions were reported by number and percentage. Responses to <b>open-end</b> <b>questions</b> were separated into categories and reported by number. The major findings included: Males (67 %) outnumbered females (32 %) by more than two to one. More students were married (78. 9 %) than single (20. 1 %). Nearly all (96. 1 %) had experienced good TV reception at their site. Many rated issues such as receiving the program in their hometown(s) (71. 1 %) and offering it at convenient times (80. 8 %) as important. Other issues rated as important by participants included: the opportunity to earn an MBA (90. 9 %); the opportunity to upgrade work skills (75. 1 %); and the opportunity to learn more about business concepts (83. 2 %). Analysis of the faculty survey revealed the following: 75100 percent of the MBA/TV students demonstrated understanding and resourcefulness in completing class assignments (78. 9 %); less than fifty percent of the students contributed to the quality of class discussions (78. 9 %); and mail communication with students had either minor problems (solved) or had always gone smoothly (78. 9 %). Additional investigation was needed regarding educational resource and training needs of both students and faculty. Also, attitudes of faculty toward distance learners and administrative dictates requiring televised instruction should be further explored. 3 Department of Educational LeadershipThesis (D.

The technique used for the collection of the data was the interview-schedule with <b>open-end</b> <b>questions</b> administered to selected mothers. A sampling of twenty Anglo and twenty Spanish mothers who had infants under the age of {{two and a half years}} and were registered in Child Health Conferences within metropolitan Denver in the fall of 1959 were the source of data. A total of fifty-one children were represented by both groups interviewed. The data were tallied, categorized into tables, and calculated into percentages. The critical ratio of probability was then computed and compared to the. 05 level of significance statistically. The findings of the study were that: (1) although the ages of the children in both groups were essentially identical, the Spanish mothers were currently breast feeding their children while none of the Anglo mothers were; (2) Anglo mothers permitted their children to nurse for a shorter time while Spanish mothers tended to allow longer and more frequently interrupted nursing periods; (3) the Anglo mothers were less able to anticipate the age their children would initially drink from a cup than were the Spanish mothers; (4) the Anglo mothers started their children on solid food at a much younger age than did the Spanish mothers; (5) more Spanish mothers insist their children eat food they disliked; and (6) the Spanish mothers were more apt to reprimand their two year old children for playing in their food than Anglo mothers...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: No {{research}} has been conducted on the experience of Chinese patients in participating in clinical trials. This information will not only inform policy initiatives but also will achieve a more equitable basis for trial participation. Therefore, this study aims to explore Chinese participants’ view and experience in Western medicine (WM) and Chinese medicine (CM) randomized placebo controlled clinical trials. METHODS: The study was based on a semi-structured questionnaire with both close-end and <b>open-end</b> <b>questions</b> answered by Chinese patients who have participated in either a randomized double-blind placebo clinical trial involving WM (n 100) or CM (n 327); these people comprised the study cohort. RESULTS: Altruism (helping others) was the main motivation for Chinese patients to participate in a clinical trials in WM, while trying Chinese medicine was the main motivation for patients to participate in a CM clinical trial. The majority (60 %) of the participants in either type of clinical trial found that clinical trial did no harm to them. Participants believed that the largest beneficial parties from the in clinical trials were patients themselves (35 %) and the researchers (25 - 29 %) or other patients (22 %). The majority of the patients found the methodologies of both clinical trials acceptable. After participating in clinical trials, around 40 % of patients will “very likely” participate in clinical trials if they are invited in the future. But this trend is more obvious in CM clinical trial patients with more participants (32. 3 %) who answered that they “must agree” to participate again if they are invited to join a clinical trial of CM. Even if no incentives were given, many more patients (75 %) from the CM clinical trial were willing to join the clinical trial, while only (43 %) would do so for the WM clinical trial. CONCLUSION: There are some differences between the motivations for Chinese patients to participate in clinical trials in WM and CM. Present findings may suggest that patients prefer CM clinical trials for alternative choices or alternative development in the health care system in Hong Kong. To improve patient care, more clinical trials of CM should be launched. Clinicians’ experience in clinical trial participation should also be investigated in the future. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Our {{purpose in}} this study is {{investigating}} the opinions of the emergency medicine proficiency students about the rotational programs that are implemented in the emergency clinics in our country. Methods: Conducting a survey to comprise of all the emergency medicine proficiency students working in the medical faculties providing emergency medicine training and the research and educational training hospitals had been planned to be implemented between June 2011 and October 2011. In order to determine the contribution of the rotations to medical education, a visual analogous scale had been used whereas closed-end questions had been used {{in order to determine the}} number of attempts made during the rotations and <b>open-end</b> <b>questions</b> had been implemented in order to determine the insufficiencies in rotation. Results: In our study, 218 (45. 4 %) students working in the research and educational training hospitals and 262 (54. 6 %) students from the faculties of medicine had been used. 480 students had been used in total. 331 (68. 9 %) of the students were male and were in the average age between 31. 2 ± 4. 4. The emergency medicine proficiency students had defined the contribution of the rotational programs to their education as 4. 51 ± 2. 42 in the visual analogous scale and the adequacy of the length of the rotations as 5. 92 ± 2. 80. The rotations which contributed at most to the students educational purposes are the pulmonary diseases, (5. 39 ± 2. 82), the cardiology (5. 18 ± 2. 95), and the neurology (4. 75 ± 2. 78) rotations, respectively. The additional rotational programs demanded by the emergency medicine students are the international emergency medicine clinics (50. 5 %), national emergency medicine clinics (17. 2 %), in thoracic surgery (13. 2 %), in 112 Emergency Services (9. 3 %) and the Ear Nose and Throat Rotations (6. 3 %). 50. 9 % of the participants share the opinion that the efficacy of the rotations should be supervised better. Conclusions: The proficiency students studying in the field of emergency medicine have the opinion that the contribution of the rotations to their education is low and that the rotations are not supervised enough...|$|R
40|$|This {{descriptive}} study, {{adapted from}} Holton and Bates' Learning Transfer System Inventory (LTSI), examined factors that facilitated and/or hindered transfer of learning for participants of a four-day grant writing workshop. The targeted population {{was a group}} of faculty and staff at a Midwest state-supported institution of higher education. The workshops included lecture, group and individual work time, and one-on-one consultation with workshop presenters. Learning focused on developing project ideas, searching for a funding sponsor, and developing the proposal narrative and budget. Multiple workshops were offered between December 2000 and December 2003. The LTSI represents sixteen factors for transfer of learning; these factors were adapted to construct an online survey related to Grantsmanship Workshop content. The survey items reflected the workshop phases and the transfer concepts of each phase: prior to the workshop (learner readiness, supervisor/peer support, motivation to attend, learning interests, pre-workshop preparation); during the workshop (workshop design, time allotment, feedback); and after the workshop ended (content validity, transfer design, personal capacity for transfer, opportunity to use). In addition to these 49 Likert scale items, the survey included yes/no, short answer, and <b>open-end</b> <b>questions</b> related to post-workshop activity, allowing the opportunity to provide additional evidence of their workshop experiences. Of the sixty-six former participants contacted via email, twenty-two voluntarily completed the survey. Issues highlighted during the pre-workshop time period were (1) understanding the significance for learning about grant writing, (2) perception of external support for workshop attendance, and (3) preparation for the workshop. During the workshop, participants acknowledged the benefits of using individual interests to learn the general concepts surrounding grant writing and connecting the learning back to their respective transfer environments. Points of debate were raised regarding program design, particularly with time allocation; responses varied from "not enough individual time" and "too much lecturing" to "too fast-paced" and "not long enough. " Two transfer issues emerged after the workshop: time for completing projects, and departmental- and college-level support for pursuing externally funded projects. Findings from the study were used to recommend strategies for future study, as well to suggest transfer strategies for program planners, instructors, program attendees, and other stakeholders.

40|$|The {{importance}} of service quality {{has been growing}} day by day. The {{studies that have been}} under taken in this field are also increasing periodically. Increasing {{importance of}} service quality has made imperative to find on effective way to measure service quality it. The’ service sector, determining this necessity in the light of "You can not make it better unless you can measure ", it tries to measure service quality in a more effective way. In fact, there has been substantial body of research on this field. Among these studies, the most popular one is Parasuraman, Zeithaml and SERVQUAL model developed by Berry. Reduced-to-one-type-service-features of SERVQUAL, limits its applicability in measuring service quality of libraries. Nitecki and Hernon, making their researches on librarianship sector, used a SERVQUAL-based instrument they formed, to measure quality service in libraries. This thesis adapt the model developed by Nitecki and Hernon and applied it in a university library in Turkey. The questionnaire was prepared and administered to a sample of 470 users and only 237 users were eligible for assessment. The reliability of known factors was tested first and after that the quadrant and difference analysis were applied. In that way, the applicable and non-applicable features for library users were determined. The results gained were presented visually in quadrant analysis and numerically in difference analysis. Considerable differences were found between expectations and perceptions of service quality. Detailed quadrant analysis was made for different user groups of the library. This analysis showed that there are differences of expectations and perceptions between user groups. For SERVQUAL criteria, the results of the previous studies that were obtarwed from similar studies conducted in librarian for librarianship sector before, were compared to our findings. The similar and different points of this comparison were determined.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} factors contributory to success or failure of a microenterprise. Microenterprise is an enterprise with less than 10 employees. About 99 % of all Finnish enterprises fall in this category. Earlier studies do not provide a comprehensive view on microenterprise success and failure factors. The theoretical part discusses the definition of success and failure, previous research and results already established about the topic and categories of business environment. The empirical part is founded on quantitative survey results from 204 Finnish microenterprises. The questions of the survey were based on previous surveys, literature and intuition. Both success and failure factors were enquired. Summary of the results was made and the results were compared among successful and unsuccessful enterprises. In <b>open-end</b> <b>questions,</b> the most important factors mentioned to affect enterprise performance positively were "Employees", "Customers" and "Skills, knowledge, education and experience. " The most important factors affecting enterprise performance negatively were "Economical situation", "Employees availability and attitudes" as well as "Political decisions and passed laws". In Likert-scale set of questions, the most significant factors from the point of view of enterprise performance were "Product and / or service good quality", "Good reputation of the company" and "Staff's strong skills". The least significant factors were "Effect of marketing and promotion", "Conflicts" and "Differences of points of views of different generations". By Likert-scale set of questions, it was also tested which operations the enterprises perform, and according to the results, successful enterprises found "Performing a market research", "Use of distribution channel in sales" and "Expanding to new markets" less important than unsuccessful enterprises. The tests proved that the age of the enterprise correlates with the level of success of the enterprise: The younger the enterprise, the more successful it is. In addition, the results show that if the enterprise is family based, the less successful it is. In addition, there was also slight correlation between success and the level of growth, indicating that higher the level of growth the more successful the enterprise is. From the business environment point of view, the key finding was that internal factors affect more on the success of an enterprise than external factors, and that external factors affect more on the failure of an enterprise than internal factors...|$|R
40|$|A {{great debate}} has been {{occurring}} {{in the field of}} gifted education regarding the validity of the identification procedures. Many scholars have called to change the current criteria that has been used to identify gifted students based on their intellectual abilities. The new trend in the field is calling to adopt comprehensive evaluation procedures that start with screening all students especially at an early age. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of using a Jordanian Arabic version of the Cognitive Abilities Screening Test (CogAT) Form Seven in identifying gifted and talented {{children between the ages of}} five and eight years. This study has three main Procedures: a) the translation of the CogAT test, b) the quantitative producer, which includes the reliability and validity indictors’ extraction, and c) the qualitative producer, which includes the focus group interview to examine the effectiveness of using the Arabic version of CogAT in indentifying gifted students in Jordan. A sample of 280 students was randomly chosen from public and private elementary schools and kindergartens in the city of Amman, the capital city of Jordan, and used teachers 2 ̆ 7 nomination for gifted students. Moreover, six teachers were also randomly chosen to conduct a focus group interview. Those teachers participated in either reviewing the test, administering the test, or nominating gifted children. Teachers attended a focus group discussion, and they were asked to discuss four <b>open-end</b> <b>questions.</b> The results indicated significant and high reliability correlations for the total score of the two-time administration (r =. 927) and highly significant internal consistency reliability correlations where Alpha coefficients were. 941 for the subtest scores and. 962 for the total score and split-half reliability was. 904 for the subtest scores and. 927 for the total score. Furthermore, the content validity results demonstrated unanimous agreement among reviewers (6 experts and 10 teachers) about the translation match of the original test, suitability to Jordanian culture, and extracting and interpreting the results.

Finally, the focus group discussion results indicated strong agreement by teachers of the effectiveness of using the Arabic Jordanian version of CogAT Screening Test. Specifically, teachers expressed their satisfaction about the test items and guidelines. Moreover, they unanimously agreed that the test is appropriate to use in Jordan. Also, many positive comments and feedback were provided by teachers about the ability of this test in identifying young gifted children...|$|R
40|$|How do the high-achieving pupils {{say they}} come to {{understand}} a mathematical concept that is new to them? How can these reports be informed by various psychological learning theories of mathematics? These are the research questions of this study. The {{focus is on the}} metacognitive awareness of ten high-achieving high school pupils of mathematics from Denmark and England. Through qualitative un-structured interviews in smaller groups, I investigate how the pupils talk about their learning of a mathematical concept that is new to them. I focus on the cognitive learning process. To answer the research questions I develop a model for analysis to get an understanding of what the pupils tell. I call this model the “CULTIS model for analysis” where ‘CULTIS’ stands for “Consciousness, Unconsciousness, Language, Tacit, Individual, and Social”. I interpret that these are six themes in which the various learning theories express themselves. I organise the six themes in three “pairs” of what seems to be opposite themes and I use the model as a systematic way to handle the many theories and it is a way to sort the pupils’ statements into areas. Subsequently I discuss the pupils’ explanations in each theme and relate them to the other themes. The choice of having qualitative interviews with <b>open-end</b> <b>questions</b> is mainly owing to a necessity of avoiding a self-fulfilling process if both the method of interview and the method of analysis are strongly influenced by theories. Building on work by others, the study assumes that the pupils are able to talk about their learning. The study confirms this assumption, as it is very clear that the pupils are able to speak of their learning process {{in a way that makes}} sense to them and to the pupils they are interviewed with. They explain their learning in their own words but most of the time it is quite easy to identify some theoretical notions which reflects what the pupils say. A result of the study is that it seems that the pupils each have their own way of learning. However, there are also similarities, particularly if we look at each of the three pairs of themes. Seemingly contradictory theories are furthermore often seen in function within one single pupil. Sometimes it also depends on the branch of mathematics they learn. I do therefore also discuss the concept of complementarity between theories as well as the theoretical possibility of a synthesis. Towards the end of the thesis I also discuss the effect these results may have for teacher education and education policy...|$|R
40|$|The problem The {{purposes}} of this study were (1) to review the history of school-district recall laws in California, (2) to enumerate the legal steps in the recall process, (3) to survey a school district where recall election had taken place, and (4) to present community feelings and effects. Procedure A search was made of all laws and official records pertaining to school trustees 2 ̆ 7 recall elections in California. A questionnaire designed to elicit respondent attitudes and feelings was mailed to all who voted in the school district recall election of December 3 rd, 1970. A preliminary number of questionnaires were mailed first to determine the quality of the questionnaire and responses. Post office boxes were rented in the two most popular communities for a better percentage response. Within two weeks after the complete mailing of questionnaires, 33 percent returns were received. The responses to the twenty questions were then tabulated with explanations of each. The <b>open-end</b> <b>questions,</b> to supplement the overall analysis of the survey, and a map of the school district showing voting precincts, percentage graphs, and other relevant information giving a cross reference to the tabular aspect of the survey were used. Findings Selected findings are: 1. The California State Legislature developed a body of law to remove members of school district trustees by recall. 2. Procedures for initiating a recall movement are set down by state law in both the election and school codes. 3. A few highly motivated, well-organized people can initiate a successful recall election. 4. In a small school district with small populated communities, a word-of-mouth, door-to-door campaign by proponents of a recall, can win an election. This method is considerably more effective than any media. 5. Proponents of a recall movement generally put forth considerably more effort than do opponents. 6. Older people are more interested in School Board of Trustee recall elections than younger people. 7. That after a two-year elapse of a successful recall movement the feelings of discontent and suspicion toward members of the school board are still evident. Conclusions 1. Electors in a newly created city located within an old established school district might be more apt to initiate a recall movement than those of an older town. 2. Any area within a school district voting a very high percentage in favor of the recall can win the recall election. 3. School board members up far recall were not well known by the majority of the electors. 4. Removing members’ f 2 ̆ 7 rorn a school board by recall, where exact reasons were in doubt, has lasting effects in the school district. Recommendations 1. All members of a School Board of Trustees should make themselves and their actions known in the district in order to eliminate the necessity for recall. 2. Issues in a recall movemeny should be completely explained to the voters especially by members up for recall. 3. School-board members should be positively responsive to new land and housing developments within the school district. 4. A non-partial committee, possibly from the State Department of Education, be formed to recommend steps that might be taken by a community and school district to eliminate the necessity of a recall election. 5. Leaders of all communities should be encouraged to attend school-board meetings regularly to recognize school problems as they develop and search for means of solutions. Critique Research information on this subject is limited. However, this dissertation points out that recall of School Board of trustees in California is of importance. Because a community can initiate recalls, changes within a school district may take such a form that could drastically reshape the whole school program...|$|R

Nossa base teÃrica fundamentou-se nos estudos de Alliende e Condemarin (2005), Brown (1980), Haberlandt (1988), Kintsch (1994),Van Dijk e Kintsch (1978), Rumelhart (1985), Silva (2005), Singer (1988), Smith (1989, 1999), SolÃ (1998), Spiro (1980), Van Dijk (1996), Kato (2004), Koch (2006 a, 2006 b) e Marcuschi (2008). A pesquisa foi realizada em duas etapas assim definidas: simulado e prova subjetiva. Para o simulado foram escolhidas dez questÃes das provas do ENEM entre 1998,ano de implantaÃÃo do exame, e 2007, que abordavam o conteÃdo de LÃngua Portuguesa e apresentavam como situaÃÃes-problema textos de gÃneros variados. A finalidade do simulado foi selecionar questÃes de nÃveis de dificuldade variados. Os resultados obtidos no simulado possibilitaram a elaboraÃÃo da prova subjetiva composta por quatro questÃes, assim discriminadas: 1 (uma) questÃo com o maior percentual de acertos no simulado, 1 (uma) questÃo com o menor percentual de acerto no Simulado e 2 (duas) questÃes com percentual de acerto mÃdio. Na prova subjetiva elaboramos perguntas com a finalidade de identificarmos a correlaÃÃo entre a compreensÃo leitora das situaÃÃes problemas e a resoluÃÃo das questÃes de LÃngua Portuguesa no ENEM, a partir da produÃÃo de inferÃncias e da identificaÃÃo do propÃsito dos enunciados das questÃes de LÃngua Portuguesa do ENEM. A anÃlise dos resultados obtidos na prova subjetiva evidenciou que nem sempre a compreensÃo da situaÃÃoproblema â o texto â que se apresenta na questÃo assegurou a identificaÃÃo do que estÃ sendo inquirido no enunciado, apesar de os alunos terem produzido inferÃncias necessÃrias Ã compreensÃo leitora. TambÃm foi constatado que, por vezes, os alunos nÃo conseguiram estabelecer uma relaÃÃo lÃgica de sentido entre o texto (situaÃÃo-problema), o enunciado e as opÃÃes. A este fato, destacamos a maneira como a questÃo Ã apresentada e o enfoque que se faz do texto (situaÃÃo-problema) para a relaÃÃo de coerÃncia com o enunciado, o tipo de abordagem e as opÃÃes de resposta, ou seja, a prÃpria estrutura da questÃo. The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{evaluate}} the comprehension of texts which contextualize questions on the âNational High School Examâ (Exame Nacional do Ensino MÃdio â ENEM). The answers to the questions in this exam are, therefore, highly dependent on studentsâ reading skills. The study is theoretically grounded on the works of: de Alliende e Condemarin (2005), Brown (1980), Haberlandt (1988), Kintsch (1994), Van Dijk e Kintsch (1978), Rumelhart (1985), Silva (2005), Singer (1988), Smith (1989, 1999), SolÃ (1998), Spiro (1980), Van Dijk (1996), Kato (2004), Koch (2006 a, 2006 b) e Marcuschi (2008). The research was conducted in two parts: Practice Test and <b>Open-Ended</b> <b>Questions.</b> Ten multiplechoice questions from previous tests of the National Exam (from 1998 to 2005) were chosen for the Practice Test. The choice of the questions was based on two criteria: questions which dealt with Portuguese content and which used texts of different genres for contextualization. The goal of the Practice Test was to select questions of different difficulty levels to use for the Open-ended Questions. Based on the results of the Practice Test four questions were chosen for the Open-ended Questions: 01 (one) question with the highest scores in the Practice Test, 01 (one) question with the lowest scores, and 02 (two) questions with medium percentage of scores. The Open-ended questions were elaborated so as to allow for the identification of the correlation between the Reading comprehension; Inferences; Contextualized questions; National High School Exam (ENEM). based on the inferences made and on the identification of the purpose of the questions. The analysis of the results obtained for the Open-ended Questions demonstrated that the comprehension of the contextualizing texts is not always enough to guarantee the understanding of what is being asked in the question or the answering of the question, even when students make appropriate inferences and are able to establish logical relationships between the texts and the questions. Other factors such as the form and structure of questions and the degree of coherence among the text, the instructions to the question and the question itself also affect question responses...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe and examine selected factors associated with the illness experience and psychosocial adjustment of African American women with breast cancer using an attributional framework. The existence of the phenomena of both delay in seeking treatment and worry was examined. The attributions African American women developed for breast cancer and breast symptoms were identified. ^ Sixty African American women were given several standardized scales and test during a brief interview. Instruments included: The Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale (PAIS), <b>Open-End</b> Attribution <b>Questions</b> about breast cancer and initial symptoms, the worry subscale of the Ware Health Perception Questionnaire, and a Demographic and Illness Related Information Sheet which included information regarding delay in seeking treatment, initial symptoms, knowledge of cancer symptoms through previous experience with family members and friends, and the Global Adjustment to Illness Scale (GAIS). Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to identify and examine differences and relationships among attributions, worry, delay and adjustment to breast cancer. ^ Contrary to the literature, the findings from this study demonstrated a short symptom duration (patient delay) as well as a short provider delay. The sample was also relatively well adjusted psychologically as indicated by scores on the PAIS and the GAIS. Although worry appears to be associated with delay, the predictor of who is deterred by worry and who is motivated to seek treatment remains unknown. ^ Causal thinking, in particular asking Why me? 2 ̆ 2 about the breast cancer appeared to stimulate worry about the diagnosis as well as to increase the interval in obtaining a diagnosis. Knowledge of cancer through a previous experience with a friend or family member appeared to influence the decision to seek treatment such that those with previous experience had a shorter symptom duration and provider delay. The data suggest that further research is needed in exploring the meaning of worry and the contextual factors involved in early helpseeking and delay behavior for African American women. ...|$|R

At the same time, exposing the cooperative to higher financial risks indicate that the member interests are being replaced for other priority interests. Once the members do no have incentives to involve in cooperative governance due to their small investment correlation to the total capital base of the cooperative, they no longer consider themselves as real owners and consequently the free rider problem emerge. When the member perceived that benefits could also arrive from borrowed money and other capital sources instead of their own investing money, a decrease of their contribution as well as their less involvement in participate the governance of cooperative will occur. Inspried by the importance of member commitment and the great potentials of debt capitals, our prime focus of this study is whether the acquisition of debt capital has some influences on member commitment in agricultural cooperatives. The empirical approach consisted of the theorical framework of the social capial theory, the property right theory and the agency theory. The data gathered from the phone interviews with seven representative managers of Chinese agricultural cooperatives and are used to test the hypotheses in which correspond to the aim. Debt capital’s effects on member commitment are measured by five indicators consisted of members’ willingness to invest, level of member control, superiority of members’ interests, members’ benefit from their cooperatives and level of social capital.
