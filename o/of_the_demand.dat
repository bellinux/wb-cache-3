5|$|According to the {{economic}} theory behind congestion pricing, {{the objective of this}} policy is the use of the price mechanism to make users more aware of the costs that they impose upon one another when consuming during the peak demand, and that they should pay for the additional congestion they create, thus encouraging the redistribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> in space or in time, or shifting it to the consumption of a substitute public good; for example, switching from private transport to public transport.|$|E

Following the Great Reform Act of 1832, the newly created Manchester parliamentary borough elected its first two MPs. Five candidates including William Cobbett stood, and the Whigs, Charles Poulett Thomson and Mark Philips, were elected. Manchester became a Municipal Borough in 1837, and what remained of the manorial rights were purchased by the borough council.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 18th century, Britain, and later {{continental}} Europe and the United States, experienced the Industrial Revolution. This was the first time during which production rates exceeded those of Rome. Britain was the leading producer, losing this status by the mid-19th century with the depletion of its mines and the development of lead mining in Germany, Spain, and the United States. By 1900, the United States was the leader in global lead production, and other non-European nations—Canada, Mexico, and Australia—had begun significant production; production outside Europe exceeded that within. A great share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> for lead came from plumbing and painting—lead paints were in regular use. At this time, more (working class) people were exposed to the metal and lead poisoning cases escalated. This led to research into the effects of lead intake. Lead was proven to be more dangerous in its fume form than as a solid metal. Lead poisoning and gout were linked; British physician Alfred Baring Garrod noted a third of his gout patients were plumbers and painters. The effects of chronic ingestion of lead, including mental disorders, were also studied in the 19th century. The first laws aimed at decreasing lead poisoning in factories were enacted during the 1870s and 1880s in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Prized for its {{meat and}} fins, the {{porbeagle}} {{has long been}} under heavy fishing pressure. The meat is sold fresh, frozen, or dried and salted, and ranks among the most valuable of any shark: in 1997 and 1998 it had a wholesale price of EUR 5–7/kg, four {{times that of the}} blue shark (Prionace glauca). Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> comes from Europe, though the United States and Japan also import this species. The fins are shipped to East Asia for use in shark fin soup. The remainder of the shark may also be utilized, for production of leather, liver oil, and fishmeal. International trade in the porbeagle appears to be significant, but remains unquantified as shark products tend not to be reported to the species level, and many consist of a mix of various species. This shark is caught most readily on longlines, but is also susceptible to gillnets, driftnets, trawls, and handlines. It is valuable enough to be generally retained when caught as bycatch; if storage space cannot be spared it may be finned and the carcass discarded.|$|E

5|$|The {{generation}} of economists that followed Keynes synthesized his theory with neoclassical microeconomics {{to form the}} neoclassical synthesis. Although Keynesian theory originally omitted an explanation of price levels and inflation, later Keynesians adopted the Phillips curve to model price-level changes. Some Keynesians opposed the synthesis method of combining Keynes's theory with an equilibrium system and advocated disequilibrium models instead. Monetarists, led by Milton Friedman, adopted some Keynesian ideas, such as the importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> for money, but argued that Keynesians ignored the role of money supply in inflation. Robert Lucas and other new classical macroeconomists criticized Keynesian models that did not work under rational expectations. Lucas also argued that Keynesian empirical models {{would not be as}} stable as models based on microeconomic foundations.|$|E
5|$|When World War II started, tonnage {{levels at}} the port {{decreased}} and shipping activities were suspended; however, the war did provide economic benefits for the city. Petrochemical refineries and manufacturing plants were constructed along the ship channel because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> for petroleum and synthetic rubber products by the defense industry during the war. Ellington Field, initially built during World War I, was revitalized as an advanced training center for bombardiers and navigators. The Brown Shipbuilding Company was founded in 1942 to build ships for the U.S. Navy during World War II. Due to the boom in defense jobs, thousands of new workers migrated to the city, both blacks and whites competing for the higher-paying jobs. President Roosevelt had established a policy of nondiscrimination for defense contractors, and blacks gained some opportunities, especially in shipbuilding, although not without resistance from whites and increasing social tensions that erupted into occasional violence. Economic gains of blacks who entered defense industries continued in the postwar years.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} much of {{monetary}} policy {{was influenced by}} an economic theory known as monetarism.

40|$|Abstract — We {{introduce}} a dynamic {{vehicle routing problem}} in which demands arrive uniformly on a segment and via a temporal Poisson process. Upon arrival, <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> translate perpendicular to the segment in a given direction and with a fixed speed. A service vehicle, with speed greater than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands,</b> seeks to serve these translating <b>demands.</b> For <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> any stabilizing policy, we determine a necessary condition on <b>the</b> arrival rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> problem parameters: (i) the speed ratio between <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> and service vehicle, and (ii) <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> segment on which demands arrive. Next, we propose a novel policy for the vehicle that involves servicing <b>the</b> outstanding <b>demands</b> as per a translational minimum Hamiltonian path (TMHP) through <b>the</b> moving <b>demands.</b> We derive a sufficient condition on <b>the</b> arrival rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> for stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TMHP-based policy, in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> problem parameters.
