5|$|The lack of armour <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> {{the design}} sparked controversy: after the former Chief Constructor of the Royal Navy Edward James Reed visited the ships under construction, he criticized this {{particular}} design feature, arguing that {{in case of}} damage to either end the entering water would have compromised the stability; the new Italian Minister of the Navy, Simone Pacoret di Saint-Bon, replied during a Parliament session that such an event was very unlikely, as it could happen only if all the bulkeads of the watertight compartments were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Vrbanja Bridge was {{an armed}} {{confrontation}} which occurred on 27 May 1995 between United Nations (UN) peacekeepers from the French Army and {{elements of the}} Bosnian Serb Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). It occurred after the VRS seized French-manned United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) observation posts <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the Vrbanja Bridge crossing of the Miljacka river in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Bosnian War. Upon seizing the bridge, the VRS took the French peacekeepers hostage. A platoon of 30 French peacekeepers subsequently re-captured the bridge {{with the support of}} 70 French infantrymen and direct fire from armoured vehicles, in an action which saw the first French Army bayonet charge since the Korean War. During the French assault, elements of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) opened fire on the VRS-held observation posts, accidentally wounding one French hostage.|$|E

The first claim is that qualifying an argument as being visual amounts to a category mistake; the second claim is that past analyses of visual arguments fault <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the “production line” in that the input is not visual and the output is not an argument. Based on the developed critique, I discuss how the study of images in communicative events {{can be carried out}} without the concept of “visual argument” and I illustrate this with two new directions of interdisciplinary research...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficiency}} and sample capacity of conical liquid chromatographic columns with 10 degrees opening angle were studied at different ratio of cross section areas of inlet to outlet (A(in) /A(out)) and column dimension. As the A(in) /A(out) ratio changed from 4 to 2. 25, the reduced plate height (h) was reduced and the h value decreased 12 % when the column dimension was scaled up proportionally because of relatively smaller dead volume <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the column. Compared to cylindrical columns having corresponding lengths and volumes, the conical columns with 10 degrees opening angle were superior in column efficiency, resolution and the maximum peak concentration at column outlet; the loadability of conical column was improved 30 - 40 % on injection volume and 50 - 60 % on sample mass, respectively, over cylindrical columns.

25|$|Using {{his newly}} {{developed}} electromagnetic principle, Henry in 1831 created {{one of the}} first machines to use electromagnetism for motion. This was the earliest ancestor of modern DC motor. It did not make use of rotating motion, but was merely an electromagnet perched on a pole, rocking back and forth. The rocking motion was caused by one of the two leads <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the magnet rocker touching one of the two battery cells, causing a polarity change, and rocking the opposite direction until the other two leads hit the other battery.|$|E
25|$|A key {{advantage}} of every film capacitor's internal construction is direct contact to the electrodes <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the winding. This contact keeps all current paths very short. The design behaves {{like a large}} number of individual capacitors connected in parallel, thus reducing the internal ohmic losses (ESR) and ESL. The inherent geometry of film capacitor structure results in low ohmic losses and a low parasitic inductance, which makes them suitable for applications with high surge currents (snubbers) and for AC power applications, or for applications at higher frequencies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{single crystal}} Ni-Mn-Ga and Ni-Mn-Ga {{particulate}} composites {{have responded to}} mechanical stress up to 1 kHz frequencies with significant acoustic attenuation. It has been observed that in Ni-Mn-Ga polymer composites, a heavy static load <b>on</b> <b>both</b> the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the system increases the acoustic stress amplitude and appears to have acoustic loss drops. The attenuation, {{as a function of}} frequency shows resonances in the displacement of the vibrating particle indicating the twin boundary motions.

In this work, the neutral diuranium molecule was encapsulated into the C 90 fullerene. The neutral U-U dissociation potential energy surfaces of different electronic states confined in the C 90 fullerene were scanned and the quintuple and the septuplet of these states were found to be low-lying. In the fullerene cage, the U 2 molecule easily disintegrates along the axis of the fullerene, and then is chemically adsorbed <b>on</b> the <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the fullerene.

25|$|The {{stalemate}} {{was broken}} {{by the arrival of}} the Union brigade under Brig. Gen. George A. Custer. His attack flanked the Confederates <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the line. As Butler's men fled to the rear, his reserve regiment, the 7th South Carolina, counterattacked in an attempt to maintain the line. The superior Union numbers and firepower—the Michiganders were armed with Spencer repeating rifles—carried the day. The Union troopers pursued the retreating Confederates with enthusiasm. Butler eventually rallied his men at Old Cold Harbor and Torbert's men bivouacked about 1.5 miles northeast of the intersection.|$|E
25|$|That morning, Confederate General Robert E. Lee ordered attacks <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the Union line. Lt. Gen.

Ewell and the Second Corps were assigned {{the mission of}} launching a simultaneous demonstration against the Union right, a minor attack that was intended to distract and pin down the Union defenders against Longstreet. Ewell was to exploit any success his demonstration might achieve by following up with a full-scale attack at his discretion.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the boiling}} point for aqueous {{ethylene}} glycol increases monotonically with increasing ethylene-glycol fraction. Thus, the use of ethylene glycol not only depresses the freezing point, but also elevates {{the boiling point}} such that the operating range for the heat-transfer fluid is broadened <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the temperature scale. The increase in boiling temperature is due to pure ethylene glycol having a much higher boiling point and lower vapor pressure than pure water; there is no chemical stabilization against boiling of the liquid phase at intermediate compositions, as there is against freezing.|$|E
50|$|A {{rotary phase}} {{converter}} is a three-phase motor with special starting arrangements and {{power factor correction}} that produces balanced three-phase voltages. When properly designed, these rotary converters can allow satisfactory operation of a three-phase motor on a single-phase source. In such a device, the energy storage is performed by the inertia (flywheel effect) of the rotating components. An external flywheel is sometimes found <b>on</b> one or <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the shaft.|$|R

25|$|The {{buildings}} on London Bridge were a major fire hazard {{and increased the}} load on its arches, several of {{which had to be}} rebuilt over the centuries. In 1212, perhaps the greatest of the early fires of London broke out <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the bridge simultaneously, trapping many people in the middle. Houses on the bridge were burnt during Wat Tyler's Peasants' Revolt in 1381 and during Jack Cade's rebellion in 1450. A major fire of 1633 that destroyed the northern third of the bridge formed a firebreak that prevented further damage to the bridge during the Great Fire of London (1666).|$|E
