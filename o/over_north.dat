5|$|His 259total combat {{missions}} included 107 in World War II and 152 in Southeast Asia, 105 {{of those}} <b>over</b> <b>North</b> Vietnam. Scat XXVII (F-4C-24-MC 64-0829) was retired from operational service {{and placed on}} display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.|$|E
25|$|Weather {{conditions}} {{during the}} months leading up to the blizzard allowed the blizzard to have the impacts it did. A high-amplitude planetary wave pattern set up, which was very persistent from October 1976 through January 1977, and involved a ridge <b>over</b> western <b>North</b> America and a trough <b>over</b> eastern <b>North</b> America. In January 1977, this pattern persisted, with the pressure of the strong ridge <b>over</b> western <b>North</b> America being more than two standard deviations from the mean, while the strong trough centered <b>over</b> eastern <b>North</b> America was more than three standard deviations from the mean.|$|R
50|$|It will be {{completely}} visible <b>over</b> most of <b>North</b> and South America, seen rising <b>over</b> Northwest <b>North</b> America, and the Pacific Ocean, and setting over Africa, and Europe.|$|R
50|$|The Pacific-North American teleconnection pattern (PNA) is a climatological {{term for}} a {{large-scale}} weather pattern with two modes, denoted positive and negative, and which relates the atmospheric circulation pattern <b>over</b> the <b>North</b> Pacific Ocean with the one <b>over</b> the <b>North</b> American continent.|$|R
5|$|A large {{population}} spreads across the Hawaiian Islands every winter, {{ranging from the}} island of Hawaii {{in the south to}} Kure Atoll in the north. These animals feed in areas ranging from the coast of California to the Bering Sea. Humpbacks were first observed in Hawaiian waters in the mid-19th century and might have gained a dominance <b>over</b> <b>North</b> Pacific right whales, as the right whales were hunted to near-extinction.|$|E
5|$|After it {{merged with}} the system, the storm moved inland over Arkansas, Tennessee and the Ohio Valley. While moving inland, Matthew spun off another low {{pressure}} system that formed <b>over</b> <b>North</b> Carolina on October 13. The low moved off the Mid-Atlantic coast before hitting Massachusetts two days later, and later {{merged with the}} original low pressure system of Matthew.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{tropical}} cyclones {{that become}} extratropical quickly dissipate or are absorbed by another weather system, {{they can still}} retain winds of hurricane or gale force. In 1954, Hurricane Hazel became extratropical <b>over</b> <b>North</b> Carolina as a strong Category 3 storm. The Columbus Day Storm of 1962, which evolved from the remains of Typhoon Freda, caused heavy damage in Oregon and Washington, with widespread damage equivalent to at least a Category 3. In 2005, Hurricane Wilma began to lose tropical characteristics while still sporting Category 3-force winds (and became fully extratropical as a Category 1 storm).|$|E
50|$|Joining Newtown, Kirk {{became the}} first player to kick 100 goals in a season in 1943, {{including}} five in the 34-7 win <b>over</b> <b>Norths</b> in the premiership decider. He was the season's leading point scorer on five occasions, the last in 1946.|$|R

5|$|Crombie was {{transferred}} to the Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre and posted to No. 89 Squadron RAF in October 1941, operating over Egypt and Malta. Also flying Beaufighters, Crombie piloted his first foray with the unit on 21 October, {{and by the end of}} the year had been accredited with the destruction of six Axis aircraft, with an additional two probables. Throughout 1942, the squadron continued to operate <b>over</b> <b>North</b> Africa and the Middle East, with Crombie adding three more aircraft to his tally.|$|E
5|$|Despite missing {{much of the}} {{qualifying}} {{campaign with}} a shoulder injury, Solo {{was named to the}} U.S. roster for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup in Germany. After keeping clean sheets in group C wins <b>over</b> <b>North</b> Korea and Colombia, Solo conceded two goals in the 2–1 loss to Sweden which consigned the Americans to second place in the group and a quarterfinal meeting with Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{cancellation}} of the programme in 1982, the Senior Prom remained highly classified into the 21st century. There are rumours that {{a small number of}} Senior Prom aircraft, configured for aerial reconnaissance, were acquired by the United States Air Force, and were used in secret missions over Eastern Europe late in the Cold War, over Iraq during Operation Desert Storm, and <b>over</b> <b>North</b> Korea; there is no official confirmation of this being the case.|$|E

50|$|Prior to {{the ill-fated}} Northern Eagles joint venture from 2000 to 2002, the rivalry between Manly and {{foundation}} club Norths was arguably one of rugby league's most harsh. Manly had a superior overall head-to-head record <b>over</b> <b>Norths</b> having won 73 of their 123 games compared to just 47 for Norths with 3 draws.|$|R

5|$|Due {{to combat}} and {{operational}} circumstances, 506 U.S. Air Force, 397 Navy, and 19 Marine Corps aircraft were lost over or near North Vietnam. During the operation, of the 745 crewmen shot down, the U.S. Air Force recorded 145 rescued, 255 killed, 222 captured (23 of whom died in captivity), and 123 missing. Figures on U.S. Navy and Marine Corps casualties were harder to come by. During the 44-month time frame, 454 naval aviators were killed, captured, or missing during combined operations <b>over</b> <b>North</b> Vietnam and Laos.|$|E
5|$|Electronic {{tactical}} {{air navigation}} (TACAN) became an absolute necessity in Laos, where mountain peaks and unexpected inclement weather made flying extremely hazardous, especially for older aircraft. This problem was solved by establishing unmanned Air Force stations that broadcast continuous radio transmissions, allowing aerial navigation from fixed geographic reference points. The Air Force also emplaced TSQ-81 radar {{sites in the}} north and northeast to direct Rolling Thunder missions <b>over</b> <b>North</b> Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|For the U.S. Air Force, {{this success}} was {{achieved}} by conducting a shoestring operation, one that was fourth in priority for American air assets behind operations in South Vietnam, Operation Rolling Thunder, and Steel Tiger. After the close-out of aerial operations <b>over</b> <b>North</b> Vietnam, Barrel Roll still remained in last place. During its existence the campaign had utilized an average of only {{ten percent of the}} Air Force's tactical air effort in Southeast Asia. During the 1972 Nguyen Hue PAVN offensive, the number of airstrikes over northern Laos was reduced to only five percent of the total.|$|E

5|$|He {{was awarded}} a fourth Silver Star for leading a three-aircraft {{low-level}} bombing strike on March 30, 1967, and the Air Force Cross for {{an attack on the}} Paul Doumer Bridge in Hanoi on August 11, one of five awarded to Air Force pilots for that mission. He flew his final combat mission <b>over</b> <b>North</b> Vietnam on September 23, 1967.|$|E
5|$|However, {{over the}} Northern Hemisphere land areas where urban heat islands are most apparent, both the trends of lower-tropospheric {{temperature}} and surface air temperature show no significant differences. In fact, the lower-tropospheric temperatures warm at a slightly greater rate <b>over</b> <b>North</b> America (about 0.28°C/decade using satellite data) {{than do the}} surface temperatures (0.27°C/decade), although again the difference is not statistically significant.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Bob Ward {{returned}} to his alma mater to take the head coaching position. Before the season, 12 players failed to academically qualify {{to play on the}} team. During that first season, the team lost all nine of their games {{for the first time in}} the modern era. Ward's second year saw slight improvement, recording eight losses but with wins <b>over</b> <b>North</b> Carolina and South Carolina. However, many of his players were growing increasingly disgruntled with his coaching style.|$|E

50|$|Several {{methods have}} been {{proposed}} to remove the global trend and ENSO influence <b>over</b> the <b>North</b> Atlantic SST. Trenberth and Shea, assuming {{that the effect of}} global forcing <b>over</b> the <b>North</b> Atlantic is similar to the global ocean, subtracted the global (60°N-60°S) mean SST from the North Atlantic SST to derive a revised AMO index.|$|R
5|$|In April 2008, Grant {{transferred}} to the University of Miami. He sat out the 2008–09 season due to NCAA transfer rules. His debut for Miami was in an 83–53 win <b>over</b> <b>North</b> Carolina Central, scoring 6 points, grabbing 4 rebounds and dishing 3 assists in 24 minutes. His season-high scoring effort was 18 points against UNC Wilmington, a feature he tied against Boston College. He played in all 33 games of the season, starting 4 of them, and led the team in assists, with 117. Throughout the season Grant had 9.6 points, 1.9 rebounds and 3.6 assists per game.|$|E
5|$|In Week 9, after {{defeating}} Wake Forest {{to improve}} to a 6–1 record, Maryland was ranked 25th {{by both the}} Associated Press and the Coaches' Polls. It {{was the first time}} the team was ranked since Week 11 in 2006. Maryland would rise in the polls, and enter the Harris and BCS rankings after beating NC State the following week. However, after the loss to Virginia Tech, the Terps fell out of the rankings altogether. Maryland made one final poll appearance after the win <b>over</b> <b>North</b> Carolina, before losing to Florida State.|$|E
5|$|In the Vietnam War, Blanchard flew 113 {{missions}} from Thailand, 84 of them <b>over</b> <b>North</b> Vietnam. He piloted a fighter-bomber {{during a}} one-year {{tour of duty}} that ended in January 1969. He retired from the Air Force in 1971 as a colonel. After retiring from the Air Force, he spent several more years as the commandant of cadets at the New Mexico Military Institute, a junior college that prepares students to enter the service academies.|$|E
