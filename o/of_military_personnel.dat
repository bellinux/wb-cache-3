5|$|Fremantle Prison was {{partially}} {{used as a}} military prison during both world wars – for the detention <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>personnel,</b> {{as well as an}} internment centre. From 1940 until 1946, it was one of more than 50 military prisons across Australia holding a combined total of more than 12,000 enemy aliens and prisoners of war. Fremantle accommodated up to 400 military prisoners and up to 160 civilian prisoners by October 1945. The World War II takeover necessitated the commissioning of Barton's Mill Prison in 1942.|$|E
5|$|In June 1944, the Manhattan Project {{employed}} some 129,000 workers, of whom 84,500 were construction workers, 40,500 were plant {{operators and}} 1,800 were military personnel. As construction activity fell off, the workforce declined to 100,000 a year later, {{but the number}} <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>personnel</b> increased to 5,600. Procuring the required numbers of workers, especially highly skilled workers, in competition with other vital wartime programs proved very difficult. In 1943, Groves obtained a special temporary priority for labor from the War Manpower Commission. In March 1944, both the War Production Board and the War Manpower Commission gave the project their highest priority.|$|E

5|$|The {{administration}} of Cristina Kirchner continued the trials <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>personnel</b> {{involved in the}} Dirty War, started by her husband. There {{have been more than}} 500 people sentenced, and 1,000 convicted, in a process that was unprecedented in Latin America. De facto president Jorge Rafael Videla, who was convicted and given a life sentence in 1985 and pardoned years later, received a new life sentence in 2010. General Luciano Benjamín Menéndez, who waged war against the leftist guerrillas in the northern Argentine provinces, received a life sentence as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{ending of}} his novel had brought Achebe to the {{attention}} <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>personnel,</b> who suspected him of having foreknowledge of the coup. When he received word of the pursuit, he sent his wife (who was pregnant) and children on a squalid boat {{through a series of}} unseen creeks to the Igbo stronghold of Port Harcourt. They arrived safely, but Christie suffered a miscarriage at the journey's end. Chinua rejoined them soon afterwards in Ogidi. These cities were safe from military incursion because they were in the southeast, part of the region which would later secede.|$|E
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in 1914, competitive rugby matches were suspended. Despite this, Edgar Mobbs, the captain of the Barbarians invitation side, organised a match against the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) on 10 April 1915. The Barbarians team on that day was made up <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>personnel,</b> including Dingle, who contributed a try towards a 10–3 victory. Of Dingle's team-mates on that day, both Mobbs and another England international Billy Geen, would also die in action during the war.|$|E

5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in 1914, competitive rugby union matches were suspended. Despite this, Edgar Mobbs organised two Barbarians matches against Leicester in early 1915 to aid recruiting and to raise charity funds. Mobbs then arranged one final Barbarians match against the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC), leading a team made up <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>personnel,</b> including Geen in his last Barbarians appearance, to a 10–3 victory. Of Geen's teammates on that day, Mobbs and another England international Arthur James Dingle, would also die in action during the war.|$|E
5|$|Within the United States armed forces, {{according}} to an unscientific survey, the president was strongly supported in the 2004 presidential elections. While 73percent <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>personnel</b> {{said that they would}} vote for Bush, 18percent preferred his Democratic rival, John Kerry. According to Peter Feaver, a Duke University political scientist who has studied the political leanings of the U.S. military, members of the armed services supported Bush because they found him more likely than Kerry to complete the War in Iraq.|$|E
5|$|He was unfortunate {{again on}} 22 April 1943 when, {{in command of}} Camilla on an RAAF {{contract}} involving the transport <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>personnel</b> to Port Moresby, he found himself unable to proceed due to bad weather, {{and was forced to}} attempt a night landing on the open ocean when off the coast of New Guinea. Due largely to the inexperience of his co-pilot, the aircraft broke up on landing, and 13 out of the 31 people on board did not survive. Koch spent about 18 hours in the sea before being rescued at the chance passage of a local steamer. A. B. Corbett, the Director-General of Civil Aviation, recommended to his Minister that in view of the circumstances no Court of Inquiry be held—in effect Koch was exonerated.|$|E

5|$|The {{difficulty}} of maintaining {{an air force}} with little funding {{during a time of}} rapid technological development was compounded by the Swiss militia system: all but a handful <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>personnel</b> were citizen soldiers who served only a few weeks each year following their initial recruitment phase. Military pilot candidates underwent the same recruit training, NCO school and officer candidate school as other Swiss army officers, followed by a pilot school of 173days, then re-entered civilian life. During his first two years of service, a pilot's training continued with ten logged flight hours per month, and thereafter he was required to fly fifty hours per year at his convenience.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth of}} the new middle class in Syria fueled discontent since the {{traditional}} elite dominated the agrarian sector – the largest {{sector of the economy}} – and created most of the wealth. The new middle class consisted of capitalists and entrepreneurs who opposed the traditional elite – the monopolisation of power by the traditional elite led to the radicalisation of the new middle class. The military, which in many countries is conservative and elitist, became radicalised in Syria because the military wanted greater power, believing that the traditional elite were unable to defend the country. A significant group <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>personnel</b> were recruited from the new middle class or from the hinterlands.|$|E
5|$|UNCRO {{was also}} tasked with {{delivery}} of humanitarian aid and control, monitoring, and reporting of any transport <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>personnel,</b> supplies, equipment, or weapons across UNCRO-staffed border checkpoints between RSK-held parts of Croatia {{on one side}} and Bosnia and Herzegovina or the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on the other. There were 25 border checkpoints manned by UNCRO. The mandate also directed UNCRO to monitor demilitarisation of the Prevlaka Peninsula {{at the entrance to the}} Bay of Kotor, according to the UNSC Resolution 779. Deployment of UNCRO was formally approved by the UNSC on 28 April. The mission was scheduled to be scaled down in June to 8,750 troops from the larger UNPROFOR force in the country.|$|E

5|$|Attempting {{to pacify}} the population, Amin {{released}} {{a list of}} 18,000 {{people who had been}} executed, and blamed the executions on Taraki. The total number of arrested during Taraki's and Amin's combined reign number between 17,000 and 45,000. Amin was not liked by the Afghan people. During his rule, opposition to the communist regime increased, and the government lost control of the countryside. The state of the Afghan military deteriorated; due to desertions the number <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>personnel</b> in the Afghan army decreased from 100,000 {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the Saur Revolution, to somewhere between 50,000 and 70,000. Another problem Amin faced was the KGB's penetration of the PDPA, the military and the government bureaucracy. While Amin's position in Afghanistan was becoming more perilous by the day, his enemies who were exiled in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc were agitating for his removal. Babrak Karmal, the Parchamite leader, met several leading Eastern Bloc figures during this period, and Mohammad Aslam Watanjar, Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoy and Assadullah Sarwari wanted to exact revenge upon Amin.|$|E
5|$|Committed {{to living}} the {{philosophy}} they sing about, {{the band members}} have each pursued careers apart from their lives as the superstars of Malagasy pop music. Most {{of the members of}} Mahaleo have also launched individual humanitarian projects, in addition to the cooperative they formed together in the 1980s to support the hand-made production of traditional musical instruments, and the Centre des informations de communication, d'animation, formation et d'éducation (CICAFE) rural development center they launched in 2000. As the years passed {{and the members of the}} band matured in their respective careers, they started to write songs more relevant to the difficult conditions of life of the Malagasy people and the underdeveloped state of the nation, addressing such topics as environmental conservation, poverty, education, and violence. Among their hits in this period are songs that address rural-urban flight, homesickness after moving abroad to find work, husbands who abandon their families, and the guilt <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>personnel</b> required to carry out repression against their compatriots.|$|E
5|$|In September 1999, SAS {{announced}} that if Braathens {{took the first}} step to reduce capacity between Bergen and Oslo, they would follow immediately to reduce the overcapacity in the combined 37 daily departures. However, Braathens was not willing to reduce. On 15 September, Color Air {{announced that}} they would start flying five round trips from Oslo to Stavanger on 1 October, following the delivery of their fourth aircraft. At the same time, the airline would reduce the number of round trips to Ålesund from four to two. In January 1999, Braathens applied to register twenty of its Norwegian aircraft in Sweden, following their discovery that foreign-registered aircraft, such as Color Air's and SAS', did not have to pay value added tax on good sold on board. This was rejected by the Norwegian Armed Forces, who based their need of transport <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>personnel</b> during wartime on requisition of civilian, Norwegian-registered aircraft. The same month, Geir Olsen, head of Braathens in Sweden, withdrew from his position, due to disagreements about the corporate strategy.|$|E
