5|$|Many {{cities in}} Poland now have {{memorials}} to the massacre in public spaces {{as well as}} within churches and cemeteries. For example, in Wrocław, a composition by Polish sculptor Tadeusz Tchórzewski {{is dedicated to the}} Katyn victims. Unveiled in 2000, it is located in a park east of the city's centre, near the Racławice Panorama building. It shows the 'Matron of the Homeland' despairing over a dead soldier, while <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> plinth the angel of death looms over, leaning forward on a sword.|$|E
5|$|The {{research}} {{showed that}} companies that considered design <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> {{level of the}} ladder were constantly growing. Additionally, the Danish Design Centre published an Evaluation of the Importance of Design in 2006, {{with the result that}} most companies considered design as a promoter for innovation (71%), as a growth potential for the company (79%), and to make products more user friendly (71%). With increasing importance of design for the company, design management also becomes more important.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Dalton felt {{jealous of}} boys {{for the freedom}} they enjoyed. They could travel alone without {{worrying}} about their reputation and were often bribed to attend school, while girls were, in her opinion, educated reluctantly. One of her teachers {{thought it would be}} wasteful for her to study algebra, as she already had sufficient education for a housewife. As a young woman, she felt that women lived <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> moral level than men. She saw polygamy as a way to allow more women to marry the few good men, arguing that it gave more women the opportunity to marry. She also considered it ironic that prostitution was tolerated but polygamy was considered depraved.|$|E
5|$|The first 37 {{issues of}} the main series were {{released}} in thirteen digests titled G.I. Joe Comic Magazine. Subsequently, Tales of G.I. Joe reprinted the first fifteen issues of G.I. Joe <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> quality paper stock than that used for the main comic. Four Yearbooks (1985–1988) also collected some previous stories, summarized events, and published new stories that tied into the main title, aside from the first Yearbook, which re-printed the seminal first issue. The series was also translated into several languages, including German, Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, French (Canada), Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, Danish, Japanese, Arabic, and Indonesian.|$|E
5|$|With {{the ongoing}} {{conflict}} with Chart House {{on the mind}} of the company's board in 1978, Burger King hired McDonald's executive Donald N. Smith to help revamp the company. Smith initiated a restructuring of all future franchising agreements. New owners were barred from living more than an hour's drive from their restaurants, corporations were not permitted to own franchises, and franchisees could no longer operate other chains. This new policy effectively limited the size of franchisees and prevented larger franchises from challenging Burger King as Chart House had. It also became a requirement for the corporation to own the properties of any new store and lease them to franchisees. This policy would allow the company to take over the operations of failing stores or evict those owners who would not conform to the company guidelines and policies. Beyond the changes to the franchise system, Smith also restructured Burger King's corporate operations to better compete against his former employer as well as then up and coming chain Wendy's. He broadened the product offering by adding the Burger King specialty sandwich line in 1979, and also added many non-hamburger sandwiches including new chicken and fish offerings. The new line {{was one of the first}} attempts by a major fast food chain to target a specific demographic, in this case adults aged between 18 and 34 years, members of which were presumably willing spend more <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> quality product. The new products were successful and the company's sales increased by 15%.|$|E

25|$|Manatees hear <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> {{frequency}} {{than would}} be expected for such large marine mammals. Many large boats emit very low frequencies, which confuse the manatee and explain their lack of awareness around boats. The Lloyd's mirror effect results in low frequency propeller sounds not being discernible near the surface, where most accidents occur. Research indicates that when a boat has a higher frequency the manatees rapidly swim away from danger.|$|E

25|$|The shrine {{room was}} {{situated}} in the north-west wing of the villa. Its only access point {{seems to have been}} the staircase leading from rooms <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> terrace. During the early excavations, the walls of this room were found covered with a coat of stucco painted in panels of different colours. Niches in the north wall that probably accommodated statues and a possible altar base have led the archaeologists to suggest that the room had a religious function.|$|E

(Cook Islands finished second based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> net run rate.) The closest match was the rain-shortened third match where Japan, chasing 74, rallied from a 5-over total of 14/3 to defeat the Cook Islands on the Duckworth-Lewis method.|$|E

25|$|The highway was Secondary State Highway 1R (SSH1R) from 1937 until 1964. SSH1R {{ran from}} Castle Rock {{to the border}} of the Columbia National Forest (now known as the Gifford Pinchot National Forest) from 1937 until 1961. In 1961, the Washington State Legislature {{extended}} SSH1R east to Spirit Lake. In 1964, SSH1R became SR504. When Mount St. Helens erupted on May 18, 1980, SR504 was closed and was heavily damaged from SR505 to Spirit Lake. The highway was rebuilt and partially opened in 1991 <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> and safer route to Coldwater Ridge. The new highway was completed when the road to the Johnston Ridge Observatory was opened in 1994.|$|E
25|$|There were motives {{behind the}} aristocratic {{officials}} and later scholar-officials' classifying of certain {{groups in the}} hierarchy and leaving others out. The scholar-officials placed farmers as the second most prestigious group because the aristocratic officials and scholar-officials were landholders themselves, much like farmers (the ones who weren't tenant farmers or serfs). Both farmers and artisans were placed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> tier than merchants because the two former groups produced crops and manufactured goods, essential things needed by the whole of society. The merchants were seen as merely talented at business and trading, and were often seen as greedy and even parasitic {{to the needs of}} all other groups.|$|E
25|$|Thus, then, {{a typical}} phrase {{in the most}} {{familiar}} Gregorian mode, such as was daily in the ears of the Rhenish Jews, in secular {{as well as in}} ecclesiastical music, was centuries ago deemed suitable for the recitation of the Absolution of Vows, and to it was afterward prefixed an introductory intonation dependent on the taste and capacity of the officiant. Many times repeated, the figure of this central phrase was sometimes sung <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> degree of the scale, sometimes on a lower. Then these became associated; and so gradually the middle section of the melody developed into the modern forms.|$|E
