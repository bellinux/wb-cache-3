While it did not ban or make illegal the Hawaiian language in other contexts, its implementation in the schools had far reaching effects. The banishment was only two years removed from acknowledgement as a legitimate sovereign government. From July 1894 to January 1895, 19 nations, including the United States, recognized Hawai'i as an independent country. [...] Those who had been pushing for English-only schools took this law as licence to extinguish the native language at the early education level. While the law stopped short of making Hawaiian illegal (it was still the dominant language spoken at the time), many children who spoke Hawaiian at school, including on the playground, were disciplined. This included corporal punishment {{and going to the}} home of the <b>offending</b> <b>child</b> to strongly advise them to stop speaking it in their home. Moreover, the law specifically provided for teaching languages [...] "in addition to the English language," [...] reducing Hawaiian to the status of a foreign language, subject to approval by the Department. Hawaiian was not taught initially in any school, including the all-Hawaiian Kamehameha Schools. This is largely because when these schools were founded, like Kamehameha Schools founded in 1887 (nine years before this law), Hawaiian was being spoken in the home. Once this law was enacted, individuals at these institutions took it upon themselves to enforce a ban on Hawaiian. Beginning in 1900, Mary Kawena Pukui, who was later the co-author of the Hawaiian-English Dictionary, was punished for speaking Hawaiian by being rapped on the forehead, allowed to eat only bread and water for lunch, and denied home visits on holidays. Winona Beamer was expelled from Kamehameha Schools in 1937 for chanting Hawaiian.|$|E

40|$|Victim age is {{commonly}} used in the classification of juvenile sexual offenders (JSOs). However, the results of studies comparing JSOs who offend peers (peer offenders) with those who <b>offend</b> <b>children</b> (child molesters) are variable and inconclusive.

Some studies use victim age, others use offender–victim age discrepancies, and still others use a combination of victim age and age discrepancies to classify JSOs. These variations may result in samples of JSOs that are not comparable across studies. The primary purpose of the present research was to examine the strength of the relationship between JSO subgroup membership (child, peer, and mixed offenders) and personal, criminal history, and offense history variables using several different classification methods commonly used in JSO research.

40|$|The thesis {{contains}} two papers concerned {{with women who}} sexually <b>offend</b> against <b>children.</b> The first document is a theoretical {{review of the literature}} considering whether a therapeutic approach, Compassionate Mind Training (CMT), could be successfully applied to females who sexually <b>offend</b> against <b>children.</b> CMT aims to develop a person’s self-caring and compassionate mentality. It is argued that CMT could be used to tackle certain existing psychological difficulties; (a) attachment disorder, (b) shame, and (c) low self-esteem. It is suggested that adopting CMT would improve the effectiveness of offence-based intervention techniques and in some cases allow women to access such programmes when their psychological difficulties would previously have prevented this. The second document reports upon the Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) of a small number of semi-structured interviews with females who sexually <b>offend</b> against <b>children.</b> The analysis focuses on the way in which these participants make sense of their early relationships, specifically their experiences of care and compassion, and the means by which they understand and make sense of their experiences. One cluster of themes is presented: ‘expectations of parents’ roles’. The women’s stories are interpreted and the similarities and differences between the women’s experiences are discussed.

40|$|Objectives: Within the {{literature}} on sex offending, much {{attention is paid to}} the distinction between those sex offenders who offend against adults and those who <b>offend</b> against <b>children.</b> In contrast, there is a paucity of research into sex offenders who offend specifically against elderly or older victims. Method: A detailed interview and psychometric tests were conducted with a sample of 28 sex offenders who had been convicted of a sexually motivated offence against an older female. These data were compared to a sample of 23 child sex offenders. Results: Results indicate that amongst other significant differences between these sub-groups, men who offend against older women are generally younger, are more violent, {{and are more likely to}} use a weapon and cause injury and death compared to child sex offenders. The men who <b>offended</b> against <b>children</b> were more likely to think about and plan their offending, spend more time with the victim pre and post offence, admit sexual arousal during the offence, and admit to a sexual motivation for the offence. Conclusions: This study suggests that men who sexually offend against older women and men who sexually <b>offend</b> against <b>children</b> are distinct groups. Treatment and risk management strategies should take this into account. Further exploration of this sub-group of offenders is recommended to help inform treatment and risk management strategies for sex offenders who offend against older people...|$|R
40|$|A {{progressive}} {{exploration of}} the role of personality in understanding <b>offending</b> in a <b>child</b> molester sample was undertaken. A particular focus was {{the extent to which the}} construct of personality could be used to reduce or account for some of the heterogeneity reported in this population. The studies used a sample of 110 participants in the Kia Marama treatment programme for sexual offenders against children. In the first of four studies these subjects were divided into four subgroups using cluster analysis of their scores on the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI) personality scales. The clusters resembled clusters found in other offender populations. A second study showed that while the four clusters were very similar on a range of demographic and background factors, they differed on a range of psychometric tests commonly used to assess child molesters. They were also found to respond differently to treatment. A third study investigated the possibility that the four clusters differed on factors that were directly related to their offending. The clusters were found not to differ in terms of their selection of victims, their relationship to victims, the extent and duration of their offending history, their convictions for sexual and other offences, their risk for future offending, or their actual re-offending rates following release after treatment. A fourth study further investigated the differences among the clusters regarding offending by analysing accounts of sexual <b>offending</b> behaviour against <b>children</b> held on police files. The clusters did not differ significantly on the measures used. A clinical profile is offered for each cluster. The clinical implications for the results are discussed with respect to risk, needs, and responsivity. Further theoretical implications are discussed together with a consideration of the contribution that personality makes to an understanding of sexual <b>offending</b> against <b>children.</b> The studies did not establish a link between personality and the actual <b>offending</b> behaviour of <b>child</b> molesters...|$|R

40|$|Criminal {{behaviour}} {{of parents}} {{can be seen}} as an important risk factor considering juvenile offending. The aim of the present study is to examine the extent in which frequency and seriousness of parental offending was related to <b>offending</b> of their <b>child.</b> Police officers in the Netherlands filled out a form when they came in contact with juvenile offenders to registrate risk factors and undertaken actions. All children were aged 8 to 14 years. Earlier police contacts as well as crimes committed in the eighteen months after the form was filled out, were checked in the police systems, so a good insight of all committed crimes of the juveniles was obtained. Further, the parents of these juveniles were traced inthe police systems, to see whether they showed criminal activities. Finally, data were gathered on 577 juveniles and their parents, of which 34 % (n = 196) of the children was exposed to parental criminal behaviour. Of the 34 %, 33 children seemed to have two criminal parents and 163 children had one parent showing criminal activities. Children having both parents showing criminal activities,were the ones showing the highest frequency of offending. Furthermore, the frequency of parental offending was positively related to the frequency of offendingof the child. Concerning seriousness of parental offending, the more serious the offending of the father, the more serious the <b>offending</b> of the <b>child</b> appeared to be. Surprisingly, the more serious the committed crimes of mothers,the less serious the <b>child’s</b> <b>offending.</b> These results points to the influential role criminality of parents have on <b>offending</b> of their <b>child.</b> Early interventions must be taken in high risk families in which the parents show criminal activities...|$|R

The original title of the research project, {{in the name of}} Dr Anna Stewart and Dr Susan Dennison, was 'Pathways from child maltreatment to juvenile offending'. The project aimed to examine in detail the risk factor of child maltreatment and the effect maltreatment has on engagement in juvenile <b>offending.</b> All <b>children</b> born in 1983 who had contact with either the Queensland child protection system or the juvenile justice system, as recorded by the Queensland Department of Families, were included in the study. There were 4, 655 children who came into contact with the child protection system. The majority of these children (62 %) were the victims of multiple incidents of maltreatment (30 % of substantiated notifications). Children with substantiated maltreatment were more likely (17 %) to come {{to the attention of the}} department for juvenile <b>offending</b> than <b>children</b> with notifications that were not substantiated (10 %). Of <b>children</b> who <b>offended,</b> 18 % had been the victim of child maltreatment. Maltreated <b>children</b> who <b>offended</b> were more likely than maltreated children who did not offend to be male, Indigenous, to be older at the final maltreatment episode (but not younger at the first), neglected or physically abused, have more notifications and be more likely to be placed outside the home because of maltreatment. Although not all children who are maltreated offend, these results indicate that the frequency, severity and type of maltreatment increases the risk of <b>children</b> <b>offending.</b> The results have important implications for the prevention of juvenile offending.

40|$|Cognitive distortions {{are held}} to {{contribute}} to sexual <b>offending</b> against <b>children</b> {{in a number of}} theoretical explanations of such crimes. However, not only is there little or no direct evidence in support of the centrality of cognitive distortions in offending but recent research has questioned whether the concept has explanatory power. Cognitive distortions are variously seen as necessary for the offender to <b>offend</b> against <b>children,</b> as post-offending justifications for the offence, or as reflecting distorted patterns in the offender’s upbringing. This paper explores the role of cognitive distortions in sex offending by comparing the distortions of contact sex offenders against children with Internet child pornography offenders without contact offences against children. A new cognitive distortions questionnaire was developed which was suitable for administration to Internet offenders who had no contact offences against children as well as being suitable for contact offenders. It was found that some cognitive distortions are frequently agreed with by sex offenders against children whereas others were seldom or never agreed with. Little support was found for earlier typological approaches to the cognitive schema of sex offenders against children. Contrary to the expectation that contact offenders would have more cognitive distortions, it was found that Internet offenders had more cognitiv...|$|R

5000|$|Seto {{has been}} noted as [...] "one of the {{foremost}} authorities" [...] on adolescent sex offenders. Much of his {{research has focused on}} the psychological characteristics of sex offenders, their risk for reoffending, and the relationship between paraphilias and sexual offending. He has suggested in his book on pedophilia and sexual offending that perhaps 3% of men are sexually attracted to prepubescent children. Pedophilia is related to sexual <b>offending</b> against <b>children,</b> but they are not synonymous: Some pedophiles are not known to have ever committed sexual offenses against children, and some offenders are not pedophiles, motivated instead by high sex drive, criminality, or opportunism. Controversially, Seto has suggested that pedophilia can be understood as a sexual orientation with regard to age, just as heterosexuality, bisexuality, or homosexuality can be understood as sexual orientations with regard to gender. In his research on online offending, Seto has discovered {{that there may be a}} closer link between pedophilia, and child pornography use than between pedophilia and sexual <b>offending</b> against <b>children</b> directly. This does not mean pedophilia is the only motivation, but it does appear to be the most important. Despite this strong association with pedophilia, online sexual offenders appear to be at relatively low risk of reoffending, suggesting other factors such as personality must be involved. In related research, he and his colleagues have demonstrated that the same kinds of risk factors are valid for online offenders as they are for conventional contact offenders, including age, criminal history, substance use, and sexual attraction to children. This research is summarized in his book on online sexual offending.|$|R

40|$|Sexual <b>offending</b> against <b>children</b> {{is among}} the most serious of crimes, and so it is {{imperative}} to have empirical evidence that prison-based treatment programmes for such offenders are successful in reducing the likelihood of future recidivism. The present study examined the criminal history and post-release outcomes for sexual offenders against children who had attended the Kia Marama Special Treatment Unit (STU; treated group; N = 428) and were followed up for an average of 6. 36 years, and a cohort of offenders who were also incarcerated for sexual <b>offending</b> against <b>children</b> but did not attend Kia Marama or a similar STU (untreated group; N = 1956) and were followed up for an average of 6. 81 years. During the follow-up, rates of recidivism (defined as a charge for a new offence) for the untreated and treated groups, respectively were: 7. 52 % and 7. 24 % (sexual); 18. 35 % and 10. 28 % (violent); and 38. 24 % and 32. 71 % (general). There were significant differences between the groups in terms of offence history: The treated group had more prior sexual offences, more prior sentencing dates, more non-contact offences, was more likely to have had a male victim, a longer sentence duration, and an overall higher static risk score, whereas the untreated group {{were more likely to be}} young (< 25 years at release) and had more prior violent convictions. To control for differences in risk level between the two groups, we used stepwise logistic regression to develop predictive models for recidivism, and then tested whether treatment group was related to recidivism. Because the design was unbalanced and groups were heterogeneous, to obtain the best estimate of model coefficients we used a differential weighting factor that compensated for the unequal group sizes. Results showed that the treatment group was associated with a significant reduction in sexual, violent and general recidivism. The estimated coefficient for the treatment group indicated a 29. 4 % reduction in sexual recidivism (odds ratio [OR] =. 706), a 49. 3 % reduction in violent recidivism (OR =. 507) and a 27. 6 % reduction in general recidivism (OR =. 724). This result implies that the expected sexual recidivism rate of the treated group would have been 10. 0 % rather than 7. 2 % had they not attended the STU. The present findings update previous results of Marentette (2009) with a more comprehensive sample, and add to the growing evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural and relapseprevention- based treatment for sexual offenders against children. Our results provide further evidence of the effectiveness of the Kia Marama STU (see also Beggs & Grace, 2011) and endorse the utility of such programmes for reducing sexual <b>offending</b> against <b>children</b> in New Zealand...|$|R
