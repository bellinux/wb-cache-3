5|$|Although {{the seeds}} of both {{proactive}} government repression against the Puerto Rican independence movement had been planted before the Grito de Lares, and its aftermath only guaranteed the surge of autonomism as a political alternative in the island, the level of cultural and social development <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>collective</b> Puerto Rican conscience was almost {{a direct consequence of}} the event. To put it simply, if there is any nationalistic sentiment in Puerto Rico in the present day, almost all of it {{can be traced back to}} Betances and his political work.|$|E

5|$|Suslov {{lost much}} of the {{recognition}} and influence he had earned following the reshuffle of the Soviet leadership after Stalin's death. However, by the late 1950s, Suslov had risen to become {{the leader of the}} hardline opposition to Nikita Khrushchev's more moderate leadership. After Khrushchev was ousted in 1964, Suslov supported the establishment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>collective</b> leadership. He also supported inner-party democracy and opposed the reestablishment of the one-man rule as seen during the Stalin and Khrushchev Eras. During the Brezhnev Era, Suslov was considered to be the Party's Chief Ideologue and second-in-command. His death on 25 January 1982 is viewed as starting the battle to succeed Leonid Brezhnev in the post of General Secretary.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, {{the players}} were locked out by the owners {{because of a lack}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Collective</b> Bargaining Agreement (CBA). The 1994–95 NHL lockout lasted 104days and {{resulted}} in the season's being shortened from a planned 84 games to 48. The owners insisted on a salary cap, changes to free agency and arbitration in the hopes of limiting escalating salaries, the union instead proposed a luxury tax system. Just as the entire season seemed to be lost, an 11th-hour deal was agreed on. The owners failed to achieve a full salary cap but the deal was initially hailed as a win for the owners. The deal was not enough to save two teams in Canada's smallest NHL markets. The revenue disparity between large and small market teams, exacerbated by the falling value of the Canadian Dollar, forced the Quebec Nordiques to move to Denver and become the Colorado Avalanche in 1995; the Winnipeg Jets relocated to Phoenix, Arizona, becoming the Coyotes, the next year. The Hartford Whalers followed, moving to Greensboro, NC and becoming the Carolina Hurricanes in 1997. The NHL continued its expansion into cities in the Southern United States. In 1998, the Nashville Predators joined the league, followed by the Atlanta Thrashers the following year. To further market their players, the NHL decided to have its players play in the Winter Olympics, starting in 1998, at the Nagano Games. In 2000, the league added two franchises, boosting the total number to 30. The NHL returned to Minnesota with the Wild and added the Blue Jackets in Columbus, Ohio.|$|E

25|$|The duty {{applies to}} {{virtually}} every action that a union might take {{in dealing with}} an employer as the representative of employees, from its negotiation of the terms <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining agreement, to its handling of grievances arising under that agreement, {{as well as its}} operation of an exclusive hiring hall and its enforcement of the union security provisions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining agreement.

25|$|Arbitration {{may also}} serve a {{distinct}} purpose: {{as an alternative}} to strikes and lockouts as a means of resolving labor disputes. Labor arbitration comes in two varieties: interest arbitration, which provides a method for resolving disputes about the terms to be included in a new contract when the parties are unable to agree, and grievance arbitration, which provides a method for resolving disputes over the interpretation and application <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining agreement.|$|E

25|$|H.

In giving priority to this religious collective rather than individual liberty, the Islamic law justifies the formal inequality of individuals (women, non-Islamic people). Bassam Tibi states that sharia framework and human rights are incompatible. Abdel al-Hakeem Carney, in contrast, states that sharia is misunderstood from a failure to distinguish sharia from siyasah (politics).|$|E

25|$|Story Gathering Boxes, an ongoing, {{participatory}} artwork, {{was initiated}} in 1972. Each piece {{in this series}} consists of a box with four chambers made out of poplar wood.

The imagery is created out of mixed media like paint and leather. The paper cards contain prompts, inviting viewers to contribute personal stories on various topics, such as gender, domestic violence, and immigration.
