40|$|<b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study}} was to {{elucidate}} the mechanisms by which sucrose improves growth in a hypertonic medium for isolating aerobes from blood. Clinical blood cultures were made routinely in duplicate in plain broth consisting of brain heart infusion broth with sodium polyanetholesulfonate, gelatin, and penicillinase and the same broth with 20 % sucrose added. <b>The</b> growth patterns <b>of</b> Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacteriaceae from plain and from hypertonic broth were correlated with {{the presence or absence of}} antimicrobial therapy in patients when <b>the</b> blood <b>cultures</b> were collected. In S. aureus bacteremias, 58. 7 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> positive <b>cultures</b> collected during treatment of patients with beta-lactam antibiotics showed earlier growth or growth only in hypertonic broth, compared with 16. 7 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cultures</b> taken during treatment with other antimicrobial agents (P less than 0. 05) and 17. 6 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cultures</b> made in antibiotic-free intervals (P less than 0. 01).

5|$|According to {{linguists}} like Bhadriraju Krishnamurti, Tamil, as a Dravidian language, descends from Proto-Dravidian, a Proto-language. Linguistic reconstruction {{suggests that}} Proto-Dravidian was spoken around {{the third millennium}} BC, possibly in the region around the lower Godavari river basin in peninsular India. The material {{evidence suggests that the}} speakers of Proto-Dravidian were <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> associated with the Neolithic complexes of South India. The next phase in the reconstructed proto-history of Tamil is Proto-South Dravidian. The linguistic evidence suggests that Proto-South Dravidian was spoken around the middle of the second millennium BC, and that proto-Tamil emerged around the 3rd century BC. The earliest epigraphic attestations of Tamil are generally taken to have been written shortly thereafter. Among Indian languages, Tamil has the most ancient non-Sanskritised Indian literature. Scholars categorise the attested history of the language into three periods, Old Tamil (300 BC – AD 700), Middle Tamil (700–1600) and Modern Tamil (1600–present). In November 2007, an excavation at Quseir-al-Qadim revealed Egyptian pottery dating back to first century BC with ancient Tamil Brahmi inscriptions. John Guy states that Tamil was the lingua franca for early maritime traders from India.|$|E

5|$|Cockfighting {{is said to}} be the world's oldest spectator {{sport and}} may have {{originated}} in Persia 6,000 years ago.

The sport formed part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> of the ancient Indians, Chinese, Greeks, and Romans, and large sums were won or lost depending on the outcome of an encounter. Cockfighting has been banned in many countries during the last century on the grounds of cruelty to animals.|$|E

5|$|In {{the modern}} world, dance {{has come to}} be {{regarded}} as something one does for recreation, thus distancing dance from the important place it has held in many human cultures throughout history—that is, a method of expression, preservation and transmission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> and history of a people. Many of the activities that humans have engaged in for millennia (religion and courtship, for example) have traditionally found expression in various kinds of dance. Another activity—combat—has obviously been central to the life of most human cultures; thus, one expects to find dances that celebrate skill in the use of weapons. Indeed, there is a wide range of such weapon dances in the world; they vary from general displays of prowess in the use of weapons to reenactments of real episodes of combat specific to a given culture.|$|E
