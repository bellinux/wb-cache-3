5|$|The Emeco 1006 (pronounced ten-oh-six), {{also known}} as the Navy chair, is an {{aluminum}} chair manufactured by Emeco. The 1006 was originally built for Navy warships during World War II, but later became a designer chair used in high-end restaurants and by interior designers. In the 1990s, the company began creating designer versions of the 1006 chair, such as the stackable Hudson chair and the 111 Navy Chair made from recycled plastic. Emeco also makes stools, tables, and <b>other</b> <b>furniture.</b> As of 2012, more than one million Emeco 1006 chairs have been produced.|$|E
5|$|The east range, of c.1635, {{comprises}} a long, narrow building, {{with a short}} {{projecting wing}} to the south-east. It is {{the only part of}} the castle still roofed. The first floor of the wing is occupied by a long gallery, accessed from the central range, with stables and storerooms below. The long gallery was used for entertaining, and, in 1647, is recorded as containing 46 pictures and a harpsichord, among <b>other</b> <b>furniture.</b> In the south-east wing are three chambers, one on each floor, linked by a spiral stair. The first-floor room has a 17th-century painted ceiling, decorated with fruit, foliage, and heraldic emblems. The south-east wing has crow-step gables, and a sundial on one corner. The east window of the long gallery is decorated with pilasters and a pediment. The roof is of 18th-century date, and is lower than the original, resulting in the loss of the triangular pediments which once topped each of the side windows.|$|E

25|$|During the reigns of Louis XIV. and XV. the {{principal}} merit of carved design, i.e. its appropriateness and suitability, gradually disappeared. Furniture was often carved {{in a way}} hardly legitimate. The legs, the rails of tables and chairs, the frames of cabinets, of looking-glasses, instead of being first made fcr construction and strength. and then decorated, were first designed to carry cherubs heads and rococo (i.e. rock and shell ornament), quite regardless of utility or convenience. A wealth of such mistaken design was also applied to state carriages, {{to say nothing of}} bedsteads and <b>other</b> <b>furniture.</b> However, the wall paneling of the mansions of the rich, and sometimes the paneling of furniture, was decorated with rococo design in its least illegitimate form. The main part of the wood surface would be left plain, while the center would be carved with a medallion surrounded by foliage, vases or trophies of torches and musical instruments, etc., or perhaps {{the upper part of the}} panel would be thus treated. France led the fashion, which was more or less followed all over Europe. In England gilt chairs in the style of Louis XV. were made in some quantities. But Thomas Chippendale, Ince and Mayhew, Sheraton, Johnson, Heppelwhite and other cabinet-makers did not as a rule use much carving in their designs. Scrolls, shells, ribbon, ears of corn, etc., in very fine relief, were, however, used in the embellishment of chairs, etc., and the claw and ball foot was employed as a termination to the cabriole legs of cabinets and <b>other</b> <b>furniture.</b>|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time since the end of the British Mandate, Jews could visit the Old City of Jerusalem and pray at the Western Wall (the holiest site in modern Judaism), to which they had been denied access by the Jordanians in {{contravention}} of the 1949 Armistice agreement. The four-meter-wide public alley beside the Wall was expanded into a massive plaza and worshippers were allowed to sit, or use <b>other</b> <b>furniture,</b> for {{the first time}} in centuries. In Hebron, Jews gained access to the Cave of the Patriarchs (the second most holy site in Judaism) for {{the first time since}} the 14th century (previously Jews were only allowed to pray at the entrance). A third Jewish holy site, Rachel's Tomb, in Bethlehem, also became accessible. Sinai oil fields made Israel self-sufficient in energy.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s, the Basel region {{has seen a}} {{proliferation}} of new museums addressing themes of art and design, especially concerning works from more recent years. The Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein presents {{a broad range of}} design topics, with a special emphasis on furniture and interior design. Though originally based on the private collection of chairs and <b>other</b> <b>furniture</b> assembled by Rolf Fehlbaum, the owner of the Vitra furniture company, the museum was established as an independent institution. The Vitra building complex has made notable contributions to the body of avant-garde architecture in the Basel region. In addition to the 1989 museum by Frank O. Gehry, the grounds feature structures by Zaha Hadid, Nicholas Grimshaw, Tadao Ando and Álvaro Siza. In 1982, the Beyeler Foundation assumed ownership of the art collection of Hildy and Ernst Beyeler, which the couple had built up over half a century. Since 1997, the works of classical modern art have been exhibited in a building designed by Renzo Piano in the town of Riehen. Featured artists include Degas, Monet, Cézanne, van Gogh, Picasso, Rothko, Warhol, Lichtenstein and Bacon. The trees in the park surrounding the highly acclaimed building were wrapped by Christo and Jeanne-Claude in 1998.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{their day}} {{activities}} were over, Hotelito Desconocido offered a spa service using aromatherapy or stone therapy (through the alternation of warm river rocks and cool marbles stones). The {{part of the}} hotel where the open-air spa was offered was known as [...] "El Mundo de la Salud" [...] (English: The World of Health). Baths were also offered, and they included local ingredients like sea salt and botanical essential oils for skin care. The water used in the spas and baths was heated through the solar-powered panels the hotel had on its roofs. Each room was non-smoking and equipped with small battery-powered fans. The restrooms were open-air and had walls made of bamboo covered in indigenous mud. Frames on the walls were made of unfinished tree trunks. <b>Other</b> <b>furniture</b> and decorations were rustic Mexican-styled.|$|E

2500|$|The case {{also gives}} the {{harpsichord}} its external appearance and protects the instrument. [...] A large harpsichord is, in a sense, {{a piece of}} furniture, as it stands alone on legs and may be styled {{in the manner of}} <b>other</b> <b>furniture</b> of its place and period. [...] Early Italian instruments, on the other hand, were so light in construction that they were treated rather like a violin: kept for storage in a protective outer case, and played after taking it out of its case and placing it on a table. [...] Such tables were often quite high – until the late 18th century people usually played standing up. [...] Eventually, harpsichords came to be built with just a single case, though an intermediate stage also existed: [...] the false inner–outer, which for purely aesthetic reasons was built to look as if the outer case contained an inner one, in the old style. [...] Even after harpsichords became self-encased objects, they often were supported by separate stands, and some modern harpsichords have separate legs for improved portability.|$|E
2500|$|The Entrance Hall is {{in three}} bays. [...] It is {{decorated}} in neoclassical style with a marble floor, red porphyry Ionic columns and a geometric coffered, tunnel vaulted ceiling. [...] The furniture includes two late-17th-century Italian {{chests of drawers}} and a walnut chest dating from around 1730, and a 19th-century walnut table and chairs. On each side of a central niche are marble busts of the Duke of Wellington and William Pitt the Younger on columns. [...] The largest painting in the entrance hall is The Cheshire Hunt, 1839 by Henry Calvert. [...] To {{the west of the}} entrance hall is the Card Room (where calling cards were left - not for playing cards, as in other Card Rooms). This room has a neoclassical cornice and fireplace. [...] A set of open arm chairs are English in the Adam style which date from around 1785. [...] <b>Other</b> <b>furniture</b> dates from the 19th century in Louis XVI marquetry style. In a showcase is a rare silver filigree Horn Book. [...] Paintings in the room include La Gouvernante by Chardin, The Head of an Old Man, 1639 by Abraham Bloemaert, A Farrier's by Philips Wouwerman, and Head of Nicodemus after Rogier van der Weyden.|$|E
2500|$|Belknap's second wife, Carita, was {{socially}} {{ambitious and}} unwilling to live off Belknap's annual $8,000 salary in Washington D.C. When the couple arrived in Washington from Keokuk, Iowa in 1869, Belknap rented a large house recently vacated by Secretary of State William H. Seward. In hosting large parties like other cabinet members, the Belknaps over extended their invitations; one of their events had 1,200 guests in attendance, including many young army officers; the resulting raucous behavior led to extensive damage and vandalism, including destruction of curtains, couches, and <b>other</b> <b>furniture.</b> The Belknaps {{could not afford to}} pay for the damages, and had to leave Washington society and reduce expenses by living in a boarding house, or find a way to replenish their losses. They decided to look for additional income, and Carita engineered a plan to obtain a lucrative [...] "cash cow" [...] Indian tradership position at the recently built Fort Sill, located in the Oklahoma Indian Territory. Carita lobbied her husband to appoint a New York contractor, Caleb P. Marsh, to the Fort Sill tradership; John S. Evans, an experienced sutler, had already been appointed {{and did not want to}} give it up. To settle the question, Marsh drew up an illicit partnership contract which allowed Evans to keep the tradership at Fort Sill, provided that he pay Marsh $12,000 per year in quarterly installments. [...] Marsh, in turn, was required to give half of his $12,000 to Carita, also in quarterly installments. All the parties agreed to the arrangement; however, Carita only received one payment before her death from tuberculosis after childbirth in December 1870.|$|E
