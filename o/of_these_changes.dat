In response to strong demand, DC began publishing more superhero titles including Justice League of America, which prompted Marvel Comics to follow suit beginning with Fantastic Four #1.|$|E
5|$|National Treasures {{have been}} {{designated}} {{according to the}} Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties starting from June 9, 1951. This law, which is still in force, has since been supplemented with amendments and additional laws that reorganized the system for protection and preservation and extended its scope to a larger variety of cultural properties. Some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>changes</b> indirectly affected the protection of designated National Treasures.|$|E

5|$|A {{prerequisite}} for natural selection {{to result in}} adaptive evolution, novel traits and speciation {{is the presence of}} heritable genetic variation that results in fitness differences. Genetic variation is the result of mutations, genetic recombinations and alterations in the karyotype (the number, shape, size and internal arrangement of the chromosomes). Any <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>changes</b> might have an effect that is highly advantageous or highly disadvantageous, but large effects are rare. In the past, most changes in the genetic material were considered neutral or close to neutral because they occurred in noncoding DNA or resulted in a synonymous substitution. However, many mutations in non-coding DNA have deleterious effects. Although both mutation rates and average fitness effects of mutations are dependent on the organism, a majority of mutations in humans are slightly deleterious.|$|E
5|$|Chng Suan Tze was {{followed}} by amendments by Parliament to the Constitution and the ISA in 1989 which purported to return the applicable law regarding judicial review of government discretion under the ISA to that in Lee Mau Seng. The legality <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>changes</b> was challenged in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1990). In that decision, the Court of Appeal affirmed that the legislative amendments to the Act were plain and unambiguous, and thus validly established that the subjective test of judicial review now applied to internal security matters.|$|E
5|$|In January 2010, HMV Group {{announced}} that Waterstones like-for-like sales over the Christmas period were down 8.5 per cent {{on the previous}} year. This culminated in the resignation of managing director Gerry Johnson with immediate effect. He was replaced by development director Dominic Myers, who was {{managing director of the}} British academic bookselling chain Blackwells until 2005. Myers joined HMV in 2006 to oversee the integration of Ottakar's into the chain. In response to the decline in sales, he implemented a three-year plan in which branches were tailored to their local market alongside a 'rejuvenation' of the company brand and an increase in range. As part <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>changes,</b> Waterstones implemented new branding in May 2010, developed by agency VentureThree. The company also moved to support the Rainbow Trust, which provides support to children with life-threatening and terminal illnesses and their families, in the same year.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1960, the Australian Army {{adopted the}} Pentropic divisional structure, {{which was based}} on the {{establishment}} of five-company battalions. The result of this was a {{reduction in the number of}} CMF units, many of which were merged to form new units on the Pentropic establishment. At the same time, it was decided to amalgamate the old local and regional regiments that had existed into six new multi-battalion state-based regiments, such as the Royal Victoria Regiment. As a result <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>changes,</b> in July the 6th Battalion was merged with the 5th Battalion and the 58th/32nd Battalion to form the 1st Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment (1 RVR); within this organisation the 6th Battalion's identity was maintained by 'C' (Melbourne) Company. Prior to this, in March, the battalion had received the Freedom of the City from the City of Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{technical}} developments, Ferrari upgraded their engine for their home race by using {{three of their}} development tokens while Mercedes spent all seven of their remaining engine tokens. As a result of this, Mercedes became the first team in 2015 to use all their tokens, with both Honda and Ferrari having four tokens remaining and Renault having twelve tokens left for later in the season. Because <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>changes</b> both Mercedes cars were on their third powerplants, whilst both Ferrari cars were on their fourth power units. Additionally, Toro Rosso, Red Bull and McLaren received grid penalties for exceeding their parts usage, forcing them {{to start at the}} back of the grid. McLaren went back to using their snub nose design, which they had replaced earlier in the season ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix, in order to achieve better aerodynamics and lower drag for the high-speed Monza circuit.|$|E
5|$|Kinberg's wife Alice was {{a strong}} feminist, and during the 1980s {{he and his wife}} {{supported}} a number of changes to the liturgy and ritual. These included allowing women to read from the Torah and lead the prayers, and changing prayers to be more gender inclusive - for example, using gender-neutral terms and pronouns for God, and adding references to the Biblical matriarchs in prayers like the Amidah, which traditionally only mentioned the Biblical patriarchs. While most congregation members approved <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>changes,</b> a minority resisted them.|$|E

5|$|Prime was {{released}} for the GameCube in five versions. The original North American and Japanese NTSC versions {{and the second}} North American version, which contained minor changes, all used a loader that sometimes caused the game to freeze in specific rooms. The European PAL version resolved these glitches and contained altered elements of the gameplay to prevent sequence breaking, a slower loader that prevented the occasional crashes, slightly different story details, and narration in the opening and closing scenes. Some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>changes</b> were carried over from the PAL version to the NTSC region's Player's Choice re-release, along with additional changes not made in other releases. This version, which was bundled with a silver GameCube, also contained a second disc featuring a preview trailer and a demo for Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, a timeline of Metroid games, and an art gallery.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1929, MSHD started {{updating}} the route that US23 followed through the Lower Peninsula. Late that year, the routing {{was moved to}} {{the east side of the}} Saginaw River, and M-47 was extended along the former course on the west side of the river. During 1930, a set of changes realigned the highway's route through the southeast corner of the state. Near Ida, US23 was rerouted along M-50 to Dundee and north through Milan to Ann Arbor, bypassing Maybee and Whittaker. US23 was moved from its inland routing between Omer and Tawas City via Whittemore to follow a shoreline alignment by way of Au Gres along Saginaw Bay around 1932; the former route through Twining and Whittemore became an extension of M-65 and the section from Whittemore east to Tawas City was added to M-55 as a part <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>changes.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 1960s saw several {{important}} changes in popular music, especially rock. Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>changes</b> took place through the British Invasion where bands such as The Beatles, The Who, The Rolling Stones, became immensely popular {{and had a}} profound effect on American culture and music.These changes included the move from professionally composed songs to the singer-songwriter, and the understanding of popular music as an art, rather than a form of commerce or pure entertainment. These changes led to the rise of musical movements connected to political goals, such as the American Civil Rights Movement and the opposition to the Vietnam War. Rock was at the forefront of this change.|$|E

5|$|The German UB II design {{improved}} {{upon the}} design of the UB I boats, which had been ordered in September 1914. In service, the UB I boats were found to be too small and too slow. A major problem was that, because they had a single propeller shaft/engine combo, if either component failed, the U-boat became almost totally disabled. To rectify this flaw, the UB II boats featured twin propeller shafts and twin engines (one shaft for each engine), which also increased the U-boat's top speed. The new design also included more powerful batteries, larger torpedo tubes, and a deck gun. As a UB II boat, U-43 could also carry twice the torpedo load of her UB I counterparts, and nearly ten times as much fuel. To accommodate all <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>changes</b> the boats' had larger hulls, and surface and submerged displacements more than twice those of the UB I boats.|$|E
5|$|The M-43 {{designation}} {{dates back}} to at least July 1, 1919, when it was used {{on a series of}} roadways running between Kalamazoo and St. Charles. Its northern- and easternmost sections were transferred to other highways in the 1930s. Additions to M-43 extended it to its current termini. Several sections of the highway were realigned during its history, one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>changes</b> {{led to the creation of}} a business loop in Grand Ledge. Another former segment of the trunkline in the Lansing area has been renumbered M-143.|$|E

The London production was tailored slightly for a British audience, including minor creative changes to dialogue, choreography and special effects. A majority <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>changes</b> were later incorporated into all productions of Wicked. The changes include Elphaba meeting Fiyero when he first arrives at Shiz University. In addition, the waltz between Elphaba and the Wizard during Wonderful was removed.|$|E

5|$|The first {{remodeling}} {{work on the}} Ellwood Mansion {{took place}} as the 19th century drew to a close. The changes, commissioned by Isaac Ellwood, were meant to reflect more popular architectural styles including the Georgian and Colonial Revival. Many of the building's original Gothic features were replaced with more Classical elements. On the home's exterior, some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>changes</b> {{can be observed in}} the addition of the portico and porte-cochere. Inside the home, the dining room was enlarged with the addition of the semicircular bay on the mansion's north facade.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of a supercontinent can dramatically affect the environment. The collision of plates will result in mountain building, thereby shifting weather patterns.

Supercontinents can cause a drop in global temperatures and an increase in atmospheric oxygen. This, in turn, can affect the climate, further lowering temperatures.

The first aircraft to see all <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>changes</b> applied was the fourth prototype of the I-200.
