5|$|Significant {{action was}} taken along the Gulf Coast as the threat the storm posed, {{predicted}} to come ashore at Category Four strength, became more urgent. Over a half million people evacuated their homes in Texas and Louisiana, including everyone in Iberia Parish. A total of 200,000people evacuated in Louisiana. At least 2,000 volunteers staffed 115 Red Cross shelters in Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama. More than 20,000people stayed in those shelters. The Red Cross also sent over 160,000 meals to the area. A total of 3,000 prison inmates in Texas were evacuated to safer inland locations. The launch of Space Shuttle Atlantis was delayed for five days when the Kennedy Space Center was threatened by the storm, {{the first time a}} launch in Florida had been delayed because of weather in Houston.

25|$|Asda {{had also}} heavily {{increased}} prices across its ranges {{to try to}} offset growing operating costs and increase volume sales and margins which had narrowed within its stores, as a result customers deserted the chain in droves. This was compounded by problems with start-up costs and teething troubles with the new regional distribution depots. Computer systems taking restock orders from stores and then ordering goods, especially fresh food, from suppliers that were meant {{to come into the}} depots and then delivered on to the stores were not functioning properly, which meant stores ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> of some items for days at a time. That also meant that the company had to temporarily use manual ordering, which of course meant a loss of sales at stores and wastage costs that ran into tens of millions of pounds. Asda was entering a vicious circle with a flawed and compromised trading strategy and with a management team who were floundering and in charge of a company heading into a steady decline.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{pressing}} and often difficult jobs of a mashgiach, however, is the checking in and verification of shipments. The mashgiach must ensure that every food product that arrives at the facility has a reliable hekhsher before it is used. Suppliers often substitute products that are <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> with non-kosher products. Non-kosher establishments would generally not mind these substitutions. For a kosher establishment, however, these substitutions can cause major problems. If a product arrives without a hekhsher, the mashgiach must make sure the product is clearly marked as non-kosher and is not used, but returned to the supplier. Sometimes a product arrives that is purportedly kosher, but no hekhsher can be found. In this case, the mashgiach obtains a valid letter of certification from the certifying rabbi or kashrut agency, usually by contacting the manufacturer. In addition to checking hekhsherim, the mashgiach must also check that all meat products that arrive are double sealed, usually by inner and outer plastic bags or an inner plastic bag and a sealed box, and that all wine is kosher wine.|$|E

500|$|The {{transports}} {{always took}} off in daylight; weather reports were not available before dawn, and the fighter escort could not operate in darkness. Weather was a constant hazard over the Owen Stanley Range, and clouds could build up faster than an aircraft could climb. Poor flying weather, either over Port Moresby or over the target, could ground the transports {{for a week or}} more at a time. Weather and rough airstrips increased the amount of maintenance required to keep the planes flying. So too did the climate. The high humidity encouraged the growth of fungus which shorted out electrical components; metal surfaces were subject to corrosion; and lubrication oils evaporated in the high temperatures. Critical spare parts were often <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock,</b> and their delivery was an important role of the intra-theatre air transport. Availability did not just mean the transports; there was also the fighter escorts, which were normally based at another field. If they could not fly, or were required for another mission, then the transports could not fly. For planning purposes, a C-39 planeload was reckoned at [...] with [...] of fuel, while that of the larger C-53 was reckoned at [...] with [...] of fuel; but loading charts were not available in 1942, and aircraft were sometimes overloaded.|$|E
500|$|Post was {{released}} on 13 June 1995, as a 12" [...] record, CD, and compact cassette. It was issued on One Little Indian Records in the United Kingdom and Elektra Records in the United States and Canada; Polydor Records issued Post in Australia and Japan, also releasing the European edition of the album. Lead single [...] "Army of Me" [...] {{was released}} on 21 April 1995, shortly after the album's production concluded. It was released in the United Kingdom as two different CD releases, with [...] "Cover Me", [...] "You've Been Flirting Again", [...] "Sweet Intuition", and various remixes as its B-sides. It debuted at number 10 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming her first UK Top 10 single. Although it {{dropped out of the}} Top 20 the next week, [...] "Army of Me" [...] remained in the Top 75 for five weeks. The ending of [...] "Army of Me" [...] music video depicted Björk bombing an art museum, and due to a recent terrorist bombing in Oklahoma City, MTV removed it from its playlist before it even aired. Within weeks it was broadcast, although this [...] "foreshadowed a string of unlucky events that would further hinder Posts unveiling". An unsourced sample by Robin Rimbaud, prominently heard throughout [...] "Possibly Maybe", resulted in a lawsuit demanding a co-songwriter credit. After Rimbaud's label New Electronica refused Birkett's standard sample clearance compensation of £1,000, he and Björk resolved to destroy over 100,000 copies of the album, and [...] "remixing, remastering, and reprinting a new version". However, and at the request of Rimbaud, New Electronica later let Björk use his sample completely free of charge, meaning One Little Indian did not have to issue another version after all, since stores had yet to run <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> of Post initial run. Björk was also due back in court as a witness in Simon Fisher's lawsuit against Nellee Hooper and herself (regarding Debuts writing credits), charges that were eventually cleared by judge Robin Jacob. Author Mark Pytlik writes: [...] "The strange combination of events had conspired to form the strangest promotional tour anyone could have ever envisioned: in the week since Post had been released, Björk had seen her album deleted, her video banned, and two separate lawsuits brought against her". One Little Indian were also better prepared to promote the album, scheduling a string of European and American tour dates from the beginning of July into late August.|$|E
