5|$|A cancer-stricken Hadden, now in {{residence}} on the Mir space station, reveals to Arroway {{that a second}} machine was secretly made in Japan, and that Arroway {{will be the one}} to go. Outfitted with several recording devices, Arroway enters the machine's pod, which is then dropped into four rapidly spinning rings, causing the pod to apparently travel through a series of wormholes. Arroway sees a radio array-like structure at Vega and signs of an advanced civilization on another planet. She then finds herself on a beach, similar to a childhood picture she drew <b>of</b> <b>Florida,</b> <b>and</b> a figure approaches that becomes her deceased father. Arroway recognizes him as an alien taking her father's form and attempts to ask questions. The alien tells her that the familiar landscape and form were used to make their first contact easier for her and that this journey was just humanity's first step to joining other spacefaring species.|$|E

5|$|Although Disston's {{engineered}} canals aided {{water transport}} and steamboat traffic in Florida, he was ultimately unsuccessful in draining the Kissimmee River floodplain or lowering the surface water around Lake Okeechobee {{and in the}} Everglades. He was forced to sell much of his investments {{at a fraction of}} their original costs. However, his land purchase primed Florida's economy and allowed railroad magnates Henry Flagler and Henry Plant to build rail lines down the east coast <b>of</b> <b>Florida,</b> <b>and</b> another joining the west coast, which directly led to the domination of the tourist and citrus industries in Florida. Disston's immediate impact was in the Philadelphia area, where he was active in Republican politics and a philanthropist, but his legacy is often associated with the draining and development of Florida.|$|E

5|$|As Klaus was dissipating, a new {{cold low}} {{developed}} over Cuba and developed {{down to the}} surface as a tropical depression on October 9. The depression emerged the Straits <b>of</b> <b>Florida,</b> <b>and</b> quickly intensified into a tropical storm on October 10. After becoming a tropical storm, Marco steadily intensified and eventually peaked with winds of 65mph (100km/h). Marco headed towards Florida, and remained just offshore of the western coast and nearly made landfall near St. Petersburg, Florida on October 12. However, Marco continued to interact with land, and weakened to a tropical depression before actually making landfall near Cedar Key, Florida with winds of 35mph (55km/h). It rapidly weakened over land, and dissipated in Georgia later that day. Although it had dissipated, Marco added to the heavy rainfall already brought to the southeastern states by the remnants Hurricane Klaus.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary body {{piercing}} studios generally take numerous precautions {{to protect the}} health of the person being pierced and the piercer. Piercers are expected to sanitize the location to be pierced as well as their hands, even though they will often wear gloves during the procedure (and in some areas must, as it is prescribed by law). Quite frequently, these gloves will be changed multiple times, often one pair for each step of setup to avoid cross contamination. For example, after a piercer wearing gloves has cleaned the area to be pierced on a client, the piercer may change gloves to avoid recontaminating the area. Wearing sterile gloves is required by law for professional piercing procedures in some areas, such as the states <b>of</b> <b>Florida</b> <b>and</b> South Carolina. Tools and jewellery should be sterilized in autoclaves, and non-autoclavable surfaces should be cleaned with disinfectant agents on a regular basis and between clients.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of systems that developed, only one {{tropical}} cyclone, the second hurricane, managed to make landfall during the season. It severely impacted areas of the Greater Antilles, particularly the Dominican Republic, before making subsequent landfalls on Cuba and the U.S. states <b>of</b> <b>Florida</b> <b>and</b> North Carolina, with less severe effects. The estimated 2,000 to 8,000deaths caused by the storm in the Dominican Republic alone ranked it as one of the deadliest Atlantic hurricanes in recorded history. No other storms affected any landmasses during the year, although the first storm damaged a cruise ship in open waters.|$|E
