25|$|Defector role: an <b>organizational</b> {{participant}} negotiates exit {{primarily with}} <b>organizational</b> authorities, who grant permission for role relinquishment, control the exit process, and facilitate role transmission.

25|$|An <b>organizational</b> {{structure}} defines how {{activities such}} as task allocation, coordination and supervision are directed toward the achievement of <b>organizational</b> aims.

25|$|The set <b>organizational</b> {{structure}} may not {{coincide with}} facts, evolving in operational action. Such divergence decreases performance, when growing. E.g., a wrong <b>organizational</b> structure may hamper cooperation and thus hinder {{the completion of}} orders in due time and within limits of resources and budgets. <b>Organizational</b> structures should be adaptive to process requirements, aiming to optimize the ratio of effort and input to output.|$|E
25|$|Theories about inertia {{and change}} are {{fundamental}} to the research program of <b>organizational</b> ecology, which seeks {{a better understanding of}} the broader changes in the <b>organizational</b> landscape. Given the limits on firm-level adaptation, most of these broader changes thus come from the entry and selective replacement of organizations. Hence <b>organizational</b> ecology has spent considerable effort on understanding the founding and mortality rates of organizations.|$|E

25|$|A {{functional}} <b>organizational</b> {{structure is}} {{a structure that}} consists of activities such as coordination, supervision and task allocation. The <b>organizational</b> structure determines how the organization performs or operates. The term <b>organizational</b> structure refers to how the people in an organization are grouped and to whom they report. One traditional way of organizing people is by function. Some common functions within an organization include production, marketing, human resources, and accounting.|$|E
25|$|<b>Organizational</b> ecology is {{concerned}} with the capacity of the environment to support organizations and the rate of growth and decline of organizations within the environment. Each of these forces is a part of what is called <b>Organizational</b> Mortality.|$|E
25|$|A {{combination}} of <b>organizational</b> change and stress management {{is often the}} most useful approach for preventing stress at work. Both organizations and employees can employ strategies at <b>organizational</b> and individual levels. Generally, <b>organizational</b> level strategies include job procedure modification and employee assistance programs (EAP). Individual level strategies include taking vacation. Getting a realistic job preview to understand the normal workload and schedules of the job will also help people to identify {{whether or not the}} job fit them.|$|E
25|$|Simon saw two {{universal}} {{elements of}} human social behavior as key to creating {{the possibility of}} <b>organizational</b> behavior in human individuals: Authority (addressed in Chapter VII—The Role of Authority) and in Loyalties and Identification (Addressed in Chapter X: Loyalties, and <b>Organizational</b> Identification).|$|E
25|$|<b>Organizational</b> {{culture has}} been {{described}} as a set of assumptions shared by individuals in an organization; the assumptions influence the interpretation and actions that define appropriate behavior for various situations. <b>Organizational</b> {{culture has been}} shown to affect important <b>organizational</b> outcomes such as performance, attraction, recruitment, retention, employee satisfaction, and employee well-being. There are three levels of <b>organizational</b> culture: artifacts, shared values, and basic beliefs and assumptions. Artifacts comprise the physical components of the organization that relay cultural meaning. Shared values are individuals' preferences regarding certain aspects of the organization's culture (e.g., loyalty, customer service). Basic beliefs and assumptions include individuals' impressions about the trustworthiness and supportiveness of an organization, and are often deeply ingrained within the organization's culture.|$|E

25|$|A human-built {{system with}} complex {{behavior}} is often organized as a hierarchy. For example, a command hierarchy has among its notable features the <b>organizational</b> chart of superiors, subordinates, and lines of <b>organizational</b> communication. Hierarchical control systems are organized similarly {{to divide the}} decision making responsibility.|$|E
25|$|Taft was {{and remains}} a {{well-known}} and highly respected labor historian. His The Structure and Government of Labor Unions {{was the first}} work to rigorously detail the <b>organizational</b> structure and governance practices of American labor unions, and is considered a fine application of <b>organizational</b> theory to labor unions.|$|E
25|$|Teams also {{function}} in dynamic multi-team environments. Teams often must respond to shifting <b>organizational</b> contingencies. Contingencies affecting teams include constraints arising from {{conditions in which}} <b>organizational</b> resources are not exclusively earmarked for certain teams. When resources are scarce, they must be shared by multiple teams.|$|E
25|$|<b>Organizational</b> dissent {{begins with}} a {{triggering}} event. This triggering event is what propels individuals to speak out and share their opinions about <b>organizational</b> practices or politics. An individual will consider the issue of dissent and whom it concerns before deciding what dissent strategy to use. The types of issues that cause employees to dissent vary. The majority of employees expressed dissent due to resistance of <b>organizational</b> change. Other factors include employee treatment, decision making tactics, inefficiency, role/responsibility, resources, ethics, performance evaluations, and preventing harm (Kassing, 2002).|$|E
25|$|<b>Organizational</b> ecology {{has over}} the years {{become one of the}} central fields in <b>organizational</b> studies, and is known for its empirical, {{quantitative}} character. Ecological studies usually have a large-scale, longitudinal focus (datasets often span several decades, sometimes even centuries). The books The Demography of Corporations and Industries by Glenn Carroll and Michael Hannan (2000) and Logics of Organization Theory: Audiences, Codes, and Ecologies by Michael Hannan, Laszlo Polos, and Glenn Carroll (2007), provide the most comprehensive overview of the various theories and methods in <b>organizational</b> ecology.|$|E
25|$|<b>Organizational</b> {{justice is}} {{conceptualized}} as a multidimensional construct. The four proposed components are distributive, procedural, interpersonal, and informational justice. Research also suggests {{the importance of}} affect and emotion in the appraisal of the fairness of a situation as well as one's behavioral and attitudinal reactions to the situation (e.g., Barsky, Kaplan, & Beal, 2011). Much literature in the industrial/organizational psychology field has examined <b>organizational</b> justice {{as well as the}} associated outcomes. Perceptions of justice influence many key <b>organizational</b> outcomes such as motivation (Latham & Pinder, 2005) and job satisfaction (Al-Zu'bi, 2010).|$|E

25|$|In the 21st century, <b>organizational</b> theorists such as Lim, Griffiths, and Sambrook (2010) {{are once}} again proposing that <b>organizational</b> {{structure}} development is very much dependent on {{the expression of the}} strategies and behavior of the management and the workers as constrained by the power distribution between them, and influenced by their environment and the outcome.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, social psychologists, <b>organizational</b> scientists, and {{management}} scientists who conduct extensive {{research on the}} factors that influence creativity and innovation in teams and organizations have developed integrative theoretical models that emphasize the roles of team composition, team processes, and <b>organizational</b> culture, as well as the mutually reinforcing relationships between them in promoting innovation.|$|E
