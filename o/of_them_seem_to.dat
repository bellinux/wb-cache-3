5|$|A Great Eruption event {{similar to}} Eta Carinae A's {{has only been}} {{observed}} in one other star in the Milky Way—P Cygni—and {{in a handful of}} other possible LBVs in external galaxies. None <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be quite as violent as Eta Carinae's. It is unclear if this is something that only a very few of the most massive LBVs undergo, something that is caused by a close companion star, or a very brief but common phase for massive stars. Some similar events in external galaxies have been mistaken for supernovae and have been called supernova impostors, although this grouping may also include other types of non-terminal transients that approach the brightness of a supernova.|$|E
25|$|The letter {{names are}} {{recorded}} in a 9th-century manuscript of Alcuin (Codex Vindobonensis 795). Most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be Gothic forms of names also {{appearing in the}} rune poems. The names are given in their attested forms followed by the reconstructed Gothic forms and their meanings.|$|E

All <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> {{be very happy}} for Ryan and Greenlee. After receiving a call from David, Erica convinces Greenlee to confront David and get the divorce papers signed. Later, Greenlee confronts David, who notices {{she is wearing a}} ring, one that he had not given to her. After talking with David and revealing that she is now engaged to Ryan, she convinces David to sign the divorce papers.|$|E

500|$|Most of {{the lyrics}} in Foo Fighters are {{nonsensical}} lines written by Grohl in the 20 minutes before recording began. As the frontman, Grohl explained, [...] "I had seven days to record fifteen songs. I was just concentrating on everything being as together as possible, having everything be tight and in sync. There wasn't too much time spent {{sitting in a chair}} thinking." [...] Grohl would add that the gibberish was deliberate, given that, [...] "there was too much to say," [...] following Cobain's death and, [...] "a lot of emphasis placed on the meaning of the first Foo Fighters album." [...] Grohl still considered that [...] "the things you write down spur of the moment are most revealing. Now I look at them and some <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> actually have meaning", and revealed that a few songs have lyrics inspired by [...] "personal experiences of {{the last four or five}} years", with the standout being [...] "Big Me", an [...] "out-and-out love song" [...] to Grohl's then-wife Jennifer Youngblood that he described as his favorite track on the album. Contrasting with the aggressive and rebellious themes of Nirvana, Grohl had positive and cheery tunes such as [...] "This Is a Call", defined as [...] "a 'hello' and a 'thank you'" [...] to everyone that had played a key role in Grohl's life; the playful [...] "For All the Cows"; and [...] "Wattershed", with a title referencing Mike Watt and lyrics that described Grohl's [...] "love of hardcore and old school punk rock".|$|E

In {{a letter}} to Lucy Stone, Anthony said, [...] "The Men, even the best <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> think the Women's Rights question should be waived for the present.

2500|$|The {{second section}} gives {{the names of}} the populi Albenses. These were local {{communities}} inhabiting the region of Mons Albanus (now Monte Cavo) and its immediate surroundings, the Alban Hills. Only some <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have reached the urban stage and the list reflects the typical archaic Bronze Age organization of [...] human settlement: sparse, polycentric and gravitating around a religious centre, in this case the sanctuary of Iuppiter Latiaris. The exact location of these settlements is unknown with a few exceptions: Aesulae, Pedum, Fidenae, Politorium, Bovillae, and Tolerium. It is possible that the Latinienses were settlers of the Ager Latiniensis, i. e. the area near Laurentum and Lavinium, and that the Foreti were actually settlers of the area later occupied by the Roman Forum. The Querquetulani, however, were certainly not the settlers of the Querquetulan (i.e. Caelian [...] ) Hill in Rome as they are mentioned by Dionysius in the list of Latin peoples who went to war against Rome in 495.|$|E

2500|$|Pope Urban II {{planned the}} {{departure}} of the crusade for 15 August 1096; a number of unexpected bands of peasants and low-ranking knights organized and set off for Jerusalem on their own. The peasant population had been afflicted by drought, famine, and disease for many years before 1096, and some <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have envisioned the crusade as an escape from these hardships. Spurring them on had been a number of meteorological occurrences beginning in 1095 that seemed to be a divine blessing for the movement: a meteor shower, aurorae, a lunar eclipse, and a comet, among other events. An outbreak of ergotism had also occurred just before the Council of Clermont. Millenarianism, the belief {{that the end of the}} world was imminent, popular in the early 11th century, experienced a resurgence in popularity. The response was beyond expectations: while Urban might have expected a few thousand knights, he ended up with a migration numbering up to 100,000 Crusaders of mostly unskilled fighters, including women and children.|$|E
2500|$|Another semi-negative {{response}} to the poem followed on 4 January 1808 in the Eclectic Review. The writer, James Montgomery, attacked the 1807 collection of poems for depicting low subjects. When {{it came to the}} ode, Montgomery attacked the poem for depicting pre-existence. After quoting the poem with extracts from the whole collection, he claimed, [...] "We need insist no more on the necessity of using, in poetry, a language different from and superior to 'the real language of men,' since Mr. Wordsworth himself is so frequently compelled to employ it, for the expression of thoughts which without it would be incommunicable. These volumes are distinguished by the same blemishes and beauties as were found in their predecessors, but in an inverse proportion: the defects of the poet, in this performance, being as much greater than his merits, as they were less in his former publication." [...] In his conclusion, Montgomery returned to the ode and claimed, that [...] "the reader is turned loose into a wilderness of sublimity, tenderness, bombast, and absurdity, to find out the subject as well as he can... After our preliminary remarks on Mr. Wordsworth's theory of poetical language, and the quotations which we have given from these and his earlier compositions, it will be unnecessary to offer any further estimate or character of his genius. We shall only add one remark.... Of the pieces now published he has said nothing: most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have been written for no purpose at all, and certainly to no good one." [...] In January 1815, Montgomery returned to Wordsworth's poetry in another review and argues, [...] "Mr. Wordsworth often speaks in ecstatic strains of the pleasure of infancy. If we rightly understand him, he conjectures that the soul comes immediately from a world of pure felicity, when it is born into this troublous scene of care and vicissitude... This brilliant allegory, (for such we must regard it,) is employed to illustrate the mournful truth, that looking back from middle age to the earliest period of remembrance we find, 'That there hath pass'd away a glory from the earth,'... Such is Life".|$|E
