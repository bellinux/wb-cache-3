40|$|<b>On-call</b> working <b>time</b> {{arrangements}} are increasingly common, involve work {{only in the}} event of an unpredictable incident and exist primarily outside of standard hours. Like other non-standard working <b>time</b> arrangements, <b>on-call</b> work disrupts sleep and can therefore have negative effects on health, safety and performance. Unlike other non-standard working <b>time</b> arrangements, <b>on-call</b> work often allows sleep opportunities between calls. Any sleep obtained during on-call periods will be beneficial for waking performance. However, there is evidence that sleep while on call may be of substantially reduced restorative value because of the expectation of receiving the call and apprehension about missing the call. In turn, waking from sleep to respond to a call may be associated with temporary increases in performance impairment. This is dependent on characteristics of both the preceding sleep, the tasks required upon waking and the availability and utility of any countermeasures to support the transition from sleep to wake. In this paper, we critically evaluate the evidence both for and against sleeping during on-call periods and conclude that some sleep, even if it is of reduced quality and broken by repeated calls, is a good strategy. We also note, however, that organisations utilising <b>on-call</b> working <b>time</b> arrangements need to systematically manage the likelihood that on-call sleep can be associated with temporary performance impairments upon waking. Given that the majority of work in this area has been laboratory-based, there is a significant need for field-based investigations of the magnitude of sleep inertia, in addition to the utility of sleep inertia countermeasures. Field studies should include working with subject matter experts to identify the real-world impacts of changes in performance associated with sleeping, or not sleeping, whilst on call...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{workload}} {{study of}} consultants in palliative medicine was carried out, {{in which a}} task inventory questionnaire {{was sent to the}} consultant members of the Association for Palliative Medicine of Great Britain and Ireland. The median number of hours per week worked by a palliative medicine consultant was 49. 5 (mean 51. 3), excluding <b>time</b> <b>on-call</b> and breaks. The median consultant first on-call roat is 1 : 3. Palliative medicine consultants work a median of 22. 5 direct clinical and 4. 5 indirect clinical hours per week. This is very similar to the hours worked by consultants in other specialties who work an average 51. 3 h per week, but with a median on-call rota of 1 : 6. Further studies are planned to monitor the pattterns of consultant activity and workload in this specialty.

40|$|Every year Lutheran clergy resign {{pastoral}} calls citing one, primary reason: burnout. Certainly, {{the demands}} of pastoral call within a congregation are easy to observe: long <b>on-call</b> periods of <b>time,</b> intense levels of pastoral care needs, and navigating multifaceted, interpersonal relationships, to name a few. While these demands become symptomatic {{to the problem of}} burnout, the determining cause is still unknown, especially given the various contextual factors for these pastors. Yet, the number of pastors leaving ministry or experiencing shortened tenures is alarming. In the Lutheran church, spiritual formation language is often associated with determined deficiencies. Other times, spiritual formation is viewed with less value than Biblical and theological knowledge. Historical and theological evidence is recorded giving credence to the reality that spiritual formation {{has been part of the}} ecology of Lutheranism since it’s conception. As example, Martin Luther supported the need for of formation for the family and the pastor. Through Scripture, Lutheran theology, and qualitative research, this study intends to reveal the importance of spiritual formation for those in a pastoral call. Chapter One offers insight into the problem of deficient spiritual formation and the consequences. Chapter Two relies on Biblical support to better define the role of the pastor for the sake of God’s ministry and the church. In addition, Lutheran theology illustrates the nature of pastoral ministry. Chapter Three explores some of the current solutions being proposed to address the problem of deficient Spiritual Formation. Chapter Four will give support to the solutions proposed by the author Chapter Five will highlight the tangible practice of one of the solutions suggested, that of Sabbath. Chapter Six summarizes key elements and invites further study to address the issue of deficient Spiritual Formation and ideally create a path to healthy clergy for the sake of the future church...|$|R
5000|$|In the United Kingdom, {{under the}} National Minimum Wage Act 1998, workers {{operating}} under a zero-hour contract on stand-by time, <b>on-call</b> <b>time,</b> and downtime {{must be paid}} the national minimum wage for hours worked. Prior {{to the introduction of}} the Working Time Regulations 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations 1999 zero-hour contracts were sometimes used to [...] "clock-off" [...] staff during quiet periods while retaining them on site so they could be returned to paid work should the need arise. The National Minimum Wage Regulations now require that employers pay the national minimum wage for the time workers are required to be at the workplace even if there is no [...] "work" [...] to do. In the past, some employees working on a zero-hour contract have [...] been told that they are required to obtain permission of their employer before accepting other work but this practise has now been banned under UK legislation enacted in May 2015. In , the UK Supreme Court delivered a groundbreaking judgment on workers who were on a zero hour contract. Lord Clarke held, at paragraph 35, that in employment relations which are characterised by inequality of bargaining power, the written terms of a contract may not in truth represent what was the contract in law. In 2013, the reasoning in Autoclenz was applied by Supperstone J in the Employment Appeal Tribunal to hold that a security guard who was given a zero hours contract was entitled to a stable working pattern: the contract's written terms were invalid. Together, this indicates that all zero hours contracts may be unlawful, and workers may be entitled to sue their employers for an unlawful deduction of wages if they are willing and able to work.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Subspecialisation within {{general surgery}} has today reached further than ever. However, <b>on-call</b> <b>time,</b> an {{unchanged}} need for broad surgical skills {{are required to}} meet the demands of acute surgical disease and trauma. The introduction of a new subspecialty in North America that deals solely with acute care surgery and trauma is an attempt to offer properly trained surgeons also during <b>on-call</b> <b>time.</b> To find out whether such a subspecialty could be helpful in Sweden we analyzed our workload for emergency surgery and trauma. METHODS: Linkoping University Hospital serves a population of 257 000. Data from 2010 for all patients, diagnoses, times and types of operations, surgeons involved, duration of stay, types of injury and deaths regarding emergency procedures were extracted from a prospectively-collected database and analyzed. RESULTS: There were 2362 admissions, 1559 emergency interventions; 835 were mainly abdominal operations, and 724 diagnostic or therapeutic endoscopies. Of the 1559 emergency interventions, 641 (41. 1 %) were made outside office hours, and of 453 minor or intermediate procedures (including appendicectomy, cholecystectomy, or proctological procedures) 276 (60. 9 %) were done during the evenings or at night. Two hundred and fifty-four patients were admitted with trauma and 29 (11. 4 %) required operation, of whom general surgeons operated on eight (3. 1 %). Thirteen consultants and 11 senior registrars were involved in 138 bowel resections and 164 cholecystectomies chosen as index operations for standard emergency surgery. The median (range) number of such operations done by each consultant was 6 (3 [...] 17) and 6 (1 [...] 22). Corresponding figures for senior registrars were 7 (0 [...] 11) and 8 (1 [...] 39). CONCLUSION: There was an uneven distribution of exposure to acute surgical problems and trauma among general surgeons. Some were exposed to only a few standard emergency interventions and most surgeons did not operate on a single patient with trauma. Further centralization of trauma care, long-term positions at units for emergency surgery and trauma, and subspecialisation in the fields of emergency surgery and trauma, might be options to solve problems of low volumes...|$|E
40|$|In summary, the {{two major}} facts that have emerged from {{a year and a}} half of {{experience}} with 405 regulations are shown in Table VI. The increased staffing with the monies made available has greatly enhanced patient care and decreased the resident workload. I want to again compliment Dr. Axelrod for the foresight to make these funds available despite adverse criticism. He clearly understood that the changes needed were quite expensive because the problems are primarily economic in origin. What type of paramedical personnel are needed is yet uncertain. I mentioned briefly earlier that the "data manager" combines an excellent administrative secretary and a nurse. The simple institution of electronic data processing can, surprisingly enough, worsen the problem rather than help. For example, institution of a beeper system, making it possible for anyone to "beep" a house officer at any time, resulted in an astonishing increase in "beeper frequency," a house officer receiving seven or eight such messages per hour, 24 hours a day, rather than communicating by other methods. Such "instant" communication can become a serious hazard rather than a help. Second, as repeatedly mentioned, the <b>on-call</b> <b>time</b> concept is crucial, permitting flexibility that avoids fatigue and yet maintains continuity of care. Otherwise there is a real danger with a rigid time-on/time-off schedule...|$|E
40|$|Objective follow-through {{experiences}} (which enable midwifery {{students to}} experience {{continuity of care}} with individual women through pregnancy, labour and birth and the postnatal period) are a component of midwifery education programmes in Australia and the United Kingdom. Current accreditation standards in Australia require midwifery students to have a total of 20 continuity of care experiences {{with an average of}} 20 hours per woman over the duration of their course. There has been limited research regarding students’ and academics’ experiences of follow-through experiences; and there has been debate regarding the appropriate number of follow-through experiences in midwifery curricula. This study aimed to explore the follow-through experience from the perspective of midwifery students and academics in Victoria, Australia. Design cross-sectional design using a web-based survey. Setting Victoria, Australia. Participants students (n= 401) and academics (n= 35) from all seven universities in Victoria that offer accredited midwifery programmes including the Bachelor of Midwifery, Bachelor of Nursing/Bachelor of Midwifery double degree, Postgraduate Diploma of Midwifery and Masters of Midwifery (entry to practice). Findings students and academics were in agreement that continuity of care is important to women. They considered the follow-through experience to be a unique and valuable learning opportunity and agreed that follow-through experiences should be included in midwifery education programmes. However, students and academics raised major concerns about the impact of follow-through experiences on students’ capacity to meet university course requirements (such as missing lectures/tutorials and clinical placements), and spending extensive periods of <b>time</b> <b>on-call</b> both within and outside the university semester. Students and academics also reported concerns about the impact of follow-through experiences on students’ personal lives, including paid employment and family responsibilities (such as childcare or caring for family members). Key conclusions and implications for practice in settings where continuity of care options for women are relatively limited, prescriptive requirements regarding the number and hours of follow-through experiences can present significant challenges for midwifery students.

40|$|Background: Poorly functioning, time-consuming, and {{inadequate}} information systems {{are among the}} most important work-related psychosocial factors causing stress in physicians. The present study examined the trend in the perceived stress that was related to information systems (SRIS) among Finnish physicians during a nine-year follow-up. In addition, we examined the associations of gender, age, employment sector, specialization status, leadership position, <b>on-call</b> burden, and <b>time</b> pressure with SRIS change and levels. Methods: A longitudinal design with three survey data collection waves (2006, 2010 and 2015) based on a random sample of Finnish physicians in 2006 was used. The study sample included 1095 physicians (62. 3 % women, mean age 54. 4 years) who provided data on SRIS in every wave. GLM repeated measures analyses were used to examine the associations between independent variables and the SRIS trend during the years 2006, 2010, and 2015. Results: SRIS increased during the study period. The estimated marginal mean of SRIS in 2006 was 2. 80 (95 % CI = 2. 68 - 2. 92) and the mean increase was 0. 46 (95 % CI = 0. 30 - 0. 61) points from 2006 to 2010 and 0. 25 (95 % CI = 0. 11 - 0. 39) points from 2010 to 2015. Moreover, our results show that the increase was most pronounced in primary care, whereas in hospitals SRIS did not increase between 2010 and 2015. SRIS increased more among those in a leadership position. On-call duties and high time-pressures were associated with higher SRIS levels during all waves. Conclusions: Changing, difficult, and poorly functioning information systems (IS) are a prominent source of stress among Finnish physicians and this perceived stress continues to increase. Organizations should implement arrangements to ease stress stemming from IS especially for those with a high workload and on-call or leadership duties. To decrease IS-related stress, it would be important to study in more detail the main IS factors that contribute to SRIS. Earlier studies indicate that the usability and stability of information systems as well as end-user involvement in system development and work-procedure planning may be significant factors...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. This year, the World Health Organization {{focuses on}} {{restoring}} {{dignity and respect}} to health care workers. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the workplace stressors in physicians. Material and Methods. The present study was performed in the period 2002 - 2004, among physicians treated in the Health Center Novi Sad. The examinees were asked to fill out a questionnaire - a workplace survey - to identify workplace stressors by using a self-evaluation method. The physicians were divided into three groups: those practicing surgery (S), internal medicine (IM) and preventive-diagnostics (PD). Statistical analysis was done using SPSS and STATISTICA software. The sample included 208 physicians with an average age of 40 years (SD= 7, 1); average work experience of 22 years (SD= 8, 1). Results. 65 physicians from group S and 108 physicians from group IM, identified the following workplace stressors: treating patients in life-threatening situations (47. 7 %, 30. 6 %, respectfully); on-call duty (13. 8 %, 12 %); low salary (10. 8 %, 10. 2 %); limited diagnostic and therapeutic resources in the IM group. 35 physicians from the DP group identified the following stressors: low salary (25 %), treating patients in life-threatening situations and a great number of patients (16 %). The analysis of all examined physicians revealed the following workplace stressors: treating patients in life-threatening situations (34. 6 %), low salary (13 %), on-call duty and overtime, and too many patients per physician (11. 5 %). Conclusion. Restoring the reputation of health workers can be done by providing new equipment to resolve life-threatening situations, by increasing salaries, reducing <b>on-call</b> <b>time,</b> as well as the number of patients. Generally speaking, this should help to improve the quality of work in the health care system, in accordance with the recommendations of the WHO. ...|$|E

As infecÃÃes {{hospital}}ares constituem risco significativo Ã saÃde dos usuÃrios, e dentre estas, a infecÃÃo de corrente sanguÃnea relacionada ao cateter venoso central, dada a mortalidade a ela associada, especialmente quando acomete pacientes graves, internados em Unidade de Terapia Intensiva (UTI). Assim, este estudo objetivou avaliar a conformidade e nÃo conformidade das prÃticas de prevenÃÃo de infecÃÃo de corrente sanguÃnea relacionada ao cateter venoso central de curta permanÃncia (ICS-ACVC), por meio de indicadores clÃnicos em uma Unidade de Terapia Intensiva. Trata-se de um estudo observacional, seccional, com abordagem quantitativa, estruturado a partir do âmanual de avaliaÃÃo das prÃticas de controle e prevenÃÃo de infecÃÃo hospitalarâ, realizado em um hospital da rede privada da cidade de Fortaleza/CearÃ. O universo do estudo foi composto pelas oportunidades de avaliaÃÃo das prÃticas selecionadas, realizadas pelos profissionais de saÃde (mÃdicos e profissionais de enfermagem) em pacientes internados na Unidade de Terapia Intensiva da instituiÃÃo e que passaram pelo procedimento de inserÃÃo do cateter venoso central de curta permanÃncia. A amostra baseou-se na conformidade esperada de 80 %, com 2064 avaliaÃÃes distribuÃdas entre as prÃticas selecionadas, realizadas por meio da observaÃÃo direta ou registro em prontuÃrios. De acordo com os resultados encontrados, o indicador CSPI apresenta maior Ãndice de conformidade geral (62, 5 %), em seguida o indicador CSCM apresenta conformidade geral inferior Ã ideal, com apenas 45 %, entretanto, quando analisado cada item que compÃe este indicador, pode-se observar que essa inferioridade deve-se principalmente Ã nÃo realizaÃÃo da prÃticas de desinfecÃÃo de hubs e conectores com clorexidine 0, 5 % (17, 5 %) e troca de equipos e transdutores conforme recomendaÃÃo (13, 5 %). O indicador CSQI apresentou conformidade geral baixa (12, 5 %), devido Ã nÃo conformidade de algumas prÃticas como: uso de campo estÃril ampliado no momento de instalaÃÃo do cateter (30 %) e o uso de antissÃptico de veÃculo alcoÃlico para preparo da pele antes da punÃÃo (37, 5 %). JÃ o indicador HMSEL apresentou Ãndice de conformidade geral nulo. Conclui-se que, embora a avaliaÃÃo das prÃticas de registro de indicaÃÃo, tempo de permanÃncia, inserÃÃo percutÃnea, presenÃa de curativo oclusivo apÃs inserÃÃo do cateter, registro e periodicidade da troca do curativo do cateter tenham atingido conformidade similar ou superior Ã esperada de 80 %, as demais prÃticas precisam de uma nova elaboraÃÃo de estratÃgias que assegurem a adesÃo duradoura das prÃticas de controle e prevenÃÃo de ICS-ACVC, associada Ã anÃlise contÃnua de condiÃÃes de trabalho e disponibilidade de material.

Hospital-acquired infections pose significant risk to the health of users, and among these, bloodstream infection central venous catheter-related, given the associated mortality, especially when it involves serious patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU). Thus, this study aimed to evaluate compliance and non-compliance of practices for the prevention of infection of the bloodstream of central venous catheter related sojourn (ICS-ACVC), through clinical indicators in a therapy unit Intensive. This is an observational study, sectional, with quantitative approach, structured from the "Handbook of practical assessment of hospital infection control and prevention", held in a private network hospital of Fortaleza/CearÃ. The universe of study was composed of selected practices assessment opportunities, conducted by health professionals (doctors and nursing professionals) in patients hospitalized {{in the intensive care unit}} of the institution and who went through the procedure of central venous catheter insertion of sojourn. The sample was based on expected 80 % compliance with 2064 evaluations distributed among selected practices, carried out by means of direct observation or record in charts. According to the results, the CSPI, indicator presents greater overall compliance index (62. 5 %), then the CSCM indicator, presents general compliance less than ideal, with only 45 %, however when analysed each item that makes up this indicator it can be observed that this inferiority is mainly the non-realization of the practice of disinfection of hubs and connectors with 0. 5 % (17. 5 %) also and exchange of equipment and transducers as recommendation (13. 5 %). The CSQI indicator, presented general compliance low (12. 5 %), due to non-compliance of some practices such as: use of sterile field expanded at the time of installation of the catheter (30 %) and the use of antiseptic of vehicle alcohol for skin preparation before the LP (37. 5 %). Already the HMSEL indicator presented general compliance index null. It is concluded that, although the evaluation of registration practices, <b>on-call</b> <b>time,</b> percutaneous insertion, presence of Occlusive dressing after catheter insertion, registry and periodicity curative catheter Exchange have reached compliance similar to or greater than 80 % expected, other practices need a new elaboration of strategies that ensure lasting adhesion control practices and prevention of ICS-ACVC, associated with the analysis continues working conditions and availability of material...|$|E
