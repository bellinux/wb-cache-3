25|$|The naiads are top predators {{in their}} aquatic habitats, feeding on the larvae of {{mosquitoes}} and other flies, tadpoles, and the naiads {{of their own}} and other <b>odonate</b> species.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} damselflies, the young—known as naiads, nymphs, or larvae—are carnivorous. The most {{ubiquitous}} prey {{in the tree}} holes they inhabit are mosquito larvae, but they will also feed on tadpoles, syrphid fly and chironomid fly larvae, and other <b>odonate</b> (dragonfly and damselfly) naiads. The three leaflike caudal lamellae {{at the end of}} the abdomen, which serve as gills, are broad and elaborately folded, an adaptation to intermittent low oxygen availability in its habitat. Each lamella has a conspicuous white spot, making Megaloprepus easy to distinguish from other tree-hole damselflies.|$|E
25|$|The {{trochanter}} is the basal {{segment of}} the telopodite; {{it is always a}} small segment in the insect leg, freely movable by a horizontal hinge on the coxa, but more or less fixed {{to the base of the}} femur. When movable on the femur the trochantero femoral hinge is usually vertical or oblique in a vertical plane, giving a slight movement of production and reduction at the joint, though only a reductor muscle is present. In the Odonata, both nymphs and adults, there are two trochanteral segments, but they are not movable on each other; the second contains the reductor muscle of the femur. The usual single trochanteral segment of insects, therefore, probably represents the two trochanters of other arthropods fused into one apparent segment, since it is not likely that the primary coxotrochanteral hinge has been lost from the leg. In some of the Hymenoptera a basal subdivision of the femur simulates a second trochanter, but the insertion of the reductor muscle on its base attests that it belongs to the femoral segment, since as shown in the <b>odonate</b> leg, the reductor has its origin in the true second trochanter.|$|E

50|$|<b>Odonates</b> {{are found}} {{on all the}} continents except Antarctica. Although some species of {{dragonfly}} have wide distributions, damselflies tend to have smaller ranges. Most <b>odonates</b> breed in fresh-water; a few damselflies in the family Caenagrionidae breed in brackish water (and a single dragonfly species breeds in seawater). Dragonflies are more affected by pollution than are damselflies. The presence of <b>odonates</b> indicates that an ecosystem is of good quality.

50|$|The word {{dragonfly}} is {{also sometimes}} {{used to refer}} to all Odonata, but <b>odonate</b> is a more correct English name for the group as a whole.

50|$|One {{study of}} the gut {{contents}} of wild-caught bantam sunfish revealed a diverse diet dominated by gastropods, <b>odonate</b> larvae, and micro-crustaceans. Bantam sunfish individuals of less than 21mm in length fed primarily upon aquatic Hemiptera, micro-crustaceans, and chironomids, while individuals of more than 40 mm in length commonly ate gastropods, amphipods, and larger dipteran larvae. Bantam sunfish of all size classes regularly consumed dragonfly larvae.|$|E
