5|$|In 2007, he {{starred in}} {{supporting}} roles in Year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dog</b> and Rendition. Year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dog</b> {{is a dark}} comedy about a lonely middle-aged woman, played by Molly Shannon, who finds that animals are the only beings she can truly rely on. Sarsgaard plays Newt, an androgynous dog trainer, and love interest for Shannon's character. He starred alongside Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin, Reese Witherspoon, and Jake Gyllenhaal in Rendition, a Gavin Hood-directed political thriller about the US policy of extraordinary rendition. Viewed as a sex symbol, Sarsgaard was named one of Salon.com's Sexiest Man Living in 2007. 2008 saw Sarsgaard star in the drama Elegy, based on a Phillip Roth novel, The Dying Animal. The film received favorable good reception amongst critics.|$|E
5|$|Many {{carnivorous}} marine gastropods {{are known}} predators of L.canarium, including the volutes Cymbiola nobilis and Melo melo and the cone snail (Conus textile). The dog conch is also preyed upon by vertebrates. These include the crab-eating macaque, Macaca fascicularis, an opportunistic predator that scours intertidal environments. Humans are one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> conch's main predators, subjecting the species to intensive fishing and exploitation.|$|E
5|$|The Cattle Dog breed {{standard}} {{states that it}} should have well-conditioned muscles, even when bred for companion or show purposes, and that its appearance should be symmetrical and balanced, with no individual part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> exaggerated.

5|$|Western artists often infused Euro-American {{characteristics}} in their depictions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>of</b> Polynesia and possibly many actually depicted <b>the</b> pet <b>dogs</b> kept on European ships rather than native breeds.

The drug appeared to be well tolerated by almost all <b>the</b> <b>dogs,</b> and only two developed clinical signs and biochemical evidence of hypoadrenocorticism. Polyuria and polydipsia completely resolved in 70 per cent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> that had these problems, and skin changes resolved in 62 per cent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> that had skin abnormalities. There was a significant reduction (P&# 60; 0. 001 in each case) in both the mean basal and post-adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) cortisol concentrations after a mean of 12. 3 days <b>of</b> treatment. <b>The</b> post-ACTH cortisol concentration decreased to less than 250 nmol/litre in 81 per cent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> within one month <b>of</b> <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> treatment and in another 15 per cent at some later time.

5|$|Under {{the show}} standard, {{there are several}} {{physical}} points which would be treated as faults in the show ring.

5|$|A {{study from}} 2008 {{indicates}} that sexual dimorphism occurs early during this species' ontogeny. L.canarium males reach sexual maturity at a shorter shell length {{when compared to}} females.

The maximum life span <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> conch differs between sexes; it is estimated at 2 and 2.5 years for females and males, respectively.|$|E

On 10 December 1907, 1,000 medical students marched through central London waving effigies of the brown dog on sticks, clashing with suffragettes, trade unionists and 400 police officers, {{one of a series of}} battles known as the Brown Dog riots.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to meat or fur hunts, {{there are also}} competition hunts to demonstrate the speed and skill <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog.</b> In these the raccoons are not killed, but are treed and released. Some of the largest competition hunts are the Grand American, Autumn Oaks, and Leafy Oaks. Coon hunting has been recorded in such books as Where the Red Fern Grows and popularized in stories and songs recorded by Jerry Clower, Jimmy Martin and others. In Alabama, there is a cemetery specifically for the burial of coonhounds.|$|E

5|$|Previous films by Hepworth and {{his company}} had been {{considered}} {{a continuation of the}} cinema of attractions.

The film is considered a step forward in both film grammar and structure.
