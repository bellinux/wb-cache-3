40|$|A {{possible}} {{mechanism of}} strain accommodation in large deformation <b>of</b> <b>glasses</b> is crystallization; deformation stability {{is a measure}} of the resistance <b>of</b> <b>glasses</b> to crystallization. We study the effect of atomic size ratio and atomic stiffness parameter (related to the curvature of the interatomic potential) on deformation stability <b>of</b> binary <b>glasses</b> using molecular static simulations. The deformation stability <b>of</b> a <b>glass</b> is found to increase with increasing atomic size ratio and magnitude of the atomic stiffness, which is proportional to the bulk modulus of the pure crystalline system, as well as the ratio of atomic stiffnesses of constituent atoms. To understand the role of the above parameters on deformation stability, misfit energies of randomly substituted solid solution fcc crystals and glasses are compared for various atomic size ratios and atomic stiffness values. Unlike in fcc solid solution, the misfit energy <b>of</b> binary <b>glasses</b> is found to be insensitive to the atomic size ratio. It is also found that the packing fraction <b>of</b> <b>glasses</b> is insensitive to the atomic size ratio, consistent with the above result. Beyond a critical atomic size ratio, the misfit energy of fcc solid solution exceeds the energy <b>of</b> the <b>glass,</b> thus making the amorphous state completely stable to deformation induced crystallization. Our analysis shows that critical atomic size ratio decreases with increasing atomic stiffness which leads to an increase in the deformation stability <b>of</b> <b>glasses...</b>|$|R

5|$|Because {{glass is}} very brittle in its solid state, {{it is often}} prone to {{cracking}} upon heating and cooling, especially if the heating and cooling are uneven. This is because the brittleness <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> {{does not allow for}} uneven thermal expansion. Glass that has been welded will usually need to be cooled very slowly and evenly through the glass transition, in a process called annealing, to relieve any internal stresses created by a temperature gradient.|$|E
