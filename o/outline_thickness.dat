40|$|In the Ajoie-Region, {{seven in}} situ {{collected}} species of ammonites helped {{to establish a}} new biostratigraphical an dlithological frame for the platform sediments of the Reuchenette Formation, i. e. eighteen closely spaced sections have been spliced by means of lithological, sedimentological, microfacial data and index-fossils (ammonites). Three marker beds achieved the exact lithological correlations between the outcrops corroborated by the vertical faciese changes. Based on the biostratigraphical data five 3 rd order sedimentary sequences could be asigned to the Late Oxfordian to Late Kimmeridgian time interval. The sequence boundaries lie within the Planula-, Platynota-, Divisum-, Acanthicum- and Eudoxus-Zone. The upper three 3 rd order sequences correspond to the Boreal sequences Kim 3 to Kim 5 of Hardenbol et al. (1998). The deduced "large-scale" sea level trend matches those from other Euoprean regions (Spain, Russia). At platform scale, this time control and further outcrops south of the Ajoie-Region, in combination with mineralostratigraphical and lithological marker beds, allowed the correlation and dating of the thickest sections - including the type-section - of the Reuchenette Formation and thus serve to oimprove the previously estimated ages of their sequence boundaries (see above). The variability of stacking pattern and facies between the sections also reveals distinct changes in facies evolution occurring across Late Palaeozoic basement structures and suggest synsedimentary differential subsidence. These sturctures acted as important controlling factors for the distribution of the sediments of the Reuchenette Formation besides the sea level fluctuations. The interplay of sea level changes and synsedimentary differential subsidence is <b>outlined</b> by lateral <b>thickness</b> variations and conspicuous laterally changing depositional environments. A close examination of these changes also sheds much light on the nature of platform topography in the transition area between the Paris Basin and the Tethys. During the Planula- to Divisum-Zone time interval the study area was a flat platform with a more or less uniform facies distribution, which connected the above-mentioned realms. During the Divisum- to Acanthicum-Zone time interval this platform changed into a pronounced basin-and-swell morphology with specific depositional environments and "separated" the Paris Basin from the Tethys. Dinosaurs might have used this boundary to traverse between the Central Massif and the London-Brabant Massif during sea level lowstands...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe « METYSS » cruise {{was carried}} out in June 2009 onboard the R/V « Téthys II » along the eastern Sardinian and {{south-eastern}} Corsican margins, western Tyrrhenian Sea, in order to better constrain the potential links between deformation related to either crustal tectonics or salt tectonics and sediment accumulation, especially during the Messinian and Plio-Quaternary times. We acquired 15 high-resolution seismic reflection profiles (about 1200 km in cumulative length) along the south-eastern Corsican margin, immediately north of the Bonifacio Strait and along the upper and middle parts of the eastern Sardinian margin, from the continental slope to the Cornaglia Terrace. The Tyrrhenian Sea is considered as a Neogene back-arc basin that opened during continental rifting and oceanic spreading related to the eastward migration of the Apennine subduction system from Tortonian to Pliocene times (Jolivet et al., 2006). Rifting of the Tyrrhenian Sea started first along the Eastern Sardinian margin during the Tortonian-Messinian times and therefore the series of that age should be considered as syn-rift sediments (Sartori et al., 2004). The « METYSS » seismic profiles clearly illustrate that this part of the Tyrrhenian was highly segmented during the rifting stage by N-S trending normal faults delineating ridges (e. g., Baronie Ridge) and basins (e. g., Sardinian Basin and Cornaglia Terrace), as previously described for example by Thommeret (1999) and Sartori et al. (2004). The Messinian sedimentary units and especially the « Upper Unit » (UU, Lofi et al., this congress, corresponding to the « Upper Evaporites » in the previous literature) are, without any doubt, of syn-rift age, as they display a fan-shaped stratal geometry. The Mobile Unit (MU, Lofi et al., this congress), i. e. the Messinian halite, is clearly imaged in the study area and its spatial repartition can be <b>outlined.</b> The highly-variable <b>thickness</b> of the confined salt basins could be due to the initial basin geometry (i. e. before the Messinian salinity Crisis) or to the syn-rift character of the deposition. Southeastward of the study area, {{in the vicinity of the}} Cornaglia Seamount, salt tectonics appears surprisingly vigorous. More surprisingly, several normal faults seem to have remained active in recent times, if not even at present time. Fault slip has been recorded by bathymetric scarps and associated footwall debris flows interfingered within the Plio-Quaternary sequence, even though the eastern Sardinian margin is usually considered to be passive now. Moreover, some amount of tectonic inversion is visible on some normal faults that show contractional or transpressional components of late slip. In addition, this “post-rift” deformation can be illustrated within the Plio-Quaternary sequence by a regional unconformity. Consequently, numerous mass-transport deposits and channel-levees systems observed in the Plio-Quaternary cover could be partly controlled by tectonic activity. These very preliminary results require further investigations in order to better decipher the role of crustal tectonics and salt tectonics, salt-related structures being very efficient markers to discriminate between the respective contribution of gravity-driven, salt tectonics and deep-seated, crustal tectonics (Gaullier et al., 2010). Finally, we aim to precisely determine the relative vertical movements (tilting, subsidence, magmatism...) and geodynamical history of the different segments of the area since 6 Ma...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionThe {{evolution}} of Antarctica and the Antarctic Ocean {{is vital to}} understanding the growth and breakup of super continent Gondwana. The reconstruction models of Gondwana have been established by many authors using geophysical data set as well as geological data (e. g. Norton and Sclater, 1978). The area around Syowa Station, the Japanese Antarctic wintering Station in Lützow- Holm Bay, {{is considered to be}} a junction of Africa, India, Madagascar, and Antarctic continents from the reconstruction models of Gondwana. Therefore this area is a key to investigate the formation and fragmentation of Gondwana. However, the tectonic evolution is still speculative because geological evidence is limited to a few isolated outcrops and the coverage with geophysical surveys in this area is poor. Joint Japanese-German airborne geophysical surveys around Syowa Station had been conducted in January 2006 during the 47 th Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition to reveal tectonic {{evolution of}} the area around Syowa Station. The observation lines are shown in Figure 1. Data The airborne geophysical surveys had been made along almost N-S observation lines with spacing of about 20 km. Ice radar measurements had been carried out onshore area and ice thickness data are obtained. Bed rock topography are estimated using RAMP surface elevation data set. Magnetic and gravity measurements had been conducted both onshore and offshore areas. Magnetic anomalies are determined after correcting diurnal geomagnetic variations at Syowa Station. Precise positions of the aircraft are determined using DGPS techniques and free-air gravity anomalies are also obtained. Those data are girded and plotted using GMT software (Wessel and Smith, 1998). ResultsThe results of bed rock topography, gravity and magnetic anomalies are shown in Figures 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Characteristic features possibly related to the tectonic evolution from the results are summarized as followings [...] Large negative gravity anomalies are observed along the Shirase Glacier (A in Figure 3) and those almost correspond to deep bed rock topography. Two sets of positive and negative gravity anomalies are shown along ocean-continental transition (B in Figure 3). However, magnetic anomalies along ocean-continental transition indicate only one set. NW-SE trending positive magnetic anomalies are observed between 40 °E and 43 °E near Antarctic continental margin (A in Figure 4). Those almost correspond to the transitional zone from Amphibolite to Granulite faces in the Lützow-Holm Complex. NE-SW trending magnetic anomalies in offshore area possibly indicate magnetic anomaly lineations (B in Figure 4). Positive magnetic anomalies surrounded by negative ones are observed around Cape Hinode (C in Figure 4). DiscussionLarge negative gravity anomalies and deep bed topography along the Shirase Glacier (A in Figure 4) possibly indicate major geological boundaries. It has been inferred that the peak metamorphic grade of the Lützow-Holm Complex progressively increases in a southwestern direction from amphibolite-facies to granulite-facies conditions and higher metamorphic grade are observed near the Shirase Glacier (Hiroi et al., 1983). Therefore large negative gravity anomalies and deep bed topography along the Shirase Glacier most likely delineate southwestern boundary of the Lützow-Holm Complex. Characteristic magnetic anomaly features around Cape Hinode (C in Figure 5) may indicate an allochthonous unit in the Lützow-Holm Complex. The main orogenic activities of the Lützow-Holm Complex took place during the Latest Proterozoic ro Early Paleozoic times. However, older rocks around 1000 Ma were documented at Cape Hinode within the Lützow-Holm Complex (Shiraishi et al., 1994). Magnetic anomaly data will provide new constraints for constructing tectonic evolution model in this area. NE-SW trending magnetic anomalies (B in Figure 5) possibly represent M sequence magnetic anomaly lineations. ENE-WSW and E-W magnetic anomaly lineation trends, possibly belonging to the Mesozoic magnetic anomaly lineation sequence, accompanied by the NW-SE and NNW-SSE trending fracture zones are deduced from vector magnetic anomalies just seaward of the continental slope of Antarctica to the east of Gunnerus Ridge (Nogi et al. 1996). NE-SW trending magnetic anomalies show similar strikes of magnetic anomalies from vector magnetic anomalies. Two sets of positive and negative gravity along ocean-continental transition (B in Figure 4) possibly reflect initial breakup conditions of Gondwana. Magnetic anomalies along ocean-continental transition do not show two sets of positive and negative magnetic anomalies. However, possible magnetic anomaly lineation trends in this area are almost parallel to the trends of gravity anomalies along ocean-continental transition and those imply that the direction of initial extension are normal to present coast line of Antarctica in this area. Two sets of positive and negative gravity along ocean-continental transition may suggest initial extension of Gondwana breakup. ConclusionsThe <b>outline</b> of ice <b>thickness,</b> bed rock topography, gravity and magnetic anomaly results in the area around Syowa Station are shown. Characteristic features from the results are indicated and discussed. These results provide new constraints on the tectonic evolution in the area a junction of Africa, India, Madagascar, and Antarctic continents of Gondwana. Further data analysis are carrying out and detailed discussion will be made based on those results...|$|R
