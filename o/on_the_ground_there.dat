5|$|The aerial {{rules of}} {{engagement}} applied in Laos (which prescribed the offensive action of pilots and the locations and circumstances under which offensive actions could be taken) were created to protect the civilian population of the country. To the American pilots that conducted the missions, however, they became complex {{to the point of}} incomprehensibility. The rules were constantly altered and elaborated upon by the political decision makers in Washington and Vientiane and bore little relation to the reality <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>There</b> were different rules for every type of activity, for each different branch of service, and in each military region.|$|E

The day's operations were focused on Hong Kong, which was struck by 138 aircraft during the morning and a further 158 in the afternoon. The raiders sunk five large tankers and an IJN oiler, and damaged several other ships. In addition, Kai Tak Airport was badly damaged, and all the aircraft <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>there</b> at the time destroyed. Widespread damage was also inflicted on the Kowloon and Taikoo docks. However, the village of Hung Hom, which was located near the Kowloon docks, was heavily bombed and hundreds of civilians were killed or wounded. Stanley Internment Camp was also hit by a bomb which killed 14 of the Allied civilians imprisoned there. The Japanese garrison at Hong Kong strongly resisted the raid, using particularly effective anti-aircraft tactics which the Americans had not previously encountered; a US Navy report described the gunfire the aircraft faced as having been [...] "intense to unbelievable". The TBF Avenger torpedo bombers dispatched against Hong Kong suffered particularly heavy losses as their low-level attack runs were vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire. As the Avengers' torpedoes were set to run too deep these attacks achieved little.|$|E

2500|$|Senior Airbus executive, Fabrice Bregier, said on 30 May 2015 {{that there}} was [...] "either a {{weakness}} in the test procedure of planes before they fly, or a problem that results from the implementation of these procedures." [...] On 3 June 2015 Airbus announced that investigators had confirmed [...] "that engines one, two and three experienced power frozen after lift-off and {{did not respond to}} the crew's attempts to control the power setting in the normal way. Preliminary analyses have shown that all other aircraft systems performed normally and did not identify any other abnormalities throughout the flight." [...] The key scenario being examined by investigators is that the torque calibration parameter data was accidentally wiped on three engines as the engine software was being installed at Airbus facilities, which would prevent the FADECs from operating. Under the A400M's design, the first warning pilots would receive of the engine data problem would be when the plane was 120 meters (400 feet) in the air; <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>there</b> is no cockpit alert.|$|E

Algerian authorities reportedly kept the aircraft <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>there</b> {{at the request of}} Kuwaiti and Saudi Arabian authorities, but talks were stalled when both sides reached an impasse, something Algeria blamed on Kuwait's unwillingness to discuss the 17 prisoners, which it described as [...] "intransigent".

2500|$|The [...] "air drop" [...] {{sequence}} {{was conceived}} by stunt coordinator, Spiro Razatos, who also supervised on the franchise's two previous installments; Fast Five and Fast & Furious 6. Razatos told Business Insider {{that he wanted}} to rely more on real stunts rather than CGI because he wanted the whole sequence to [...] "feel real" [...] and fulfill audience's expectations. The stunt took months of prep-solving problems. Cameras needed to be mounted onto cars {{in a way that they}} would not be destroyed when the cars landed, and the crew had to figure out a safe way to get the cars out of the plane. They performed a dry run with a single car falling out of a plane and did this six times. Cars were dropped from a Lockheed C-130 Hercules high above the Arizona desert, but close up shots that show the cars landing on a mountain road were filmed in Colorado. There were two airplanes, flying at a height of 12,000 feet, each dropping two cars apiece. BRS parachutes enabled with GPS were secured to each of the cars before dropping off the C-130 plane. At about 5,000 feet, the parachutes deployed. Over 10 cameras were used for the sequence. In addition to cameras <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>there</b> were cameras remotely operated inside the plane and another three mounted outside each car. Additional cameras were on a helicopter, where Razatos was stationed watching monitors. Three skydivers used in the shoot wore helmet cameras to help shoot the sequence from multiple angles. Sky divers would either jump out before cars or after them. While all the cars landed on their drop zones, 70% landed perfectly and 30% didn't. For the close-up scenes which show the actors inside their cars, a giant gimbal with a 360-degree range of movement were attached to each of the cars and was filmed against a green screen to reproduce their tumble through the sky. The last part of the scene, which shows the cars hitting the road was shot separately. To get that right, the team set up a pulley system that had cars six to ten feet above the ground. When they were dropped from the cranes, the stuntmen who were sitting in the driver's seats raced their engines at about 35 to 40 miles per hour and slid to the ground at full speed. Those cranes were then later removed from the film with computers. Razatos admits that the air drop sequence was [...] "all real" [...] and that it would be [...] "hard to top".|$|E
