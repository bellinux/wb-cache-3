Despite his limited playing time, Del Piero still managed to score 14 goals as Juventus won their 28th league title, due to his overhead assist to teammate David Trezeguet, which proved decisive in a match against Milan at the San Siro. Del Piero also helped Juventus to reach the quarter finals of the UEFA Champions League that season, only losing out to eventual champions Liverpool.|$|E

5|$|After {{qualifying}} as a barrister, {{he moved}} to Birmingham in 1914, choosing the city because he had some connections there thanks to his association with Cadbury, and began work at the chambers of John Hurst. His career was aided by the outbreak of World War I; many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> and fitter barristers were called up for war service, whilst Birkett himself, who was thirty {{when he joined the}} bar, avoided conscription as he was declared medically unfit.

5|$|After {{these talks}} with Rudd, Lobengula called an indaba (conference) of over 100 izinDuna {{to present the}} {{proposed}} concession terms to them and gauge their sympathies.

The idea of a mining monopoly in the hands of Rudd's powerful backers was attractive to the Matabele in some ways, as it would end the incessant propositioning for concessions by small-time prospectors, {{but there was also a}} case for allowing competition to continue, so that the rival miners would have to compete for Lobengula's favour.|$|E
5|$|Charles, Prince Elector and Duke of Bavaria, {{claimed the}} German territories of the Habsburg dynasty as a {{son-in-law}} of Joseph I, and furthermore presented himself as Charles VI's legitimate imperial successor.

Both Charles VI and his predecessor Joseph I had died without sons. Charles of Bavaria suggested that the legitimate succession pass to Joseph's female children, rather than to the daughters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> brother, Charles VI. For different reasons, Prussia, France, Spain and the Polish-Saxon monarchy supported Charles of Bavaria's claim to the Habsburg territory and the Imperial title and reneged on the Pragmatic Sanction.|$|E

5|$|Clifford {{had already}} {{achieved}} {{prominence in the}} north where, as an ally of {{the son of the}} earl of Northumberland, he took part in a feud against the Neville family, the Percy's natural rivals in Yorkshire. This consisted of a series of armed raids, assaults and skirmishes, and included an ambush on one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> Nevilles' wedding party in 1453. Historians have seen a direct connection between his involvement in the local feud in the north with the Nevilles, and his involvement in the national struggle against the duke of York, whom the Nevilles were closely allied with in the late 1450s. Although this was supposedly a period of temporary peace between the factions, Clifford and his allies appear to have made numerous attempts to ambush the Neville and Yorkist lords.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{succession}} {{plans were}} thrown into chaos by {{the sinking of}} the White Ship on 25 November 1120. Henry had left the port of Barfleur for England in the early evening, leaving William Adelin and many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> members of the court to follow on that night in a separate vessel, the White Ship. Both the crew and passengers were drunk and, just outside the harbour, the ship hit a submerged rock. The ship sank, killing as many as 300 people, with only one survivor, a butcher from Rouen. Henry's court was initially too scared to report William's death to the King. When he was finally told, he collapsed with grief.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, {{frustrated}} with the perceived lack of success against RAF Fighter Command, Göring was keen on infusing the fighter force leadership with younger blood. He perceived a lack of aggressiveness in the Jagdgeschwader leadership. The likes of Theo Osterkamp were the first victim of this policy, handing over JG 51 to Werner Mölders. Oesau {{was considered to be}} one such rising star. However, being a star and staying in Göring's favor required keeping up the kill rate and promotions were invariably linked to scores. According to Dr. Kurt Tank, the Focke–Wulf designer, although many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> generation were good flyers, they were unable to cope with problems of overall planning and broader strategic aspects. However, Oesau was one of the outstanding leaders ever produced by Luftwaffe fighter wings with the likes of Werner Mölders and Adolf Galland.|$|E

5|$|Khánh and a {{group of}} younger {{officers}} called the Young Turks—led by chief of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, commander of I Corps General Nguyễn Chánh Thi and IV Corps commander Thiệu—wanted to forcibly retire officers with more than 25 years of service, as they thought them to be lethargic and ineffective, but most importantly, rivals for power. Most of the older officers had more experience under the Vietnamese National Army during the French colonial era, and some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> men saw them as too detached from the modern situation. The Young Turks had quite a lot of influence over Khánh, as Thi and Kỳ had intervened militarily to save him from a coup attempt in September by Generals Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức.|$|E
5|$|Males {{establish}} their dominance more forcefully than females. A male disperses, or leaves his natal group and joins another group, after reaching sexual maturity. Adult males are very competitive {{with each other}} and fight for access to females. Higher dominance means better access to mating and earlier access to food, so naturally a great deal of fighting over rank occurs, with younger males constantly trying to rise in position. Because females stay with their groups their entire lives, and males emigrate to others, often a new male challenges an older one for dominance. Frequently, when older baboons drop in the social hierarchy, they move to another tribe. The younger males who pushed them down often bullies and harasses them. Older males tend to have more supportive and equal relationships than those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> males. The former may form coalitions against the latter.|$|E

5|$|The royals {{were eager}} to settle scores after Montfort’s defeat. At the Parliament at Winchester in September the same year, all those who had taken part in the {{rebellion}} were disinherited. Yet even though the uprising <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> Simon Montfort in Lincolnshire was over by Christmas, scattered resistance remained. The main problem was the garrison encamped at the virtually impregnable Kenilworth Castle, and a siege started {{in the summer of}} 1266 seemed futile. By the end of October, the royals drew up the so-called Dictum of Kenilworth, whereby rebels were allowed to buy back their land at prices dependent on their level of involvement in the rebellion. The defenders of the castle turned down the offer at first, {{but by the end of}} the year conditions had become intolerable, and in 1267 the Dictum was agreed upon.|$|E

Ngengi was harsh and resentful toward these three boys, with Wambui deciding to take her youngest son with her {{to stay with her}} parental family further north. It was there that she died, and Kenyatta—who was very fond <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> Muigai—travelled through the forest to collect his infant half-brother.
