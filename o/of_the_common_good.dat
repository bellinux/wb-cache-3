He studied in Europe during the Atlantic Revolutions, {{and was a}} versatile polyglot, capable of understanding Spanish, English, French, Italian, and some indigenous languages. This allowed him to read many influential books of the Age of Enlightenment, and understand the social, economic, technical, educative, political, cultural, and religious changes that were being prompted by the new ideas. He helped to promote those ideas using the press and with {{his work in the}} Consulate. He rejected localist perspectives, favouring a Latin Americanist one. He was driven by the concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>good,</b> which he regarded as an ethical value. He considered public health, education, and work as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>good,</b> as well as religion. He did not share completely the ideas of the French Revolution, but instead the tempered ones of the Spanish Enlightenment: most notably, he remained a monarchist and held strong religious beliefs, being Roman Catholic and a devotee of Marian theology. His monarchism was not a conservative one, as he agreed that the existing state of things should be modified, but not towards a republic as in France or the United States, but towards a constitutional monarchy, like in Britain.|$|E

25|$|Toro {{was unable}} to secure a lasting popular support. A group of more radical {{officers}} resented his reluctance to challenge the rosca, and they supported a coup by Colonel Germán Busch Becerra (1937–39) in 1937. A new constitution was promulgated in 1938, stressing the primacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>good</b> over private property and favored government intervention in social and economic relations. It also legalized the Indian communities and included a labor code. In 1939 Busch challenged {{the interests of the}} mine owners for the first time by issuing a decree that would prevent the mining companies from removing capital from the country. None of his policies, however, resulted in significant popular and military support, and completely alienated the conservative forces. Frustrated by his inability to bring about change, Busch committed suicide in 1939.|$|E
25|$|Stanfield {{was born}} in Truro, Nova Scotia, the son of Sarah Emma (née Thomas) and {{entrepreneur}} Frank Stanfield. His family owned Stanfield's Limited, a large textile company. He studied economics and political science at Dalhousie University and was awarded the Governor General's Silver Medal for achieving the highest standing when he graduated in 1936 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He then studied law at Harvard Law School, where he was an honours student {{near the top of}} his class. He was the first Canadian to ever edit the Harvard Law Review. During his student days in the 1930s, he witnessed the poverty that the Great Depression produced, causing him to become interested in John Maynard Keynes' economic theories. Stanfield considered himself a socialist at this time. Over time, he was less attached to socialism, but its influence on him remained, as he was considered a Red Tory for his appreciation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>good.</b>|$|E
500|$|In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus {{recalls the}} commandment, [...] "You shall not kill" [...] and then adds to it the proscriptions against anger, hatred and vengeance. Going further, Christ asks his disciples to love their enemies. The Catechism asserts that [...] "it is {{legitimate}} {{to insist on}} respect for one's own right to life." [...] Kreeft says, [...] "self-defense is legitimate {{for the same reason}} suicide is not: because one's own life is a gift from God, a treasure we are responsible for preserving and defending." [...] The Catechism teaches that [...] "someone who defends his life is not guilty of murder even if he is forced to deal his aggressor a lethal blow." [...] Legitimate defense can be not only a right but a grave duty for one who is responsible for the lives of others.

500|$|According to {{historian}} Félix Luna's Breve {{historia de}} los Argentinos (...) , {{one of the}} most important societal consequences of the May Revolution was the shift in the way the people and its rulers related. Until then, the conception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>good</b> prevailed: while royal authority was fully respected, if an instruction from the crown of Spain was considered detrimental to the common good of the local population, it was half-met or simply ignored. With the revolution, the concept of common good gave way to that of popular sovereignty, as theorized by Moreno, Castelli and Monteagudo, among others. This idea held that, in the absence of a legitimate authority, the people had the right to appoint their own leaders. Over time, popular sovereignty would give way to the idea of majority rule. This maturation of ideas was gradual, taking many decades to crystallize into stable electoral and political systems, but it was what ultimately led to the adoption of the republican system as the form of government for Argentina. Domingo Faustino Sarmiento stated similar views in his Facundo, and noted that cities were more receptive to republican ideas, while rural areas were more resistant to them, which led to the surge of caudillos.|$|E

2500|$|Summary on {{justice and}} charity, and the Church's role. The Church cannot and must not take upon herself the {{political}} battle {{to bring about}} the most just society possible. She cannot and must not replace the State. Yet {{at the same time she}} cannot and must not remain on the sidelines in the fight for justice. She has to play her part through rational argument and she has to reawaken the spiritual energy without which justice, which always demands sacrifice, cannot prevail and prosper. [...] A just society must be the achievement of politics, not of the Church. Yet the promotion of justice through efforts to bring about openness of mind and will to the demands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>good</b> is something which concerns the Church deeply... The Church's charitable organizations, on the other hand, constitute an opus proprium, a task agreeable to her, in which she does not cooperate collaterally, but acts as a subject with direct responsibility, doing what corresponds to her nature.

2500|$|If the Dutch Republicans {{wanted an}} example of a Prince who fomented trouble by foreign {{military}} adventures to the detriment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>good,</b> they only had to point across the English Channel to the uncle of the Prince of Orange, Charles II of England. Charles had been restored to the throne of his father in 1660, after first apparently making his peace with the Dutch regents, who had treated him so scornfully after 1654. The end of the Protectorate in [...] England had given the Dutch regents hope that the new English regime might be less bellicose than the Commonwealth. To ensure the good graces of Charles he was extensively fêted during his stay in the Netherlands before his triumphant return to England. It was hoped that the Dutch Gift would further mellow his feelings toward the Dutch, maybe even persuade him to rescind the Navigation Acts. Charles took the opportunity to further the interests of his sister Mary and nephew William (now ten years old) by emphasizing his great affection for both. The Orangists, of course, needed little encouragement to add this to their quiver of arguments in favor of dynastic preferment. But also many opportunistic States-Party regents, discerning a change in the wind, started to make pro-Orange noises, especially in the Amsterdam vroedschap. This disturbed De Witt no end, as he feared that this would undermine the position of his party.|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith {{published}} a statement {{under the title}} [...] "Some Considerations Concerning the Catholic Response to Legislative Proposals on the Non-Discrimination of Homosexual Persons".

After recalling what it had already stated in its 1986 letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the pastoral care of homosexual persons, it declared that, because of the moral concern that sexual orientation raises, it is different from qualities such as race, ethnicity, sex or age, and therefore [...] "there are areas where it is not unjust discrimination to take sexual orientation into account, for example, in the placement of children for adoption or foster care, in employment of teachers or athletic coaches, and in military recruitment". Limitation of rights is permissible, and sometimes even obligatory, in cases of [...] "objectively disordered external conduct", even if the conduct is not culpable, as in the case of [...] "contagious or mentally ill persons", the exercise of whose rights can justly, for the sake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>good,</b> be restricted.|$|E
