2500|$|Allen's {{response}} was measured. He requested that any decision on his progress be deferred until a report {{could be made}} by a liaison officer or more senior officer. [...] MacArthur and Blamey continued to press Allen through the delays experienced at Templeton's Crossing and Eora Village. [...] To his credit, Allen stood by his subordinates. Just as the 16th Brigade was advancing on Eora Village, a signal from MacArthur through Blamey on 21 October further pressured Allen: [...] "Operations reports show that progress on the trail is NOT repeat NOT satisfactory. The tactical handling of <b>our</b> <b>troops</b> <b>in</b> my opinion is faulty." [...] Allen replied, in part: [...] "I have complete confidence in my brigade commanders and troops and feel {{that they could not}} have done better." [...] Allen's trust may have been misplaced though, as Anderson describes Lloyd as having [...] "botched" [...] the tactical handling of the first two days of the engagement at Eora Village that were just then unfolding. He also notes that the downward pressure being applied for haste likely weighed heavily in Lloyd's decision to proceed initially with a frontal attack. [...] The pressure for more haste thereby contributed to increasing the delays. On 28 October, Blamey ordered Allen's recall and replacement by Vasey. Allen had vouched for the judgement [...] and professionalism of his brigade commanders (in this case, specifically Lloyd) and in this, he was ultimately responsible; however, Anderson opines that Allen's replacement may have been inevitable, regardless of the justification.|$|E

60|$|Certain {{summers ago}} our cruisers, the St. Louis and the Harvard, arrived at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, with sixteen or {{seventeen}} hundred Spanish prisoners from Santiago de Cuba. They were partly {{soldiers of the}} land forces picked up by <b>our</b> <b>troops</b> <b>in</b> the fights before the city, but by far the greater part were sailors and marines from Cervera's ill-fated fleet. I have not much stomach for war, but the poetry of the fact I have stated made a very potent appeal to me on my literary side, and I did not hold out against it longer than to let the St. Louis get away with Cervera to Annapolis, when only her less dignified captives remained {{with those of the}} Harvard to feed either the vainglory or the pensive curiosity of the spectator. Then I went over from our summer colony to Kittery Point, and got a boat, and sailed out {{to have a look at}} these subordinate enemies in the first hours of their imprisonment.|$|E

"The tactics {{they are}} {{adopting}} certainly look like it, Pollio; {{and if they}} continue to fight as they have done so far, we are likely to have no better fortune than Suetonius had in his campaign against them. It is ten days since we left Cosenza, we have made but some ten miles advance among the hills, and we have lost already eight hundred hoplites, and I know not how many light armed troops. At this rate our force will melt away to nothing before we have half cleared this wilderness of rock and forest. Hitherto in their revolts the gladiators have met <b>our</b> <b>troops</b> <b>in</b> pitched battle, but their strength and skill have not availed against Roman discipline.

60|$|He {{was delighted}} with his master, whom {{he came to}} esteem highly, finding him a most {{intelligent}} companion {{as well as an}} unwearied teacher. Strelinski, indeed, would have been glad to have devoted twelve hours a day instead of five, could Frank have afforded the time. He was a very different man now to what he was when he had first called at Sir Robert Wilson's lodgings. He looked well and happy; his cheeks had filled out, and he carried himself well; he dressed with scrupulous care, and when Frank had no engagement with his comrades, the Pole accompanied him on long rides on his spare charger, he having been accustomed to riding from his childhood. From him Frank learned {{a great deal of the}} state of things in Poland and Russia, and gained a considerable insight into European politics, besides picking up a more intimate colloquial knowledge of Russian than he gained at his lessons. Of an evening Frank not unfrequently went to parties in the town. The gallant deeds of <b>our</b> <b>troops</b> <b>in</b> Spain had raised the military to great popularity throughout the country, and the houses of all the principal inhabitants of Canterbury were hospitably opened to officers of the garrison.|$|E
60|$|As all men {{thought there}} would be a battle between the French and the Spaniards, I could not prevail with myself to lose the opportunity, and {{therefore}} by the help of the passes above mentioned, I came to the French army under the Duke of Montmorency. We marched through the enemy's country with great boldness and no small hazard, for the Duke of Savoy appeared frequently with great bodies of horse on the rear of the army, and frequently skirmished with <b>our</b> <b>troops,</b> <b>in</b> one of which I had the folly--I can call it no better, for I had no business there--to go out and see the sport, as the French gentlemen called it. I was but a raw soldier, and did not like the sport at all, for this party was surrounded by the Duke of Savoy, and almost all killed, for as to quarter they neither asked nor gave. I ran away very fairly, one of the first, and my companion with me, and by the goodness of our horses got out of the fray, and being not much known in the army, we came into the camp an hour or two after, as if we had been only riding abroad for the air.|$|E
6000|$|... (*4) NOTE.--It {{had been}} a {{favorite}} idea with General Scott for a [...] great many years before the Mexican war to have established in [...] the United States a soldiers' home, patterned after something of [...] the kind abroad, particularly, I believe, in France. He [...] recommended this uniformly, or at least frequently, in his [...] annual reports to the Secretary of War, but never got any [...] hearing. Now, as he had conquered the state, he made [...] assessments upon the different large towns and cities occupied [...] by <b>our</b> <b>troops,</b> <b>in</b> proportion to their capacity to pay, and [...] appointed officers to receive the money. In addition to the sum [...] thus realized he had derived, through capture at Cerro Gordo, [...] sales of captured government tobacco, etc., sums which swelled [...] the fund {{to a total of}} about $220,000. Portions of this fund [...] were distributed among the rank and file, given to the wounded [...] in hospital, or applied in other ways, leaving a balance of some [...] $118,000 remaining unapplied {{at the close of the}} war. After the [...] war was over and the troops all home, General Scott applied to [...] have this money, which had never been turned into the Treasury [...] of the United States, expended in establishing such homes as he [...] had previously recommended. This fund was the foundation of the [...] Soldiers' Home at Washington City, and also one at Harrodsburgh, [...] Kentucky.|$|E

60|$|In one of {{the late}} {{movements}} of <b>our</b> <b>troops</b> <b>in</b> the valley, (near Upperville, I think,) a strong force of Moseby's mounted guerillas attack'd a train of wounded, and the guard of cavalry convoying them. The ambulances contain'd about 60 wounded, {{quite a number of}} them officers of rank. The rebels were in strength, and the capture of the train and its partial guard after a short snap was effectually accomplish'd. No sooner had our men surrender'd, the rebels instantly commenced robbing the train and murdering their prisoners, even the wounded. Here is the scene, or a sample of it, ten minutes after. Among the wounded officers in the ambulances were one, a lieutenant of regulars, and another of higher rank. These two were dragg'd out on the ground on their backs, and were now surrounded by the guerillas, a demoniac crowd, each member of which was stabbing them in different parts of their bodies. One of the officers had his feet pinn'd firmly to the ground by bayonets stuck through them and thrust into the ground. These two officers, as afterwards found on examination, had receiv'd about twenty such thrusts, some of them through the mouth, face, &c. The wounded had all been dragg'd (to give a better chance also for plunder,) out of their wagons; some had been effectually dispatch'd, and their bodies were lying there lifeless and bloody. Others, not yet dead, but horribly mutilated, were moaning or groaning. Of our men who surrender'd, most had been thus maim'd or slaughter'd.|$|E
60|$|During the 12th and 13th, {{and until}} the arrival of Wallace and Thayer on the 14th, the National forces, {{composed}} of but 15,000 men, without intrenchments, confronted an intrenched army of 21,000, without conflict further than what was brought on by ourselves. Only one gunboat had arrived. There was a little skirmishing each day, {{brought on by the}} movement of <b>our</b> <b>troops</b> <b>in</b> securing commanding positions; but there was no actual fighting during this time except once, on the 13th, in front of McClernand's command. That general had undertaken to capture a battery of the enemy which was annoying his men. Without orders or authority he sent three regiments to make the assault. The battery was in the main line of the enemy, which was defended by his whole army present. Of course the assault was a failure, and of course the loss on our side was great for the number of men engaged. In this assault Colonel William Morrison fell badly wounded. Up to this time the surgeons with the army had no difficulty in finding room in the houses near our line for all the sick and wounded; but now hospitals were overcrowded. Owing, however, to the energy and skill of the surgeons the suffering was not so great as it might have been. The hospital arrangements at Fort Donelson were as complete as it was possible to make them, considering the inclemency of the weather and the lack of tents, in a sparsely settled country where the houses were generally of but one or two rooms.|$|E
