40|$|The {{current study}} aims to {{investigate}} the association between <b>ownership</b> structure (type <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> and rank <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> concentration) and accounting conservatism based on operating and book approaches. Four hypotheses were assumed to achieve this aim. First and second hypotheses assess the relation between type <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> and rank <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> concentration and accounting conservatism {{on the basis of}} operating and book approaches. Third and fourth hypotheses appraise the relation between type <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> and rank <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> concentration and accounting conservatism based on book approach. According to review of literature and theoretical background, regression model and descriptive and inferential statistics were applied to analyze the obtained data. Applying systematic deletion, a target population of 100 listed companies on Tehran Stock Exchange was utilized in this study during a period of two years from 2008 to 2009. The achieved results of analyzing data confirm first hypothesis and reject second, third and fourth hypotheses. Findings of the study indicate that there is a significant linear relationship between types <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> and accounting conservatism based on operating approach; there is no significant relationship between type <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> and rank <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> concentration and accounting conservatism based on book approach...|$|R

30|$|The {{dissociation}} {{of sense}} of agency and sense <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> is for sure, but how these two senses {{interact with each other}} is not clear enough. Data from behavioral experiments support the additive model, which indicates that sense of agency seems to promote the integration of the sense <b>of</b> <b>ownership,</b> pure sense <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> is fragmentary, and sense of agency can integrate different body parts into a continuum and form a unified body awareness (Tsakiris, Prabhu, & Haggard, 2006; Synofzik et al, 2008; Stein, 1964). However, brain imaging experiments are more supportive of the independent model, according to which sense of agency and sense <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> are essentially different experiences, triggered by different inputs, and using different brain networks, there is no direct overlap (Tsakiris, Longo, & Haggard, 2010). From our point of view, such inconsistency may lie in the experimental design. Since we usually experience sense of agency with sense <b>of</b> <b>ownership,</b> the role <b>of</b> these two types of experiences may not be separated in normal behavioral experiments. Through our research, we can find that when sense of agency and sense <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> were properly separated, the results obtained are consistent with the hypothesis proposed by the independent model. However, our findings do not support claims that sense of agency and sense <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> have no interactions. The interaction of modality and synchronicity {{had a significant impact on}} sense <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> rather than sense of agency, indicating sense of agency seems to increase sense <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> but not vice versa.|$|R
