5|$|Word was {{spreading}} about the band's bizarre stage show {{by the time}} they hit the road again, resulting in ever-larger audiences at their concerts. Not long after Malcolm's arrival, the band recorded their act for posterity by filming two concerts at Detroit's Traxx club. Some of this footage was eventually packaged as Blind Eye Sees All, their only official video release to date. They purchased their first 8-track recorder at this time, and used it to record two songs later used on the A-side <b>of</b> <b>Cream</b> Corn from the Socket of Davis.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} transit room {{conversion}} to office space {{the building has}} seen other major work in the past. The southwest {{corner of the building}} was built in 1956, <b>of</b> <b>cream</b> colored brick, to house additional classrooms and office space. The addition of 1956 took special care to replicate nearly every aspect of the original building except for color. Another major addition occurred in 1966 with the construction of the large east wing. Of the same cream colored brick as the 1956 addition, it also tried to mimic the building's finer details. The 1966 east wing addition provided for, again, more office space, but this project also included space for a new darkroom and a radio telescope laboratory. The observatory basement and the dome housing the refractor are still in use by the astronomy department at U of I and the University of Illinois Astronomical Society, a student organization on campus.|$|E

5|$|In some instances, the {{production}} of analogue pizza cheese can be similar to {{the production}} <b>of</b> <b>cream</b> cheese, although production may be different and homogenization may be avoided. In some varieties, the product is heated to remain at a specific temperature and for a specific amount of time, which causes the proteins in the mix to gelatinize. During this process, salts in the mix serve to emulsify it and thus improve the meltability of the final product. The heated product is then placed in packaging such as bags-in-boxes while still hot, as it is more easily handled in this state compared to when in a solid state. During packaging, these types of pizza cheeses are then quick-cooled to avoid browning of the product, which can occur vis-a-vis the Maillard reaction.|$|E
5|$|Some {{versions}} may use mayonnaise, {{other types}} of cheese, such as pepper jack cheese, brie cheese or Cheddar cheese instead <b>of</b> <b>cream</b> cheese as primary ingredients. Some may incorporate other seafoods in addition to crab, such as imitation crab, lobster, shrimp and surimi. Additional ingredients may include mushrooms, artichoke, onion, green onion, shallot, green pepper, bread crumbs (such as panko), heavy cream and others. Bread crumbs {{may be used to}} top the dish, which may be browned during the cooking process creating a crust. Sometimes Parmesan cheese is combined with the bread crumbs. Some versions use Old Bay Seasoning as an ingredient to add flavor, and some are prepared spicy with the addition of ingredients such as hot sauce and red pepper.|$|E
5|$|Deep Purple {{arrived in}} California on 15 October 1968 and their first public {{appearance}} on American soil was at The Dating Game TV show on ABC on 17 October. They {{were the first}} rock band to perform on the show, where Jon Lord {{was one of the}} contestants. The next two days the band played live in the US {{for the first time as}} supporting act <b>of</b> <b>Cream</b> in their Goodbye tour. The concerts were held at the Inglewood Forum near Los Angeles, California, in front of more than 16,000 people every night. Recordings of those live shows were issued in 2002 as Inglewood – Live in California. The next gig at San Diego was the last one supporting Cream, whose management apparently did not appreciate the cheerful reaction of the audience to Deep Purple and dropped them. After a week of forced stop, their American manager succeeded in setting up a tour which included the San Francisco International Pop Festival and venues on the West Coast. This opportunity was very useful for the young musicians, who as headliners could lengthen their live shows up to 90 minutes and gained much needed experience on the road. This was particularly true for Blackmore, who developed and extended his guitar solos, incorporating more improvisations.|$|E

40|$|The {{theme of}} this diploma is sensory {{analysis}} <b>of</b> ice <b>creams.</b> This work is divided into theoretical and practical part. In theoretical part, there is described the history of knowledge <b>of</b> ice <b>cream,</b> ingredients, which are needed for the production and requests for quality of this ingrediens. Production, packing, right storing and transportation <b>of</b> ice <b>cream</b> are described in details. In this work, there are also described requests for quality <b>of</b> ice <b>cream,</b> defects, dividing, health aspects connected with consumption <b>of</b> frozen <b>creams,</b> right marking <b>of</b> wraps, microbiology <b>of</b> frozen <b>creams</b> and sweetener Stévie, which is used in practical part. There is also described sensory analysis, it's open-minded and subjective factors, it's own sensory rating, kinds of examinations during sensory rating and DLG rating. The aim of practical work is preparation <b>of</b> frozen <b>creams</b> with two flavours [...] vanilla and chocolate with sweetener Stévie and with sugar. By using sensory analysis it was analysed frozen creams produced by standard technology with sweetener Stévie and with sugar, with sample <b>of</b> frozen <b>creams</b> bought in common shops. The aim was to specify, how people sense the taste <b>of</b> ice <b>cream</b> with sweetener Stévie. The samples <b>of</b> frozen <b>creams</b> were rated immediately after the production and after six months storage.

40|$|AbstractThe slurry of mPCM {{has been}} widely used for {{enhancing}} heat transfer and reducing building energy consumption. Because of intrinsic density differences between mPCM and water, the slurry is subject to creaming phenomena. As a consequence the viscosity of slurry increases and the thermal properties decrease. Up to now no quantitative analysis about the <b>creaming</b> <b>of</b> mPCM has been done. In the paper experimental measurement and numerical modeling <b>of</b> the <b>creaming</b> <b>of</b> mPCM slurry is presented. Using the optical method, the temporal-spatial distribution of volume concentration is recorded. Based on the conservation model, the process <b>of</b> <b>creaming</b> has been simulated...|$|R
25|$|The tree {{maintained}} its {{connection with the}} dairy industry through the mid-20th century, serving as a collection point for dairy farmers bringing cans <b>of</b> <b>cream</b> to be loaded and transported by road to Gladstone when the first motorised truck began carting cream from Miriam Vale to the Port Curtis Dairy Factory in 1952. By this year a ramp, facing Blomfield Street, had been built alongside {{the trunk of the}} Big Fig for the loading <b>of</b> <b>cream</b> and later milk cans onto the back of delivery vehicles. The place served as an easily accessible and shady location for farmers to assemble and wait for their produce to be loaded. During the 1960s, the original loading ramp was replaced with a new ramp, and an early fence and gates, reputedly constructed around the tree and cream/milk collection area by Queensland Railways, was demolished. The new ramp was built facing Station Street, and remained until at least 1977 when the last contract for the milk run to Gladstone was cancelled. Several small earth mounds {{to the north of the}} trunk of the Fig Tree are all that remain of the second ramp.|$|E
