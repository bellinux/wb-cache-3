5|$|All major {{characters}} in the miniseries were played by the five members <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Kids</b> <b>in</b> the Hall, except for the mayor's son, who was played by young actor Landon Reynolds-Trudel. Several of the original The Kids in the Hall characters appear in cameo roles, including Mark McKinney's Chicken Lady as a candidate juror and Paul Bellini clad only in his towel at an ATM; in addition, McCulloch and McKinney's police officers are tweaked variations of their OPP officer characters of the original series.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{proposed}} by Bruce McCulloch during a 2008 The Kids in the Hall comedy tour and {{developed by the}} ensemble into a dark-comedy murder mystery, a departure from their typical sketch comedy format. Inspiration for the series came {{in part from the}} British comedy series The League of Gentlemen. While the members <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Kids</b> <b>in</b> the Hall play all of the major adult characters, a number of other comedic actors appear in supporting roles, including Dan Redican, Colin Mochrie, Wayne Robson, Susan Kent and Mike Beaver. The series was filmed in North Bay, Mattawa and Sturgeon Falls, Ontario in the summer of 2009.|$|E
25|$|A man (McKinney) named Darill (pronounced da-RILL), {{who never}} quite understands {{what is going}} on, but always tries to affect an air of sophistication. Darill's strange mix of sunny good will, idiocy and pretense annoys {{everyone}} he meets, although he is rarely aware of it. Famous Darill sketches involve him hosting a painting show on television, and joining the Big Brother program and mentoring an unreceptive boy. The background for Darill's strange behavior is explained somewhat in one sketch, in which we see a flashback of Darill {{as a child in}} Belgium, and the strange rapport he enjoys with his mother (whom he still lives with, much to the confusion of the date he has brought back to his apartment). One sketch also reveals that the only thing he ever daydreams about is a tiny oom-pah band playing on a windowsill, and is astonished when he discovers others don't have that limitation. After the end <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Kids</b> <b>in</b> the Hall television show, Mark McKinney became a Saturday Night Live cast member, and brought Darill onto that show.|$|E

Between 1897 and 1909, during the Progressive era [...] of political activism and reform, the popular American novelist Emerson Hough wrote magazine articles, novels and informal histories that reintroduced Billy <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> to a national audience, albeit in works that often relied more on fantasy than on actual events. Hough embellished <b>the</b> <b>Kid's</b> reputation with lurid descriptions of his exceptional villainy in an article called [...] "Billy the Kid: <b>The</b> True Story <b>of</b> a Western 'Bad Man' [...] ", written in 1901 for the literary publication, Everybody's Magazine, using language like [...] "the soul of some fierce and far-off carnivor got into <b>the</b> body <b>of</b> this little man, this boy, this fiend in tight boots and a broad hat." [...] Hough further developed this image <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>in</b> his book about western desperados, <b>The</b> Story <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Outlaw (1907), though not in such excessive language.|$|R

The second is a romantic and sentimental hero, the brave and likeable leader of an outnumbered band fighting for justice.” Both facets of his legend were perpetuated in often poorly researched biographies, {{as well as in}} fictionalized B movies, many of which were nonetheless commercially successful.|$|R
