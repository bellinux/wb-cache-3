Smathers' tactics included dubbing his opponent [...] "Red Pepper" [...] and distributing red-covered brochures, The Red Record of Senator Claude Pepper, {{that included a}} photograph of Pepper with Marcantonio. Soon after Smathers' triumph in the primary, which {{in the days of}} the yellow dog South was tantamount to election, South Dakota Republican Senator Karl Mundt, who when in the House had served with Nixon on HUAC, sent him a letter telling him about Smathers' brochure. Senator Mundt wrote to Nixon, [...] "It <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that if Helen is your opponent in the fall, something of a similar nature might well be produced..." [...] Douglas wrote of Senator Pepper's defeat, [...] "The loss of Pepper is a great tragedy, and we are sick about it." [...] She also noted, [...] "What a vicious campaign was carried on against him. No doubt the fur will begin to fly out here too", and [...] "It is revolting to think of the depths to which people will go." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} surviving written use of {{the term}} {{can be found in the}} diary of 2nd Lieutenant Jackson B. A. Lowrance, who wrote the following on February 6, 1863 while in Pender County, southeastern North Carolina: [...] "I know now what is meant by the Piney Woods of North Carolina and the idea <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that it is no wonder we are called 'Tar Heels'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sister Pascalina later {{recalled}} that the Nuncio was heartbroken that the Kaiser turned [...] "deaf ear {{to all his}} proposals". She later wrote, [...] "Thinking back today on that time, when we Germans still all believed that our weapons would be victorious and the Nuncio was deeply sorry that the chance had been missed to save what there was to save, it <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{over and over again}} how clearly he foresaw what was to come. Once as he traced the course of the Rhine with his finger on a map, he said sadly, 'No doubt this will be lost as well.' I did not want to believe it, but here, too, he was to be proved right." ...|$|E

2500|$|Throughout June the Portland Whigs {{were very}} close to forming a {{coalition}} government {{and it was the}} Duke of Portland's need to win Fitzwilliam's support for such a policy that alone stopped him taking the decision. Fitzwilliam met him at Burlington House on 25 May in which he told Fitzwilliam he had met Pitt the previous day, with the Prime Minister telling him for his wish for a coalition as [...] "the expulsion of that evil spirit ...and [...] that his wish and object was that it might make us act together as one great Family... lamented the scantiness of Cabinet employments he had it in his power at this moment to offer us" [...] but assured him that they would be offered when they became available. Fitzwilliam declined to meet Pitt with the Duke of Portland on 13 June as he was organising the Volunteers in the West Riding but his objection went deeper: [...] "However frequently I have thought on the subject...it never <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> without presenting itself in some new point of view, which generally tends to render decision more difficult". He would not take that decision until Pitt clarified his offer of positions for Whigs in any prospective government. The Duke of Portland claimed he could not further negotiate with Pitt without Fitzwilliam's support, with Fitzwilliam replying that without a declaration from Pitt that the main war aim was the restoration of the House of Bourbon he could not take office but he reassured him that if he joined the government he would have his support. Fitzwilliam also still thought the way Pitt had come to power in 1783 was [...] "a severe blow to the spirit of the constitution and to Whiggism, which is the essence of it".|$|E
