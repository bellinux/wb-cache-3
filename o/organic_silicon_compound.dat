Researcher Erwin Emmerling of Technical University Munich announced he believed it would be possible to restore the smaller statue using an <b>organic</b> <b>silicon</b> <b>compound.</b> The Paris conference issued a list of 39 recommendations for the safeguarding of the Bamiyan site. These included leaving the larger Western niche empty as a monument to the destruction of the Buddhas, a feasibility study into the rebuilding of the Eastern Buddha, and the construction of a central museum and several smaller site museums. Work has since begun on restoring the Buddhas using the process of anastylosis, where original elements are combined with modern material. It is estimated that roughly half the pieces of the Buddhas can be put back together according to Bert Praxenthaler, a German art historian and sculptor involved in the restoration. The restoration of the caves and Buddhas has also involved training and employing local people as stone carvers. The project, which also aims to encourage tourism to the area, is being organised by UNESCO and the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS).|$|E

ABSTRACT Study of the {{interaction}} of moisturizers with a Crotalus durissus biomembrane by differential scanning calorimetry and RAMAN spectroscopy The objective {{of this research was}} to use biophysical techniques to investigate the alterations induced in a biomembrane model of the stratum corneum by the application of moisturizers. The biomembrane was obtained from the skin shed by the rattlesnake Crotalus durissus and the active moisturizing compounds were: urea, dimethylsilanol hyaluronate, Imperata cylindrical plant extract, carbohydrates and natural moisturizing factors (NMF components). Results from FT-Raman spectroscopy suggested that the moisturizers were safe, since they did not promote modifications {{in the structure of the}} stratum corneum.

Almost 25 years after identifying silicon dioxide in the exhaust gases from engines powered using sewage and landfill gas, a wide range of studies have been conducted addressing the different stages of the siloxane life cycle. The cycle starts with the production and use of polydimethylsiloxane polymers {{in a wide range of}} industrial and domestic applications and its further dispersal into environmental compartments. Siloxanes are subsequently introduced into wastewater treatment plants, where as a result of their low biodegradability and high affinity to dissolved and particulate matter, they are first transferred from wastewater into sludge and later volatilized in biogas in anaerobic digesters. Biogas treatment technologies can reduce siloxane concentrations to less than 0. 1 mg/m 3; adsorbent materials with micro- and mesoporous structures appear to be the most relevant technology in technical and economic terms. The state-of-the-art on siloxanes is vast and extensive, but there are still some knowledge gaps to be addressed in the future, such as the standardization of the methodology for off-line analysis, the development of on-line monitoring equipment, better understanding the fates of siloxanes in wastewater treatment processes to operate at specific conditions to avoid siloxanes-related problems, the development of more selective and regenerative removal technologies from biogas to reduce operating costs and even to recover silicon, and better understand the detrimental effects on energy recovery technologies to determine the inlet concentration limits.

40|$|The {{treatment}} of dielectric materials with corona discharge causes that these materials are {{transferred to the}} electret state and, consequently, a quasi-constant electric field forms in the space surrounding the dielectric material. The charges, captured {{on the surface and}} in the volume of the material and injected {{as a result of this}} treatment form an efficient surface homocharge which exists for a long period of time. Consequently, this phenomenon can be utilised in practice. The electret effect is the basis of operation of electret microphones and sensors, jets and filters for efficient cleaning, is utilised in the development of programmable memory devices, and also for increasing the adhesion capacity of films and layers deposited on the dielectric substrate. The main relationships and the nature of the electret state are usually evident in the examination of modelling dielectric materials by measurements of the dependences of the effective surface charge density (ESCD) in relation to the storage time and the spectra of the current of thermally stimulated depolarization (TSD). On the basis of these measurements it is possible to calculate the parameters of the relaxation processes and relaxation devices, and also determine the physical models which can be used to described the electret state. The results of examination of the modelling dielectrics greatly facilitate the analysis and interpretation of the electro-physical properties of other dielectric materials with more complicated structure. In this work the experimental objects were represented by single crystals of lithium fluoride (modelling inorganic dielectric), <b>organic</b> <b>silicon</b> <b>compound</b> (modelling organic dielectric, used for the protection and the sealing of semiconductor crystals in the components in electronic industry), and polyethyleneterepthtalate film. The specimens of lithium fluoride and the compound were in the form of discs with a diameter of 20 mm, thickness 1 mm, and the specimens of Lavsan were in the form of squares, 20 x 20 mm, thickness 65 #mu#m. The specimens were treated with corona discharge from a sharp tip and temperatures of 22 and 170 deg. C. The measurements of ESCD were taken by the compensation method. The results of measurements of the time dependences of the ESCD of the corona electrets shows that there are relationships governing the relaxation of the electret state in dielectrics with different structure: if the {{treatment of}} the specimens was carried out at room temperature (22 deg.

Nevertheless, MCFC has slightly lower purity demands than low temperature fuel cells. This paper outlines the idea of a new catalytic purification process for landfill gas conditioning, which may be supposed to be more competitive than state-of-the-art technologies and summarises some lab-scale results. This catalytic process transforms harmful landfill gas minor compounds into products that can be easily removed from the gas stream by a subsequent adsorption step. The optimal process temperature was found to be in the range 250 - 400 °C. After a catalyst screening, two materials were identified, which have the ability to remove all harmful minor compounds from landfill gas. The first material was a commercial alumina that showed a high activity towards the removal of <b>organic</b> <b>silicon</b> <b>compounds.</b> The alumina protects both a subsequent catalyst for the removal of other organic minor compounds and the fuel cell. Due to gradual deactivation caused by silica deposition, the activated alumina needs to be periodically replaced. The second material was a commercial V 2 O 5 /TiO 2 -based catalyst that exhibited a high activity for the total oxidation of a broad spectrum of other harmful organic minor compounds into a simpler compound class "acid gases (HCl, HF and SO 2) ", which can be easily removed by absorption with e. g. alkalised alumina.

Resist materials, partially doped with photoactive compounds have been developed. The application of those materials in lithographic processes allows for the fabrication of microstructures with aspect ratio > 20 and structural details < 10 #mu#m. The pyrolysis behavior of the crosslinked resist materials has been researched. By inserting ceramic fillers a reduction of the sintering shrinkage was possible. (orig.)

40|$|The {{formation}} of colored <b>silicon</b> <b>compounds</b> under nonequilibrium conditions is discussed {{with reference to}} the composition of the Jupiter atmosphere. It is shown that many of these reactions produce strongly colored intermediates that are relatively stable and similar in appearance to those observed on Jupiter. It is suggested that the <b>silicon</b> <b>compounds</b> could substantially contribute to the colors observed on Jupiter. The colored intermediates {{may be the result of}} relatively rapid amorphous silicon monoxide formation in vertical atmospheric currents in the region near the red spot and in the red spot itself...|$|R
