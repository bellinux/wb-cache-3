40|$|Quantitative {{studies have}} been made by {{previous}} workers on the reactions to humidity of three classes of terrestrial arthropod. The isopods have been studied by Gunn (1937) and WalofT (1941), the sheep tick by Lees (1948), while a number of insects have been examined in this connexion. The <b>Onycophora</b> have so far escaped attention. From a consideration of the usual habitat of these creatures it appeared likely that a marked humidity reaction might exist. The experiments described below give an account of this reaction, its character and mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS The species chosen for study was Peripatopsis moseleyi (Wood-Mason). This species occurs in moderate numbers in many Natal forests and is invariably found in damp places, usually underneath old decayed logs of wood or burrowing in their substance. In the laboratory the animals were kept in shallow photographic dishes filled with pieces of decayed wood. These were sprayed with water once a week. The dishes were covered at one end with a glass plate and at the other with perforated zinc sheeting. The gradient of moisture thus produced lessened the danger of funga...|$|E
