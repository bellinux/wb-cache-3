5|$|On 24 January 2000, {{the part}} of the {{radiation}} therapy unit containing the radiation source was acquired by two scrap collectors, who claimed to have bought it from some strangers as scrap metal for resale. They took it home, planning to dismantle it later. On 1 February, the two, together with another two associates, attempted to dismantle the metal part (a 97-kilogram, 42-by-20-centimetre lead cylinder held in a stainless steel casing), which was the unit's source drawer. Using a hammer and chisel, they only managed to crack the welded seam. Two of the men then took the metal piece, along with other scrap metal, to a scrapyard on Soi Wat Mahawong in Phra Pradaeng District, Samut Prakan Province. There they asked a worker at the scrapyard to cut open the cylinder using an <b>oxyacetylene</b> <b>torch.</b> As the cylinder was cut open, two smaller cylindrical metal pieces, which had held the source capsule, fell out. The worker retrieved the two pieces and kept them in the scrapyard, but was unaware of the source capsule itself. The lead cylinder was returned to the scrap collectors for them to complete the disassembly.|$|E

25|$|Welding lead or 'lead burning' {{was much}} {{more common in the}} 19th century to make some pipe {{connections}} and tanks. Great skill is required but can be quickly learned. In building construction today some lead flashing is welded but soldered copper flashing is much more common in America. In the automotive body collision industry before the 1980s, oxyacetylene gas torch welding was seldom used to weld sheetmetal, since warpage was a byproduct besides the excess heat. Automotive body repair methods at the time were crude and yielded improprieties until MIG welding became the industry standard. Since the 1970s, when high strength steel became the standard for automotive manufacturing, electric welding became the preferred method. After the 1980s, the <b>oxyacetylene</b> <b>torch</b> fell out of use for sheetmetal welding in the industrialized world.|$|E

Finally, the strand is cut into predetermined lengths by mechanical shears or by travelling <b>oxyacetylene</b> <b>torches,</b> is marked for identification, and is taken either to a stockpile or to the next forming process.|$|R
25|$|Overnight on 23 January, gunmen set off {{a number}} of explosions along the wall near the crossing. Palestinians packed into cars and donkey carts, crossed the border into Egypt from Gaza on foot, to buy {{essential}} goods. Between 200,000 and 700,000 Palestinians crossed over to Egypt and bought items at shops at the Egyptian half of Rafah and the North Sinai Governorate's capital, Arish. A Palestinian security guard later told The Times of London that militants had been steadily cutting through {{the base of the}} Israeli Gaza Strip barrier with <b>oxyacetylene</b> <b>torches</b> for months.|$|R
2500|$|On an <b>oxyacetylene</b> <b>torch</b> system {{there will}} be three types of valves, the tank valve, the {{regulator}} valve, and the torch valve. There will be a set of these three valves for each gas. The gas in the tanks or cylinders is at high pressure. Oxygen cylinders are generally filled to approximately 2200 psi. The regulator converts the high pressure gas to a low pressure stream suitable for welding. [...] Acetylene cylinders must be maintained in an upright position to prevent the internal acetone and acetylene from separating in the filler material.|$|E
2500|$|On December 3, 1956, Bush Terminal was {{the site}} {{of what might have been}} the largest {{explosion}} in New York City history. Dockworkers were using an <b>oxyacetylene</b> <b>torch</b> to perform routine maintenance work when sparks ignited 26,365 pounds of ground foam rubber scrap. Employees abandoned initial efforts to control the blaze; 26 minutes later, the fire reached 37,000 pounds of Cordeau Detonant Fuse, setting off an explosion. The blast resulted in 10 deaths, 270 injuries, [...] "major destruction" [...] in a 1,000-foot radius, and broken windows a mile around. People 35 miles away reported hearing it.

50|$|Police {{first used}} {{explosives}} {{in an attempt}} to remove the steel plates but after the third explosion failed, they cut through them with an <b>oxyacetylene</b> cutting <b>torch.</b> Grand County Emergency Management Director Jim Holahan stated that authorities were able to access and remove Heemeyer's body at 2:00a.m. on June 5.|$|R
50|$|Continuous casting is a {{refinement}} of the casting {{process for the}} continuous, high-volume production of metal sections with a constant cross-section. Molten metal is poured into an open-ended, water-cooled mold, which allows a 'skin' of solid metal to form over the still-liquid centre, gradually solidifying the metal from the outside in. After solidification, the strand, as it is sometimes called, is continuously withdrawn from the mold. Predetermined lengths of the strand can be cut off by either mechanical shears or traveling <b>oxyacetylene</b> <b>torches</b> and transferred to further forming processes, or to a stockpile. Cast sizes can range from strip (a few millimeters thick by about five meters wide) to billets (90 to 160 mm square) to slabs (1.25 m wide by 230 mm thick). Sometimes, the strand may undergo an initial hot rolling process before being cut.|$|R
50|$|At 3:15 p.m., dockworkers {{were using}} an <b>oxyacetylene</b> <b>torch</b> {{to cut a}} column of the {{structure}} atop the pier.

50|$|Overseas Tankship had a ship, the Wagon Mound, docked in Sydney Harbour in October 1951. The {{crew had}} {{carelessly}} allowed furnace oil (also {{referred to as}} Bunker oil) to leak from their ship. The oil drifted under a wharf thickly coating {{the water and the}} shore where other ships were being repaired. Hot metal produced by welders using <b>oxyacetylene</b> <b>torches</b> on the respondent's timber wharf (Mort's Dock) at Sheerlegs Wharf fell on floating cotton waste which ignited the oil on the water. The wharf and ships moored there sustained substantial fire damage. In an action by Mort's Dock for damages for negligence it was found as a fact that the defendants did not know and could not reasonably have been expected to know that the oil was capable of being set alight when spread on water. The dock owners knew the oil was there, and continued to use welders.|$|R
5|$|Though the Admiralty {{arranged}} {{for some of}} the ships to be salvaged, most were left {{at the bottom of the}} sound until entrepreneur Ernest Cox bought the salvage rights and began to raise the remaining ships in the early 1920s. Bremse presented particular challenges. She had come to rest perched precariously on a rock, which sloped away dramatically, causing fears that she might slip off and sink in deeper water. Cox's salvage team sealed her bulkheads and divided the hull into watertight compartments. The hull was patched up and an airlock fitted, but the team ran into difficulties with the large amount of oil which covered the wreck, more than had been found in any other of the ships salvaged previously. A three-man team using <b>oxyacetylene</b> <b>torches</b> ignited some oil, causing an explosion. The men escaped without serious injuries, and thereafter small explosions and fires were common over the two months it took to prepare the ship, though no one was injured.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} {{carbon matrix}} composites (C/C) have received much attention {{due to their}} excellent high-temperature strength, high thermal conductivity, low {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE), good thermal shock resistance. However, the poor ablation resistance of the C/C restricts its high temperature ablating applications. Making a thin anti-ablation coating on the C/C has been proved to improve the performance effectively. In order to improve the anti-ablation property of the composite, MoSi 2 coatings were deposited by Atmosphere Plasma Spraying(APS) on the SiC covered C/C matrix. The SiC coatings were prepared by pack cementation. <b>Oxyacetylene</b> flame <b>torch</b> was selected to simulate the ablation situation. The ablation temperature was 1800 ℃. XRD and SEM were employed to discover the diversification of the coatings structure and composition. And the mechanism of anti-ablation of the MoSi 2 coatings system was investigated in this paper...|$|R
50|$|The {{far end of}} {{the tube}} is {{pre-heated}} and lit by an <b>oxyacetylene</b> <b>torch.</b> An intense stream of burning steel is produced at the workpiece end and can be used to cut rapidly through thick materials including steel and concrete.

50|$|Although Child {{was not a}} classically trained artist, he went {{to great}} lengths to obtain and shape the perfect stones for his beloved garden. He created a {{complete}} workshop in his yard for handling and cutting the stones, proudly stating that all the finish work for his statues was completed on the site. He also used some unconventional tools to cut the stones, including an <b>oxyacetylene</b> <b>torch</b> (usually used for welding). Besides help from his son-in-law Bryant Higgs, Child hired Maurice Edmunds Brooks to help with the Gilgal project.|$|E
50|$|In 9 August 1965, a {{fire and}} {{resultant}} loss of oxygen when a high-pressure hydraulic line was cut with an <b>oxyacetylene</b> <b>torch</b> in a missile silo (373-4) near Searcy, Arkansas, killed 53 people, mostly civilian repairmen doing maintenance. The fire occurred while the 750-ton silo lid was closed, which contributed to a reduced oxygen level for the men who survived the initial fire. Two men escaped alive, both with injuries due to the fire and smoke, one by groping in complete darkness for the exit. The missile survived and was undamaged.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The {{deposition}} of diamond films by low pressure CVD methods {{has been demonstrated}} using a number of thermal and plasma assisted CVD techniques. Addition of oxygen to the methane-hydrogen feedstock {{has been reported to}} improve the quality of diamond deposited and decrease the temperature at which diamond deposition is feasible. Oxygen also effects the growth rate and possibly the uniformity of the film. In this paper an experimental design methodology, factorial analysis, is presented which is, in principle, applicable to any CVD process. The factorial analysis identifies the most influential growth parameters and any interactions between independently variable parameters. f i e analysis has been applied to diamond growth using CH 4 - 0 2 -Hz mixtures in a microwave assisted CVD process.

5000|$|Transferred arc process: The arc {{is formed}} between the electrode(-) {{and the work}} piece(+). In other words, arc is {{transferred}} from the electrode to the work piece. A transferred arc possesses high energy density and plasma jet velocity. For this reason it is employed to cut and melt metals. Besides carbon steels this process can cut stainless steel and nonferrous metals where an <b>oxyacetylene</b> <b>torch</b> does not succeed. Transferred arc {{can also be used}} for welding at high arc travel speeds. For initiating a transferred arc, a current limiting resistor is put in the circuit, which permits a flow of about 50 amps, between the nozzle and electrode and a pilot arc is established between the electrode and the nozzle. As the pilot arc touches the job main current starts flowing between electrode and job, thus igniting the transferred arc. The pilot arc initiating unit gets disconnected and pilot arc extinguishes as soon as the arc between the electrode and the job is started. The temperature of a constricted plasma arc may be of the order of 8000 - 25000°C.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{hundreds}} of tools which can be used. They are generally made by the jeweller/crafts person. They are typically made from bars of tool steel, which is forged and tempered at the tip. These hardened steel punches may be purchased by a supplier, but the specialized punches are made by the jeweler or special ordered to suit a particular design. [...] A saw {{can be used to}} cut designs into the tip for making patterns, or the tool can be hammered onto a patterned surface, which will indent the tip. The end of the tool which is to be hammered should be bevelled to allow for expansion of the metal from repeated hammering. Some of the main styles of tool include: Liners, planishers, matting, and doming. Liners have thin tips, which are slightly rounded. If they are too thin they will cut the metal. They are used in the initial marking out of the design, and in the finishing stages to refine any thin outlines. Planishers have smooth, flat tips which are used for pushing out large, flat areas of metal. Matting tools have patterns cut into them, and provide detail to areas of the design. Matting tools can also be made by filing a thin line around a steel bar, hardening it, then snapping it. This will result in a fine grain pattern. Doming tools push out rounded areas of metal, and can either be round or oval, quite pointed or almost flat. An <b>oxyacetylene</b> <b>torch,</b> coal forge or propane forge is required for heating the steel sufficiently for forging. The more tools available, the easier it is to create a detailed, accurate piece.|$|E
40|$|The {{oxidation}} resistance of various (Zr or Hf) B 2 -based ceramics {{will be tested}} in order to evaluate their respective performances in both furnace and <b>oxyacetylene</b> <b>torch</b> environments.

By understanding the local heat flux and oxygen conditions, experiments are designed so that graphite ablation rates can be measured as a function of heat flux and partial pressure of oxygen. Further investigation shows that composition of the material influences the temperature response where ultra-high temperature ceramics exhibit the lowest surface temperatures. Using thermal gravimetric analysis, the isothermal oxidation behavior of ultra-high temperature ceramics from 1000 - 1600 °C is investigated using a Dynamic Non- Equilibrium method {{in order to understand the}} reaction kinetics of ZrB₂-SiC where parabolic rate constants are determined. Isothermal oxidation behavior is compared to non-isothermal mass gain and oxide scale formation where specimens oxidized isothermally gain 3 times more mass and have oxide scales 4 times as thick. Finally, the effect of SiC content in ZrB₂ on temperature during <b>oxyacetylene</b> <b>torch</b> testing is determined.
