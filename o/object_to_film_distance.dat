40|$|Background: Increasing {{the x-ray}} focus <b>to</b> <b>film</b> <b>distance</b> (FFD) has been {{advocated}} {{as an effective}} method to reduce the patients’ radiation dose. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the efficacy of this technique in patients' dose and image quality in pediatric chest x-ray. Material and methods: Sixty pediatric patients were x-ray imaged at FFDs of 100 and 130 cm. Dose measurements were performed using thermo-luminescent dosimeters (GR 200). The quality of images was independently assessed using the anatomical criteria recommended by the European guidelines. Results: Increasing the FFD from 100 to 130 cm has reduced the entrance skin dose (ESD) of patients by 32. 2 % (p 0. 05). Conclusion: Increased FFD to 130 cm reduce the pediatric radiation dose with no significant changes in image quality...|$|R

To confirm aspects of the proposed model, the behaviour of 001 slices of initially single-domain RTA, patterned with periodic Ag electrodes of spacing 38 mm, as for periodic poling in non-linear optics, were investigated using synchrotron X-ray section topography with the electric field applied in situ while under X-ray illumination at the ID 19 topography beamline of the ESRF, Grenoble. The results of white-beam section topography as both a function of crystal <b>to</b> <b>film</b> <b>distance,</b> and under DC voltage are reported, confirming that there is a bending of the planes in the near-surface region. The strain in the near-surface region was examined directly using high-resolution monochromatic X-ray section topography.

40|$|Background and Aim: The basic aim in {{radiography}} is {{to acquire}} a good image from the body organs, but never {{the issue of the}} patient's protection against the harmful effects of ionizing radiation should be neglected. One of the most important factors for assessing the radiation risk is the dose received by sensitive organs such as gonads. Radiation damage to the gonads can be lead to genetic damages at the progeny of the radiated individuals, and that damage can be transmitted to the next generation. Materials and Methods: In this study the thermoluminescence dosimeters were used to measure the entrance skin dose. DAP values for each examination and also the patients information such as age,  size, weight and machine setting like that mA, time, kVp and focal spot <b>to</b> <b>film</b> <b>distance</b> were recorded. By means of PCXMC software version 2 gonadal doses were calculated. Results: The maximum dose received by the testicles was for the pelvis AP projection, 0. 45 mGy and for the ovaries maximum dose was for abdomen PA, 0. 306 mGy. The minimum dose received by the testicles and ovaries was for lumbar LAT 0. 065, 0. 101 respectively. Conclusion: One of the ways for patient and gonadal dose reduction is to use appropriate shields for radiosensitive organs such as gonads. Hence its recommended to use appropriate shields for gonads because of their high radiosensitivity...|$|R
