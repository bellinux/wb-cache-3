5|$|Although {{underlain}} by {{much older}} Triassic age formations that protrude to form what would <b>once</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> islands—such as Athelney, Brent Knoll, Burrow Mump and Glastonbury Tor, which {{is composed of}} Blue Lias, the lowland landscape was formed only during the last 10,000years, {{following the end of}} the last ice age. As the sea level changed following the Pliocene era, vegetation was laid down which was later converted into peat. The peak of the peat formation took place in swamp conditions around 6,000years ago, although in some areas it continued into medieval times.|$|E
5|$|Like the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy has {{satellite}} galaxies, {{consisting of}} 14 known dwarf galaxies. The best known and most readily observed satellite galaxies are M32 and M110. Based on current evidence, {{it appears that}} M32 underwent a close encounter with the Andromeda Galaxy in the past. M32 may <b>once</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a larger galaxy that had its stellar disk removed by M31, and underwent a sharp increase of star formation in the core region, which lasted until the relatively recent past.|$|E

Plant {{species such as}} foxtail barley, saltgrass, rabbitbrush, cattails and other reeds are still found in small pockets along the river. Exotic pasture grasses such as orchard grass, bluegrass, redtop bentgrass, quackgrass, wheatgrass and fescue have become the common species of grass. The vulnerable flower, Ute's Ladies'-tresses, {{can also be found}} along the river.|$|E

5|$|Although {{underlain}} by {{much older}} Triassic age formations that protrude to form what would <b>once</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> islands—such as Athelney, Brent Knoll, Burrow Mump and Glastonbury Tor—the lowland landscape was formed {{only during the}} last 10,000years, {{following the end of}} the last ice age. Glastonbury Tor is composed of Upper Lias Sand. The Poldens and the Isle of Wedmore are composed of Blue Lias and Marl, while the Mendips are largely Carboniferous limestone. Although sea level changes since the Pliocene led to changes in sea level and the laying down of vegetation, the peak of the peat formation took place in swamp conditions around 6,000years ago, although in some areas it continued into medieval times.|$|E
5|$|Evanton is {{in close}} {{proximity}} to the site of Balconie Castle, an old seat of the Mormaers and Earls of Ross. By the early modern period, the area was dominated by the Munros of Foulis (Foghlais), who had their Foulis Castle just a few kilometres away. Indeed, the latter began to bury their family at Kiltearn after 1588. The Cille place-name in Kiltearn tells us {{that there had been a}} very ancient Gaelic church near Evanton, like all Cille place-names, founded before 800. The current Gaelic name Cill Tighearna ("Church of the Lord") is probably a corruption of an older form, both because the name formation is unusual in being dedicated to the Lord Himself, and because the form given in 1227 is Kiltierny, suggesting some kind of connection to Tigernach in Ireland. Other suggestions have included a dedication to St Ternan. The church lay next to the lordly residence of Balconie. By the later Middle Ages, Balconie was one of the five lordships of Ross, as well as an individual seat of the Earls of Ross. Place-name evidence suggests that the site may <b>once</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a Pictish residence. A charter granted by Aodh, Earl of Ross in 1281 records the name Petkenny, but a charter of 1333 refers to a location called Balkenny. The development of the name Pitlochry, where Pictish Pit- is replaced by Gaelic Baile, suggests the names are the same, but the great early twentieth century toponymist William J. Watson was doubftful.|$|E

Reingot's version, published in Petrucci's Canti C, uses Ockeghem's superius transposed down an octave in the tenor voice and has three florid, quick-moving contrapuntal voices around it.|$|E

25|$|Decades {{into the}} desktop {{publishing}} revolution, few typographers with metal foundry type experience are still working, and few digital typefaces are optimized specifically for different sizes, so {{the misuse of}} the term display typeface as a synonym for ornamental type has become widespread; properly speaking, ornamental typefaces are a subcategory of display typefaces. At the same time, with new printing techniques, typefaces have largely replaced hand-lettering for very large signs and notices that would <b>once</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> painted or carved by hand.|$|E
25|$|Postumus {{was used}} by both patrician and plebeian gentes, {{including}} the Aebutii, Antistii, Cominii, Livii, Mimesii, Plautii, Sempronii, Sulpicii, and Veturii; and naturally it must <b>once</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used by the ancestors of gens Postumia. Other gentes which later {{used it as a}} cognomen may originally have used it as a praenomen. Because it was not a common name, there are few examples of the feminine form, but Marcus Terentius Varro listed it together with other archaic praenomina that were no longer in general use by the 1st century BC, and Plutarchus mentions that it was given to the youngest daughter of the dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla, who lived during Varro's time.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} costing/valuation {{of inventory}} can be complex. Whereas {{in the past}} most enterprises ran simple, one-process factories, such enterprises are quite probably in the minority in the 21st century. Where 'one process' factories exist, there is a market for the goods created, which establishes an independent market value for the good. Today, with multistage-process companies, there is much inventory that would <b>once</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> finished goods which is now held as 'work in process' (WIP). This needs to be valued in the accounts, but the valuation is a management decision {{since there is no}} market for the partially finished product. This somewhat arbitrary 'valuation' of WIP combined with the allocation of overheads to it has led to some unintended and undesirable results.|$|E

25|$|Much of {{the area}} that the Mission blue once {{inhabited}} has been destroyed. The coastal sage and chaparral and the native grassland habitats have seen unnatural human development {{in much of the}} region. The San Mateo County town of Brisbane lies in what may <b>once</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the prime habitat for the butterfly. Near Brisbane, an industrial park and rock quarry have proved damaging to the Mission blue habitat. Generally, the most negative impact is that of residential and industrial development. Aside from development, other human activities have negatively affected the butterfly's habitat. Those activities include cultivation and grazing as well as the oft human assisted abundance of invasive exotic species. Some of the more impactful exotics include the European gorse and pampas grass. In the Golden Gate Recreation Area, thoroughwort is a particular invasive species which is taking over habitat once occupied by the Mission blue's lifeblood, the three species of lupine. Of the threats facing the Mission blue, habitat loss due to human intervention and exotic, invasive species are the two most critical.|$|E
25|$|From {{the western}} side of the ruins, the abbot's hall window remains the {{dominant}} structure, but walls of the kitchen and dining areas and of the main cloister are easily made out beyond it. It is possible to walk through the entrance to the undercroft of the frater or refectory, below the great west refectory window, which would <b>once</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> an impressive structure when it was inserted in the 13th century. The refectory and its undercroft separated the little cloister to the south from the larger northern cloister. The undercroft was the main storage area for provisions, which were brought in through its western entrance from the abbey grounds. A sluice supplied by a stream is on the northern side of the undercroft. The undercroft linked via service steps to the frater above, and by a door to the kitchens, which lay along {{the western side}} of the little cloister. The large fireplaces in the west wall of the kitchen range are still very prominent. The frater, being on the upper floor, has gone, but the main cloister wall closest its entrance has two large, arched niches that contained the lavers for the canons' ceremonial ablution before meals. It is not clear how water was supplied to the lavers and all trace of the wash basins has disappeared.|$|E

A further 15th century barn to the west of The Priory is now ruined, following a fire in 1969. It is close to the circular Dovecote which may date from the 14th century.
