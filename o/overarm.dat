5|$|Takanohana {{was largely}} a yotsu-sumo wrestler, favouring {{techniques}} which involved grabbing his opponent's mawashi or belt. His preferred grip was migi-yotsu (right hand inside, left hand outside his opponent). His most common winning kimarite by far was yori-kiri, a simple force out, which accounted for 52 percent of his victories. He also regularly employed uwatenage, or <b>overarm</b> throw, {{and this was the}} technique he used to defeat Asashōryū in the second of their two meetings, in September 2002.|$|E
5|$|The Port Phillip {{team were}} favourites {{before the game}} began. This was partly owing to their bowlers' use of <b>overarm</b> bowling at pace; by contrast, bowlers in Tasmania {{preferred}} underarm bowling {{at a time when}} roundarm bowling was permitted {{in the rest of the}} world. The match was played at the Launceston Racecourse ground, but the state of the ground was such that the umpires were unsure of the best place to pitch the wickets. The Victorian team were dismayed by the state of the pitch, which looked extremely difficult to bat on, and later received an apology from the government of Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|John Marshall was {{the captain}} of the Van Diemen's Land team and William Philpott led the Port Phillip team, which batted first. The Victorian team found the home bowling {{difficult}} to face, on account of its unusually slow pace; in their first innings, they scored 82. Van Diemen's Land replied with 104, assisted by a large number of extras. The batsmen coped better than expected with the <b>overarm</b> bowling, although Thomas Antill took three wickets in four balls in returning figures of seven wickets for 33 runs. Batting again, the Victorian team scored 57, leaving the Tasmanian team needing 36 to win. When the first day's play ended due to bad light, Van Diemen's Land had scored 15 runs and lost six wickets. The next morning, the home team scored the required runs for the loss of one more wicket, recording a three-wicket victory. The match, which had been keenly anticipated, was a great attraction and was followed closely in the press in Melbourne. Additionally, there were many social events for the visiting team.|$|E
5000|$|For {{several days}} the maquis {{had known that}} {{an attack on the}} camp was imminent, through {{information}} that had come to them about German troop movements. However, on the morning of 9 September 1944, [...] "Achille", head of the maquis, left the camp to make contact in Eloyes with Major Brown, head of the Franco-British mission. On arrival at the village, he was arrested by a German patrol, interrogated and held in the former post office building near the hospice. He was freed the same evening. Lieutenant Romann, head of the first [...] "hundred" [...] was likewise away from the maquis since he had left the camp beforehand with an <b>overarmed</b> group.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT—Four hundred twenty-five fossil decapods, {{preserved}} in apatite concretions, were col-lected from the Early Campanian Gammon Ferruginous Member of the Pierre Shale in Butte County, South Dakota. The fauna, {{confined to a}} 4. 3 meter interval of rock and mapped over eight square kilometers, {{is dominated by the}} mud shrimp Protocallianassa russelli n. sp. (74. 5 % of decapod fauna), the crab Necrocarcinus davisi n. sp. (14. 6 %), and the lobster Hoploparia mickelsoni n. sp. (9. 5 %), but includes four other crabs: Dioratiopus hearttailensis n. sp. (1. 2 %), Raninella oaheensis Bishop, 1978 (0. 5 %), Xanthosia elegans occidentalis n. sp. (0. 5 %), and Rugafarius fred-richi n. gen., n. sp. (0. 2 %). This group of decapods is considered to be an assemblage, the Proto-callianassa-Necrocarcinus-Hoploparia Assemblage, because of similarities to the Dakoticancer Assemblage in faunal characteristics, mode of preservation, and geographic and stratigraphic dis-tribution. This assemblage predates the migration of Dakoticancer <b>overarms</b> Rathbun into the Western Interior and the consequent development of the Z) aA:o?zcancer Assemblage, which contains descendents of taxa in the Protocallianassa-Necrocarcinus-Hoploparia Assemblage, repeatedly present in the Upper Pierre Shale...|$|R
40|$|Roland Marchal — The mooryaan of Mogadiscio: Forms of Violence in a War-Torn Urban Area. From December 1990 till December 1992, the Somalian {{capital was}} the scene of {{fighting}} and violence that had less and less to do with political strategies. Using data from the field, the author has investigated the actors in this fighting and inquired into their social trajectories so as to shed light on some issues in this cri-sis, at least in the urban setting. There, a 'culture of pillage' provides the roles that <b>overarmed</b> adolescents may demonstratively play out. A society in war is being restructured by warfare. Social relations and politics, as practised by com-peting factions, are becoming criminal. Brief comparisons show that the mooryaan cannot be reduced to forms of social violence such as the warenleh, shifta, or Becker's 'outsiders'. Questions are raised about the future of this social group, which, following the December 1992 military intervention, is rapidly evolving toward a more classical form of delinquent violence.

5|$|Most {{commonly}} {{employed as}} a right-handed opening batsman, Sainsbury was one of Somerset's most talented batsman during their formative years. His slow underarm bowling was effective in second-class cricket, but {{in an era when}} <b>overarm</b> bowling was becoming the standard, he was used sparingly in the first-class game. During his time at Somerset, the county gained first-class status. After being led for three seasons by Sainsbury's Lansdown team-mate Stephen Newton, Sainsbury was given the Somerset captaincy for the 1885 season. A combination of poor results {{and not being able to}} raise a full eleven during that season led to the county's removal from the first-class game, although Sainsbury remained as captain until 1888. By the time Somerset had improved sufficiently to return to first-class cricket in 1891, Sainsbury had moved to neighbouring county Gloucestershire, where he saw out his county cricket career.|$|E
25|$|After {{some change}} in 1828, the 1835 code legitimised roundarm bowling, and {{prevented}} <b>overarm</b> bowling by penalty of No ball (see also 1835 English cricket season). The previous Laws did not disbar either, {{but had been}} interpreted variously by umpires reflecting custom and practice, at some cost to the careers of the bowling innovators. Further changes were made in 1845, and in 1864 bowlers were finally free to bowl <b>overarm.</b>|$|E
25|$|Underarm bowling still {{plays a role}} in {{informal}} garden cricket games, {{which are}} often played by less athletic people or young children. Novices at playing the game are often unable to bowl <b>overarm</b> effectively or accurately, so can be allowed to bowl underarm by general consensus. Since underarm bowling is also slower than <b>overarm,</b> it is easier for novice batsmen to hit the ball, making it ideal for informal and children's cricket.|$|E
25|$|Underarm bowling did not cease, {{even if it}} {{had been}} superseded. In fact, underarm survived roundarm. Underarm as a {{tactical}} alternative to <b>overarm</b> continued into the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Bowling is done underarm (as in softball), {{rather than}} <b>overarm</b> as in {{international}} cricket. This change {{came about because}} underhanded-bowled balls are less painful if they contact with a player.|$|E
25|$|Underarm bowling did not cease, {{even if it}} {{had been}} superseded. In fact, underarm survived roundarm. Underarm as a {{tactical}} alternative to <b>overarm</b> continued into the twentieth century with George Simpson-Hayward being the last major exponent.|$|E
25|$|Although underarm bowlers did not fade away, roundarm {{became the}} {{predominant}} style until another controversy erupted about <b>overarm</b> in 1864. Prominent roundarm bowlers to succeed Lillywhite and Broadbridge were Alfred Mynn, John Jackson and W. G. Grace.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1860s, roundarm had {{replaced}} underarm {{as the standard}} form of bowling but <b>overarm</b> was still illegal, {{even though it was}} in use. Laws were modified in 1845 in an attempt to limit the ever increasing height of the bowlers arm. On 26 August 1862 at The Oval, Willsher became the first cricketer to be no-balled for bowling <b>overarm.</b> Playing for an England XI against Surrey he was called six times by umpire John Lillywhite for delivering the ball with his hand above his shoulder. Willsher left the field with eight of his professional colleagues (the two amateurs in the England team remained on the field) and play was abandoned {{for the rest of the}} day. When Lillywhite refused to accept the legality of Willsher's action, he was replaced as umpire so that the game could continue. Willsher went on to take 6 for 49. As a result of this incident, which may well have been planned in advance to force the issue, the laws were changed and <b>overarm</b> was legalised from the beginning of the 1864 season. Meanwhile, the 1863 season saw another 80 wickets for Willsher, as well as 494 runs with the bat, including three half-centuries. The runs scored during the season, and his highest score of 89, would remain his career best.|$|E
25|$|The 19th century saw underarm bowling {{superseded}} by first roundarm and then <b>overarm</b> bowling. Both developments were controversial. Organisation {{of the game}} at county level {{led to the creation}} of the county clubs, starting with Sussex in 1839. In December 1889, the eight leading county clubs formed the official County Championship, which began in 1890.|$|E
25|$|In 1864, another bowling {{revolution}} {{resulted in}} the legalisation of <b>overarm</b> {{and in the same}} year Wisden Cricketers' Almanack was first published. W. G. Grace began his long and influential career at this time, his feats doing much to increase cricket's popularity. He introduced technical innovations which revolutionised the game, particularly in batting.|$|E
25|$|Walter William Read (born 23 November 1855 in Reigate, Surrey, died 6 January 1907 in Addiscombe Park, Surrey) was an English cricketer, {{who was a}} fluent {{right hand}} bat. An {{occasional}} bowler of lobs, he sometimes switched to quick <b>overarm</b> deliveries. He captained England in two Test matches, winning them both. Read was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1893.|$|E
25|$|Each Companion cavalryman was {{equipped}} with a 3-metre double-ended spear/lance with a cornel wood shaft called the xyston. The double spear points meant that, should the xyston break during a battle, the rider need only turn his weapon around to re-arm himself. The Thessalian and Greek cavalry would have been armed similarly to the Companions. The xyston was used to thrust either <b>overarm</b> or underarm with the elbow flexed. This is usefully illustrated in the Alexander Mosaic, King Alexander is shown thrusting with his xyston underarm, whilst immediately behind him a cavalryman is employing the <b>overarm</b> thrust. There {{is no evidence that}} the Macedonian cavalry ever used a two-handed grip on their lances, as did later Sarmatian and Roman lancers. The shaft of the xyston was tapered allowing the point of balance, and therefore the hand grip, to be approximately two thirds of the length of the spear away from the point. During the reign of Alexander the Great most cavalrymen did not carry shields. However, the Companion cavalry of the Antigonid dynasty did carry large, round bossed shields of Thracian origin.|$|E
25|$|Taihō {{was noted}} for his skill and power when {{he grabbed his}} opponents' mawashi or belt– {{techniques}} known as yotsu-sumo. His preferred grip was hidari-yotsu, a right hand outside, left hand inside position. His most common winning move was yori-kiri, a straightforward force out, which accounted for about 30 percent of his wins. His most frequently used throws were sukuinage (the beltless scoop throw) and uwatenage (the <b>overarm</b> throw).|$|E
25|$|The dispute {{was about}} a point of {{principle}} and centred {{on the right of}} bowlers to use an <b>overarm</b> action, which had been legalised ahead of the 1864 season. Consequently, with several important players missing, Yorkshire did not win a game in 1865 and were forced to cancel some matches for the 1866 season. The Yorkshire Committee and the players came to an understanding in early 1867 after the players apologised, but Anderson never represented the county again.|$|E
25|$|In cricket, roundarm bowling is {{a bowling}} style that was {{introduced}} {{in the first quarter of}} the 19th century and largely superseded underarm bowling by the 1830s. Using a roundarm action, the bowler has their arm extended about 90 degrees from their body at the point where they release the ball. Roundarm fell into decline after 1864 when the current style of <b>overarm</b> bowling was legalised, although W. G. Grace continued to use it to the end of his career.|$|E
25|$|Edgar “Ned” Willsher (22 November 1828 in Rolvenden, Kent – 7 October 1885 in Lewisham, London) was an English cricketer {{known for}} being a {{catalyst}} in the shift from roundarm to <b>overarm</b> bowling. A left-handed bowler, and useful lower-order batsman, Willsher played first class cricket for Kent between 1850 and 1875. He took over 1300 first-class wickets, despite only having one lung. He led a tour of Canada and the United States in 1868, and after retiring from his playing career became an umpire.|$|E
25|$|In 1854, Surrey {{secured a}} new 21-year lease {{on their home}} ground and Surrey went on to enjoy an {{exceptionally}} successful decade. being “Champion County” seven times from 1850 to 1859 and again in 1864. In 1857, all nine matches played by the county resulted in victory. This was the time of great players like William Caffyn, Julius Caesar, HH Stephenson and Tom Lockyer, and a fine captain in Frederick Miller. An incident in 1862, at the instigation of Edgar Willsher in a match between Surrey and England, led {{to the introduction of}} <b>overarm</b> bowling into cricket.|$|E
25|$|Kotomitsuki was a yotsu-sumo wrestler, and his {{favourite}} {{grip on the}} mawashi was migi-yotsu, {{with his}} left hand outside and right hand inside his opponent's arms (although he was also capable of fighting in the reverse position, hidari-yotsu). His most common winning kimarite by far was yori-kiri, the force out, followed by oshi-dashi (push out) and hataki-komi (slap down). He was fond of dashinage (pulling throws, both <b>overarm</b> and underarm), and {{was also one of the}} few rikishi to employ uchi-muso, a technique which involves tapping the opponent's inner thigh with the back of the hand to off-balance him, before twisting him down.|$|E
25|$|Wakanohana {{was noted}} for his {{wide range of}} techniques, winning the prestigious Ginō-shō prize on six occasions. His {{favourite}} grip on his opponent's mawashi was hidari-yotsu, a right hand outside, left hand inside position. His most common winning kimarite was yorikiri, or force out, followed by oshidashi or push out. Together these two techniques accounted for almost fifty percent of his career victories. He had knowledge {{of a wide range}} of throwing moves, such as uwatenage (<b>overarm</b> throw), shitatenage (underarm throw), sukuinage (scoop throw) and kubinage (neck throw), as well as extremely rare techniques such as amiuchi (the fisherman's throw), kawazugake (hooking backward counter throw) and susoharai (rear footsweep).|$|E
25|$|Whereas roundarm and <b>overarm</b> {{were highly}} {{controversial}} and {{were introduced in}} the face of fierce opposition, {{there is nothing in the}} historical records which precisely dates the introduction of pitching and nothing which indicates that it was controversial. It has been suggested that the change effectively created a different code of cricket, just as there are now two different codes of rugby football, though in cricket the new completely superseded the old. The two eras are bridged by the career (c.1749 to c.1774) of John Frame, one of the game's first great bowlers, who played with pioneers like Thomas Waymark, Richard Newland and Robert Colchin at the beginning of his career and with pre-modernists like John Small and Lumpy Stevens at the end.|$|E
25|$|Baruto had a {{solid and}} {{straightforward}} yotsu-sumo style, concentrating on techniques which involved grabbing the opponent's mawashi or belt. He preferred a migi-yotsu grip, {{with his right hand}} inside and left hand outside his opponent's arms. His most common winning kimarite or technique was overwhelmingly yori-kiri, or force out. Due to his great strength he was known for using tsuri-dashi, or lift out, a technique which has declined in recent years because of the increasing weight of wrestlers. Baruto used this technique three times in the July 2009 tournament alone. He also frequently used uwatenage, or <b>overarm</b> throw. He was forced to change his yotsu style in his successful ōzeki promotion basho of March 2010, as his thumb injury meant he was less effective on the mawashi, and he used a more aggressive slapping and thrusting attack instead.|$|E
500|$|The team {{representing}} Port Phillip, generally named [...] "Victoria" [...] in the press, {{was drawn}} from the Melbourne Cricket Club. The Van Diemen's Land team, designated [...] "Tasmania" [...] in newspapers, consisted of players from both Launceston and Hobart. The visiting team was expected to have an advantage {{through the use of}} fast <b>overarm</b> bowling. Cricket in Victoria was also considerably more advanced than in Tasmania, whose bowlers operated underarm. The match, intended to be played to a finish with no limits on time, took place on a pitch that made batting difficult. As was usual practice at the time, overs comprised four deliveries and there was no set boundary.|$|E
500|$|For Tasmania, Gervase Du Croz and Marshall {{opened the}} batting to the fast roundarm bowling of Lister and Hamilton. They batted for an hour—described {{in the press}} as {{displaying}} [...] "brilliant steady batting"—without being dismissed, at which point, with the score at 25, a lunch break was taken. After the interval, they maintained their partnership for another 30 minutes before Antill, who had replaced Hamilton in the bowling attack, bowled Du Croz; he had scored 27 in 93 minutes and the partnership was worth 40 runs. William Field, who replaced Du Croz, was bowled by the first ball he faced. The new man, George Maddox, scored a single from his first ball; Marshall was then caught at point, having batted 105 minutes for 13 runs. Antill had taken three wickets in four balls. Maddox was bowled by Antill after scoring one, then Hamilton bowled George Gibson for eight. Walter Westbrook, the next man in, survived for forty minutes but struggled to score, only managing three scoring shots in that time before Antill bowled him. Wickets fell steadily: Charles Arthur, bowled by Antill, scored one; John Tabart, bowled by Hamilton, scored two, and Henty was bowled by Antill for a duck. The last batsman, McDowall, batted effectively to score ten runs before he was caught by Antill at mid-on off Hamilton's bowling. Vincent Giblin remained not out, having batted {{for a half hour}} for seven runs. The Van Diemen's Land innings ended for 104, a lead of 22 over Port Phillip, after 160 minutes and 32 overs. Antill had taken seven wickets for 33 runs while Hamilton took three for 24. Before the match, the Tasmanians had been expected to struggle against the <b>overarm</b> attack of the Victorians, and Antill had performed effectively; yet the Tasmanians were helped by a large total of 24 extras (which included 11 byes and eight no-balls).|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the period, bowling {{reached the}} final stage of its {{evolution}} as <b>overarm</b> began with the same sort of controversy that had accompanied the introduction of roundarm. [...] But this time the controversy was short-lived and <b>overarm</b> was rapidly adopted and legalised between 1862 and 1864.|$|E
2500|$|Roundarm did {{not mean}} the end of underarm, which {{continued}} well into the <b>overarm</b> era that began in 1864. [...] William Clarke, founder of the All England Eleven in 1845, remained a highly effective underarm bowler long after roundarm began. [...] Others who sometimes bowled underarm into the <b>overarm</b> era were James Grundy and James Southerton.|$|E
2500|$|In cricket, <b>overarm</b> bowling {{refers to}} a {{delivery}} in which the bowler's hand is above shoulder height.|$|E
2500|$|The drain of {{manpower}} and economic resource to the Seven Years' War might explain {{the paucity of}} matches but another cause {{could have been the}} sort of rows that accompanied the implementation of both roundarm and <b>overarm.</b> It must have been in the decade or so before 1770 that bowlers stopped trundling the ball along the ground and started pitching it. It is feasible to suggest that some patrons may have withdrawn their support in disgust at such a radical change and even that whole teams may have refused to play each other. Strangely, in contrast to the bitterness and fury generated by the later roundarm and <b>overarm</b> controversies, the sources are very quiet about the pitching issue.|$|E
2500|$|An {{interesting}} {{historical development}} of the legalisation of <b>overarm</b> was that for many years, 1864 was deemed to mark the start of [...] "first-class cricket" [...] which suggested that earlier cricket was [...] "second-class". [...] The 1864 origin has been strongly challenged: see also First-class cricket.|$|E
2500|$|In the July 2005 tournament Kotoōshū {{defeated}} Asashōryū for {{the first}} time with an <b>overarm</b> (uwatenage) throw, bringing to an end a run of 24 consecutive bout victories for the yokozuna. He also was the runner up in the tournament, winning an [...] "outstanding performance" [...] sanshō prize.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the advent}} of {{developed}} biomechanical and audiovisual technology, this law was implemented by the field umpires, who judged a delivery as illegal or [...] "thrown" [...] on visual judgement alone. The law against throwing has not changed in its essence since <b>overarm</b> bowling was legalised in 1864.|$|E
