5|$|Between 2001–2010, <b>Oriel</b> College {{students}} {{chose not}} to be affiliated to the University-wide Students' union, OUSU, although this did not stop some students from getting involved with OUSU and running for elected office. In a 2010 student referendum the JCR decided to reaffiliate. However, in 2013, in a fresh referendum, the <b>Oriel</b> JCR again voted to disaffiliate from OUSU.|$|E
5|$|This is a convex {{quadrilateral}} of buildings, {{bordered by}} the High Street, and {{the meeting of}} <b>Oriel</b> Street and King Edward Street in <b>Oriel</b> Square. The site took six hundred years to acquire and although it contains teaching rooms and the Harris Lecture Theatre, it is largely given over to accommodation.|$|E

5|$|<b>Oriel</b> College is a {{constituent}} {{college of the}} University of Oxford in Oxford, England. Located in <b>Oriel</b> Square, the college has {{the distinction of being}} the oldest royal foundation in Oxford (a title formerly claimed by University College, whose claim of being founded by King Alfred is no longer promoted). In recognition of this royal connection, the college has also been known as King's College and King's Hall. The reigning monarch of the United Kingdom (since 1952, Elizabeth II) is the official Visitor of the College.|$|E

50|$|The {{gatehouse}} and tower were additions by abbot John Newland around 1500. The gatehouse is {{embellished with}} two-storey <b>oriels</b> with mullion and transom windows, two-storey statuary niches and panelled parapets. These structures were restored by John Loughborough Pearson in 1888, who succeeded in retaining {{many of the}} features of their original design. He restored the <b>oriels,</b> which at some point had been replaced by sash windows. The single-storey eastern extension is also 19th century.|$|R
5|$|Seven {{copies of}} the 1300 {{exemplification}} by Edward I survive, in Faversham, <b>Oriel</b> College, Oxford, the Bodleian Library, Durham Cathedral, Westminster Abbey, the City of London (held in the archives at the London Guildhall) and Sandwich (held in the Kent County Council archives). The Sandwich copy was rediscovered in early 2015 in a Victorian scrapbook in the town archives of Sandwich, Kent, one of the Cinque Ports. In {{the case of the}} Sandwich and <b>Oriel</b> College exemplifications, the {{copies of the}} Charter of the Forest originally issued with them also survive.|$|E
5|$|Several hôtels particuliers (large townhouses) {{date from}} the Renaissance. Most of them have <b>oriel</b> windows that are {{characteristic}} of German Renaissance architecture. The grandest of these hôtels belonged to the Ebersmunster abbey {{and it has a}} large three-story granary. The Ziegler house has a beautiful <b>oriel</b> that shows the interest of the elite of that time in Antiquity. The <b>oriel</b> partly reflects Vitruvius's architectural legacy and displays the portraits of four key figures of Antiquity. Baroque architecture is visible on some later hôtels dating from the 17th and 18th century. French classical architecture and its main feature, the mansard roof, were largely employed in the 18th century. To reduce costs, buildings were still built with timber framing, but as this technique was considered too Germanic and rustic, they were often covered with a rendering imitating stone.|$|E

2500|$|This steel {{structured}} [...] "skyscraper" [...] {{was designed}} by Bloomington architect George Miller and {{is an example of}} Chicago Style architecture. The design incorporates many elements which would later be connected to what is now called the Sullivanesque Style, after Louis Sullivan. Sullivan concentrated on many of design elements seen in the Livingston Building. On its north and east side the building is decorated with pressed metal <b>oriels.</b> The lower base of the building makes use of columns and is top is ornamented by a detailed cornice. The Livingston Building's <b>oriels</b> are arranged in a curtain wall where they are located on the building. Above the first story the windows are flanked by pressed metal spandrels and the third through sixth floors are clad in red brick. One of the <b>oriels</b> faces Washington Street and two face Main Street. The windows are supported by terra cotta brackets and the upper spandrels are ornamented with terra cotta paneling.|$|R
5|$|The Tortoise Club {{is open to}} the 1st Summer VIII and 1st Torpid (as well {{as their}} {{respective}} coxwains), but does not extend to the Boat Club committee's Bosun (boatswain), Secretary, or Treasurer unless they are also 1st VIII, 1st Torpid, or coxwains to those boats. The unique emblem of the Tortoise Club is the tortoise badge. The College of Arms' narrative should not be misunderstood to imply use of the Tortoise emblem by the general <b>Oriel</b> College Boat Club membership or members of the <b>Oriel</b> Society – these have their own appropriate emblematic devices.|$|E
5|$|The grounds {{also contain}} remains of Lincoln's Eleanor cross, an <b>oriel</b> window moved from Sutton Hall and {{incorporated}} into the main gate, and the bust of George III from the Dunston Pillar.|$|E

60|$|Such {{conversations were}} not without danger to poor Mary's comfort. It came {{soon to be}} the case that she looked rather for this sort of sympathy from Beatrice, than for Miss <b>Oriel's</b> {{pleasant}} but less piquant gaiety.|$|R
5|$|The general {{emblem of}} the <b>Oriel</b> College Boat Club is the {{original}} medieval badge of Edward, the Black Prince. In recent years this has been augmented {{by the addition of}} crossed-oars below the feathers.|$|E
5|$|This {{was added}} to the south of the Great Hall in the early 16th century to provide a small {{intimate}} room where the family could eat in private away from the servants. Above it is the small <b>Oriel</b> Bedroom, probably originally a dressing room for the Great Chamber as its only entrance is via that room. At {{the same time that the}} <b>oriel</b> room and bedroom were added, rooms were added or remodeled to the south of the Great Hall: the Great Parlour with Great Chamber above, and the Little Parlour with Little Parlour above. John Lyte, the builder, placed his coat of arms on the outside of the building.|$|E
5|$|A second Feast Day {{was added}} in 2007 by a benefaction from George Moody, {{formerly}} of <b>Oriel,</b> {{to be celebrated}} on or near St George's Day (23 April). The only remaining gaudy had been Candlemas; the new annual dinner was {{to be known as}} the St. George's Day Gaudy. The dinner is black tie and gowns, and by request of the benefactor, the main course will normally be goose. The inaugural event took place on Wednesday 25 April 2007.|$|E

60|$|But {{directly}} she was gone, Miss <b>Oriel's</b> tone of banter ceased. It {{was very}} well making a fool of a lad of twenty-one when others were by; but there might be danger in it when they were alone together.|$|R
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the façade conception of the Viennese Town Hall of Hauberrisser's teacher Friedrich von Schmidt, Hauberisser's facades in Munich and St. Johann are flat and are given life by the relief effect of balconies, <b>oriels,</b> columns, statues and decorations.|$|R
5|$|As {{originally}} built, the Federal-style {{house had}} three stories. The completed house had {{four or five}} parlors. It was built of unpainted, cream-colored brick. The entrance was level with the ground, with an <b>oriel</b> window above it {{on the second floor}} and a Palladian window on the third floor above that. An oval portico protected visitors arriving at the front doors.|$|E
5|$|Behind the High Table is a {{portrait}} of Edward II; underneath is a longsword brought to the college in 1902 after being preserved for many years {{on one of the}} college's estates at Swainswick, near Bath. On either side are portraits of Sir Walter Raleigh and Joseph Butler. The other portraits around the hall include other prominent members of <b>Oriel</b> such as Matthew Arnold, Thomas Arnold, James Anthony Froude, John Keble, John Henry Newman, Richard Whately and John Robinson.|$|E
5|$|Changes {{brought about}} in the <b>Oriel</b> Blazer Act of 2009 to become more {{inclusive}} of lower-boats' alumni (3rd, 4th, and sometimes 5th VIII's as well as boat coxswains) reformed the cuff ring designations as follows: Three rings for 1st Summer VIII; two rings for 1st Torpid and a blades-winning 2nd Summer VIII at the Captain's discretion; one ring for general boat club members (no specific distinction for committee members exists today).|$|E
5|$|As it {{is about}} ten minutes walk from College and more {{peaceful}} than {{the middle of the}} city, it has become the principal choice of accommodation for <b>Oriel's</b> graduates and finalists. The site has its own common rooms, squash court, gymnasium and support staff.|$|R
60|$|After {{that there}} had been the Christmas vacation, and Mary had again found {{discretion}} to be the better part of valour. This was doubtless disagreeable enough. She had no particular wish to spend her Christmas with Miss <b>Oriel's</b> aunt instead of at her uncle's fireside. Indeed, her Christmas festivities had hitherto been kept at Greshamsbury, the doctor and herself having made a part of the family circle there assembled. This {{was out of the question}} now; and perhaps the absolute change to old Miss <b>Oriel's</b> house was better for her than the lesser change to her uncle's drawing-room. Besides, how could she have demeaned herself when she met Frank in their parish church? All this had been fully understood by Patience, and, therefore, had this Christmas visit been planned.|$|R
