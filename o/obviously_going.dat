25|$|The {{process of}} {{emission}} and absorption of photons seemed {{to demand that}} the conservation of energy will hold at best on average. If a wave containing exactly one photon passes over some atoms, {{and one of them}} absorbs it, that atom needs to tell the others that they can't absorb the photon anymore. But if the atoms are far apart, any signal cannot reach the other atoms in time, and they might end up absorbing the same photon anyway and dissipating the energy to the environment. When the signal reached them, the other atoms would have to somehow recall that energy. This paradox led Bohr, Kramers and Slater to abandon exact conservation of energy. Heisenberg's formalism, when extended to include the electromagnetic field, was <b>obviously</b> <b>going</b> to sidestep this problem, a hint that the interpretation of the theory will involve wavefunction collapse.|$|E
25|$|To {{bolster the}} Tasmanian team Colin McDonald of Victoria was shipped over with Jim Burke, Norm O'Neill and Peter Philpott of New South Wales. Terence Cowley won the toss {{and put the}} MCC in to bat rather than face Frank Tyson, Fred Trueman, Peter Loader and Ted Dexter on a green wicket in English-style conditions. Willie Watson (43) and Arthur Milton (83) put on 99 for the first wicket, Peter May (80) and the out-of-form Colin Cowdrey (72) 123 for the fifth wicket and the M.C.C batted into the second day before declaring on 384/9, Cowley taking 5/92. McDonald used a heavy bat and made 104 before he threw his wicket away in what was <b>obviously</b> <b>going</b> to be a draw. No other batsman made 30 and the wickets were shared around {{five of the seven}} bowlers used, Tyson (3/60) being the best, though Trueman took a good one-handed catch off Mortimore to dismiss O'Neill for 20. The {{tourists}} batted out the last afternoon, Watson making 42 and Graveney 52 in their 162/4.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Brian Lowry of Variety said: [...] "Despite a pedigree that includes Arrested Development creator Mitch Hurwitz {{and many of}} that program's stars, Sit Down seldom rises above sniggering double entendre." [...] Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club graded the episode B, saying: [...] "I'm staying optimistic that the characters {{are going to get}} fleshed out in upcoming episodes, because this is <b>obviously</b> <b>going</b> to be a character-based ensemble comedy." [...] Jonah Krakow of IGN was more positive about the episode, noting the [...] "familiar aspects" [...] of [...] Arrested Development, such as the [...] "deft wordplay, biting sarcasm and inappropriate humor". He concluded, saying: [...] "As long as the talented cast can continue to play to their strengths and the scripts can humorously tackle dicey subject matter, this should continue to be a very entertaining show." [...] Kona Gallagher [...] of TV Squad watched the episode twice, and said that it [...] "definitely grows on you." [...] She concluded, saying: [...] "In all, I think the first time you watch Sit Down, Shut Up, it's really easy to blow it off as another animated show that's trying too hard. However, it's actually worth sticking around and watching a couple of episodes." ...|$|E

(vii) While {{a player}} is serving {{and until the}} service has been taken by an “out” player, the server’s partner must stand between {{the wall and the}} “over” line; {{provided}} that he does not move out of this area, he may prevent a serve not going out over the side lines with his bat or his hand, but not in any other way. The same applies to any service which is <b>obviously</b> not <b>going</b> “over”.|$|R
60|$|Then with {{infinite}} caution, Marmaduke de Chavasse {{worked his}} way between the trees towards the old wall which encircled his park. The three men <b>obviously</b> would be <b>going</b> back either to Acol Court, or mayhap, straight to the village.|$|R
2500|$|The {{band members}} are Christians {{and in an}} {{interview}} with the BBC, Josh Farro stated [...] "Our faith is very important to us.

2500|$|Hudson, {{known as}} the [...] "Railway King" [...] was concentrating on {{connecting}} his portfolio of railways so as to join Edinburgh with the English network. His Newcastle and Berwick Railway obtained its authorising Act of Parliament in 1845, but {{for the time being}} it was to use the Newcastle and North Shields Railway's station at Carliol Square. Building a crossing of the Tyne was <b>obviously</b> <b>going</b> to be a lengthy process, so that he gave the construction of the general station a low priority. The Tyne crossing became the High Level Bridge.|$|E

Notwithstanding {{the strong}} policy {{arguments}} in favor of establishing this privilege and the serious harm that would be caused by its absence, no such protection had ever been held to exist. Not only was the concept that the judicial system was entitled to 'every man's evidence' itself deeply rooted in the Constitution, but merely determining the scope of the privilege (when would it apply?) and identifying who would receive it (only regularly employed journalists? freelancers? anyone?) were difficult matters at best."

5000|$|Commings let it {{be known}} that he wanted the job badly, and he even came to Iowa to {{campaign}} for it. At one of these rallies, Commings told reporters, [...] "I feel I can win at Iowa. <b>Obviously,</b> it's <b>going</b> to take football players, but I don't feel anybody has a better rapport with the high school players than me. We have always had a very sophisticated football program at Massillon. My coaching staff (nine men) is larger than at most colleges." ...|$|R

After all, as you can imagine, I'm a human being. I'm a father, I'm a hockey dad, I'm a businessman, I'm a community leader. I'm <b>obviously</b> not <b>going</b> to be revelling in the deaths of anybody." ...|$|R
25|$|They {{come across}} a {{procession}} in which a young Indian woman, Aouda, is led to a sanctuary to be sacrificed by sati the next day by Brahmins. Since the young woman is drugged with opium and hemp and is <b>obviously</b> not <b>going</b> voluntarily, the travellers decide to rescue her. They follow the procession to the site, where Passepartout {{takes the place of}} Aouda's deceased husband on the funeral pyre on which she is to be burned. During the ceremony he rises from the pyre, scaring off the priests, and carries the young woman away. The twelve hours gained earlier are lost, but Fogg shows no regret.|$|R
2500|$|Nirvana taped its {{performance}} for MTV Unplugged on November 18, 1993, at Sony Studios in New York City. Cobain {{suggested that the}} stage be decorated with stargazer lilies, black candles, and a crystal chandelier. Cobain's request prompted the show's producer to ask him, [...] "You mean like a funeral?", to which the singer replied, [...] "Exactly. Like a funeral." [...] Nirvana was augmented by guitarist Pat Smear and cellist Lori Goldston, who had been touring with the band. Despite the show's premise, Cobain insisted on running his acoustic guitar through his amplifier and effects pedals. Coletti built a fake box {{in front of the}} amplifier to disguise it as a monitor wedge. Coletti said, [...] "It was Kurt's security blanket. He was used to hearing this guitar through his Fender. He wanted those effects. You can hear it on 'The Man Who Sold the World.' It's an acoustic guitar, but he's <b>obviously</b> <b>going</b> through an amp." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 2009/10 season, Tahir {{moved from}} the Titans to the Dolphins. This was {{due to a lack of}} {{first-class}} cricket with the club, who preferred to play 23-year-old leg-spinner Shaun von Berg. When Tahir was called into South Africa's squad for the final Test against England, national coach Mickey Arthur said [...] "I'm not entirely sure what the issues are between him and the Titans, but the Titans <b>obviously</b> aren't <b>going</b> to pick him because they'd rather pick the young leggie they have". He holds the record for representing highest number of teams (27) in the world. He moved to the Highveld Lions in 2012.|$|R

50|$|Tony Havelock-Allen {{was running}} a {{production}} company, Constellation Films. Daniel Birt was an editor who wanted to direct and brought Interrupted Journey to the company. Havelock-Allen was married to Valerie Hobson {{at the time and}} he also felt the movie might make a good vehicle for Richard Todd who had just become a star with The Hasty Heart. The producer later recalled:I didn't think much of the project, {{but if you have a}} company you have to do something, because the money keeps on going out. It had no success at all, however. Daniel Birt was <b>obviously</b> not <b>going</b> to be a great director; editors can always make films but only the very talented ones can make good films.|$|R
60|$|Although they {{travelled}} almost {{night and}} day, {{it took them}} {{the better part of}} two weeks to reach the river, on the banks of which King Hudibras' chief town was built. They arrived at the eastern bank without mishap, and found that people were crowding over from the western side to attend some display or fete which was <b>obviously</b> <b>going</b> on there. Mingling with the crowd they went to the river's edge, where numerous wooden canoes and coracles were busily engaged in ferrying the people over.|$|E
60|$|The voyage was <b>obviously</b> <b>going</b> to pay, but {{the strange}} thing was, their cargo {{for the most}} part had come down after the agent died. To some extent this bore out Marston's {{conclusion}} that the old mulatto was the Bat and had power over Don Felix's uncivilized customers. Marston began to muse about the fellow. He had power; one felt it, although he was old and repulsive. Something indicated that he had inherited from his white ancestors qualities not often found in half-breeds. Marston began to see that this was partly why the fellow repelled him; one got a hint of intelligence put to a base use.|$|E
60|$|His {{feelings}} that night differed considerably {{from the frame}} of mind {{in which he had}} gone to bed the night before. It was partly a very excellent dinner and partly the fact that Psmith's flat, though at present in some disorder, was <b>obviously</b> <b>going</b> to be extremely comfortable, that worked the change. But principally it was due to his having found an ally. The gnawing loneliness had gone. He did not look forward to a career of Commerce with any greater pleasure than before; but there was no doubt that with Psmith, {{it would be easier to}} get through the time after office hours. If all went well in the bank he might find that he had not drawn such a bad ticket after all.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with AbsolutePunk regarding {{the sound of the}} album, rhythm guitarist Mike Kennerty stated [...] "Pop radio is literally just pop music now. There’s no guitars to be found, so we kind of saw that coming. It’s a different place and we made a different record. It’s not like a singles record, it’s actually a record. That was our concentration from when we were recording. We knew we were making a fucking record. Fuck the normal system of singles and all that stuff. <b>Obviously,</b> it’s <b>going</b> to get worked by the label, but we wanted to make something we were proud of as a record, first and foremost, and we did that." ...|$|R
50|$|The North British Railway was {{involved}} with the company financially and in the Board of the D&QR, but by now it had become obvious within the NBR that the way forward was a Forth Bridge. The expenditure on that scheme would be huge, and any money diverted to connecting the Queensferry route would be wasted. The NBR nominees on the D&QR Board were instructed to do all they could to slow the rate of progress of the planning and construction of the railway. In June 1874 the NBR prevarication {{came to a head}} when the D&QR directors re-issued the company's prospectus, and decided to go it alone without the promised NBR financial support, which was <b>obviously</b> not <b>going</b> to be made available.|$|R

Hamlin appeared in victory lane to celebrate his sixth win {{of the season in}} front of 95,000 people who attended the race. Hamlin also earned $219,975 in race winnings, and he later expressed his confidence heading into the Chase: [...] "It's been an up-and-down year, but there's been a lot of ups, and <b>obviously</b> we're <b>going</b> to enter this Chase No. 1. It means a lot to this whole race team. A lot of people bashed this race team about 'can't finish this, and can't finish that.'

We might have broken through if we had had a few more minutes, though the strong-room must have been already flooded, but the lamp fell as she reeled when a roller struck her, and we were left in darkness with the water washing about our feet. It drove us out and she was <b>obviously</b> <b>going</b> down when we waded across the after-deck. A boat lay under the quarter, but it was swept clear as soon as I dropped on board, and as we lurched away on the long swell there was a heavy crash. Then a blue light flared up and showed us other boats, and only half the wreck left, looming black amid spouting foam.|$|E
60|$|The {{faces of}} some of the Welsh people, among whom there were many old persons, were {{certainly}} the least intelligent. Some of these emigrants would have bungled sorely, but for the directing hand that was always ready. The intelligence here was unquestionably of a low order, and the heads were of a poor type. Generally the case was the reverse. There were many worn faces bearing traces of patient poverty and hard work, and there was great steadiness of purpose and much undemonstrative self-respect among this class. A few young men were going singly. Several girls were going, two or three together. These latter I found it very difficult to refer back, in my mind, to their relinquished homes and pursuits. Perhaps they were more like country milliners, and pupil teachers rather tawdrily dressed, than any other classes of young women. I noticed, among many little ornaments worn, more than one photograph-brooch of the Princess of Wales, and also of the late Prince Consort. Some single women of from thirty to forty, whom one might suppose to be embroiderers, or straw-bonnet-makers, were <b>obviously</b> <b>going</b> out in quest of husbands, as finer ladies go to India. That they had any distinct notions of a plurality of husbands or wives, I do not believe. To suppose the family groups of whom the majority of emigrants were composed, polygamically possessed, would be to suppose an absurdity, manifest to any one who saw the fathers and mothers.|$|E
