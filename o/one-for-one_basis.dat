5|$|The Oerlikon 20 mm {{anti-aircraft}} gun, one of {{the most}} heavily produced anti-aircraft guns of the Second World War, entered service in 1941, and replaced the /90 M2 Browning MG on a <b>one-for-one</b> <b>basis.</b> Between December 1941 and September 1944, 32% of all Japanese aircraft downed were credited to this weapon, with the high point being 48.3% for the second half of 1942; however, the 20mm guns were found to be ineffective against the Japanese Kamikaze attacks used during the latter half of World War II and were subsequently phased out in favor of the heavier Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft gun.|$|E

40|$|Sugars have a {{long history}} of safe use in foods. They are common food {{ingredients}} that add taste appeal and perform important functions in foods. Besides its pleasant sweetness, sugar performs a host of less obvious and important functions in cooking, baking, candy making and the like. As carbohydrates, sugars are a contributor of calories for the body. The ability to produce solutions of varying degrees of sweetness is important in many food applications, particularly in beverages and confectionery. Low-calorie sweeteners add a taste that is similar to that of sucrose. Intense sweeteners are generally several times sweeter than sucrose. On the other hand, sugar replacers are the bulk and volume providing sweeteners usually less sweet than and different tasting from sugar, commonly used on a <b>one-for-one</b> replacement <b>basis</b> for sugar in recipes. Sugars have been studied extensively for their impact on a variety of issues...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject catalog}} of the University of Colorado Medical Center Library is {{examined}} in considerable detail. Annual {{revisions of the}} subject catalog required by annual revisions of the subject heading authority list used, NLM's MeSH, are analyzed in terms of man-hours required for the effort and {{the effect on the}} catalog's structure. It is contended that, in a divided catalog, changes of headings on a <b>one-for-one</b> equivalency <b>basis</b> are no more difficult than they would be in a computerized catalog, but that in many-for-one changes the manual catalog and the machine catalog face exactly the same dilemma and in the same magnitude, the only solution in either case being the reexamination of many entries. The proliferation of subheadings is shown to present particularly vexing problems in catalog revision. A plea is made to recognize the MeSH system for what it is, a legitimate compromise between the descriptor-oriented terms of a computer coordinate-indexing system, and the subject-heading-oriented terms of the conventional card catalog...|$|R

Equipment common to all roles would be built into the ship, while mission specific payloads would be built into modules, which could be fitted into standardised slots aboard the ship when needed. This modular payload system came to be known as [...] "Standard Flex", or [...] "StanFlex" [...] for short.|$|E
2500|$|By mid-December 1950, the United States was {{discussing}} {{terms for}} {{an agreement to}} end the Korean War. The desired agreement would end the fighting, provide assurances against its resumption, and protect the future security of UNC forces. The United States asked there needed to be a military armistice commission of mixed membership that would supervise all agreements. Both sides would need to agree to [...] "cease the introduction into Korea of any reinforcing air, ground or naval units or personnel ... and to refrain from increasing the level of war equipment and material existing in Korea." [...] The U.S. also desired to make a demilitarized zone that would be roughly 20 miles wide.

2500|$|In September 2007, The Times-Picayune {{reported}} that Vitter and the Bush administration opposed a provision of The Gulf Coast Housing Recovery bill which required that every public housing apartment torn down {{be replaced with}} another form of low-income housing on a <b>one-for-one</b> <b>basis.</b> The administration testified {{that there was not}} sufficient demand for public housing units, a position contested by several senators. Vitter stated it would recreate [...] "housing projects exactly as they were", isolated and riddled with crime. However, Mary Landrieu, the Louisiana Democratic Senator, said the intent was to make certain there were affordable places for working-class people who returned. The bill requires that demolished housing projects be replaced with mixed income communities which local housing advocates say is different from the massive public housing developments that Vitter is referring to. However, the bill does not include a ban on large-scale projects. The city housing authority is planning on replacing 4,000 low-income units with mixed-income projects providing a smaller inventory of low-income units. In December 2007, Vitter prevented the bill from leaving the committee.|$|E
2500|$|From {{continuing}} to use sterling after independence (1922), the new Irish Free State brought {{in its own}} currency from 1928. [...] The new [...] (Free State) Pound was defined by the 1927 Act to have exactly the same weight and fineness of gold as was the sovereign at the time, having the effect of making the new currency pegged at 1:1 with sterling. [...] rather than , parity with sterling was maintained for another fifty years. As with sterling, the £sd system was used, with the Irish names [...] (plural: [...] ), [...] (plural: [...] ) and [...] (plural: [...] ). Distinctive coins and notes were introduced, the coins from 1928 (in 8 denominations: d farthing, d halfpenny, 1d penny, 3d threepence, 6d sixpence, 1s shilling, 2s florin, 2s 6d half crown and in 1966 a 10s coin) all with the same dimensions as their British counterparts. However, the pound sterling generally continued to be accepted on a <b>one-for-one</b> <b>basis</b> everywhere, whereas the Irish currency was not generally accepted in the United Kingdom.|$|E
2500|$|The Army placed {{importance}} on the GCV's {{ability to carry}} a full nine-man squad. [...] Numerous Army studies have concluded that a squad, containing two fireteams, should be composed of nine to eleven soldiers. [...] These numbers allow the squad to accomplish the fire and maneuver doctrine, and for squad resilience, lethality, and leader span of control. [...] The M2 Bradley cannot carry a complete squad from one vehicle, creating risk when transitioning from mounted to dismounted operations. [...] The Bradley's lower carrying capacity was accepted for greater (than previous vehicles) mounted lethality and cost savings, leading to squads being broken apart for transport. [...] A GCV with a nine-man squad would have allowed the squad leader to control and communicate with the squad while mounted, simplify the transition to dismounted operations in complex terrain, and allow the squad to conduct independent fire and maneuver immediately upon dismount. [...] Replacing the Bradley on a <b>one-for-one</b> <b>basis</b> would have four GCVs per mechanized infantry platoon carrying one full nine-man squad in a single vehicle, with three vehicles carrying squads and one carrying the platoon's organic and attached enablers.|$|E
