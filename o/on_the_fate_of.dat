5|$|There {{had already}} been public debate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> retired cricketers, and {{counties}} had improved pay and conditions for their professional players. For example, several counties, including Yorkshire, had instituted winter pay before Pullin's writings were published. However, former players did not benefit from these reforms.|$|E

5|$|In Scotland, Anne {{sometimes}} exploited court factionalism {{for her own}} ends, {{in particular}} by supporting the enemies of the Earl of Mar. As a result, James did not trust her with secrets of state. Henry Howard, active in the highly secret diplomacy concerning the English succession, subtly reminded James that though Anne possessed every virtue, Eve was corrupted by the serpent. In practice, Anne was little interested in high politics unless they touched <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> her children or friends.|$|E
5|$|Pompey, Julius Caesar and Augustus all {{visited the}} tomb in Alexandria, where Augustus, allegedly, accidentally knocked the nose off. Caligula {{was said to}} have taken Alexander's {{breastplate}} from the tomb for his own use. Around AD200, Emperor Septimius Severus closed Alexander's tomb to the public. His son and successor, Caracalla, a great admirer, visited the tomb during his own reign. After this, details <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> the tomb are hazy.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to England, Spurr {{worked as a}} journalist. In 1952 The London Daily Express sent him to Japan as its China and Far East correspondent, but he found that he had little time to resume his pursuit of information <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> Yamato. In the mid-1970s Spurr returned to the Far East again, this time as {{a writer for the}} Far Eastern Economic Review. He began conducting interviews about Yamato with former Japanese naval commanders and survivors of the battleship's last mission. He also gained access to Japanese naval documents and records seized by the United States, plus US interrogation transcripts. For the American side of the story, he interviewed US naval commanders and personnel involved in the sinking of Yamato. Satisfied with what he had, Spurr began writing the book in the late 1970s, over 30 years after he first found out about the battleship.|$|E

5|$|For his {{selection}} of sailing master, Hall first turned to Sidney O. Budington, then to George Tyson, who both initially declined due to prior whaling commitments. When those commitments fell through, Hall named Budington as sailing master and Tyson assistant navigator. Budington and Tyson had decades of experience between them captaining whaling vessels. In effect, the Polaris now had three captains, a fact which would weigh heavily <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> the expedition. Further complicating matters, in 1863 Budington and Hall had quarrelled because Budington had denied permission for Hall {{to bring his}} Inuit guides, Joseph Ebierbing and Tookoolito, with him on an expedition {{at a time when}} they were ill and in Budington's care.|$|E
5|$|The 1999 Academy Honorary Award recipient, Polish film {{director}} Andrzej Wajda, whose father, Captain Jakub Wajda, {{was murdered in}} the NKVD prison of Kharkiv, made a film depicting the event, Katyn (2007). It focuses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> some of the mothers, wives and daughters of the Polish officers killed by the Soviets. Some of the Katyn Forest executions were re-enacted. The screenplay is based on Andrzej Mularczyk's book Post mortem—the Katyn story. The film was produced by Akson Studio, and released in Poland on 21 September 2007. It was nominated for an Academy Award in 2008 for the Best Foreign Language Film.|$|E
5|$|As {{the force}} which {{was sent to}} {{reinforce}} and extract the reconnaissance platoon took further casualties, the total Croatian losses in the fighting and its immediate aftermath amounted to 20 killed. The fate of the reconnaissance platoon was not immediately known to Croatian authorities or relatives of the troops for months, adding fuel to an already volatile atmosphere {{in the city of}} Bjelovar, where the 105th Brigade was originally based. This tension erupted a week later, with the blockade and capture of the JNA barracks in Bjelovar. The JNA denied it had any knowledge <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> the Croatian soldiers. Details of their deaths became known in December 1991. Croatian forces recaptured Kusonje on 30 December in Operation Papuk-91, and their bodies were exhumed in January 1992. Along with the soldiers, the bodies of 23 civilians were also exhumed from a mass grave in the village of Rakov Potok. The soldiers were re-interred in Bjelovar on 5 February 1992. According to JNA intelligence reports, during the period from the exhumation to the re-interment, 32 Serb-owned houses in Bjelovar were demolished in retribution for the killings.|$|E

All six were released until further notice but if convicted they could face a five-year prison sentence.|$|E
25|$|The Eastern Orthodox Church celebrates several All Souls' Days in the year, {{but in the}} West {{only one}} such annual {{commemoration}} is celebrated. The establishment, {{at the end of}} the 10th century, of this remembrance helped focus popular imagination <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> the departed, and fostered a sense of solidarity between the living and the dead. Then, in the 12th century, the elaboration of the theology of penance helped create a notion of purgatory as a place to complete penances unfinished in this life.|$|E

Through days of intense negotiation, exercising extreme caution and courtesy, Zhou was largely successful in reconciling their positions.|$|E

50|$|The tragic plot is {{varied with}} some {{elements}} of comic relief, from two sources.
