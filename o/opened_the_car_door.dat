2500|$|The first {{shooting}} {{attributed to}} the Son of Sam occurred in the Pelham Bay area of the Bronx. At about 1:10a.m. on July 29, 1976, Donna Lauria, 18, and her friend Jody Valenti, 19, were sitting in Valenti's Oldsmobile, discussing their evening at Peachtree's, a New Rochelle discotheque. Lauria <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>door</b> to leave and noticed a man quickly approaching the car. Startled and angered by the man's sudden appearance, she said, [...] "Now what is this..." [...] The man produced a pistol from the paper bag that he carried and crouched. He braced one elbow on his knee, aimed his weapon with both hands, and fired. Lauria was struck by one bullet that killed her instantly. Valenti was shot in her thigh, and a third bullet missed both women. The shooter {{turned and walked away}} quickly, without saying a word.|$|E
2500|$|After George Balanchine {{was hired}} by the Ballet Russe, he was {{attracted}} to Tallchief professionally and personally. She, however, was unaware of his attraction: [...] "It {{never occurred to me that}} there was anything more than dancing on his mind... It would have been preposterous to think there was anything personal." [...] Although their relationship became more personal, it was a shock to Tallchief when Balanchine asked her to marry him. During the summer of 1945, he asked her to meet him after a Los Angeles performance. Balanchine <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>door</b> for her; when she got in he sat in silence for a moment before saying, [...] "Maria, I would like you to become my wife". [...] "I almost fell out of my seat and was unable to respond", she recalled. [...] She eventually replied, [...] "But, George, I'm not sure I love you. I feel that I hardly know you." [...] He answered that it did not matter, and if the marriage only lasted a few years that was all right with him. After a day to think it over, Tallchief accepted his proposal.|$|E
2500|$|Tatchell {{researched}} the Gukurahundi attacks in Matabeleland in the 1980s, when the Zimbabwean Fifth Brigade attacked {{supporters of the}} Zimbabwe African Peoples Union. He became convinced that Mugabe had broken international human rights law during the attack, which is estimated to have involved the massacre of around 20,000 civilians. Then in 1999, journalists Mark Chavunduka and Ray Choto were tortured by the Zimbabwe Army. The arrest of Augusto Pinochet in London seemed to him a precedent that human rights violations could be pursued against a head of state, thanks {{to the principle of}} universal jurisdiction. On 30 October 1999 Tatchell and three other OutRage! activists approached Mugabe's car in a London street and attempted to perform a citizen's arrest. Tatchell <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>door</b> and grabbed Mugabe. He then called the police. The four OutRage! activists were arrested, on charges including criminal damage, assault and breach of the peace; charges were dropped on the opening day of their trial. Mugabe responded by describing Tatchell and his OutRage! colleagues as [...] "gay gangsters", a slogan frequently repeated by his supporters, and claimed they had been sent by the United Kingdom government.|$|E

He left the house saying {{he was going to}} fetch a newspaper but in reality was going to get his son's present, a toy fire engine, in the trunk of his 1971 Chevrolet Nova. As Donald went to fetch a gun stashed underneath the driver's seat of his car, a gunman pulled <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>door</b> and jammed <b>the</b> machine gun in his face before squeezing off fifteen rounds.|$|R
2500|$|In October 2003, Travis {{escaped from}} the Herolds' car and held up traffic at a busy intersection, {{and was on the}} loose for several hours. [...] The {{incident}} began after a pedestrian threw something at the car that went through a partially open window and struck Travis while they were stopped at a traffic light. [...] Startled, Travis unbuckled his seat belt, <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>door</b> and chased the man, but did not catch him. [...] When police arrived, they lured the chimpanzee into the car several times only to have Travis let himself out of another door and occasionally chase the officers around the car. [...] The 2003 incident led to the passing of a Connecticut law prohibiting people from keeping primates weighing more than 50 pounds as pets and requiring owners of exotic pets to apply for a permit. The new law took effect in 2004, and as of Travis's death, no one in the state had applied to adopt a chimpanzee. The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection did not enforce the law on the Herolds because they had owned 200-pound Travis for so long and because the DEP did not believe Travis posed a public safety risk.|$|E
60|$|The {{afternoon}} {{was only half}} advanced and there were numberless tasks to do. He decided he could think and plan while he worked. As {{he was about to}} turn away he espied another automobile, this one coming from the opposite direction to that Anderson had taken. The sight of it reminded Dorn of the I.W.W. trick of throwing phosphorus cakes into the wheat. He was suspicious of that car. It slowed {{down in front of the}} Dorn homestead, turned into the yard, and stopped near where Dorn stood. The dust had caked in layers upon it. Someone hailed him and asked if this was the Dorn farm. Kurt answered in the affirmative, whereupon a tall man, wearing a long linen coat, <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>door</b> to step out.

As he passed the police car he averted his face, drawing Mackenzie's attention. As a matter of routine, they called him over to question him. The man said {{he was on his}} way home from work, then produced a sawn-off shotgun from the holdall. He ordered White into the back of the car. The policeman <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>door</b> but the gunman snapped,"No time for that, climb the seat"!

When the informant came to his office, he stated to Barbarick that Watson mailed him the card, so that Khoury could purchase him TWA airline tickets with the card. Prior to the case, the informant provided information to the United States Postal Inspection Service 5 to 10 times, all of them being substantiated. These reports also involved Watson. The inspector and informant agreed to set up a sting operation to catch Watson. Upon learning that Watson agreed to send additional cards, the inspector arranged the informant to meet with Watson. A potential meeting was scheduled on August 22, but Watson canceled the appointment. A second meeting took place the day after at a restaurant that was chosen by the informant. The inspector instructed the informant to give a signal to other inspectors if Watson had indeed possessed additional credit cards. Having confirmed that Watson did have additional cards, the informant signaled the inspectors, and they removed him from the restaurant and arrested him. When the inspectors searched Watson's person, no credit cards were found on him. The inspectors then asked Watson if they can search his car, which was near the restaurant, he consented, replying [...] "Go ahead."

5000|$|Another game {{involved}} 10 keys {{with the}} contestant having {{to choose the}} key (with a set number of chances) that <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> large [...] "vault" [...] containing <b>the</b> <b>car</b> inside (similar to The Price Is Rights [...] "Master Key" [...] and [...] "Safe Crackers" [...] pricing games). In 1995, the [...] "vault" [...] changed color from gold to blue. In 1999, a relaunch of the game had all the finalists choose one key each and was expanded to 16 keys, whilst the 2006 relaunch returned to the old format, but with a makeover (it resembled a bank vault and the keys in-game were modeled after real keys). From 1993-95, a giant die rolled from the bleachers {{determine the number of}} keys to pick (a fish bowl was used from 2006-08). If <b>the</b> vault <b>opens</b> in which they pick the winning key number, a siren went off and the contestant wins <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Otherwise, <b>the</b> buzzer will sound if the vault does not <b>open</b> in which <b>the</b> contestant picks the wrong key number (with Don Francisco showing the audience the winning key number in an envelope and, occasionally, using that key to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> vault). There have been multiple occasions where contestants won <b>the</b> <b>car</b> on <b>the</b> first/only key.

During gameplay, whenever contestants are on their sole/final key, Don Francisco would offer a cash prize (up to $2000) in exchange for their key (there have been multiple instances where contestants picked the winning key but took the cash prizes). The final episode in September 2015 had a guaranteed winner of a car, as five members of the audience were allowed to pick a key from a bowl and try it in the door lock. The third contestant was successful.|$|R
50|$|Delia {{was born}} in February 2009 at the Abbott cabin, with Billy and Lily Winters (Christel Khalil) helping deliver her. Since the character's rapid aging, Delia had been kidnapped, and was later {{diagnosed}} with acute myeloid leukemia and {{was in need of}} a bone marrow transplant. All of her relatives get tested to become her donor, but none are a match. Billy, who had left town after marital problems, was unable to be located to be tested. Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) later found him in prison in Myanmar and brought him home, but enlisted the help of Chloe's boyfriend Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart), who would pose as the donor when in fact it would be Billy. The ruse was successful; Delia received the transplant and later recovered from the illness. In 2013, Delia is scheduled to portray the Wicked Witch of the West in her school play of The Wizard of Oz. Billy gets her a dog, whom she names Dash, for the play, angering Chloe. On the way home from the show with Delia in <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> Billy stops at a store to pick up ice cream. While in <b>the</b> store, Delia <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>door</b> and Dash runs away. She runs out into the road to follow him, and is struck by a black SUV.

But Danny does not reveal anything to Vic. They inject Alice with something to put her temporarily to sleep and move her to a deserted, rural warehouse, where they chain her up in a back room. Vic asks Danny for his set of keys to the locks and then drives him to a forest where he says they are {{to pick up the}} ransom. There, Vic confronts Danny about his betrayal, saying he has consigned both himself and Alice to death through it. He says he now intends the hole they had dug for the ransom to be for Danny's body. Danny flees and Vic shoots at him, wounding him. Danny manages to get away and hide. Vic then retrieves the ransom elsewhere and returns to get Alice. He tries to give her an injection, as he has done previously in order to render her unconscious whilst moving her, but the wounded Danny returns as he is doing so, overcomes him and gets his gun. In a stand off between Vic and Danny, Vic reveals to Alice that the two men were lovers. He attempts to use the bond between them to persuade the fatally wounded Danny to put the gun down and be taken to hospital. Danny shoots Vic point blank and then, to Alice's horror, leaves the room, switching off the light on his way out. She is still handcuffed to railings and Vic appears to be dead. However, he revives sufficiently to throw keys to Alice. She manages to unlock her fetters and stagger out through the deserted warehouse. Outside, she finds Danny has not got far. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> he was leaving in is a short distance up the road, the ransom money on the passenger seat and Danny's dead body in the driver's seat. Alice <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>door</b> and drags his body out. The radio is still playing. She looks at the bag of ransom money and drives away.|$|R

500|$|A promotional video, {{directed}} by Dawn of the New Assembly/H5, was produced {{to accompany the}} release of [...] "Juxtapozed with U" [...] as a single. According to Gruff Rhys the band made separate videos for Rings Around the Worlds three singles as they saw the videos included on the DVD release of the album as [...] "pure art" [...] whereas they needed promotional music videos that were more like adverts for the songs. The video is computer generated and begins with stylised shots of traffic moving across the Brooklyn Bridge, New York. The camera zooms in to show a man and women, who appear as thermal images, driving one of <b>the</b> <b>cars.</b> <b>The</b> man checks his watch and puts a CD in <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> stereo before <b>the</b> video switches to an outside shot of the vehicle driving through a tunnel and a busy street. Another street is shown with many neon signs, including one which says [...] "Broadway" [...] and another with features the legend [...] "Juxtapozed with U, Super Furry Animals". The couple continue driving until they reach the Guggenheim Art Museum where they park beside a valet who <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> passenger <b>door.</b> <b>The</b> next shot shows the museum's interior exhibit which consists of a black and neon blue grids with various mathematical symbols and currency signs on the walls. The couple talk {{to one of the}} crowd in the club before leaving the building and walking past the valet to a lift which takes them to a party on the roof of a skyscraper. Shots of a swimming pool on the skyscraper's roof and the couple kissing are intercut with images of fire engines driving through the streets past the Chrysler Building. These fire engines arrive below the skyscraper where the party is taking place and several people, including the couple, look down on them from above. Firemen are shown fighting a blaze on several floors of the skyscraper and a helicopter is seen flying to rescue the partygoers. In the last few seconds of the video the skyscraper explodes and the helicopter crashes into the roof of the building. The Dawn of the New Assembly/H5 video appears on the DVD release of the band's greatest hits album [...] and the Enhanced CD version of the [...] "Juxtapozed with U" [...] single.|$|R
