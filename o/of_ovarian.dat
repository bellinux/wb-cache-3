5|$|In {{addition}} {{to breast cancer}} in men and women, mutations in BRCA2 also lead to an increased risk <b>of</b> <b>ovarian,</b> Fallopian tube, prostate, and pancreatic cancers, as well as malignant melanoma. In some studies, mutations in {{the central part of}} the gene have been associated with a higher risk <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> cancer and a lower risk of prostate cancer than mutations in other parts of the gene. Several other types of cancer have also been seen in certain families with BRCA2 mutations.|$|E

50|$|Benign mucinous cystadenomas compose 80% <b>of</b> mucinous <b>ovarian</b> tumors and 20-25% <b>of</b> benign <b>ovarian</b> tumors overall. The peak {{incidence}} occurs between 30-50 {{years of}} age. Benign tumors are bilateral in 5-10% of cases.|$|R
40|$|Borderline ovarian tumours {{account for}} {{approximately}} 10 to 20 % <b>of</b> all <b>ovarian</b> tumors and have low malignant potential and seen early age at onset.

5|$|However, the {{examination}} of daily moods in women with measuring ovarian hormones may indicate a less powerful connection. In comparison to levels of stress or physical health, the ovarian hormones had less of an impact on overall mood. This indicates that while changes <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> hormones may influence mood, on a day-to-day level it does not influence mood more than other stressors do.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} levels <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> hormones {{at different stages}} of the cycle have been used to explain eating behaviour changes. Progesterone has been shown to promote fat storage, causing a higher intake of fatty foods during the luteal phase when progesterone levels are higher. Additionally, with a high estrogen level dopamine is ineffective in converting to noradrenaline, a hormone which promotes eating, therefore decreasing appetite. In humans, the level of these ovarian hormones during the menstrual cycle have been found to influence binge eating.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect on}} sexual desire is varied, with {{increase}} or decrease in some but with no effect in most. Combined oral contraceptives reduce the risk <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> cancer and endometrial cancer and do not change {{the risk of breast}} cancer. They often reduce menstrual bleeding and painful menstruation cramps. The lower doses of estrogen released from the vaginal ring may reduce the risk of breast tenderness, nausea, and headache associated with higher dose estrogen products.|$|E
50|$|The {{levels of}} S1P (in {{a range of}} 5-40 µmol/L) are 5 to 10 times up-regulated in ovarian cancer patients' ascites.S1P at this {{physiological}} concentration stimulates migration and invasion <b>of</b> epithelial <b>ovarian</b> cancer cells but inhibits migration <b>of</b> normal <b>ovarian</b> surface epithelial cells. Most (more than 90%) ovarian cancers arise from the epithelium of the ovary. Therefore, extracellular S1P could {{have an important role}} in cancer progression by promoting migration <b>of</b> epithelial <b>ovarian</b> cancer cells.|$|R
30|$|There is {{no doubt}} that from the small brown vesicle on the ovarian surface up to the small endometrioma with or without adhesions towards the pelvic wall, {{invagination}} <b>of</b> the <b>ovarian</b> cortex can clearly be demonstrated in each and every case. In contrast with standard laparoscopy, THL allows very detailed inspections <b>of</b> the <b>ovarian</b> endometriotic lesions and as such provides the missing link in the pathogenesis <b>of</b> the <b>ovarian</b> endometrioma, reuniting the hypothesis of Sampson with the observations of Hughesdon.|$|R

5|$|Surgical {{sterilization}} {{is available}} in the form of tubal ligation for women and vasectomy for men. There are no significant long-term side effects, and tubal ligation decreases the risk <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> cancer. Short term complications are twenty times less likely from a vasectomy than a tubal ligation. After a vasectomy, there may be swelling and pain of the scrotum which usually resolves in a week or two. With tubal ligation, complications occur in 1 to 2 percent of procedures with serious complications usually due to the anesthesia. Neither method offers protection from sexually transmitted infections.|$|E
5|$|In the ponerine ant Harpegnathos saltator, worker {{policing}} {{prevents the}} number of reproductive workers from becoming excessive. The species has gamergates, which lay eggs but rarely carry out any other tasks, so having {{too many of them}} would reduce the colony's efficiency. Gamergate numbers are rather stable, as infertile workers target newly ovipositing workers by jumping on and holding them: this efficiently inhibits them from laying eggs, and within a few weeks they revert to being subordinate and infertile workers. However, once new ovipositing workers attain a gamergate's level <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> activity, the infertile (policing) workers ignore them. The signal used by the policing workers consists of cuticle hydrocarbons transmitted only by direct contact, rather than being a pheromone detected by olfaction. Similarly, the inhibition of ovipositing workers is achieved by direct physical aggression by policing workers, not by any pheromone produced by queens or gamergates.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} the {{gestation}} period tends to vary greatly, though 110 days is {{the average length of}} time. In the final stages of pregnancy, dominant females provide their developing offspring with higher androgen levels than lower-ranking mothers do. The higher androgen levels the result of high concentrations <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> androstenedione are thought to be responsible for the extreme masculinization of female behavior and morphology. This has the effect of rendering the cubs of dominant females more aggressive and sexually active than those of lower ranking hyenas; high ranking male cubs will attempt to mount females earlier than lower ranking males. The average litter consists of two cubs, with three occasionally being reported. Males take no part in the raising of young. Giving birth is difficult for female hyenas, as the females give birth through their narrow clitoris, and spotted hyena cubs are the largest carnivoran young relative to their mothers' weight. During parturition, the clitoris ruptures in order to facilitate the passage of the young, and may take weeks to heal.|$|E
50|$|The size <b>of</b> {{the initial}} <b>ovarian</b> reserve is {{strongly}} influenced by genetics. Also, elevated androgen levels during prenatal development have an adverse effect on the early establishment <b>of</b> the <b>ovarian</b> reserve.|$|R
50|$|Known causes <b>of</b> {{premature}} <b>ovarian</b> failure include autoimmune disorders, thyroid disease, diabetes mellitus, chemotherapy, being {{a carrier}} of the fragile X syndrome gene, and radiotherapy. However, in about 50-80% of spontaneous cases <b>of</b> premature <b>ovarian</b> failure, {{the cause is}} unknown, i.e., it is generally idiopathic.|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the vascular changes in ovaries affected by endometriomas 28 women with ovarian endometriosis underwent transvaginal ultrasound with color flow imaging and blood flow analysis <b>of</b> the <b>ovarian</b> artery {{before and after}} laparoscopic conservative treatment <b>of</b> the <b>ovarian</b> cyst. Mean pulsatility index (P. I.) and resistance index (R. I.) <b>of</b> the <b>ovarian</b> artery on the side affected by endometrioma were compared using Student's t-test. Mean P. I. after laparoscopy (1. 59) was significantly lower (p = 0. 001) than before surgical intervention (2. 17). Analogously the mean R. I. was significantly different (p = 0. 001) when compared before (0. 81) and after (0. 73) laparoscopy. Color Doppler velocimetry may add greater understanding <b>of</b> the <b>ovarian</b> hemodynamic changes that occur after conservative surgery on the ovary...|$|R
25|$|A 2015 {{meta-analysis}} {{found that}} {{hormone replacement therapy}} was {{associated with an increased}} risk <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> cancer. The authors concluded that if this association is causal, women using HRT have about one additional case <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> cancer per 1,000 users.|$|E
25|$|The risk <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> cancer {{increases}} {{in women who}} have ovulated more over their lifetime. This includes those who have never had children, those who begin ovulation {{at a younger age}} or reach menopause at an older age. Other risk factors include hormone therapy after menopause, fertility medication, and obesity. Factors that decrease risk include hormonal birth control, tubal ligation, and breast feeding. About 10% of cases are related to inherited genetic risk; women with mutations in the genes BRCA1 or BRCA2 have about a 50% chance of developing the disease. The most common type <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> cancer, comprising more than 95% of cases, is ovarian carcinoma. There are five main subtypes <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> carcinoma, of which high-grade serous carcinoma is the most common. These tumors are believed to start in the cells covering the ovaries, though some may form at the Fallopian tubes. Less common types <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> cancer include germ cell tumors and sex cord stromal tumors. A diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> cancer is confirmed through a biopsy of tissue, usually removed during surgery.|$|E
25|$|Suppression of ovulation, {{which would}} {{otherwise}} cause {{damage to the}} ovarian epithelium and, consequently, inflammation, is generally protective. This effect {{can be achieved by}} having children, taking combined oral contraceptives, and breast feeding, all of which are protective factors. A longer period of breastfeeding correlates with a larger decrease in the risk <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> cancer. Each birth decreases risk <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> cancer more, and this effect is seen with up to five births. Combined oral contraceptives reduce the risk <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> cancer by up to 50%, and the protective effect of combined oral contraceptives can last 25–30 years after they are discontinued. Regular use of aspirin or acetaminophen (paracetamol) may be associated with a lower risk <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> cancer; other NSAIDs do not seem to have a similar protective effect.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the expression of}} matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9) and nuclear factor κappa-B (NF-κB) in different ovarian tissue and explore the relationship between their expression and clinicopathological features <b>of</b> epithelial <b>ovarian</b> cancer. Methods: The expression of NF-κB and MMP- 9 in 15 cases <b>of</b> normal <b>ovarian</b> tissue and 80 cases <b>of</b> epithelial <b>ovarian</b> cancer were detected by mmunohistochemistry PV method. Results: Expression of MMP- 9 and NF-κB in epithelial ovarian cancer {{was significantly higher than}} those in normal ovarian, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0. 05). The expression of MMP- 9 protein was not related to histology classification and differentiation degree, but it was significantly related with lymphatic metastasis and clinical stage (P < 0. 05). The expression of NF-κB protein was significantly associated with histology classification, lymphatic metastasis, clinical stage, and differentiation degree (P < 0. 05). In epithelial ovarian cancer tissue, the expression of MMP- 9 and NF-κB proteins showed a significant positive correlation (P < 0. 01). Conclusion: The expression MMP- 9 and NF-κB proteins are closely related to pathological features <b>of</b> epithelial <b>ovarian</b> cancer and there are important significance to the development, invasion and metastasis <b>of</b> epithelial <b>ovarian</b> cancer. So they might become useful prognostic indicator for diagnosis and prognosis <b>of</b> epithelial <b>ovarian</b> cancer...|$|R
30|$|Another particularity of RCC {{metastasis}} to the ovary is {{the relative}} rarity <b>of</b> bilateral <b>ovarian</b> involvement.

40|$|Approximately 5 - 30 % <b>of</b> the <b>ovarian</b> cancers are metastatic malignancies. The {{prevalence}} <b>of</b> metastatic <b>ovarian</b> tumors {{varies with}} the incidence rates and spread patterns of primary malignancies. We evaluated the prevalence, pre- and postoperative characteristics <b>of</b> metastatic <b>ovarian</b> cancer in Korean women. We reviewed the records for 821 ovarian malignancies with pathological consultation from 1996 - 2006 and recorded patient demographical, radiological, histopathological, and survival data. The study included 112 cases of histologically confirmed metastatic ovarian cancer. Metastatic ovarian cancer accounted for 13. 6 % <b>of</b> all <b>ovarian</b> malignancy, primarily arising from the gastrointestinal tract. The preoperative detection rate with imaging was 75 %, {{and none of the}} radiological or serological features were useful for differential diagnosis. In multivariate analysis for prognostic variables, the only significant factor was the primary tumor site (p= 0. 004). Furthermore, extensive resection increased survival for some patients. The differential diagnosis <b>of</b> metastatic <b>ovarian</b> cancer can be problematic, so multiple diagnostic approaches are necessary. The extent of cytoreductive surgery for this type of tumor must be decided on a case-by-case basis...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} endometriosis, tubal ligation, hysterectomy and epithelial ovarian cancer. Relevant published literatures were searched in PubMed, ProQuest, Web of Science and Medline databases during 1995 – 2016. Heterogeneity was evaluated by I 2 statistic. Publication bias was tested by funnel plot and Egger’s test. Odds ratio and 95 % CI {{were used to assess}} the association strength. The statistical analyses in this study were accomplished by STATA software package. A total of 40, 609 cases <b>of</b> epithelial <b>ovarian</b> cancer and 368, 452 controls in 38 publications were included. The result suggested that endometriosis was associated with an increased risk <b>of</b> epithelial <b>ovarian</b> cancer (OR = 1. 42, 95 % CI = 1. 28 – 1. 57), tubal ligation was associated with a decreased risk <b>of</b> epithelial <b>ovarian</b> cancer (OR = 0. 70, 95 % CI = 0. 60 – 0. 81), while hysterectomy show no relationship with epithelial ovarian cancer (OR = 0. 97, 95 % CI = 0. 81 – 1. 14). A stratified analysis showed there were associations between endometriosis and the increased risk <b>of</b> epithelial <b>ovarian</b> cancer for studies conducted in USA and Europe. Meanwhile, there were associations between tubal ligation and the decreased risk <b>of</b> epithelial <b>ovarian</b> cancer for studies conducted in USA, Asia, Europe and Australia. The result indicated that endometriosis was a risk factor <b>of</b> epithelial <b>ovarian</b> cancer whereas tubal ligation was a protective risk factor <b>of</b> epithelial <b>ovarian</b> cancer, hysterectomy may have no relationship with epithelial ovarian cancer...|$|R
