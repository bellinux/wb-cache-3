500|$|Bleeding Through's The Truth {{album was}} {{released}} on January 10, 2006 through Trustkill Records. The album was produced by Rob Caggiano, lead guitarist of Anthrax. The band decided to rebuild their sound from the ground up, quoting to Alternative Press as [...] "Taking out the Metalcore, and then adding the metal into hardcore, if that makes any sense." [...] (--Scott Danough, guitarist). [...] "I don't think this album sounds like anything else <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>right</b> now. We're {{very proud of that}} fact."

Eurogamer welcomed its introduction of female villagers {{as compared with the}} original male only version. Allgame praised the advanced grouping and path-finding systems in the second release. Despite the improved graphics, Allgame complained that units in Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings were at times difficult to distinguish from one another, a point numerous reviewers agreed on. Nevertheless, Game Revolution wrote that the second release was [...] "the best looking of the 2D RTS games <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>right</b> now." ...|$|E

500|$|Richards was {{surprised}} by the quality of The Age of Kings graphics, considering they were all bitmapped. However, AllGame complained that units were sometimes difficult to tell apart, a point numerous reviewers agreed on. It also called the sound of The Age of Kings as a negative, but not something significant enough to draw players away from the game's overall quality. IGN stated that cutscenes were somewhat bland, but that overall the graphics added [...] "an amazing amount of detail to the actual game". IGN's main criticism was for the in-game speech used in campaigns; it rhetorically asked [...] "why can't they just find a Frenchman to do a French accent?" [...] Alex Constantides of Computer and Video Games rated the graphics highly, saying that some in-game buildings are [...] "so grand you'll even feel guilty about burning them to the ground". Werner agreed; [...] "the most noticeable graphical advancements", he wrote, were [...] "the sheer size and scale of things". Game Revolution stated [...] "AOE2 is the best looking of the 2D RTS games <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>right</b> now".|$|E
500|$|Lauren Carter of Boston Herald {{recommended}} [...] "Breaking Point" [...] as downloadable, and Neil Miller, Jr. of UR Chicago {{called it}} one of [...] "the finest cuts of genuine R <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>right</b> now". Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy called the song [...] "beautiful" [...] and wrote, [...] "While the music has all the squiggly, burping and buzzing percussion sound effects of your typical [...] track, {{it also has a}} lovely Prince-like melody." [...] The Guardian Caroline Sullivan regarded it as [...] "deceptively sugary [...] trilling" [...] and commented that it [...] "does observe that some women 'tolerate too damn much', but it's easily missed". Karen Tye of The Advertiser was mixed and felt that Hilson [...] "invokes" [...] Knowles on [...] "Breaking Point", writing that she [...] "needs to work on establishing her own distinct voice". Negative reviews came from Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone, who named it as one of the album's [...] "failed attempts at pop crossover", and IGN's Chad Grischow, who viewed the ballad as [...] "fed-up". Grischow criticized the production for [...] "clumsily" [...] attempting to mix Motown vocals with voice-box guitars and organs.|$|E

2500|$|Porterfield was {{appointed}} Ireland captain {{at the start}} of the 2008 season, succeeding Trent Johnston.

2500|$|On {{the review}} {{aggregator}} Metacritic, the film {{had an average}} score of 25 out of 100, based on 32 reviews from professional critics. At Rotten Tomatoes, 22% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 122 reviews. The film earned generally negative reviews from movie critics, although some praised Lopez's performance. Stephen Holden of The New York Times said Lopez [...] "holds the screen in a star performance that {{has less to do}} with acting than with embodying a forceful, streetwise woman who stands up for herself", while commenting that its preview had [...] "audience gasping" [...] and [...] "Enough does a better job than most movies of sustaining a mood of palpable physical menace, then confirming your worst fears". On the other hand, Alice King of Entertainment Weekly described the film's plot as [...] "arduously nonsensical" [...] and felt that Lopez lacked connection with her on-screen daughter Tessa Allen, commenting that: [...] "All this to protect a helium-voiced little girl with whom Lopez has so little chemistry, it's as if she's handling garbage rather than a small child." [...] A writer from Contactmusic.com was underwhelmed with the development of the film, noting that the film doesn't [...] "utilize Slim's old friend and romantic interest enough, nor does it develop Slim's real and adopted fathers" [...] while it [...] "uses the tiresome old [...] "kid" [...] cliché. Gracie is, as always, just old enough to understand the situation, but not quite old enough to make an actual impact in the story." [...] However, the writer did praise Lopez in the end sequence, [...] "By the final scenes, despite their obviousness, I was as engrossed in the movie as I could have been, actually rooting for J. Lo to kick some bad guy butt". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: [...] "Lopez has an image of being sexy and tough, but her appeal as an actress is that she's down to earth and that her emotions are accessible. There's nothing cold about her." [...] Additionally, LaSalle felt that [...] "It's the most tension-producing movie <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>right</b> now", stating that [...] "it has the biggest visceral kick, capable of inspiring blood lust in otherwise peaceful viewers.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} conceptual {{tools for}} analyzing {{the practices of}} children´s rights organizations and professionals as transnational citizenship. To this end, {{we set out to}} trace a continuum of citizenship practices where global and local influences and forces enmesh in ways that cannot be grasped if the two are treated as separate realms. To theorize the social dynamism and spatial constitution of transnational citizenship as a local-global continuum, we turn to Bourdieuan field theoretical thinking. By analyzing the handling of the Finnish Periodic Report on children´s rights by the Committee on the Rights of the Child, and the mobilization of its recommendations by Finnish children´s rights advocates, we show that transnational citizenship in the field of children´s rights is practiced not merely <b>out</b> <b>there</b> but also <b>right</b> here. We conclude by discussing what novel insights field theory has to offer to the study of advocacy practices as transnational citizenship. First published online: 25 Oct 201...|$|R

LiPuma also said McCartney wasn't unfamiliar with the group's way of recording, saying that McCartney said [...] "I love this. It reminds me of the way we used to do the Beatles.

2500|$|Casting {{occurred}} {{shortly before}} principal photography began. Etheredge-Ouzts sought a racially diverse cast of handsome {{men who were}} [...] "regular guys" [...] who didn't [...] "play gay". Because the shooting schedule was so tight, actors were cast who did not require rehearsal time. Casting concluded two days before principal photography began, leaving {{just enough time to}} costume the actors. Although the lead character, Eddie, was intended to be Latino, none of the other characters had been written with an ethnicity in mind. However, {{only a small number of}} racial and ethnic minority actors auditioned for the film, and none of them had the requisite acting skills. At one point, Etheredge-Ouzts claimed, 30 non-white actors were scheduled to audition and none of them showed up. This left the production with an all-white cast. The director attributed the lack of interest by minority actor to an unwillingness to play a gay character. Dylan Fergus was cast just two days before principal photography began. Although unhappy with Fergus' haircut, the production team decided against cutting his hair. If the haircut didn't turn <b>out</b> <b>right,</b> <b>there</b> was no time for his hair to grow back.|$|R
