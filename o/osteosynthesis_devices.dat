40|$|Background. Recent {{advances}} in biomaterial technology {{make it possible}} to produce easy-to-handle implants for osteosynthesis with ultra-high strenght and excellent biocompatibility. Biomechanical studies have shown that fixation rigidity achieved with self-reinforced (SR) pins, screws and miniplates is comparable with that of metallic fixation methods. Internal fixation by means of bioabsorbable plates, screws, and pins can be used to stabilize some fractures of small bones in the hand. We report our experience with three cases where internal fixation with a SR (poly-L/DL-lactide 70 / 30; SR-P (L/DL) LA 70 / 30, BioSorbTMFX) miniplates and screws was carried out for stabilization of a metacarpal shaft fracture and thumb replantation. Conclusions. After bone healing is complete, metallic <b>osteosynthesis</b> <b>devices</b> become unnecessary or can even be harmful. Metallic implant-related long-term complications and secondary removal operation are avoided by using of bioabsorbable <b>osteosynthesis</b> <b>devices</b> for metacarpal bones osteosynthesis. </p...|$|E

In this study, we report 25 cases of S. caprae BJI, and we review the 31 cases published in the literature. Molecular techniques and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry improved the identification of clinically relevant S. caprae strains. In this study, 96 % of S. caprae BJIs were localized to the lower limbs, and 88 % of the cases involved orthopaedic device infections. S. caprae joint prosthesis infections (JPIs), internal <b>osteosynthesis</b> <b>device</b> infections (I-ODIs) and BJIs without orthopaedic device infections were recorded in 60 %, 28 % and 12 % of cases, respectively. Ten (40 %) S. caprae BJIs were polymicrobial infections. These infections were associated with past histories of malignancy (p 0. 024). Of the 14 bacterial species related to S. caprae BJI, 57 % were staphylococci. I-ODIs {{were significantly associated with}} polymicrobial infections (p 0. 0068), unlike JPIs, which were monomicrobial infections (p 0. 0344). Treatment with rifampicin and fluoroquinolone was recorded in 40 % of cases. Surgical treatment was performed in 76 % of cases, e. g. prosthesis removal (36 %), <b>osteosynthesis</b> <b>device</b> removal (24 %), and surgical debridement (16 %). Thirty per cent of cases were not treated. Relapses were observed mainly in the patients treated by surgical debridement only (p 0. 033). In summary, S. caprae BJI is an underestimated hospital-acquired emerging infection.

The clinical {{characteristics and}} the choice of treatment strategies of these infections are not obviously known to date. Methods We performed a review of fracture-fixation device infection involving S. lugdunensis managed by our centres. Results Among the 38 cases of fracture-fixation device infection involving S. lugdunensis, 53 % were located in the tibia. Most of our cases (87 %) were chronic infections. Purulent discharge, which occurred in 79 % of cases, was the most frequent clinical symptom, followed by pain in 63 %, local inflammation in 55 %, and fever in 37 %. Bacteremia and severe sepsis occurred in 10 % and 18 % of cases, respectively. Four cases (10 %) were treated exclusively with antimicrobial treatment alone. Thirty-four cases (89 %) were treated {{with a combination of}} surgery with antimicrobial therapy including surgical debridement, antibiotics and <b>osteosynthesis</b> <b>device</b> retention in six cases (16 %), and <b>osteosynthesis</b> <b>device</b> removal in 27 cases (71 %). The mean length of antibiotic treatment was 119 days. The relapse rate was high that was not related to selection of resistant strains. Polymicrobial infection had no impact on clinical outcome. A combination of surgery with antimicrobial therapy was identified as a significant prognostic factor associated with remission (p = 0. 042). Conclusions S. lugdunensis is probably involved in more infections than has been reported.

Their clinical features and prognosis are not clearly known to date. Moreover, no treatment regimen has yet been clarified. We reviewed the streptococcal bone and joint infection cases managed in our centres from January 2009 to December 2013. We described the epidemiology, clinical and microbiologic characteristics, treatment approach and outcome. Among the 93 cases, 83 % of patients were men with a median age of 60 years, and 90 % of patients had comorbidities or risk factors. Bacteraemia occurred in 14 % of cases. Serious complications occurred in six patients, including severe sepsis (two cases) and infective endocarditis (two cases). Orthopaedic device infections were observed in 35 % of cases, including 17 patients with internal <b>osteosynthesis</b> <b>device</b> infection, 14 with prosthetic joint infection and three with vertebral <b>osteosynthesis</b> <b>device</b> infection. The median time between orthopaedic device implantation and onset of infection was 447 days. Fourteen species of Streptococcus were identified, including 97 isolates using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and three isolates using molecular identification. The five most represented species included S.  agalactiae (37 %), S.  dysgalactiae (12 %), S.  anginosus (11 %), S.  constellatus (10 %) and S.  pneumoniae (9 %). Streptococci isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin, {{with the exception of}} one S.  mitis isolate. Remission 1 year after the end of treatment was recorded in 83 %. One patient died of infection; eight patients had infections that failed to respond to treatment; and seven patients experienced relapse. Twenty patients (22 %) had an unfavourable functional outcome, including 19 amputations and one arthrodesis. Five significant prognostic factors associated with an unfavourable clinical outcome were identified, including peripheral neuropathy (p  0. 009), peripheral arterial disease (p  0. 019), diabetes mellitus (p  0. 031), location in the femur (p  0. 0036), location in the foot (p  0. 0475), osteitis without an orthopaedic device (p  0. 041) and infection caused by S.  dysgalactiae (p  0. 020). The rate of poor outcomes remains high despite the low number of Streptococcus isolates resistant to antibiotics.

Há descrições na literatura, de acordo com o método e dispositivo de tratamento, com recomendações que vão desde a descarga total até a proibição do suporte de peso {{corporal}} em ortostase. Existem estudos comparando os dispositivos de osteossíntese e os diversos aspectos cirúrgicos, porém não são encontradas referências que descrevam como e quando se deve liberar a descarga sobre o membro acometido na posição ortostática. OBJETIVOS: Verificar, entre os ortopedistas brasileiros, qual ou quais são os métodos de osteossíntese adotados para o tratamento de fraturas expostas de tíbia, se indicam o tratamento fisioterápico, quando e quais fatores influem para liberar a descarga parcial em ortostase, tanto para a função quanto para a fisioterapia. MÉTODOS: 235 ortopedistas responderam a um questionário durante o XIV Congresso Brasileiro de Trauma Ortopédico. RESULTADOS: Os resultados mostraram que, no Brasil, o dispositivo de osteossíntese mais utilizado é o fixador externo (FE), porém a descarga de peso em pé ocorre mais precocemente quando são utilizadas as hastes intramedulares. A grande maioria dos ortopedistas indica fisioterapia, e o período para liberação de descarga de peso parcial em ortostatismo varia de acordo com o material de síntese utilizado. Conclusões: Concluiu-se que há preferência pelos FEs, a grande maioria indica tratamento fisioterápico e o material de síntese influencia o tempo de liberação de descarga parcial de peso em ortostatismo. BACKGROUND: Tibial shaft fractures are {{the most}} frequent among long bone fractures. They are described in the literature according to the device and method of treatment, with recommendations that range from full weight bearing to non-weight bearing restrictions. There are studies comparing <b>osteosynthesis</b> <b>devices</b> and surgical aspects, but no references were found on how or when to allow weight bearing on the affected limb in the standing position. OBJECTIVES: The present study learned from Brazilian orthopedists which methods of osteosynthesis they use to treat open tibial fractures, whether they refer patients to physical therapy, when and why they allow partial weight bearing for both physical activity and therapy. METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-five orthopedists answered a questionnaire during the 14 th Brazilian Conference of Orthopedic Trauma. Results: The results showed that, in Brazil, {{the most widely used}} osteosynthesis device is the external fixator, but earlier weight bearing while standing occurs when intramedullary nails are used. Most orthopedists refer patients to physical therapy and allow partial weight bearing in the standing position according to the material used for synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that there is a preference for external fixation, that most orthopedists refer patients to physical therapy and that the synthesis material influences restrictions on partial weight bearing...|$|E
40|$|The {{biomedical}} {{technologies for}} bone application {{are employed in}} millions of patients every year to restore function and aesthetics following trauma, diseases and congenital deformities. They achieved significant advancements in the last decades and {{have resulted in the}} development of implants that function for long periods of time. However, some fundamental clinical challenges still remain and are exacerbated by the aging of the population and by the increased life expectancy of the patients. First of all, permanent implants, despite having very high success rates, still face the risk for marginal bone loss and peri-implant osteolysis in some number of cases. Strategies to fasten, to strengthen and to maintain the bone integration of these implants are desired to enhance the implant clinical performances especially in situation of compromised bone. Secondly, the fixation of fractures and the repair of bone defects are required in a large number of clinical situations, where the intrinsic ability of bone to repair itself is limited. A constantly advocated requirement for osteosynthetic devices is the biodegradability, to avoid a second surgery for implant removal or the permanence of the device in the body for long time, with possible adverse effects. However, especially for <b>osteosynthesis</b> <b>devices,</b> materials that possess adequate mechanical properties for load-bearing applications and that biodegrade upon the substitution of new healthy osseous tissue are not yet available. Magnesium (Mg) is a material that offers potential benefits in these clinical issues. Magnesium is a natural component of the human body, which is involved in numerous enzymatic reactions and metabolic processes; thus, it is tolerated at high levels. It has a prominent role in bone homeostasis and bone health in general and it is considered bioactive, osteoconductive and angiogenetic. Therefore it could be applied as a doping agent to permanent implants and bone grafts, to increase their osseointegration. In addition, magnesium is potentially unique in the field of orthopaedic and cranio-maxillofacial surgery because it provides the mechanical properties of metals, although with an elastic modulus closer to that of cortical bone, {{and at the same time}} it degrades under physiological conditions in non-toxic by-products. Based on these clinical needs and on these observations, one aim of the current thesis was to explore the effects of the local release of Mg ions directly at the peri-implant sites on the osseointegration of titanium implants in healthy bone and in bone compromised by osteoporosis. In particular, it was of interest to attempt to elucidate the molecular and biochemical pathways that were stimulated in the peri-implant tissues by the presence of Mg ions and to correlate those to biomechanical and histomorphometrical observation. The other aim of this thesis was to characterize in vivo the degradation behaviour of 3 Mg-alloys tailored for biodegradable <b>osteosynthesis</b> <b>devices</b> and their associated bone response. In Study I to IV, the effects of the local release of Mg ions on the osseointegration of titanium implants in both healthy and osteoporotic bone were investigated. Mg ions were loaded into engineered mesoporous titanium dioxide (TiO 2) carriers coated onto titanium implants. Mesoporous films acted as reservoir of drugs and bioactive substances and released them directly at the implant interface in a sustained fashion. After surface characterization of the mesoporous carriers with and without Mg ions by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), optical light interferometry (IFM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), the same types of implants were implanted in animal models. In Study I, Mg-loaded implants were placed in the hind limb of rabbits for 3 weeks and examined with biomechanical analysis and histology. The results suggested that the increased local availability of Mg could accelerate and strengthen the early bone fixation of titanium implants. In Study II, the activation of biological pathways of bone healing and osseointegration of Mg-releasing implants installed in the rabbit tibia model was investigated at the gene level by means of real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) after 3 weeks in vivo. The results found that several osteogenic markers (OC, RUNX- 2, IGF- 1) were significantly up-regulated in the presence of Mg during the first weeks of healing. This finding was correlated with the histological results, since significantly more threads for the Mg-doped implants were filled with new bone compared to the TiO 2 implants without Mg. In Study III, the performance of Mg-loaded implants in bone was studied at a longer healing time of 6 weeks. It was found that the effects of Mg release are prominent in the early healing phases than compared to the later healing, presumably due to the rapid mobilization of the Mg ions from the coatings. In fact, the expression of osteogenic genes in the bone around control implants were dominantly expressed approximately 3 weeks after the dominant expression in the Mg-loaded group. Within the limitation of the observed healing period, no signs of increased inflammation and activation of bone remodelling were triggered by Mg release. In Study IV, the potential benefits of the local administration of Mg ions on implant osseointegration were tested in ovariectomized rats, which mimicked osteoporotic conditions. The presence of Mg-doped implants in osteoporotic subjects induced a significantly faster new bone formation compared to Ti controls and the activation of BMP 6, an important anabolic agent that is normally suppressed in osteoporosis. In addition, other osteogenic factors, such as VEGF, were up-regulated in presence of Mg. In Study V, 3 recently developed Mg-alloys intended as temporary materials for osthesynthesis applications were tested in vivo to evaluate their degradation behaviour and the response they elicited in tissues. Mg- 2 Ag, Mg- 10 Gd and Mg- 4 Y- 3 RE in the form of mini-screws were implanted in the tibia and femur of rats for 4 and 12 weeks. Their degradation rates were investigated by means of high-resolution synchrotron-based micro computed tomography (SRµCT) and by histological sectioning. The tissue reaction to the different materials was analyzed both on histology and on 3 D reconstructions of the bone-implant samples. In addition, the chemical composition of the degradation layers was assessed with Electron Probe Micro Analysis (EPMA). Finally, the expression of genes in the tissues in proximity of the mini-screws was investigated by means of qPCR employing a super-array technique. The SRµCT enabled the identification of the degradation layers, the original metal and the bone, thanks to the high spatial and density resolution. The 3 -months degradation rates were similar for all materials, but the behaviour of the degradation products differed. The products of Mg- 2 Ag underwent rapid solubilisation. The rapid loss of sample integrity for this material led to fibrous encapsulation, rather than the desired osseous encapsulation. In the other 2 alloys, the degradation layers deposited in the same shape as the original screws and were mainly stable. That allowed the growth of bone in direct contact with the surfaces of the degradation products and they were osseointegrated at the 3 -month healing time. That was confirmed on the histological slides. In addition, the chemical analysis revealed that the degradation products of the alloys were not formed by Mg, but contained Ca, P, C and O in similar amount to the surrounding bone The combination of histological, tomographic and chemical images provided new insight on the nature of the bone-to-implant interface and of the degradation products, which appeared to have great similarities to the host bone. Finally, the analysis of the genes expressed in the peri-implant bone, showed up-regulation of several genes related to osteogenesis around Mg implants compared to Ti ones. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrated that Mg is a suitable doping agent to increase the bone encapsulation of endosseous implants, especially at the early stages of healing and in particular in osteoporotic subjects. That is desirable to shorten the healing period and when early implant loading is considered an option. In addition, Mg- 10 Gd and Mg- 4 Y- 3 RE are biodegradable alloys with a degradation rate and behaviour that is suggested to be suitable for the new bone regeneration and the bone encapsulation...|$|E
40|$|Massive bone {{allograft}} after tumor resection {{has been}} used for over 20 years. Many factors negatively influence the healing of the junction between the allograft and the host hone, resulting in a low healing rate and lengthy time to union. This study evaluated whether pulsing electromagnetic field stimulation could be advantageously used in these patients. A double blind prospective randomized study was designed. Eighty three host graft junctions in 47 patients were considered. The overall host graft junction healing rate was the same (67 %) in both control and active stimulated patients. Although not statistically significant, a positive effect of pulsing electromagnetic fields was observed for those host graft junctions with a cortico-cortical contact between allograft and host bone. When adjuvant postoperative chemotherapy was not employed, a definite effect of pulsing electromagnetic field stimulation was observed: the healing time decreased from 9. 4 months in the control group to 6. 7 months in the active stimulated group (p < 0. 001). This effect would have been lost if chemotherapy was employed. There was also no advantage in supplement with iliac crest autografts at the host graft junction site if chemotherapy was used. Factors that significantly influenced the host graft junction healing rate were: chemotherapy; type of allograft host bone contact; quality of host graft junction; and, in intercalary allografts, use of the <b>osteosynthesis</b> <b>device.</b> No difference was observed between control and active groups for patient survival or number of local or distal tumor recurrences...|$|R
30|$|Nail {{impingement}} {{against the}} anterior femoral cortex during nail insertion, or anterior cortex penetration, {{has been described}} in the literature as a worrying complication. We describe a previously unreported surgical failure due to a compromised dynamic distal locking caused by distal jamming of the nail. An 80 -year-old male suffered a closed right intertrochanteric femoral fracture. Due {{to the presence of}} a long medial fragment, a 240  mm long titanium trochanteric nail was chosen to stabilize the fracture. Dynamic distal locking was performed by placing the distal screw at the inferior rim of the elliptical locking hole to allow compression of the fracture site during weight-bearing. Six-month X-ray follow-up revealed a broken nail and nonunion of the fracture due to failed dynamization of the distal locking screw. The nail was removed and replaced by a total arthroplasty. Due to the femoral anterior bow of the shaft, anterior cortical impingement of the distal tip of a nail may result in the failure of the nail to slide within the diaphyseal canal when using a medium-length nail preventing compression of the fracture. Dynamic distal locking can be ineffective if the ability of the distal nail to slide within the diaphyseal canal is hindered. This type of scenario can represent an opportunity for anterior nail impingement. Distal jamming of the nail can thus compromise dynamic compression at the fracture site during loading, thus inducing nonunion of the fracture, and leading to breakage of the <b>osteosynthesis</b> <b>device.</b> For these reasons, caution is recommended when using medium-length trochanteric nails for unstable trochanteric fractures.|$|R
40|$|Serious Enterococcus faecalis infections usually require {{combination}} therapy {{to achieve a}} bactericidal effect. In orthopedic infections, the prognosis of enterococcal etiology is considered poor, {{and the use of}} aminoglycosides is questioned. The ampicillin-ceftriaxone combination has recently been accepted as alternative therapy for enterococcal endocarditis. After one of our patients with endocarditis and vertebral osteomyelitis was cured with ampicillin-ceftriaxone, we started a pilot study of orthopedic infections. Patients with infections due to E. faecalis (with two or more surgical samples or blood cultures) diagnosed during 2005 to 2008 were recruited. Polymicrobial infections with ampicillin- and ceftriaxone-resistant microorganisms were excluded. Patients received ampicillin (8 to 16 g/day) -ceftriaxone (2 to 4 g/day) and were followed up prospectively. Of 31 patients with E. faecalis infections, 10 received ampicillin-ceftriaxone. Including the first patient, 11 patients were treated with ampicillin-ceftriaxone: 3 with prosthetic joint infections, 3 with instrumented spine arthrodesis device infections, 2 with <b>osteosynthesis</b> <b>device</b> infections, 1 with foot osteomyelitis, and 2 with vertebral osteomyelitis and endocarditis. Six infections (55 %) were polymicrobial. All cases except the vertebral osteomyelitis ones required surgery, with retention of foreign material in six cases. Ampicillin-ceftriaxone was given for 25 days (interquartile range, 15 to 34 days), followed by amoxicillin (amoxicilline) being given to seven patients (64 %). One patient with endocarditis died within 2 weeks (hemorrhagic stroke) and was not evaluable. For one patient with prosthesis retention, the infection persisted; 9 / 10 patients (90 %) were cured, but 1 patient was superinfected. Follow-up was for 21 months (interquartile range, 14 to 36 months). Ampicillin-ceftriaxone may be a reasonable synergistic combination to treat orthopedic infections due to E. faecalis. Our experience, though limited, shows good outcomes and tolerability and may provide a basis for further well-designed comparative studies...|$|R

Consecutive patients from whom Staphylococcus organisms susceptible to the study drugs were isolated from their orthopedic implants and who had no contraindication to the treatment were eligible for the study. All patients were treated orally with rifampin, 900 mg/day, plus ofloxacin, 600 mg/day. Patients with hip prosthesis infection were treated for 6 months, with removal of any unstable prostheses after 5 months of treatment; patients with knee prosthesis infection were treated for 9 months, with removal of the prosthesis after 6 months of treatment; and patients with infected bone plates were treated for 6 months, with removal of the plate after 3 months of treatment, if necessary. Monthly clinical evaluations were conducted until the completion of the treatment and follow-up or telephone interviews were conducted at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months thereafter. Treatment failures were documented by clinical evaluation, sampling of the infected site for culture and antibiotic activity measurement, and fistulography, if possible. Cure was defined as the absence of clinical, biological, and radiological evidence of infection 6 months after the completion of treatment, treatment failure was defined as the absence of cure, and relapse was defined as the reappearance of infection caused by the same Staphylococcus isolate that caused the original infection, regardless of the timing of this secondary infection. Among 51 patients included in the study and evaluable for safety, 4 patients had side effects and were not evaluable for treatment effectiveness; the overall success rate was 74 % among 47 patients, with a success rate of 81 % for the hip prosthesis group, 69 % for the knee prosthesis group, and 69 % for the <b>osteosynthesis</b> <b>device</b> group.
