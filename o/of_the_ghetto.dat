5|$|When Nazi Germany invaded Lithuania, Gens {{headed the}} Jewish {{hospital}} in Vilnius before the formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> in September 1941. He was appointed chief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> police force and in July 1942 the Germans appointed him head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> Jewish government. He attempted to secure better {{conditions in the}} ghetto and {{believed that it was}} possible to save some Jews by working for the Germans. Gens and his policemen helped Germans in rounding up the Jews for deportation and execution in Ponary in October–December 1941 and in liquidating several smaller ghettos from late 1942 to early 1943. His policies, including the attempt to save some Jews by surrendering others for deportation or execution, continue to be a subject of debate and controversy.|$|E
5|$|While Gens was {{in control}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto,</b> he {{continued}} to oversee the sanitary and health efforts in the ghetto, running that part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> administration like a military operation. Although conditions were very crowded and often unsanitary, the ghetto never suffered a major epidemic and there were fewer deaths due to disease than in other ghettos. A network of children's homes {{was set up in}} March 1942 on Gens' orders. These homes were for orphans or those with parents who could not care properly for them. A department <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> administration was in charge of supervising bosses who employed {{children under the age of}} 16.|$|E
5|$|Gens' {{mother and}} brother, Solomon, were both imprisoned in the Vilnius Ghetto. Another brother, Ephraim, was head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> {{police in the}} Šiauliai Ghetto, and was the only Gens brother to survive the Holocaust.|$|E
50|$|He {{was also}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most active members of Żydowska Samopomoc Społeczna (Polish for Jewish Social Aid), an {{organisation}} established to help <b>the</b> starving people <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Warsaw <b>Ghetto.</b> On <b>the</b> eve <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto's</b> destruction in <b>the</b> spring <b>of</b> 1943, when all seemed lost, the archive was placed in three milk cans and metal boxes. Parts were buried in <b>the</b> cellars <b>of</b> Warsaw buildings.|$|R
25|$|In 2004, Będzin City Council {{decided to}} {{dedicate}} the city square to <b>the</b> heroes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jewish <b>ghetto</b> uprising in Będzin. In August 2005 new memorial was unveiled at <b>the</b> site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Będzin <b>Ghetto.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In Poland's {{cities and}} larger towns, the Nazi {{occupiers}} created ghettos {{that were designed}} to imprison the local Jewish populations. The food rations allocated by the Germans to <b>the</b> <b>ghettos</b> condemned their inhabitants to starvation. Smuggling <b>of</b> food into <b>the</b> <b>ghettos</b> and smuggling <b>of</b> goods out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghettos,</b> organized by Jews and Poles, was <b>the</b> only means <b>of</b> subsistence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jewish population in <b>the</b> <b>ghettos.</b> <b>The</b> price difference between the Aryan [...] and Jewish sides was large, reaching as much as 100%, but the penalty for aiding Jews was death. Hundreds of Polish and Jewish smugglers {{would come in and}} out <b>the</b> <b>ghettos,</b> usually at night or at dawn, through openings in the walls, underground tunnels and sewers or through the guardposts by paying bribes.|$|R
5|$|On 3 September 1943, in {{addition}} to his duties at Płaszów, Göth was the officer in charge of the liquidation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> at Tarnów, which had been home to 25,000 Jews (about 45 per cent of the city's population) at the start of World War II. By the time the ghetto was liquidated, 8,000 Jews remained. They were loaded on a train to Auschwitz concentration camp, but less than half survived the journey. Most of the survivors were deemed unsuitable for forced labour and were murdered immediately on their arrival at Auschwitz. According to testimony of several witnesses as recorded in his 1946 indictment for war crimes, Göth personally shot between 30 and 90 women and children during the liquidation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto.</b>|$|E
5|$|One such {{incident}} occurred in 2004 when a stray bullet {{shot by a}} member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ghetto</b> Boys hit the narrow metal wire in Helen Kelly's bra and was deflected away from her heart. In 2008, a robbery victim was saved from being stabbed in the chest when the attacker's knife was caught and deflected by the underwire of her bra.|$|E
5|$|In September 1941, Gens {{was named}} the {{commander}} of the Jewish policemen for the Vilnius Ghetto by the head of the new Judenrat, Anatol Friend. Officially, the duties of Gens and his policemen were to carry out German and Judenrat orders and provide law enforcement for the inhabitants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto.</b> Included in their first duty, and considered by the occupiers as the single most important task, was the uncovering of any anti-German activity in the ghetto.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} diaries from {{survivors}} {{and hundreds of}} written correspondences made to relations from those in <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> at <b>the</b> time. Photos <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto's</b> deportees to Auschwitz were preserved. A collection of over 2,000 photographs was discovered in October, 1986, including many images of life in Będzin and <b>the</b> <b>ghetto.</b> Some <b>of</b> them {{have been published in}} a book or in a video. The Eyes from the Ashes Foundation administers the collection.|$|R
25|$|A diary kept by Eliezer Yerushalmi, {{a teacher}} and a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto's</b> Judenrat, was {{published}} in Hebrew in 1950 by Yad Vashem. A portion of this diary {{was included in the}} Black Book. Based on the May 1942 census, lists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> names <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kaukazas and Ežero-Trakų ghetto prisoners, as well as Jews who stayed outside <b>the</b> <b>ghetto,</b> were published by the Vilna Gaon Jewish State Museum in 2002.|$|R

5|$|As in Iaşi, Goldfaden {{arrived in}} Bucharest with his {{reputation}} already established. He and his players performed {{first in the}} early spring at the salon Lazăr Cafegiu on Calea Văcăreşti (Văcăreşti Avenue, in the heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto),</b> then, once the weather turned warm, at the Jigniţa garden, a pleasant tree-shaded beer garden on Str. Negru Vodă that up until then had drawn only a neighborhood crowd. He filled out his cast from the great pool of Jewish vocal talent: synagogue cantors. He also recruited two eminently respectable classically trained prima donnas, the sisters Margaretta and Annetta Schwartz.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the end of}} the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (May 1943) and {{beginning}} of 1944, there were between 10,000 and 20,000 Jews hiding in the Ghetto ruins. The number of Robinsons after the Warsaw Uprising has been estimated at between several hundred and two thousand, spread across all the suburbs of Warsaw. Another source gives the number as between 400 and 1,000. Most of those hiding were Jewish, including some who had been in hiding since the fall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> uprising, though a significant number were non-Jewish Poles. Unlike Szpilman, whose case was somewhat unrepresentative, most of those in hiding remained in medium-sized to large groups, often of mixed ethnicities. The majority of the Robinsons were men.|$|E
5|$|In May 1942, Gens secured German {{permission}} for residents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> to sell belongings or property they left with gentiles outside the ghetto. The proceeds {{were to be}} split half and half between the Jewish owners and the Germans. In practice, the Germans often kept {{more than half the}} value, but it still allowed ghetto residents to receive some value for property they no longer controlled. Then in October 1942, the Germans allowed the Jewish ghetto police to retrieve Jewish property left with others outside the ghetto and bring it back to the ghetto. In the same month Gens set up a program to collect, repair, and redistribute winter clothing. The clothes were donated by ghetto residents, repaired in workshops in the ghetto, and then given to the poor and needy. The effort was credited with helping many of the poorest residents survive the winter of 1942–1943.|$|E
50|$|Between January and April 1943 he {{took part}} in actions of {{collecting}} weapons for ŻOB. He was also engaged in production <b>of</b> weapons in <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> (hand grenades, bottles with petrol). On <b>the</b> eve <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Warsaw <b>Ghetto</b> Uprising, in April 1943 he was appointed a commander of his group formed of Bnei Akiva members. The group fought in <b>the</b> so-called central <b>ghetto</b> area.|$|R
50|$|Ever since <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> was established, {{numerous}} deportation {{actions were}} {{organized by the}} Germans with <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Judenrat and Merin, selecting healthy men for slave labor at the camps. Large transfers of Jews took part in May (1,500) and June 1942 (2,000). Around October 1942 - January 1943 <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> {{was moved to the}} Środula district. Środula also bordered <b>the</b> site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Będzin <b>Ghetto.</b> At this point about 13,000 Jews still lived in Sosnowiec. <b>The</b> creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sosnowiec <b>ghetto</b> ended on 10 March 1943, when it was finally closed off from the outside world.|$|R
50|$|Approximately 16,000 Jews {{lived in}} <b>the</b> <b>ghetto.</b> In October, <b>the</b> Nazi administrators {{declared}} that the poor conditions in <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> created a health hazard for local inhabitants and that an epidemic had started in the ghetto; in fact, this declaration was a pretext to move and massacre the Jews. Less than three months later, on 8 October 1941, the Nazis started a massacre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vitebsk Jews, which ended on 11 October with <b>the</b> deaths <b>of</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto's</b> inhabitants (sources vary as to the exact number). Many bodies were disposed in the nearby Vitba river.|$|R
5|$|In {{the city}} of Trieste, then subject to Austrian rule, the Jewish {{community}} saw positive change under Maria Theresa's rule. On 19 April 1771, Maria Theresa granted two Sovereign Licenses to the Jews of Trieste, licenses that constitute real regulations. In 1782, with the famous Edict of Tolerance, her son Joseph II admitted the Jews to some charges in the Stock Exchange and to other liberal professions. A year later the Jewish primary school was opened {{with the name of}} Scuole Pie Normali Israelitiche. The following year, in 1784, the gates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ghetto</b> were opened so that the Jews of Trieste could live together with their fellow citizens of different religions; however most of them continued to live in the Ghetto. Maria Theresa's influence and personal prejudices were limited by the 1780s, and the Jews of Trieste lived in relative peace until the beginning of French rule in the region.|$|E
5|$|In late 1942, the Germans {{consolidated}} {{some small}} ghettos in the Vilnius region with Gens' help. These included the ghettos at Oszmiana, Švenčionys, Soly, and Michaliszki. During {{one of these}} consolidations, on 25 October, Gens gave up 400 old people in return for saving the remaining 600 Jewish residents of Oszmiana. He bribed Martin Weiss, commander of the Ponary killing squad, to accept the lower quota. The Jewish police from Vilnius {{as well as some}} Lithuanians were forced to kill the 400 Jews. One ghetto diarist claimed that the Vilnius ghetto was outraged by Gens' participation in the killings, but other diarists stated that most ghetto inhabitants approved of Gens' choice to save some. By April 1943, most of these small ghettos were gone, with their inhabitants either moved to labor camps, shot, or moved to the Vilnius Ghetto. On 4–5 April, the last inhabitants were loaded into trains {{under the supervision of the}} Vilnius Jewish police, and the police accompanied the trains, which passed through Vilnius on their way to Ponary. Gens joined his policemen when the train went through Vilnius, and was arrested along with them when the train arrived at Ponary. Gens and the policemen were released, but the other Jews on the train were executed. It appears that the Germans misled Gens about the destination of the trains. Gens justified the participation of the Vilnius ghetto police in these roundups by claiming that their participation saved at least some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> residents, when otherwise the Germans would have shot them all.|$|E
5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film {{can be seen as}} having another loose aspect to labor issues. The film directly followed first Thanhouser film to address the subject: The Girl Strike Leader. The film loosely refers labor relations when Jack Hunt is killed in a riot while on strike duty and the young widow is struggles to make ends meet. Thanhouser subjects would deal with other pressing social issues in The Girls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ghetto,</b> another July 1910 release. The plot of The Lucky Shot employed the deus ex machina technique to resolve the financial needs of the widow and her child. Another plot of a needy family suddenly finding a concealed fortune within their house would be reused in The Thunderbolt. The film director and the cameraman are unknown and the only credits known for the cast is that of Marie Eline as the little boy and Mrs. George W. Walters {{in the role of the}} miserly woman. Other members cast may have included the other leading players of the Thanhouser productions, Anna Rosemond, Frank H. Crane and Violet Heming.|$|E

25|$|While many Jews {{reacted to}} their fate with disbelief and passivity, revolts did take place, {{including}} at the Treblinka and Sobibór camps {{and at a}} number <b>of</b> <b>ghettos.</b> <b>The</b> leftist ŻOB was established in <b>the</b> Warsaw <b>Ghetto</b> in July 1942 and was soon commanded by Mordechai Anielewicz.
