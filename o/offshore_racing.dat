25|$|In {{the pilot}} episode, {{and for the}} first season, Crockett pilots a Chris Craft Stinger 390 X - a 39-foot deep-v <b>offshore</b> <b>racing</b> boat. According to T. Rafael Cimino, marine {{director}} for Miami Vice, a total of five Stinger 390 Xs were used on the show. A white 390 X was selected for the pilot episode as it would show up better for the night scenes. For the other four Stingers, Chris-Craft showed the production crew a colour scheme that included the red - however, since Michael Mann decided that the colour red was to never show up on the show so a blue colour scheme was instead chosen. The Stingers used on the show were not free from Chris-Craft. In fact, the boats had some serious warranty issues. These issues caused the production team to switch to using Wellcraft 38 Scarab KVs {{for the remainder of the}} show. The Scarab 38 KVs were a 28-hued, twin 440-hp boat that sold for $130,000 in 1986.|$|E
