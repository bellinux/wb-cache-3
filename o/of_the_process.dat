5|$|Markov {{processes}} are stochastic processes, traditionally in discrete or continuous time, {{that have the}} Markov property, which means the next value of the Markov process depends on the current value, but it is conditionally independent of the previous values of the stochastic process. In other words, the behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> {{in the future is}} stochastically independent of its behavior in the past, given the current state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E

The process is used primarily to weld iron and steels (including stainless steel) but aluminium, nickel and copper alloys can also be welded with this method.|$|E

5|$|Blast {{furnaces}} {{existed in}} China from about 1st century AD {{and in the}} West from the High Middle Ages. They spread from the region around Namur in Wallonia (Belgium) in the late 15th century, being introduced to England in 1491. The fuel used in these was invariably charcoal. The successful substitution of coke for charcoal is widely attributed to Abraham Darby in 1709. The efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> was further enhanced by the practice of preheating the combustion air (hot blast), patented by James Beaumont Neilson in 1828.|$|E

The operation peaked between mid-1943 and mid-1944, with approximately 65,000 notes a month produced from six flat-bed printing presses.|$|E

5|$|GTAW {{can be used}} {{on nearly}} all {{weldable}} metals, though it is most often applied to stainless steel and light metals. It is often used when quality welds are extremely important, such as in bicycle, aircraft and naval applications. A related process, plasma arc welding, also uses a tungsten electrode but uses plasma gas to make the arc. The arc is more concentrated than the GTAW arc, making transverse control more critical and thus generally restricting the technique to a mechanized process. Because of its stable current, the method {{can be used on}} a wider range of material thicknesses than can the GTAW process and it is much faster. It can be applied to all of the same materials as GTAW except magnesium, and automated welding of stainless steel is one important application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>process.</b> A variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> is plasma cutting, an efficient steel cutting process.|$|E
