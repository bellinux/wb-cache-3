5|$|Caglione and Drexler were {{recommended}} for the prosthetic makeup designs by Canonero, {{with whom they}} had worked on The Cotton Club (1984). The rogues gallery makeup designs were directly taken from Gould's drawings, {{with the exception of}} Al Pacino (Big Boy Caprice), who improvised his own designs, ignoring the rather overweight character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strip.</b> His makeup took 3.5 hours to apply.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Rich Moore. Barney's apartment, which Homer spends the night in when he is kicked out by Marge, is partly based on an apartment Jim Reardon, Moore, {{and a few other}} animators of The Simpsons shared in college. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> clubs Homer and Bart visit when they are trying to find Princess Kashmir is based on the Seventh Veil Strip Club in Los Angeles, California. The staff went around Hollywood taking pictures of strip clubs so that they could get inspiration for the interior design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> club buildings in Springfield. The character designer designed over fifty different international showgirl costumes for the showgirls in the burlesque show sequence. Carl Carlson made his first appearance on The Simpsons in this episode.|$|E

40|$|Theoretical {{analysis}} and experiment validation {{were conducted to}} optimize development <b>of</b> improved <b>stripping</b> harvesters. <b>The</b> header loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stripping</b> harvesters was greatly influenced by parameters such as the height and rotational speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stripping</b> rotor, <b>the</b> forward velocity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> machine, and the airflow field, etc. Mathematical models for the optimal design and <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>stripping</b> harvesters were developed. During the operation, <b>the</b> center axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stripping</b> rotor must be at the height below <b>the</b> ears <b>of</b> crops. When <b>the</b> cylinder was running, <b>the</b> linear velocity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stripping</b> teeth should be up to 14 – 17 m/s (<b>the</b> keyhole center <b>of</b> slotted teeth). Also, the airflow velocity at the entrance should be higher than that at the exit {{and should not be}} lower than 5 m/s...|$|R
5|$|There {{has been}} no new {{material}} since 2001, but reprints <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> have appeared online and in print.

In October 2007, Setanta bought the original strips, which they featured on their web site.|$|E
5|$|Especially {{during the}} 1980s, real-life personalities often made appearances. Former Division One stars Bob Wilson and Emlyn Hughes were brought out of {{retirement}} to play for Melchester in 1985, along with longtime fans <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> Martin Kemp and Steve Norman, of the pop group Spandau Ballet. Geoff Boycott served for several years as Melchester's chairman, and Sir Alf Ramsey had briefly taken over as manager of Melchester in 1982, while Roy lay in his coma. Players such as Malcolm Macdonald and Trevor Francis would sometimes line up alongside Roy in England matches, {{despite the fact that}} the clubs they played for in real life were never featured in the strip.|$|E
5|$|Not far to {{the east}} of this junction, NY5 and NY92 meet I-481 by way of a {{cloverleaf}} interchange. East of the interchange, Genesee Street widens to six lanes (three in each direction) as it heads along a commercial strip anchored by a large plaza featuring a Wegmans Food Markets store. NY5 and NY92 split at the east end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> in the hamlet of Lyndon. While NY5 continues east along Genesee Street to Fayetteville, NY92 heads southeast along the two-lane Highbridge Road and bypasses Fayetteville to the southwest.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after {{entering}} Cayuga County, NY31 crosses {{and begins to}} parallel the New York State Thruway (I-90), which NY31 does {{for most of its}} routing west of the outer Syracuse suburbs. In Port Byron, NY31 intersects NY38 {{in the center of the}} village. The routes embark on an overlap through the village before separating near the eastern edge of Port Byron. NY31 continues alone to Weedsport, where the route meets NY34 and County Route31B (CR31B, formerly NY31B) north of the village. East of Weedsport, NY31 and the Thruway are joined by the CSX Rochester Subdivision mainline, which runs down the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> of land created by the Thruway to the north and NY31 to the south.|$|E
5|$|Tangascootack Creek is {{considered}} to be a cold water fishery. The tributary North Fork Tangascootack Creek has significant trout and macroinvertebrate populations. On the main stem of the creek, there are limited numbers of fish and some aquatic ecosystems, though in the middle and upper parts of the creek, there is virtually no life in the water. Near the headwaters and Bear Swamp, there is some aquatic life, as these locations are upstream <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> mines and acid mine drainage. The main species of fish in the creek are brook trout, Semotilus atromaculatus, Catostomus commersoni, and Rhinichthys atratulus. Young-of-the-Year trout also live in the creek.|$|E
5|$|The Aouzou dispute was {{concluded}} for good on 3 February 1994, when the judges of the ICJ {{by a majority}} of 16 to 1 decided that the Aouzou Strip belonged to Chad. The court's judgement was implemented without delay, the two parties signing an agreement as early as 4 April concerning the practical modalities for the implementation of the judgement. Monitored by international observers, the withdrawal of Libyan troops from the Strip began on 15 April and was completed by 10 May. The formal and final transfer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Strip</b> from Libya to Chad took place on 30 May, when the sides signed a joint declaration stating that the Libyan withdrawal had been effected.|$|E

5|$|As soon as {{the lead}} T-34s reached the minefield, they {{came under heavy fire}} from the fort's garrison. Soon all three tanks were either {{destroyed}} or damaged, so the combat engineers proceeded to breach the minefield on their own. Israeli aircraft began strafing and bombing the Egyptian forces for over {{two and a half hours}} while encountering no resistance, leading to the destruction of all six tanks and five vehicles. The Israelis bombed Egyptian forces at the minefield and on an area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> stretching two kilometers towards Port Fouad. Under fire from the air and from the fort, the attack bogged down to a complete halt before the Egyptians began to retreat. Salah ordered his battalion to assume defensive positions east of Port Fouad to repel any Israeli counterattack and to regroup.|$|E
5|$|From Lexington Avenue, where NY390 passes {{into the}} town of Greece, north to NY104, NY390 runs {{parallel}} to {{the western edge of}} Eastman Business Park, the large production and distribution complex owned and maintained by Eastman Kodak. Midway between the Lexington Avenue and West Ridge Road exits, NY390 encounters Ridgeway Avenue via a partial diamond interchange. Just north of Ridgeway Avenue, the expressway crosses a small, narrow strip of land that lies within the Rochester city limits, a carryover from when the Erie Canal occupied this tract and entered the city decades before. North <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strip,</b> NY390 curves to the northeast, passing along {{the west side of the}} industrial park and the eastern edge of a residential yet wooded area to reach NY104. Heading northbound, it splits into two halves, with exit24A connecting to NY104 east and exit24B linking to NY104 west.|$|E
5|$|Serendipity 3 was a 1950s style diner, {{featuring}} burgers, {{fries and}} ice cream delicacies. Portions were extremely large. The ice cream parlor themed restaurant, which was {{a branch of the}} New York City Serendipity 3 establishment, opened in 2009. In addition to seating in the dining area and counter seating, there was a patio with views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Strip</b> and the Caesars Palace fountains. Besides its giant hamburger, the restaurant was known for its Triple Decker Grilled Cheese sandwich and a The Hangover omelet made with bacon, cheese, French fries, and mushrooms. Ice cream sundaes featured a choice of toppings including butterscotch sauce, chocolate sauce, hot fudge, marshmallow sauce, Oreo kisses, peanut butter sauce, rainbow sprinkles, raspberry sauce, etc. Other options included Fried Twinkies, brownies, and the Golden Opulence sundae, an indulgent $1,000 US sundae, which holds the Guinness World Record for the Most Expensive Ice Cream Sundae in the World. It closed on January 2, 2017.|$|E

5|$|West of the village, US20, NY5, and NY414 {{become a}} major {{commercial}} strip as it heads through an area situated between the hamlet of Seneca Falls and the village of Waterloo. Roughly midway between the two communities, NY414 splits from US20 and NY5, becoming a commercial strip itself as it heads north through the northern portion {{of the town of}} Seneca Falls as Mound Road. Near the northern end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strip,</b> the route crosses the main line of the Finger Lakes Railway at a grade crossing. Past the crossing, the businesses give way to mostly undeveloped areas that persist into the neighboring town of Tyre, where it intersects NY318 in the small hamlet of Magee as Ridge Road. Just north of this intersection, NY414 intersects the New York State Thruway (I-90) at exit41. North of the Thruway, NY414 maintains a constant north-northwest alignment across rolling farmland into Wayne County.|$|E
