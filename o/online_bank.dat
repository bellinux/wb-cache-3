This research also intended to propose a set of precaution measures to prevent online phishing attack were proposed based on the victim's point of view in terms of human and technological aspect. Semi structured interviews were conducted with five phishing victim identified through snowball techniques. The results of descriptive qualitative analysis showed that the victims has lost their trust in <b>online</b> <b>banking</b> despite of being reliant to the service prior to the attack. Four of the victims are reluctant to use <b>online</b> <b>banking</b> after the phishing attack. Meanwhile, one victim is still loyal to <b>online</b> <b>banking</b> due to conveniences it provide. The research shows that <b>online</b> <b>banking</b> never directly harmed the victims, but the perpetrator used <b>online</b> <b>banking</b> as the platform to commit malicious attack. Low online trust towards <b>online</b> <b>banking</b> influenced the user's loyalty and interest in <b>online</b> <b>banking.</b> For future improvement, this study should extend the research in developing a reliable anti phishing application to help <b>online</b> <b>banking</b> user in detecting phishing threat.

40|$|<b>Online</b> <b>banking</b> {{systems have}} become more common and widely used in daily life, {{bringing}} huge changes in modern banking transaction activities and giving us a greater opportunity to access the banking system anytime and anywhere. At the same time, however, {{one of the key}} challenges that still remain is to fully resolve the security concerns associated with the <b>online</b> <b>banking</b> system. Many clients feel that <b>online</b> <b>banking</b> is not secure enough, and to increase its security levels, many banks simply add more identity-checking steps or put on more security measures to some extent to give users the impression of a secure <b>online</b> <b>banking</b> system. However, this is easier to be said than done, because we believe that more identity-checking steps could compromise the usability of the <b>online</b> <b>banking</b> system, which is an inevitable feature in design of usable and useful <b>online</b> <b>banking</b> systems. Banks can simply enhance their security level with more sophisticated technologies, but this does not seem to guarantee the <b>online</b> <b>banking</b> system is in line with its key usability concern. Therefore, the research question raised in this thesis is to establish the relationships between usability, security and trustworthiness in the <b>online</b> <b>banking</b> system. To demonstrate these relationships, three experiments were carried out using the simulation of an <b>online</b> <b>banking</b> logon procedure to provide a similar <b>online</b> <b>banking</b> experience. Post questionnaires were used to measure the three concepts, i. e. usability, security and trustworthiness. The resulting analyses revealed that simply adding more identity-checking steps in the <b>online</b> <b>banking</b> system did not improve the customers? perceived security and trustworthiness, nor the biometric security technique (i. e., fingerprints) did enhance the subjective ratings on the perceived security and trustworthiness. This showed that the systems designer needs to be aware that the customer?s perception of the <b>online</b> <b>banking</b> system {{is not the same as}} that conceived from a technical standpoint...|$|R
