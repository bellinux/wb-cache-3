5|$|Studies have {{demonstrated}} that geographically separated R.brevipes populations (globally and continentally) develop significant genetic differentiation, suggesting that gene flow between these populations is small. In contrast, there was little genetic differentiation <b>observed</b> <b>between</b> populations sampled from a smaller area (less than approximately 1000meters).

5|$|Aetosaur {{material}} {{continued to}} be described into the early 20th century, with notable paleontologists such as Barnum Brown and Charles Camp collecting specimens. However, aetosaur remains were still being confused with those of phytosaurs. During this time, aetosaurs were usually considered {{to be members of}} Pseudosuchia, a now obsolete group consisting of various Triassic archosaurs including phytosaurs. However, similarities were often <b>observed</b> <b>between</b> aetosaurs and Crocodilia, the group to which aetosaurs were initially referred in the 19th century. While the skull had many features in common with pseudosuchians, parts of the postcranial skeleton, in particular the scutes, seemed to be similar to those of crocodilians.|$|E
5|$|Flood beds {{in other}} {{locations}} upstream of Lake Lewis such as Ninemile Creek in Montana and the Sanpoil arm of glacial Lake Columbia show a corresponding regularity of flood deposits {{as well as}} deposit grading and rhythmical repetition to those in Lake Lewis. Since Glacial Lake Columbia remained filled, annual deposits (varves) can be <b>observed</b> <b>between</b> flood deposits. The flood deposits can be distinguished from annually deposited varves by both their thickness {{and the presence of}} materials foreign to the immediate drainage. Atwater reports from 35 to 55 annual varves between flood deposits in Lake Columbia, supporting a period of 35 to 55 years between ice dam failures.|$|E

5|$|Matings are {{generally}} <b>observed</b> <b>between</b> March and May, {{but the most}} likely time of conception is April. Most mating {{takes place in the}} territories and during the day. Females have control over the copulation process, and males may have to keep mating with the same females. Females usually give birth to one young each year. Gestation lasts around 27 weeks, and pregnant females give birth between late September and November. Late births into January are sometimes observed. The altricial newborns rely on their mothers for warmth. For their first three weeks, young cling to their mothers when they go foraging. After this, the young remain in the roosts. By January, young are capable of sustained flight, and by February, March or April are fully weaned.|$|E
5|$|Ruffed lemurs, on average, spend 28% {{of the day}} feeding, 53% resting, and 19% traveling, {{although}} {{differences in}} resting and feeding durations have been <b>observed</b> <b>between</b> males and females, with females resting less and feeding more. They are diurnal; although peak activity occurs during the early morning and late afternoon or evening, resting usually occurs around midday. When resting, ruffed lemurs often sit hunched or upright. They are also frequently seen lying prone over a branch or sunbathing in a supine position with the limbs outstretched. When feeding, they will often hang upside-down by their hind feet, a type of suspensory behavior, which allows them to reach fruits and flowers.|$|E

At the time of publishing of WASP-43b's discovery on April 15, 2011, the planet was the most closely orbiting Hot Jupiter discovered. The small orbit of WASP-43b is thought to be caused by WASP-43's unusually low mass. WASP-43 was first <b>observed</b> <b>between</b> January and May 2009 by the SuperWASP project, and was found to be cooler and slightly richer in metals than the Sun.

5|$|Americium readily {{reacts with}} oxygen and dissolves well in acids. The most common {{oxidation}} state for americium is +3, in which americium compounds are rather stable against oxidation and reduction. In this sense, americium is chemically similar to most lanthanides. The trivalent americium forms insoluble fluoride, oxalate, iodate, hydroxide, phosphate and other salts. Other oxidation {{states have been}} <b>observed</b> <b>between</b> +2 and +7, which is the widest range among the actinide elements. Their color in aqueous solutions varies as follows: Am3+ (colorless to yellow-reddish), Am4+ (yellow-reddish), AmV; (yellow), AmVI (brown) and AmVII (dark green). All oxidation states have their characteristic optical absorption spectra, with a few sharp peaks in the visible and mid-infrared regions, and the position and intensity of these peaks can be converted into the concentrations of the corresponding oxidation states. For example, Am(III) has two sharp peaks at 504 and 811nm, Am(V) at 514 and 715nm, and Am(VI) at 666 and 992nm.|$|E
5|$|As a whole, {{the ring}} system of Uranus is unlike either the faint dusty rings of Jupiter or the broad and complex rings of Saturn, {{some of which}} are {{composed}} of very bright material—water ice. However, there are similarities with some parts of the latter ring system; the Saturnian F ring and the Uranian ε ring are both narrow, relatively dark and are shepherded by a pair of moons. The newly discovered outer ν and μ rings of Uranus are similar to the outer G and E rings of Saturn. Narrow ringlets existing in the broad Saturnian rings also resemble the narrow rings of Uranus. In addition, dust bands <b>observed</b> <b>between</b> the main rings of Uranus may be similar to the rings of Jupiter. In contrast, the Neptunian ring system is quite similar to that of Uranus, although it is less complex, darker and contains more dust; the Neptunian rings are also positioned further from the planet.|$|E

5|$|For males, {{selection}} of the best breeders is more complex. The first step is weaning, when the morphology of calves and the known qualities of their parents are used to make an initial {{selection of}} animals that receive the qualification Reproductive Hope (in French Reproducteur Espoir, abbreviated to Espoir). Annually in excess of about 700 bull calves are then selected to enter the national evaluation station at , close {{to the city of}} Limoges in central France, just after weaning, when they are about seven months old. At Lanaud the animals are grouped together to compare their performance under identical feeding and environmental conditions to the age of 13–14 months. The differences <b>observed</b> <b>between</b> the animals are then related principally to their genetics, which is of interest to breeders because this is what is transmitted to a bull's progeny.|$|E
5|$|The species breeds in North America and {{winters in}} the Caribbean. Some studies have {{observed}} {{significant differences in}} terms of migratory behavior and plumage color between northern and southern populations within the breeding range. The northern population mainly winters in the western Caribbean (Cuba and Jamaica) while the southern population usually spends the winter on eastern islands (Hispaniola and Puerto Rico). Moreover, males in the southern population have darker plumage {{than those in the}} northern population. These differences have led biologists to consider them as separate subspecies. However, a recent study in the United States reveals no significant genetic differentiation between northern (samples from Michigan, New Hampshire and New York states) and southern populations (sample from North Carolina). The study results actually show a recent population expansion from a single glacial refugium, therefore the current populations are homogeneous in terms of genetics. The differentiation that is <b>observed</b> <b>between</b> the northern and southern populations should have occurred quite recently.|$|E
5|$|Zebra {{sharks are}} usually solitary, though aggregations of 2050 {{individuals}} have been recorded.

There is an observation of an adult male zebra shark biting the pectoral fin of another adult male and pushing him against the sea floor; the second male was turned on his back, and remained motionless for several minutes. This behavior resembles pre-copulatory behaviors {{between male and female}} sharks, and in both cases the biting and holding of the pectoral fin has been speculated to relate to one shark asserting dominance over the other.|$|E
