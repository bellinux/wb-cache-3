5|$|After the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries had {{abandoned}} the coalition and increasingly viewed the Bolsheviks as traitors to the revolution. In July 1918, the Left Socialist Revolutionary Yakov Grigorevich Blumkin assassinated the German ambassador to Russia, Wilhelm von Mirbach, hoping that the ensuing diplomatic incident {{would lead to a}} relaunched revolutionary war against Germany. The Left Socialist Revolutionaries then launched a coup in Moscow, shelling the Kremlin and seizing the city's central post <b>office</b> <b>before</b> being stopped by Trotsky's forces. The party's leaders and many members were arrested and imprisoned, but were treated more leniently than other opponents of the Bolsheviks.|$|E

Vidya and Rana break into the NDC office and find Damji's file, barely escaping an encounter with Bob, who is searching for the same information. Meanwhile, the attempts to obtain Damji's records have {{attracted the attention of}} two Intelligence Bureau (IB) officials in Delhi—the chief Bhaskaran K.

In spite of Khan's warnings, Vidya continues her search, fearing that Arnab's resemblance to Damji may have led him into trouble.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Harrison (August 20, 1833– March 13, 1901) was an American {{politician}} and lawyer {{who served as}} the 23rd President of the United States from 1889 to 1893; he was the grandson of the ninth president, William Henry Harrison, creating the only grandfather-grandson duo to hold the <b>office.</b> <b>Before</b> ascending to the presidency, Harrison established himself as a prominent local attorney, Presbyterian church leader, and politician in Indianapolis, Indiana. During the American Civil War, he served in the Union Army as a colonel, and was confirmed by the U.S. Senate as a brevet brigadier general of volunteers in 1865. Harrison unsuccessfully ran for governor of Indiana in 1876. The Indiana General Assembly elected Harrison to a six-year term in the U.S. Senate, where he served from 1881 to 1887.|$|E

By a margin of only 77 votes, Chamberlain narrowly defeated Labour candidate Oswald Mosley (who later led the British Union of Fascists). Believing he would lose if he stood again in Ladywood, Chamberlain arranged to be adopted for Birmingham Edgbaston, the district of the city {{where he was born}} and which was a much safer seat which he would hold {{for the rest of his}} life. The Unionists won the election, but Chamberlain declined to serve again as Chancellor, preferring his former position as Minister of Health.|$|E
5|$|Enrollment {{continued}} to rise, {{and by the}} end of his tenure, Ross requested that parents first communicate with his <b>office</b> <b>before</b> sending their sons to the school. The increase in students necessitated an improvement in facilities, and from late 1891 until September 1898, the college spent over $97,000 on improvements and new buildings. This included construction of a mess hall, which could seat 500 diners at once, an infirmary, which included the first indoor toilets on campus, an artesian well, a natatorium, four faculty residences, an electric light plant, an ice works, a laundry, a cold storage room, a slaughterhouse, a gymnasium, a warehouse, and an artillery shed. Despite the expenditures on facilities, the school treasury held a surplus in 1893 and 1894. The 1894 financial report credited the surplus to Ross's leadership, and Ross ensured the money was returned to the students in the form of lower fees.|$|E

Richard, who was Duke of Aquitaine at the time, named Longchamp chancellor of the Duchy of Aquitaine. Longchamp first distinguished himself at the court of King Philip II of France in Paris in 1189, when he acted as Richard's envoy in a dispute with William Marshall, King Henry's envoy. By that time, Longchamp was already one of Richard's trusted advisors.|$|E
5|$|Senators {{are elected}} in even-numbered {{years when the}} President of the United States is not being elected, similar to most other state offices in Maryland. The most recent {{election}} was in November 2014. Senators are not term-limited. Should a Senator resign from <b>office</b> <b>before</b> his or her term expires, the local central committee of the party to which the retiring senator belonged makes a recommendation to the Governor for whom to appoint to the open seat. It is tradition for the Governor to appoint the recommended person. Four of the current members of the Maryland State Senate were originally appointed, two of whom have since been elected in their own right. Newly elected Senators are sworn in and begin work on the second Wednesday of the January following their election.|$|E
5|$|The Seventeenth Amendment {{altered the}} process for electing United States Senators and changed the way {{vacancies}} would be filled.

5|$|With {{the union}} {{threatening}} strike action, particularly at international matches, in April 1909 the Football Association insisted that all players agree {{to leave the}} union and pledge loyalty to the FA. Manchester United refused to issue the revised contracts to its players, and FA suspended the entire squad. The club then refused to pay the players in lieu of their suspension, and so the players instead took away ornaments from the club's <b>office</b> <b>before</b> Mangnall persuaded them to return the items. The players continued to train, and captain Charlie Roberts {{came up with the}} name of Outcasts F.C. The FA organised a meeting of 200 players, excluding the Outcasts, but a rambling speech from chairman Charles Clegg failed to win them over, and an agreement was reached where the PU would be recognised by the FA.|$|E
5|$|Spirited Away was {{released}} theatrically in Japan on 20 July 2001 by distributor Toho, grossing ¥30.4 billion {{to become the}} highest-grossing film in Japanese history, according to the Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan. It {{was also the first}} film to earn $200 million at the worldwide box <b>office</b> <b>before</b> opening in the United States. The film was dubbed into English by Walt Disney Pictures, under the supervision of Pixar's John Lasseter. The dubbed version premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on 7 September 2002 and was later released in North America on 20 September 2002. Spirited Away had very little marketing, less than Disney's other B-films, with at most, 151 theaters showing the film in 2002. After the 2003 Oscars, it expanded to as many as 714 theaters. The film grossed US$4 million in its opening weekend and ultimately grossed around $10 million by September 2003. In addition to its North American earnings of $10 million and Japanese earnings of $250 million, it grossed a further $29 million from other countries for a worldwide total of about $289 million. In Argentina, it's in the Top 10 of anime films with the most tickets sold.|$|E
5|$|Tensions between Japan and China {{heightened}} {{after the}} former launched its punitive expedition against Taiwan in May 1874 in retaliation {{of the murder}} of a number of shipwrecked sailors by the Paiwan aborigines. China inquired into the possibility of buying ironclad warships from Great Britain and Japan was already negotiating with the Brazilian government about the purchase of the ironclad Independencia then under construction in Britain. The Japanese terminated the negotiations with the Brazilians in October after the ship was badly damaged upon launching and the expeditionary force was about to withdraw from Taiwan. The crisis illustrated the need to reinforce the IJN and a budget request was submitted that same month by Acting Navy Minister Kawamura Sumiyoshi for ¥3.9–4.2 million to purchase three warships from abroad. No Japanese shipyard was able to build ships of this size so they were ordered from Great Britain. This was rejected as too expensive and a revised request of ¥2.3 million was approved later that month. Nothing was done until March 1875 when Kawamura proposed to buy one ironclad for half of the money authorized and use the rest for shipbuilding and gun production at the Yokosuka Shipyard. No response was made by the Prime Minister's <b>office</b> <b>before</b> the proposal was revised to use all of the allocated money to buy three ships, one armored frigate and two armored corvettes of composite construction to be designed by the prominent British naval architect Sir Edward Reed, formerly the Chief Constructor of the Royal Navy. Reed would also supervise the construction of the ships for an honorarium of five percent of the construction cost. The Prime Minister's office approved the revised proposal on 2 May and notified the Japanese consul, Ueno Kagenori, that navy officers would be visiting to negotiate the contract with Reed.|$|E
