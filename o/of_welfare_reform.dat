Although McNutt's administration curtailed the use of court injunctions to prevent labor picketing, McNutt did not hesitate to declare martial law in eleven coal-mining counties where major violence accompanied union efforts to organize the miners. In all, McNutt called out the Indiana National Guard three times in response to labor-related violence.|$|E

500|$|Enactment <b>of</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>reform</b> was a {{major goal}} of Bill Clinton's presidency, but when the first two bills on the issue came from a Republican-controlled Congress that lacked protections for people coming off welfare, Hillary urged him to veto the bills, which he did. A third version came up during his 1996 general {{election}} campaign that restored some of the protections but cut the scope of benefits in other areas; critics, including her past mentor Edelman, urged her to get the president to veto it again. But she decided to support the bill, which became the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, as the best political compromise available. This caused a rift with Edelman that Hillary later called [...] "sad and painful".|$|E

2500|$|The mid-1990s was {{a period}} <b>of</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>reform.</b> Prior to 1996, the rules for the cash welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), were waived for many states.

2500|$|The {{next phase}} <b>of</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>reform</b> {{announced}} by Duncan Smith in late 2011 required benefits claimants with part-time incomes below a certain threshold {{to search for}} additional work or risk losing access to their benefits.

[...] "Now we are looking to change the rules for those who are in-work and claiming benefits, so that once they have overcome their barriers and got into work, in time they can reduce their dependency or come off benefits altogether." [...] He said that benefits were not a route out of child poverty but hundreds of thousands of children could be lifted out of child poverty if one of their parents were to work at least a 35-hour week at the national minimum wage.|$|E

2500|$|He also {{announced}} {{a far more}} radical series of reforms intended to simplify the benefits and tax credits scheme into a single payment {{to be known as}} Universal Credit.

[...] "After years of piecemeal reform the current welfare system is complex and unfair," [...] said Duncan Smith, citing examples of people under the existing system that would see very little incremental income from increasing their working hours due to withdrawal of other benefits. Outlining the scheme in more detail in November 2010, Duncan Smith promised [...] "targeted work activity for those who need {{to get used to the}} habits of work" [...] and sanctions, including the possible removal of benefits for up to three years for those who refused to work. He said welfare reform would benefit all those who [...] "play by the rules" [...] and ensure [...] "work always pays more" [...] by easing the rate at which benefits are withdrawn as income rises.|$|E

The effects of these policies are analyzed using a newly estimated model of state labor markets.

Displacement effects of labor supply policies are highest when a state's unemployment is high, whereas displacement effects of labor demand policies are highest when a state's unemployment is low.
