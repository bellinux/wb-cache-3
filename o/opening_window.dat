500|$|Light and {{darkness}} feature prominently in Psycho. The first shot after the intertitle is the sunny landscape of Phoenix before the camera enters a dark hotel room where Sam and Marion appear as bright figures. Marion is almost immediately cast in darkness; she is preceded by her shadow as she reenters {{the office to}} steal money and as she enters her bedroom. When she flees Phoenix, darkness descends on her drive. The following sunny morning is punctured by a watchful police officer with black sunglasses, and she finally arrives at the Bates Motel in near darkness. Bright lights are also [...] "the ironic equivalent of darkness" [...] in the film, blinding instead of illuminating. Examples of brightness include the <b>opening</b> <b>window</b> shades in Sam's and Marion's hotel room, vehicle headlights at night, the neon sign at the Bates Motel, [...] "the glaring white" [...] of the bathroom tiles where Marion dies, and the fruit cellar's exposed light bulb shining on the corpse of Norman's mother. Such bright lights typically characterize danger and violence in Hitchcock's films.|$|E

It has a well constructed vaulted basement 6 metres in length and has two storeys topped by a slated conical roof. A pair of opposed doorways once existed, set at ground level and there are two small windows on the first floor with a larger more recent south <b>opening</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E

Wandering over fields, forests and villages, at first in the vicinity of Wołomin, and later of Zambrów, I found myself, in late November, in the area of Hodyszewo (near Łomża). Throughout my wandering, the peasants for the most part were amenable to put me up for the night and to feed me—some either suspecting my origins or pressing me to admit it." ...|$|E

The Media Centre, which was built by Pendennis Shipyard from the UK in combination with Centraalstaal from The Netherlands, was commissioned {{in time for the}} 1999 Cricket World Cup and was the first all aluminium, semi-monocoque building in the world. It was built and fitted-out in two boatyards and utilises boat-building technology. It has only one <b>opening</b> <b>window,</b> which is in the broadcasting box occupied by BBC Test Match Special. [...] The fact that the structure was built by a shipyard is betrayed by the internal doors having rounded corners similar to those in many ships. Such a door is visible in the background of the photo of the Media Centre interior.|$|E

30|$|For instance, {{on a cool}} sunny day, {{the smart}} home {{automation}} system might find it optimal to conserve energy by <b>opening</b> <b>windows,</b> turning air conditioners off, and turning lights off. What is uncertain is whether such a strategy would always ensure {{the comfort of the}} user. Particularly, <b>opening</b> <b>windows</b> to achieve favourable indoor temperature when the outdoor air is heavily polluted can cause a lot of discomfort to the user. Also, when the environment is noisy, and this strategy is employed whilst the inhabitants are studying would be undesirable. Clearly, uncertainty would always exist in nature, and how best we manage that determines the effectiveness of these technological systems.|$|R

5000|$|The two {{bedrooms}} were {{approximately the same}} fairly generous size with picture windows which included an <b>opening</b> <b>window.</b> The kitchen was fitted with steel cupboards, drawers and an integral sink unit. A side door entered directly into the kitchen. A gas (copper) boiler, gas oven and hob, and a fitted-in gas fridge were incorporated into the inbuilt steel kitchen units. A drop-down wall-fitted table adjacent to a built-in larder was opposite the built-in units. The lounge had an open coal fire, the heat from which heated a back boiler, thus giving [...] "free" [...] hot water. The bathroom had a full-size bath and fitted steel cupboards. There was a separate toilet. The lounge and both bedrooms had steel built-in cupboards and drawers. Arcons were so well fitted (in Debden, Loughton, Essex) that the only furniture necessary were beds, kitchen chairs, lounge seating and floor coverings. Chain-link fencing, a gate and a coal shed built with corrugated steel from Anderson shelters and brick front and rear walls was also provided. Gardens were of sufficient size to grow vegetables, and many early residents quickly erected a chicken run.|$|E
