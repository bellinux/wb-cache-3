Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine commented that the video was [...] "sexy" [...] and that [...] "Beyoncé pops it back for a mysterious detective." [...] Lewis Corner of Digital Spy wrote that Beyoncé dances [...] "seductively" [...] in the office. Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine wrote: [...] "To anyone who finds Beyoncé attractive or has ever wanted her to dance for them, we bring you her latest video. The visuals for 'Dance for You' {{are more or less}} a chance for her to show off why so many <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> her husband, Jay-Z, is the luckiest man alive." [...] Leah Collins of Canadian magazine Dose wrote, [...] "It's all very sultry and intimate to a point—that point being the moment she unveils a line-up of back-up dancers." [...] Similarly, a writer of the website Idolator commented, [...] "'Dance for You' doesn't compare to the spectacle of say, the 'Run the World (Girls)' clip, but it is effective. [...] It's a mostly private dance—until all those other ladies show up." [...] The writer also called Beyoncé a femme fatale in the video. Likewise, Sarah Anne Hughes of The Washington Post wrote that Beyoncé [...] "goes full on femme fatale" [...] and concluded that the concept of the video [...] "is about as straightforward as can be". Marc Hogan of Spin magazine noted, [...] "The video follows pretty literally from the song's theme, with Mrs. Jay-Z grinding sensuously." [...] A writer of Vibe magazine noted that Beyoncé was [...] "keeping things sexy" [...] with the video for the song.|$|E
