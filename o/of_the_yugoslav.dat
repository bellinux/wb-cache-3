5|$|A {{resistance}} movement soon emerged. On 22 June 1941, the 1st Sisak Partisan Detachment was formed near Sisak, {{as the first}} military unit formed by a {{resistance movement}} in occupied Europe. This sparked the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> Partisan movement, a communist multi-ethnic anti-fascist resistance group led by Josip Broz Tito. The movement grew rapidly and at the Tehran Conference in December 1943 the Partisans gained recognition from the Allies.|$|E
5|$|An Unforgettable Summer was {{especially}} {{noted for its}} depiction of oppression, nationalism and xenophobia, and for its investigation of violence in both interwar Romania and the Balkans. It is also connected {{with the end of}} Communist Yugoslavia and the onset <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> wars: Lucian Pintilie once stated that he had been inspired by this outcome when filming on location, and continued to refer to it in later interviews.|$|E
5|$|Completed in {{the context}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> wars, the film {{constitutes}} {{an investigation into the}} consequences of xenophobia and state-sanctioned repression, as well as an indictment of a failure in reaching out. It is thus often described as a verdict on the history of Romania, as well as on problems facing the Balkans at large, and occasionally described as a warning that violence could also erupt in a purely Romanian context.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, while {{hiding from}} Nazi German {{forces in the}} forests of Yugoslavia, Serbian Chetniks made the {{so-called}} Chetniks Gibanica from ingredients that they had received from peasants. When the commander <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> Partisans, Josip Broz Tito, and Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović met at Ravna Gora in 1941, Gibanica and potato under sač with kaymak were served specifically for them.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 7 April, three Blenheims <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> 8th Bomber Regiment took off from Rovine to bomb the railway {{junction}} at Feldbach, but became disoriented in bad weather. Only one aircraft found a target in Austria, bombing a bridge and road near Steyr before continuing on to Wiener Neustadt where it was hit by anti-aircraft fire and made an emergency landing.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Cavalry Division was a horsed cavalry {{formation}} of the Royal Yugoslav Army that formed part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> 1st Army Group during the German-led Axis invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in April 1941. In peacetime, the division consisted of two cavalry brigades commanding {{a total of four}} cavalry regiments, but its wartime organisation specified one cavalry brigade commanding two or three cavalry regiments, along with divisional-level combat and supporting units.|$|E
50|$|At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1970s and <b>the</b> {{beginning}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1980s, <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> rock scene saw <b>the</b> emergence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{great number}} <b>of</b> new wave bands, closely associated to <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> punk rock scene. Bregović was {{fascinated with the}} new scene, especially by <b>the</b> works <b>of</b> Azra and Prljavo Kazalište. During 1980, Bijelo Dugme decided to move towards new sound.|$|R

25|$|The most {{significant}} change to <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SFRY occurred in 1954, when the adjacent Free Territory of Trieste was dissolved by <b>the</b> Treaty <b>of</b> Osimo. <b>The</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> Zone B, which covered 515.5km², became part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SFRY. Zone B was already occupied by <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> National Army.|$|R
5|$|The Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, {{signed on}} 10 September 1919 {{observed}} that Maribor was firmly {{under the control}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> army and that, since Slovenes constituted {{a majority in the}} region surrounding the city, Maribor should remain, with the rest of Lower Styria, within the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.|$|E
5|$|The attacking force {{included}} JNA soldiers conscripted {{from across}} Yugoslavia, {{members of the}} TO, Chetniks (Serbian nationalist paramilitaries), local Serb militiamen and units <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> Navy and the Yugoslav Air Force. At their peak, the Yugoslav and Serb forces {{in the vicinity of}} Vukovar numbered about 36,000. They were equipped with heavy artillery, rockets and tanks and supported by aircraft and naval vessels on the Danube.|$|E
5|$|The {{breakup of}} Yugoslavia began in 1992, the territories {{consisting}} of Serbia, Montenegro, and Kosovo composed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In the midst <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> Wars, the United States {{as well as}} an overwhelming majority of states from the United Nations severed economic ties and imposed sanctions on FR Yugoslavia on May 30, 1992.|$|E

50|$|Founded in 1919, {{the club}} mainly {{participated in the}} {{regional}} leagues during <b>the</b> early <b>Yugoslav</b> era. They achieved their first notable success by defeating Dinamo Zagreb 3-1 in <b>the</b> first round <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1973 <b>Yugoslav</b> Cup. <b>The</b> club also competed for three seasons in <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> Second League from 1981 until 1984.|$|R
25|$|The federal {{criminal}} code for Yugoslavia also protected <b>the</b> presidents <b>of</b> federal institutions, <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> Army and federal emblems. Both the Serbian and federal Yugoslav laws granted limited exemptions to journalists. The result was multiple charges against {{a variety of}} people opposed to <b>the</b> policies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Serbian and <b>Yugoslav</b> governments even including a Serbian cartoonist who designed political satire.|$|R
5|$|After World War II, Croatia {{became a}} single-party socialist federal {{unit of the}} SFR Yugoslavia, ruled by the Communists, but enjoying a degree of {{autonomy}} within the federation. In 1967, Croatian authors and linguists published a Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Standard Language demanding greater autonomy for Croatian language. The declaration contributed to a national movement seeking greater civil rights and decentralization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> economy, culminating in the Croatian Spring of 1971, suppressed by Yugoslav leadership. Still, the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution gave increased autonomy to federal units, basically fulfilling a goal of the Croatian Spring, and providing a legal basis for independence of the federative constituents.|$|E
5|$|Croatian courts indicted Veljko Kadijević and Blagoje Adžić, former commanders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> Army, for {{war crimes}} in Vukovar. Adžić {{died of natural causes}} in Belgrade in March 2012, and never faced trial. Kadijević fled Yugoslavia {{following}} Milošević's overthrow and sought asylum in Russia. He was granted Russian citizenship in 2008, and died in Moscow in November 2014. In 2011, a Serbian court indicted more than 40 Croatians for alleged war crimes committed in Vukovar, but an earlier indictment against a Croatian soldier was dropped because of irregularities in the investigation.|$|E
5|$|Following the massacres, many Serbs from Glina and its {{surroundings}} fled to Serbia or were deported to Ustaše-controlled concentration camps. The NDH collapsed in May 1945, {{and the following}} year the Nuremberg trials judged that the persecution experienced by Serbs in the country was a crime of genocide. Local Serbs returned to Glina after the war, partly out {{of a desire to}} remain near the graves of their deceased family members, and lived peacefully alongside their Croat neighbours until the outbreak <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> Wars in the 1990s.|$|E
50|$|After {{the attack}} the Ustaše pulled back to Velebit with no casualties. Despite <b>the</b> small scale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uprising, <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> {{authorities}} were unnerved because <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ustaše was unknown. As a result, major security measures were introduced. This action {{had an impact}} in the foreign media, especially among the Italian and Hungarian press.|$|R
50|$|Beograd (Serbian Cyrillic: Београд, trans. Belgrade) is a Serbian {{and former}} Yugoslav synthpop band, notable as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pioneers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former <b>Yugoslav</b> {{electronic}} music scene.|$|R

5|$|In 1969, the Kosovar Albanian {{population}} {{was able to}} use the Albanian flag as its national flag. However, the flag had to be charged with a red star, since this was a common symbol <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> nation. Even without this requirement, the flag of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania at the time had a red star, outlined in gold, above the double headed eagle. Later on, different nationalities in Kosovo could use their own national flags in accordance with legislation.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the Appeals Court in Rome tried Opačić, General Ljubomir Bajić, {{commander}} of the 5th Aviation Corps, and Colonel Božidar Martinović, head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> Air Defence operational centre in Belgrade in absentia for the attack. Opačić and Bajić were convicted and each sentenced to 28 years in prison, while Martinović was acquitted. The court also ordered Serbia to pay compensation to families of those killed in the attack, in the provisional amount of 950,000 Euros. In a 2008 interview, Šišić said he regretted {{the deaths of the}} crew but felt no remorse for his actions.|$|E
5|$|In the 1945 election, the Communists were unopposed {{because the}} other parties abstained. Once in power, the Communists {{introduced}} a single-party political system, in which the Communist Party of Yugoslavia was the ruling party and the Communist Party of Croatia was its branch. In 1971, the Croatian national movement, which sought greater civil rights and the decentralisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> economy, culminated in the Croatian Spring, which was suppressed by the Yugoslav leadership. In January 1990, the Communist Party fragmented along national lines; the Croatian faction demanded a looser federation.|$|E

25|$|Concurrent ground {{operations}} – The KLA undertook operations in Kosovo itself {{and had some}} successes against Serb forces. <b>The</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> army abandoned a border post opposite Morinë near <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> army outpost at Kosare in <b>the</b> north west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> province. <b>The</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> army outpost at Kosare remained in <b>Yugoslav</b> hands throughout <b>the</b> war: this allowed for a supply line {{to be set up}} into the province and <b>the</b> subsequent taking <b>of</b> territory in <b>the</b> Junik area. The KLA also penetrated a few miles into the south-western Mount Pastrik area. But most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> province remained under Serb control.|$|R
50|$|By <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> 1944, <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> Communist Party began <b>the</b> {{development}} <b>of</b> alternative {{plans for}} {{establishment of a}} Balkan Federation. Because Churchill and Stalin agreed that Greece would be in <b>the</b> Western sphere <b>of</b> influence, <b>the</b> plans had to exclude Greece.|$|R
5|$|Jovanović {{composed}} the first, and most famous, {{version of the}} The Wounded Montenegrin in 1882 while studying at the Vienna Academy. It was sold to a merchant named Schwartz in Vienna later that year. Within several months, Schwartz sold the painting to a Budapest casino for 1,000 florins. After World War II, it came into the possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> embassy in Budapest, which gifted it to the Matica Srpska gallery in 1971, where it is on permanent display. It is catalogued under inventory code ГМС Y/3912.|$|E
5|$|Operation Labrador {{was headed}} by Colonel General Slobodan Rakočević, head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> Air Force {{branch of the}} KOS, based in Zemun. In Zagreb, {{operational}} control of Labrador was assigned to Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Sabolović, and Major Čedo Knežević. Lieutenant Colonel Radenko Radojčić was tasked with the storage of a substantial quantity of explosives in Zagreb and its surrounding areas and the subsequent planting of explosive devices in designated locations. The explosives and other munitions were stored across several sites.|$|E
5|$|The 1991 {{siege of}} Kijevo {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} conflicts in the Croatian War of Independence.

The initial siege was lifted after negotiations that followed major protests in Split against the JNA.|$|E

50|$|During <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> wars <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1990s, <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> a Greater Serbia {{was widely}} seen outside <b>of</b> Serbia as <b>the</b> {{motivating}} {{force for the}} military campaigns undertaken to form and sustain Serbian states on <b>the</b> territories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breakaway <b>Yugoslav</b> republics <b>of</b> Croatia (<b>the</b> Republic <b>of</b> Serbian Krajina) and Bosnia and Herzegovina (the Republika Srpska).|$|R
