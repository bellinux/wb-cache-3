Ribbentrop's friendship with Papen, which went back to 1918, ended over this issue.

500|$|In October, the MRC {{were given}} the order to seize control of Petrograd's key transport, communication, {{printing}} and utilities hubs, doing so without bloodshed. While the insurrection was taking place, Lenin gave {{a speech to the}} Petrograd Soviet announcing that the Provisional Government had been overthrown. However, at this point the government had yet to surrender, instead being under siege from armed Bolsheviks within the Winter Palace; when a Bolshevik ship, the Aurora, sailed along the palace and opened fire on it the government eventually surrendered, with the ministers being imprisoned. The Bolsheviks declared the formation of a new government, the Council of People's Commissars or [...] "Sovnarkom"; although Lenin had initially turned down the leading position of Chairman, suggesting Trotsky for the job, the other Bolsheviks refused to accept this and ultimately Lenin relented. Lenin and other Bolsheviks then attended the Second Congress of Soviets, held over 26 and 27 October and dominated by Bolshevik-controlled urban soviets rather than their rural counterparts. There they announced the creation of the new government, but were condemned by Menshevik attendees, who lambasted the Bolshevik coup as illegitimate and warned that it could lead to civil war. In these early days of the new regime, Lenin avoided talking in explicitly Marxist and socialist phraseology, fearing that in doing so he might alienate much of Russia's population, and instead he focused <b>on</b> <b>talking</b> about the establishment of a new form of government in which the country was controlled by the workers.|$|E

Despite his dislike of travelling, he toured in Britain, Ireland, and, on five occasions, North America. [...] His drawing-room sketches included his own popular songs, such as [...] "See me Dance the Polka", [...] "The Happy Fatherland", [...] "The Polka and the Choir-boy", [...] "Thou of My Thou", [...] "The French Verbs", [...] "Go <b>on</b> <b>Talking</b> – Don't Mind Me", [...] "I Don't Mind Flies". [...] His new sketches during this period included Modern Music and Morals (1889), On Tour; or, Piano and I (1891), A Seaside Holiday (1892), Fashionable Music (1892) and Is Music a Failure? (1892). According to The Times, [...] "His genial satire was enjoyed even by those at whom its shafts were aimed." [...] When he toured Scotland in the autumn of 1890, Grossmith gave a command performance for Queen Victoria at Balmoral Castle. He also composed the music for a three-act comic opera with a libretto by Gilbert, Haste to the Wedding (1892). [...] In this piece, his son George Grossmith Jr. made his stage debut. [...] Musically more challenging than any composition he had attempted before, this work was unsuccessful. [...] Later, however, Grossmith said that the experience of writing with Gilbert was one of the happiest of his life. In 1892–93 he toured North America (his second tour there), writing successful new sketches, [...] "How I Discovered America" [...] and [...] "Baby on the Shore" [...] (1893).|$|E
