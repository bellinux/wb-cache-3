5|$|The 18-valence {{electron}} rhodium(III) pentadienediyl species {{generated by}} this reaction demonstrates again {{the instability of}} the rhodocene moiety, in {{that it can be}} refluxed in toluene for months without 1,2,3-tri-tert-butylrhodocene forming but in <b>oxidising</b> <b>conditions</b> the 1,2,3-tri-tert-butylrhodocenium cation forms rapidly. Cyclic voltammetry has been used to investigate this and similar processes in detail. The mechanism of the reaction has been shown to involve a loss of one electron from the pentadienediyl ligand followed by a fast rearrangement (with loss of a hydrogen atom) to form the 1,2,3-tri-tert-butylrhodocenium cation. Both the tetrafluoroborate and hexafluorophosphate salts of this cation have been structurally characterised by X-ray crystallography.|$|E
5|$|These data clearly {{indicate}} {{the stability of}} neutral ferrocene and the cobaltocenium and rhodocenium cations. Rhodocene is ca. 500mV more reducing than cobaltocene, indicating {{that it is more}} readily oxidised and hence less stable. An earlier polarographic investigation of rhodocenium perchlorate at neutral pH showed a cathodic wave peak at −1.53V (versus SCE) at the dropping mercury electrode, corresponding to the formation rhodocene in solution, but the researchers were unable to isolate the neutral product from solution. In the same study, attempts to detect iridocene by exposing iridocenium salts to <b>oxidising</b> <b>conditions</b> were unsuccessful even at elevated pH.

The predisposing factors can be exacerbated by drugs that affect hepatic lipid metabolism. The aim of the present work {{was to determine if}} raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) used extensively by postmenopausal women, affects hepatic fatty acid oxidation pathways. Fatty acids oxidation was measured in the livers, mitochondria and peroxisomes of ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation was inhibited by raloxifene at a concentration range of 2. 5 – 25 μM. In perfused livers, raloxifene reduced the ketogenesis from endogenous and exogenous fatty acids and increased the β-hydroxybutyrate/acetoacetate ratio. An increase in 14 CO 2 production without a parallel increase in the oxygen consumption indicated that raloxifene caused a diversion of NADH from the mitochondrial respiratory chain to another oxidative reaction. It was found that raloxifene has a strong ability to react with H 2 O 2 in the presence of peroxidase. It is likely that the generation of phenoxyl radical derivatives of raloxifene in intact livers led to the co-oxidation of NADH and a shift of the cellular redox state to an <b>oxidised</b> <b>condition.</b> This change can perturb other important liver metabolic processes dependent on cellular NADH/NAD+ ratio...|$|R

30|$|As for {{the origin}} of the calcium and iron phosphate, the change in the burial environment, {{particularly}} the more <b>oxidising</b> <b>condition</b> and the interaction with Ca-rich circulating ground water, promoted the transformation of vivianite into a hydrated calcium and iron phosphate. Mitridatite is in these samples not crystalline since it formed through an Ostwald step sequence after vivianite. In such situation, the transformation stopped at a higher Gibbs energy, with the amorphous particles characterised by a lower superficial energy than if the mitridatite were in crystalline form. Therefore, the transformation determined the formation of an amorphous phase with a chemical composition consistent with that of mitridatite, which could in fact eventually evolve to crystalline mitridatite. Both thermodynamic and kinetic factors influenced the transformation and inhibited the crystallization of mitridatite. The amorphous state of this secondary phase can be also observed from its optical behaviour (Fig.  2 a, b) under a petrographic microscope, as the lack of interference colours is compatible with a cubic or, as it is the case, an amorphous phase. It is important to remark that the bulk mineralogical composition of the pottery obtained using conventional XRPD bearing these secondary phases does not comprise any phosphate [6], due to their low content and to the fact that only part of them (vivianite) is crystalline.|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{feasibility of}} focusing both surface- and basinal-derived fluids towards sites of iron ore genesis during Proterozoic deformation in the Hamersley Province is tested here by computer simulation. Finite difference modelling of porous media flow during extensional deformation {{of a mountain}} range shows that surface fluids are drawn towards areas of failure and focus into {{the centre of the}} mountain. The addition of permeable structures such as a normal fault provides focused fluid pathways in which mechanical and geological conditions are particularly conducive to both upward and downward flow. Upward flow {{from the base of the}} fault within the model overall is favoured by low permeability basement materials and supra-hydrostatic pore pressures. Downward migration of fluids becomes more prominent as extension progresses and upward fluid flow from the base diminishes. The introduction of sedimentary layering into the models allows lateral fluid flow, such that sites of potential fluid mixing may then occur within permeable iron formation units close to the fault zone. Allowing parts of the stratigraphy to become more permeable as a function of high fluid flux simulates permeability enhancement by silica dissolution as a mechanism for iron ore genesis. The involvement of both basinal and surficial fluids in the genesis of the ore deposits is supported by the mechanical models and in addition provides an explanation for a progression from relatively reduced to <b>oxidised</b> <b>conditions</b> at the Mt Tom Price deposit (and possibly other large deposits) with time...|$|R

Then the vent was closed and green wood introduced, creating carbon monoxide which turns the red hematite to black magnetite (Fe3O4); at this stage the temperature decreases due to incomplete combustion. In a final reoxidizing phase (at about 800-850 °C) the kiln was opened and oxygen reintroduced causing the unslipped reserved clay to go back to orange-red.In the previous phase, chemical composition of the slipped surface had been altered, so it could no longer be oxidized and remained black.

A significant effect {{of the degree of}} staging was seen in the two lower locations: At 0. 65 m height the fraction of time under substoichiometric conditions was low in the no-staging case (2 - 35 %), at normal staging it was 70 - 90 %, whereas at intensified staging it was 100 Y [...] At 0. 35 m height, i. e. in the dense bed, a similar effect was seen, although the fraction of time under reducing conditions was lower. The fraction of time under reducing conditions was low {{in the top of the}} combustion chamber in all three cases. The increase in the fraction of time under reducing conditions with a higher degree of staging is associated with a decrease in sulphur capture.

40|$|International audienceThe better {{understanding}} of airburst processes from geological data and simulation suggests that the high-temperature jet of expanding gas formed from the projectile explosion in the Earth atmosphere would generate a descending fireball. The hypothesis of frequent low altitude airbursts {{in the recent past}} thus incites to question the possible occurrence in the Quaternary records of airblast-linked firing events. Here we compare the field/analytical characteristics of undisputable airblasts and impact craters to anomalous firing records. The reference impact situations comprise (1) the peat layer of the 1908 Tunguska explosion; (2) the Henbury crater field, Australia; (3) the early mid-Pleistocene tektite layers at Bose (south China); (3) the Darwin glass strewnfield, Tasmania. The debated impact-linked combustion records comprise in situ fired soil surfaces from the mid to late Holocene framed by AMS C 14 dates, and distinctive dark-brown humic layers with charred fragments from continental deposits of West Europe dated at 0. 8, 1. 2 - 1. 4, 2. 4 Ma on the basis of magnetostratigraphy. All the situations display a similar assemblage of exogenous intact rock clasts, partly melted brecciated debris, and rapidly quenched heterogeneous glass, fluidal glass in the form of shards, spherules, beads, and vesicular blocks. The exotic mineral phases occur with native metals and carbonaceous components, all of terrestrial origin. The polymer films, vitreous carbon, carbonaceous fibres, graphite and the associated diamond polymorphs are shown to derive from high temperature pyrogenesis of biomass precursors and fossil combustible. The moderate heating under <b>oxidised</b> <b>conditions</b> of the host soil surface contrasts from the high temperature heating under reduced conditions of the melted debris. The coherent spatial pattern at small scales of the carbon-rich glassy debris within the burnt surface suggests local ignition by pulverisation of a hot debris-jet. The fine association of carbonaceous films with metal and glass droplets within the carbonized vegetation showing CO 2 degassing demonstrates the great volatility of the pyrogenic components transported in the debris-jet. Local strewnfields of impact-ejecta debris lying on a heated soil surface are suggested to trace airblasts from isolated projectiles with local and short-term damage. The mosaic of impact-ejecta strewnfields at all spatial scales with local firing would express short periods of serial airblasts associated to subtle climate effects due to the production of carbonaceous aerosols.
