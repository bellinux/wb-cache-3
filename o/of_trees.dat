5|$|Silviculture is the {{practice}} of controlling the establishment, growth, composition, health, and quality of forests, which are areas that have a high density <b>of</b> <b>trees.</b> Cultivated trees are planted and tended by humans, usually because they provide food (fruits or nuts), ornamental beauty, or some type of wood product that benefits people. An area of land planted with fruit or nut trees is an orchard. A small wooded area, usually with no undergrowth, is called a grove and a small wood or thicket <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> and bushes is called a coppice or copse. A large area of land covered with trees and undergrowth is called woodland or forest. An area of woodland composed primarily <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> established by planting or artificial seeding {{is known as a}} plantation.|$|E

Anyone who is planning on removing or trimming the trees has to obtain an indigenous tree permit.
