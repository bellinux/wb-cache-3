500|$|Rodgers {{composed}} the music once {{he received the}} lyrics from Hammerstein. [...] A number of stories are told of {{the speed with which}} he wrote the music for South Pacifics numbers. [...] "Happy Talk" [...] was said to have been composed in about twenty minutes; when Hammerstein, who had sent the lyrics by messenger, called to check whether Rodgers had received them, his partner informed him that he had both lyrics and music. Legend has it he composed [...] "Bali Ha'i" [...] in ten minutes <b>over</b> <b>coffee</b> in Logan's apartment; what he did create in that time frame was the three-note motif which begins both song and musical. [...] Hammerstein's lyrics for [...] "Bali Ha'i" [...] were inspired by the stage backdrop which designer Jo Mielziner had painted. [...] Feeling that the island of Bali Ha'i did not appear mysterious enough, Mielziner painted some mist near the summit of its volcano. When Hammerstein saw this he immediately thought of the lyric, [...] "my head sticking up from a low-flying cloud" [...] {{and the rest of the}} song followed easily from that.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} The Elephant Man (1980), Lynch met producer Richard Roth <b>over</b> <b>coffee.</b> Roth {{had read}} and enjoyed Lynch's Ronnie Rocket script, {{but did not}} think it was something he wanted to produce. He asked Lynch if the filmmaker had any other scripts, but the director only had ideas. [...] "I told him I had always wanted to sneak into a girl's room to watch her into the night and that, maybe, at one point or another, I would see something that would be the clue to a murder mystery. Roth loved the idea and asked me to write a treatment. I went home and thought of the ear in the field." [...] Production was announced in August 1984. Lynch wrote two more drafts before he was satisfied with the script of the film. Conditions at this point were ideal for Lynch's film: he had made a deal with Dino De Laurentiis that gave him complete artistic freedom and final cut privileges, with the stipulation that the filmmaker take a cut in his salary and work with a budget of only $6 million. This deal meant that Blue Velvet was the smallest film on the De Laurentiis' slate. Consequently, Lynch would be left mostly unsupervised during production. [...] "After Dune I was down so far that anything was up! So it was just a euphoria. And when you work with that kind of feeling, you can take chances. You can experiment." [...] Because the material was completely different from anything that would be considered mainstream at the time, Laurentiis had to start his own company to distribute it.|$|E

2500|$|Sunbury Pop Festival was {{an annual}} Australian rock music festival {{that was the}} seventh {{of more than a}} dozen major outdoor rock festivals staged in Australia between 1970 and 1975, but it was the only one that became a {{continuing}} event, at least for four years. It was promoted by Odessa Promotions, which was formed by a group of television professionals headed by John Fowler from GTV9 in Melbourne. Festival publicist Jim McKay recalled, [...] "It was a good idea <b>over</b> <b>coffee</b> at the Channel Nine canteen... We were a bit bored, wondering what to do next... Why don't we do a pop festival, like Woodstock?" [...] From late 1971, Odessa Promotions touted the forthcoming festival as [...] "41 hours of non-stop entertainment. Sunbury, the rock happening of 1972. Three days of sun-filled togetherness".|$|E
2500|$|Joe/009 {{makes an}} {{appearance}} in Chapter 36 of the Skull Man manga, in a chance meeting with Ryuusei Chisato, the Skull Man. Both discuss {{the nature of}} evil and humanity <b>over</b> <b>coffee,</b> and meet again by chance when the Skull Man stops a dirty deal by politicians {{going on at the}} docks. The 2007 Skull Man anime was set up as a prequel of Cyborg 009, with many of the events in the series finale setting up Cyborg 009. The 1997 anime King of Braves GaoGaiGar, the character Soldato J is a tribute to Jet Link/002, sharing his love of flight, acceleration mode, and characteristic nose. J's number in the Corps to which he belongs is 002, further reinforcing this link. Shotaro Ishinomori later created Himitsu Sentai Goranger and J.A.K.Q. Dengekitai, the latter series being especially similar to Cyborg 009 in terms of characters and premise. The Mega Man video game [...] character Proto Man is also visually inspired by Cyborg 009.|$|E

60|$|Tuesday, July 23.--We dined under a bare trellis erected for the Fourth of July; {{and here}} we used to linger by lamplight <b>over</b> <b>coffee</b> and tobacco. In that climate evening {{approaches}} without sensible chill; the wind dies out before sunset; heaven glows a while and fades, and darkens into the blueness of the tropical night; swiftly and insensibly the shadows thicken, the stars multiply their number; you look around you and the day is gone. It was then that we would see our Chinaman draw near across the compound in a lurching sphere of light, divided by his shadows; and {{with the coming of}} the lamp the night closed about the table. The faces of the company, the spars of the trellis, stood out suddenly bright on a ground of blue and silver, faintly designed with palm-tops and the peaked roofs of houses. Here and there the gloss upon a leaf, or the fracture of a stone, returned an isolated sparkle. All else had vanished. We hung there, illuminated like a galaxy of stars in vacuo; we sat, manifest and blind, amid the general ambush of the darkness; and the islanders, passing with light footfalls and low voices in the sand of the road, lingered to observe us, unseen.|$|E
