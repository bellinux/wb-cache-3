5000|$|As of 2011, Fednav owns a fleet <b>of</b> 23 <b>ships.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ships</b> {{were built}} between 1978 and 2006.

5|$|Most of the ship's wooden hull was lost, but {{the layout}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> {{could be seen}} from the {{placement}} of the anchors, guns and fasteners.|$|E
5|$|The Russians did {{not believe}} that super firing turrets offered any {{advantage}} as they discounted the value of axial fire, believed that broadside fire was much more important and also believed that super firing turrets could not fire while over the lower turret because of muzzle blast interfering with the open sighting hoods in the lower turret's roof. They therefore designed the ships with a 'linear' arrangement (lineinoe raspolozhenie) of turrets distributed over the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> This arrangement had several advantages because it reduced the stress on the ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> since the turrets were not concentrated at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> increased stability because the lack of elevated turrets and their barbettes, improved the survivability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> because the magazines were separated from each other and gave a lower silhouette. Disadvantages were that the magazines had to be put {{in the middle of all}} the machinery, which required steam pipes to be run through or around them and the lack of deck space free from blast. This greatly complicated the placement of the anti-torpedo boat guns which ultimately had to be mounted in the hull, closer to the water than was desirable.|$|E

25|$|With {{both the}} Browns and Eckford active at Sackets Harbor, {{it has become}} a bit murky as to what extent Eckford was {{involved}} in <b>the</b> building <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> there. He was in charge of all shipbuilding there and probably prepared plans for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships,</b> but <b>the</b> Browns' contracts were independent of his, proposals for the Browns and Eckford to combine forces to build some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> do not appear to have borne fruit, and some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> <b>the</b> Browns built may have borrowed from Eckford's plans without him being otherwise involved in their construction. Despite tradition that he was, Eckford may not have been in involved <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> New Orleans, but Lady <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lake, Superior, General Pike, Madison, and Mohawk were his.|$|R
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{were moved}} {{on a system}} of wheeled trolleys running on Décauville rails that extended throughout each half-hangar to the quarterdeck at the rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> The torpedo bombers would be moved to the quarterdeck where their wings would be extended {{and then they would}} be lowered into the water by the large crane at the very stern <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} eight 7-inch 45-caliber {{guns were}} distributed four per side, in casemates {{on the side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> below the main deck.|$|E

5|$|The {{upper deck}} housed {{facilities}} for officers and first- and second-class passengers. A long forecastle contained the accommodations {{for the crew}} and petty officers, {{as well as a}} hospital and the third-class lavatories. First-class staterooms for 106 passengers were located close to the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> To their rear, between the funnels, was the first-class passenger dining room, spanning the width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> With seating for 208, it featured mahogany furniture and satinwood paneling with inlays, and a glass skylight ceiling that extended up through two decks. Beyond this area were the galleys, sculleries, and pantries that served all passenger classes. Moving further aft, the second-class passenger dining room, which could accommodate 120 diners, was next. It, too, spanned the width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> and featured mahogany furniture, but was paneled with tapestry upon a cream-colored ground. Beyond the dining area were cabins for 76 second-class passengers.|$|E

5|$|With this vote-of-confidence in place, BTF {{contracted}} with an independent maritime engineering firm {{to make a}} survey <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> to determine her condition. If the ship is not structurally sound enough to support herself when permanently resting on keel blocks, then the question of dry berthing would be moot. The survey reflected that, although her hull leaks, her keel and main supporting internal structure is sufficiently strong to support the weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> in a dry berth.|$|E
5|$|A naval {{board of}} inquiry was {{appointed}} shortly afterwards that determined {{the cause of}} the collision was of a lack of seamanship by the captain and watch officers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> The Justice Minister, Kobie Coetsee, subsequently introduced a retrospective change in law to allow him to hold an inquest into the death of the only crewman whose body was found. The inquest lasted a year and apportioned blame on the captain and PWO.|$|E

5|$|A ship {{received}} {{by a pair}} of induction coils hung on opposite sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> and fed through an amplifier into a headset (see diagram, below). By switching between coils, the relative strength of the signal on each side could be compared. The ship maintained a course parallel to the cable by maneuvering to keep the signal strength constant.|$|E
5|$|After the Gibraltar hearings, Mary Celeste {{continued}} in service under new owners. In 1885, her captain deliberately wrecked her {{off the coast of}} Haiti, as part of an attempted insurance fraud. The story of her 1872 abandonment has been recounted and dramatized many times, in documentaries, novels, plays and films, and the name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> has become a byword for unexplained desertion.|$|E
5|$|After {{twenty minutes}} {{fighting}} both Victory and Temeraire, the Redoutable {{had been reduced}} to a floating wreck. Temeraire had also suffered heavily, damaged when Redoutables main mast fell onto her poop deck, and having had her own topmasts shot away. Informed that his ship was in danger of sinking, Lucas finally called for quarter to the Temeraire. Harvey sent a party across under the second lieutenant, John Wallace, to take charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|E
