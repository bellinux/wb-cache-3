5|$|Although many of {{the coins}} bear {{the name of a}} moneyer, there is no {{indication}} of the mint where each coin was struck.

5|$|NOTE: <b>Opinion</b> <b>is</b> divided {{about the}} size of an ala turma, between 30 and 32 men. 30 {{was the size of a}} turma in the Republican cavalry and in the cohors equitata of the Principate auxilia.

5|$|Support for {{establishing}} a republic {{instead of a}} monarchy was around 18 per cent in the United Kingdom in 2006, while a majority thinks that {{there will still be}} a monarchy in the United Kingdom in ten years' time, public <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> rather uncertain about a monarchy still existing in fifty years and a clear majority believes that the monarchy will no longer exist a century after the poll. Public <b>opinion</b> <b>is,</b> however, certain that the monarchy will still exist in thirty years. About 30 per cent are in favour of discontinuing the monarchy after Elizabeth's death.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the limited}} form of {{judicial}} review available under the ISA, whether a person remains under detention depends largely on the Ministry of Home Affairs. This raises the question quis custodiet ipsos custodes? – who guards the guardians? If preventive detention is applied illegitimately {{in a manner that}} cripples lawful democratic opposition, the absence of judicial review would preclude the exposure of such abuse. It has been submitted that the voice of public <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> most suited for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|For {{the size}} of limitanei units, <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> divided. Jones and Elton suggest from the scarce and {{ambiguous}} literary evidence that border legiones numbered c. 1,000 men and that the other units contained {{in the region of}} 500 men each. Others draw on papyrus and more recent archaeological evidence to argue that limitanei units probably averaged about half the Jones/Elton strength i.e. c. 500 for legiones and around 250 for other units.|$|E

5|$|Sanders {{says that}} Jesus' mission {{was not about}} repentance, {{although}} he acknowledges that this <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> unpopular. He argues that repentance appears as a strong theme only in Luke, that repentance was John the Baptist's message, and that Jesus' ministry {{would not have been}} scandalous if the sinners he ate with had been repentant. According to Theissen and Merz, Jesus taught that God was generously giving people an opportunity to repent.|$|E

Where public <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> that a player's bowling action appears to be that he routinely throws, he is said to have a 'suspect' or an 'illegal' action, or more derogatorily, is said to be a 'chucker'. The issue is often highly emotive with accusers considering that deliveries with an illegal action are akin to cheating.|$|E
5|$|As the {{traditional}} method of making borscht with beet sour often requires planning {{at least several}} days ahead, many recipes for quicker borscht replace the beet sour with fresh beetroot juice, while the sour taste is imparted by other ingredients, such as vinegar, lemon juice or citric acid, tomatoes, tart apples, dry red wine, dill pickle juice, sauerkraut juice, or a fermented rye flour and water mixture. The soup is typically flavored with {{a wide selection of}} herbs, spices and condiments. Salt, black pepper, garlic, bay leaves and dill are among the most commonly used. Other aromatics often added to borscht include allspice, celery stalks, parsley, marjoram, hot peppers, saffron, horseradish, ginger and prunes. Some recipes require flour or roux to further thicken the borscht. A common <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> that a good borscht should be thick enough for a spoon to stand upright in it.|$|E
5|$|Belief that Cooper did {{not survive}} was bolstered {{by the fact that}} none of the money has ever been used. A {{quantity}} was found under riverbank silt, but its location is not consistent with Cooper dying or losing the ransom in the jump. This, combined with the knowledge that with law enforcement involved, a ransom would in effect be 100% bait money (a fact known to the public since the trial following the Lindbergh kidnapping) makes it less likely that Cooper had any intention of actually using the ransom money. A minority <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> that a North American of Cooper's apparent sophistication could hardly have expected to spend or fence currency as hot as the ransom would predictably be, and he had carried out a planned dumping of the money before disappearing.|$|E

5|$|Constitutional {{questions}} {{may also be}} referred to the Tribunal when Parliament attempts to circumvent or curtail the discretionary powers conferred on the President by the Constitution. If the attempt is by way of an ordinary bill, the President can exercise personal discretion to withhold assent to it. It is then open to Cabinet to advise the President {{to refer to the}} Tribunal the question whether the bill in fact circumvents or curtails his discretionary powers. If the bill is determined by the Tribunal not to have that effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day following the day when the Tribunal's <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> pronounced in open court. When Article 5A of the Constitution is brought into force, a similar procedure will apply to attempts to circumvent or curtail the President's discretionary powers through a constitutional amendment. If the Tribunal rules that the proposed amendment does have the effect of restricting the discretionary powers of the President, the Prime Minister is entitled to submit the bill to a national referendum for approval.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{integration}} of southern Vietnam into the central administration, newly appointed imperial officials arrived in Saigon. The new mandarins carried out a detailed inquiry into Duyệt's rule and claimed that widespread corruption and abuse of power took place. Bạch Xuân Nguyên, {{the head of the}} inquiry, called for Duyet's posthumous prosecution, which resulted in 100 lashes being applied to his grave. Many of Duyệt's subordinates were arrested and 16 of his family members were executed. This action prompted the Duyệt's officials—fearful of their positions and security under the central system—to launch a revolt under the leadership of his adopted son Lê Văn Khôi. Historical <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> divided with scholars contesting whether the humiliation of Duyệt or the loss of southern autonomy was the main catalyst.|$|E
5|$|Going {{into the}} 1994 Australian Grand Prix, the final {{race of the}} 1994 season, Schumacher led Damon Hill by a single point in the Drivers' Championship.

At the next corner Hill attempted {{to pass on the}} inside, but Schumacher turned in sharply and they collided. Both cars were eliminated from the race and, as neither driver scored, Schumacher took the title. The race stewards judged it a racing accident and took no action against either driver, but public <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> divided over the incident, and Schumacher was vilified in the British media.|$|E

5|$|Guinea pigs do not {{generally}} thrive when housed with other species. Housing of guinea pigs with other rodents such as gerbils and hamsters may increase instances of respiratory and other infections, and such rodents may act aggressively toward the guinea pig. Larger animals may regard guinea pigs as prey, though some (such as dogs) {{can be trained}} to accept them. <b>Opinion</b> <b>is</b> divided over the cohousing of guinea pigs and domestic rabbits. Some published sources say that guinea pigs and rabbits complement each other well when sharing a cage. However, as lagomorphs, rabbits have different nutritional requirements, so the two species cannot be fed the same food. Rabbits may also harbor diseases (such as respiratory infections from Bordetella and Pasteurella), to which guinea pigs are susceptible. Even the dwarf rabbit is much stronger than the guinea pig and may cause intentional or inadvertent injury.|$|E
5|$|Having {{published}} many novels, {{essays and}} short stories, Narayan {{is credited with}} bringing Indian writing {{to the rest of}} the world. While he has been regarded as one of India's greatest writers of the twentieth century, critics have also described his writings with adjectives such as charming, harmless and benign. Narayan has also come in for criticism from later writers, particularly of Indian origin, who have classed his writings as having a pedestrian style with a shallow vocabulary and a narrow vision. According to Shashi Tharoor, Narayan's subjects are similar to those of Jane Austen as they both deal with a very small section of society. However, he adds that while Austen's prose was able to take those subjects beyond ordinariness, Narayan's was not. A similar <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> held by Shashi Deshpande who characterizes Narayan's writings as pedestrian and naive because of the simplicity of his language and diction, combined with the lack of any complexity in the emotions and behaviours of his characters.|$|E
5|$|In 1092 {{and again}} in 1093 the dispute with Canterbury resurfaced, when Thomas complained about what he felt were {{infringements}} of York's rights. The first of these occasions was over the dedication of Remigius de Fécamp's new cathedral at Lincoln and the second concerned the consecration of Anselm as Archbishop of Canterbury. Thomas refused to consecrate Anselm if the latter {{was referred to as}} Primate of England. The impasse was finally resolved by naming Anselm the Metropolitan of Canterbury. The medieval chronicler Eadmer, Anselm's biographer and a Canterbury partisan, says that Anselm was consecrated as the primate. Hugh the Chanter, {{who was a member of}} the York community, stated that the metropolitan title was used. Modern historical <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> divided, with Frank Barlow, author of The English Church 1066–1154 inclined towards the primatial title, but with Richard Southern, in his biography of Anselm, leaning towards the metropolitan title. The whole affair is probably subject to much duplicity and dishonesty, with both sides presenting biased accounts.|$|E
