5|$|Representative {{of the new}} {{historical}} perspective is the 2003 biography by Pauline Croft. Reviewer John Cramsie summarises her findings:Croft's overall assessment of James is appropriately mixed. She recognises his good intentions in matters like Anglo-Scottish union, his openness to different points of view, and his agenda of a peaceful foreign policy within his kingdoms' financial means. His actions moderated frictions between his diverse peoples. Yet he also created new ones, particularly by supporting colonisation that polarised the crown's interest groups in Ireland, obtaining insufficient political benefit with his open-handed patronage, an unfortunate lack <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> image of monarchy (particularly after the image-obsessed regime of Elizabeth), pursuing a pro-Spanish foreign policy that fired religious prejudice {{and opened the door}} for Arminians within the English church, and enforcing unpalatable religious changes on the Scottish Kirk. Many of these criticisms are framed within a longer view of James' reigns, including the legacy – now understood to be more troubled – which he left Charles I.|$|E

25|$|These {{ideas were}} {{arranged}} into a true calculus of infinitesimals by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who was originally accused of plagiarism by Newton. He is now {{regarded as an}} independent inventor of and contributor to calculus. His contribution {{was to provide a}} clear set of rules for working with infinitesimal quantities, allowing the computation of second and higher derivatives, and providing the product rule and chain rule, in their differential and integral forms. Unlike Newton, Leibniz paid a lot <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> formalism, often spending days determining appropriate symbols for concepts.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the primary}} goal of the TeX {{language}} is high-quality typesetting for publishers of books, Knuth gave a lot <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spacing rules for mathematical formulae. He took three bodies of work that he considered to be standards of excellence for mathematical typography: the books typeset by Addison-Wesley Publishing's house (the publisher of The Art of Computer Programming), in particular the work of Hans Wolf and Joseph Louis Lagrange (thermodynamics innovation, +1856); editions of the mathematical journal Acta Mathematica dating from around 1910; and a copy of Indagationes Mathematicae, a Dutch mathematics journal. Knuth looked closely at these printed papers to sort out and look for a set of rules for spacing. While TeX provides some basic rules and the tools needed to specify proper spacing, the exact parameters depend on the font used to typeset the formula. For example, the spacing for Knuth's Computer Modern fonts has been precisely fine-tuned over the years and is now set; but when other fonts, such as AMS Euler, were used by Knuth for the first time, new spacing parameters had to be defined.|$|E

500|$|The album's production, almost solely done by Dr. Dre and DJ Yella, {{was praised}} by several critics. Jason Birchmeier from Allmusic gave a {{considerable}} amount <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> album's production, saying that [...] "Dr. Dre and Yella meld together P-Funk, Def Jam-style hip hop, and the leftover electro sounds of mid-80s Los Angeles, creating a dense, funky, and thoroughly unique style of their own." [...] Birchmeier would also write that some songs—"Eazy Duz It", [...] "We Want Eazy", [...] "Eazy-er Said Than Dunn", and [...] "Radio"—are all heavily produced and have [...] "layers upon layers of samples and beats competing with Eazy-E's rhymes for attention." [...] Rapper Kanye West also touted Dr. Dre's production on the album.|$|E
500|$|In 1948, Earl Shaffer of York, Pennsylvania, {{brought a}} great deal <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> project by publicizing the first claimed thru-hike. The claim was later criticized for the hike's {{omission}} of significant portions due to short-cuts and car rides. [...] Shaffer later claimed the first north-to-south thru-hike, the first to claim {{to do so in}} each direction. Chester Dziengielewski was later to be named the first south bound thru-hiker. In 1998, Shaffer, nearly 80 years old, hiked the trail, making him the oldest person to claim a completed thru-hike. The first solo woman to complete the hike was 67-year old Emma Gatewood who completed the northbound trek in 1955, taking 146 days. She repeated the achievement two years later.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed-to-positive reviews. Ryan McGee of Zap2it {{wrote that}} [...] "this episode wasn't a stinker by any measure, {{but after the}} run of early episodes, {{this is the first}} that really didn't hold its own when compared to the others", adding that [...] "The moth imagery/metaphor just beats you down by episode's end, making you long for the more subtle writing the show has produced up until this point." [...] The TV Critic gave the episode a 68/100, writing that it falls between being [...] "obvious and cheesy" [...] and [...] "beautifully paced and structured". Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B, and shared his opinion that it is [...] "one of the more intensely metaphorical—and thus writerly—episodes of the series. The eponymous metaphor—delivered by Locke—is one of the series’ most blatant, and the moth’s consistent reappearance in the episode calls a lot <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> construction of the narrative." ...|$|E

500|$|Wihtred (c. 670– 23 April 725) {{was king}} of Kent from about 690 or 691 until his death. He was {{a son of}} Ecgberht I and a brother of Eadric. [...] Wihtred acceded to the throne after a {{confused}} period in the 680s, which included a brief conquest of Kent by Cædwalla of Wessex and subsequent dynastic conflicts. [...] His immediate predecessor was Oswine of Kent, who was probably descended from Eadbald of Kent, though not through the same line as Wihtred. [...] Shortly {{after the start of}} his reign, Wihtred issued a code of laws—the Law of Wihtred—that has been preserved in a manuscript known as the Textus Roffensis. [...] The laws pay a great deal <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rights of the Church, including punishment for irregular marriages and for pagan worship. [...] Wihtred's long reign had few incidents recorded in the annals of the day. [...] He was succeeded in 725 by his sons, Æthelberht II, Eadberht I, and Ælfric.|$|E
500|$|The game's swipe-based swordplay {{was based}} on Donald Mustard's desire for an {{uncommon}} gameplay based on nuanced sword fighting and parrying. He described the game's influences as the combat of Karateka and Prince of Persia combined with the [...] "lonely epicness" [...] of Shadow of the Colossus. Chair sought to develop an experience that could be picked up and played for a minute (a single battle) or {{for half an hour}} (a bloodline). They felt that many other developers accustomed to consoles were wrong to make iOS games that required long playing experiences to feel meaningful, and so Chair developed the bloodline concept as a natural breakpoint. They also felt that mobile games like Infinity Blade with constant action elements went too long without giving the player time to relax and resulted in player exhaustion, and so Chair kept their individual battles short with brief cinematic pauses in longer battles. Chair showed their playable demo at the Apple conference on September 1, 2010, after weeks of rehearsal, and attracted a lot <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> game. It was released on December 9, 2010. While Chair itself spent little on marketing, Apple used the game extensively in advertisements for its devices.|$|E
500|$|In Great Basin Kingdom, Arrington {{traces the}} Mormon pioneer {{practices}} of [...] "central planning, organized cooperation, and the partial socialization of investment implicit in Mormon theory" [...] {{to the democratic}} theory of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Arrington also noted that pioneers found religious significance in creating farms out of previously wild land, making irrigation central to their way of life. The way Mormons freely distributed irrigation water—through a central canal and diverted when needed—reflected their communal values. While the Mormon cooperative economy died out in the 1880s, their cooperative spirit anticipated later governmental planning. Great Basin Kingdoms thorough documentation called attention to previously hidden sources in the LDS Church Archives. Dean L. May and Donald Worster criticized Great Basin Kingdom for overreaching its thesis that organized irrigation could rejuvenate a culture. One biographer attributes Arrington's overvaluing Mormon achievements {{to a lack of}} empirical studies on pioneer settlements at the time. Still, the book was received as an instant classic that raised the standard for Mormon scholarship. Dale L. Morgan, though critical of the lack <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gentile (i.e., non-Mormon) influence on Mormons, said that it was an indispensable ordering of Mormon data. The book is still considered one of the significant books on Mormon history.|$|E

500|$|Justin Chang, {{writing for}} Variety magazine, gave the film a {{positive}} review {{and called it}} [...] "the most grueling and sustained American combat picture since Black Hawk Down, {{as well as a}} prime example of how impressive physical filmmaking can overcome even fundamental deficiencies in script and characterization." [...] Alonso Duralde, writing for The Wrap, stated, [...] "The film never makes a grand statement {{about whether or not the}} war in Afghanistan is, per se, a mistake, but it does portray war itself as a disgusting folly. Berg sets up the cathartic moments we’re used to in movies like this, but then he pulls out the rug, reminding us that the cavalry doesn’t always miraculously show up in time to save the day." [...] Todd McCarthy, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, described the film as being [...] "rugged, skilled, relentless, determined, narrow-minded and focused, everything that a soldier must be when his life is on the line," [...] while Scott Bowles of USA Today called Lone Survivor [...] "brutal, unrelenting and ultimately moving." [...] Leonard Maltin described the film as [...] "visceral", while praising Berg, the main actors, and the stunt performers for successfully reenacting the events of Operation Red Wings. Maltin concluded that the film [...] "is a tough movie but a rewarding one. It's humbling to watch this dramatization of the sacrifices these men make, without hesitation. Peter Berg was determined to do justice to them, and he has succeeded." [...] Betsy Sharkey, writing for The Los Angeles Times, praised the overall look of the film: [...] "The production and costume designers have paid a great deal <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> details, from the uniforms and tribal robes, to the bullet wounds and blood. It certainly adds to the film's verisimilitude." ...|$|E
