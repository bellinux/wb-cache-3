5|$|A July 1861 {{address to}} the people <b>of</b> <b>Bourbon</b> County, {{authored}} by Hawes and other like-minded Democrats, blamed Republicans for starting the Civil War, denounced the coercion of states {{to remain in the}} Union, and warned that the Lincoln administration would fight to end slavery. The address {{called for an end to}} the war, recognition of the Confederate States of America as a sovereign nation, and equitable distribution of the national debt and federal property.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the war, the Confederate {{government}} of Kentucky in exile ceased to exist, and Hawes returned to his home in Paris, Kentucky. He swore an oath of allegiance to the Union, and was allowed to return to his law practice. He was elected county judge <b>of</b> <b>Bourbon</b> County, a post he held until his death in 1877.|$|E

Philip died unexpectedly on 18 July 1765 in Alessandria, Italy, after having accompanied his daughter Maria Luisa on her way to Genoa, where she sailed for Spain to marry Infante Charles. Through Philip's daughter Maria Luisa, he is an ancestor <b>of</b> the <b>Bourbons</b> <b>of</b> Spain, the <b>Bourbons</b> <b>of</b> the Two Sicilies, and the House of Orléans.|$|R
5|$|For 19 years, {{the castle}} {{served as a}} prison for John I, Duke <b>of</b> <b>Bourbon</b> after he was taken at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. His {{custodian}} was a Nicholas Montgomery the Younger. Nineteenth-century local historian John Joseph Briggs claimed that during the Wars of the Roses, the castle was partially dismantled by the Lancastrian forces of Margaret of Anjou, but since her campaign was {{along the line of}} the Great North Road, it was Melbourn, Cambridgeshire she sacked, not its Derbyshire namesake.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the French Revolution, groups of royalists loyal to the House <b>of</b> <b>Bourbon</b> rose up against the new government. One group was the Chouans of Brittany, led by Jean Chouan. They allied {{themselves}} with counter-revolutionary forces in Vendée and by 1793 the Revolt in the Vendée had begun. The insurrection was put down by the republic, and within two years the royalist forces had been routed.|$|E
5|$|A 1788 {{letter in}} the Kentucky Gazette {{indicated}} that Marshall had unsuccessfully sought election to the Virginia General Assembly, although {{the year of the}} contest is not given. The letter continued that the defeat convinced Marshall that he could not win elected office in Fayette County and that he subsequently lobbied for the creation <b>of</b> <b>Bourbon</b> County, hoping that he might gain an office in that new county. When the county was created in 1785, he immediately applied to become the county lieutenant, but that office had apparently already been promised to someone else. Marshall applied for appointment as deputy lieutenant, and received the appointment.|$|E
50|$|One <b>of</b> <b>Bourbons</b> first moves {{as prime}} {{minister}} was to replace dArgenson, the minister of police, with Nicolas Ravot dOmbreval, who was a relative of the marquise de Prie.

5|$|As {{with many}} of his novels, Balzac {{analyzes}} the influence of history and social status in La Cousine Bette. The book takes places between 1838 and 1846, when the reign of Louis-Philippe reflected and directed {{significant changes in the}} social structure. Balzac was a legitimist favoring the House <b>of</b> <b>Bourbon,</b> and idolized Napoleon Bonaparte as a paragon of effective absolutist power. Balzac felt that French society under the House of Orléans lacked strong leadership, and was fragmented by the demands of parliament. He also believed that Catholicism provided guidance for the nation, and that its absence heralded moral decay.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} colonial period, {{under the rule}} of the House <b>of</b> <b>Bourbon,</b> the ideas of the Enlightenment on public health and social control shaped the {{development}} of Lima. New buildings undertaken during this period include a cockfighting coliseum and a bullring, the Plaza de toros de Acho, as well as the General Cemetery. The first two were built to regulate these popular activities by centralizing them at a single venue, while the cemetery {{put an end to the}} practice of burials at churches which was considered unhealthy by public authorities.|$|E
5|$|From {{the close}} of the Civil War until 1895, Kentuckians elected a series <b>of</b> <b>Bourbon</b> Democrats with Confederate sympathies as governor, {{including}} two men—James B. McCreary and Simon Bolivar Buckner—who had served in the Confederate States Army. The Democratic dominance was broken by William O'Connell Bradley, who was elected the state's first Republican governor in 1895. Bradley's election marked the beginning of thirty years of true, two-party competition for the governorship in the state. Between 1895 and 1931, five Republicans and six Democrats held the office of governor. Since 1931, however, the Republicans have been unable to preserve this level of parity, and in that period only four of the twenty elected governors have been from the Republican party, including incumbent Matt Bevin.|$|E

5|$|From {{the early}} fourteenth century, Melbourne Castle was {{mainly in the}} {{possession}} of the Earls and Dukes of Lancaster or the crown. Improvements and repairs were made, notably by John of Gaunt, and the building was in generally good condition throughout the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. John I, Duke <b>of</b> <b>Bourbon,</b> was kept at Melbourne for 19 years after his capture at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, and the castle was considered as a possible prison for Mary, Queen of Scots, although events led to her incarceration elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Glenn McCarthy was {{a modest}} oil worker who pioneered wells around what the Houston area. In 1932, he struck oil at Anahuac near the Galveston Bay. Over the next decade, he made {{dozens of other}} strikes and quickly became one of Texas' richest men. His extravagance was legendary leading to his {{becoming}} $52 million in debt in 1952 ($ in present-day terms). His love <b>of</b> <b>bourbon</b> led him to establish the WildCatter bourbon label. His excesses made him an unwilling national celebrity during the 1940s and 1950s as the media became enamored with tales of Texas oil wealth.|$|E
5|$|Historian Tracy Adams {{describes}} Isabeau as {{a talented}} diplomat who navigated court politics with ease, grace and charisma. Charles had been crowned in 1387, aged 20, attaining sole {{control of the}} monarchy. His first acts included the dismissal of his uncles and the reinstatement of the so-called Marmousets—a group of councilors to his father, Charles V—and he gave Orléans more responsibility. Some years later, after Charles' first attack of illness, tensions mounted between Orléans and the royal uncles—Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy; John, Duke of Berry; and Louis II, Duke <b>of</b> <b>Bourbon.</b> Forced to assume {{a greater role in}} maintaining peace amidst the growing power struggle, which was to persist for many years, Isabeau succeeded in her role as peacekeeper among the various court factions.|$|E

5|$|In 1735, Naples and Sicily were reconquered by King Philip V of Spain, a Bourbon, who {{installed}} {{his younger}} son, Duke Charles of Parma, as King CharlesVII of Naples and Sicily, starting a cadet {{branch of the}} house <b>of</b> <b>Bourbon.</b> In 1799 Napoleon conquered Naples, governed by FerdinandIV of Naples (later FerdinandI of the Two Sicilies) at the time. It was formed into the Parthenopaean Republic with French support. Under British pressure, especially from Lord William Bentinck, who was commander of British troops in Sicily, Naples was then handed back to Ferdinand, being forced to create a constitution for the Kingdom of Sicily. The island was under British occupation from 1806-14.|$|E
5|$|In 1866, he {{was elected}} county judge <b>of</b> <b>Bourbon</b> County. His most notable ruling in this {{capacity}} was to nullify the apprenticeship contracts of the Freedmen's Bureau in Kentucky. Hawes based this decision {{on the fact that}} the Bureau's powers extended only to states that had been part of the rebellion, which Kentucky had not. Hawes was also chosen master commissioner of the circuit court in 1866. In 1871, Hawes was mentioned as a possible candidate for governor of Kentucky. In 1876, he helped frame his party's response to the disputed Hayes–Tilden presidential election. Hawes died in Paris, Kentucky on May 25, 1877 and was interred in Paris Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The {{convention}} {{passed an}} ordinance of secession {{and established a}} provisional Confederate government for Kentucky. Burnett, William Preston of Fayette County and William E. Simms <b>of</b> <b>Bourbon</b> County were chosen as commissioners for the provisional government and were dispatched to Richmond, Virginia to negotiate with Confederate President Jefferson Davis to secure Kentucky's admission to the Confederacy. For reasons unexplained by the delegates, Dr. Luke P. Blackburn, a native Kentuckian living in Mississippi, was invited to accompany the commissioners. Despite the fact that Kentucky's elected government in Frankfort had opposed secession, the commissioners convinced Davis to recommend Kentucky's admission to the Confederacy; the Confederate Congress officially admitted Kentucky on December 10, 1861.|$|E

5|$|The lavish banquet {{was certain}} to be an affront to those {{suffering}} {{in a time of}} severe austerity, but it was reported in the L'Ami du peuple and other firebrand newspapers as nothing short of a gluttonous orgy. Worst of all, the papers all dwelt scornfully on the reputed desecration of the tricolor cockade; drunken officers were said to have stamped upon this symbol of the nation and professed their allegiance solely to the white cockade of the House <b>of</b> <b>Bourbon.</b> This embellished tale of the royal banquet became the source of intense public outrage.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{accepted}} {{an appointment to}} the circuit court <b>of</b> <b>Bourbon</b> and Clark counties in 1817. It was in this capacity that the most defining event of his career occurred. In 1822, he struck down a debt relief law {{in the case of}} Williams v. Blair on the basis that it impeded the obligation of contracts. His decision was unpopular with the legislature, who condemned the ruling and summoned Clark to appear before them and defend it. An attempt by the legislature to remove him from office fell short of the needed two-thirds majority. The following year, the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld Clark's ruling. In retaliation, the legislature attempted to abolish the court and create a new one more sympathetic to their views. This event and its aftermath became known as the Old Court-New Court controversy.|$|E
5|$|Clement XIII died {{suddenly}} on 2 February 1769, {{a day before}} {{the date of the}} consistory that he had convoked to examine the demands for the general suppression of the Society of Jesus. The various courts under the House <b>of</b> <b>Bourbon</b> and the Kingdom of Portugal (under the House of Braganza) had exerted strong pressure on the Holy See to suppress this order through almost the whole of his pontificate. In 1759 Jesuits were expelled from Portugal, in 1762 from the Kingdom of France, in 1767 from Spain and in 1768 from the Kingdom of Naples, the Kingdom of Sicily and the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza. Clement XIII strongly defended the Society (e.g. in the bull Apostolicum pascendi in 1765), but without success. In January 1769 France and Naples seized the papal territories around Avignon, Benevento and Pontecorvo to force the pope to issue a decree for the suppression of the order. The sudden death of 75-year-old Clement XIII left this difficult decision to his successor.|$|E
