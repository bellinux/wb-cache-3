5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of death (30%) amongst women in the United States, and the leading cause of chronic disease amongst them, {{affecting}} nearly 40% (Gronowski and Schindler, Tables I and IV). The onset occurs at a later age in women than in men. For instance the incidence of stroke in women under the age of 80 is less than that in men, but higher in those aged over 80. Overall the lifetime risk of stroke in women exceeds that in men. The risk <b>of</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> disease amongst those with diabetes and amongst smokers is also higher in women than in men. Many aspects <b>of</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> disease vary between women and men, including risk factors, prevalence, physiology, symptoms, response to intervention and outcome.|$|E

5|$|Aspirin {{appears to}} offer little benefit to those at {{lower risk of}} heart attack or stroke—for instance, those without a history of these events or with {{pre-existing}} disease. Some studies recommend aspirin on a case-by-case basis, while others have suggested the risks of other events, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, were enough to outweigh any potential benefit, and recommended against using aspirin for primary prevention entirely. Aspirin has also been suggested as a component of a polypill for prevention <b>of</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> disease.|$|E
5|$|Because {{consuming}} {{too much}} sodium increases risk <b>of</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> diseases, health organizations generally recommend that people reduce their dietary intake of salt. High sodium intake {{is associated with}} a greater risk of stroke, total cardiovascular disease and kidney disease. A reduction in sodium intake by 1,000mg per day may reduce cardiovascular disease by about 30 percent. In adults and children with no acute illness, a decrease in the intake of sodium from the typical high levels reduces blood pressure. A low sodium diet results in a greater improvement in blood pressure in people with hypertension.|$|E

5|$|Midazolam is {{sometimes}} used in {{neonatal intensive care}} units.

Bolus injections should be avoided due to the increased risk <b>of</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> depression, as well as neurological complications.|$|E
5|$|Some {{studies of}} FH cohorts suggest that {{additional}} risk factors are generally at play {{when a person}} develops atherosclerosis. In addition to the classic risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes, genetic {{studies have shown that}} a common abnormality in the prothrombin gene (G20210A) increases the risk <b>of</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> events in people with FH. Several studies found that a high level of lipoprotein(a) was an additional risk factor for ischemic heart disease. The risk was also found to be higher in people with a specific genotype of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).|$|E

Certain medications may be associated with birth defects and therefore may be unsuitable for women hoping to have children.|$|E

5|$|Accelerated {{deposition}} of cholesterol {{in the walls}} of arteries leads to atherosclerosis, the underlying cause <b>of</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> disease. The most common problem in FH {{is the development of}} coronary artery disease (atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries that supply the heart) at a much younger age than would be expected in the general population. This may lead to angina pectoris (chest pain or tightness on exertion) or heart attacks. Less commonly, arteries of the brain are affected; this may lead to transient ischemic attacks (brief episodes of weakness {{on one side of the}} body or inability to talk) or occasionally stroke. Peripheral artery occlusive disease (obstruction of the arteries of the legs) occurs mainly in people with FH who smoke; this can cause pain in the calf muscles during walking that resolves with rest (intermittent claudication) and problems due to a decreased blood supply to the feet (such as gangrene).|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of a number of conditions, including fever, pain, rheumatic fever, and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, and Kawasaki disease. Lower doses of aspirin have also been shown {{to reduce the risk of}} death from a heart attack, or the risk of stroke in some circumstances. There is some evidence that aspirin is effective at preventing colorectal cancer, though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear. In the United States low dose aspirin is deemed reasonable in those between 50 and 70 years old who have a more than 10% risk <b>of</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> disease and are not at an increased risk of bleeding who are otherwise healthy.|$|E

5|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}}, {{which include}} {{diseases of the}} heart, are {{the leading cause of}} death worldwide. The majority <b>of</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> disease is noncommunicable and related to lifestyle and other factors, becoming more prevalent with ageing. Heart disease is a major cause of death, accounting for an average of 30% of all deaths in 2008, globally. This rate varies from a lower 28% to a high 40% in high-income countries. Doctors that specialise in the heart are called cardiologists. Many other medical professionals are involved in treating diseases of the heart, including doctors such as general practitioners, cardiothoracic surgeons and intensivists, and allied health practitioners including physiotherapists and dieticians.|$|E
5|$|Cheney's long {{histories}} <b>of</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> {{disease and}} periodic need for urgent health care raised questions {{of whether he}} was medically fit to serve in public office. Having smoked approximately 3 packs of cigarettes per day for nearly 20 years, Cheney had his first of five heart attacks in 1978, at age 37. Subsequent attacks in 1984, 1988, 2000, and 2010 have resulted in moderate contractile dysfunction of his left ventricle. He underwent four-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting in 1988, coronary artery stenting in November 2000, urgent coronary balloon angioplasty in March 2001, and the implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in June, 2001.|$|E
5|$|Cholesterol {{levels may}} be {{determined}} {{as part of}} health screening for health insurance or occupational health, when the external physical signs such as xanthelasma, xanthoma, arcus are noticed, symptoms <b>of</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> disease develop, or a family member {{has been found to}} have FH. A pattern compatible with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa on the Fredrickson classification is typically found: raised level of total cholesterol, markedly raised level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), normal level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and normal level of triglycerides. Total cholesterol levels of 350–550 mg/dL are typical of heterozygous FH while total cholesterol levels of 650–1000 mg/dL are typical of homozygous FH. The LDL is typically above the 75th percentile, that is, 75% of the healthy population would have a lower LDL level. Cholesterol levels can be drastically higher in people with FH who are also obese.|$|E

During one visit to La Plata, he met Professor Mainetti, who pointed him {{in the direction of}} the Cleveland Clinic. Although in the beginning he had doubts about leaving his profession as a rural physician, he thought that he could make a greater contribution to the community on returning from the United States. With few resources and rudimentary English, he decided to travel to Cleveland. He first worked as a resident and later as a member of the surgical team, working with Donald B.

5|$|March 2009 {{recommendations}} from the USPSTF {{on the use}} of aspirin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease encourage men aged 45–79 and women aged 55–79 to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction in MI for men or stroke for women outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The WHI study said regular low dose (75 or 81mg) aspirin female users had a 25% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a 14% lower risk of death from any cause. Low-dose aspirin use was also associated with a trend toward lower risk <b>of</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> events, and lower aspirin doses (75 or 81mg/day) may optimize efficacy and safety for people requiring aspirin for long-term prevention.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{hypopituitarism}} is associated with an increased risk <b>of</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> disease and some also an increased risk of death of about 50% to 150% the normal population.

The studies also do not answer the question as to whether the hypopituitarism itself causes the increased mortality, or whether some of the risk is to be attributed to the treatments, some of which (such as sex hormone supplementation) have a recognized adverse effect on cardiovascular risk.|$|E
