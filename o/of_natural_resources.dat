30|$|Our {{analysis}} {{of the relationships between}} <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> dependence, public education investment, and human capital accumulation based on panel data from 31 provinces in China collected from 1999 to 2015 reveals a significant negative correlation between <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> dependence and human capital accumulation, suggesting a crowding-out effect <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> dependence on human capital. The results are consistent with our theoretical expectations. Based on our theoretical prediction, we also discuss the relationship between <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> dependence and human capital accumulation by introducing the interactive term <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> dependence and public education investment. The results show that, after the introduction of the interaction term, the coefficient <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> dependence remains significantly negative, but the interactive coefficient is significantly positive. The results indicate that public education investment could reduce the crowding-out effect <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> dependence on human capital.|$|R

5|$|Because no seismographs {{were close}} enough to the Nazko swarm zone before the {{earthquakes}} began, employees <b>of</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>Resources</b> Canada placed seismographs in the area to monitor future earthquakes in the area more clearly. An infrasound station is also being established, which is able to measure sound waves that would normally go unnoticed by human hearing. These stations can detect volcanic eruptions and the release of gas at volcanic vents, and can be used in combination with other geophysical data to monitor fluid flow within volcanoes. Employees <b>of</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>Resources</b> Canada have also visited two communities that were adjacent to the 2007–2008 earthquake swarm to renew information about the Nazko swarm, collect samples, and examine some of the more poorly studied volcanic deposits in the Nazko region. The Natural Resources Canada employees also measured carbon dioxide levels during the earthquake swarm. Carbon dioxide is usually discharged at faults in volcanically active areas and can collect in soil and under snow. Because of this, carbon dioxide concentrations can provide information on volcanic activity in the subsurface. The Nazko swarm did not cause any discernible discharge of carbon dioxide, which is normal for non-eruptive events.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Castro embraced environmentalism, campaigning against {{global warming and}} the waste <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resources,</b> and accusing the U.S. of being the world's primary polluter. In 1994 a {{ministry}} dedicated to the environment was established, and new laws established in 1997 that promoted awareness of environmental issues throughout Cuba and stressed the sustainable use <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resources.</b> By 2006, Cuba was the world's only nation which met the United Nations Development Programme's definition of sustainable development, with an ecological footprint of less than 1.8 hectares per capita and a Human Development Index of over 0.8. Castro also became a proponent of the anti-globalization movement, criticizing U.S. global hegemony and the control exerted by multinationals. Castro maintained his devout anti-apartheid beliefs, and at the July 26 celebrations in 1991, he was joined onstage by the South African political activist Nelson Mandela, recently released from prison. Mandela praised Cuba's involvement in battling South Africa in Angola and thanked Castro personally. He later attended Mandela's inauguration as President of South Africa in 1994. In 2001 he attended the Conference Against Racism in South Africa at which he lectured on the global spread of racial stereotypes through U.S. film.|$|E
