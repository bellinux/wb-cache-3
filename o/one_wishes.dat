5|$|On May 20, 2012, Perl 5.16 was released. Notable new {{features}} include {{the ability to}} specify a given version of Perl that <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> to emulate, allowing users to upgrade their version of Perl, but still run old scripts that would normally be incompatible. Perl 5.16 also updates the core to support Unicode 6.1.|$|E
5|$|These {{provisions}} {{are similar to}} those set out in section 5 of the Theft Act 1968 in relation to theft. It is clearly a right of property ownership to deal with property as <b>one</b> <b>wishes,</b> including its damage or destruction. However a person setting fire to his own house which is subject to a mortgage can be charged because the mortgagee will have a proprietary right or interest in the property. Property that is abandoned has no owner, and cannot be stolen; it follows that such property cannot be the subject of a charge of criminal damage.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{speakers}} will {{switch between}} polite and formal styles {{depending on the}} situation and the atmosphere that <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> to convey.|$|E

25|$|Thus, if <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> {{to obtain}} {{only one of}} the cross-products, one must control which {{carbonyl}} becomes the nucleophilic enol/enolate and which remains in its electrophilic carbonyl form.|$|E
25|$|This allows an {{exponentially}} growing {{variable to}} be modeled with a log-linear model. For example, if <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> to empirically estimate {{the growth rate}} from intertemporal data on x, one can linearly regress log x on t.|$|E

25|$|If <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> to {{distinguish}} an {{upper and lower}} part of the transition zone {{in the absence of a}} subsurface drainage system, one may specify in the input data a drainage system with zero intensity.|$|E
25|$|If <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> {{to simply}} make ordinal {{comparisons}} between samples (is one sample {{more or less}} varied than another), the choice of IQV is relatively less important, as they will often give the same ordering.|$|E
25|$|SodaStream {{can only}} {{carbonate}} water, one litre at a time, in the supplied bottle; the concentrates are added after carbonated water {{is removed from}} the machine. This poses a limitation if <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> to carbonate wine or fresh fruit juices.|$|E

25|$|If <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> {{to count}} free polyominoes instead, then one may check for symmetries after {{creating}} each n-omino. However, it is faster to generate symmetric polyominoes separately (by {{a variation of}} this method) and so {{determine the number of}} free polyominoes by Burnside's lemma.|$|E
25|$|In {{topology}} {{and related}} fields of mathematics, {{there are several}} restrictions that one often makes on the kinds of topological spaces that <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> to consider. Some of these restrictions are given by the separation axioms. These are sometimes called Tychonoff separation axioms, after Andrey Tychonoff.|$|E
25|$|Now when {{occasion}} offers it is a {{good thing}} to oppose our enemies and to destroy their power of attack, but lacking such opportunity it is safe to keep quiet, while if <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> to get any benefit from them it is advantageous to propitiate them.|$|E

25|$|An {{orthonormal}} {{basis for}} Minkowski space necessarily consists of one timelike and three spacelike unit vectors. If <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> {{to work with}} non-orthonormal bases {{it is possible to}} have other combinations of vectors. For example, one can easily construct a (non-orthonormal) basis consisting entirely of null vectors, called a null basis.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{is an example of}} applying a continuity correction. Suppose <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> to calculate Pr(Xnbsp&≤nbsp&8) for a binomial random variable X. If Y has a distribution given by the normal approximation, then Pr(Xnbsp&≤nbsp&8) is approximated by Pr(Ynbsp&≤nbsp&8.5). The addition of 0.5 is the continuity correction; the uncorrected normal approximation gives considerably less accurate results.|$|E
25|$|When a {{fraction}} A1, B1 and/or U1 {{in the first}} season differs from fractions are A2, B2 and/or U2 in the second season, because the irrigation regimes in the seasons differ, the program will detect that a certain rotation occurs. If <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> to avoid this, one may specify the same fractions in all seasons (A2=A1, B2=B1, U2=U1), but the crops and irrigation quantities {{may have to be}} adjusted in proportion.|$|E

25|$|Successful {{statistical}} {{practice is}} based on focused problem definition. In sampling, this includes defining the population from which our sample is drawn. A population {{can be defined as}} including all people or items with the characteristic <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> to understand. Because there is very rarely enough time or money to gather information from everyone or everything in a population, the goal becomes finding a representative sample (or subset) of that population.|$|E
25|$|The Constitution of Singapore and all {{laws are}} written in English, and interpreters are {{required}} if <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> to address the Singaporean Courts in a language other than English. English is the native tongue for only one-third of all Singaporeans, with roughly {{a quarter of all}} Singaporean Malays, a third of all Singaporean Chinese, and half of all Singaporean Indians speaking it as their native tongue. Twenty percent of Singaporeans cannot read or write in English.|$|E
25|$|For long-distance travel, {{reservation}} of a berth can be {{done for}} comfortable travel up to 120 days before the date of intended travel. Details such as the name, age and concession (if eligible) are required and are recorded on the ticket. The ticket price usually includes the base fare, which depends on the classification of the train (example: super-fast surcharge if the train is classified as a super-fast), the class in which <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> to travel and the reservation charge for overnight journeys.|$|E
