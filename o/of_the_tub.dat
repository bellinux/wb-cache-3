40|$|Building tall {{has always}} been an {{expression}} of dreams, power and technical advancement. With the greatly increasing urbanization in recent years building tall has become a more viable option for office and residential housing. <b>The</b> <b>Tubed</b> mega frame concept tries to evolve <b>the</b> stabilizing systems <b>of</b> high-rise buildings with its mega frame around the buildings perimeter, created together with a new elevator system; the Articulated Funiculator. This thesis examines <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tubed</b> mega frame compared to other structural systems. Information and background has been taken from different types of literature, analysis programs and verbally from supervisors; Fritz King and Peter Severin. Using Finite Element Method (FEM-) programs studies on previously used structural systems along with <b>the</b> <b>Tubed</b> mega frame has been made, trying to draw conclusions about its advantages and drawbacks. The examinations have been done using SAP 2000 and ETABS, both developed by CSI. <b>The</b> <b>tubed</b> mega frame shows to require a large amount of concrete compared to other systems at lower heights, because of its geometry. As the height increases it does show an increase in effectiveness and by the time it reaches 480 meters it is using less materials and still achieving greater stiffness than other systems. Since <b>the</b> geometry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tubed</b> mega frame is so flexible a conclusion is also made that the stiffness can be increased by sacrificing façade area or creating longer outriggers...|$|R

On December 16, the actions of the British cabinet reached New York: the stock {{exchange}} fell across the board, with government securities dropping by 2.5 per cent and the sterling exchange rising by two points, and an overall suspension seemed imminent. On December 20, Salmon P. Chase's broker refused to sell some of the secretary's holdings of railway stock because they were almost worthless, and informed him that the business community [...] "trust you will have allayed this excitement with England: one war at a time is enough". A run on New York banks followed the stock market troubles, with $17,000,000 being withdrawn in three weeks, and on December 30 the banks voted by 25-15 to suspend specie payments. Banks across the country soon followed them, with only those of Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky continuing to redeem in coin. This suspension left the Treasury unable to pay its suppliers, contractors or soldiers.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Tubed</b> Mega Frame {{is a new}} {{structure}} concept for high-rise buildings which is developed by Tyréns. In order to study the structural performance as well as <b>the</b> efficiency <b>of</b> this new concept, a global analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tubed</b> Mega Frame structure is performed using finite element analysis software ETABS. Besides, the lateral loads that should be applied on the structure according to different codes are also studied.

The wind loads are approximately the same while the design response spectrums vary a lot from different codes.

40|$|Today, tall {{buildings}} are generally built {{with a central}} core that transfers the loads down to the ground. The central core takes up a large part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> floor space and there is less room for <b>the</b> actual purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building, such as offices and apartments. <b>The</b> consequence <b>of</b> this is also less rental profit. At a certain height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building, the central core will not alone manage to keep the building stable. Therefore {{it needs to be}} connected with outriggers to withstand the horizontal forces. <b>The</b> <b>Tubed</b> Mega Frame system developed by Tyréns is designed without the central core and the purpose is to transfer all the loads to the ground via <b>the</b> perimeter <b>of</b> building, making <b>the</b> structure more stable since the lever arm between the loads is maximized. The system has not yet been used in reality. This thesis aimed at testing <b>the</b> efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tubed</b> Mega Frame system against conventional systems for {{tall buildings}}. Two different types <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tubed</b> Mega Frame system were evaluated; TMF Perimeter frame and TMF Mega columns. To begin with, a pre-study was carried out with <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> comparing wind deflections and eigenmodes of several conventional systems and Tubed Mega Frame systems. The buildings were modeled in the finite element software ETABS. The Core, outrigger and perimeter frame system performed best compared to the other conventional systems and was therefore chosen as the conventional system to be tested in the main study. A comparison <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Core, outrigger and perimeter frame system and eight different configurations of Tubed Mega Frame systems was carried out for several different building heights as a main study, based on the tall building 432 Park Avenue, New York. The deformations due to wind and seismic loading and eigenmodes were compared. Furthermore, the models were controlled for tension at the base and Pdelta convergence. Overall the TMF Perimeter frame systems had the smallest deflections as the building height was increased and could be increased the most without reaching tension at the base. As the top story height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> buildings was increased, <b>the</b> <b>Tubed</b> Mega Frame systems outperformed the conventional system. For the TMF Perimeter frame system it could be seen that belt walls were more efficient than cross walls, and for the TMF Mega columns the smaller the distance between the belt or cross wall levels was, the less deflection was achieved. The Core, outrigger and perimeter frame system could be increased to 859 m in height before collapse and <b>the</b> <b>Tubed</b> Mega Frame system that performed best – TMF: Perimeter frame single story belt walls – was increased to 1024 m in height until divergence was achieved...|$|R
