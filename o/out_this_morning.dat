6000|$|... "Tell Charley Welsh's {{sister that}} Charley Welsh was <b>out</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and drew his own pay," [...] {{came back the}} manager's {{familiar}} tones, crisp with asperity.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is but one}} Littlepage gal; if you {{saw them}} <b>out</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> in the carriage, you saw two York gals and parson Warren's da'ghter with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, you're <b>out</b> early, <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> gentlemen," [...] exclaimed Jason, {{affecting}} surprise. [...] "What in natur' {{has started}} you off before breakfast?" ...|$|R
60|$|It had {{not been}} Amos's purpose to venture <b>out</b> on <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and he had very good reasons for {{remaining}} at home.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Rollo. [...] "I {{have not}} taken it <b>out</b> since <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> I looked it over <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> and saw all the money, and I have not had it out since." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ken, don't call anybody, {{unless you}} want to see me disgraced. Worry got <b>out</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> before he noticed my absence from breakfast. I was scared to death." ...|$|E

60|$|Wednesday, 27th.--Set <b>out</b> early <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and {{travelled}} till noon, {{when the}} wind again drove us ashore, where we remained, in no very happy humour, all day. Mr Bain and I played the flute for pastime.|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely," [...] said Nott, meditatively. [...] "The Lascar! There's suthin' in that. That Lascar I {{fastened}} down in {{the hold}} last night unbeknownst to you, Mr. Renshaw, and let him <b>out</b> again <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> ekally unbeknownst." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{sometimes}} {{feel as though}} it were," [...] he answered. [...] "I was <b>out</b> here <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> when the wind was at play," [...] and he pointed with his whip at a fantastic snowdrift, [...] "before I saw you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have {{you heard}} the news, Francisco? My cousins are rescued! I have been <b>out</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> and have only just heard it, and I was {{on the point of}} {{starting}} to tell you." ...|$|E

60|$|Charlie Ward. The magistrates! Are they after you? Hurry on, then! Faith, they won't {{know you}} with this coat. [Looking at his rags.] It's a pity I didn't put on my old one coming <b>out</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "You're quite right," [...] said Arnold, good-humoredly. [...] "The fact is--I'm <b>out</b> of sorts, <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> My mind misgives me--I don't know why." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Tuppence thoughtfully, [...] "he didn't believe it. That's {{the curious}} part about {{speaking}} the truth. No one does believe it. I found that <b>out</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> Now let's go to lunch. How about the Savoy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just my luck!" [...] he growled, [...] "I never {{wish for}} {{anything}} without getting it. I {{did not expect}} this when I came <b>out</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and have nothing prepared. But I suppose I shall have to stand it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Exit LADY WINDERMERE R.] You seem rather <b>out</b> of temper <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> Windermere. Why {{should you}} be? Margaret and I get on charmingly together.|$|R
6000|$|... “It’s Applejack Joe,” {{said the}} policeman, as he eyed the prisoner. “We warned him <b>out</b> of town <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> What {{was he going}} to do, steal a ride?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So you {{are going}} <b>out</b> fishing <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> Harold?" [...] Mr. Welch said. [...] "I hope you will bring back a good supply, for the larder is low.

6000|$|... 'Gentlemen,' said he, 'I {{wish you}} a good day. Will you please {{to go to the}} house whence we set <b>out</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and tell my man there to send on my baggage to the [...] "Three Kings" [...] at Dresden?' ...|$|E

60|$|Mother, I {{am quite}} well. I have been <b>out</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> early, went {{down through the}} market; {{it is quite a}} curiosity--I bought some butter, tea, etc. I have had my breakfast here in my room, good tea, bread and butter, etc.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{got to keep}} going. There's a scare on. Did {{you notice}} the rooms? Half the people <b>out</b> there <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> are reporters. And if I talk they touch it up!... They didn't used to touch things up! Now they put in {{character}} touches--insulting you. Don't know what journalism's coming to. It's all Boom's doing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's just it," [...] said Miss Grover. [...] "I wish I knew. I reckon we'd {{got into}} the habit of trusting her too much, but it seemed the only way.

6000|$|... "I am {{very sorry}} to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being <b>out</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> in the rain. Young ladies {{should take care}} of themselves.--Young ladies are {{delicate}} plants. They should {{take care of their}} health and their complexion. My dear, did you change your stockings?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That HE declines. We had it <b>out</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> and I {{brought him}} round. He had come in, before I was down, {{to tell me}} he was ready--ready, I mean, to return. And he went off, after ten minutes with me, to say he wouldn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm glad of it,' said Lowten. 'We {{were keeping}} it up pretty tolerably at the Stump last night, and I'm rather <b>out</b> of sorts <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> Perker's been about that {{business}} of yours, by the bye.' ...|$|R
60|$|BERT (to TIMOTHY). Why wouldn't I {{join the}} union? I took <b>out</b> the card <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> when I see that that's {{the only way}} we'll get what's coming to us. We ain't got a chance against the {{employers}} without the union.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{was here}} just now," [...] said Meta, looking round. [...] "What a genius she is, Ethel!
