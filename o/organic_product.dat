The information about consumers’ purchasing behaviour towards <b>organic</b> <b>products</b> is not well researched in Thailand. This study investigates the important factors in consumers’ decisions to purchase <b>organic</b> <b>products</b> (such as vegetables and rice). In addition, this study aimed to estimate the mean willingness to pay (WTP) for <b>organic</b> <b>products</b> (such as Chinese kale, jasmine rice and pork) and assessed the important factors affecting the consumers’ WTP a price premium for <b>organic</b> <b>products.</b> A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data at five retail stores in Bangkok and metropolitan area. The survey data were analysed using exploratory factor analysis, logistic regression and double-bounded contingent valuation method. The results show that some respondents have been purchasing <b>organic</b> <b>products</b> but few purchased <b>organic</b> <b>products</b> on a regular basis. Respondents are more likely to purchase <b>organic</b> <b>products</b> if they are female, highly-educated, in middle-age, had knowledge about <b>organic</b> <b>products,</b> often purchase groceries at natural/health food store, concern about health and food safety, and perceive the benefits of <b>organic</b> <b>products</b> associated with quality, health and environmental friendly attributes. However, the respondents who are concern with the high price and limited availability and information about <b>organic</b> <b>products</b> are less likely to purchase <b>organic</b> <b>products.</b> The results of the WTP estimates suggest that respondents are willing to pay a premium price of 88 %, 51 % and 51 % for organic Chinese kale, organic jasmine rice and organic pork, respectively.
