25|$|Vanderbilt has {{approximately}} 139,000 living alumni, with 38 alumni clubs established worldwide. Many Vanderbilt alumni {{have gone}} on to make significant contributions in politics. Lamar Alexander (B.A. 1962) is a current U.S. Senator, former Governor of Tennessee, former U.S. Secretary of Education, and former U.S. presidential candidate; he filled the Senate seat left vacant by the retirement of Fred Thompson (J.D. 1971).

In total, Vanderbilt has graduated 12 current and former governors and 21 current and former Congressmen. Other alumni who are or have been involved in politics include former United States Supreme Court Associate Justice and former Attorney General James Clark McReynolds (B.S. 1882), Executive Vice President of the Cato Institute David Boaz (B.A. 1975),, White House Chief <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> <b>John</b> R. Steelman (M.A. 1924), Civil Rights Movement activist James Lawson (M.Div. 1960), and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Mickey Kantor (B.A. 1951). Bill Frist, a cardiothoracic surgeon and former U.S. Senate Majority Leader, is a faculty member at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Hiram Wesley Evans, who served as the Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan from 1922 to 1939, was also a Vanderbilt graduate. Floyd M. Riddick, a master's alum, served as Parliamentarian of the United States Senate. Five leaders in foreign government are alumni.

500|$|Although Kemp coaxed Bush {{to support}} a $4billion housing program that {{encouraged}} public housing tenants to buy their own apartments, the Democratic Congress allocated only $361million to the plan. In addition to opposition in Congress, Kemp fought White House Budget Director Richard Darman, who opposed Kemp's pet project HOPE (Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere). The project involved selling public housing to its tenants. Darman also opposed Kemp's proposed welfare adjustment of government offsets. HOPE was first proposed to White House chief <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> <b>John</b> Sununu in June 1989 to create enterprise zones, increase subsidies for low-income renters, expand social services for the homeless and elderly, and enact tax changes to help first-time home buyers. Sununu opposed it at first as {{did most of the}} Cabinet, but in August 1990 Sununu, at the urging of United States Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, encouraged President Bush to endorse Kemp's Economic Empowerment Task Force. [...] However, the Persian Gulf War and the budget negotiations overshadowed Kemp's new project. Darman battled Kemp and his allies such as Gingrich, James Pinkerton, and Vin Weber. The budget left him with $256million for his plan, which Kemp increased during some appropriations battles. Soon after Clayton Yeutter was appointed chief White House domestic policy advisor, Kemp's Economic Empowerment Task Force was abolished.|$|E

Former President of the United States Bill Clinton is a 1968 {{graduate}} of the School of Foreign Service, and other former world leaders include Laura Chinchilla of Costa Rica, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo of the Philippines, Saad Hariri of Lebanon, and Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador. Two SFS graduates are also currently elected presidents, Dalia Grybauskaitė of Lithuania, who completed a six-month program in 1992, and Željko Komšić, one of the tripartite Presidents of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Seven alumni serve in the United States Senate, and twenty-one in the House of Representatives. Current congressional alumni include Dick Durbin, Senate minority whip, and Steny Hoyer, House minority whip. Governor Pat Quinn of Illinois graduated from the SFS in 1971 while Governor Terry McAuliffe of Virginia received his J.D. from the Law Center in 1984. On the U.S. Supreme Court, alumni include former Associate Justice Antonin Scalia and former Chief Justice Edward Douglass White.

500|$|During the 1988 presidential election, Kennedy {{supported}} the eventual Democratic nominee, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis, {{from the start}} of the campaign. In the fall, Dukakis lost to George H. W. Bush, but Kennedy won re-election to the Senate over Republican Joseph D. Malone in the easiest race of his career. Kennedy remained a powerful force in the Senate. [...] In 1988 Kennedy co-sponsored an amendment to the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which prohibits discrimination in the rental, sale, marketing, and financing of the nation's housing; the amendment strengthened the ability of the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity to enforce the Act and expanded the protected classes to include disabled persons and families with children. After prolonged negotiations during 1989 with Bush chief <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> <b>John</b> H. Sununu and Attorney General Richard Thornburgh to secure Bush's approval, he directed passage of the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Kennedy had personal interest in the bill due to his sister Rosemary's condition and his son's lost leg, and he considered its enactment one of the most important successes of his career. In the late 1980s Kennedy and Hatch staged a prolonged battle against Senator Jesse Helms to provide funding to combat the AIDS epidemic and provide treatment for low-income people affected; this would culminate in passage of the Ryan White Care Act. In late November 1989, Kennedy traveled to see first-hand the newly fallen Berlin Wall; he spoke at John-F.-Kennedy-Platz, site of the famous [...] "Ich bin ein Berliner" [...] speech in 1963, and said [...] "Emotionally, I just wish my brother could have seen it." ...|$|E
