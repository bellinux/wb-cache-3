5|$|The UMWA used {{civil disobedience}} to attract {{attention}} to the needs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>miners.</b> The union stressed that all actions of the strike must remain peaceful. However, many miners still used violent methods during the strike. The strike gained the media's attention. People came from {{all across the country}} to support the UMWA's cause, and around 50,000 people went to southwest Virginia {{during the course of the}} strike.|$|E
5|$|With the {{discovery}} of gold in the area, gold rush brought miners to the area. In 1890, Willoughby Island in Glacier Bay {{was the scene of}} a meeting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>miners,</b> which was followed by the establishment of the Berry mining district. In the 1890s, a salt mine was established at Bartlett Cove. Fox farms and a cannery were also established; however, the cannery was abandoned in 1935.|$|E

30|$|These {{exposures}} occur {{while the}} shuttle car operator is operating downwind <b>of</b> <b>the</b> continuous <b>miner,</b> {{waiting to be}} loaded with coal. It can be seen, from Table  1, that many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exposures exceed 1.5  mg/m 3. While these exposures only occur during continuous miner cutting and loading cycles when the shuttle car is downwind <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>miner,</b> {{it can be seen}} that they may be high enough to result in overexposures.|$|R
50|$|A number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early <b>miners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{district}} {{stayed on}} as farmers. Amongst these was the McDonald family.

5|$|During the strike, Berkman {{organized}} {{demonstrations in}} New York in support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>miners.</b> In May and June, {{he and other}} anarchists led several protests against John D. Rockefeller, Jr. The protests eventually moved from New York City to Rockefeller's home in Tarrytown, New York, and resulted in the beatings, arrests, and imprisonments {{of a number of}} anarchists. The strong police response to the Tarrytown protests led to a bomb plot by several Ferrer Center anarchists.|$|E
5|$|The Earl of Warwick's estates {{included}} sawmills, quarries, brickworks and collieries {{in addition}} to agricultural holdings. Bell pits, around Clutton and High Littleton, were described {{in a survey of}} 1610. All were closed by 1836. The first deep mine in the parish of High Littleton was Mearns Coalworks which began in 1783. The Greyfield Coal Company did not start until 1833 and expanded after the opening of the Bristol and North Somerset Railway in 1847. Greyfield Colliery closed in 1911, and the railway in 1964. Maynard Terrace in Clutton was built to house some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>miners.</b>|$|E
5|$|The incline {{from there}} is not visible because of tree growth and it is {{difficult}} to get access to it without unreasonable encroachment on private property, although the OS map shows a public footpath crossing the incline about two-thirds of the way up. The remains of Brendon Hill station are Grade II listed. The remains of the summit winding house can be approached but are dangerous to enter: they are located just west of the junction of the B3224 and B3190 roads. A chapel built to attend to the spiritual needs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>miners</b> and their families still stands at the junction.|$|E

50|$|Copper {{concentrate}} is traded either via spot contracts {{or under}} long term contracts {{as an intermediate}} product in its own right. Often the smelter sells the copper metal itself on behalf <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>miner.</b> <b>The</b> <b>miner</b> is paid <b>the</b> price {{at the time that}} the smelter-refiner makes the sale, not at the price on <b>the</b> date <b>of</b> delivery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concentrate. Under a Quotational Pricing system, the price is agreed to be at a fixed date in the future, typically 90 days from time <b>of</b> delivery to <b>the</b> smelter.|$|R
5|$|The sullen {{determination}} of the strikers in the recent struggle is shown most forcibly {{by the fact that}} despite the powerful protection now here for those who desire to pursue their peaceful avocations, none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>miners</b> have returned to work, and the mine pumps are still worked by the bosses and clerks in the employ of the companies... They will be peaceable while the soldiers are here, but when they go away, they will have many a grievance to redress from their standpoint.|$|E
5|$|A celebration {{broke out}} among the miners, who broke into liquor {{warehouses}} and saloons. That night, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>miners</b> loaded a flatcar with dynamite and attempted to roll it toward the deputies' camp. It overturned short of its goal and killed a cow. Other miners wanted to blow up every mine in the region, but Johnson quickly discouraged them. Frustrated, several drunken miners then stole a work train and steamed into Victor. They {{caught up with the}} group of fleeing deputies, and a gun battle broke out. One deputy and one miner died, a man on each side was wounded, and six strikers were captured by the deputies. The miners subsequently captured three officials of the Strong mine who had been present when the shafthouse was blown up. A formal prisoner exchange later freed all prisoners on both sides.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, the sheriff of St. George, {{accompanied}} by a posse of 30 men, arrested 25 members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Miners</b> Union, including Matthew O'Loughlin. As Silver Reef's jail {{was too small to}} hold all 25 prisoners, most of them were jailed in the Rice Building. The Rice Building could not hold all of the prisoners, so a line was drawn around the building, and anyone who crossed the line was threatened with shooting. The Miners Union members were transferred to Beaver, where they were tried for riot, conspiracy, and false imprisonment. Thirteen of the members were sentenced to imprisonment; three were bailed out, while ten were sent to the Utah Territorial Penitentiary. Matthew O'Loughlin was sentenced to twenty days in prison and was charged a $75 fine.|$|E

5|$|Although most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>miners</b> left, {{either to}} return home or settle elsewhere, some stayed {{to work in the}} {{ranching}} and logging industries that became the economic mainstay of the Trinity River area. Some also continued to search for gold long after the major deposits were gone; even today, recreational gold panning remains a popular activity along the Trinity. One Mr. Jorstad who had been mining in the Trinity River country since the 1930s, continued to live in a small cabin at Pfeiffer Flat on the North Fork until his death in 1989. Jorstad's cabin was an important rest stop for miners, hunters, hikers and fishermen along the North Fork for many years; it remains as a historical site maintained by the Forest Service.|$|E
5|$|During {{the crisis}} of the Utah War in 1857, Brigham Young {{recalled}} Mormon colonists from the western areas of the proposed State of Deseret to the core area of Mormon settlement south of the Great Salt Lake. Alexander heeded the call, leaving his wife and son in Western Utah. With Alexander gone, Bowers and Robert left the abandoned settlement of Franktown for a small mining camp called Johntown in Gold Canyon near present-day Virginia City, Nevada. Bowers opened a boardinghouse and began taking care <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>miners.</b> When the threat of war passed, Alexander returned to Western Utah and settled in Johntown, but he did not wish to pursue the life of a Washoe miner. In the fall of 1858 he returned to Salt Lake City where he remained a prominent member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Bowers and Robert remained in Johntown.|$|E
5|$|Haywood {{observed}} {{how the government}} frequently took the side of business to defeat the tactics and the aspirations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>miners.</b> During an 1899 organizing drive in Coeur d'Alene, with pay cuts as a motivating issue, the company hired spies and then fired organizers and pro-union miners. Some frustrated miners responded with violence and when two men were killed, martial law was declared. As they had done in a strike in Coeur d'Alene seven years earlier, soldiers acted as strike breakers. They rounded up hundreds of union members without formal charges {{and put them in}} a filthy, vermin-infested warehouse without sanitation services for a year. They were so crowded that the soldiers locked the overflow of prisoners in boxcars. One local union leader was imprisoned for 17 years.|$|E

50|$|ENRC {{annual report}} {{released}} on 30 April said that UK authorities are investigating whether ENRC breached Britain's rules for listed companies, specifically with acquisitions made in <b>the</b> Democratic Republic <b>of</b> Congo and a 2012 sale of railway line repair company Zhol Zhondeushi {{to a company}} connected to <b>the</b> family <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>miner's</b> co-founders.|$|R
50|$|By the 18th century {{there were}} many {{thousands}} of lead mines, all worked individually. Defoe gives an eye-witness account of a lead <b>miner's</b> family and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>miner</b> himself at work. At this time, the London Lead Company was formed, which provided the finance to dig deeper mines, with drainage channels, called soughs, and introduce Newcomen steam engine pumps.|$|R
5|$|Ida {{insisted that}} McKinley {{continue}} his increasingly successful career {{in law and}} politics. He attended the state Republican convention that nominated Hayes for a third term as governor in 1875, and campaigned again for his old friend in the election that fall. The next year, McKinley undertook a high-profile case defending a group of coal miners arrested for rioting after a clash with strikebreakers. Lynch, McKinley's opponent in the 1871 election, and his partner, William R. Day, were the opposing counsel, and the mine owners included Mark Hanna, a Cleveland businessman. Taking the case pro bono, he was successful in getting all but one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>miners</b> acquitted. The case raised McKinley's standing among laborers, {{a crucial part of}} the Stark County electorate, and also introduced him to Hanna, who would become his strongest backer in years to come.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} after the strike, the world's silver market dropped, causing the {{foreclosure}} {{of many of the}} mines. To compensate for the drop in prices, the mines' stockholders reduced the wages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>miners.</b> Instead of striking again, the miners accepted this. In addition, the miners inadvertently dug below the water table, and the mine shafts began filling with water faster than it could be pumped out. By 1884, most of the mines were idle or closed; the last was officially closed in 1891, although lessees of the mines continued to operate them past that year. Many merchants went bankrupt and left town. The Silver Reef mines produced about $8million worth of silver ore. Between 1891 and 1901, another $250,000 worth was mined. Several people attempted to restart mining operations in 1898, 1909, 1916, and 1950, but none of these attempts were successful. After Silver Reef's mines were closed, many of the buildings were purchased for their lumber and building stone. One buyer dismantled the building he bought and discovered $10,000 in gold coins. News of the find spread quickly, and most of the buildings in Silver Reef were demolished in hopes of discovering more gold, but none was found.|$|E
5|$|Silver Reef's {{residents}} {{rebuilt the}} businesses {{that had been}} destroyed, but the town soon began to decline. In 1881, the Stormont Mining Company and the Barbee & Walker Mining Company had to decrease wages from $4 per day to $3.50 per day in all of their mines except the Savage mine (a Stormont property). In response to the decrease in wages, the Silver Reef Miners Union was formed. In February 1881, union members began talking about striking the mines, and as word of this potential strike spread, the Stormont Mining Company discharged those of its miners who were part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Miners</b> Union. In response, the discharged union members escorted the company's superintendent, Washington Allen, out of Silver Reef. Allen immediately went to the Second District Court in Beaver and {{filed a lawsuit against}} the union members. Before they went to court, the union members held a meeting and decided to shut down the Savage mine. Led by Matthew O'Loughlin, the president of the Silver Reef Miners Union, they walked through Silver Reef in rows of two, and, upon arriving at the Savage mine, O'Loughlin and nine other men went into the hoisting works and ordered the engineer on duty to shut down the pumps that kept water from the water table out of the mine. After the pumps were shut down, the group of ten went into the Savage mine and ordered everyone out.|$|E
30|$|In general, the {{evacuation}} design should fully consider both <b>the</b> models <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>miner</b> behaviors involved in fires and <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire smoke movement. In addition, the psychology and behavior patterns, such as phototactic behavior, conformity behavior, and homing behavior, should be fully considered during <b>the</b> evacuation <b>of</b> coal mine fires. Thus <b>the</b> probability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> successful evacuation could be achieved.|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of the First World War, the {{economic}} prospects in South Wales were good. Although production fell after the 1913 high, demand was still strong enough to push the coalfields to their limit. In February 1917 coal mining came under government control and demand increased as the war intensified, ensuring a market for sufficient supplies of coal. After the war the picture began to change. Initially the British coal industry was buoyed by a series of fortuitous economic events, such as the American coal miners' strike, and by 1924, unemployment for miners was below the national average. But the belief that the mining industry would experience a permanent demand for coal was shattered by the Depression, and the Rhondda experienced a massive upturn in unemployment. The situation worsened in 1926 when, in response to coalowners reducing pay and lengthening working hours of miners, the TUC called a general strike in defence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>miners</b> who had been locked out following A.J. Cook's call 'not a penny off the pay, not a minute on the day'. The TUC called off the strike just nine days later, without resolving the miners' cut in wages. The miners disagreed and stayed on strike for a further seven months until they were starved into surrendering. The Rhondda saw many schemes set up by miners to aid their plight, such as soup kitchens and fêtes and 'joy' days to support them; while in Maerdy the local miners set up a rationing system. By the time the miners returned to work there was little desire for further action through strikes, which saw a decline in the popularity of 'The Fed' and greater emphasis on solving problems through political and parliamentary means.|$|E
