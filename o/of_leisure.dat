5|$|Studies <b>of</b> <b>leisure</b> have {{determined}} that observable patterns cannot be easily explained by socioeconomic variables such as income, occupation or education.

50|$|Among {{the lower}} social-classes, a man’s {{reputation}} as a diligent, efficient, and productive worker is the highest form of pecuniary emulation <b>of</b> the <b>leisure</b> class available to him in society. Yet, among the social strata <b>of</b> the <b>leisure</b> class, manual labour {{is perceived as a}} sign of social and economic weakness; thus, the defining, social characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>leisure</b> class are the “exemption from useful employment” and the practice <b>of</b> conspicuous <b>leisure</b> as a “non-productive consumption of time”.|$|R

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, type <b>of</b> <b>leisure</b> {{activity}} is substantially {{influenced by the}} individual's immediate situation—whether he has a family, whether there are recreational facilities nearby, and age. Early family influences, particularly involving the more social leisure activities, can be profound. The type <b>of</b> <b>leisure</b> activity also depends on the individual's current place in the life cycle.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{emphasis}} in studies <b>of</b> <b>leisure</b> {{has shifted from}} the work-leisure relation, particularly in well-researched majorities, to study of minorities and the relation between leisure and culture. Marshall Gordon noted {{that there are two}} approaches in the study of leisure: formal and historical-theoretical. The formal approach focuses on empirical questions, such as the shifting <b>of</b> <b>leisure</b> patterns over an individual's life cycle, the relation between leisure and work, and specific forms <b>of</b> <b>leisure</b> (such as the sociology of sport). The historical-theoretical approach studies the relation between leisure and social change, often from structural-functionalist and neo-Marxist perspectives. Sheila Scraton provided a different analysis, comparing North American and British studies. The British approaches focus on input from pluralism, critical Marxism, and feminism; the American approaches concentrate on the social-psychological tradition.|$|E

50|$|The {{clergy and}} the women who are members <b>of</b> the <b>leisure</b> class {{function}} as objects <b>of</b> vicarious <b>leisure,</b> thus, it is morally impossible for them to work and productively contribute to society. As such, maintaining a high social-class is more important for a woman <b>of</b> the <b>leisure</b> class, than it is for a man <b>of</b> the <b>leisure</b> class. Women, therefore, are the greatest indicators of a man’s socio-economic standing in his respective community. In a consumer society, how a woman spends her time and what activities she does with her time communicate the social standing of her husband, her family, and her social class.|$|R

5|$|Sociology <b>of</b> <b>leisure</b> or leisure {{sociology}} is {{the study}} of how humans organize their free time. Leisure includes a broad array of activities, such as sport, tourism, and the playing of games. The sociology <b>of</b> <b>leisure</b> is closely tied to the sociology of work, as each explores a different side of the work-leisure relationship. More recent studies in the field move away from the work-leisure relationship and focus on the relation between leisure and culture.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{findings}} in sociological studies <b>of</b> <b>leisure</b> are illustrated by John Robinson's late-1970s study of American leisure. Robinson found that Americans, on average, have four hours <b>of</b> <b>leisure</b> time each weekday, {{and more on}} weekends—six hours on Saturdays, almost eight on Sundays. Amount <b>of</b> <b>leisure</b> time diminishes with age, work, marriage, and children. However, the amount of free time does not significantly depend on an individual's wealth. People desire less free time if they are uncertain of their economic future, or if their job is their central interest. During {{the second half of}} the twentieth century, watching television became a major leisure activity, causing a substantial decrease in the time dedicated to other activities; in the early 1970s the average American had 4 hours <b>of</b> <b>leisure</b> per day, and spent 1.5 of them watching television. Shared leisure activities increase marital satisfaction.|$|E

5|$|Apart from a {{definition}} <b>of</b> <b>leisure,</b> {{there are other}} questions of theoretical concern to the sociologist <b>of</b> <b>leisure.</b> For example, quantifying the results is difficult, as time-budget studies have noted that a given amount of time (for example, an hour) may have different values, depending on when it occurs—within a day, a week, or a year. Finally, as with many other fields of inquiry in the social sciences, {{the study of the}} sociology <b>of</b> <b>leisure</b> is hampered by the lack of reliable data for comparative longitudinal studies, as there was little to no standardized data-gathering on leisure throughout most of human history. The lack of longitudinal studies has been remedied in the last few decades by recurring national surveys such as the General Household Survey in the United Kingdom (ongoing since 1971). In addition to surveys, an increasing number of studies have been focusing on qualitative methods of research (interviews).|$|E
