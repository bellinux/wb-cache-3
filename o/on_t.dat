40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{reported}} new evidence consistent with the hypothesis that reactivating a memory by re-exposure to a training context destabilizes the memory and induces “reconsolidation. ” In the present experiments, rats' memory for inhibitory avoidance (IA) training was tested 6 h (Test 1), 2 d (Test 2), and 6 d (Test 3) after training. <b>On</b> <b>Test</b> 1 the rats were either removed from the shock compartment immediately after entry or retained in the shock context for 200 sec, and intrahippocampal infusions of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (75 μg/side) were administered immediately after the test. Anisomycin infusions administered after Test 1 impaired IA performance <b>on</b> <b>Test</b> 2 in animals given the brief re-exposure, but impaired extinction in animals exposed to the context for 200 sec. Rats with anisomycin-induced retention impairment <b>on</b> <b>Test</b> 2 demonstrated spontaneous recovery of retention performance <b>on</b> <b>Test</b> 3, whereas rats showing extinction <b>on</b> <b>Test</b> 2 showed further extinction <b>on</b> <b>Test</b> 3. The findings indicate that post-retrieval administration of anisomycin impairs subsequent retention performance only {{in the absence of}} extinction and that this impairment is temporary...|$|R

25|$|Then {{there is}} a variety Av and a family of degree 0 line bundles P, the Poincaré bundle, parametrised by Av such that a family L <b>on</b> <b>T</b> is {{associated}} a unique morphism f: T → Av so that L is isomorphic to the pullback of P along the morphism 1A×f: A×T → A×Av. Applying this to the case when T is a point, {{we see that the}} points of Av correspond to line bundles of degree 0 on A, so {{there is a}} natural group operation on Av given by tensor product of line bundles, which makes it into an abelian variety.|$|E
25|$|Proof. Consider a graph <b>on</b> <b>t</b> {{vertices}} and colour {{its edges}} with c colours. Now 'go colour-blind' and pretend that c−1 and c {{are the same}} colour. Thus the graph is now (c−1)-coloured. By the inductive hypothesis, it contains either a Kni mono-chromatically coloured with colour i for some 1 ≤ i ≤ c−2 or a K'R(n'c − 1, n'c)-coloured in the 'blurred colour'. In the former case we are finished. In the latter case, we recover our sight again and see from the definition of R(n'c−1, n'c) we must have either a (c−1)-monochrome K'n'c−1 or a c-monochrome K'n'c. In either case the proof is complete.|$|E

25|$|One ligand-receptor {{interaction}} {{under investigation}} is {{the interaction between}} the transmembrane programmed cell death 1 protein (PDCD1, PD-1; also known as CD279) and its ligand, PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1, CD274). PD-L1 on the cell surface binds to PD1 on an immune cell surface, which inhibits immune cell activity. Among PD-L1 functions is a key regulatory role <b>on</b> <b>T</b> cell activities. It appears that (cancer-mediated) upregulation of PD-L1 on the cell surface may inhibit T cells that might otherwise attack. PD-L1 on cancer cells also inhibits FAS- and interferon-dependent apoptosis, protecting cells from cytotoxic molecules produced by T cells. Antibodies that bind to either PD-1 or PD-L1 and therefore block the interaction may allow the T-cells to attack the tumor.|$|E

The percentage of circulating γδ-CD3+ T cells and αβ-CD3+ T cells did not change significantly in subjects who took Juice Plus; however, {{at the end of}} the supplementation period, subjects taking the supplement had a significantly higher percentage of γδ-CD3+ T cells (7.2%) as compared with placebo (5.4%). IFN-γ produced by stimulated lymphocytes in vitro was reduced in the Juice Plus (68%) and placebo groups (41%), but the reduction was statistically significant only in the Juice Plus group. The levels of other cytokines (IL-4, IL-6, TGF-β) were unchanged and Juice Plus had no significant effect on the incidence and symptoms of illness or on EBV antibody titers.|$|E

25|$|The Eagles offense {{took the}} field for the first time, with the ball spotted at their own 29-yard line. After an {{incomplete}} pass, QB Michael Vick threw a pass intended for WR DeSean Jackson, but it was picked off by CB Corey Webster who returned it to the Philadelphia 42-yard line. The Giants were unable to capitalize on the turnover, as LB Moise Fokou sacked QB Eli Manning putting them out of field goal range and forcing them to punt. After the Eagles failed to get anything going on the ensuing drive, the Giants put together a 71-yard scoring drive that ended with Manning finding WR Mario Manningham for a 35-yard touchdown pass to put the Giants on the board, leading 7–0. Near the end of the quarter S Quintin Mikell picked off Manning's pass to WR Derek Hagan and ran it back to the Giants 45-yard line. The final play of the first quarter resulted in a run by Vick for 11 yards and a personal foul called <b>on</b> <b>T</b> Jonathan Goff which moved the ball to the Giants' 19-yard line.|$|E

500|$|When {{foraging}} intensity increases, individuals become shorter each {{growing season}} {{due to the}} reduction in energy reserves from less photosynthetic production. One study determined that the ideal deer density in northeastern Illinois, based <b>on</b> <b>T.</b> grandiflorum {{as an indicator of}} overall understory health, is 4 to 6 animals per square kilometer. This is based on a 12 to 14cm stem height as an acceptable healthy height. [...] In practice, deer densities as high as 30 deer per square kilometers are known to occur in restricted or fractured habitat where natural control mechanisms (that is, predators like wolves) are lacking. Such densities, if maintained over more than a few years, can be very damaging to the understory and lead to extinction of some local understory plant populations.|$|E
500|$|Between 1998 and 1999 a {{renovation}} {{that was}} [...] "one {{of the most}} extensive changes in the homestead's history" [...] set out to [...] "restore the grounds around the house to exactly {{the way it was}} when Priestley lived" [...] there. This involved reconstructing exact replicas of the original carriage barn, hog sties, horse stalls, gardens, fences, and even the privy. These structures were based <b>on</b> <b>T.</b> Lambourne's drawings of the house and grounds that had been discovered in 1983, other records, and excavations. [...] Priestley left no written description of his laboratory, but much is known of his experiments and late-18th-century laboratories. Extensive research on the laboratory within the house was completed in 1996, including excavations that revealed two underground ovens, as well as evidence of a primitive fume hood. The 1998 renovations also included work to restore the laboratory to a condition as close to its original state as possible.|$|E
500|$|Complete {{stimulation}} of T helper cells requires the B7 molecule {{present on the}} antigen presenting cell to bind with CD28 molecule present on the T cell surface (in close proximity with the T cell receptor). Likewise, a second interaction between the CD40 ligand or CD154 (CD40L) present <b>on</b> <b>T</b> cell surface and CD40 present on B cell surface, is also necessary. The same interactions that stimulate the T helper cell also stimulate the B cell, hence the term costimulation. The entire mechanism ensures that an activated T cell only stimulates a B cell that recognizes the antigen containing the same epitope as recognized by the T cell receptor of the [...] "costimulating" [...] T helper cell. The B cell gets stimulated, apart from the direct costimulation, by certain growth factors, viz., interleukins 2, 4, 5, and 6 in a paracrine fashion. These factors are usually produced by the newly activated T helper cell. However, this activation occurs only after the B cell receptor present on a memory or a naive B cell itself would have bound to the corresponding epitope, without which the initiating steps of phagocytosis and antigen processing would not have occurred.|$|E
