5|$|Jones had {{previously}} codirected AJ Goes to France, a 2006 live-action independent film that also has Thompson {{as the leading}} actor. It was produced as an assignment for Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, where Jones majored in film.

For AJ's Infinite Summer, Jones was inspired by his hometown, {{as well as the}} comics he drew that featured AJ and his <b>other</b> <b>friends,</b> Danny Davy and Morgan. Additionally, the character of Peter is based on Greg Carlson, Jones' professor from Concordia and also a film director and a critic for the High Plains Reader. Secret Cities, a Fargo-based band in which Jones' friends play, provided the score for the pilot. Jones found it excellent that both his friends and his friend's band were allowed by the network to do work for the pilot.|$|E
