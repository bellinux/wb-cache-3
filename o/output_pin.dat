25|$|Output {{sink current}}: The output sink current is the maximum current allowed {{to sink into}} the output stage. Some {{manufacturers}} show the output voltage vs. the output sink current plot, which gives {{an idea of the}} output voltage when it is sinking current from another source into the <b>output</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mirror-image {{insertion}} protection {{means that}} a regulator is designed for use when a voltage, usually not higher than the maximum input voltage of the regulator, is applied to its <b>output</b> <b>pin</b> while its input terminal is at a low voltage, volt-free or grounded. Some regulators can continuously withstand this situation. Others might only manage it for a limited time such as 60 seconds (usually specified in the data sheet). For instance, this situation can occur when a three terminal regulator is incorrectly mounted on a PCB, with the output terminal connected to the unregulated DC input and the input connected to the load. Mirror-image insertion protection is also important when a regulator circuit is used in battery charging circuits, when external power fails or is not turned on and the output terminal remains at battery voltage.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the above}} example, {{from left to}} right, the graph {{contains}} a source filter to read an MP3 file, stream splitter and decoder filters to parse and decode the audio, and a rendering filter to play the raw audio samples. Each filter has one or more pins {{that can be used}} to connect that filter to other filters. Every pin functions either as an output or input source for data to flow from one filter to another. Depending on the filter, data is either [...] "pulled" [...] from an input pin or [...] "pushed" [...] to an <b>output</b> <b>pin</b> in order to transfer data between filters. Each pin can only connect to one other pin and they have to agree on what kind of data they are sending.|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} an experimental {{analysis of the}} impact of gate and device-level faults in the processor of a Bendix BDX- 930 flight control system. Via mixed mode simulation, faults were injected at the gate (stuck-at) and at the transistor levels and, their propagation through the chip to the <b>output</b> <b>pins</b> was measured. The results show that there is little correspondence between a stuck-at and a device-level fault model, as far as error activity or detection within a functional unit is concerned. In so far as error activity outside the injected unit and at the <b>output</b> <b>pins</b> are concerned, the stuck-at and device models track each other. The stuck-at model, however, overestimates, by over 100 percent, the probability of fault propagation to the <b>output</b> <b>pins.</b> An evaluation of the Mean Error Durations and the Mean Time Between Errors at the <b>output</b> <b>pins</b> shows that the stuck-at model significantly underestimates (by 62 percent) the impact of an internal chip fault on the <b>output</b> <b>pins.</b> Finally, the study also quantifies the impact of device fault by location, both internally and at the <b>output</b> <b>pins...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental {{analysis of the}} impact of gate and device-level faults in the processor of a flight control system. Via mixed mode simulation faults were injected both at the gate (stuck-at) and at the transistor levels, and their propagation through the chip to the <b>output</b> <b>pins</b> was measured. The results show that there is little correspondence between a stuck-at and a device-level fault model insofar as error activity or detection within a functional unit is concerned. Insofar as error activity outside the injected unit and at the <b>output</b> <b>pins</b> are concerned, the stuck-at and device models track each other, although the stuck-at model overestimates, by over one hundred percent, the probability of fault propagation to the <b>output</b> <b>pins.</b> The stuck-at model significantly underestimates the impact of an internal chip fault on the <b>output</b> <b>pins...</b>|$|R

5000|$|When {{an object}} executes, {{it uses the}} input pin's value to perform an operation. When it finishes, the result {{is placed on the}} <b>output</b> <b>pin.</b> The <b>output</b> <b>pin</b> value placed is then {{propagated}} to any input pins that are connected to it.|$|E

50|$|The {{cycloidal}} disc has {{holes that}} are {{slightly larger than}} the <b>output</b> roller <b>pins</b> that go inside them. The <b>output</b> <b>pins</b> will move around in the holes to achieve steady rotation of the output shaft from the wobbling movement of the cycloidal disc.|$|R

50|$|Uni-directional - All input pins are {{dedicated}} to one voltage domain, all <b>output</b> <b>pins</b> {{are dedicated}} to the other. Bi-directional with Dedicated Ports - Each voltage domain has both input and <b>output</b> <b>pins,</b> but the data direction of a pin does not change. Bi-directional with External direction indicator - When an external signal is changed, inputs become outputs and vice versa. Bi-directional, auto-sensing - A pair of I/O spanning voltage domains can act as either inputs or outputs depending on external stimulus {{without the need for}} a dedicated direction control pin.|$|R
50|$|The pins on {{the left}} side of an object are called input pins, whereas the pins on the right are output pins. Two objects, A and B, are {{connected}} if the <b>output</b> <b>pin</b> of object A is connected to object B’s input pin. Several connection lines can emanate from a single <b>output</b> <b>pin,</b> but at most one connection line can be attached to an input pin. All data input pins and execute pins must be connected, whereas control pins and output pins can be left unconnected.|$|E
5000|$|In this context, {{the blocks}} are logic gates such as NAND, OR, AND, etc. Although in reality these gates will be {{composed}} of transistors, a semi-custom engineer will only {{be aware of the}} delay information from input pin to <b>output</b> <b>pin,</b> called a timing arc. The 2D table represents information about the variability of the gate's delay with respect to the two independent variables, usually the rate of change of the signal at the input and the load at the <b>output</b> <b>pin.</b> These two variable are called slew and load in design parlance.|$|E

50|$|In {{bistable}} mode, the 555 timer {{acts as a}} basic flip-flop. The {{trigger and}} reset inputs (pins 2 and 4 respectively on a 555) are held high via pull-up resistors while the threshold input (pin 6) is simply floating. Thus configured, pulling the trigger momentarily to ground acts as a 'set' and transitions the <b>output</b> <b>pin</b> (pin 3) to VCC (high state). Pulling the reset input to ground acts as a 'reset' and transitions the <b>output</b> <b>pin</b> to ground (low state). No timing capacitors are required in a bistable configuration. Pin 7 (discharge) is left unconnected, or {{may be used as}} an open-collector output.|$|E

5000|$|An error pin {{is used to}} trap errors when {{an object}} execute. If it is present, no error dialog will be shown. When an error occurs, the error pin propagates instead of data output pins, {{followed}} by the sequence <b>output</b> <b>pin</b> (if connected).|$|E

50|$|An {{action may}} receive inputs {{in the form}} of control flows and object flows (the latter via input pins) and passes the results of its {{processing}} or transformations to one or more outgoing control flows or object flows (the latter via <b>output</b> <b>pins)</b> and onto downstream nodes.|$|R

50|$|In {{packages}} with a heat-dissipating mounting tab, such as TO-220, the tab {{is connected}} internally to the <b>output</b> <b>pin</b> which {{may make it}} necessary to electrically isolate the tab or the heat sink {{from other parts of}} the application circuit.

50|$|The {{advantage}} {{of using a}} ROM {{in this way is}} that any conceivable function of all possible combinations of the m inputs can be made to appear at any of the n outputs, making this the most general-purpose combinational logic device available for m input <b>pins</b> and n <b>output</b> <b>pins.</b>|$|R
