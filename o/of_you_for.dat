5|$|It {{finished}} 1994 as {{the fourth}} best-selling US Latin album and the best-selling regional Mexican album. In 1995, it ranked second to Dreaming <b>of</b> <b>You</b> <b>for</b> the best-selling Latin album, but was the best-selling regional Mexican recording. Amor Prohibido remained the best-selling regional Mexican album in 1996, while the record became the ninth best-selling Latin album of that year. It also ranked {{as the second}} best-selling catalog Latin album of 1997, while in 1998 it placed third. Billboards revised catalog criteria made it ineligible for the Top Latin Albums chart on January 18, 1997. It {{was removed from the}} list and began charting on the newly formed Latin Catalog Albums chart positioned at number two. Since 1997, the album has spent 13 nonconsecutive weeks at number one on the Top Latin Catalog Albums chart including three weeks in 2010. Following another revision to its Top Latin Albums chart, Billboard removed its two decade-long ban of catalog albums in its chart beginning with the February 11, 2017 list; Amor Prohibido re-entered the Top Latin Albums and Regional Mexican Albums chart after 20 years. Before its revision, Nielsen SoundScan reported that Amor Prohibido was the ninth best-selling Latin record of 2016. After its revision, Amor Prohibido reclaimed the number one position on the Regional Mexican Albums chart in May 2017. In November 1994, the album had sold 200,000 units in the US. A report showed the singer was one of the top-selling acts in Mexico. It became the second Tejano album to reach year-end sales of 500,000 copies. This had only been accomplished by La Mafia previously. Despite this, Nielsen Soundscan reported that the recording actually sold 184,000 units by April 1995. According to Behar, the sales figures Nielsen SoundScan provided did not include sales in small shops specializing in Latin music. That May, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album gold, for shipments of 500,000 units. Within three weeks, it was certified platinum for increments of one million units. Amor Prohibido became the first Tejano record to receive a platinum certification. By June 1995, it had sold 1.5 million units in the US, of which 100,000 were sold in Puerto Rico alone. As of February 2010, the album has been certified double diamond (Latin), denoting shipments of two million units. It is tied at second, behind her album Dreaming <b>of</b> <b>You,</b> <b>for</b> the best-selling Latin album of all-time in the US with 2.5 million copies sold worldwide. The recording has been ranked as the best-selling Tejano album of the 1990s, and the best-selling Tejano album of all-time.|$|E
5|$|The {{recording}} finished as the forty-fourth {{album of}} the Billboard 200 of 1995 and finished at number 123 on the Billboard 200 albums of 1996. Two years after Selena's murder, Dreaming of You and Siempre Selena (1996) occupied {{the third and fourth}} slots respectively on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart. Dreaming of You sold 420,500 copies between 1997 and 1999, and sold 190,000 units in 1997 alone. The biopic Selena (1997) contributed to a 65% increase of sales for Dreaming <b>of</b> <b>You</b> <b>for</b> that year. Dreaming of You sold half a million copies in Texas. Some Texas retailers criticized sale figures for the state because the album had sold poorly at their music stores. By December 1995, Dreaming of You had sold two million copies in the U.S. and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), signifying shipments of two million copies. Within ten months of its release, the album was nearing triple-platinum status; it was eventually certified 35×platinum (Latin field) by the RIAA, denoting shipment of 3.5 million units. It remains the best-selling Latin album of all-time in the U.S. with five million copies sold worldwide as of January 2015. A percentage of the proceeds from the album's sales was donated to the Selena Scholarship Fund.|$|E

500|$|After 48 {{weeks at}} {{number one on}} the US Billboard Regional Mexican Albums chart, Amor Prohibido was {{displaced}} by Bronco's Rompiendo Barreras. Before Selena was murdered in March 1995, the album remained in the top five on the Top Latin Albums chart for 53 consecutive weeks. Album sales in the four weeks preceding her death were slightly above 2,000 units a week. In the week immediately before her death, Amor Prohibido sold 1,700 units. Media attention had helped increased sales of Amor Prohibido as well as her back catalogue. It was the most requested album by people in music stores looking for her work in the hours immediately after her death. An Austin, Texas music retailer expressed how Amor Prohibido sold more units in the first month following her death [...] "than it did the entire year it was out." [...] In McAllen, Texas, music shops reported that people bought the singer's earlier works than Amor Prohibido, citing that [...] "most fans already have her latest [...] ".

Amor Prohibido and her 1992 studio album Entre a Mi Mundo, rose 1,250% in sales in the eight weeks following her murder, making it the third largest-percentage gains following a musician's death as of June 2010, behind American singers Alex Chilton and Michael Jackson's percentage increase following their deaths. The album helped increase local record shops in Texas who were [...] "selling more than when [...] was alive". Amor Prohibido remained at number one on the Top Latin Albums chart for 16 weeks following her death until the planned release of her crossover album Dreaming of You replaced it on August 5. The album remained behind Dreaming <b>of</b> <b>You</b> <b>for</b> seven weeks.

2500|$|Mormons see the {{tendency}} to dismiss the possibility that God could call modern prophets as similar to the attitude {{of those in the}} Bible who rejected the prophets and/or apostles of their day. As demonstrated by the Jews in the time of Jesus, it is often much less challenging to accept prophets of prior ages, rather than a contemporary prophet. Granted, the work of a prophet has always been to dispel false beliefs and warn against behaviors that are contrary to God's will, which inevitably creates friction when viewed as a threat to firmly entrenched traditions and mindsets. The sense of change in the message of Christ and the apostles led many to regard them as false prophets. Christ himself warned against false prophets, teaching that the way to distinguish between a true and a false prophet was [...] "by their fruits" [...] (Matt 7:15-20); however, the perceived threat to tradition was often a strong enough deterrent to cause the witnesses of good fruits (such as powerful sermons or miraculous healings) to dismiss them as the work of the devil (Matt 12:24). After Christ ordained his apostles, he warned them of the extreme opposition they would encounter for these reasons, telling them, [...] "ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake" [...] (Matt 10:16-23). Christ also said, “Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well <b>of</b> <b>you!</b> <b>For</b> so did their fathers to the false prophets," [...] thus illustrating that opposition will naturally accompany a true prophet if they are doing their job correctly (Luke 6:22-26).|$|E
