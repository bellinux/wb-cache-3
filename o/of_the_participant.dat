25|$|The results {{indicated}} that when the decision is meaningful to the person deciding value, the likely rating is based {{on his or her}} attitudes (positive, neutral, or negative) towards the name and towards the painting in question. The participants also were asked to rate some of the objects twice and believed that, at session's end, they would receive two of the paintings they had positively rated. The {{results indicated}} a great increase in the positive attitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> towards the liked pair of things, whilst also increasing the negative attitude towards the disliked pair of things. The double-ratings of pairs of things, towards which the rating participant had a neutral attitude, showed no changes during the rating period. Therefore, the existing attitudes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> were reinforced during the rating period, and the participants suffered cognitive dissonance when confronted by a liked-name paired with a disliked-painting.|$|E
25|$|Influenzanet is a syndromic {{surveillance}} {{system based on}} voluntary reports of symptoms via the internet. Residents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> countries are invited to provide regular reports on {{the presence or absence}} of flu related symptoms. The system has been in place and running since 2003 in the Netherlands and Belgium. The success of this first initiative led to the implementation of Gripenet in Portugal in 2005 followed by Italy in 2008 and Brasil, Mexico, and the United Kingdom in 2009.|$|E
30|$|So, <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> 210 (51.09 %) participants, who had publications, {{it asked}} {{for them to}} further fill out the {{information}} regarding <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> publications, they had. In response to this query 32.3 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> {{did not have any}} publication in internationally proclaimed Journals and 21.9 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> have only one publication in internationality accredited Journals. Whereas, 13.8 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> have two publications in international scientific Journals. Similarly, 41.9 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> did not have any publication in national impact factor journals somehow 20.9 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> have only one publication and 12.3 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> have two publications. At the same time, 93.8 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> haven’t published any book and 80.5 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> have not written any chapter at all, in any book. Finding of this section somehow strengthens believe that women faculty member has published less. Some other studies also indicated that Jones et al. (2012) women faculty members found themselves more overburdened and they concentrate less on research. Another study revealed that in general faculties tend to publish less in recent years to highly competitive and specialized work. They tend to put more work in teachings as compared to research and publication unless they are appointed solely for research (Jones et al. 2012; Rajiv, Chu, and Jiang 2015).|$|R
30|$|So, <b>the</b> set <b>of</b> {{questions}} {{was asked to}} get <b>the</b> actual picture <b>of</b> publication in scientifically proclaimed sources. A recent research of Kimoto (2015) indicated that mostly male faculty members {{have been shown to}} engage positively in research to obtain research funding and greater results. In contrast, female faculty members struggle {{to strike a balance between}} the increased demand for undergraduate education and the effort required to research (Kimoto 2015). First of all, it was asked for <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> to fill out <b>the</b> details <b>of</b> any publication which they had until data collection. Significant majority 48.9 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> did not have any kind of publication at all, and at the same time, 9.9 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> had only one publication, although 8.1 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> have two publications, and 7.5 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> have three publications and 2.9 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> have four, 4.5 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> have five, 5.6 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> have six, 3.6 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> have seven, 9.0 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> have more than eight publications. As per the current data, it is somehow visible that women have published less in the sample universities. Although publication is a major pre- requisite to get the promotion and high rank in academia. It is more likely that if somebody did not meet the prerequisite criteria for promotion, they might stick to lower academic rungs. Some previous researchers have also found that women tend to have higher lecturing and academic workloads, so as a consequence women tend to publish less (Fridner et al. 2015; Schlegelmilch and Diamantopoulos 2015).|$|R

25|$|Cheater {{recognition}} {{is closely related}} to the recognition of specific emotions. Bell et al. argue for the existence of an emotional incongruity effect. Memory is better for the face of a smiling cheater than of a smiling cooperator, because the incongruity captures the attention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participant.</b> If the emotion violates the expectancy then it is much better remembered. Furthermore, negative information is much better remembered whether it violates expectancies or not. Negative emotions have a strong effect on source memory due to the presence of threatening stimuli.|$|E
25|$|Research has {{identified}} {{a number of}} OA practices significantly correlating with maintaining abstinence in OA: adherence to a food plan (including weighing and measuring food), communication with other members (specifically sponsors), spending time in prayer and meditation, performing service work, completing the fourth step, completing the ninth step, writing down thoughts and feelings, attending meetings, reading OA/AA literature, and the educational status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participant.</b> Researchers have therefore concluded that application of OA practices might directly help promote abstinence and reduce the frequency of relapse in those with binge eating disorder and bulimia nervosa.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypothesis}} of An Action-based Model of Cognitive-dissonance Processes (2015) proposed that psychological dissonance occurs consequent to the stimulation of thoughts {{that interfere with}} a goal-driven behavior. Researchers mapped the neural activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> when performing tasks that provoked psychological stress when engaged in contradictory behaviors. A participant read aloud the printed name of a color. To test for the occurrence of cognitive dissonance, {{the name of the}} color was printed in a color different than the word read aloud by the participant. As a result, the participants experienced increased neural activity in the anterior cingulate cortex when the experimental exercises provoked psychological dissonance.|$|E

Quite a number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> were not aware that it is not safe to defrost meat/thawing frozen meat over the counter at room temperature. Almost none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chinese <b>participants</b> reported using a thermometer to test the temperature when cooking meat. When storing food, none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> were aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recommended time (within 2  hours of cooking) and temperature for refrigerating or freezing cooked food.

25|$|The {{viewer is}} meant to {{participate}} with the artwork, manipulating the book and interacting with the pages up close.

25|$|Structured {{cognitive}} behavioral training (SCBT) is a cognitive-based {{process with}} core philosophies that draw heavily from CBT. Like CBT, SCBT asserts that behavior is inextricably related to beliefs, thoughts and emotions. SCBT also builds on core CBT philosophy by incorporating other well-known modalities {{in the fields}} of behavioral health and psychology: most notably, Albert Ellis's Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy. SCBT differs from CBT in two distinct ways. First, SCBT is delivered in a highly regimented format. Second, SCBT is a predetermined and finite training process that becomes personalized by the input <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participant.</b> SCBT is designed with the intention to bring a participant to a specific result in a specific period of time. SCBT has been used to challenge addictive behavior, particularly with substances such as tobacco, alcohol and food, and to manage diabetes and subdue stress and anxiety. SCBT has also been used in the field of criminal psychology in the effort to reduce recidivism.|$|E

The event started in 1960 with just over 200 teenagers taking part and has grown to include 2,400 teenagers from schools and youth organisations, mostly from the United Kingdom. The number of participants is capped at 2,400—400 groups of six—to minimise damage to the environment caused by the event. Participants start from the British Army training camp at Okehampton and are required to carry all their supplies for the trek and spend one night in a tent on the moor. Shaw's group, on a training expedition with dozens of other groups ahead of the main event, was accompanied by a teacher from Edgehill College designated the [...] "team manager". All team managers undergo compulsory training, run by the Army and the Dartmoor Rescue Group, which involves trekking the route themselves.|$|E
