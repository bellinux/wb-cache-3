500|$|In 2010, Hole [...] reused {{the portraits}} of Marie Antoinette and Anne Boleyn {{for the front}} and back covers of their fourth studio album, Nobody's Daughter. However, both of the portraits were cropped so as to depict both Antoinette and Boleyn as headless. The {{centerpiece}} of the vinyl LP <b>on</b> <b>My</b> <b>Body,</b> The Hand Grenade features a full-bodied portrait of Marie Antoinette, as opposed to the headless version seen on the cover of Nobody's Daughter.|$|E
2500|$|The term {{originates}} {{from the}} line at the end of Saint Paul's Letter to the Galatians where he says, [...] "I bear <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>body</b> the marks of Jesus." [...] Stigmata is the plural of the Greek word στίγμα stigma, meaning a mark, ...|$|E

6000|$|As {{he talked}} <b>on,</b> all <b>my</b> <b>body</b> began to tremble. The scene was moving indeed, {{but it was}} not that which stirred me so deeply, it was the man's voice and bearing that {{reminded}} me--no, it could scarcely be! ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Though 'Aakhri Khat' is {{my first}} film, I {{received}} my first break as a leading actor in Ravindra Dave's, 'Raaz', in 1967. My heroine was Babita, already a popular actress then. Though I had lots of confidence, I was shy in facing the camera initially. In my first three shots, I had to perform with stress <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>body</b> language and dialogue delivery. Though I was right with my dialogues, my movements were {{not up to the}} mark. Ravindra Dave explained me my scenes and movements very clearly correcting my way of walking." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anointing {{may also}} be given during Forgiveness Vespers and Great Week, on Great and Holy Wednesday, to all who are prepared. Those who receive Unction on Holy Wednesday should go to Holy Communion on Maundy Thursday. The {{significance}} of receiving Unction on Holy Wednesday is shored up by the hymns in the Triodion for that day, which speak of the sinful woman who anointed the feet of Christ (...) [...] Just as her sins were forgiven because of her penitence, so the faithful are exhorted to repent of their sins. In the same narrative, Jesus says, [...] "in that she hath poured this ointment <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>body,</b> she did it for my burial" [...] (Id., v. 12), linking the unction with Christ's death and resurrection.|$|E
2500|$|On 31 May 2012, Pietersen {{announced}} his retirement from one-day international cricket. Although he intended to still play Twenty20s for England, and especially the World Twenty20 tournament in September 2012, the terms of his central contract meant {{that he had to}} retire from both forms. Remaining available for Test cricket only, Pietersen said that [...] "with the intensity of the international schedule and the increasing demands <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>body,</b> I think it is the right time to step aside and let the next generation of players come through to gain experience for the World Cup in 2015." [...] This announcement came {{on the back of his}} 80 against the West Indies at Trent Bridge as England took an unassailable 2–0 lead in the three-Test series. However, on 9 July 2012, Pietersen reversed his decision and suggested that he may return to ODIs in the future.|$|E
50|$|Hadise is the self-titled second studio album by Belgian-Turkish singer Hadise. The album {{has so far}} already {{produced}} 4 singles {{from the}} album, these include <b>My</b> <b>Body,</b> A Good Kiss, Deli Oğlan and My Man and the Devil <b>on</b> His Shoulder. <b>My</b> <b>Body</b> has become Hadise's most successful single peaking at 8 on the Ultratop 50 chart (Flanders).|$|R
60|$|I {{would have}} kept <b>on,</b> {{punishing}} <b>my</b> own <b>body</b> because Master Hadley's people had failed to show hospitality; but Silas accepted the invitation without ado, and threw himself down upon the moss nearby the door as if too weary to advance any further.|$|R
60|$|Two {{or three}} men trod <b>on</b> <b>my</b> panting <b>body</b> as they drew water, {{but they were}} evidently used {{to this sort of}} thing, and had no time to waste upon me. The {{situation}} was humiliating. Gunga Dass, indeed, when he had banked the embers of his fire with sand, was at some pains to throw half a cupful of fetid water over my head, an attention for which I could have fallen <b>on</b> <b>my</b> knees and thanked him, but he was laughing all the while in the same mirthless, wheezy key that greeted me <b>on</b> <b>my</b> first attempt to force the shoals. And so, in a semi-comatose condition, I lay till noon.|$|R
6000|$|Long {{fled the}} foam-flakes around me, the winds fled {{out of the}} vast, [...] Snatching the bird in secret, nor knew I, embosomed apart, [...] When they froze the cloth <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>body</b> like armour riveted fast, [...] For Remembrance, lifting her leanness, keened in the gates of my [...] heart.|$|E
60|$|THE SERPENT. It nearly tore me asunder. Yet I am alive, and can burst my {{skin and}} renew myself as before. Soon {{there will be}} as many snakes in Eden as there are scales <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>body.</b> Then death will not matter: this snake and that snake will die; but the snakes will live.|$|E

"It matters nothing," [...] he said, [...] "my being arrested, They {{can prove}} nothing against me, as I shall have no papers <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>body,</b> {{while it is}} all-important that you should get off. The most {{that they can do}} to me is to send me to London, and a term of {{imprisonment}} as a malignant is the worst that will befall me." ...|$|E
60|$|Thus I tore <b>on,</b> <b>my</b> very <b>body</b> ragged and {{bleeding}} {{from head to}} foot, and thus I came to the pool in the torrent's course. Into this I plunged, and stood with the icy waters almost to my neck, to purge the unholy fevers out of me. The snows above were melting at the time, and the pool {{was little more than}} liquid ice. The chill of it struck through me to the very marrow, and I felt my flesh creep and contract until it seemed like the rough hide of some fabled monster, and my wounds stung as if fire were being poured into them.|$|R
5000|$|This {{system was}} called [...] "sardine packing" [...] (Sardinenpackung). It was {{reported}} that {{even some of the}} experienced Einsatzgruppen killers were horrified by its cruelty. At Rumbula, Jeckeln watched on both days of the massacre as 25,000 people were killed before him. Jeckeln proved to be an effective killer who cared nothing about murdering huge numbers of unarmed and even naked men, women, children and the elderly. [...] One of the three survivors of the Rumbala massacre, Frida Michelson, escaped by pretending to be dead as the victims heaped shoes (later salvaged by Jeckeln's men) upon her: A mountain of footwear was pressing down <b>on</b> me. <b>My</b> <b>body</b> was numb from cold and immobility. However, I was fully conscious now. The snow under me had melted from the heat of <b>my</b> <b>body.</b> ... Quiet for a while. Then {{from the direction of the}} trench a child's cry: 'Mama! Mama! Mamaa!'. A few shots. Quiet. Killed.|$|R
6000|$|And like a {{bullfinch}} I {{piped up}} {{in response to}} the best of my ability. My answers, I fear, were usually evasive. For I had begun to see that she was making experiments <b>on</b> <b>my</b> mind and senses, as well as <b>on</b> <b>my</b> manners and <b>body.</b> She was a [...] "fancier." [...] And one day I ogled up at her with the pert remark that she now possessed a pocket barometer which would do its very utmost to remain at 31°, if that was possible without being [...] "Very Dry." ...|$|R
60|$|After {{a time he}} yawned, {{rolled over}} on his side, and {{inspected}} an angry- looking sore just above his hip. This he proceeded to cleanse and dress by the crude methods men in solitary must employ. I recognized the sore {{as one of the}} sort caused by the strait-jacket. <b>On</b> <b>my</b> <b>body,</b> at this moment of writing, are hundreds of scars of the jacket.|$|E
6000|$|... “But beside all this, {{the bulk}} of our people {{supported}} themselves by furnishing the necessities or conveniences of life to the rich and to each other. For instance, when I am at home, and dressed as I ought to be, I carry <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>body</b> the workmanship of a hundred tradesmen; the building and furniture of my house employ as many more, and five times the number to adorn my wife.” ...|$|E
60|$|But I, the drink-boy, Ragnar Lodbrog, did not burn. I was eleven, and unafraid, and {{had never}} worn woven cloth <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>body.</b> And as the flames sprang up, and Elgiva sang her death-song, and the thralls and slaves screeched their unwillingness to die, I tore away my fastenings, leaped, and gained the fens, the gold collar of my slavehood still on my neck, footing it with the hounds loosed to tear me down.|$|E
60|$|Nineteen {{hours a day}} I studied. For {{three months}} I kept this pace, only {{breaking}} it <b>on</b> several occasions. <b>My</b> <b>body</b> grew weary, <b>my</b> mind grew weary, but I stayed with it. My eyes grew weary and began to twitch, {{but they did not}} break down. Perhaps, toward the last, I got a bit dotty. I know that at the time I was confident, I had discovered the formula for squaring the circle; but I resolutely deferred the working of it out until after the examinations. Then I would show them.|$|R
5000|$|Speaking {{about her}} injury-plagued 2012 season, Williams stated, [...] "I just {{had so much}} going <b>on</b> and <b>my</b> <b>body</b> just started to break down. If someone had asked me before what my worst setback was, I would have said coming second at the world juniors, {{but this was a}} proper setback. That was my first real setback year. It was hard, as I'd not been used to dealing with {{setbacks}} before." [...] She added, [...] "It was tough to sit back and watch it, to see other people competing, and thinking I could have been there at the home Olympics, but then I told myself I'm 18 and there's hopefully plenty more Olympics ahead of me. It wasn't nice sitting at home, and {{it took me a while}} to get over that." ...|$|R

"By Cot! and it's very {{exceedingly}} true, my goot friend, Sir Binco--and as you say, {{it concerns}} your honour, and the honour of the place, and credit {{and character of}} the whole company, by Cot! that this matter be properly looked after; for, as I think, he laid hands <b>on</b> your <b>body,</b> <b>my</b> excellent goot friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not seriously, madam; but I feel {{somewhat}} faint from loss of blood, {{and will}} remove my helmet. As it turned out," [...] {{he went on}} somewhat faintly, [...] "it was unfortunate that I did not put <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>body</b> armour; but I had not anticipated hard fighting, and preferred to ride without it. Thanks for your offer, lady, but my men will see to me, they are all of them pretty well accustomed to the bandaging of wounds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{see how a}} {{wise man}} is lost by fortune. When I come here, whom should I find but Dolfin himself? The dog had scent of my plan, {{all the way from}} Dolfinston there, by Peebles. He hunts me out, the hungry Scotch wolf; rides for Leith, takes ship, and is here to meet me, having accused me before Baldwin as a robber and ravisher, and offers to prove his right to the jade <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>body</b> in single combat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'As a rule I {{should do}} the same thing, Mr. Bunny; but, {{although}} I'm really ashamed to admit it, {{this is one of}} the days when I'm afraid of Mr. Man's gun. Now I wouldn't have you tell that to any living creature; but somehow, the sight of his gun sent the cold chills down every feather <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>body.</b> He's out for business this afternoon, and when I came across him he was carrying Bobby Coon by the tail, which shows he's ready to kill anything and everything that comes his way.' ...|$|E

Following the impulse of the outer world when dealing with natives, I put my hand into my pocket and drew out four annas. The absurdity of the gift struck me at once, and I was about to replace the money.|$|R
2500|$|On July 31, 2007, Donaire met Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Donaire {{said the}} {{experience}} was, [...] "an overwhelming feeling. It was indescribable. The moment I {{walked up the}} stairs and she was up there and when I looked it was a moment when I couldn't even look at her face. It was a great honor." [...] Then, on December 1, 2007, Donaire made the first defense of his IBF title against Luis Maldonado of Mexico by a technical knockout in the eighth round. Donaire said, [...] "I guess my validation was today but I didn't feel my best; I felt sluggish. I didn't have my legs. I don't know what the problem was. I couldn't move well so I tried to rely <b>on</b> <b>my</b> upper <b>body</b> movement." ...|$|R

I was sixteen, and a man, ere ever I wore woven cloth <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>body.</b> I was birthed in storm, after battle, and my swaddling cloth was a wolfskin.

60|$|Under the {{powerful}} {{influence of the}} near treatment and the absent treatment together, my bones were gradually retreating inward and disappearing from view. The good work took a brisk start, now, and went <b>on</b> swiftly. <b>My</b> <b>body</b> was diligently straining and stretching, this way and that, to accommodate the processes of restoration, and every minute or two I heard a dull click inside and knew that the two ends of a fracture had been successfully joined. This muffled clicking and gritting and grinding and rasping continued during the next three hours, and then stopped--the connections had all been made. All except dislocations; there were only seven of these: hips, shoulders, knees, neck; so that was soon over; one after another they slipped into their sockets with a sound like pulling a distant cork, and I jumped up as good as new, as to framework, and sent for the horse-doctor.|$|R
