40|$|Performance {{analysis}} {{has been carried}} out on a high side scroll compressor having a fixed scroll equipped with a circular oil groove on its thrust surface. Oil is supplied to the oil groove through an intermittent opening from a high pressure oil reservoir formed inside the orbiting scroll hub. Oil in the groove is then delivered to both suction and back pressure chambers by pressure differentials and viscous pumping action of the orbiting scroll base plate. Mathematical modeling of this oil groove system has been incorporated into main compressor performance simulation program for optimum oil groove design. Pressure in the oil groove can be controlled by changing the <b>oil</b> <b>passage</b> area and <b>oil</b> groove configuration. With an enlarged <b>oil</b> <b>passage,</b> pressure in the oil groove increases due to increased flow rate, but pressure increase in the back pressure chamber is not that large, resulting in reduced friction loss at the thrust surface between the two scrolls. On the other hand, by increasing the <b>oil</b> <b>passage</b> area, <b>oil</b> content in the refrigerant flow increases, and the orbiting scroll stability could be negatively affected by oil groove pressure increase. Considering all these factors, EER could be improved by about 3. 6 % at ARI condition by optimum oil groove design...|$|R

40|$|The study {{concentrates}} {{on the effects of}} structural parameters of an electronic fuel injector on its dynamic response (the opening delay and the closing delay). The injector was developed for a marine medium-speed diesel engine. The dynamic response {{from the start of the}} control signal to the end of the needle valve closing were investigated. Firstly, a complete and detailed model of the electronic fuel injector was built and integrated into an optimisation model, where a MOGA was applied. Secondly, the importance and effects of main structural parameters on dynamic response were examined, as were their interactions. Finally, a Pareto optimum was obtained through scattering charts and comparisons were made between the baseline design and the optimal design. Results show that the control piston diameter, fuel <b>oil</b> inlet <b>passage</b> diameter, fuel <b>oil</b> outlet <b>passage</b> diameter and their interactions are influential factors to the opening delay, while the fuel <b>oil</b> inlet <b>passage</b> diameter has the dominant effect on the closing delay. A small control piston diameter together with a small fuel <b>oil</b> inlet <b>passage</b> diameter contribute to a short opening delay, however, they lead to a significant increase in the closing delay.

50|$|The oiling system {{addresses}} {{the need to}} properly lubricate an engine when it’s running. Properly lubricating an engine not only reduces friction between moving parts but is also the main method by which heat is removed from pistons, bearings, and shafts. Failing to properly lubricate an engine will result in engine failure. The oil pump forces the motor oil through the passages in the engine to properly distribute oil to different engine components. In a common oiling system, oil is drawn out of the oil sump (oil pan, in US English) through a wire mesh strainer that removes {{some of the larger}} pieces of debris from the oil. The flow made by the oil pump allows the oil to be distributed around the engine. In this system, oil flows through an oil filter and sometimes an oil cooler, before going through the engine’s <b>oil</b> <b>passages</b> and being dispersed to lubricate pistons, rings, springs, valve stems, and more.|$|E
5000|$|Compressed air is {{the most}} common power source for impact wrenches, {{providing}} a low-cost design with the best power-to-weight ratio. A simple vane motor is almost always used, usually with four to seven vanes, and various lubrication systems, the most common of which uses oiled air, while others may include special <b>oil</b> <b>passages</b> routed to the parts that need it and a separate, sealed oil system for the hammer assembly. Most impact wrenches drive the hammer directly from the motor, giving it fast action when the fastener requires only low torque. Other designs use a gear reduction system before the hammer mechanism, most often a single-stage planetary gearset usually with a heavier hammer, delivering a more constant speed and higher [...] "spin" [...] torque. Electric impact wrenches are available, either mains powered, or for automotive use, 12-volt, 18-volt or 24-volt DC-powered. Recently, cordless electric impact wrenches have become common, although typically their power outputs are significantly lower than corded electric or air-powered equivalents. Some industrial tools are hydraulically powered, using high-speed hydraulic motors, and are used in some heavy equipment repair shops, large construction sites, and other areas where a suitable hydraulic supply is available. Hydraulic impact wrenches have the advantage of high power-to-weight ratio.|$|E

Changes started at the front, with tapered bearings in the steering head instead of the KZ750's ball bearings, and the upper triple clamp was changed also, giving the GPz solid aluminum clip-on handle grips instead of the traditional handlebar. A bikini fairing almost identical to the one on the GPz550 was added too. The GPz750 boasted increased power, with slightly higher compression, and camshafts designed to get the valves to full lift quicker, and fitting Mikuni 34mm carburetors to it for smoother airflow.

However, real <b>oil</b> <b>passages,</b> such as in manifolds and <b>oil</b> <b>passages</b> in an automatic transmission in a car, have complex configurations.

40|$|Cylinder liner {{surfaces}} are {{often on the}} agenda of engine developers because of their large influence on the frictional losses, oil consumption and emissions of internal combustion engines. Improving the liner function involves not only manufacturing new surfaces and checking their function but also characterising them as a necessary intermediate step for better understanding of the changes made. In the manufacturing of the liners, honing is a well adapted and widely used finishing process and along with the characterisation and function {{has been the subject of}} studies in this thesis. Regarding the liner’s function, three phenomena were monitored: wear, friction and <b>oil</b> <b>passage</b> rate (correlated with engine’s oil consumption). The first one was studied experimentally while the other two were simulated. Only the interactions with the twin land oil control ring were simulated as it has the greatest influence on the control of friction and oil consumption of all other rings. In the mid-stroke region of truck engine liners, the presence of axial wear scratches was observed and their relation with the removal of the cold worked material (“Blechmantel”) folded inside the deep honing grooves was investigated. Algorithms were developed for estimating the extent of Blechmantel, revealing that most of it remained on the surface whereas the engines still performed well. Other algorithms for characterising honing angle, balance of honing texture, width, height, distance between honing grooves/axial wear scratches, etc were developed for quicker and more objective inspection of unworn and worn surfaces from 3 D interference measurements. Based on such 3 D measurements, the algorithms were incorporated in a characterisation tool enabling rating of the surfaces and determining the number of measurements necessary to achieve stable roughness parameter values. In addition, it was found that interference measurements are more suitable for quantification of the deposits on the worn truck liner surfaces compared with scanning electron microscope measurements. The lubrication and friction of flat oil control ring lands and differently slide honed surfaces of truck liners were simulated. Friction mean effective pressure and <b>oil</b> <b>passage</b> rate were calculated for each surface showing in each case a reduction for the surfaces with smoother plateaus and smaller valleys. Such a liner surface was finished by using a low base honing pressure and a longer plateau honing time. In a car engine, the influence of different liner surfaces, ring land widths and tensions was examined by running simulations. The results suggest that a considerably improved function can be achieved if the ring land width and tension are reduced whereby the differences between the liner surfaces would reduce...|$|R

40|$|Many {{theoretical}} {{models have been}} developed to simulate the performance of hydraulic Control components and systems, but all are limited by the assumptions involved and uncertain factors associated with practical hydraulic systems. Authors warn that seal compressibility, inertia of oil in lines, mounting compliance, structural damping, friction and cavitation may each be significant in appropriate circumstances,and even the bulk modulus of hydraulic oil is difficult to predict for practical systems. Manufacturers may reject theoretically predictable designs because they are prone to wear or expensive to make. For instance sharp edged orifices are replaced by the short tube type and <b>oil</b> <b>passages</b> consist of drilled holes intersecting at angles with frequent changes in section. The prospect of obtaining a comprehensive mathematical model applicable to manufactured components is therefore remote due to the uncertainties and complexities involved but the designer will require models and methods of solution sufficient for his purposes which are to obtain a reasonable prediction of performance at the design stage. 'Design' may mean the design of a hydraulic circuit component, such a pump or relief valve, or may involve matching standard components to form a system. Ideally the designer requires a model of each system component which can be assembled with all other component models to form a comprehensive system model which can be solved mathematically. If linear models are possible an exact final solution may be feasible but when non-linearities are present, a digital simulation of the model giving a time response to defined inputs may be the only practical method of solution and, inevitably, the designer is involved with the problems of computation. Computers are now commonplace in design offices, Small computer installations offer a hands,-on facility which is flexible and versatile whilst large installations offer enormous capacity and capability but are often remotely located with inflexible management procedures ill-suited to the trial and error design techniques often required for component design optimisation. As such,a small computer may offer the most efficient means of solving these design problems. This thesis is concerned with methods of modelling hydraulic components and systems with particular emphasis placed on the use of a small computer installation for digital simulation of models, and for other tasks related to laboratory testing of actual systems. The basic aims are to obtain physical and mathematical models of an existing electro-hydraulic two-stage servo-valve, to use a small computer to predict open and closed-loop responses, to obtain actual system responses for comparison with those predicted, and to examine non-linearities encountered. The thesis is set out in the order in which the work was done. Initially similar work was studied and extended after which the servo-valve was measured and tests were conducted to ascertain physical constants required for the system equations. A linear model was then simulated and actual system responses were obtained for comparison with the first linear model. After this the linear model was slightly modified and other more advanced non-linear models developed.

30|$|In {{the piston}} {{manufacturing}} plant, a {{gravity die casting}} process is {{carried out in the}} foundry to make the piston with the help of semiautomatic die machines without external pressures. The resultant pistons are sent for cleaning up the surface of the piston from the risers and runners and later, the strength, hardness, and other foundry defects are evaluated.

As the 3.0L engine uses the same head <b>oil</b> <b>passage</b> design, yet does not appear to exhibit the problem - it might be that the larger bore in the 3.5 engine, the higher pressures, and resulting smaller head gasket surface area could conspire to cause a gasket erosion issue. Elevated oil consumption is an early warning of imminent problems. Some anecdotal sources suggest that the connecting rods are weak. [...] With a bent rod comes ovaling of the bore as the 3.5L block does not have sufficient bore material to allow for sleeving. If one catches the problem before it has progressed too far (after elevated oil consumption starts, but before the bent rod occurs) the issue can be alleviated with a head gasket replacement.
