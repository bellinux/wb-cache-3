5|$|Apple's US distributor, Capitol Records, {{mastered}} the single {{to run at}} a faster speed than the album track, {{in order to make}} the song sound brighter on the radio. Unusually for an Apple release by a former Beatle, the single was packaged in a plain sleeve in the main markets of Britain and the United States. A variety <b>of</b> <b>picture</b> sleeves were available in European countries, including a design incorporating Harrison's signature and a red Om symbol, both of which were aspects of Tom Wilkes's artwork for the Material World album.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the telerecorded material, some early 1970s material survives only, or in colour only, on NTSC videotapes produced for North American transmission (e.g., TV Ontario and CKVU in Vancouver). NTSC runs at a different framerate than PAL video, and has a different number of scanlines. The conversion process used in the 1970s was primitive by modern standards, resulting in a noticeable amount <b>of</b> <b>picture</b> and motion loss. Converting the NTSC tapes back to PAL introduces more artifacts, creating a blurry picture and juddering motion. To rectify the problem, in 2005 a new Reverse Standards Conversion process, which attempts to unpick the original video conversion, was introduced for the DVD release of The Claws of Axos.|$|E
5|$|The John Day River, a {{tributary}} of the Columbia River, flows generally west from the Strawberry Mountains before reaching the national monument. It turns sharply north between the Mascall Formation Overlook and Kimberly, where the North Fork John Day River joins the main stem. Downstream of Kimberly, the river flows generally west to downstream of the unincorporated community of Twickenham, and generally north thereafter. Rock Creek enters the river at the north end <b>of</b> <b>Picture</b> Gorge. Bridge Creek passes through Mitchell, then north along {{the eastern edge of the}} Painted Hills Unit to meet the John Day downstream of Twickenham. Intermittent streams in the Clarno Unit empty into Pine Creek, which flows just beyond the south edge of the unit and enters the John Day upstream of the unincorporated community of Clarno.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} scenario and {{concept of}} Final Fantasy Type-0, originally a mobile title named Final Fantasy Agito XIII, was conceived by Hajime Tabata. He wished for a group-driven story {{as he felt}} that a single playable character {{would not be able}} to properly convey the scope and themes of the story. Because Tabata wanted to show a history of survival told from the point of view of young people caught in a war, it was decided to set the story during a war between four nations. Much of the original story, which mainly revolved about defying the gods, was drawn from popular anime and manga and did not survive. After the platform change to PlayStation Portable, Tabata adopted a story-telling style similar to a documentary film: a direct inspiration for this was Centuries <b>of</b> <b>Picture,</b> a documentary series broadcast on NHK. Alongside that, multiple war films were used as inspiration. Type-0s script was written by Hiroki Chiba and Sarah Okabe. During the rough draft stage, elements such as extra plot points involving Khalia Chival, a boss fight with Arecia, and a main plot thread involving Joker and Tiz were planned. Most of these elements were cut from the final product, meaning elements such as Joker and Tiz's role needed to be included in written texts found in-game so they were not left hanging. The deaths of Class Zero were planned from an early stage, and to emphasize the state of the world, a large number of the supporting cast were killed off near the end. Tabata wanted to create a story depicting different fates for Type-0s characters, and this decision was supported by both staff members and fans of the original. He also implemented the ability for players to decide the course of the story, which was to have been included in the Type-0 when it was still known as Agito XIII. Final Fantasy Agito was given a more upbeat atmosphere when compared to Type-0, although dark and more dramatic moments were still present. The story grew out of what Tabata originally envisioned for Type-0.|$|E

40|$|In an {{experimental}} setting, we applied a dual strategy {{to better understand}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> eyes on human behavior. First, we investigated whether the effect of eyes was limited to interaction tasks in which the subjects’ decisions influenced the outcomes of other subjects. We expanded the range of tasks to include individual choice tasks in which the subjects’ decisions only influenced their own outcomes. Second, we investigated whether <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> eyes were one of many social cues or were unique in their effect. We compared the effect <b>of</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> eyes with the effect of a different condition in which we presented the subjects with <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> other students (peers). Our results suggest that the effect <b>of</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> eyes is limited to interaction tasks and that eyes should be considered distinct from other social cues, such as reminders <b>of</b> peers. While <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> eyes uniformly enhanced pro-social behavior in interaction tasks, {{this was not the case}} for reminders of peers. Furthermore, the reminders of peers led to more rational behavior in individual choice tasks, whereas the effect <b>of</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> eyes was limited to situations involving interaction. Combined, these findings are in line with the claim that the effect <b>of</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> eyes on behavior is caused by a social exchange heuristic that works to enhance mutual cooperative behavior...|$|R

25|$|Many {{pigments}} and dyes absorb UV {{and change}} colour, so paintings and textiles may need extra protection both from sunlight and fluorescent bulbs, two common sources of UV radiation. Window glass absorbs some harmful UV, but valuable artifacts need extra shielding. Many museums place black curtains over watercolour paintings and ancient textiles, for example. Since watercolours can have very low pigment levels, they need extra protection from UV. Various forms <b>of</b> <b>picture</b> framing glass, including acrylics (plexiglass), laminates, and coatings, offer {{different degrees of}} UV (and visible light) protection.|$|E
