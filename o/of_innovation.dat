40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between foreign ownership and <b>innovations</b> <b>of</b> high novelty in context of advanced developing countries. We develop hypotheses about a direct relationship in terms of two dimensions, propensity and intensity <b>of</b> <b>innovations</b> <b>of</b> high novelty, and a contingency hypothesis about the moderating impact of R&D internationalisation on the relationship with propensity. The analysis is based on innovation survey data on manufacturing firms from Jiangsu province of China. Hypotheses are tested using non-parametric methods. We find that foreign firms {{do not have a}} higher propensity <b>of</b> <b>innovations</b> <b>of</b> high novelty, not even when they engage in formal R&D. However, the evidence suggests that foreign firms have a higher intensity <b>of</b> <b>innovations</b> <b>of</b> high novelty than domestic firms...|$|R

Tom Bramwell, writing for Eurogamer, praised the overall feel of the game, from the dual screen functionality to the battle and character class systems, although noted nothing that elevated the game to new heights, and said that the inclusion of newcomer-friendly mechanics clashed with the permanent death mechanic. Shiva Stella of GameSpot enjoyed the tactical elements, openness to newcomers and multiplayer elements; but found the weakness of new recruits and map restrictions detracted from the experience. IGN's Daemon Hatfield, while again noting a lack <b>of</b> <b>innovation,</b> found {{it one of the most}} balanced strategy games available at the time. Stuart Reddick of Nintendo Life greatly enjoyed the gameplay experience and praised the developer's efforts at balancing the various elements, but noted that it felt dated compared to both later Fire Emblem titles and other recent titles within the genre. Fred Dutton of Official Nintendo Magazine was highly positive, praising the classic gameplay, new features, and multiplayer functions.
