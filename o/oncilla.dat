25|$|The <b>oncilla</b> is a {{primarily}} terrestrial animal, {{but is also}} an adept climber. Like all cats, the <b>oncilla</b> is an obligate carnivore, requiring {{meat for}} survival. This cat eats small mammals, lizards, birds, eggs, invertebrates, and the occasional tree frog. Occasionally, the cat will eat grasses. The <b>oncilla</b> stalks its prey from a distance, and once in range, it pounces to catch and kill the prey.|$|E
25|$|Hybridization of the <b>oncilla</b> {{with the}} Geoffroy's cat (Leopardus geoffroyi) {{has been found}} in the southernmost part of its range; {{hybridization}} with the pampas cat (Leopardus pajeros) has also been found in central Brazil. Such hybridization may be a natural process, and the extent of this {{as a threat to the}} <b>oncilla</b> is unknown.|$|E
25|$|Although the Central American <b>oncilla</b> {{is listed}} as a {{separate}} subspecies, based on analysis of mitochondrial DNA, Johnson et al. (1999) found strongly supported differences between L.t. <b>oncilla</b> in Costa Rica and L.t. guttulus in southern Brazil, comparable to differences between different neotropical species. Researchers have argued {{that there should be}} a splitting of the <b>oncilla</b> into two species, as there is a pronounced difference in appearance between the oncillas in Costa Rica and those in central and southern Brazil. The level of divergence between oncillas from Costa Rica and from central and southern Brazil suggests that the two populations have been isolated, perhaps by the Amazon River, for approximately 3.7 million years. Further samples of L.t. <b>oncilla</b> are needed from northern South America to determine whether this taxon ranges outside Central America, and whether it should be considered a distinct species rather than a subspecies.|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of coat colour polymorphisms in populations may promote the ecological success of species by permitting a wider spectrum {{of use of}} different subsets of available resources. We conducted an analysis of temporal segregation by comparing night brightness with nocturnal activity of spotted and melanistic <b>oncillas</b> (Leopardus tigrinus). Melanistic <b>oncillas</b> were more active during bright nights and spotted <b>oncillas</b> and other species were more active during dark nights. Each colour morph occupied a temporal niche outside the confidence interval of the other colour morph, demonstrating the ecological significance of polymorphic colour patterns in this felid species...|$|R
25|$|Some melanistic <b>oncillas</b> {{have been}} {{reported}} from the more heavily forested parts of its range.|$|R

25|$|The <b>oncilla</b> is {{distributed}} from Costa Rica and Panama {{up to the}} Amazon basin and Central Brazil.|$|E
25|$|The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{classified}} the <b>oncilla</b> as vulnerable. The chief {{threats to}} these felines are deforestation and poaching. Oncillas are killed for their pelts, which are highly prized and often sold or made into clothing. Reports in 1972 and 1982 in South America {{showed that the}} <b>oncilla</b> {{is one of the}} four most heavily hunted of all the small cats.|$|E
25|$|A zone of {{hybridization}} {{between the}} <b>oncilla</b> and the colocolo {{has been found}} through genetic analyses of specimens from central Brazil.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oncillas</b> reach sexual {{maturity}} at around two to {{two and a}} half years of age. They have a life span of about 11 years in the wild, but there are records of these cats reaching an age of 17 years.|$|R
50|$|The path {{continues}} {{past the}} enclosures of the margays (Leopardus wiedi), Geoffroy's cats (Oncifelis geoffroyi), the <b>oncillas</b> (Leopardus tigrinus), and the pumas (Puma concolor). Finally one {{arrives at a}} dead end, to admire the jaguarundis (Herpailurus yaguarondi) which are very rare in European zoos.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} insectivorous, {{and is an}} {{opportunistic}} forager, not specialising in any particular kind of insect. Individuals have also been reported to eat some spiders, snails, and even fruit (including passionfruit). Predators of Brazilian gracile opossums include ocelots, <b>oncillas,</b> crab-eating foxes, maned wolves and white-tailed hawks.|$|R
25|$|CITES {{places the}} <b>oncilla</b> on Appendix I, prohibiting all {{international}} commerce in oncillas or products made from them. Hunting is still allowed in Ecuador, Guyana, Nicaragua, and Peru.|$|E
25|$|Another factor {{contributing}} to <b>oncilla</b> mortality is human expansion, settling what was once open terrain for wild cats. Coffee plantations are most often established in cloud forest habitats, causing the reduction of preferred habitats.|$|E
25|$|The <b>oncilla</b> (Leopardus tigrinus), {{also known}} as the {{northern}} tiger cat, little spotted cat, and tigrillo, is a small spotted cat ranging from Central America up to central Brazil. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because the population is threatened by deforestation and conversion of habitat to agriculture.|$|E
25|$|They are {{generally}} nocturnal, but {{in areas such}} as Caatinga, where their main food source consists of diurnal lizards, {{they are more likely to}} be active during the day. Young <b>oncillas</b> have been observed to purr, while adults are known to make short, gurgling calls when close to one another.|$|R
50|$|Ocelots may mate at {{any time}} of the year, and the time when peaks occur varies {{geographically}} - peaks have been observed during autumn and winter in Mexico and Texas, and during autumn in Argentina and Paraguay. Oestrus lasts four to five days, and recurs every 25 days in a non-pregnant female. A study in southern Brazil showed that sperm production in ocelots, margays as well as <b>oncillas</b> peaks in summer. Observations of captive ocelots suggest that a mating pair will spend more time together; both will scent-mark extensively and may even eat less.|$|R

25|$|There is a {{breeding}} facility in Brazil for several small native felines, where their natural conditions and native food encourage reproduction {{similar to that}} in the wild. There are a few oncillas in captivity in North America, and a few in zoos in Europe and South America. In captivity, the <b>oncilla</b> tends to have high infant mortality rate.|$|E
25|$|Results of a {{morphological}} analysis of 250 samples of skins and skulls {{indicate that there}} are three distinct <b>oncilla</b> groups: namely one in South America's northern, north-western and western range countries, one in eastern and one in southern range countries. Based on these results, the eastern group was proposed to be a distinct species Leopardus emiliae.|$|E
25|$|The wild canids {{found in}} Brazil are the maned wolf, bush dog, hoary fox, short-eared dog, crab-eating fox and pampas fox. The felines found in Brazil are the jaguar, the puma, the margay, the ocelot, the <b>oncilla,</b> and the jaguarundi. Other notable animals include the giant anteater, several {{varieties}} of sloths and armadillos, coati, giant river otter, tapir, peccaries, marsh deer, Pampas deer, and capybara (the world's largest existing rodent). There are around 75 primate species, including the howler monkey, the capuchin monkey, and the squirrel monkey, the marmoset, and the tamarin.|$|E
40|$|In Brazil, Oligacanthorhynchus pardalis (Westrumb, 1821) Schmidt, 1972 {{has been}} {{observed}} in five species of wild felines. In the present study, five roadkilled <b>oncillas</b> (Leopardus tigrinus Schreber, 1775) were collected in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Chronic lesions caused by O. pardalis were observed in the small intestine {{of one of the}} specimens. Histological examination identified a well-defined leukocyte infiltration and an area of collagenous fibrosis. Only males parasites (n = 5) were found, with a prevalence of 20 %. The life cycle of Oligacanthorhynchus species is poorly known, although arthropods may be their intermediate hosts. The low prevalence encountered {{may be related to the}} small number of hosts examined, and the reduced ingestion of arthropods infected by larvae of O. pardalis. This is the first report of O. pardalis parasitizing L. tigrinus in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the frequency of occurrence and variety of intestinal parasites among free-living wild animals. Fecal samples from wild mammals and birds at rehabilitation centers in the states of Mato Grosso do Sul and S&# 227;o Paulo were analyzed by sedimentation and flotation-centrifugation methods. Parasite eggs, oocysts, cysts and/or trophozoites were found in 71 % of the samples. Cryptosporidiumsp. oocysts were detected in fecal samples from <b>oncillas</b> (Leopardus tigrinus) and scaly-headed parrots (Pionus maximiliani). Giardia cysts were identified in the feces of a gray brocket (Mazama gouazoubira). Among the most common parasites found, there were eggs from Toxocara cati,Toxascaris leonina and Ancylostoma tubaeforme, and from Cestoda. Several Enterobiussp. eggs were found in the feces of red howler monkeys (Alouatta seniculus). It can be concluded from this study that despite the small number of samples, the diversity of parasites found was noteworthy. Additional information about parasite endofauna in wild animals is needed, since their presence might suggest that there could be proximity to and interactions with domestic animals and/or humans. In addition, further studies on parasites from free-living wild animals are of prime importance for understanding the intensity of anthropic changes in wild environments...|$|R
40|$|Misiones, Argentina, {{contains}} the largest remaining tract of Upper Paraná Atlantic Forest ecoregion; however, ~ 50 % of native forest is unprotected and {{located in a}} mosaic of plantations, agriculture, and pastures. Existing protected areas are becoming increasingly isolated due to ongoing habitat modification. These factors, combined with lower than expected regional carnivore densities, emphasize the {{need to understand the}} effect of fragmentation on animal movement and connectivity between protected areas. Using detection dogs and genetic analyses of scat, we collected data on jaguars (Panthera onca), pumas (Puma concolor), ocelots (Leopardus pardalis), <b>oncillas</b> (Leopardus tigrinus), and bush dogs (Speothos venaticus) across habitats that varied in vegetation, disturbance, human proximity, and protective status. With MaxEnt we evaluated habitat use, habitat suitability, and potential species richness for the five carnivores across northern-central Misiones, Argentina. Through a multifaceted cost analysis that included unique requirements of each carnivore and varying degrees of overlap among them, we determined the optimal location for primary/secondary corridors that would link the northern-central zones of the Green Corridor in Misiones and identified areas within these corridors needing priority management. A secondary analysis, comparing these multispecies corridors with the jaguar's unique requirements, demonstrated that this multispecies approach balanced the preferences of all five species and effectively captured areas required by this highly restricted and endangered carnivore. We emphasize the potential importance of expanding beyond a single umbrella or focal species when developing biological corridors that aim to capture the varied ecological requirements of coexisting species and ecological processes across the landscape. Detection dogs and genetic analyses of scat allow data on multiple species to be collected efficiently across multiple habitat types independent of the degree of legal protection. These data used with multifocal GIS analyses balance the varying degree of overlap and unique properties among them allowing for comprehensive conservation strategies to be developed relatively rapidly. Our comprehensive approach serves as a model to other regions faced with habitat loss and lack of data. The five carnivores focused on in our study have wide ranges, so the results from this study can be expanded and combined with surrounding countries, with analyses at the species or community level...|$|R
25|$|The fur {{is thick}} and soft, ranging from light brown to dark ochre, with {{numerous}} dark rosettes {{across the back}} and flanks. The underside is pale with dark spots and the tail is ringed. The backs of the ears are black with bold ocelli. The rosettes are black or brown, open in the center, and irregularly shaped. The legs have medium-sized spots tapering to smaller spots near the paws. This coloration helps the <b>oncilla</b> {{blend in with the}} mottled sunlight of the tropical forest understory. The oncilla's jaw is shortened, with fewer teeth, but with well-developed carnassials and canines.|$|E
25|$|Estrus lasts from 3 to 9 days, {{with older}} cats having shorter cycles. Oncillas produce 1 to 3 kittens (usually only one), after a {{gestation}} of 74 to 76 days. The kittens' eyes open after eight to seventeen days, an unusually long period for a cat of this size. Unlike other cats, {{in which the}} incisor teeth tend to appear first, the teeth of an <b>oncilla</b> kitten erupt more or less simultaneously, at around 21 days of age. The kittens do not begin to take solid food until they are 38 to 56 days old (much older than in the domestic cat), but are fully weaned at three months.|$|E
