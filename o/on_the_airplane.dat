Charlie runs by while being called after by flight attendants before turbulence shakes the plane, scaring Rose, who is sitting across from Jack. The two talk, and Rose mentions that her husband is in the bathroom. The plane gets exceptionally shaky, causing a man to hit the plane's ceiling and oxygen masks to fall.|$|E

25|$|As of 2007, several {{airlines}} {{are experimenting with}} base station and antenna systems installed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>airplane,</b> allowing low power, short-range connection of any phones aboard to remain connected to the aircraft's base station. Thus, they would not attempt connection to the ground base stations as during take off and landing. Simultaneously, airlines may offer phone services to their travelling passengers either as full voice and data services, or initially only as SMS text messaging and similar services. The Australian airline Qantas is the first airline to run a test aeroplane in this configuration {{in the autumn of}} 2007. Emirates has announced plans to allow limited mobile phone usage on some flights. However, in the past, commercial airlines have prevented the use of cell phones and laptops, due to the assertion that the frequencies emitted from these devices may disturb the radio waves contact of the airplane.|$|E

As the third {{dedicated}} fighter squadron of the Aviation Militaire Belge, next to 9ème Escadrille and 10ème Escadrille, {{it was part}} of Belgium's first fighter wing, the Groupe de Chasse. The new unit used an insignia that was adopted from Willy Coppens's personal insignia with his consent. The Cocotte is a two dimensional representation of an origami Chicken, and was painted in white <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>airplanes.</b> <b>The</b> squadron was equipped with castoff Sopwith Camels from 1ère Escadrille de Chasse as well as a few Hanriot-Dupont 1s, and under command of Commander Paul Hiernaux.|$|R

500|$|Bodanzky and Bolognesi {{spent four}} months in Trieste, Italy editing the film along with Italian editors Jacopo Quadri and Letizia Caudullo. However, the film was [...] "dreamed, written and filmed" [...] for Brazilian people, so they then {{returned}} to Brazil {{to listen to their}} opinions. After some screenings in Brazil, they felt the film was not working as they wanted. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> back to Italy, they rewrote the screenplay; they focused more on Neto and removed minor characters and subplots, while emphasizing the son-father relationship. When they arrived they had a long discussion with the Italian producers before finally agreeing and finishing the film. The film was finalized in October at the Cinecittà studio in Rome, using the THX mixing technology and the standard Dolby Digital.|$|E
500|$|It {{took several}} days to film the alien {{abduction}} scene. Internal shots of the airplane's cockpit were filmed in a real flight simulator, separate from the airplane set used {{for the rest of}} the interior shots. The exterior scenes were filmed at Vancouver International Airport. Executive producer John Shiban was asked to write a speech for Garrett in the scene in which Mulder encounters him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>airplane.</b> Inspired by a speech given by Orson Welles in The Third Man, Shiban wrote the monologue as an homage to the film. The scenes of the airplane's final airborne moments included eighty extras who Manners felt were [...] "eighty of the best extras I've ever worked with in my life". Several extras were as young as four years old, leading series creator Chris Carter to note that the scene would benefit from showing younger children, though these were represented by dolls as a safety precaution.|$|E

2500|$|The {{scope of}} the NIST {{investigation}} was focused on identifying [...] "the sequence of events" [...] that triggered the collapse, and did not include {{detailed analysis of the}} collapse mechanism itself (after the point at which events made the collapse inevitable). In line with the concerns of most engineers, NIST focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> impacts and the spread and effects of the fires, modeling these using the software program Fire Dynamics Simulator. NIST developed several highly detailed structural models for specific sub-systems such as the floor trusses as well as a global model of the towers as a whole which is less detailed. [...] These models are static or quasi-static, including deformation but not the motion of structural elements after rupture as would dynamic models. [...] So, the NIST models are useful for determining how the collapse was triggered, but do not shed light on events after that point.|$|E
2500|$|After Alan and Dale both {{graduated}} from college they formed an aircraft company in 1984, which they named [...] "Cirrus Design" [...] (now known as Cirrus Aircraft) in remembrance of a summer drive the brothers had {{a few years back}} where they saw cirrus clouds on the horizon and wished that they were flying. Once they formed the company, the Klapmeiers called upon Alan's old college roommate, Jeff Viken, to help out with their new design: the VK-30 (VK standing for Viken-Klapmeier). Viken was an aeronautical engineer who eventually married another aeronautical engineer, Sally Viken, and the unpaid Cirrus staff grew to four volunteers (with occasional help from the Klapmeiers' high school friend, Scott Ellenberger). The Cirrus VK-30 was a four to five-seat composite pusher with conventional wings and tail. Alan and Dale moved into the family farmhouse to be closer to the project, and began work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> {{in the basement of the}} barn [...] "down where the cows were". They all pitched in with the designing and balanced that with hands-on labor. Jeff designed the airfoil while Sally designed the flap system. The four of them would finish designing a part or a system, build it, and return to designing. Experimental aircraft innovator Moulton Taylor gave the Klapmeiers and Vikens technical advice surrounding the VK-30.|$|E
2500|$|On July 1, The Ike and Tina Turner Revue {{traveled}} by plane to Dallas {{where they were}} to perform at the Dallas Statler Hilton. While <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>airplane,</b> the two became embroiled in an altercation, {{which led to a}} physical fight in their limousine. The duo presented different accounts as to what went on that day. Ike accused Tina of being negligent to help him with a nose bleed due to constant cocaine use. Tina claimed Ike was annoyed that Tina was eating chocolates while wearing an all-white outfit, causing Ike to slap her. The couple agreed, however, that Ike had been up for five days straight on a cocaine binge. Following Ike's slap, Tina recalled fighting him back, scratching him and kicking him. Ike Turner alleged to a musician associate friend that the two [...] "went around like prizefighters for awhile". Both Ike and Tina were bleeding by the time they arrived at the hotel. After going up to their suite, Ike retired to a sofa. Once Ike had fallen asleep, Tina grabbed a few toiletries, covered herself and escaped {{from the back of the}} hotel, running across an active freeway before stopping at a local Ramada Inn hotel. She claimed that she later hid at several friends' homes for a time. [...] Ike claims in his book that Tina initiated the fight by purposely irritating him so that she'd have a reason to break up with him before they were scheduled to sign a new 5-year contract upon their return from Dallas. He reveals that three weeks after they split, they met for a meal at Ship's Restaurant in Los Angeles. Ike says Tina said maybe they'd get back together after eight or nine years. On July 27, 1976, Tina Turner filed for divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences.|$|E
