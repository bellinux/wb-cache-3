500|$|Brett Davinger of The California Literary Review called Brian's antics [...] "creepy", and {{wondered}} if the character would begin to emulate {{the characteristics of the}} eighth season character Cathy, who attempted to cheat with Jim. He called the Jim and Darryl story filler, but was more positive about Oscar and Kevin's story, noting that the ending was [...] "a short segment, but well done". Bonnie Stiernberg of Paste magazine wrote that the idea of Brian temporarily dividing Pam and Jim led to [...] "one of the more <b>out-of-the-box</b> episodes" [...] of the series. However, she felt that the writers should have [...] "thought of [...] sometime last season" [...] and that the concept seemed forced. Stiernberg paralleled the quick buildup to Pam and Brian's relationship unfavorably to the slow buildup of Pam and Jim's initial attraction to each other. Nick Campbell of TV.com wrote that [...] "Vandalism"—along with [...] "Junior Salesman"—was [...] "so much sharper than last week's trial in Dullsville". He felt that the episode was [...] "important", because it continued the plot involving Brian. Campbell initially was not pleased with the development, but said that the plot will be [...] "the ultimate test of the show's romantic theory" [...] that [...] "the meek men (the proletariat) constantly and righteously upending the established and neglectful men (the bourgeoisie) in the lives of The Offices womenfolk".|$|E
