40|$|We {{report a}} {{metalization}} technique for electrically addressing templated vertical single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) using in situ palladium (Pd) nanowires. SWNTs are synthesized from an embedded catalyst in a modified porous anodic alumina (PAA) template. Pd is electrodeposited into the template to form nanowires that grow from an underlying conductive layer beneath the PAA and {{extend to the}} initiation sites of the SWNTs within each pore. In this way, individual vertical channels of SWNTs are created, each with a vertical Pd nanowire back contact. Further Pd deposition results in annular Pd nanoclusters that form on portions of SWNTs extending onto the PAA surface. Two-terminal electrical characteristics produce linear I−V relationships, indicating ohmic contact in the devices.

40|$|SUMMARY: Construction {{workers who}} are exposed to hot and humid environments {{are at high risk}} of heat stress. Excessive {{exposure}} to such environments can result in occupational illnesses and injuries. Acquisition of sensor data from such environments is essential to ensure improved Health and Safety (H&S) of workers. Building Information Modeling (BIM) offers a new epitome to provide comprehensive solutions for H&S and evacuation planning in buildings. Researchers around the globe have presented hybrid solutions for integrating different sensing technologies with BIM such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, Ultra High Frequency (UHF) readers and sensors. A review and critical evaluation of literature on integrated solutions of BIM with various sensing technologies is performed in order to present a hybrid solution based on BIM and Wireless Sensors Network (WSN) along with a notification system for real-time environmental monitoring of buildings. The application, entitled “Real-Time Environmental Monitoring, Visualization and Notification System”, is expected to provide a new horizon for effective visualization, reliable data capturing and catering to time sensitive emergency situations for construction H&S management.

With one excep-tion [3], however, the applications of this failure criterion to date have been for circular holes or cracks oriented normal to an applied uniaxial tensile load [1, 2, 4]. Thus, the effects on failure predictions of substantial combined stresses and mixed-mode fracture have not been thoroughly investigated. Furthermore, no applications of the average stress criterion appear to exist for failure predictions of notched laminates subjected to compressive loadings...|$|R
40|$|How can a {{religion}} be rational and scientific? While formulating my research question {{and preparing for}} my fieldwork among Spiritists in Brazil, that was a recurring question for me. My concern had historical reasons. If for much of nineteenth-century evolutionary thought religion and science were understood to be competitors, {{in the twentieth century}} anthropologists abandoned, for the most part, the idea that religion would be the forerunner of science, a sort of primitive science. Religion was now relegated to a different domain of reality, a matter of inner experience and symbolic meanings. On the other hand, Spiritism takes most of its inspiration from the positivism of Auguste Comte. In this context, Spiritism would be part of the third and last stage of social development proposed by Comte, the positive state, that in which science would be able to explain everything through observation and experimentation. Thus, while it is certainly true that Spiritism is an attempt to carry on this project in the realm of what was traditionally seen as miraculous and unexplainable, it is also the case that these phenomena became more and more excluded from the <b>scope</b> <b>o...</b>|$|R

The coexistence of heart failure and renal dysfunction constitutes the “cardiorenal syndrome ” which is increasingly recognized as a marker of poor prognosis. Patients with cardiorenal dysfunction constitute a large and heterogeneous group where individuals can have markedly different outcomes and disease courses. Thus, the determination of prognosis in this high risk group of patients may pose challenges for clinicians and for researchers alike. In this paper, we discuss the cardiorenal syndrome {{as it pertains to}} the patient with heart failure and considerations for further refining prognosis and outcomes in patients with heart failure and renal dysfunction. Conventional assessments of left ventricular function, renal clearance, and functional status can be complemented with identification of coexistent comorbidities, medication needs, microalbuminuria, anemia, biomarker levels, and pulmonary pressures to derive additional prognostic data that can aid management and provide future research directions for this challenging patient group. 1.

40|$|In the {{tradition}} of formal semantics (e. g., Montague’s PTQ), tense morphemes {{are assumed to be}} sentential operators.

There is some past time t such that every student x at t leaves at t. P is interpreted as a quantifier over past t imes, but t imes are not directly referred to in the object language in PTQ. Each expression is interpreted with respect to a world and a time (called indices), and a tense operator shifts the time index away from the original index. An important empirical prediction that this system makes is that P affects the temporal interpretation of each non-logical constant in its scope. (1 b) is interpreted as in (1 c). In this case, P has scope over STUDENT and LEAVES.
