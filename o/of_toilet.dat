By the mid 14th century during the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368), it was written that ten million packages of 1,000 to 10,000 sheets <b>of</b> <b>toilet</b> paper were manufactured annually in Zhejiang province alone.|$|E
5|$|Both the Dodgers and Braves {{finished}} the regularly scheduled 154-game season tied with records of 86–68, forcing a tie-breaker {{to decide the}} pennant winner. The two teams' managers flipped a coin to decide home field advantage and Dodgers' manager Walt Alston won. The Dodgers opted to play {{the second and third}} (if necessary) games at home, choosing to play Game 1 in Milwaukee. The tie-breaker was scheduled for the 28th, 29th, and the 30th if necessary, which required moving the start of the World Series from September 30 to October 1. The Giants' falling out of the pennant race avoided a potentially disruptive situation involving their home field. Candlestick Park was under construction during the 1959 season and the Giants would not begin play there until 1960. However, Giants vice president Chub Feeney had said earlier in the season that if the Giants won the pennant they would play their World Series home games in Candlestick. Several potential problems were suggested with this move including a lack of seating, lack <b>of</b> <b>toilet</b> facilities, and insufficient access roads to the stadium.|$|E

5|$|Outside urban areas, the redback is {{more often}} found in drier {{habitats}} ranging from sclerophyll forest to desert, even as harsh as the Simpson Desert. It became much more common in urban areas {{in the early decades}} of the 20th century, and is now found in all but the most inhospitable environments in Australia and its cities. It is particularly common in Brisbane, Perth and Alice Springs. The redback spider is commonly found in close proximity to human residences. Webs are usually built in dry, dark, sheltered sites, such as among rocks, in logs, tree hollows, shrubs, old tyres, sheds, outhouses, empty tins and boxes, children's toys or under rubbish or litter. Letterboxes and the undersurface <b>of</b> <b>toilet</b> seats are common sites. Populations can be controlled by clearing these habitats, squashing the spiders and their egg sacs, and using pesticide in outhouses. The CSIRO Division of Entomology recommends against the use of spider pesticides due to their toxicity, and because redbacks are rapid recolonists anyway.|$|E

25|$|A {{simple pit}} latrine uses no water seal and {{collects}} human excreta in a pit or trench. This type <b>of</b> <b>toilet</b> {{can range from}} a simple slit trench to more elaborate systems with seating or squatting pans and ventilation systems. In developed countries they are associated with camping and wilderness areas, whereas they are common in rural or peri-urban areas {{of much of the}} developing world.

In Eastern societies, there is a hole in the floor, over which the user crouches. A roll <b>of</b> <b>toilet</b> paper is usually available. Old corn cobs, leaves, or other types of paper are also used.|$|E

25|$|A {{floating}} toilet {{is essentially}} a toilet on a platform built above or floating on the water. Instead of excreta going into the ground they are collected in a tank or barrel. To {{reduce the amount of}} excreta that needs to hauled to shore, many use urine diversion. The floating toilet was developed for residents without quick access to land or connection to a sewer systems. It is also used in areas subjected to prolonged flooding. The need for this type <b>of</b> <b>toilet</b> is high in areas like Cambodia.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} type <b>of</b> <b>toilet,</b> {{the valve}} closet is now rarely used for water-flush toilet systems. More complicated in design than other toilets, this design has lower reliability {{and is more}} difficult to maintain or repair. The most common use for valve closets is now in portable closets for caravans, camping, trains, and aircraft, where the flushing fluid is recycled. This design is also used in train carriages for use in areas where the waste is allowed to be simply dumped between the tracks (the flushing of such toilets is generally prohibited when the train is in a station).|$|E
25|$|In {{many parts}} of Asia, people {{traditionally}} use the toilet in a squatting position. This applies to defecation and urination by males and females. Therefore, homes and public washrooms have squat toilets, with the toilet bowl installed in the floor. This has the advantages of not needing an additional toilet seat and also being more convenient for cultures where people use water to wash their genitals instead <b>of</b> <b>toilet</b> paper. However, Western-style toilets that are mounted at sitting height and which have a plastic seat have become popular as well. Many public washrooms have both squatting and sitting toilets.|$|E

25|$|In {{the shelf}} style or Flachspüler ("shallow flush") toilet, the bowl is {{designed}} with a receiver shelf {{to hold the}} fecal matter {{out of the water}} prior to flushing (i.e. the feces do not fall directly into standing water). The design prevents the occurrence of any splash-up which commonly happens when fecal matter plunges into the standing water of other toilet designs (although substantial deposits may cause splash-up problems of their own). Examples of this type <b>of</b> <b>toilet</b> can be found in Australia, Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, and some regions of Poland, although it is becoming less common.|$|E
25|$|During normal use, a UDDT {{is just as}} {{hygienic}} {{and safe}} to use as any other type <b>of</b> <b>toilet.</b> However, health aspects {{need to be considered}} during removal and emptying of the urine and feces containers of a UDDT. These health risks during emptying of the feces vault or container are significantly lower when compared to emptying the pit of pit latrines or the buckets of some types of dry toilets without urine diversion. However, the health risks are somewhat higher when compared to a flush toilet where the user does not have to carry out any emptying or maintenance tasks at the household level unless the flush toilet plugs, back-flows or otherwise experiences operating problems.|$|E
25|$|A {{pit latrine}} or pit toilet {{is a type}} <b>of</b> <b>toilet</b> that {{collects}} human feces in {{a hole in the}} ground. They use either no water or one to three liters per flush with pour-flush pit latrines. When properly built and maintained they can decrease the spread of disease by reducing the amount of human feces in the environment from open defecation. This decreases the transfer of pathogens between feces and food by flies. These pathogens are major causes of infectious diarrhea and intestinal worm infections. Infectious diarrhea resulted in about 700,000 deaths in children under five years old in 2011 and 250 million lost school days. Pit latrines are the lowest cost method of separating feces from people.|$|E
40|$|Sexual {{violence}} is a major public health issue, affecting 35 % of women worldwide. Major risk factors for sexual assault include inadequate indoor sanitation {{and the need to}} travel to outdoor toilet facilities. We estimated how increasing the number <b>of</b> <b>toilets</b> in an urban township (Khayelitsha, South Africa) might reduce both economic costs and the incidence and social burden of sexual assault. We developed a mathematical model that links risk of sexual assault to the number of sanitation facilities and the time a woman must spend walking to a toilet. We defined a composite societal cost function, comprising both the burden of sexual assault and the costs of installing and maintaining public chemical toilets. By expressing total social costs {{as a function of the}} number <b>of</b> available <b>toilets,</b> we were able to identify an optimal (i. e., cost-minimizing) social investment in toilet facilities. There are currently an estimated 5600 toilets in Khayelitsha. This results in 635 sexual assaults and US$ 40 million in combined social costs each year. Increasing the number <b>of</b> <b>toilets</b> to 11300 would minimize total costs ($ 35 million) and reduce sexual assaults to 446. Higher toilet installation and maintenance costs would be more than offset by lower sexual assault costs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis shows that the optimal number <b>of</b> <b>toilets</b> exceeds the original allocation <b>of</b> <b>toilets</b> in the township in over 80 % of the 5000 iterations of the model. Improving access to sanitation facilities in urban settlements will simultaneously reduce the incidence of sexual assaults and overall cost to society. Since our analysis ignores the many additional health benefits of improving sanitation in resource-constrained urban areas (e. g., potential reductions in waterborne infectious diseases), the optimal number <b>of</b> <b>toilets</b> identified here should be interpreted as conservative...|$|R
