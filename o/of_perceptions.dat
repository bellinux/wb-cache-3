25|$|To {{those who}} believe that {{consciousness}} entails something more than behaving in all ways conscious, Dennett's view is seen as eliminativist, since it denies the existence of qualia and the possibility of philosophical zombies. However, Dennett is not denying the existence of the mind or of consciousness, only what he considers a naive view of them. The point of contention is whether Dennett's own definitions are indeed more accurate, whether what we think of when we speak <b>of</b> <b>perceptions</b> and consciousness can be understood in terms of nothing more than their effect on behaviour.|$|E

For example, the average Canadian may be perceived as more reserved than his or her American counterpart. Canada and the United States are often inevitably compared as sibling countries, and the perceptions that arise from this oft-held contrast have gone to shape the advertised worldwide identities of both nations: the United States is seen as the rebellious child of the British Crown, forged in the fires of violent revolution; Canada is the calmer offspring of the United Kingdom, known for a more relaxed national demeanour.|$|E

25|$|Justice or {{fairness}} {{refers to}} the idea that an action or decision is morally right, which may be defined according to ethics, religion, fairness, equity, or law. People are naturally attentive to the justice of events and situations in their everyday lives, across a variety of contexts (Tabibnia, Satpute, & Lieberman, 2008). Individuals react to actions and decisions made by organizations every day. An individual's perceptions of these decisions as fair or unfair can influence the individual's subsequent attitudes and behaviors. Fairness is often of central interest to organizations because the implications <b>of</b> <b>perceptions</b> of injustice can impact job attitudes and behaviors at work. Justice in organizations can include issues related to perceptions of fair pay, equal opportunities for promotion, and personnel selection procedures.|$|E

Khan plays Rizwan Khan, a Muslim suffering from mild Asperger syndrome who sets out on a journey across America to meet the country's president, in a role that film scholar Stephen Teo sees as a [...] "symbol of assertive rasa values" [...] and another example of Khan representing NRI identity in global Bollywood. To provide an accurate portrayal of a sufferer without disparagement, Khan spent several months researching his role by reading books, watching videos and talking to people affected by the condition. Upon release, My Name is Khan became one of the highest grossing Bollywood films of all time outside India, and earned Khan his eighth Filmfare Award for Best Actor, equalling the record for the most wins in the category with actor Dilip Kumar. Jay Wesissberg from Variety noted how Khan portrayed the Asperger's sufferer with [...] "averted eyes, springy steps, [...] stuttered repetitions of memorized texts", believing it to have been a [...] "standout performance sure to receive the Autism Society's gold seal of approval".|$|E

40|$|Objective: Few {{studies have}} {{evaluated}} the variability <b>of</b> the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> dyspnea in healthy subjects. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the variability <b>of</b> the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> dyspnea in healthy subjects during breathing against increasing inspiratory resistive loads, as well as to assess the association between the level <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> dyspnea and the level of physical activity. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study involving healthy individuals 16 years of age or older. Subjects underwent inspiratory resistive loading testing, in which the level <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> dyspnea was quantified with the modified Borg scale. We also determined body mass indices (BMIs), assessed maximal respiratory pressures, performed pulmonary function tests, applied the international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ) -long form, and conducted six-minute walk tests (6 MWTs). The level <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> dyspnea was classified as low (Borg score 5). Results: We included 48 healthy subjects in the study. Forty-two subjects completed the test up to a load of 46. 7 cmH 2 O/L/s. The level <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> dyspnea was classified as low, intermediate, and high in 13, 19, and 10 subjects, respectively. The level <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> dyspnea was not significantly associated with age, gender, BMI, IPAQ-long form score, maximal respiratory pressures, or pulmonary function test results. Conclusions: The scores for perceived dyspnea induced by inspiratory resistive loading in healthy subjects presented wide variability. The <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> dyspnea was classified as low in 31 % of the subjects, intermediate in 45 %, and high in 24 %. There was no association between the level <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> dyspnea and the level of physical activity (IPAQ or six-minute walk distance) ...|$|R
