[...] What critics like Horner and Zlosnik claim is that this, rather than creating a conflict, is actually an interplay, another way in which Du Maurier undermines the tropes of the gothic novel, through the combination with the historical romance genre.|$|R

Such code is complex, and is becoming even more so {{with the need to}} operate efficiently on a range of parallel hardware. Motivated by rapid advances in functional programming and compiler technology, this chapter investigates whether a shift in programming paradigm could reduce the complexity of the task. Focusing on contour tree generation as a case study, the chapter makes three contributions. First, it sets out the development of a concise functional implementation of the algorithm. Second, it shows that the sequential functional code can be tuned to match the performance of an imperative implementation, albeit at some cost in code clarity. Third, it outlines new possiblilities for parallelisation using functional tools, and notes similarities between functional abstractions and emerging ideas in extreme-scale visualization...|$|R

40|$|Contemporary Latino {{immigrant}} {{literature from}} the U. S. {{is characterized by}} a vision on identity as unstable and non-essential. The two postmodern and bilingual novels under discussion in this thesis show a salient play with structure and language. I argue that this play supports the conception of identity as unstable and non-essential, and tends to counter the dynamic of stereotyping in society, which marginalizes the Latino immigrant population. The analysis, informed by a postcolonial approach, shows that linguistic and narrative techniques are employed consciously with the aim to render Latino identity in an honest and empathic way. They are meant to give Latino identity a voice in U. S. society and to deconstruct cultural borders and stereotypes that set them aside as essentially ‘different’. The constructed nature of stereotypes is highlighted and the authors <b>opt</b> for a <b>language</b> that reflects the dynamic and instability of Latino identity. Postmodern play is in this case thus politically engaged and serves to give the Latino population a place in the cultural landscape of the U. S. ...|$|R

According to the results, although speakers of both <b>languages</b> <b>opted</b> for the direct level as their most frequently used strategy in their daily interactions, the English speakers used more conventionally indirect strategies than the Persian speakers did, and the Persian speakers used more non-conventionally indirect strategies than the English speakers did.

40|$|Australian {{language}} {{policy has}} been characterised by pendulum swings that reflect changing attitudes towards linguistic and cultural diversity and the ideologies that accompany them. These changes reflect shifting international orientations and local political debate about what constitutes Australian identity. In this presentation I outline some key national policy trends since {{the heyday of the}} National Language Policy (1987). As others have argued, these trends indicate a restrictive focus on the study of languages and reflect the climate of economic rationalism that has dominated the Australian political scene since the 1990 s. By the end of the 1990 s, economic arguments for language learning had become paramount and Australian language policy had swung from valuing linguistic and cultural diversity to an emphasis on English literacy and on educational planning driven by outcomes-based assessment. Dramatic reductions in the number of students <b>opting</b> to study <b>languages</b> other than English (LOTE) in schools have sparked media debate about language learning in which the argument that Asian languages should be studied for economic reasons still carries weight. The state of language learning in Australia and Queensland in particular remains precarious. By way of illustration, I discuss recent policy swings in Queensland which indicate indecision as to the status of LOTE in the curriculum and what are considered to be valid reasons for studying them. I reflect on two recent policy documents to come from Queensland as well as the potential of the new national curriculum to promote language learning...|$|R
40|$|An {{acceptor}} for {{a language}} L is an algorithm that accepts every input in L {{and does not}} stop on every input not in L. An acceptor <b>Opt</b> for a <b>language</b> L is called optimal if for every acceptor A for this language there exists polynomial pA such that for every x ∈ L, the running time timeOpt(x) of Opt on x is bounded by pA(timeA(x) + |x|) for every x ∈ L. (Note that the comparison of the running time is done pointwise, i. e., for every word of the language.) The existence of optimal acceptors is an important open question equivalent {{to the existence of}} p-optimal proof systems for many important languages [KP 89, Sad 99, Mes 99]. Yet no nontrivial examples of languages in NP ∪ co-NP having optimal acceptors are known. In this short note we construct a randomized acceptor for graph nonisomorphism that is optimal up to permutations of the vertices of the input graphs, i. e., its running time on a pair of graphs (G 1, G 2) is at most polynomially larger than the maximum (in fact, even the median) of the running time of any other acceptor taken over all permuted pairs (π 1 (G 1), π 2 (G 2)). One possible motivation is the (pointwise) optimality in the class of acceptors based on graph invariants where the time needed to compute an invariant does not depend much on the representation of the input pair of nonisomorphic graphs. In fact, our acceptor remains optimal even if the running time is compared to the average-case running time over all permuted pairs. We introduce a natural notion of average-case optimality (not depending on the language of graph nonisomorphism) and show that our acceptor remains average-case optimal for any probability distribution on the inputs that respects permutations of vertices...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the way in}} which a selection of the poetry of Elizabeth Barrett Browning (henceforth to be referred to as EBB) exhibits what I will refer to as a poetics of reciprocity. My focus is on EBB’s ballads of the 1830 s and 40 s, her amatory sonnet sequence Sonnets from the Portuguese, and those ballads found in Last Poems. Lyric poetry is, traditionally, said to be defined by a monologic lyric speaker. Mikhail Bakhtin, for instance, pronounced that the mono-stylistic and cohesive nature of poetic language distinguished it from novelistic prose. However, it was, in part, Bakhtin’s insistence that poetry was by definition monologic that triggered my dialogic investigation of EBB’s poetry. Despite the range of work, both formal and temporal, that I consider in these three chapters, the discussion is nevertheless united by a consideration of EBB’s fascination with language, and her concomitant departure from the conventions of the monologic lyric speaker. In her early ballads, I explore EBB’s presentation of unreliable speakers and protagonists. These figures prove elusive to read because of their use of duplicitous or untrustworthy language, or they falter in the act of interpretation themselves. In EBB’s Sonnets from the Portuguese, I consider {{the way in which}} the poet <b>opts</b> for the <b>language</b> of conversation to evoke, in a fresh and powerful manner, the love between her speaker and her beloved. I suggest that this strategy, in part, compensated for the way in which clichéd literary language used to describe the experience of loving had been drained of vigour. Finally, in Last Poems I consider EBB’s presentation of speech as a social act that is influenced by the speaker’s status in society. In these late ballads, women’s attempts to wield language in an effective way are demonstrated to be dependent upon various conditions that reduce or enhance the potency of their speech acts. While Bakhtin’s essay “Discourse in the Novel,” in addition to the work of critics such as E. Warwick Slinn and Marjorie Stone, has been vital to the formulation of my thesis, I have, largely, relied upon a formalist approach to EBB’s poetry. In my close readings I examine EBB’s interrogation of language in her ballads and sonnets in light of her conscientious use, in particular, of metre and rhyme...|$|R
40|$|This special double issue (41. 1 and 41. 2) {{contains}} 11 {{articles on}} the formal properties of linguistic feature systems, {{all of which were}} presented at a conference in Tromsø in the fall of 2013. The issue was jointly edited by Martin Krämer, Sandra Ronai, and Peter Svenonius. A version of the original call for papers posted in 2013 follows. All formal models of linguistics assume sets of features in terms of which generalizations can be stated. But the nature of the features themselves is often not explicitly addressed. In this special double issue of Nordlyd we focus on the nature of features across phonology and syntax and related domains of linguistics.   One group of questions concerns the ‘grounding’ of features in substance or content. For example, phonological features may be grounded in phonetics, and syntactic features may be grounded in semantics. Innatist traditions have sometimes posited innate universal inventories of grounded features. The ‘substance-free’ movement in phonology argues instead that the formal properties of features can and should be radically dissociated from their grounding in content. Sign language phonology would seem to support this position, as the featural system of sign language phonology operates with a completely different set of articulators from those used in spoken languages. Minimalist syntax also frequently promotes the dissociation of formal properties of features from their content (as in the proposal that tense is simply one of a variety of ways in which Infl may be ‘grounded,’ favored in Indo-European languages but with various other <b>languages</b> <b>opting</b> for other content for Infl). Such proposals raise many questions concerning how feature systems are constrained to be uniform across languages and to what extent they are free to vary. The radically opposing view in phonology denies the existence of categorical features altogether and attempts to model phonological patterns as statistical computation of phonetic data. The formal structure of features raises another set of questions. Complex patterns of feature locality gave rise to feature geometries in phonology, and these have been developed further to account for dependencies among features, not only in phonology but also in syntax. Cartographic work typically assumes linear hierarchies. To what extent are the various geometries and hierarchies motivated, and how might they be grounded in a broader explanatory theory? Interacting with these questions about the “geometric” relations among features is the algebraic structure of the features. For example, it is often assumed that privativity, in which opposition is marked by presence versus absence, is conceptually simplest and therefore the zero hypothesis. While in phonology the pendulum currently swings towards privativity, recently arguments have come from morphosyntax that features have binary values. While apparent ternary patterns in phonology have been taken as arguments in favor of binarity, such patterns have more recently been accounted for by reference to class nodes. Theories such as HPSG or Government Phonology assume much more complex relations among features (with HPSG even allowing feature-value matrices in which the values are feature-value matrices, extending to a kind of feature recursion, and GP positing government and licensing relations between features and positions). In this volume, a selection of researchers address these and other questions about the nature of features in linguistic theory...|$|R
