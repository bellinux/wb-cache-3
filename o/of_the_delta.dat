Despite some recent progress, the current institutional landscape for regulation and management of these stressors is still highly fragmented.

5|$|Ryholt's {{hypothesis}} regarding Sheshi {{comes with}} his dating {{the start of}} the 14th Dynasty around 1805 BC, over 90 years earlier than accepted by most Egyptologists. They propose instead that the 14th Dynasty emerged during the two decades of Merneferre Ay's reign, which is dated to between 1700 BC and 1660 BC, depending on the scholar. Ay is the last 13th Dynasty pharaoh to be attested in Lower Egypt, and most scholars therefore contend that he abandoned Itjtawy, the capital of Egypt since the reign of Amenemhat I (c. 1980 BC), in favor of Thebes as he lost control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Delta</b> region to the 14th Dynasty.|$|E
