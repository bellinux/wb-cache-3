50|$|The actual icky-pick {{compound}} is a {{very thick}} petroleum-based substance with very high flammability, and consequently is only rated for outdoor use, frequently direct-buried in the ground. An <b>outdoor</b> <b>cable</b> spliced onto an indoor terminal block is prone to leak the gelatin which is a fire hazard, hence in many situations the icky-pic cable is spliced (usually outside the building) to a short run of normal cable which is run in a protective conduit into the building and then terminated. The thick gelatin stains clothing and hands and {{is very difficult to}} remove.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the most}} common system, {{multiple}} television channels (as many as 500, although this varies depending on the provider's available channel capacity) are distributed to subscriber residences through a coaxial cable, which comes from a trunkline supported on utility poles originating at the cable company's local distribution facility, called the [...] "headend". Many channels can be transmitted through one coaxial cable by a technique called frequency division multiplexing. At the headend, each television channel is translated to a different frequency. By giving each channel a different frequency [...] "slot" [...] on the cable, the separate television signals do not interfere with each other. The main cable meets lines from the subscriber's residence in an <b>outdoor</b> <b>cable</b> box, and either the subscriber's television or a set-top box provided by the cable company translates the desired channel back to its original frequency (baseband), and it is displayed onscreen. Due to widespread cable theft in earlier analog systems, the signals are typically encrypted on modern digital cable systems, and the set-top box must be activated by an activation code sent by the cable company before it will function, which is only sent after the subscriber signs up. If the subscriber fails to pay his bill, the cable company can send a signal to deactivate the subscriber's box, preventing reception.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the implementation of}} a low-cost, data access-efficient, sample and easy to deployment, waterproof, and heatproof <b>outdoor</b> <b>Cable</b> Access Point (CAP) device for ubiquitous network applications. The proposed CAP device is consisted of a cable modem (CM) and a wireless local area network (WLAN) access point (AP) to be integrated inside the chassis of an existing outdoor CATV amplifier. The main purpose of the CAP device is to effectively extend the coverage of outdoor wireless access link and to further provide a data access-efficient service for construction of a ubiquitous networking environment in the metropolitan area. Besides, to ensure the safety and validity for data accessing and information exchanging in the wireless broadband network, a security certifying mechanism of authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) is also integrated in the CAP device. The experimental results show that the performance and robustness of the CAP devices is suitable for ubiquitous network applications...|$|E

40|$|High {{voltage cable}} {{terminations}} {{are widely used}} in power system networks. A proper design of cable termination is essential in reducing the electric field distribution {{around the end of}} high voltage cable. However, if there are defects exist at cable termination structure, the electric field can be enhanced significantly and can be the source of electrical discharges. Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} the effect of defects on the electric field distribution at cable terminations. In this work, a 132 kV XLPE <b>outdoor</b> <b>cable</b> termination has been modelled using finite element analysis (FEA) method. The model has been used to simulate the electric field distribution in the cable termination in the presence of defects. Defects that have been considered are void defect in porcelain, stress cone and fluid, sharp pin on the porcelain surface and delamination defect between the insulator and the stress cone. The effect of different void location, material dielectric constant and porcelain radius on the electric field magnitude at cable termination have also been investigated. From the results obtained in this work, a better understanding of the electric field distribution at the cable termination with defects can be attained...|$|E

25|$|For urban <b>outdoor</b> {{telephone}} <b>cables</b> containing {{hundreds or}} thousands of pairs, the cable is divided into small but identical bundles. Each bundle consists of twisted pairs that have different twist rates. The bundles are in turn twisted together to make up the cable. Pairs having the same twist rate within the cable can still experience some degree of crosstalk. Wire pairs are selected carefully to minimize crosstalk within a large cable.|$|R

40|$|The article {{describes}} simulations of {{the occurrence of}} stray currents {{in the vicinity of}} a SUDOP-type railway platform. Stray currents occur in the vicinity of a railway platform during the passage of a railway vehicle. In a fault-free state, all metallic parts are separated from the rail by means of a surge arrester. In the case of a breakdown of the surge arrester, the full voltage which is on the rail {{at the time of the}} passing railway vehicle may also pass onto the metallic parts. The surge arresters are checked every 6 months during maintenance work on the overhead lines according to Annex No. 1 of SZDC internal regulation E 500. The article, therefore, carries out a simulation of stray currents in exactly this type of breakdown. In addition, to the model, we included the influence of the <b>outdoor</b> lighting <b>cable</b> which is located in the ground under the platform. For the purposes of solving the model, we are using a commercially available program which solves partial differential equations and uses the finite element method for calculation...|$|R

5000|$|Via ferratas have {{continued}} to grow in popularity. In the 1970s and 80s development remained focused on traditional areas (the Dolomites and Northern Limestone Alps). New routes were mostly developed by the climbing community often with active involvement {{of one of the}} relevant Alpine Clubs (although there was occasional controversy and opposition to some new routes). In the 1990s and 2000s, development became more commercial and involved more organisations: via ferratas began {{to be seen as a}} useful way to encourage tourism and increase the range of activities available to visitors, and so new routes were developed by local communities, <b>outdoor</b> activity centres, <b>cable</b> car companies, mountain refuges and others, as well as continuing involvement by the Alpine clubs. Development of via ferratas has spread out of its original areas to the rest of the Alps and beyond. The first via ferratas in France were constructed in 1988; by 2003 there were 100. While high mountain via ferratas {{have continued}} to be developed, the modern era has seen the rise of more [...] "sporting" [...] routes, sometimes closer to the valley and often more challenging in nature, with severely steep sections and requiring high strength. Routes have been built in new dramatic new locations, alongside waterfalls or in canyons. Other new routes include features such as wire bridges and even zip wires, designed to increase their appeal to visitors. Climbing via ferratas has come to be recognised as a valid mountain activity in own right, with its own guidebooks, equipment, grading system and enthusiasts.|$|R
