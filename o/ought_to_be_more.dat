25|$|Next to {{the study}} of the Scriptures which I earnestly inculcate, I exhort my pupils to peruse Calvin’s Commentaries, which I extol in loftier terms than Helmich himself (a Dutch divine, 15511608); for I affirm that he excels beyond {{comparison}} in the interpretation of Scripture, and that his commentaries <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> highly valued than all that is handed down to us by the library of the fathers; so that I acknowledge him to have possessed above most others, or rather above all other men, what may be called an eminent spirit of prophecy. His Institutes ought to be studied after the (Heidelberg) Catechism, as containing a fuller explanation, but with discrimination, like the writings of all men.|$|E
