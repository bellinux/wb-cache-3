500|$|Speaking at an April 2008 {{event in}} New York, Byrne {{confirmed}} {{the release of}} a new album, calling it a [...] "record of sung songs" [...] in contrast to the experimental music from MyLifeintheBushofGhosts and later told the NewYorkDailyNews that [...] "Brian had written a lot of music, but needed some words, which I know how to do. What's it sound like? Electronicgospel. That's all I'm saying." [...] Eno also explained the differences between this album and their previous one saying, [...] "his is quite different from MyLife in that the intention of that album was to not use <b>our</b> <b>voices</b> at all, but instead to find voices and stick them on to the music. This new one is different—these are songs written and sung by David... They go from electronic folkgospel to quite indefinable areas of music." ...|$|E
500|$|Martin Olson, {{the father}} of voice actress Olivia Olson, reprises his role as Hunson Abadeer in this episode, as well as [...] "Daddy's Little Monster"; Olson had {{previously}} appeared in the second season premiere [...] "It Came from the Nightosphere" [...] and the third season episode [...] "Memory of a Memory". The episode {{was also the first}} to give a name to Marceline's father: Hunson Abadeer. According to Moynihan, the name was inspired by the name that his brother had given their family's car when they were growing up. The two later used it for a band that only recorded one song. To create the demonic effect of Marceline talking while possessed with the amulet, Olivia Olson and her father were required to say their lines in tandem. She later explained: [...] "We were going back-and-forth, line to line … We were screaming back and forth at each other, and trying to match pitches and stuff. Then, hearing the after product of both of <b>our</b> <b>voices</b> blended together was pretty fun." ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{the construction of}} <b>our</b> VoiceXMLcompliant <b>voice</b> browser that is able to interpret and execute VoiceXML documents. The platform of <b>our</b> <b>voice</b> browser contains a VoiceXML interpreter, a speech recognition (SR) engine, a text-to-speech (TTS) engine, and a computertelephony-integrated (CTI) user interface. We adopt an open source called OpenVXI as the VoiceXML interpreter. Our main effort for developing the voice browser is to incorporate OpenVXI with our SR, TTS, and CTI modules. In order to test whether <b>our</b> <b>voice</b> browser conforms to the VoiceXML specifications we build three VoiceXML applications including stock quotes querying, automatic call-transfer, and news-reading systems. Besides, we develop a system that allows users to register their own VoiceXML documents in <b>our</b> <b>voice</b> gateway system via Web. They may then call to <b>our</b> <b>voice</b> gateway system and browse their VoiceXML documents by using <b>our</b> <b>voice</b> browser. 1...|$|R

2500|$|Nick Rawlinson {{agrees with}} England's assessment, {{although}} {{he feels that}} Samuel Foote {{may have been more}} of an influence than England allows for. Rawlinson reads the piece as primarily about reading itself, and the social implications of certain types of reading; [...] "inside the apparently random concoction of prose, song and slapstick [...] lies an extraordinary, almost dazzling examination of the relationship between our habits of reading and the society they produce [...] Blake consistently and consciously foregrounds how our understanding of our society, <b>our</b> <b>voices</b> and even our perceptions are governed by our habits of reading [...] An Island contains a deliberate and careful plan to challenge [...] misreadings by teaching us how to read the world comically. It is nothing less than a degree course in comic Vision." [...] Rawlinson argues that the literary references in the text are structured to mirror a 1707 Cambridge University pamphlet entitled A Method of Instructing Pupils (a guide on how to teach Philosophy). As such Rawlinson feels An Island is best described as [...] "philosoparody." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June five adult actresses {{met with}} Hall's {{district}} director, Heather Hutt, at the legislator's office on Artesia Boulevard in Compton and presented 650 signed petitions asking that the Assemblyman withdraw his [...] "condoms in porn" [...] bill. At {{the meeting with}} Hutt were adult film actresses Nina Hartley, Alex Chance and Anikka Albrite, along with industry newcomers Mia Li and Charli Piper and Michael Stabile, a publicist {{who has been working}} with Free Speech Coalition (FSC) and Kink.com on the issue. The group expressed their disappointment with the bill {{and the fact that it}} had been created with no input from adult industry representatives. In an interview with AVN magazine, Chance stated the following,"We told [...] we have our own self-regulation..." [...] "We told her we wanted to have <b>our</b> <b>voices</b> heard. They'd had no performer input on this. About condoms and chafing and micro-tears, it didn't seem like she really knew all the details of that. She compared it to a dentist being forced to wear gloves, and maybe it's a little uncomfortable. She didn't realize why we have to have sex from 45 minutes to an hour, sometimes longer, and why that was necessary. She didn't know that the dangers of it, like if the condom breaks, and that we could get more STI's with the micro-tears, and just the condoms in general: Swelling, yeast infections, things of that nature—she just had no idea." [...] "She also didn't know about the doctors with the FSC that help make the decisions," [...] Chance added. [...] "It's not just a couple of people in a building making decisions for the whole industry. They don't even make decisions on the moratoriums; a doctor does, and she had no idea about that and what the testing protocols—how the doctors work with them to make the most safe tests available; she had no idea." ...|$|E
