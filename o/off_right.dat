Several scenes display the singer loitering around a shopping centre, dancing in a nightclub, and driving around the city at night. He is also shown dancing with various female companions and hugging {{a few of his}} friends. The visual ends with Iyanya drinking vodka around the aforementioned ladies.

On December 26, Marc-Andre Fleury made 37saves in Pittsburgh's first shutout of the season, defeating the New Jersey Devils, 1–0.

500|$|The Lake District {{receives}} over 12million {{visitors a}} year, {{many of whom}} come to climb the mountains. The closest villages to Nethermost Pike are Glenridding and Patterdale, [...] to the east, close to the shores of Ullswater. Both are common starting points for climbing Nethermost Pike or other fells in the Helvellyn range. The best ascents from the east is the east ridge, reached either from the path to Eagle Crag Mine, or via Ruthwaite Lodge and Hard Tarn. There are no settlements of note close to Nethermost Pike to the west, and many walkers start from a car park at Wythburn, close to Wythburn Church. This is a popular route which follows a wide track to Helvellyn before branching <b>off</b> <b>right</b> at Swallow Scarth. Alternatives are possible on the smooth flanks of the fell, but all are pathless.|$|E

500|$|The {{recording}} of Evergreen {{started at the}} beginning of 1997 when Echo & the Bunnymen entered Doghouse Studios in Henley-on-Thames. The production of the album was undertaken by McCulloch and Paul Toogood, the band's new manager, although it was credited to the band in the liner notes to the album. With Oasis in the next studio, Liam Gallagher contributed backing vocals to the track [...] "Nothing Lasts Forever". McCulloch said, [...] "We just hit it <b>off</b> <b>right</b> away, and after a few beers he ended up singing on the record." [...] McCulloch also said that Gallagher [...] "insisted we put tambourine on [...] " [...] which [...] "took [...] to another level". Adam Peters, who had previously worked on the band's 1984 album Ocean Rain, was brought in to provide string arrangements for the album. Using musicians from the London Metropolitan Orchestra, Peters recorded string passages for seven tracks from the album at Abbey Road Studios in London. With Clif Norrell, who had previously worked with R.E.M., finishing the mixing of the album, the recording was completed by the end of March 1997.|$|E
500|$|Lexie entertained several {{relationships}} {{throughout her}} time on Grey's Anatomy. In her early appearances, she maintained {{a friendship with}} George O'Malley, until developing romantic feelings towards him. Rhimes offered the insight: [...] "I love them as friends. They make good friends. We all have that friend we met in school or the gym or somewhere – we just hit it <b>off</b> <b>right</b> away. And right away there was no pretense or airs. Just pure honesty. That's Lexie and George. They’re really good friends and I can see the friendship evolving into something even greater. At least, that's what Lexie is hoping. She is my kind of girl. The girl who likes the guy {{because he is a}} GOOD guy and that's what George is. He is a good guy and that's something that Lexie could use now. She's going through her own challenges what with Meredith and losing her own mother and trying to keep things afloat. I’m rooting for Lexie. She's my kind of girl and I hope that she gets what she deserves: love. And more kisses. There should always be that." [...] Lexie's most significant relationship was with Mark Sloan. Following her death, Rhimes said: ...|$|E
500|$|Knight felt a {{parallel}} to George in that his [...] "confidence isn't always at its absolute highest", but overall he sees more differences than similarities. However, when the actor starts {{to think he}} is so different from O'Malley, an awkward move can suggest otherwise. [...] "I was walking, doing a scene with Katherine Heigl. I finished my line with her, and then I walked straight into the light stand." [...] Critical of her affair with O'Malley, Knight's co-star Heigl explained: [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn't {{seem to be taking}} a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it." [...] Speaking of O'Malley's relationship with Lexie, Rhimes offered her insight: [...] "I love them as friends. They make good friends.

2500|$|With Shemp gone, Moe {{suggested}} that Curly fill {{the role of}} the third Stooge.

Curly left the room and returned minutes later with his head shaven (the mustache remained very briefly). Healy quipped, [...] "Boy, don't you look girlie?" [...] Moe misheard the joke as [...] "curly," [...] and all who witnessed the exchange realized that the nickname [...] "Curly" [...] would be a perfect fit. In one of the few interviews Curly gave in his lifetime, he complained about the loss of his hair: [...] "I had to shave it <b>off</b> <b>right</b> down to the skin." [...] In 1934, MGM was building Healy up as a solo comedian in feature films and Healy dissolved the act to pursue his own career. Like Shemp, the team of Howard, Fine, and Howard was tired of Healy's alcoholism and abrasiveness and renamed their act the [...] "Three Stooges."

In the video Big Sean is wearing a turban-styled headpiece as he raps first. At the end of the clip a Lamborghini Gallardo moves past the screen and the artists are gone from the scene after it passes by.
