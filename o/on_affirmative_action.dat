5|$|Heins {{discusses}} the Supreme Court case Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, a landmark <b>on</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> for minority students in university and college admissions. The case (decided in 1978) upheld {{affirmative action in}} the admission of minority students as one of several factors to consider, not the primary one. In the lawsuit, the affirmative-action standards at UC Davis School of Medicine were challenged; the school had a policy of holding 16 out of 100 slots for minorities in the incoming class of students, regardless of qualification. Potential student Allan Bakke, a qualified white applicant, challenged the practice after he {{was rejected by the}} school. In an opinion written by Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., the court ruled against racial quotas at the school while allowing minority status to remain one of several criteria in the admissions process.|$|E

However, the emphasis on improving the lot of the Malays greatly worried the non-Malays, and when the Third Malaysia Plan was launched, the government toned down its rhetoric <b>on</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> and emphasised greater economic growth, which would benefit all.|$|E

By August 1972, only 534 minority workers had received training and only 34 had received union cards under the New York Plan.

500|$|Perot campaigned in California in mid-June, {{and held}} a rally {{attended}} by 7,000 in Sacramento where he was heckled by some who chanted [...] "Talk about the issues!" [...] He privately spoke with black and Asian leaders in Los Angeles to discuss race relations following the L.A. race riots; afterwards, he gave a speech to a mostly white audience in Orange County about race relations, but did not take a stand <b>on</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action.</b> Perot finished his California campaign swing in Irvine before traveling to events in Colorado and Massachusetts. At {{the end of the}} month, large nominating conventions were held in Washington and other states to put together the final pieces to include Perot on the ballot. Perot addressed the conventions, largely made up of [...] "well dressed, middle aged" [...] individuals, and spoke of improving the education system and restoring the America [...] "where you leave the doors unlocked". As June came to a close, speculation arose that Perot was planning a National Convention to follow the Democratic and Republican National Conventions.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{estimates}} {{the effects of}} statewide <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> bans <b>on</b> graduation rates within colleges and on the fraction of college entrants who become graduates of selective institutions. <b>On</b> net, <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> bans lead to fewer underrepresented minorities becoming graduates of selective colleges. Although the graduation rates for underrepresented minority groups at selective institutions rise when <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> is banned, {{this may be due}} to the changing composition of students at these universities. Moreover, this effect is small relative to the number displaced from selective universities due to <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> bans...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an alternative approach}} to measuring the impact of <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> <b>on</b> firms. <b>Affirmative</b> <b>action</b> is modeled {{as a series of}} hiring quotas. If the quotas are binding, then a firm subject to <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> will operate with greater costs of production, have less elastic demand for inputs, and be less able to substitute between most inputs. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that affirmative-action regulations significantly constrain firms' behavior. Own-wage elasticities are less elastic and most inputs are less substitutable for constrained firms. Further, <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> raises costs by 6. 5 percent for firms subject to the program. Copyright 1992 by MIT Press. ...|$|R

500|$|Although current PRC {{minority}} policy, {{which is}} based <b>on</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>actions,</b> has reinforced a Uyghur ethnic identity that is distinct from the Han population, some scholars argue that Beijing unofficially favours a monolingual, monocultural model {{that is based on}} the majority. The authorities also crack down on any activity that appears to constitute separatism. These policies, in addition to long-standing cultural differences, have sometimes resulted in [...] "resentments" [...] between Uyghur and Han citizens. On one hand, as a result of Han immigration and government policies, Uyghurs' freedoms of religion and of movement are curtailed, while most Uyghurs argue that the government downplays their history and traditional culture. On the other hand, some Han citizens view Uyghurs as benefiting from special treatment, such as preferential admission to universities and exemption from the one-child policy, and as [...] "harbouring separatist aspirations".|$|R

2500|$|Bennett {{tends to}} take a {{conservative}} position <b>on</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action,</b> school vouchers, curriculum reform, and religion in education.

5000|$|In some {{countries}} that have laws <b>on</b> racial equality, <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> is rendered illegal {{because it does not}} treat all races equally.

2500|$|In March 2001, U.S. District Court Judge Bernard A.

50|$|The new {{phenomenon}} of white poverty is often blamed <b>on</b> the government's <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> employment legislation, which reserves 80% {{of new jobs}} for black people and favours companies owned by black people (see Black Economic Empowerment).
