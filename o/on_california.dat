5|$|In most cases, {{rainfall}} is {{the only}} effect that these cyclones have <b>on</b> <b>California.</b> Sometimes, the rainfall is severe enough to cause flooding and damage. For example, floods from Hurricane Kathleen devastated Ocotillo, California and killed several people. Precipitation other than rainfall is unusual in tropical cyclones, because of their weak updrafts and lack of supercooled water.|$|E

5|$|There {{were also}} {{women in the}} Gold Rush. However, their numbers were small. Of the 40,000 people who arrived by ship in the San Francisco harbor in 1849, only 700 were women. They held various roles {{including}} prostitutes, single entrepreneurs, married women, poor and wealthy women. They were of various ethnicities including Anglo-American, African-American, Hispanic, Native, European, Chinese, and Jewish. The reasons they came varied: some came with their husbands, refusing {{to be left behind}} to fend for themselves, some came because their husbands sent for them, and others came (singles and widows) for the adventure and economic opportunities. On the trail many people died from accidents, cholera, fever, and myriad other causes, and many women became widows before even setting eyes <b>on</b> <b>California.</b> While in California, women became widows quite frequently due to mining accidents, disease, or mining disputes of their husbands. Life in the goldfields offered opportunities for women to break from their traditional work.|$|E

25|$|The concern {{felt by the}} Sierra Club's Santa Lucia Chapter lies in the {{management}} of the Oceano Dunes State Vehicular Recreation Area. Off-road vehicle use partially conflicts with habitat of the western snowy plover (Charadrius nivosus) and it is alleged that this directly correlates with a decrease in reproductive success. However, western snowy plover nests have increased dramatically from 16 nests in 1993 to a total of 172 nests in 2011. An eight-year summary of western snowy plover reproduction <b>on</b> <b>California</b> State Park lands depicts the breeding success at Oceano Dunes which is particularly stark compared to very low breeding numbers elsewhere in the state. The western snowy plover was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) on March 5, 1993.|$|E

Two fires occurred in El Centro with the loss of a trailer being reported, though fire was avoided near the Imperial County Airport when a 60,000 barrel gasoline tank farm was seriously damaged and was losing [...] a minute. Firefighters drained the tanks and replaced the fuel with water to avoid the gasoline vapor from causing a hazard.|$|E
