5|$|The {{peace with}} Britain {{proved to be}} uneasy and controversial. Britain did not {{evacuate}} Malta as promised and protested against Bonaparte's annexation of Piedmont and his Act <b>of</b> <b>Mediation,</b> which established a new Swiss Confederation. Neither of these territories were covered by Amiens, but they inflamed tensions significantly. The dispute culminated in {{a declaration of war}} by Britain in May 1803; Napoleon responded by reassembling the invasion camp at Boulogne.|$|E
5|$|Walsingham {{advocated}} {{direct intervention}} in the Netherlands {{in support of the}} Protestant revolt against Spain, on the grounds that although wars of conquest were unjust, wars in defence of religious liberty and freedom were not. Cecil was more circumspect and advised a policy <b>of</b> <b>mediation,</b> a policy that Elizabeth endorsed. Walsingham was sent on a special embassy to the Netherlands in 1578, to sound out a potential peace deal and gather military intelligence.|$|E
5|$|When {{war broke}} out between France and its rivals, Russian and Austrian forces invaded Switzerland. The Swiss refused to fight {{alongside}} the French {{in the name of}} the Helvetic Republic. In 1803 Napoleon organised a meeting of the leading Swiss politicians from both sides in Paris. The result was the Act <b>of</b> <b>Mediation</b> which largely restored Swiss autonomy and introduced a Confederation of 19 cantons. Henceforth, much of Swiss politics would concern balancing the cantons' tradition of self-rule with the need for a central government.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{had shown}} {{independence}} in political matters {{as early as}} 1255, when he sided with the Soler family in Gascony, in the ongoing conflict between the Soler and Colomb families. This ran contrary to his father's policy <b>of</b> <b>mediation</b> between the local factions. In May 1258, a group of magnates drew up a document for reform of the King’s government – the so-called Provisions of Oxford – largely directed against the Lusignans. Edward stood by his political allies and strongly opposed the Provisions. The reform movement succeeded in limiting the Lusignan influence, however, and gradually Edward's attitude started to change. In March 1259, he entered into a formal alliance {{with one of the}} main reformers, Richard de Clare, Earl of Gloucester. Then, on 15October 1259, he announced that he supported the barons' goals, and their leader, Simon de Montfort.|$|E
5|$|Farmer's wife Rebecca {{filed for}} divorce on April 5, 2011, {{claiming}} in court documents {{that she had no}} access to the family's finances except the salary she earned as a teacher's aide. On April 12, Farmer petitioned the court to dismiss his wife's divorce petition, contesting the idea that their marriage was irretrievably broken. The divorce proceedings were put on hold by mutual consent on May 26, 2011, but in a July 12 hearing, Farmer's wife asked that the judge schedule a trial date; the judge ordered mediation within 30 days instead. The mediation failed, and a trial date was set for November 22, shortly after the gubernatorial election. A second round <b>of</b> <b>mediation</b> shortly before the scheduled hearing resulted in a settlement between the parties; terms of the settlement were kept private.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the guise}} of {{reinforcing}} the Spanish armies, 23,000 French troops entered Spain unopposed in November 1807. Even when their intentions became clear the following February, the occupying forces faced little resistance besides isolated actions in disconnected areas. In 1808, a popular uprising—incited by Ferdinand's supporters—saw Godoy captured and left Charles with {{no choice but to}} abdicate; he did so on 19 March 1808, allowing his son to ascend the throne as FerdinandVII. Ferdinand had been seeking French patronage, but Napoleon and his principal commander, Marshal Joachim Murat, believed that Spain would benefit from rulers who were more progressive and competent than the Bourbons. They decided that Napoleon's brother, Joseph Bonaparte, should be king. Under a pretext <b>of</b> <b>mediation,</b> Napoleon summoned Charles and Ferdinand to Bayonne, France, where they were coerced into relinquishing their rights to the throne in favour of Joseph.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{increase}} the understanding of, and extend the knowledge about realization <b>of</b> <b>mediations</b> and its consequences on family law divisions and family centres. Within this area, organisational, methodical, relational and social preventative aspects <b>of</b> <b>mediations</b> were illustrated. This scope was judged to be of major importance, as recent studies show that children often suffer psychologically due to parents’ lack <b>of</b> cooperation. <b>Mediations</b> are considered as a way of getting parents to agree. To fulfil the purpose, six qualitative interviews were conducted, three on each function. A multidimensional tool for interpretation was used, containing organization analysis, social constructionist theories, system theories with focus on roles, and a cognitive perspective. Several important circumstances concerning mediations could be identified, like the importance of flexibility and voluntariness, focus on the children, combination <b>of</b> <b>mediations</b> and complimentary parental support and also the importance of meeting families on an early stage. The results showed that mediations are a preventative way of working with families with children, and that family centres are considered to have greater possibilities <b>of</b> designing <b>mediations</b> according to the above-mentioned circumstances. Furthermore it was showed that mediations are a functional way of recreating the characteristic of the nuclear family triad mother-father-child...|$|R

5|$|A committee, {{headed by}} Thorpe, was {{established}} to recruit employees and headquartered itself at Labor Hall. Throughout September and October, many employees began to join the union, but the Terminal and Traction Company responded by firing employees who joined and refused to recognize the union. After the failure of their initial attempt to have the union recognized by the company, the committee petitioned the United States Department of Labor to mediate discussions {{between them and the}} management of the business. On October 27, 1913, the department offered Ethelbert Stewart, head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to mediate. To begin negotiations, the workers' committee submitted a list of grievances to the company and Stewart. The company, however, refused his services, denied there was a labor problem and said no attempt at unionizing was being made. They insisted that only a small minority of workers were behind the troubles and alleged that it was outside influences behind the unionizing effort. In a later report, the Department of Labor claimed that had their offer <b>of</b> <b>mediation</b> been accepted, the subsequent strike and riot could have been averted.|$|E
5|$|The {{enhanced}} {{police presence}} {{throughout the city}} during the strike helped to keep the calm, and the restrained approach of the police officers generally won praise from all sides, {{even though many of}} the policemen were seen as sympathetic to the striking white workers. The administration of Philadelphia's Republican mayor Bernard Samuel was also seen as quietly sympathetic to the strikers. Throughout the strike, Mayor Samuel, who was {{also a member of the}} PTC board of directors, avoided any attempts <b>of</b> <b>mediation.</b> He refused to call a meeting of the PTC board of directors or to discuss the crisis with the TWU leaders. The mayor denied police protection to the two TWU officials who were willing to travel throughout the city and advocate an end to the strike. Samuel also refused to grant air time to War Production Board representatives who wanted to make a radio plea to end the strike. On August 2, the mayor declined, without an explanation, the NAACP request for permission to send two sound-trucks into black neighborhoods to broadcast appeals for calm. The city's black population felt disappointed and disenchanted with the actions of the local administration.|$|E

40|$|Previous studies {{argue that}} the {{cumulation}} <b>of</b> <b>mediations</b> generally decreases uncertainty and ultimately helps to solve a conflict peacefully. Yet the empirical evidence for this is inconclusive, suggesting that existent theoretical accounts might be incomplete. For addressing this shortcoming, the paper develops an argument for a curvilinear relationship between the cumulation <b>of</b> <b>mediations</b> and mediation effectiveness. Based upon this rationale, it is less likely that initial mediation attempts succeed, but-after a turning point has been reached-subsequent mediations {{are more likely to}} induce an effective resolution of a dispute. The author also argues that this effect should be stronger if the same actors mediate {{over the course of a}} conflict. The empirical implications of this theoretical revision are tested in a quantitative framework employing data for 1816 - 2001. The results provide strong support for the theory. © The Author(s) 2013...|$|R

This conclusion, however, would be inaccurate. Arguments for the greater use <b>of</b> workplace <b>mediation</b> as a way of improving workplace relations by moving to more informal approaches and tackling the numbers of employees who seek resolution through formal systems have been present in policy debates for decades. Despite this, just 7 % of workplaces indicated that they have experience <b>of</b> workplace <b>mediation</b> (in the twelve months prior to the survey) (van Wanrooy et al, 2013 : 27).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{introduce}} the <b>mediation</b> as one <b>of</b> the methods of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). The main reason for choosing this topic was topicality of issues because {{in the last years}} the mediation has been developing in our country. A relatively recent adoption <b>of</b> The <b>Mediation</b> Act No. 202 / 2012 Sb., which is effective since 1 st September 2012, contributed to this development. The thesis involves seven chapters that are further subdivided. In the Chapter One, basic information relating to an alternative dispute resolution are summarized. Characteristic features are shown there and there are more details of each method of ADR. Chapter Two examines basic characteristic <b>of</b> the <b>mediation</b> as a method of ADR. This chapter consists of four subchapters that analyze in more detail historical development <b>of</b> the <b>mediation,</b> basic characteristic features <b>of</b> the <b>mediation,</b> basic principles <b>of</b> the <b>mediation</b> and finally also advantages and disadvantages <b>of</b> the <b>mediation.</b> The status <b>of</b> the mediator is discussed in the Chapter Three of this thesis. The main focus is on the question of impartiality and independence of the mediator, as well as its duty of confidentiality.
