25|$|In August2010, a {{tropical}} wave {{in the eastern}} Atlantic contributed {{to the formation of}} Hurricane Danielle; Danielle eventually tracked west and then northward before dissipating south of Newfoundland after ten days. However, the southern portion of the disturbance became disassociated with Danielle's development and tracked west into Northern South America, reaching the East Pacific on August29. Thunderstorm activity was confined over Central America until September2, when showers developed <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> the Gulf of Tehuantepec. The National Hurricane Center(NHC) first assessed a low probability of tropical cyclogenesis at 00:00UTC the following day.|$|E

Against the Baltimore Orioles in the 2012 ALDS, Ichiro ran home on a ball hit by Robinson Can√≥. Despite the ball beating him to the plate, Orioles catcher Matt Wieters had difficulty tagging Ichiro, who evaded multiple tag attempts by jumping <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> Wieters. In Game 1 of the 2012 ALCS, Ichiro hit his first career postseason home run; however, the Yankees lost the series to the Detroit Tigers in only 4 games.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, the Tornado F3 {{was one of}} {{the assets}} used in Operation Telic, Britain's {{contribution}} to the Iraq War. An expeditionary force composed of 43 and 111 Squadrons (known as Leuchars Fighter Wing) was deployed to the region to carry out offensive counter-air operations. The Tornado F3's of Leuchars Fighter Wing operated all over Iraq, including missions <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> Baghdad, throughout Operation Telic. Due to a lack of airborne threats materialising in the theatre, the F3s were withdrawn and returned to European bases that same year.|$|E

25|$|Love Canal {{was one of}} {{the most}} widely known {{examples}} of groundwater pollution. In 1978, residents of the Love Canal neighborhood in upstate New York noticed high rates of cancer and an alarming number of birth defects. This was eventually traced to organic solvents and dioxins from an industrial landfill that the neighborhood had been built <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>around,</b> which had then infiltrated into the water supply and evaporated in basements to further contaminate the air. Eight hundred families were reimbursed for their homes and moved, after extensive legal battles and media coverage.|$|E
25|$|The {{restored}} Alpha Jet force {{have been}} routinely employed in combat air patrols, and has conducted multiple {{air strikes against}} Boko Haram militants {{over a number of}} years. In September 2014, multiple Alpha Jets conducted a large number of aerial bombardment missions <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> the area of Bama, Borno State, during the fight to regain the city following the withdrawal of friendly ground forces. In early October 2014, Boko Haram released a video containing the decapitation of who they claimed was a captured Nigerian Air Force pilot of a downed Alpha Jet. In March 2016, attacks performed by Nigerian Alpha Jets had reportedly dislodged Boko Haram fighters from Sambisa Forest, Borno State.|$|E
25|$|This {{is often}} highly {{emphasized}} by spectators and novice vaulters, {{but it is}} arguably the easiest phase of the vault and {{is a result of}} proper execution of previous phases. This phase mainly consists of the vaulter pushing off the pole and releasing it so it falls away from the bar and mats. As the torso goes <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> the bar, the vaulter is facing the bar. Rotation of the body over the bar occurs naturally, and the vaulter's main concern is making sure that their arms, face and any other appendages do not knock the bar off as they go over. The vaulter should land near the middle of the foam landing mats, or pits, face up.|$|E

25|$|The {{southwest}} area of {{the hill}} fort is apparently built <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> preceding Bronze Age burial mounds or tumuli. Part of the inner ditch is occupied by a large circular barrow, which was excavated, but was found empty. A few feet further to the west are two other barrows, over which the great inner rampart passes; these on opening, proved to be sepulchral: in the largest was found a cist containing burned human bones at the depth of two feet; and in the smallest, two skeletons were found, lying from south to north, {{the head of the}} smallest reclining on the breast of the other. On the breast of the largest skeleton there was a small ring or bead of stone, which was probably worn as an amulet.|$|E
25|$|A {{soldier in}} Hancock's {{division}} reported {{movement in the}} Confederate line that led some {{to believe that the}} enemy might be retreating. Despite the unlikeliness of this supposition, the V Corps division of Brig. Gen. Andrew A. Humphreys was ordered to attack and capitalize on the situation. Humphreys led his first brigade on horseback, with his men moving <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> fallen troops with fixed bayonets and unloaded rifles; some of the fallen men clutched at the passing pant legs, urging their comrades not to go forward, causing the brigade to become disorganized in their advance. The charge reached to within 50 yards before being cut down by concentrated rifle fire. Brig. Gen. George Sykes was ordered to move forward with his V Corps regular army division to support Humphreys's retreat, but his men were caught in a crossfire and pinned down.|$|E
25|$|The {{commander}} of the II Corps, Maj. Gen. Darius N. Couch, was dismayed at the carnage wrought upon his two divisions in the hour of fighting and, like Col. Miles, realized that the tactics were not working. He first considered a massive bayonet charge to overwhelm the defenders, but as he surveyed the front, he quickly realized that French's and Hancock's divisions were in no shape to move forward again. He next planned for his final division, commanded by Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard, to swing {{to the right and}} attempt to envelop the Confederate left, but upon receiving urgent requests for help from French and Hancock, he sent Howard's men <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> the fallen troops instead. The brigade of Col. Joshua Owen went in first, reinforced by Col. Norman J. Hall's brigade, and then two regiments of Brig. Gen. Alfred Sully's brigade. The other corps in Sumner's grand division was the IX Corps, and he sent in one of its divisions under Brig. Gen. Samuel Sturgis. After two hours of desperate fighting, four Union divisions had failed in the mission Burnside had originally assigned to one. Casualties were heavy: II Corps losses for the afternoon were 4,114, Sturgis's division 1,011.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} connect the eastern and western {{divisions}} of the railroad at this time divided by the unfinished Blue Ridge Railroad, a temporary track over Rockfish Gap was proposed by the railroad's chief engineer, Charles Ellet, Jr., and by 1854 had been constructed and was in use. [...] Built <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> the under construction Blue Ridge Tunnel, this [...] track, called the Mountain Track, included steep grades (maximum 5.6% with a ruling grade of 5.3%) and sharp curves (minimum radius of [...] ), thereby limiting speeds to around [...] [...] Three small tank locomotives were ordered for the temporary track, {{one of which was}} supplied by the Tredegar Iron Works of Richmond, the Joseph R. Anderson, and two from Baldwin Locomotive Works of Philadelphia, the Baldwin and C.R. Mason. [...] A second temporary track [...] around the Brooksville Tunnel and a third [...] around Robertson's hollow were also constructed. [...] The temporary tracks successfully joined the railroad and by eliminating the extra cost and effort of removing freight and passengers from trains for transport over the mountains, facilitated further growth and expansion westward.|$|E
500|$|A {{separate}} model, approximately [...] long, {{was created}} for the Nostromo underside from which the Narcissus would detach and from which Kane's body would be launched during the funeral scene. Bower carved Kane's burial shroud out of wood; it was launched through the hatch using a small catapult and filmed at high speed. The footage was slowed down in editing. Only one shot was filmed using blue-screen compositing: that of the shuttle racing past the Nostromo. The other shots were simply filmed against black backdrops, with stars added via double exposure. Though motion control photography technology was available at the time, the film's budget would not allow for it. The team therefore used a camera with wide-angle lenses mounted on a drive mechanism to make slow passes <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> the models filming at 2¬Ω frames per second, giving them the appearance of motion. Scott added smoke and wind effects to enhance the illusion. For the scene in which the Nostromo detaches from the refinery, a [...] docking arm was created using pieces from model railway kits. The Nostromo was {{pushed away from the}} refinery by a forklift covered in black velvet, causing the arm to extend out from the refinery. This created the illusion that the arm was pushing the ship forward. Shots of the ship's exterior in which characters are seen moving around inside were filmed using larger models which contained projection screens displaying pre-recorded footage.|$|E
500|$|As the German {{ground forces}} {{advanced}} across the Ukraine in August and September, the air units of JG52 kept pace ‚Äì constantly {{moving on to}} forward airbases. The Gruppe was involved in providing cover for the southern crossings over the Dneiper, the capture of Poltava, the First Battle of Kharkov and then crossing the Perekop isthmus into the Crimea. They often flew three or four missions a day when weather permitted. [...] By the end of October Graf was mastering his flying technique, becoming adept at low-level flying, and had achieved 20 victories. The rains arrived in November, turning the airfields to mud and limiting air operations {{and the number of}} serviceable aircraft. Graf‚Äôs unit was moved forward to Taganrog to support the battle for Rostov. Once the snow arrived, freezing the ground, operations picked up again. In heavy combat <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> the see-saw battle, Graf had doubled his score to 42 by the end of 1941, making him one of the Gruppe‚Äôs leading pilots. On New Year‚Äôs Day 1942, III./JG52 was transferred to the relative comfort of the large Kharkov-Rogan airfield, with its closed hangars. The blizzard conditions (often getting down to ‚àí20¬∞C overnight) made flying virtually impossible. On 24 January, Graf was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for his victories to date. Soon after, he was sent on rotation back home on leave. Within a month, his regular wingman, Steinbatz, was also awarded the Knight‚Äôs Cross for a similar score.|$|E

500|$|The {{ship was}} {{commanded}} during the trials by Captain Wilmot Nicholson, {{who had previously}} commanded the carrier [...] in 1918, and the Royal Air Force representative was Group Captain Charles Samson. Taxiing trials began on 10May with Sopwith Camel fighters and Parnall Panther reconnaissance aircraft while the ship was still docked. Flights <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> the ship to evaluate air currents over the flight deck and around the island began shortly afterward and the first on-board landing was made on 1June. Larger aircraft like the Bristol F2B fighter, the Sopwith Cuckoo torpedo bomber, and the De Havilland DH.9 bomber were also evaluated during the trials. They were generally successful with only 12 minor accidents in 143 landings in all types of weather conditions, although they did reveal that aircraft landing aboard carriers would need landing gear fitted with shock absorbers to handle the impact of landing on a pitching deck. Group Captain Samson strongly preferred {{the elimination of the}} island entirely, but Nicholson recommended that the ship be retained for service, although he was not satisfied with {{the size and shape of}} the island. He also recommended that Eagle be converted to burn fuel oil exclusively and that the removal of the 6-inch guns in exchange for anti-aircraft guns would allow the tripod mast in the island to be eliminated, since it would not then be required for fire control purposes [...]|$|E

[...] The combined troops were led by Captain Reuben F. Bernard of the 1st Cavalry. The cool overcast day became [...] "a miserable day, cold with rain and hail, when the cavalrymen attacked." [...] The Apaches were well entrenched and defending behind rocks and boulders {{near the top of}} a ridge. The soldiers had to climb a defile or a steep-sided and narrow passage of loose slick rocks to go <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> as they moved up toward the top of the mesa.

2500|$|Alderman {{kept his}} first-team place {{throughout}} the golden {{years of the}} early to mid-1930s when, despite placing tenth in the 1932 County Championship table, fresh blood in the team was to give them their first, and as yet, only County Championship capture in 1936. During these years, Alderman {{was able to keep}} his batting average ticking <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> the 25 mark, and, having played more times during the 1936 season than any other to date, cemented his place in the Derbyshire opening attack, most notably with Test cricketer Stan Worthington and sometime wicket-keeper Harry Storer alongside him. Alderman was also noted for his deep fielding. At The Oval in 1936, Surrey batsman Tom Barling swept a ball from Bill Copson to leg which looked as if it was carrying for six.
