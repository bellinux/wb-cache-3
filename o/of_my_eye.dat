500|$|You Are the Apple <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Eye</b> was {{primarily}} filmed at Ching Cheng High School (精誠中學), the school Giddens and Shen Chia-yi attended.

Asked if he was pressured by the recent success of Taiwanese films at the box office, he replied [...] "No, I am more pressured by whether the film is nice to watch, whether it will succeed in the box office, and whether it will become an embarrassment for me.

500|$|The 1995 remix {{was quite}} {{different}} from the 1984 version. It began with the sound of violins and Uilleann pipes, followed by Madonna beginning the first verse. As the song progresses, the sound of the violin fades in and the drum machine starts, and the piano is played along with it. As the chorus is sung the third time, a bass drum is also added in the flow. The violin again fades in as Madonna sings [...] "Through the windmills <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye,</b> Everyone can see the loneliness inside me." [...] Near the end, she utters the chorus a number of times, emphasizing on the word [...] "anymore" [...] and the phrase [...] "live here anymore". It ends with the Uilleann pipes fading out. The song was also treated with remixes in various formats. SoulShock & Karlin made an R styled remix; while Marcus Schulz created a house remix. Madonna's voice was paired with an energetic beat, coupled with vibrant organ lines and blipping synth effects. The remixes were released as promotional 12" [...] and CD singles on May 6, 1996.|$|E
