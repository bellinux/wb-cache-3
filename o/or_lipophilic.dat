2500|$|A popular aphorism {{used for}} {{predicting}} solubility is [...] "like dissolves like" [...] also {{expressed in the}} Latin language as [...] "Similia similibus solventur". This statement indicates that a solute will dissolve best in a solvent that has a similar chemical structure to itself. This view is simplistic, {{but it is a}} useful rule of thumb. The overall solvation capacity of a solvent depends primarily on its polarity. For example, a very polar (hydrophilic) solute such as urea is very soluble in highly polar water, less soluble in fairly polar methanol, and practically insoluble in non-polar solvents such as benzene. In contrast, a non-polar <b>or</b> <b>lipophilic</b> solute such as naphthalene is insoluble in water, fairly soluble in methanol, and highly soluble in non-polar benzene.|$|E
50|$|The hydrophilic-lipophilic {{balance of}} a {{surfactant}} {{is a measure}} of the degree to which it is hydrophilic <b>or</b> <b>lipophilic,</b> determined by calculating values for the different regions of the molecule, as described by Griffin in 1949 and 1954.

50|$|A {{bioconcentration factor}} greater than 1 is {{indicative}} of a hydrophobic <b>or</b> <b>lipophilic</b> chemical. It is an indicator of how probable a chemical is to bioaccumulate. These chemicals have high lipid affinities and will concentrate in tissues with high lipid content instead of in an aqueous environment like the cytosol. Models are used to predict chemical partitioning in the environment which in turn allows the prediction of the biological fate of lipophilic chemicals.|$|E

50|$|A part of {{ethyl alcohol}} is {{hydrophobic}}. This hydrophobic <b>or</b> <b>lipophilic</b> end can diffuse across cells {{that line the}} stomach wall. In fact, alcohol {{is one of the}} rare substances that can be absorbed in the stomach. Most food substances are absorbed in the small intestine. However, even though alcohol can be absorbed in the stomach, it is mostly absorbed in the small intestine because the small intestine has a large surface area that promotes absorption. Once alcohol is absorbed in the small intestine, it delays the release of stomach contents from emptying into the small intestine. Thus, alcohol can delay the rate of absorption of nutrients. After absorption, alcohol reaches the liver where it is metabolized.|$|E
50|$|Diffusion occurs {{through the}} walls of the vessels due to a {{concentration}} gradient, allowing the necessary exchange of ions, molecules, or blood cells. The permeability of a capillary wall is determined by the type of capillary and the surface of the endothelial cells. A continuous, tightly spaced endothelial cell lining only permits the diffusion of small molecules. Larger molecules and blood cells require adequate space between cells or holes in the lining. The high resistivity of a cellular membrane prevents the diffusion of ions without a membrane transport protein. The hydrophobicity of an endothelial cell surface determines whether water <b>or</b> <b>lipophilic</b> molecules will diffuse through the capillary lining. The blood brain barrier restricts diffusion to small hydrophobic molecules, making drug diffusion difficult to achieve.|$|E

50|$|From the {{correlation}} between lipid solubility and anaesthetic potency, both Meyer and Overton had surmised a unitary mechanism of general anaesthesia. They assumed that solubilization of lipophilic general anaesthetic in lipid bilayer of the neuron causes its malfunction and anaesthetic effect when critical concentration of anaesthetic is reached. Later in 1973 Miller and Smith suggested the critical volume hypothesis also called lipid bilayer expansion hypothesis. They assumed that bulky and hydrophobic anaesthetic molecules accumulate inside the hydrophobic (<b>or</b> <b>lipophilic)</b> regions of neuronal lipid membrane causing its distortion and expansion (thickening) due to volume displacement. Accumulation of critical amounts of anaesthetic causes membrane thickening sufficient to reversibly alter function of membrane ion channels thus providing anaesthetic effect. Actual chemical structure of the anaesthetic agent per se is not important, but its molecular volume plays the major role: the more space within membrane is occupied by anaesthetic - the greater is the anaesthetic effect. Based on this theory, in 1954 Mullins suggested that the Meyer-Overton correlation with potency can be improved if molecular volumes of anaesthetic molecules are taken into account. This theory existed for over 60 years and was supported by experimental fact that increases in atmospheric pressure reverse anaesthetic effect (pressure reversal effect).|$|E

40|$|International audienceSeeds of {{sunflower}} plants {{coated with}} the fipronil C- 14 -insecticide {{were allowed to}} grow in the greenhouse. The distribution of the C- 14 -COM pounds was studied in each part of the plant after three months. After 83 days of culture small amounts of C- 14 -compounds were found in the inflorescence (0. 6 parts per thousand of the seed deposit) which Were fipronil itself <b>or</b> its <b>lipophilic</b> <b>or</b> hydrophilic metabolites. The C- 14 -compounds were found in each part of the inflorescence (bracts, ray and disk florets containing pollen, akenes). The C- 14 -concentration in the xylem sap evaluated at this stage was much too low to explain the accumulated amount in the inflorescence. Under controlled conditions in a culture chamber, it was then demonstrated that a net phloem transfer of C- 14 -fipronil occurred from developed leaves to growing organs. This allowed us to suppose that a similar C- 14 -fipronil phloem transfer could occur toward the inflorescence during its formation. A quantitative evaluation suggests that most of the labeled. compounds at this stage were not coming from the leaves but from the roots and stem where storage compounds were hydrolyzed for sustaining inflorescence development...|$|R
