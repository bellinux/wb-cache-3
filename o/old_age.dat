5|$|Bookends is {{a concept}} album that explores a life journey from {{childhood}} to <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> Side one of the album marks successive stages in life, the theme serving as bookends to the life cycle. Side two largely consists of unused material for The Graduate soundtrack. Simon's lyrics concern youth, disillusionment, relationships, <b>old</b> <b>age,</b> and mortality. Much of the material was crafted alongside producer John Simon, who joined the recording when Simon suffered from writer's block. The album was recorded gradually over the period of a year, with production speeding up around the later months of 1967.|$|E

5|$|In March, Finance Minister Walter Harris, who was {{believed}} to be St. Laurent's heir apparent, introduced his budget.

Harris indicated that no more could be returned for fear of increasing inflation. Diefenbaker attacked the budget, calling for higher <b>old</b> <b>age</b> pensions and welfare payments, more aid to the poorer provinces, and aid to farmers.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study {{experimental}} out bred population of Drosophila nasuta used, has been originated from progenies of 50 isolated female lines collected at Chamundi hill at Mysore, India. It was found that males of D. nasuta discriminated females {{on the basis of}} their age and prefers to mate more frequently with younger of the two competing females. Although middle aged females mated faster and copulated longer compared to young and <b>old</b> <b>aged</b> females. Males showed grater courtship activities such as tapping, scissoring, vibration, liking to middle aged female compared to young or <b>old</b> <b>aged</b> females. Middle aged females showed least rejection responses such as ignoring, extruding, and decamping to courting male than young or <b>old</b> <b>aged</b> females. Young aged females laid significantly greater number of eggs and produced more progenies than middle and <b>old</b> <b>aged</b> females. Further young aged females had greater number of ovarioles than those of middle and <b>old</b> <b>aged</b> females. Thus these studies in D. nasuta suggest that female age has significant effect on male mate preference...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Suicide {{attempts}} {{have been shown to}} be less common in <b>older</b> <b>age</b> groups, with repeated attempts generally being more common in younger age groups and severe attempts in <b>older</b> <b>age</b> groups. Consistently, most studies have shown an increased suicide risk after attempts in <b>older</b> <b>age.</b> However, little is known about the predictive value of age on repeated and severe suicide attempts for accomplished suicide. The aim of the present study was to investigate the reduced incidence for initial, repeated, or severe suicide attempts with age in suicide victims and controls by gender. Methods The records of 100 suicide victims and matched controls with severe depression admitted to the Department of Psychiatry, Lund University Hospital, Sweden between 1956 and 1969, were evaluated and the subjects were monitored up to 2006. The occurrence of suicide attempts (first, repeated, or severe, by age group) was analysed for suicide victims and controls, with gender taken into consideration. Results There was a reduced risk for an initial suicide attempt by <b>older</b> <b>age</b> in females (suicide victims and controls) and male controls (but not suicide victims). The risk for repeated suicide attempts appeared to be reduced in the <b>older</b> <b>age</b> groups in female controls as compared to female suicide victims. The risk for severe suicide attempts seemed reduced in the <b>older</b> <b>age</b> groups in female suicide victims. This risk was also reduced in male controls and in male controls compared to male suicide victims. Conclusion In the <b>older</b> <b>age</b> groups repeated attempts appeared to be predictive for suicide in women and severe attempts predictive in men. </p...|$|R

RESULTS: In univariate analysis, <b>older</b> <b>age,</b> Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score, a greater value of Peritoneal Cancer Index (PCI) and sub-optimal cytoreduction were correlated with higher mortality, while <b>older</b> <b>age,</b> presence of ascites, ovarian origin of carcinomatosis, closed technique, a greater value of PCI, longer operative time and sub-optimal cytoreduction were predictors of higher morbidity.
