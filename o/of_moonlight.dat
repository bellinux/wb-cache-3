5|$|The first mythological film {{produced}} by their studio, Mayabazar marked a milestone for Nagi Reddy and Chakrapani. In {{addition to the}} technical crew, 400 studio workers– including light men, carpenters, and painters– participated {{in the development of}} the film. Director Reddy was meticulous with the pre-production and casting phases, which took nearly a year to complete. Though Rama Rao was initially reluctant to play the lead role, his portrayal of Krishna received acclaim and yielded more offers to reprise the same role in several unrelated films. The soundtrack features twelve songs, with most of the musical score composed by Ghantasala. Telugu lyrics were written by Pingali Nagendrarao and Tamil lyrics were written by Thanjai N. Ramaiah Dass. Four of the songs were composed by S. Rajeswara Rao prior to his unexplained departure from the project. One of them was accompanied by the first illusion <b>of</b> <b>moonlight</b> in Indian cinema, shot by cinematographer Marcus Bartley.|$|E
5|$|The {{conventions}} <b>of</b> <b>Moonlight</b> are based, in part, on {{a unique}} mythology. Some {{parts of the}} mythology that are common include a sire, that is the vampire who turns a human into a vampire; though in the show the sire must teach him or her how to live as one. A vampire's bite {{is not enough to}} turn a human into a vampire; the human, when near death, must drink the sire's blood or have vampire blood in his or her system at the moment of death. The process of vampirization also affects their genetics, causing their DNA to be fundamentally altered to suit their bodies' new state. This makes genetic testing between vampires and their human relatives impossible unless the vampire has a sample of their own human DNA from before they were turned, such as a lock of hair. They must consume human blood to survive. They also develop psychic powers and can glimpse the future and the past. This ability, along with their night vision, is an extension of their heightened senses. Daylight does not kill vampires, but does make them progressively weaker. Silver and fire are toxic, whereas garlic, holy water and crucifixes are useless. A vampire's image cannot be captured with analogue cameras containing silver emulsion in the film; digital cameras are able to capture an image because they do not use silver emulsion. Though undead, vampires have a pulse, are not cold blooded (but still don't produce body heat as seen in episode 11 so as heat signature cameras won't see them), and cannot turn into a bat. The best ways to kill them are by decapitation or burning; a stake through the heart is painful but only causes paralysis. Moonlight vampires have many of the preternatural abilities as described in vampire mythology; they have superhuman strength and speed, they heal rapidly from any wound, they can defy gravity to a limited degree to perform parkour feats, their bite has hypnotic effects on weak-minded humans, and they are immortal. Their powers increase as they get older. Their blood has drug-like affects when consumed by humans; causing euphoria and temporarily heightened senses.|$|E

25|$|As {{the narrator}} reads of the knight's forcible {{entry into the}} dwelling, {{cracking}} and ripping sounds are heard somewhere in the house. When the dragon is described as shrieking as it dies, a shriek is heard, again within the house. As he relates the shield falling from off the wall, a reverberation, metallic and hollow, can be heard. Roderick becomes increasingly hysterical, and eventually exclaims that these sounds are being made by his sister, who was in fact alive when she was entombed. Additionally, Roderick somehow {{knew that she was}} alive. The bedroom door is then blown open to reveal Madeline standing there. She falls on her brother, and both land on the floor as corpses. The narrator then flees the house, and, as he does so, notices a flash <b>of</b> <b>moonlight</b> behind him which causes him to turn back, {{in time to see the}} moon shining through the suddenly widened crack.

40|$|Moonlighting {{proteins}} are multifunctional {{proteins that}} participate in unrelated biological processes {{and that are}} {{not the result of}} gene fusion. A certain number of these proteins have been characterized in yeasts, and the easy genetic manipulation of these microorganisms has been useful for a thorough analysis of some cases <b>of</b> <b>moonlighting.</b> As the awareness <b>of</b> the <b>moonlighting</b> phenomenon has increased, a growing number of these proteins are being uncovered. In this review, we present a crop <b>of</b> newly identified <b>moonlighting</b> proteins from yeasts and discuss the experimental evidence that qualifies them to be classified as such. The variety <b>of</b> <b>moonlighting</b> functions encompassed by the proteins considered extends from control of transcription to DNA repair or binding to plasminogen.

50|$|Protein {{moonlighting}} (or gene sharing) is {{a phenomenon}} by which a protein can perform more than one function. Ancestral moonlighting proteins originally possessed a single function but through evolution, acquired additional functions. Many proteins that moonlight are enzymes; others are receptors, ion channels or chaperones. The most common primary function <b>of</b> <b>moonlighting</b> proteins is enzymatic catalysis, but these enzymes have acquired secondary non-enzymatic roles. Some examples <b>of</b> functions <b>of</b> <b>moonlighting</b> proteins secondary to catalysis include signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, motility, and structural.|$|R

The cyclicality <b>of</b> female <b>moonlighting</b> has, nonetheless, varied {{over the course of the}} past 35 years. Female moonlighting seemed to behave counter-cyclically during much of the 1980 s and early 1990 s, confirming the popular media belief that moonlighting is more likely to occur during periods of economic distress. Yet, this counter-cyclical behavior disappears during the 1993 - 99 period to become pro-cyclical by the early twentieth century. The recent pro-cyclicality <b>of</b> female <b>moonlighting</b> supports the idea that female workers respond to a need for “just-in-time” employment following the economic upturn of the mid to late 1990 s. ...|$|R

At any rate, the systematic variation <b>of</b> <b>moonlighting</b> over the business cycle may have implications for the procyclical nature of real wages...|$|R
500|$|During rehearsals, Venkata Reddy timed his actors with a stopwatch, {{calculating the}} length of each scene (including songs) to {{determine}} the film's length. D.S.

Its outdoor filming lasted for 10to 15 seconds. Bartley then created an illusion <b>of</b> <b>moonlight,</b> which according to Ambu Rao was a first for an Indian film. Nageswara Rao was injured on the film's set, and action sequences featuring himself and Ranga Rao were shot only after his recovery, causing a three-month delay in {{the release of the}} film.

500|$|Later, the {{physical}} {{form of the}} Moon and the cause <b>of</b> <b>moonlight</b> became understood. The ancient Greek philosopher Anaxagoras [...] reasoned that the Sun and Moon were both giant spherical rocks, and that the latter reflected {{the light of the}} former. Although the Chinese of the Han Dynasty believed the Moon to be energy equated to qi, their 'radiating influence' theory also recognized that the light of the Moon was merely a reflection of the Sun, and Jing Fang (78–37BC) noted the sphericity of the Moon. In the 2nd century AD Lucian wrote a novel where the heroes travel to the Moon, which is inhabited. In 499AD, the Indian astronomer Aryabhata mentioned in his Aryabhatiya that reflected sunlight is the cause of the shining of the Moon. The astronomer and physicist Alhazen (965–1039) found that sunlight was not reflected from the Moon like a mirror, but that light was emitted from every part of the Moon's sunlit surface in all directions. Shen Kuo (1031–1095) of the Song dynasty created an allegory equating the waxing and waning of the Moon to a round ball of reflective silver that, when doused with white powder and viewed from the side, would appear to be a crescent.|$|E

In this review, we highlight some notable and recent examples <b>of</b> <b>moonlighting</b> enzymes and their possible contributions to human disease.

40|$|Informal firms play {{a crucial}} role in both {{developing}} and developed countries, and there is evidence of a larger presence <b>of</b> <b>moonlighting</b> firms over ghost firms. The former are firms that operate simultaneously in the official and unofficial sectors, whereas the ghost firms undertake their production only underground. In order to deal with this evidence, through an ad-hoc assumption we represent a specific technological advantage <b>of</b> <b>moonlighting</b> firms over ghost firms, modelled through an aggregate-capital externality. In this setting we examine the steady state effect of fiscal policies aimed to support firms, in particular investment subsidies and tax allowances, on firm size and underground production. Among the main results, a tax cut (rise), induces the moonlighting firm to engage in more (less) official production. Contrary to the presumption that subsidies may also be useful for pushing firms to operate over ground, in the presence <b>of</b> <b>moonlighting</b> technology, the incentives to improve capital stock turn out to be counterproductive in that they increase the unofficial economy overall. formal and informal sectors, capital investment, tax exemptions...|$|R

The purpose of this exploratory study was to describe the incidence and experience <b>of</b> <b>moonlighting</b> among public school teachers in Illinois. Secondarily, the study attempted to describe several sub-groups of moonlighters, including summer moonlighters, school year moonlighters, internal moonlighters and external moonlighters. There was also an attempt to solicit the insight of teachers in regard to the impact the current funding crisis in Illinois may have had upon the availability <b>of</b> <b>moonlighting</b> opportunities within the school and to assess the status of employment contracts that required participation in school-related extracurricular activities. This was the first attempt in Illinois to study the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>moonlighting.</b> The study was based partially upon other studies in Texas and Delaware, which also sought to explore and describe the incidence <b>of</b> <b>moonlighting</b> in those states. Data were collected from a stratified random sample of 593 unit district public school teachers in Illinois. Stratification of the sample was on the basis of district wealth, as measured by the per pupil expense level of the district. The sample was tested and compared for geographic and demographic representation and did not differ significantly from the population. The findings of this study indicated that the total percentage <b>of</b> <b>moonlighting</b> teachers was 28. 8 %, while sunlighters represented 44. 0 %. Of the teachers who were moonlighters, 74. 9 % were also sunlighters. Three sub-categories of moonlighters that were not mutually exclusive were internal non-athletic moonlighters at 25. 1 %, internal athletic moonlighters at 14. 5 %, and external moonlighters at 23. 6 %. Moonlighting income averaged $ 3, 418 per year and the number of hours per week that were spent on moonlighting activities averaged 13. 9. The study concluded that moonlighting activities occupy the time, commitment and energy of many teachers and that the majority of teachers who embraced moonlighting activities felt that those activities were in competition with the quality of their own teaching. In addition, the majority of moonlighters and sunlighters would have ceased to embark upon these activities if their teaching salaries had been somewhat higher. These conclusions demonstrated the need for instructional leaders {{to be aware of the}} incidence and impact <b>of</b> <b>moonlighting</b> activities upon reform efforts in the schools...|$|R
