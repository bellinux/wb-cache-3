Gia Long enacted monetary reform and implemented a more socialized agrarian policy. However, the population growth far outstripped that of land clearing and cultivation. There was little emphasis on innovation in agricultural technology, so the improvements in productivity were mainly derived from increasing the amount of cultivated farmland.|$|E

40|$|Rates <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> in {{the hotel}} and {{catering}} industry are a contentious issue. The industry is traditionally labour intensive and labour costs form a significant proportion of the total running costs of an organisation. On the other hand, the industry has a reputation for low pay, and evidence suggests that pay in the industry consistently falls behind many other industries. Information about pay in the industry is however limited. Existing sources do not provide detailed data on the rates <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> for a range of employees {{in the hotel}} and catering industry. The aim of this research therefore, is to develop a comprehensive study <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> in the industry for particular grades of staff, and also to examine the factors that influence pay in the industry. A survey was conducted throughout Great Britain into rates <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> in the hotel sector, the restaurant sector, the industrial catering sector and the contract catering sector. Rates were found to be generally higher in the industrial catering sector, while the hotel and restaurant sectors tended to have very similar rates <b>of</b> <b>pay.</b> The traditionally female occupations in the industry, such as the room maid and the housekeeper are shown to have some of the lowest rates <b>of</b> <b>pay,</b> and some average rates <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> were below the legal minimum laid down by the Wages Council, The examination <b>of</b> determinants <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> in the industry demonstrates that pay for the unskilled grades of staff is influenced by factors such as the regional and locational situation of the hotel restaurant or unit. As there are variations of demand for labour and alternative job opportunities in different regions and locations around Great Britain, the average rate <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> for unskilled workers fluctuates. The <b>pay</b> <b>of</b> the skilled grades of staff was affected to a greater extent by factors such as the size or the price level of a unit. These factors are mainly indicative of the style of the operation and perhaps the level of skill demanded...|$|R

5|$|The Rock Springs massacre, {{also known}} as the Rock Springs Riot, {{occurred}} on September 2, 1885, in the present-day United States city of Rock Springs in Sweetwater County, Wyoming. The riot, between Chinese immigrant miners and white immigrant miners, was the result of racial tensions and an ongoing labor dispute over the Union Pacific Coal Department's policy <b>of</b> <b>paying</b> Chinese miners lower wages than white miners. This policy caused the Chinese to be hired over the white miners, which further angered the white miners and contributed to the riot. When the rioting ended, at least 28 Chinese miners were dead and 15 were injured. Rioters burned 78 Chinese homes resulting in approximately US$150,000 in property damage ($ in present-day terms).|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} short and {{long-term}} effects <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> dispersion on firm performance in publicly listed Swedish firms. Pay dispersion refers to the difference in compensation between or within organizational levels. There are two contradicting theoretical views <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> dispersions effect on firm performance. While tournament theory suggests that high pay dispersion increase employees’ incentives to exert higher effort, thus increasing firm performance, fairness approaches predicts that high pay dispersion creates feelings of unfairness, thus negatively affecting firm performance. Based on these theories and previous research, Hypothesis 1 predicts a positive short-term effect <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> dispersion on firm performance, and Hypothesis 2 predicts a negative long-term effect <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> dispersion on firm performance. Using a first differences fixed-effects regression including controls for firm characteristics and corporate governance indicators, three measures <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> dispersion are tested on two proxies for firm performance (price to book and return on assets). We conclude after extensive robustness tests that pay dispersion {{has no effect on}} firm performance, neither on short nor on long-term. Therefore, both hypotheses are rejected...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{evaluate}} employee perceptions <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> practice in civil service executive agencies in the wake of changes in the established institutions <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> determination. Design/methodology/approach – A survey design drawing original data from 1, 057 civil servants, all members of the IPMS (now merged with EMA to form Prospectus), the union representing scientific, technical and professional occupations in the civil service. Findings – The study distinguishes four distinctive pay practice systems. Pay satisfaction is found to be positively related to two principles: a clear effort-reward link and an understanding <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> criteria. However, employees are more satisfied with pay when their organisational pay system accords with traditional rather than newer practices. This suggests that embedded norms continue to exert a powerful influence over employee perceptions <b>of</b> <b>pay.</b> Research limitations/implications – Whilst the respondent profile accurately reflects those working in the scientific, professional and technical grades (predominantly male, white, full-time workers), aspects of this profile do not accurately reflect the civil service as a whole. Practical implications – Old habits “die hard”. A sobering message for those practitioners who readily assume that forced change in pay systems will elicit “desired” employee responses. Originality/value – Against a backdrop of fundamental changes in the character <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> determination in the civil service, this study presents employee perceptions <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> practices, shows how they combine in ways that reflect a distinct set <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> systems and reveals the impact associated with these systems on attitudes and behaviours...|$|R
