40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} the rock mass geotechnical behaviour of primary copper ore at the El Teniente mine in Chile, {{which has been}} described as a massive and competent rock mass. The rock mass was characterised considering different structural data collection techniques and mapping scales. Modifications were made to the traditional sampling methodologies to better determine the observed geological discontinuities within primary copper ore. It was found that few open geological discontinuities, mainly the widely spaced large scale sub-vertical faults, are observed within primary ore, and this could be in agreement with the observed “competent” and “massive” rock mass behaviour at the mine site. The study also found a high frequency of small scale stockwork veins (cemented joints), which define at least three semi-orthogonal set orientations mine wide. The faces of caved rock blocks found in the production level draw points were also characterised and an empirical criterion to define weak discontinuities that define caved blocks was established. From these observations, it can be concluded that the geological discontinuities (veins) having less than 1 / 3 of hard minerals as infill (hard mineral means Mohs scale of hardness ≥ 4) and thickness greater than or equal to 2 mm may also be the weaker path where a competent rock mass fail under caveinduced stress conditions. This empirical definition was applied for the structural data collected from different geological units and mine sectors of the El Teniente mine. The results allowed a differentiation of several geotechnical units where traditional rock mass classifications schemes failed. The observed rock mass behaviour during caving operations was back analysed to correlate with the new geotechnical units defined using that empirical definition. The back analysis studies included the rock damage as mine <b>overbrake</b> in mine drive at the undercut level, fragmentation performance, and mine seismicity recorded within a rock volume completely caved. A mine scale finite element numerical model was also built to assess the stress state around excavations during caving propagation. Damage orientation determination by seismic focal solutions was used to correlate against collected structural data to investigate the influence of weak discontinuities during block caving performance...|$|E
5000|$|A {{steam brake}} acts {{directly}} and immediately; the sudden {{opening of the}} brake valve {{can result in a}} slight <b>overbraking</b> by locking the wheels. The operation of a steam brake therefore requires a great deal of experience from the engine driver.|$|R

2500|$|Brakes used a two-circuit {{hydraulic}} system (two fluid distributors and two master cylinders, {{one for the}} front {{and one for the}} rear), Lockheed-type duplex brakes [...] drums all round. An equaliser was fitted, which could avoid <b>overbraking</b> by changing the distribution of braking force between the front and rear brakes during driving.|$|R
50|$|Improper {{engine braking}} {{technique}} {{can cause the}} wheels to skid (also called shift-locking), especially on slippery surfaces such as ice or snow, {{as a result of}} too much deceleration. As in a skid caused by <b>overbraking,</b> the vehicle will not regain traction until the wheels are allowed to turn more quickly. If the driver reduces engine braking by shifting back up, or disengaging the clutch on a manual transmission, traction can be regained.|$|R

5000|$|As per the {{technical}} paper published by Buschmann et al."The {{job of the}} EBD as a subsystem of the ABS system is to control the effective adhesion utilization by the rear wheels. The pressure of the rear wheels are approximated to the ideal brake force distribution in a partial braking operation. To do so, the conventional brake design is modified {{in the direction of}} rear axle <b>overbraking,</b> and the components of the ABS are used. EBD reduces the strain on the hydraulic brake force proportioning valve in the vehicle. EBD optimizes the brake design with regard to: adhesion utilization; driving stability; wear; temperature stress; and pedal force." ...|$|R
40|$|We study {{condensation}} in one-dimensional transport {{models with}} a kinetic constraint. The kinetic constraint results in clustering of immobile vehicles; these clusters can grow to macroscopic condensates, indicating {{the onset of}} dynamic phase separation between free flowing and arrested traffic. We investigate analytically {{the conditions under which}} this occurs, and derive a necessary and sufficient criterion for phase separation. This criterion is applied to the well-known Nagel-Schreckenberg model of traffic flow to analytically investigate the existence of dynamic condensates. We find that true condensates occur only when acceleration out of jammed traffic happens in a single time step, in the limit of strong <b>overbraking.</b> Our predictions are further verified with simulation results on the growth of arrested clusters. These results provide analytic understanding of dynamic arrest and dynamic phase separation in one-dimensional traffic and transport models...|$|R
