50|$|When an {{internal}} combustion engine is under high load (e.g. wide open throttle), the <b>output</b> of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>sensor</b> is ignored, and the ECU automatically enriches the mixture to protect the engine, as misfires under load {{are much more likely}} to cause damage. This is referred to as an engine running in 'open-loop mode'. Any changes in the <b>sensor</b> <b>output</b> will be ignored in this state. In many cars (with the exception of some turbocharged models), inputs from the air flow meter are also ignored, as they might otherwise lower engine performance due to the mixture being too rich or too lean, and increase the risk of engine damage due to detonation if the mixture is too lean.|$|R

The purpose of this research is to clarify the influence of the temperature, humidity and the atmospheric pressure to the gas <b>sensor</b> <b>output.</b> However, the fluctuation of the base level of the <b>sensor</b> <b>output</b> every day is considerably large. So, it is difficult to introduce directly some information from the sensor level. It is attempted to characterize the variance by smoothing the <b>sensor</b> <b>output</b> using the moving average method. As for results, a strong correlation coefficient presents between the <b>sensor</b> <b>output</b> and the atmospheric pressure. This result can be applied to predict a <b>sensor</b> <b>output.</b> The <b>sensor</b> <b>output</b> is derived roughly using an approximate equation, which is introduced by the trigonometric function.
