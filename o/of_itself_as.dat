POW, which had involved interviews with members of organisations among disadvantaged communities in the PWV area, international academics, students and staff at Wits, and even {{a meeting with the}} then-banned ANC in Lusaka, revealed that to many in the surrounding disadvantaged communities, there was a perception of Wits as an elitist institution dominated by white interests. A need was identified for further transformation of the university.|$|E

However, Goodrick-Clarke noted that the group's [...] "ideas and rituals" [...] draw upon [...] "a native tradition", with references to the pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon concept of wyrd, an emphasis on ceremonies performed at equinoxes, {{and the construction of}} incense using indigenous trees, thus suggesting the idea of [...] "rootedness in English nature".

500|$|Hugh Urban of Ohio State University notes {{a number}} of {{connections}} between Scientology and Battlefield Earth in his 2011 book The Church of Scientology: A History of a New Religion. Not only was the film released only {{three days after the}} 50th anniversary of the publication of Hubbard's book Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health, but the villainous Psychlos have been interpreted by many observers as an obvious allusion to Scientology's , psychiatry. The conflict between the Psychlos and the free humans {{can be seen as a}} reflection of Scientology's own conception <b>of</b> <b>itself</b> <b>as</b> fighting on behalf of humanity against the forces of psychiatry. The [...] "space opera" [...] genre of the book and film manifests itself in numerous places in Scientology itself, most famously in OT III (the Xenu story). Travolta's own commitment to such a disastrous project as the film version of Battlefield Earth is, in Urban's estimation, indicative of his [...] "unusual dedication" [...] to Scientology.|$|E

500|$|Conscience also {{features}} prominently in Buddhism. In the Pali scriptures, for example, Buddha links the positive aspect of conscience to a pure {{heart and a}} calm, well-directed mind. It {{is regarded as a}} spiritual power, and one of the “Guardians of the World”. The Buddha also associated conscience with compassion for those who must endure cravings and suffering in the world until right conduct culminates in right mindfulness and right contemplation. Santideva (685–763 CE) wrote in the Bodhicaryavatara (which he composed and delivered in the great northern Indian Buddhist university of Nalanda) of the spiritual importance of perfecting virtues such as generosity, forbearance and training the awareness to be like a [...] "block of wood" [...] when attracted by vices such as pride or lust; so one can continue advancing towards right understanding in meditative absorption. Conscience thus manifests in Buddhism as unselfish love for all living beings which gradually intensifies and awakens to a purer awareness where the mind withdraws from sensory interests and becomes aware <b>of</b> <b>itself</b> <b>as</b> a single whole.|$|E
500|$|German philosopher Immanuel Kant (17241804) divided {{arguments}} {{for the existence}} of God into three groups: ontological, cosmological, or teleological. Scholars disagree on whether Avicenna's Proof of the Truthful is ontological, that is, derived through sheer conceptual analysis, or cosmological, that is, derived by invoking empirical premises (e.g. [...] "a contingent thing exists"). Scholars Herbert A. Davidson, Lenn E. Goodman, Michael E. Marmura, M. Saeed Sheikh, and Soheil Afnan argued that it was cosmological. Davidson said that Avicenna did not regard [...] "the analysis of the concept necessary existent by virtue <b>of</b> <b>itself</b> <b>as</b> sufficient to establish the actual existence of anything in the external world" [...] and that he had offered a new form of cosmological argument. Others, including Parviz Morewedge, Gary Legenhausen, Abdel Rahman Badawi, Miguel Cruz Hernández, and M. M. Sharif, argued that Avicenna's argument was ontological. Morewedge referred to the argument as [...] "Ibn Sina's ontological argument {{for the existence of}} God", and said that it was purely based on his analytic specification of this concept [...]" [...] Steve A. Johnson and Toby Mayer said the argument was a hybrid of the two.|$|E
500|$|In 1981, Christgau {{stated that}} {{although}} few critics agreed with Goldstein {{at the time}} of his negative contemporary review, many later came to appreciate his sentiments. In the opinion of Lester Bangs – the so-called [...] "godfather" [...] of punk rock journalism, also writing in 1981 – [...] "Goldstein was right in his much-vilified review... predicting that this record had the power to almost singlehandedly destroy rock and roll." [...] He notes: [...] "In the sixties rock and roll began to think <b>of</b> <b>itself</b> <b>as</b> an 'art form'. Rock and roll is not an 'art form'; rock and roll is a raw wail from the bottom of the guts." [...] The musicologist John Kimsey cites the preservation of authenticity as a guiding tenet of rock music and suggests that many purists denounce Sgt. Pepper in that respect, accusing the album of [...] "mark a fall from primal grace into pretense, production and self-consciousness." [...] In his opinion, detractors regard the LP as less a breakthrough and more a [...] "break with all that's good, true and rocking". According to Christgau: [...] "Although Sgt. Pepper is thought of as the most influential of all rock masterpieces, it is really only the most famous. In retrospect it seems peculiarly apollonian – precise, controlled, even stiff – and it is clearly peripheral to the rock mainstream". In Moore's estimation, [...] "because its cultural impact was so large, it was simply being asked to do too much." ...|$|E

500|$|The ONA {{does not}} {{initiate}} members into the group itself, but rather expects {{an individual to}} initiate themselves. It requires that initiates be in a good physical condition, and recommends a training regimen for prospective members to follow. [...] Newcomers are expected {{to take on a}} magical partner of the opposite sex, or of the same sex if they are lesbian or gay. Thenceforth, the practitioner must undertake personal and increasingly difficult challenges in order to move through the different grades. Most of the ordeals that allow the initiate to proceed to the next stage are publicly revealed by the Order in its introductory material, as it is believed that the true initiatory element lies in the experience itself and can only be attained through performing them. For instance, part of the ritual to become an External Adept involves an ordeal in which the prospective member is to find a lonely spot and to lay there, still, for an entire night without moving or sleeping. The initiatory process for the role of Internal Adept entails the practitioner withdrawing from human society for three months, from an equinox to a solstice, or (more usually) for six months, [...] during which time they must live in the wild without modern conveniences or contact with civilisation. [...] The next stage – the Ritual of the Abyss – involves the candidate living alone in a dark isolated cavern for a lunar month. According to Jeffrey Kaplan, an academic specialist of the far right, these physically and mentally challenging initiatory tasks reflect [...] "the ONA's conception <b>of</b> <b>itself</b> <b>as</b> a vanguard organization composed of a tiny coterie of Nietzschean elites." ...|$|E
