40|$|In KSTAR device, a 110 GHz ECH {{system has}} been a useful heating device for a stable plasma {{start-up}} because a pure <b>ohmic</b> <b>discharge</b> scenario with a limited loop voltage of about 4 V was sometimes not successful for burn-through and plasma current ramp-up due to inconsistent wall conditioning and density control. Even though a pure <b>ohmic</b> <b>discharge</b> also was successful, the application of X 2 -mode ECH could reduce the flux consumption of poloidal field coils, leading to long pulse discharges. The ECH power was injected {{at the time of}} the field null formation after the onset of the toroidal electric field in which the electron temperature significantly increased up to 100 eV so that burn-through is overcome. The ECH heating enabled the formation of close flux surfaces earlier, leading to the reliable plasma current ramp-up, but, it caused outward plasma movement and failure of the plasma control, resulting in loss of the discharge. Moreover, impurities from the plasma facing components caused by not fully absorbed ECH power had a detrimental effect on the H-mode transition. In ECH-assisted start-up in the ramp-up phase, ECH power was mainly used for central electron heating, leading to reduction of the flux consumption of the central coils by increasing the electron temperature along with a density increase in the ramp-up phase. When X 2 -mode ECH power of 350 kW was injected at the mid-plane with a toroidal angle of 10 degree for 1 sec after the onset of the loop voltage, the flux consumption was reduced by about 30 % in comparison with the pure ohmic discharges...|$|E
40|$|Diamagnetic {{measurements}} of poloidal beta {{have been performed}} in the STOR-M tokamak by a flux loop placed exterior to the vacuum chamber. Poloidal beta {{is defined as the}} ratio of plasma kinetic pressure to poloidal magentic field pressure. Compensation for the vacuum toroidal field has been performed using a non-enclosing co-planar coil, and vibrational compensation from auxiliary coils. It was found that in STOR-M conditions (20 % toroidal magnetic field decay over discharge) there is significant influence on the diamagnetic flux measurements from strong residual signals, presumably from image currents being induced by the toroidal field coils, requiring further compensation. A blank (non-plasma) shot is used specifically to eliminate the residual component which is not proportional to the toroidal magnetic field. Data from normal <b>ohmic</b> <b>discharge</b> operation is presented and calculations of poloidal beta from coil data (βθ ≃ 0. 5) is found to be in reasonable agreement with the values of poloidal beta obtained from {{measurements of}} electron density and Spitzer temperature with neoclassical corrections for trapped electrons. Contributions present in the blank shot (residual) signal and the limitations of this method are discussed. A pulse with Compact Toroid Injection was examined and compared to a normal <b>ohmic</b> <b>discharge,</b> and one where the Compact Toroid Injector was used to supply the tokamak with neutral gas. Soft X-Ray (SXR) measurements were taken and compared. There is a strong agreement between the profiles of the poloidal beta and the SXR measurements. The bulk plasma thermal energy was measured and found to increase by 5. 6 J following the injection of a CT. The diamagnetic measurements appear to be affected by image currents induced in the chamber walls by the plasma current, and also by plasma position fluctuations.

Only a very weak dependence of chi(e) on Z(eff) is observed, both in ohmic and in ECH discharges. The scaling of chi(e) with n(e) and Z(eff) is consistent with the scaling of the global tau(Ee), both showing an absence of scaling with Z(eff).

O 2 /He-ICWC applied to erode carbon co- deposits removed 6. 6 × 1021 C-atoms (39 pulses, 158 s cumulated discharge time). Large oxygen retention (71 % of injected oxygen) prevented subsequent <b>ohmic</b> <b>discharge</b> initiation. Plasma operation was recovered by a 1 h 47 multi- pulse D 2 -ICWC procedure including pumping time between pulses with duty cycle of 2 s/ 20 s, cleaning the vessel from oxygen impurities, followed by a 23 min He-ICWC procedure (2 s/ 20 s), applied to desaturate the deuterium- loaded walls. A stable <b>ohmic</b> <b>discharge</b> was established on the first attempt right after the recovery procedure. The discharges showed improved density control and only slightly increased oxygen characteristic radiation levels (1 – 1. 5 times). After the recovery procedure 36 % of the injected O-atoms remained retained in the vessel, derived from mass spectrometry measurements. This amount is in the estimated range for storage in remote areas obtained from surface analysis of locally exposed samples. The removed amount of oxygen by D 2 and He-ICWC obtained from mass spectrometry corresponds to the retention in plasma-wetted areas estimated by surface analysis. It is concluded {{that most of the}} removed oxygen stems from plasma-wetted areas while shadowed areas, e. g. behind poloidal limiters, may feature net retention of the discharge gas. On ITER, designed with a shaped first wall, the ICWC plasma-wetted area will approach the total surface area, reducing consequently the retention in remote areas. A tentative extrapolation of the carbon removal on TEXTOR to tritium removal from co-deposits on ITER in the 39 × 4 s O 2 /He-ICWC discharges, including pumping time between the RF pulses, corresponds on ITER to a tritium removal in the order of the estimated retention per 400 s DT-burn (140 – 500 mgT (Shimada and Pitts 2011 J.

40|$|We propose that, in regimes {{where the}} applied {{electric}} field drives the plasma current {{and at the}} same times heats the plasmas, the transport of electron thermal energy and the redistributino of the electron current density are strongly coupled. Thus we introduce a matrix equation that described the transport of both quantities.

40|$|The radial {{profiles}} of electrostatic Reynolds stress and fluctuation-driven particle flux have been {{measured in the}} plasma boundary using a multi-array of fast reciprocating Langmuir probes during the static 6 / 2 and 3 / 1 mode dynamic ergodic divertor (DED) operation on TEXTOR. In the <b>ohmic</b> <b>discharge</b> phase before DED, a large radial gradient of Reynolds stress is observed around the flow shear region, suggesting the importance of turbulence-driven flows in the plasma edge. With DED, it is shown that the magnetic ergodization may suppress the Reynolds stress at the plasma boundary and thus rearrange the profile of poloidal momentum. Before DED, the local turbulent flux displays {{a reduction in the}} sheared flow layer. During the static DED phase, it is generally seen that the flux reverses direction from radially outwards to inwards in the ergodic zone. At the high DED current operation in the 3 / 1 configuration, a strong modification on the radial profile of the turbulent flux is observed. The results may have significant implications for the understanding of the electrostatic turbulence, fluctuation-induced flows and associated transport with magnetic stochastization.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we report the {{observation}} of a natural generated internal particle transport barrier (pITB) in purely Ohmically heated plasmas in the HL- 2 A tokamak. The pITB have been observed when the line average electron density exceeds a threshold, which is nc= 2. 2 × 1019 m- 3. The phenomenon is perfectly reproducible and identified by profile analysis, perturbative transport studies with Supersonic Molecular Beam Injection (SMBI) modulation and the Doppler reflectometry. The influence of the ECRH heating on pITB will be also presented in this paper. The barrier is generally located around ρ = 0. 65 - 0. 7 with a width of 1 - 2 cm. Especial analysing the propagation of a particle wave generated by SMBI modulation across the barrier, the particle diffusivity and the convective velocity have been separately determined. The diffusivity is rather will-like than step-like and lower in the zone of barrier than outside. The convection is inward outside of the barrier, while the convection is outward inside the barrier. The experimental results have been compared to an analytical model for particle transport to quantitatively characterize this barrier. A satisfactory agreement has been found between the experimental points and the analytical calculation. The change of sign for the convective velocity has been explained by the turbulence TEM/ITG system. The density threshold in pure <b>Ohmic</b> <b>discharge</b> may be correlated to the TEM/ITG transition via the collisionality.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{several limitations}} {{in the current}} state of the art fractional models, and applies fractional transport concepts to transport in confined plasmas. One limitation that is addressed is the discrepancy between the strict mathematical properties of the Levy distributions that underlie fractional diffusion models and the distributions observed in experiment and numerical simulation. Specifically, the second and higher moments of the Levy distribution are infinite, while the moments of observed distributions are finite. This issue is dealt with using tempered, or truncated Levy statistics in which the moments of the Levy distributions are regularized by including exponential damping, with damping constant λ, into the tails of the distribution. In this thesis these tempered Levy processes are studied in the context of a spatially tempered fractional Fokker-Planck (TFFP) equation and in the context of fluctuation driven transport. Other limitations that this thesis addresses are related to the dimensionality of the fractional derivatives commonly used to model transport, and the application of fractional derivatives to transport in bounded finite-sized domains. Many fractional models of radial transport in a cylindrical system are based on one-dimensional Cartesian fractional operators. In this thesis a fully two-dimensional fractional Laplacian operator is developed from a generalized random walk model. This 2 D operator can be azimuthally averaged to produce a radial fractional operator that correctly incorporates, near the origin, all the geometric effects of a 2 D circular system. There are also subtleties in applying fractional derivative operators, which are often formulated on an unbounded domain, to a finite domain. In this this thesis a bounded domain model of radial fractional transport is formed using mask functions that modify the kernels of the fractional operators and that go to zero in a boundary layer to remove mathematical singularities associated with limiting the range of integration. This thesis also presents an analytic solution to the one-dimensional fractional thermal wave equation for the unbounded domain. To the author's knowledge, no such thermal wave solution is present in the literature. Finally this thesis also compares the results from the radial fractional model to experimental results taken from several different tokamak fusion devices. The devices considered include the General Atomic's machine DIII-D and the major European devices: the Joint European Torus (JET), the Axially Symmetric Divertor Experiment (ASDEX-Upgrade), and the Rijnhuizen Tokamak Project (RTP). The survey focuses on two types of experiment: steady off-axis ECH experiments from RTP and power modulation experiments from JET, ASDEX-Upgrade, and DIII-D. In the steady heating experiments from RTP, hollow temperature profiles, or profiles that peak away from the center, are observed. Hollow profiles are an intrinsic feature of the radial fractional model, and it is found that the radial model is robust in describing the observed RTP profiles. In the power modulation experiments, the fractional model only achieves good agreement with the measurements for the high-frequency modulation in the purely <b>Ohmic</b> <b>discharge</b> # 10589 in ASDEX-Upgrade for α = 1. 75.

It has been suggested that a strongly sheared poloidal flow can reduce particle and energy losses by the stabilization of unstable modes and decorrelation of turbulence the edge region of the plasma. A Gundestrup probe, a Mach probe array, is used to measure both the parallel and perpendicular flow velocities in the Saskatchewan Torus-Modified (STOR-M) tokamak during several discharge conditions. It is observed that during <b>Ohmic</b> <b>discharges</b> there is no velocity shear and the direction of the parallel flow is independent of the direction of the toroidal magnetic field. During H-mode induced by a turbulent heating current pulse, a region of strong velocity shear develops in the plasma edge and an edge transport barrier develops.

During electrode biasing experiments, a stainless steel biasing electrode is inserted into the plasma up to r = 82 mm and biased to + 500 V relative to the vacuum chamber. It is observed that the particle confinement improves during the biasing phase while the energy confinement is degraded.

40|$|The {{requirements}} for active resistive wall mode (RWM) feedback control have been systematically investigated and established using highly reproducible current-driven RWMs in <b>ohmic</b> <b>discharges</b> in DIII-D. The unambiguous evaluation of active RWM feedback control {{was not possible}} in previous RWM studies primarily due to the variability of {{the onset of the}} pressure-driven RWMs; the stability of the pressure-driven RWM is thought to be sensitive to various passive stabilization mechanisms. Both feedback control specifications and physics {{requirements for}} RWM stabilization have been clarified using the current-driven RWMs in <b>ohmic</b> <b>discharges,</b> when little or no passive stabilization effects are present. The use of derivative gain on top of proportional gain is found to be advantageous. An effective feedback control system should be equipped with a power supply with bandwidth greater than the RWM growth rate. It is beneficial to apply a feedback field that is toroidally phase-shifted from the measured RWM phase {{in the same direction as}} the plasma current. The efficacy of the RWM feedback control will ultimately be determined by the plasma fluctuations on internal diagnostics, as well as on external magnetics. The proximity of the feedback coils to the plasma appears to be an important factor in determining the effectiveness of the RWM feedback coils. It is desirable that an RWM feedback control system simultaneously handles error field correction at a low frequency, along with direct RWM feedback at a high frequency. There is an indication of the influence of a second least stable RWM, which had been theoretically predicted but never identified in experiments. A preliminary investigation based on active MHD spectroscopic measurement showed a strong plasma response around 400 Hz where the typical plasma response associated with the first least stable RWM was expected to be negligible. Present active feedback control requirements are based on a single mode assumption, so the investigation of the second least stable RWM is of high interest...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{simulation}} of reflectometry measurement in Tore Supra <b>ohmic</b> <b>discharges,</b> for which the experimental observations as well as gyrokinetic non-linear computations predict a modification of turbulence spectrum between the linear (LOC) and the saturated ohmic confinement (SOC) regimes. Synthetic reflectometry simulations coupling full-wave computations with gyrokinetic data are carried out. This allows a direct comparison between the gyrokinetic non-linear predictions and experimental observations. The synthetic diagnostic results are found in a good agreement with the experimental findings; in particular, they reproduce well the quasi-coherent peak in the fluctuation spectrum of LOC regimes dominated by a trapped electron mode turbulence. It is also shown that such synthetic tools are valuable for (i) an enhanced interpretation of the reflectometry measurement (for instance, through {{the investigation of the}} 2 D effects) and (ii) {{a better understanding of the}} turbulence properties (for instance, via the analysis of its poloidal asymmetry) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{qualitative}} {{as well as}} quantitative {{simulation of}} experimentally observed plasma parameters in the detached regime proves to be difficult for several tokamaks. A series of <b>ohmic</b> <b>discharges</b> have been performed in ASDEX Upgrade and DIII-D at as similar as possible plasma parameters and at different line averaged densities, (n) over bar (e). The experimental data represent a set of well diagnosed discharges against which numerical simulations are compared. For the numerical modelling the fluid-code B 2. 5 coupled to the Monte Carlo neutrals transport code EIRENE is used. Only the combination of effects, such its geometry, drift terms, neutral conductance, increased radial transport and divertor target composition explains a significant fraction of the experimentally observed ion fluxes, Gamma(t), to {{the inner and outer}} target plates as a function of (n) over bar (e) in ASDEX Upgrade. The relative importance of the mechanisms leading to detachment differ in DIII-D and ASDEX Upgrade. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of Faraday rotation measurements {{shows that the}} safety factor on the magnetic axis stays well below one during the full sawtooth cycle. The current density profile has a unique shape during the sawtoothing plateau phase of <b>ohmic</b> <b>discharges,</b> independent of plasma current and magnetic field, when it is plotted in suitable normalized coordinates. The observation of short lasting spikes on the Faraday rotation signals {{can be interpreted as}} the formation of a transient current sheet during the sawtooth crash. Direct measurements of the magnetic amplitude of the internal kink mode with a fast polarimeter channel show that the displacement of the core because of the growing precursor mode stays much smaller than the q = 1 radius just prior to the sawtooth collapse. The versatile neutral beam heating system on Tokamak EXperiment for Technology Oriented Research (TEXTOR) allows the study of the influence of the plasma rotation on the sawtooth period, which has a minimum when the magnetohydrodynamic rotation in the tokamak frame is stopped...|$|R
40|$|Proceedings of the 19 th International Conference on Plasma-Surface Interactions in Controlled FusionInternational audienceA {{consistent}} {{description of}} scrape-off layer transport is built from multi-diagnostic observations in <b>ohmic</b> <b>discharges</b> in Tore Supra. Fast imaging reveals {{the existence of}} relatively large filamentary structures on the low field side {{but not on the}} high field side of the torus. These filaments can exist either on open or closed magnetic flux surfaces and have a finite parallel extent from the outboard midplane. Probe electrostatic turbulence measured {{at the top of the}} plasma corresponds to the ExB convection of density burst, understood as the signature of filament propagation. Independent experiments on time-averaged parallel flows measured with a Mach probe lead to a poloidal mapping of the strongly asymmetric radial flux. This flux is centered at the outboard midplane and its poloidal half width is about 50 °. The local turbulent flux on the top is consistent with the mapping...|$|R
