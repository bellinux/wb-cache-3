40|$|Reaching and {{grasping}} {{skills have}} been described to emerge from a dynamic interaction between intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The aims {{of the study were}} to investigate the effect of such intrinsic factors as age and Down syndrome on the development of reaching and grasping skills and on <b>overall</b> <b>gross</b> motor skill, and to test the influence of the <b>overall</b> level of <b>gross</b> motor skill on the development of reaching and grasping. Seven infants with Down syndrome (DS) and seven infants with typical development were assessed at the ages of 4, 5 and 6 months. The following variables were analyzed: straightness index, mean velocity, movement units and deceleration time (for reaching movements), grasping frequency and AIMS scores. Intrinsic factors such as age and DS were found to influence the development of reaching, grasping, and of the <b>overall</b> level of <b>gross</b> motor skill. The <b>overall</b> level of <b>gross</b> motor skill was observed to influence grasping. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} international monetary evolution {{over the past}} two decades is that <b>gross</b> international asset <b>positions</b> have skyrocketed to unprecedented levels. The phenomenon is most evident for the high-income industrial countries, but even gross private foreign asset positions for emerging countries are on a generally rising trend. The best-known data on the phenomenon are those assembled by Philip Lane and Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti, illustrated for a few countries in Chart 1. The chart shows the sum of gross foreign assets and liabilities divided by GDP. My thesis is that these ballooning <b>gross</b> <b>positions,</b> which of course reflect ballooning gross financial flows, have important implications for the functioning of the international monetary system. Some of these implications became painfully evident in the course of the global financial crises of 2007 - 10, but it has also become evident that economists’ knowledge of the determinants of gross financial flows and their repercussions is exceedingly slim. Relative to output, <b>gross</b> <b>positions</b> appear nonstationary based on the evidence to date, and most plausibly this is an artifact of rapid structural change. But we cannot predict with confidence when (or if) a stationary distribution of <b>gross</b> <b>position</b> ratios will emerge. Here is another area where mainstream macroeconomics has abstracted from real-world phenomena that are of first-order importance for economic stability and welfare. Falling political and technological barriers to international asset trade are of course consistent with the general trend, but we have few clues to explain asset positions that have quickly grown to multiples of GDP – far beyond what simple homogeneous-agent models of international risk sharing woul...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates whether, {{and through}} which channel, the active use of credit {{derivatives}} changes bank {{behavior in the}} credit market, and how this channel was affected by the crisis of 2007 – 2009. Our principal finding is that banks with larger <b>gross</b> <b>positions</b> in credit derivatives charge significantly lower corporate loan spreads, while banks׳ net positions are not consistently related to loan pricing. We argue that {{this is consistent with}} banks passing on risk management benefits to corporate borrowers but not with alternative channels through which credit derivative use may affect loan pricing. We also find that the magnitude of the risk management effect remained unchanged during the crisis period of 2007 – 2009. In addition, banks with larger <b>gross</b> <b>positions</b> in credit derivatives cut their lending by less than other banks during the crisis and have consistently lower loan charge-offs. In sum, our study is suggestive of significant risk management benefits from financial innovations that persist under adverse conditions – that is, when they matter most...|$|R
30|$|The {{evaluation}} of an order effect (Lokomat or PT first) may {{provide important insights}} into clinical integration of Lokomat therapy with gait-related PT. For example, if <b>overall</b> <b>gross</b> motor outcomes are better when Lokomat therapy is given before a block of PT (e.g., quality gains on the Lokomat {{can be used to}} set the stage for functional and participation gains with PT), this may be of value when determining the sequencing of blocks of therapy to achieve gait-related goals.|$|R

40|$|French suckler farmers need {{advice on}} the impact of the {{conversion}} to OF. To help them with their decision-making process, we constructed an LP model that optimises the farming system, taking OF constraints and nitrogen balance into account. According to the model, the shift to OF had a greater impact on a mixed crop-livestock farm system than on that of a grassland farm. As a result of the very high cost of organic N fertiliser and the necessity of maintaining the N balance, the shift to OF {{in the case of the}} mixed farm resulted in less emphasis on cereal and more emphasis on livestock. For this type of farm, a significant drop in its proportional costs due to extensification was sufficient to maintain the <b>overall</b> <b>gross</b> margin of the holding. For the extensive grassland farm, the production system remained almost the same after the conversion. In this case, only a slight area extensification was needed. Costs increased due to the higher price of the concentrates purchased, and a 30 % increase of the selling price of the meat was therefore necessary to maintain the <b>overall</b> <b>gross</b> margin...|$|R
