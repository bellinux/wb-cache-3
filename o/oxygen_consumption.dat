5|$|Mitochondria-mediated {{oxidative}} stress {{plays a role}} in cardiomyopathy in Type 2 diabetics. Increased fatty acid delivery to the heart increases fatty acid uptake by cardiomyocytes, resulting in increased fatty acid oxidation in these cells. This process increases the reducing equivalents available to the electron transport chain of the mitochondria, ultimately increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. ROS increases uncoupling proteins (UCPs) and potentiate proton leakage through the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), the combination of which uncouples the mitochondria. Uncoupling then increases <b>oxygen</b> <b>consumption</b> by the mitochondria, compounding the increase in fatty acid oxidation. This creates a vicious cycle of uncoupling; furthermore, even though <b>oxygen</b> <b>consumption</b> increases, ATP synthesis does not increase proportionally because the mitochondria is uncoupled. Less ATP availability ultimately results in an energy deficit presenting as reduced cardiac efficiency and contractile dysfunction. To compound the problem, impaired sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release and reduced mitochondrial reuptake limits peak cytosolic levels of the important signaling ion during muscle contraction. The decreased intra-mitochondrial calcium concentration increases dehydrogenase activation and ATP synthesis. So in addition to lower ATP synthesis due to fatty acid oxidation, ATP synthesis is impaired by poor calcium signaling as well, causing cardiac problems for diabetics.|$|E

The consequences of this approach on the exercise function of these patients was studied by examining the effects of progressive and steady-state bicycle exercise tests performed by 11 patients with right atrial (RA) -RV Fontan anastomoses, seven patients with RA-pulmonary artery (PA) Fontan anastomoses, 13 patients after repair of tetralogy of Fallot, and 34 normal control patients. All patients were in New York Heart Association class I. The exercise function of the patients undergoing RA-RV and RA-PA Fontan procedures were similar. They achieved peak work loads 60 % and 67 % of control and peak <b>oxygen</b> <b>consumptions</b> 60 % and 64 % of control, respectively.

In {{the model of the}} process, the mass transfer in the bioreactor for oxygen concentration in the gas phase (GP) and in the liquid phase (LP) is based on the dispersion model of the GP. In addition, perfect mixing in LP is included. Nine models were investigated for specific growth rate and specific <b>oxygen</b> <b>consumptions</b> rate: Monod, Mink, Tessier, Aiba, Andrews, Haldane, Luong, Edward and Han-Levenspiel. In regard to the parameter estimation, the worst observed error was used for all experiments as an objective function. This approach is a special case of multi objective parameter estimation problems allowing the parameter estimation problem to become a min-max problem. The results obtained (values of criteria, relative error and statistics λ) for the specific growth rate showed that the best fit to experimental data is achieved when applying the Mink model. In a combination a Mink, and Monod, Mink, Luong, Haldane, and Han-Levenspiel are used for specific <b>oxygen</b> <b>consumptions</b> rate.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to measure the effects of an {{amphetamine}} (methylphenidate) on exercise performance at a fixed rating of perceived exertion of 16 Methods: Eight elite cyclists ingested 10 mg Methylphenidate in a randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over trial. Results: Compared to placebo, subjects receiving methylphenidate cycled for ~ 32 % longer before power output fell to 70 % of the starting value. At the equivalent time at which the placebo trial terminated, subjects receiving methylphenidate had significantly higher power outputs, <b>oxygen</b> <b>consumptions,</b> heart rates, ventilatory volumes and blood lactate concentrations although EMG activity remained unchanged. Thus the ingestion of a centrally-acting stimulant allowed subjects to exercise for longer at higher cardio-respiratory and metabolic stress indicating the presence of a muscular reserve in the natural state.

5|$|Early {{research}} {{on the role of}} antioxidants in biology focused on their use in preventing the oxidation of unsaturated fats, which is the cause of rancidity. Antioxidant activity could be measured simply by placing the fat in a closed container with oxygen and measuring the rate of <b>oxygen</b> <b>consumption.</b> However, it was the identification of vitamins A, C, and E as antioxidants that revolutionized the field and led to the realization of the importance of antioxidants in the biochemistry of living organisms. The possible mechanisms of action of antioxidants were first explored when it was recognized that a substance with anti-oxidative activity is likely to be one that is itself readily oxidized. Research into how vitamin E prevents the process of lipid peroxidation led to the identification of antioxidants as reducing agents that prevent oxidative reactions, often by scavenging reactive oxygen species before they can damage cells.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the social {{behavior}} of H. suspectum, but they have been observed engaging in male-male combat, in which the dominant male lies on top of the subordinate one and pins it with its front and hind limbs. Both lizards arch their bodies, pushing against each other and twisting around in an effort to gain the dominant position. A wrestling match ends when the pressure exerted forces them to separate, although bouts may be repeated one after the other. These bouts are typically observed just before the mating season. Those with greater strength and endurance are thought to win more often and enjoy greater reproductive success. Although the Gila monster has a low metabolism and one of the lowest lizard sprint speeds, it {{has one of the highest}} aerobic scope values (the increase in <b>oxygen</b> <b>consumption</b> from rest to maximum metabolic exertion) among lizards, allowing them to engage in intense aerobic activity for a sustained period of time. Males have been observed to have higher aerobic scopes than females, presumably because of sexual selection for a trait advantageous in prolonged combat. The Gila monster may live up to 20 years in the wild, or 30 in captivity.|$|E
5|$|The lung/swim bladder {{originated}} as {{an outgrowth}} of the gut, forming a gas-filled bladder above the digestive system. In its primitive form, the air bladder was open to the alimentary canal, a condition called physostome and still found in many fish. The primary function is not entirely certain. One consideration is buoyancy. The heavy scale armour of the early bony fishes would certainly weigh the animals down. In cartilaginous fishes, lacking a swim bladder, the open sea sharks need to swim constantly to avoid sinking into the depths, the pectoral fins providing lift. Another factor is <b>oxygen</b> <b>consumption.</b> Ambient oxygen was relatively low in the early Devonian, possibly about half of modern values. Per unit volume, there is much more oxygen in air than in water, and vertebrates are active animals with a high energy requirement compared to invertebrates of similar sizes. The Devonian saw increasing oxygen levels which opened up new ecological niches by allowing groups able to exploit the additional oxygen to develop into active, large-bodied animals. Particularly in tropical swampland habitats, atmospheric oxygen is much more stable, and may have prompted a reliance of lungs rather than gills for primary oxygen uptake. In the end, both buoyancy and breathing may have been important, and some modern physostome fishes do indeed use their bladders for both.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} look into an energy balance in a daily life, it is necesary to {{estimate}} {{the amount of energy}} consumption satisfactorily without struggling against tables and complicated devices. a) BMR-BODY COMPOSITION : Assuming a total BMR is the sum of energies consumed in two parts, active and fat tissues, multiple regression analysis gives partial coefficients of 28 and 13 (kcal/kg/day) for active and fat tissues respectively.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the <b>oxygen</b> <b>consumptions</b> of various {{anthozoans}} are generally comparable with those of other invertebrates if the dry weights rather than the wet weights are considered (Brafield & Chapman, 1965). We have also suggested that the endoderm is probably the major site of oxygen uptake in pennatulids, associated with water movements {{into and out of the}} enteron. Three main sources of evidence support this view. First, the enteric water has a low oxygen concentration. Secondly, a fully contracted specimen consumes oxygen at a low rate, possibly due to a severely limited enteric circulation. Thirdly, measurements of the oxygen concentration of the water around a specimen in a closed vessel are sometimes inconsistent. Such variations might well be partly due to fairly regular movements of water in and out of the enteron, the inconsistent estimations having been made either just before or after an efflux of relatively deoxygenated enteric water. This source of inaccuracy in measuring con-sumptions can be avoided only if the oxygen concentration is measured continuously. Consequently experiments have been conducted in which a continuous-flow respiro-meter was used in an attempt to demonstrate whether a rhythmic enteric irrigatio...|$|R

Exclusion criteria are offered, for safety and to characterize subjects as free of disease which might alter their exercise performance. International agreement on these, or similar, criteria would be valuable. The budget must be adequate for prolonged recruitment before a study and for the liberal use of taxis during it.

40|$|We {{review the}} role of neuroglial {{compartmentation}} and transcellular neurotransmitter cycling during hypothalamic appetite regulation as detected by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS) methods. We address first the neurochemical basis of neuroendocrine regulation in the hypothalamus and the orexigenic and anorexigenic feed-back loops that control appetite. Then we examine the main Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy strategies {{that have been used}} to investigate appetite regulation. Manganese enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI), Blood oxygenation level dependent contrast (BOLD) and Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) have revealed Mn 2 +accumulations, augmented <b>oxygen</b> <b>consumptions</b> and astrocytic swelling in the hypothalamus under fasting conditions, respectively. High field 1 H magnetic resonance in vivo, showed increased hypothalamic myo-inositol concentrations as compared to other cerebral structures. 1 H and 13 C high resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) revealed increased neuroglial oxidative and glycolytic metabolism, as well as increased hypothalamic glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmissions under orexigenic stimulation. We propose here an integrative interpretation of all these findings suggesting that the neuroendocrine regulation of appetite is supported by important ionic and metabolic transcellular fluxes which begin at the tripartite orexigenic clefts and become extended spatially in the hypothalamus through astrocytic networks, becoming eventually MRI and MRS detectable...|$|R
25|$|The {{distribution}} of {{blood flow to}} the tissues is variable and subject to a variety of influences. When the flow is locally high, that area is dominated by perfusion, and by diffusion when the flow is low. The {{distribution of}} flow is controlled by the mean arterial pressure and the local vascular resistance, and the arterial pressure depends on cardiac output and the total vascular resistance. Basic vascular resistance is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, and metabolites, temperature, and local and systemic hormones have secondary and often localised effects, which can vary considerably with circumstances.
