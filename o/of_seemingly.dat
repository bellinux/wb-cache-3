5|$|Spotted hyenas {{dominate}} other hyena species wherever their ranges overlap. Brown hyenas encounter spotted hyenas in the Kalahari, {{where the}} brown species outnumbers the spotted. The two species typically encounter {{each other on}} carcasses, which the larger spotted species usually appropriate. Sometimes, brown hyenas will stand their ground and raise their manes while emitting growls. This usually has the effect <b>of</b> <b>seemingly</b> confusing spotted hyenas, which will act bewildered, though they will occasionally attack and maul their smaller cousins. Similar interactions have been recorded between spotted and striped hyenas in the Serengeti.|$|E
5|$|Timmons' career {{declined}} {{quickly in}} the 1960s, {{in part because of}} drug abuse and alcoholism and {{partly as a result of}} frustration at being typecast as a composer and player <b>of</b> <b>seemingly</b> simple pieces of music. In 1968 he made his second, final, recording for Milestone, Do You Know the Way? In the following year he played in a quartet led by Sonny Red, with Dexter Gordon on one of the saxophonist's temporary returns to the US from Europe, and in a trio backing vocalist Etta Jones. Timmons continued to play in the early 1970s, mostly in small groups or in combination with other pianists, and mainly in the New York area.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} shows that Zhou dynasty divination was grounded in cleromancy, the production <b>of</b> <b>seemingly</b> random numbers to determine divine intent. The Zhou yi provided a guide to cleromancy that used the stalks of the yarrow plant, {{but it is not}} known how the yarrow stalks became numbers, or how specific lines were chosen from the line readings. In the hexagrams, broken lines were used as shorthand for the numbers 6 (六) and 8 (八), and solid lines were shorthand for values of 7 (七) and 9 (九). The Great Commentary contains a late classic description of a process where various numerological operations are performed on a bundle of 50 stalks, leaving remainders of 6 to 9. Like the Zhou yi itself, yarrow stalk divination dates to the Western Zhou period, although its modern form is a reconstruction.|$|E

5|$|Leading {{off from}} the Great Hall are the family's private Drawing Room and Parlour. In the 16th and early 17th centuries, in a house such as Montacute, the Parlour was where the family would dine, {{possibly}} with some of their upper servants. It allowed them not only privacy from dining publicly in the hall, but also less state and pomp than if dining in the Great Chamber above. Like its grander cousin above, the Parlour also had an adjoining principal bed chamber, now the Drawing Room, originally known as the White Chamber and later as the Round Parlour. As fashions and uses changed, and privacy from servants became desirable, like the later Baroque state apartments, these ground-floor rooms lost their original purpose and became a series <b>of</b> <b>seemingly</b> meaningless drawing rooms. The National Trust installed an incongruous 18th-century fireplace from Coleshill House in the Drawing Room in the mid-20th century. It is now furnished in 18th-century style.|$|E
5|$|Sonnet 102 {{is one of}} the 154 sonnets {{written by}} English playwright and poet William Shakespeare. It {{is one of the}} Fair Youth sonnets, in which Shakespeare writes of an unnamed youth with whom the poet is enamored. Sonnet 102 is among a series <b>of</b> <b>seemingly</b> {{connected}} sonnets, from Sonnet 100 to Sonnet 103, in which the poet speaks of a silence between his Muse and himself. The exact date of writing is unknown, and there is contention among scholars about when they were written. Paul Hammond among other scholars believes that sonnets 61-103 were written primarily during the early 1590s, and then being edited or added to later, during the early 1600s (decade). Regardless of date of writing, it was published later {{along with the rest of}} the sonnets of the 1609 Quarto.|$|E

25|$|Veblen {{was deeply}} {{influenced}} by the Darwinian belief in the principle of causality. Unlike the German School, Darwin’s theories were systematically connected and explained series <b>of</b> <b>seemingly</b> disconnected phenomena throughout life. He developed a theoretical system of his own, inspired by Darwin’s theories, which recognized natural and observable forces, rather than divine and teleological ones. With this, Veblen also critiqued the neoclassical beliefs of economics, which stated that economics were passive and essentially inert. Upon this critique, Veblen built his theories of economics.|$|E
25|$|Studies on {{anaphora}} {{focus on}} the conditions for definite NP anaphora and avoid the problems with interpreting pronouns. Reinhart clarifies the difference between bound-variable pronouns (ie. bound-anaphora) and coreference (ie. the referential interpretation) and concludes that the bound-variable conditions apply to a number <b>of</b> <b>seemingly</b> unrelated phenomena, including reflexivization, quantified NP anaphora, and sloppy identity. She argues that the way pronouns can be interpreted and the times at which coreference cannot occur {{are determined by the}} syntax of the sentence.|$|E

The Arctic Lowlands and Hudson Bay lowlands comprise {{a substantial part of}} the geographic region often designated as the Canadian Shield (in contrast to the sole geologic area). The ground in the Arctic is mostly composed of permafrost, making construction difficult and often hazardous, and agriculture virtually impossible.|$|E

25|$|Sloth bears likely view {{humans as}} {{potential}} predators, as {{their reactions to}} them (roaring, followed by retreat or charging) {{are similar to those}} evoked in the presence of tigers and leopards. Their long claws, ideally adapted for digging at termite mounds, make adults less capable of climbing trees to escape danger, as are other bears such as Asian black bears. Therefore, sloth bears have seemingly evolved to deal with threats by behaving aggressively. For the same reason, brown bears can be similarly inclined, accounting for the relatively high incidence <b>of</b> <b>seemingly</b> nonpredatory aggression towards humans in these two bear species.|$|E
