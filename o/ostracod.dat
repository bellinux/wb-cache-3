5|$|Ostracods, a {{class of}} small {{crustaceans}} that were prevalent in the upper Maastrichtian, left fossil deposits {{in a variety of}} locations. A review of these fossils shows that <b>ostracod</b> diversity was lower in the Paleocene than any other time in the Cenozoic. Current research cannot ascertain, however, whether the extinctions occurred prior to, or during, the boundary interval.|$|E
5|$|The goblin shark feeds {{mainly on}} teleost fishes such as {{rattails}} and dragonfishes. It also consumes cephalopods and crustaceans, including decapods and isopods. Garbage {{has been recorded}} from the stomachs of some specimens. Its known prey includes bottom-dwelling species such as the blackbelly rosefish (Helicolenus dactylopterus), and midwater species such as the squid Teuthowenia pellucida and the <b>ostracod</b> Macrocypridina castanea rotunda. Thus, the goblin shark appears to forage for food both near the sea floor and far above it.|$|E
5|$|Epaulette {{sharks are}} preyed upon by larger fishes such as other sharks. Its {{coloration}} provides protective camouflage, while its epaulette is speculated {{to be an}} eyespot for distracting or deterring predators. Epaulette sharks are almost all parasitized by the praniza (parasitic) larval stage of gnathiid isopods. The larvae feed on blood and mostly attach to the skin around the cloaca and the claspers, though they are also found inside the mouth and on the gills. These parasites cause little damage and are not believed to adversely affect {{the health of the}} shark. Other parasites of this species include a species of myxosporean in the genus Kudoa, which infests the skeletal muscles, the hemogregarine protozoan Haemogregarina hemiscyllii, which infects the blood, the <b>ostracod</b> Sheina orri, which attaches to the gills, and the nematode Proleptus australis, which infests the stomach.|$|E

Freshwater <b>ostracods</b> must be hyperosmotic regulators while <b>ostracods</b> {{that live in}} hyperhaline water are hypoosmotic regulators. Some euryhaline species are hypoosmotic regulators in salinities above 8 g·l- 1 and hyperosmotic below. Hyperosmotic regulation in <b>ostracods</b> is partly dependent on salt consumed in the food but hypoosmotic regulation {{is dependent on the}} excretion of salt brought about by special cells located {{on the inside of the}} carapace...|$|R
40|$|The present work appertains to {{a series}} of {{investigations}} in the field of trophodynamics of water bodies conducted by the department of hydrobiology ”Mosrybvtuza” under the leadership of Prof. Director N. S. Gaevska. Usually with quantitative collections of benthos ostracoda are hardly taken account of. But with the employment of special methods it is possible to be convinced that they are encountered in massive numbers. The role of <b>ostracods</b> in the nutrition of fish is recognised as important by many authors. On the question of the feeding of <b>ostracods,</b> in the literature there are only the fragmentary indications about the occurrence in the gut of <b>ostracods</b> of algae (diatoms, desmids) and detritus. The study of the feeding of <b>ostracods</b> was conducted both by the method of dissecting the guts of <b>ostracods</b> taken from natural waters, and by the method of feeding <b>ostracods</b> under laboratory conditions with a variety of food objects. Moreover, with a view to revision of obtained quantitative data, for determination of food requirements of <b>ostracods</b> the respiration method was applied...|$|R
40|$|The oldest assumed <b>ostracods</b> {{appear in}} the fossil record from the Tremadocian Paltodus deltifer conodont Biozone. Although {{geographically}} widespread these early <b>ostracods</b> have no obvious Cambrian antecedents. Their first appearance at ca. 485 Ma contrasts with molecular evidence that suggests a much earlier (latest Proterozoic or Cambrian) origin for <b>ostracods.</b> Some Cambrian bivalved arthropods such as Altajanella and Vojbokalina, conventionally referred to the Bradoriida, have carapace morphologies that resemble Ordovician palaeocopid <b>ostracods,</b> though such a relationship is unproven without soft part anatomy. Evidence from preserved soft anatomy demonstrates that Bradoriida, such as Kunmingella, and Phosphatocopida, essentially the Cambrian 'ostracod' record of traditional usage, belong outside the Eucrustacea. Early Ordovician <b>ostracods</b> appeared first in shallow marine, oxygenated environments on shelf margins, in a similar setting to {{other elements of the}} 'Paleozoic fauna'. Their biodiversity was low (3 named genera and ca. 12 species), though some taxa such as Nanopsis and Eopilla achieved widespread dispersal between major Ordovician palaeocontinents. As bradoriids were largely extinct by the Late Cambrian, <b>ostracods</b> do not appear to have directly competed with them for shallow marine environments. The rapid colonisation of these settings by <b>ostracods</b> may have been facilitated by the available ecospace vacated by Bradoriida...|$|R
5|$|Much of the {{material}} written about her was aimed at children, and {{tended to focus on}} her childhood and early career. Much of it was also highly romanticised and not always historically accurate. She has been referenced in several historical novels, most notably in The French Lieutenant's Woman (1969) by John Fowles, who was critical of the fact that no British scientist had named a species after her in her lifetime. As her biographer, Shelley Emling, noted, this contrasted with some of the prominent geologists who had used her finds, such as William Buckland and Roderick Murchison, who ended up with multiple fossil species named after them. The only person who did name a species after her during her lifetime was the Swiss-American naturalist, Louis Agassiz. In the early 1840s, he named two fossil fish species after her—Acrodus anningiae, and Belenostomus anningiae—and another after her friend Elizabeth Philpot. Agassiz was grateful for the help the women had given him in examining fossil fish specimens during his visit to Lyme Regis in 1834. After her death, other species, including the <b>ostracod</b> Cytherelloidea anningi, and two genera, the therapsid reptile genus Anningia, and the bivalve mollusc genus Anningella, were named in her honour. In 2012, the plesiosaur genus Anningasaura was named for her, and the species Ichthyosaurus anningae was named for her in 2015.|$|E

He received his PhD in 1951. He then joined the lab of William D. McElroy, another student of Harvey’s, at Johns Hopkins University where he discovered both the stimulatory effects of coenzyme A and gating control by oxygen of firefly luminescence, and that flavin is a substrate in bacterial luminescence.|$|E

25|$|Hastings {{research}} on bioluminescence principally focused on bacterial luminescence (over 150 papers) and dinoflagellates (over 80 papers). In addition to bacteria and dinoflagellates, he, with his students and colleagues, also published {{papers on the}} biochemical and molecular mechanisms of light production in fungi, cnidarians, ctenophores, polychaetes, insects (fireflies and dipterans), <b>ostracod</b> crustaceans, millipedes, tunicates, and fishes with bacterial light organs. His laboratory produced the first evidence for quorum sensing in bacteria, early evidence of the molecular mechanisms of circadian clock regulation in organisms (first using dinoflagellate luminescence and then expanded to other cellular proteins), {{and some of the}} initial studies of energy transfer in green fluorescent proteins (GFP) in cnidarian luminescence.|$|E
25|$|Other {{luminescent}} systems: Early in {{his career}} Hastings developed techniques to quantify the level of oxygen required in a luminescent reaction for several different species including bacteria, fungi, fireflies and <b>ostracod</b> crustaceans. This work showed that oxygen gating is the mechanism for firefly flashing. In other work {{when he was in}} the McElroy lab he examined the basic biochemical mechanism of firefly luciferase and demonstrated that coenzyme A stimulates light emission. His lab first demonstrated that the green in vivo coelenterate bioluminescence occurs because of energy transfer from the luminescent molecule (aequorin), which alone emits blue light, to a secondary green emitter which they termed green fluorescent protein (GFP). Once characterized and cloned, GFP has become a crucial molecule used as a reporter and tagging tool for studying gene activation and developmental patterns. Osamu Shimomura, Martin Chalfie and Roger Tsien received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2008 for their work on this remarkable molecule.|$|E

25|$|The Romualdo Member of the Santana Formation is {{generally}} {{assigned to the}} Albian and thus the last section of the Early Cretaceous. The layers are aged to approximately 110 million years and {{to have come from}} a time in which the continents of Africa and South America were still connected with one another {{in the northern part of}} Brazil. The material of I. challengeri, not counting that of A. limai, likely hails from the Romualdo Member of the Santana Formation in Brazil. The holotype is SMNS 58022, from the Stuttgart State Museum of the Natural Sciences, and it consists of an incomplete skull, lacking the anterior (front) portion. The exact discovery site of the Irritator fossil skull is unknown; the fossil was collected by illegal fossil dealers. The skull and the matrix have been assigned to a rock of the Romualdo Member due to lithological characteristic. This classification was confirmed by microfossils of the <b>ostracod</b> Pattersoncypris. Questioning of local fossil dealers resulted in the identification of the discovery site near the village of Buxexé close Santana Do Cariri at the flank of the Chapada do Araripe, at a height of approximately 650 meters. Since rock from the Romualdo Member is indeed exposed there, this discovery site is regarded as very probable for the fossil.|$|E

2500|$|Exceptionally preserved, {{three-dimensional}} and phosphatised fossils {{from the}} Upper Cambrian Orsten of Sweden and the Cambrian/Ordovician boundary of Canada {{have been identified}} as pentastomids. Four fossil genera have been identified from the Cambrian so far: Aengapentastomum, Bockelericambria, Haffnericambria and Heymonsicambria. These fossils suggest that pentastomids evolved very early and raise questions about whether these animals were parasites at this time, and if so, on which hosts. Conodonts have sometimes been mentioned as possible hosts in this context. [...] A fifth genus, Invavita, is from Silurian-aged marine strata of England: fossil specimens of Invavita are found firmly attached to their <b>ostracod</b> hosts of the species Nymphatelina gravida.

2500|$|Uncertainty exists {{regarding}} {{the duration of}} the overall extinction and about the timing and duration of various groups' extinctions within the greater process. Some evidence suggests that there were multiple extinction pulses or that the extinction was spread out over a few million years, with a sharp peak in the last million years of the Permian. Statistical analyses of some highly fossiliferous strata in Meishan, Zhejiang Province in southeastern China, suggest that the main extinction was clustered around one peak. Recent research shows that different groups became extinct at different times; for example, while difficult to date absolutely, <b>ostracod</b> and brachiopod extinctions were separated by 670 to 1170 thousand years. In a well-preserved sequence in east Greenland, the decline of animals is concentrated in a period 10 to [...] long, with plants taking several hundred thousand additional years to show the full impact of the event. An older theory, still supported in some recent papers, is that there were two major extinction pulses 9.4 million years apart, separated by a period of extinctions well above the background level, and that the final extinction killed off only about 80% of marine species alive at that time while the other losses occurred during the first pulse or the interval between pulses. According to this theory one of these extinction pulses occurred {{at the end of the}} Guadalupian epoch of the Permian.|$|E
