25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 6 February 1942, lookouts on Christmas Island spotted an object out at sea, which <b>on</b> <b>closer</b> <b>inspection</b> {{turned out to be}} a carley float carrying the body of a Caucasian man wearing a blue boilersuit that had been sun-bleached white. The flesh of his right arm had been eaten away by fish, and his eyes and nose consumed by birds. Shrapnel was embedded in the float's outer covering, while the proliferation of marine growth indicated that it had been adrift for some time. As the island was under threat of Japanese invasion, after a brief examination, the body was buried in an unmarked grave near Flying Fish Cove. Evacuation began on 17 February with Japanese forces occupying the island on 23 March.|$|E

25|$|The {{internal}} {{evidence of}} religion in the text is meager. The phrase divina misericordia in the preface appears also in St. Augustine’s De civitate Dei, where the reference to divine mercy follows immediately after a passage on barbarian incursions. Marcellus and Augustine are contemporaries, {{and the use of the}} phrase is less a question of influence than of the currency of a shared Christian concept. Elsewhere, passages sometimes cited as evidence of Christianity <b>on</b> <b>closer</b> <b>inspection</b> only display the syncretism of the Hellenistic magico-religious tradition, as Stannard noted. Christ, for instance, is invoked in an herb-gathering incantation, but the ritual makes use of magico-medical practices of pre-Christian antiquity. A Judaeo-Christian reference — nomine domini Iacob, in nomine domini Sabaoth — appears as part of a magic charm that the practitioner is instructed to inscribe on a lamella, or metal leaf. Such “magic words” often include nonsense syllables and more-or-less corrupt phrases from “exotic” languages such as Celtic, Aramaic, Coptic, and Hebrew, and are not indications of formal adherence to a religion.|$|E
25|$|The African threadfish has {{the typical}} body {{structure}} of a large jack, with a distinctly angular, strongly compressed body. The major identifying feature of the species is its head profile, having a slight concavity near the eyes which distinguishes it from the African pompano. The dorsal profile of the fish is more curved than the ventral profile, and the body is deepest between {{the origins of the}} soft dorsal and soft anal fins. The first section of the dorsal fin consists of 5 to 7 visible spines, with the second section having one spine and 20 to 22 soft rays. The anal fin has two spines followed by a single spine and 18 or 19 soft rays. The pectoral fin is long and curved, extending beyond the junction of the straight and curved sections of the lateral line. Anterior to the caudal fin are two oblate keels {{on each side of the}} line of scutes. The body appears to be scaleless, but <b>on</b> <b>closer</b> <b>inspection</b> has minute, deeply embedded scales. The lateral line is strongly curved anteriorly, with a section of 6 to 11 scutes toward the tail. Juveniles and often adults have long, filamentous trailing first anal and dorsal fin spines, a trait of all members of Alectis. The species grows to at least 1 m in length.|$|E
500|$|Mermaids are {{included}} in the Shanhaijing (Classic of Mountains and Seas) compilation of Chinese geography and mythology, dating from the 4th century BC. A 15th-century compilation of quotations from Chinese literature tells of a mermaid who [...] "wept tears which became pearls". An early 19th-century book entitled Jottings on the South of China contains two stories about mermaids. In the first, a man captures a mermaid on the shore of Namtao island. She looks human in every respect except that her body is covered with fine hair of many colors. She can't talk, but he takes her home and marries her. After his death, the mermaid returns to the sea where she was found. In the second story, a man sees a woman lying on the beach while his ship was anchored offshore. <b>On</b> <b>closer</b> <b>inspection,</b> her feet and hands appear to be webbed.

500|$|The cathedral is [...] {{long and}} [...] wide. Standing [...] high, it was Ani's tallest structure. It is very large by {{standards}} of Armenian architecture. Architecture historian Murad Hasratyan suggests that its relatively large size and rich ornaments symbolize the revived Armenian statehood under the Bagratids. Christina Maranci suggested what {{she describes as}} an [...] "extremely tentative" [...] hypothesis that the relatively {{large proportion of the}} cathedral may have been a [...] "reflection of Trdat's memory of the vast continuous spaces" [...] of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, the dome of which he repaired. However, it is considered small if judged by a European standard, wrote H. F. B. Lynch and added, [...] "it is nevertheless a stately building. It bears the imprint of that undefinable quality, beauty, and can scarcely fail to arouse a thrill of delight in the spectator." [...] Luigi Villari wrote in his 1906 book on travels in the Caucasus: [...] "From a distance it seems to be merely a plain rectangular structure with no architectural pretensions.

500|$|Despite {{the death}} or capture of 77 out of 79 men, ZAPU, from its {{base in the}} Zambian capital, Lusaka, did not regard the {{incursion}} as a failure; on the contrary, its leaders were pleased that they had inflicted some casualties on the Rhodesian African Rifles. Buoyed by what they perceived as a success, they planned another operation {{to take place in}} northern Mashonaland: about 100 men—75 ZIPRA and 25 MK—were to infiltrate the Zambezi valley and establish a series of camps, including underground caches containing food, clothing, weapons and other equipment. They were instructed to avoid the Rhodesian Security Forces [...] "at all cost" [...] while they recruited local tribesmen to the nationalist cause and trained them. Once a sufficient indigenous force existed, they were to inform Lusaka, which would then coordinate a mass uprising. The aim was not to defeat the government forces, but rather to force the British military to intervene. If the operation were a success, the MK men were to be escorted to South Africa to begin similar activities. The group, which in the actual event numbered 126, crossed the Zambezi {{around the turn of the}} year, with 34 entering Rhodesia on 28 December 1967 and the remainder joining them on the nights of 3, 4 and 5 January 1968. The guerrillas busied themselves working their way into the country, setting up camps as they went, naming each [...] "Camp One", [...] "Camp Two" [...] and so on. After two and a half months in Rhodesia the ZIPRA cadres had created five bases, each further south than the next in an almost straight line pointing due south; the fifth was about halfway between Karoi and the border and nearly due east from Makuti. They remained undetected until unfamiliar bootprints were discovered by David Scammel, a game ranger, on a well-worn path, about the width of a [...] "four-lane highway", on 14 March 1968 around the midpoint between Camps Four and Five. <b>On</b> <b>closer</b> <b>inspection</b> Scammel found scraps of a sugar packet marked with Russian lettering.

2500|$|In {{terms of}} team selection, the {{intervening}} break {{up of the}} Soviet Union had precipitated some significant changes.

With the further addition of three former champions of Russia (Alexander Morozevich, Peter Svidler and Alexander Motylev) and two more players with Elo ratings in excess of 2700 (Evgeny Bareev and Alexander Grischuk), things were looking decidedly brighter than might have been expected. Indeed, the average Elo ratings of the two sides were separated by only one point and so a close contest was in prospect.|$|E
2500|$|Societas Domi Pacificae, known colloquially as [...] "Pacifica House," [...] is a present-day, {{self-described}} secret society, which nonetheless {{publishes a}} website and an email address.

2500|$|The cathedral's {{interior}} is extremely ornate, standing {{in sharp contrast}} with the façade. The interior was largely decorated by Mattia Preti, the Calabrian artist and knight, {{at the height of}} the Baroque period. Preti designed the intricate carved stone walls and painted the vaulted ceiling and side altars with scenes from the life of John the Baptist. Interestingly, the figures painted into the ceiling next to each column initially appear to the viewer as three-dimensional statues, but <b>on</b> <b>closer</b> <b>inspection</b> we see that the artist cleverly created an illusion of three-dimensionality by his use of shadows and placement. [...] Also noteworthy is the fact that the carving was all undertaken in-place (in-situ) rather than being carved independently and then attached to the walls (stucco). The Maltese limestone from which the Cathedral is built lends itself particularly well to such intricate carving. The whole marble floor is an entire series of tombs, housing about 400 Knights and officers of the Order. There is also a crypt containing the tombs of Grand Masters like Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, Claude de la Sengle, Jean Parisot de Valette, and Alof de Wignacourt.|$|E

2500|$|Due to some ampelographical similarities, Pinot blanc and Chardonnay {{were often}} mistaken {{for each other}} and even today share many of the same synonyms. The grape vines, leaves, and {{clusters}} look identical at first glance, but some subtle differences are seen. The most visible of these can be observed as the grapes are ripening, with Chardonnay grapes taking on a more golden-green color than Pinot blanc grapes. <b>On</b> <b>closer</b> <b>inspection,</b> the grapevine shows slight differences in the texture and length of the hairs on the vine's shoot, and the veins of a Chardonnay leaf are [...] "naked" [...] near the petiolar sinus – the open area where the leaf connects to the stem is delineated by veins at the edge. Cabernet Sauvignon {{is one of the few}} other Vitis vinifera grape vines to share this characteristic. This confusion between Pinot blanc and Chardonnay was very pervasive throughout northern Italy, where the two vines grew interspersed in the vineyard and were blended in winemaking. The Italian government did not dispatch researchers to try to distinguish the two vines until 1978. A similar situation occurred in France, with the two vines being commonly confused until the mid-19th century, when ampelographers began combing through the vineyards of Chablis and Burgundy, identifying the true Chardonnay and weeding out the Pinot blanc.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the book}} {{it is unclear}} if the first line begins with an [...] "M" [...] or [...] "W", but it is widely {{believed}} to be the letter W, owing to the distinctive difference when compared to the stricken letter M.

Although the last character in this line of text looks like an [...] "L", it is fairly clear <b>on</b> <b>closer</b> <b>inspection</b> of the image that this is formed from an 'I' and the extension of the line used to delete or underline that line of text.

In 1978, following a request from ABC-TV journalist Stuart Littlemore, Department of Defence cryptographers analysed the handwritten text. The cryptographers reported that {{it would be impossible to}} provide [...] "a satisfactory answer": if the text was an encrypted message, its brevity meant that it had [...] "insufficient symbols", from which a clear meaning could be extracted, and the text could be the [...] "meaningless" [...] product of a [...] "disturbed mind".|$|E
