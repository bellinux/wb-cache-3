5|$|In 1981, Lunney became {{manager of}} the space shuttle program, a {{high-level}} position where Lunney found himself responsible for setting the agenda for the developing program. His responsibilities were broad ones; they included supervising program planning, budgeting and scheduling; systems engineering; and mission planning. During the earlier shuttle flights he was even involved in determining whether the weather was suitable for launch, but in later years that responsibility was largely devolved to lower levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hierarchy.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 2503, Mohandar {{attended}} a meeting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hierarchy</b> to discuss Zamara, a missing preserver. There were none on Shakuras. A terran female, Rosemary Dahl, attended the meeting, along with Vartanil (a survivor from Aiur) and Executor Selendis; she {{was subject to}} protoss anti-female bias (due to their experiences with Sarah Kerrigan). Among the topics of conversation covered were Ulrezaj, a powerful dark archon and old enemy of the Khalai. During the meeting, Mohandar deferred to the judgment of Hierarch Artanis.|$|E
5|$|Ivan Vladislav left a mixed heritage, varying from a {{reputation}} of being a ruthless murderer to a hero defending his country as best as he could. The descendants of Ivan Vladislav entered the Byzantine nobility and rose to the highest ranks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hierarchy.</b> Two women of his family became empresses of the Byzantine Empire and others became military commanders or high-ranking officials. He was an ancestor of the Byzantine emperor John II Komnenos.|$|E
5|$|Sabah (together {{with its}} {{neighbour}} of Sarawak) {{has a certain}} level of autonomy in administration, immigration, and judiciary which differentiates it from the West Malaysian Peninsula states. The Yang di-Pertua Negeri sits at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hierarchy</b> followed by the state legislative assembly and the state cabinet. It is the head of state although its functions are largely ceremonial. The chief minister is the head of government as well the leader of the state cabinet. The legislature is based on the Westminster system and therefore the chief minister is appointed based on his or her ability to command the majority of the state assembly. While local authorities being fully appointed by the state government owing to the suspension of local elections by the federal government. Legislation regarding state elections are within the powers of the federal government and not the state. The assembly meets at the state capital, Kota Kinabalu. Members of the state assembly are elected from 73 constituencies which are delineated by the Election Commission of Malaysia and may not necessarily result in constituencies of same voter population sizes. A general election representatives in the state assembly must be held every five years, when the seats are subject of universal suffrage for all citizens above 21 years of age. Sabah is also represented in the federal parliament by 25 members elected from the same number of constituencies. The present elected state and federal government posts are held by Barisan Nasional (BN), a coalition of parties which includes United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), Sabah Progressive Party (SAPP), United Pasokmomogun Kadazandusun Murut Organisation (UPKO), Parti Bersatu Rakyat Sabah (PBRS), Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS), Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), and Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA).|$|E

25|$|In summary, {{the mental}} working models that {{underlie}} attachment styles appear to contain information about self {{and information about}} others organized into relational schemas. The relational schemas are themselves organized into a three-tier hierarchy. The highest level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hierarchy</b> contains relational schemas for a general working model that applies to all relationships. The middle level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hierarchy</b> contains relational schemas for working models that apply to different types of relationships (e.g., friends, parents, lovers). The lowest level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hierarchy</b> contains relational schemas for working models of specific relationships.|$|E

25|$|Unlike other deep architectures, such as DBNs, {{the goal}} is not to {{discover}} the transformed feature representation.
