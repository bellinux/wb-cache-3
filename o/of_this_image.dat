25|$|Since worship <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>image</b> has been, {{and to a}} {{large extent}} still is, clandestine, most rituals are {{performed}} in altars constructed at the homes of devotees. Recently shrines to this image have been mushrooming in public. The one on Dr. Vertiz Street in Colonia Doctores is unique in Mexico City because it features an image of Jesús Malverde along with Santa Muerte. Another public shrine is in a small park on Matamoros Street very close to Paseo de la Reforma.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrances to}} the Crypt and the Upper Basilica, {{both of which}} are built on top of Massabielle, are far above ground level. To {{facilitate}} access, two enormous ramps were constructed, which curve down either side of Rosary Square. The image of the entrance of the Rosary Basilica, flanked by the two ramps and surmounted by the spires of the Upper Basilica, {{has become one of the}} iconic symbols of Lourdes, and a stylised form <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>image</b> has been adopted by the Domain itself as its logo.|$|E

25|$|Russian coronations {{took place}} in Moscow, the country's ancient capital. The new ruler made a great processional {{entrance}} on horseback into the city, accompanied by multiple cavalry squadrons, his consort (in an accompanying carriage) and the pealing of literally thousands of church bells. The new Tsar stopped at the Chapel of Our Lady of Iveron, home of the Icon of the Blessed Virgin of Iveron, {{one of the most}} revered icons in Moscow. It was a tradition with Russian Tsars that every entry to the Kremlin be marked by the veneration <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>image.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{replacement}} of Bellerophon as the tamer and rider of Pegasus {{by the more}} familiar culture hero Perseus was not simply an error of painters and poets of the Renaissance. The transition was a development of Classical times which became the standard image during the Middle Ages and has been adopted by the European poets of the Renaissance and later: Giovanni Boccaccio's Genealogia deorum gentilium libri (10.27) identifies Pegasus as the steed of Perseus, and Pierre Corneille places Perseus upon Pegasus in Andromède. Modern representations <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>image</b> include sculptor Émile Louis Picault's 1888 sculpture Pegasus.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1960s, Pickford often {{received}} visitors only by telephone, {{speaking to}} them from her bedroom. Buddy Rogers often gave guests tours of Pickfair, including views of a genuine western bar Pickford had bought for Douglas Fairbanks, and a portrait of Pickford in the drawing room. A print <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>image</b> now hangs in the Library of Congress. In addition to her Oscar as best actress for Coquette (1929), Mary Pickford received an Academy Honorary Award in 1976 for lifetime achievement. The Academy sent a TV crew to her house to record her short statement of thanks – offering the public a very rare glimpse into Pickfair Manor.|$|E

25|$|A {{few days}} later, on December 7, Webb engaged two hobbyists, Edgar Van Horn and Ernest Howatt, to {{photograph}} the carcass for posterity. At least two photographs were taken, one of the lateral view {{and one of the}} anterior view, showing the apparent arm stumps. The latter also included a man, likely DeWitt Webb himself, for scale. As the images were over-exposed, they were never published. These photographs were for a long time considered lost, and only drawings based on them, made by Alpheus Hyatt Verrill and published in the American Naturalist of April 1897, were known. However, one of the original images, showing the lateral view, was obtained by Gary Mangiacopra in 1994. It is clear that one of Verrill's drawings was based on this photograph. A simplified drawing <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>image</b> also appeared in the Hartford Daily Running of February 18, 1897.|$|E
25|$|The Clock Tower was {{conceived}} {{within five years}} of the completion of Herne Bay's first pier of 1832, when the town was {{in the throes of}} its initial popularity and development. Herne Bay historian Mike Bundock suggests a possible inspiration for the unusual design of this tower. On the back of 31 Marine Terrace, next door to Mrs Thwaytes' holiday residence, was a Royal Exchange Assurance lead firemark badge which bore a picture of the Royal Exchange tower, designed by Edward Jarman in 1721. Mrs Thwaytes was already familiar with the Royal Exchange tower, as she had lived close to it during her marriage. In 1836, possibly inspired by the success of the nearby pier and the grandeur <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>image,</b> Mrs Thwaytes requested the young architect Edwin James Dangerfield (1807–1879) of London and Herne Bay to draw a plan of a tower in the style of a Grecian temple with a clock at the top.|$|E
25|$|The mirror stage {{describes}} {{the formation of}} the Ego via the process of objectification, the Ego being the result of a conflict between one's perceived visual appearance and one's emotional experience. This identification is what Lacan called alienation. At six months, the baby still lacks physical co-ordination. The child is able to recognize themselves in a mirror prior to the attainment of control over their bodily movements. The child sees their image as a whole and the synthesis <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>image</b> produces a sense of contrast with the lack of co-ordination of the body, which is perceived as a fragmented body. The child experiences this contrast initially as a rivalry with their image, because the wholeness of the image threatens the child with fragmentation—thus the mirror stage gives rise to an aggressive tension between the subject and the image. To resolve this aggressive tension, the child identifies with the image: this primary identification with the counterpart forms the Ego. Lacan understands this moment of identification as a moment of jubilation, since it leads to an imaginary sense of mastery; yet when the child compares their own precarious sense of mastery with the omnipotence of the mother, a depressive reaction may accompany the jubilation.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{relatively}} straightforward way to appreciate why a polarizer which creates a given handedness of circularly polarized light also passes that same handedness of polarized light. First, given the dual usefulness <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>image,</b> begin by imagining the circularly polarized light displayed at the top as still leaving the quarter-wave plate and traveling toward the left. Observe that had the horizontal component of the linearly polarized light been retarded by a quarter of wavelength twice, which would amount to a full half wavelength, the result would have been linearly polarized light that was at a right angle to the light that entered. If such orthogonally polarized light were rotated on the horizontal plane and directed back through the linear polarizer section of the circular polarizer it would clearly pass through given its orientation. Now imagine the circularly polarized light which has already passed through the quarter-wave plate once, turned around and directed back toward the circular polarizer again. Let the circularly polarized light illustrated at the top now represent that light. Such light is going to travel through the quarter-wave plate a second time before reaching the linear polarizer and in the process, its horizontal component {{is going to be}} retarded a second time by one quarter of a wavelength. Whether that horizontal component is retarded by one quarter of a wavelength in two distinct steps or retarded a full half wavelength all at once, the orientation of the resulting linearly polarized light will be such that it passes through the linear polarizer.|$|E

500|$|Given Harrison's marital problems, and the {{generally}} unfavourable reception given to his tour and album, author Gary Tillery describes his new relationship with Olivia Arias as [...] "he one bright {{spot in the}} problematic year". Having met Arias in Los Angeles in October, Harrison used a photo of her on the face label for side two of the Dark Horse LP. Writing in 1981, NME critic Bob Woffinden viewed the inclusion <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>image,</b> combined with the more upbeat message of side-two songs such as [...] "Ding Dong" [...] and [...] "Far East Man", as Harrison ushering in Arias, his future wife, and farewelling Boyd.|$|E

500|$|Reflecting the lyrical {{content of}} {{songs such as}} [...] "The Lord Loves the One" [...] and [...] "Living in the Material World", Tom Wilkes's design for the album artwork contrasted a devout spiritual {{existence}} with life in the material world.

Part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>image</b> was also used on the LP's side-one face label; in addition, it appeared opposite the words to [...] "The Lord Loves the One" [...] in the lyrics section of the Material World songbook, published by the Charles Hansen sheet music company.|$|E
500|$|Though {{her early}} {{releases}} presented a conservative, quiet image, since {{as early as}} 2003 Koda has adopted a sexier and more provocative style.

She has also won many fashion awards such as, the [...] "Best Jeanist Award" [...] and the title of [...] "Nail Queen" [...] yearly since 2006. Since the rise in her popularity, Koda has lent her face and songs to many advertisements. In 2006 and 2007, Oricon named Koda as the top selling artist of the year.

500|$|In Spring City, Pearl Penalosa is one {{of several}} superheroes. Most superheroes, {{including}} Pearl, have public identities and are treated like celebrities. They have agents, product endorsements, and a bureaucracy that schedules their working shifts to ensure proper coverage. Because she has been single for five years after a public relationship with popular superhero Captain Steel, she has been adopted as a model of abstinence. Partly because <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>image,</b> [...] Pearl has been nominated for [...] "Best Heroine of the Year" [...] in the 77th annual Superhero Awards. On Thursday night, one week before the award ceremony, Pearl is out with her friends and fellow superheroes Olivia Arancina and Jennifer Janus. At Olivia’s insistence, the three women visit a fortune teller who tells them that within seven days, Jennifer will [...] "receive what she has given" [...] and Pearl will “find true love". The final prediction excites Olivia and Jennifer, but Pearl dismisses it as a scam.|$|E

500|$|The Reapers {{went through}} many designs. Originally, they were {{supposed}} to be [...] "men in cowls" [...] based on the Grim Reaper; the final design retains some <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>image</b> with its [...] "scythe-like tail". The original design was deemed too similar to creatures seen in [...] "The End of the World", and so were reworked into something more [...] "otherworldly". They were not originally intended to fly. There was also discussion of how much they should resemble animals as opposed to the Grim Reaper; the end result is a mixture of the two approaches. The final design had a [...] "shark quality", bat wings, and a mouth influenced by the praying mantis. Vulture sound effects were used for its screech. The model was made over two months, being finished at the end of February 2005 rather than at the beginning of January as scheduled. The special effects team then had two or three weeks to complete the [...] "40-odd shots" [...] of the completely CGI Reapers in the episode.

500|$|A {{distinct}} type of iconographic {{image of}} Ganesha shows {{him with a}} single human-looking shakti (Sanskrit: [...] ). According to Ananda Coomaraswamy, the oldest known depiction of Ganesha with a shakti of this type dates from the sixth century. The consort lacks a distinctive personality or iconographic repertoire. [...] According to Cohen and Getty, the appearance of this shakti motif parallels the emergence of tantric branches of the Ganapatya cult. [...] Getty mentions a specific cult of [...] "Shakti Ganapati" [...] that {{was set up by}} the Ganapatyas involving five distinct forms. [...] Of the thirty-two standard meditation forms for Ganesha that appear in the Sritattvanidhi (...) , six include a shakti. A common form of this motif shows Ganesha seated with the shakti upon his left hip, holding a bowl of flat cakes or round sweets. [...] Ganesha turns his trunk to his own left in order to touch the tasty food. [...] In some of the tantric forms <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>image,</b> the gesture is modified to take on erotic overtones. Some tantric variants of this form are described in the [...] Tantram. [...] Ananda Coomaraswamy says that the first paintings of Ganesha with a shakti is from the sixth century.|$|E
500|$|She {{moved into}} the teen-pop genre, as she felt that {{restyling}} herself to match the image of Spears and Aguilera would help remake her career.

Her new image was promoted through appearances on many events, where Simpson wore revealing outfits. The development <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>image</b> coincided with the production and release of her second studio effort, Irresistible.

[...] According to Terri Doughtery, author of People in the News: Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey, Simpson hoped her new image would bring more attention to the power of her voice. [...] "It's not just me singing about being in love. I also have heartbreak songs and girls telling off guys songs. It's going to take me a while to recoup [...] this album, because we spent a lot of money on it," [...] Simpson said to Entertainment Weekly.|$|E
