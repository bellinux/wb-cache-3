5|$|On June 4, {{playing at}} Connie Mack Stadium against the Phillies, Koufax walked Richie Allen {{on a very}} close full-count pitch in the fourth inning. Allen, who was thrown <b>out</b> <b>trying</b> to steal second, was the only Phillie to reach base that day. With his third no-hitter in three years, Koufax became only the second pitcher of the modern era (after Bob Feller) to pitch three no-hitters.|$|E
5|$|Crowley's {{inheritance}} {{was running}} <b>out.</b> <b>Trying</b> to earn money, {{he was hired}} by George Montagu Bennett, the Earl of Tankerville, to help protect him from witchcraft; recognising Bennett's paranoia as being based in his cocaine addiction, Crowley took him on holiday to France and Morocco to recuperate. In 1907, he also began taking in paying students, whom he instructed in occult and magical practice. Victor Neuburg, whom Crowley met in February 1907, became his sexual partner and closest disciple; in 1908 the pair toured northern Spain before heading to Tangier, Morocco. The following year Neuburg stayed at Boleskine, where he and Crowley engaged in sadomasochism. Crowley continued to write prolifically, producing such works of poetry as Ambergris, Clouds Without Water, and Konx Om Pax, as well as his first attempt at an autobiography, The World's Tragedy. Recognising the popularity of short horror stories, Crowley wrote his own, some of which were published, and he also published several articles in Vanity Fair, a magazine edited by his friend Frank Harris. He also wrote Liber 777, a book of magical and Qabalistic correspondences that borrowed from Mathers and Bennett.|$|E

Arthur also gave the company no favours, and it fell into financial trouble in the 1850s. The company was, however, successful in growing potatoes, finding the island's climate and soil well suited to that and oats, peas, wheat, and grass for hay to feed livestock.|$|E

In the fifth, Warfield reached base with one out on an error by Moore. Carr walked, and Mackey doubled off the right field wall, driving in Warfield. Judy Johnson {{grounded}} to Bell, and Carr was thrown <b>out</b> <b>trying</b> to get back to third after attempting to score on the play. Thomas flied out to end the inning, and Hilldale was up, 2–0.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} against New Zealand, Australia batted and first and started poorly. Duffin {{came in to}} join Poulton with the score at 3/20 in the sixth over. The pair put on a {{partnership}} of 30, the largest in Australia's innings, but {{they were unable to}} lift the run rate substantially; their stand took 45 balls. Poulton was <b>out</b> <b>trying</b> to loft a ball over cover, and two balls later, Duffin was bowled by Kate Broadmore's first ball, leaving Australia at 5/51 in the 13th over. Only Poulton managed a solitary boundary and Duffin ended with 14 from 24 balls. Australia eventually reached 8/106 after a late burst of scoring. New Zealand ended on 6/103, sealing an Australian win by three runs.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Hunt Morgan {{began his}} career in {{genetics}} as a saltationist, and started <b>out</b> <b>trying</b> to demonstrate that mutations could produce new species in fruit flies. However, the experimental work at his lab with the common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, which helped establish the link between Mendelian genetics and the chromosomal theory of inheritance, demonstrated that rather than creating new species in a single step, mutations increased the genetic variation in the population. By 1912, after years of work on the genetics of fruit flies, Thomas Hunt Morgan showed that these insects had many small Mendelian factors (discovered as mutant flies) on which Darwinian evolution could work as if variation was fully continuous. The way was open for geneticists to conclude that Mendelism supported Darwinism.|$|E

25|$|On 7 August 2008 Harmison {{returned}} to the England Test team for the Fourth Test match versus South Africa. He took two wickets for 49 runs in helping England to dismiss South Africa for 194 {{on the first day}} of the match. Harmison's first ball (the first ball of the match) nearly took a wicket (see picture). In England's first innings Harmison hit a career high Test match score of 49 not out (59 balls,8 fours). He ran teammate Monty Panesar <b>out</b> <b>trying</b> to reach 50. After the Test series on 21 August, Harmison came out of ODI retirement after being persuaded by the new England captain, Kevin Pietersen. On his ODI return versus South Africa on 22 August, he took two wickets for 43 runs, this was crucial in England winning the match.|$|E
25|$|The Venetians grew worried {{after the}} Peace and soon set <b>out</b> <b>trying</b> to {{reconcile}} with Skanderbeg. On August 20, 1463, an alliance against the Ottoman Empire was concluded between the two. The {{terms of the}} alliance were that: Venetian contingents and subsidies {{to be given to}} Skanderbeg to help in his future wars against the Ottomans; the amount of subsidy would be determined by the Grand Council and the Abbot of Rotezo and not by the Venetian proveditors in Albania; Venetian ships and auxiliary ships were to be present in Albanian waters to protect the population; if Venice concluded peace with Ottoman Empire, Albania was to be included; Skanderbeg's son became a Venetian nobleman; Skanderbeg would given refuge in Venetian territory in case he was driven out of Albania; his pension arrears would be paid by Venice and not by its proveditors. Later that year, the Pope ordered his crusade to begin and hostilities between Albania-Venice and the Ottomans would resume.|$|E
25|$|After captain Alex Blackwell {{elected to}} bat, but New Zealand started more effectively. Their opening fast bowler Nicola Browne bowled her quota of four overs {{straight}} through, taking 2/11. She removed opener Elyse Villani, for six, caught at cover. Blackwell was then out for 0, cutting {{into the hands}} of Devine in the gully. Shelley Nitschke had earlier been trapped leg before wicket by Sian Ruck for three. This was following by a partnership of 30 between Leah Poulton and Jess Cameron, but they were unable to lift the run rate substantially; their stand took 45 balls. Poulton was <b>out</b> <b>trying</b> to loft a ball over cover, and two balls later, Cameron was bowled from Kate Broadmore's first ball, leaving Australia at 5/51 in the 13th over. Only Poulton managed a solitary boundary. Wicket-keeper Alyssa Healy scored 10 from as many balls, but was then run out attempting a second run after being dropped by Sara McGlashan.|$|E

25|$|The Washington Post {{reported}} that amid a slower-than-anticipated recovery for left fielder Jayson Werth from a bruised foot suffered the previous month, Werth said on July 18 that scans had revealed a fracture {{of his first}} metatarsal bone {{as well as a}} bone bruise. The Nationals made a series of roster moves on July 18 as well: Turner was designated for assignment for the second time of the month, just a day after being re-added to the roster and without appearing in a game in that brief stint, while Adams and Gott were optioned back to Class-AAA Syracuse. Those roster moves cleared room for the Nationals to activate Doolittle and Madson as well as select the contract of Edwin Jackson from Syracuse, tabbing Jackson to start the first of their two-game interleague series against the Angels. The changes to the pitching staff left the Nationals unusually heavy on left-handed relievers, with four in the bullpen (Doolittle, Grace, Pérez, and Enny Romero) to three right-handers (Albers, Joe Blanton, and Madson). Making his first start for the Nationals since the 2012 season, Jackson pitched seven innings and gave up two earned runs, both on solo home runs, to earn his first win of the season. Doolittle gave up his first hit of the year to a left-handed hitter, a double high off the wall by Kole Calhoun, but nailed down the save after allowing an earned run in his first appearance for Washington. Harper came a close call at second base away from hitting for the cycle in the July 18 contest, as he was called <b>out</b> <b>trying</b> to stretch a single into a double while going 4-for-4 overall with a home run and a triple.|$|E

500|$|During {{his time}} at Somerset, he was known for [...] " [...] a match with his {{cracking}} strokes in an hour."

In the best Somerset tradition, he was always after the bowling, and in the best Australian tradition, he always relished a fight." [...] But he also adapted his style to suit English pitches: in an early innings for Somerset, he was <b>out</b> <b>trying</b> to hook a ball from Trevor Bailey. [...] "The hook, he decided, was a stroke to be used sparingly on English pitches... McCool was constantly amending his technique that season , whenever he spotted a flaw in his method. Again and again he held the Somerset batting together. Nothing in his previous experience had equipped him for the task of holding up a losing side in a damp English summer." ...|$|E
