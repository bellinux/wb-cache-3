500|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Nigel Dick and filmed on June 14 and 15, 1999 at the Redondo Beach, California. Spears conceptualized the video's treatment, and explained during an interview with MTV in 1999 that [...] "it would be cool {{to be in a}} club, and we're dorky waitresses, and we break <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>start</b> dancing." [...] At the time, Spears expected that the video would take her [...] "to the next level". To promote the film Drive Me Crazy, actors Adrian Grenier and Melissa Joan Hart were invited to make cameo appearances in the video, since the song had been included on the film's soundtrack, however, Grenier did not want to participate. Dick commented on the issue, saying, [...] "I was given instructions to ring him up and make sure he appeared in the video. I said, 'You know what, Adrian, I just think it would be great for your career, and Britney's a great girl and she's fun to work with.' Eventually he came around." [...] Dick also revealed that he was impressed by the singer's work ethic, adding that she [...] "came to the set completely rehearsed." [...] The music video premiered on MTV's Making the Video special that aired on July 18, 1999.|$|E
500|$|Mardas {{gave the}} Beatles regular reports of his progress, {{but when they}} {{required}} their new studio in January 1969, during the Get Back project that became Let It Be, they discovered an unusable studio: no 72-track tape deck (Mardas had reduced it to 16 tracks), no soundproofing, no talkback (intercom) system, and not even a patch bay to run the wiring between the control room and the 16 speakers that Mardas had fixed haphazardly to the walls. The only new piece of sound equipment present was a crude mixing console which Mardas had built, which looked (in the words of Martin's assistant, Dave Harries) like [...] "bits of wood and an old oscilloscope". The console was scrapped after just one session. Harrison said it was [...] "chaos", {{and that they had}} to [...] "rip it all <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>start</b> again," [...] calling it [...] "the biggest disaster of all time." [...] Harrison's suspicions of Mardas' competence had been raised when he saw him wandering around in a white coat with a clipboard, and considered the possibility that Mardas had [...] "just read the latest version of Science Weekly, and used its ideas". Mardas later stated that he had never been in the basement of Savile Row, as the studio equipment he was building was being tested in Apple Electronics, at Boston Place, Marylebone.|$|E

500|$|Reviews for Xtort {{were almost}} universally positive. Jon Wiederhorn of Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "the {{heaviest}} and most danceable disc in [...] 12-year career" [...] while giving it an A-. Heidi MacDonald of CMJ New Music Monthly compared Xtort to getting {{hit with a}} wrecking ball, saying, [...] "When KMFDM does what it does best, {{it is the best}} at what it does, namely jack-hammer industrial anthems that hit with stunning precision and power." [...] Sandy Masuo of Rolling Stone called the album [...] "the product of a first-rate lineup," [...] and praised the album's diversity, saying, [...] "The 10 tracks on Xtort are grounded in KMFDM's smart synthesis of metallic crunch, swiveling rhythms and sophisticated electronics, but it's the organic elements that give the album a zesty twist." [...] Kevin M. Williams of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the album an [...] "essential" [...] rating, and said, [...] "KMFDM has some major mojo working with Xtort".Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic was less enthusiastic, saying, [...] "it would be nice to hear [...] branch <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>start</b> to experiment a little bit more", and commenting that while Xtort did not sound much different from previous releases, [...] "KMFDM sounds as good as they ever have, and several tracks rank among their best." [...] Liz Armstrong of the Daily Herald thought the guest contributors added significant differences to their individual songs.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1970s, Ashcroft {{remained}} {{a pillar of}} the RSC but when Peter Hall succeeded Olivier {{as director of the}} National Theatre in 1973 he persuaded her to appear there from time to time. She also appeared at the Royal Court in Duras's The Lovers of Viorne (1971) in the role of a schizophrenic killer, a performance that the young Helen Mirren found so accomplished that [...] "I just wanted to rush <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>start</b> all over again". Many were surprised when Ashcroft appeared with Richardson at the Savoy in 1972 in what was by all appearances a conventional West End drawing room comedy, Lloyd George Knew My Father, by William Douglas-Home, but the two stars revealed unexpected depths in their characters.|$|E
2500|$|The Shuttle was {{originally}} conceived to operate somewhat like an airliner. After landing, the orbiter would be checked <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>start</b> [...] "mating" [...] {{to the rest}} of the system (the ET and SRBs), and be ready for launch in as little as two weeks. Instead, this turnaround process usually took months; Atlantis set the pre-Challenger record by launching twice within 54 days, while Columbia set the post-Challenger record of 88 days. Naturally, the Shuttle program's goal of returning its crew to Earth safely conflicts with the goal of a rapid and inexpensive payload launch. Furthermore, because in many cases there are no survivable abort modes, many pieces of hardware simply must function perfectly and so must be carefully inspected before each flight. The result is high labor cost, with around 25,000 workers in Shuttle operations and labor costs of about $1 billion per year.|$|E

60|$|This {{was not the}} case. The {{latest news}} which Vladimir Brusiloff had had from Russia had been {{particularly}} cheering. Three of his principal creditors had perished in the last massacre of the bourgeoisie, and a man whom he owed for five years for a samovar {{and a pair of}} overshoes had fled the country, and had not been heard of since. It was not bad news from home that was depressing Vladimir. What was wrong with him was {{the fact that this was}} the eighty-second suburban literary reception he had been compelled to attend since he had landed in the country on his lecturing tour, and he was sick to death of it. When his agent had first suggested the trip, he had signed on the dotted line without an instant's hesitation. Worked out in roubles, the fees offered had seemed just about right. But now, as he peered through the brushwood at the faces round him, and realized that eight out of ten of those present had manuscripts of some sort concealed on their persons, and were only waiting for an opportunity to whip them <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>start</b> reading, he wished that he had stayed at his quiet home in Nijni-Novgorod, where the worst thing that could happen to a fellow was a brace of bombs coming in through the window and mixing themselves up with his breakfast egg.|$|E
60|$|The {{grasshopper}} warblers gave {{me so much}} {{pleasure that}} I was often {{at the spot where}} they had their little colony of about half-a-dozen pairs, and where I discovered they bred every year. At first I used to go to any bush where I had caught sight of a bird and sit down within a few yards of it and wait until the little hideling's shyness wore off, and he would come <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>start</b> reeling. Afterwards I always went straight to the same bush, because I thought the bird that used it as his singing-place appeared less shy than the others. One day I spent a long time listening to this favourite; delightedly watching him, perched on a low twig on a level with my sight, and not more than five yards from me; his body perfectly motionless, but the head and wide-open beak jerked from side to side in a measured, mechanical way. I had a side view of the bird, but every three seconds the head would be jerked towards me, showing the bright yellow colour of the open mouth. The reeling would last about three minutes, then the bird would unbend or unstiffen and take a few hops about the bush, then stiffen and begin again. While thus gazing and listening I, by chance, met with an experience of that rare kind which invariably strikes the observer of birds as strange and almost incredible--an example of the most perfect mimicry in a species which has its own distinctive song and is not a mimic except once in a while, and as it were by chance. The marsh warbler is our perfect mocking-bird, our one professional mimic; while the starling in comparison is but an amateur. We all know the starling's ever varying performance in which he attempts a hundred things and occasionally succeeds; but even the starling sometimes affects us with a mild astonishment, and I will here give one instance.|$|E

They had to prise me off the greens when it got too dark to see, and then {{we went back to the}} house. I was walkin' ahead with my Lord Marshalton talkin' beginners' golf. (I was the man who ought to have been killed by rights.) We cut 'cross lots through the woods to Flora's Temple--that place I showed you this afternoon. Lundie and Walen were, maybe, twenty or thirty rod behind us in the dark. Marshalton and I stopped at the theatre to admire at the ancestral yew-trees. He took me right under the biggest--King Somebody's Yew--and while I was spannin' it with my handkerchief, he says, [...] "Look heah!" [...] just as if it was a rabbit--and down comes a bi-plane into the theatre with no more noise than the dead. My Rush Silencer is the only one on the market that allows that sort of gumshoe work.... What? A bi-plane--with two men in it. Both men jump <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>start</b> fussin' with the engines. I was starting to tell Mankeltow--I can't remember to call him Marshalton any more--that it looked as if the Royal British Flying Corps had got on to my Rush Silencer at last; but he steps out from under the yew to these two Stealthy Steves and says, [...] "What's the trouble? Can I be of any service?" [...] He thought--so did I--'twas some of the boys from Aldershot or Salisbury. Well, sir, from there on, the situation developed like a motion-picture in Hell. The man on the nigh side of the machine whirls round, pulls his gun and fires into Mankeltow's face. I laid him out with my cleek automatically. Any one who shoots a friend of mine gets what's comin' to him if I'm within reach. He drops. Mankeltow rubs his neck with his handkerchief. The man the far side of the machine starts to run. Lundie down the ride, or it might have been Walen, shouts, [...] "What's happened?" [...] Mankeltow says, [...] "Collar that chap." ...|$|E
