5|$|A {{reversible}} {{cellular automaton}} is a cellular automaton {{in which every}} configuration has a unique predecessor. That is, it is a regular grid of cells, each containing a state drawn from a finite set of states, with a rule for updating all cells simultaneously based on the states <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors,</b> such that the previous state of any cell before an update can be determined uniquely from the updated states of all the cells. The time-reversed dynamics of a reversible cellular automaton can always be described by another cellular automaton rule, possibly on a much larger neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} month they traveled east, hoping {{to locate the}} Mississippi and return to Canada. During their travels, the group encountered the Caddo, who gave the Frenchmen a map depicting their territory, that <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors,</b> {{and the location of}} the Mississippi River. The Caddo often made friendship pacts with neighboring peoples and extended their policy of peaceful negotiation to the French. While visiting the Caddo, the French met Jumano traders, who reported on the activities of the Spanish in New Mexico. These traders later informed Spanish officials of the Frenchmen they had seen.|$|E
25|$|The {{apparent}} {{similarity of}} the Phrygian language to Greek and its dissimilarity with the Anatolian languages spoken by most <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors</b> is also taken as {{support for a}} European origin of the Phrygians. Phrygian continued to be spoken until the 6th century AD, though its distinctive alphabet was lost earlier than those of most Anatolian cultures.|$|E

25|$|In 1132, {{remnants}} of the Liao dynasty from Manchuria entered Xinjiang, fleeing the rebellion <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors,</b> the Jurchens. They established a new empire, the Qara Khitai, which ruled over both the Kara-Khanid-held and Uyghur-held parts of the Tarim Basin for the next century. Although Khitan and Chinese were the primary languages of administration, the empire also administered in Persian and Uyghur.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to requiring that certain foods be eaten for sacred purposes, the Israelite diet {{was shaped by}} religious practices which prohibited the consumption of certain foods, {{both in terms of}} the animals permissible for eating, and the manner of their preparation. The cuisine of the Israelites thus differed from that <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors</b> in significant ways. For example, ancient Mesopotamian recipes describe foods cooked with animal blood and milk added to meat stews; this would have been avoided by the ancient Israelites.|$|E
25|$|When the American Revolutionary War {{began in}} the 1770s, Fairfielders {{were caught in the}} crisis as much as, if not more than, the rest <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors</b> in Connecticut. In a {{predominantly}} Tory section of the colony, the people of Fairfield were early supporters of the cause for independence. Throughout the war, a constant battle was being fought across Long Island Sound as men from British-controlled Long Island raided the coast in whaleboats and privateers. Gold Selleck Silliman, whose home still stands on Jennings Road, was put in charge of the coastal defenses.|$|E

25|$|Encouraged by Jessie, the Morse family held {{relatively}} formal nightly {{discussions about}} crops, animals, education, religion, and most frequently about politics. Like many <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors,</b> {{the family was}} Progressive and discussed ideas championed by Robert M. La Follette, Sr., {{a leader of the}} Progressive movement who served as Wisconsin's governor from 1900 to 1906 and thereafter {{as a member of the}} U.S. Senate. During these family discussions, Morse developed debating skills and strong opinions about political corruption, corporate domination, labor rights, women's suffrage, education, and, on a personal level, hard work and sobriety.|$|E
25|$|Probably {{the biggest}} reason behind the spread of Islam in the region was the very weak {{presence}} of the Church in Bosnia at the time. The old competition between the Catholic and Bosnian churches (along with the Orthodox Church in certain areas) contributed to a very weak and disorganized religious structure in much of Bosnia. To many Bosnians religion {{was a combination of}} traditions and superstitions. Compared to the well-funded and organized religious institutions <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors,</b> it was relatively easy for Bosnians to switch from their folk-Christianity to Islam. It is significant that the only other European region under Ottoman control where {{a large segment of the}} population adopted Islam was Albania; also home to competing Christian sects. Some taxes on Muslims and orthodox Vlachs were also lighter than those on other rayah. The Hatt-ı Şerif attempted to eliminate this uneven taxation.|$|E
25|$|Goodness, he believed, came {{more from}} {{practice}} and discipline than from innate human nature. He believed {{that one should}} distance oneself from the wicked, stating that such association increases disposition to vice. Anger, while difficult to control, must be mastered in order for one to be rational. Those who take pleasure from the disasters <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors</b> fail to understand that their fortunes {{are tied to the}} society in which they live, and they rob themselves of any joy of their own. Democritus believed that happiness was a property of the soul. He advocated a life of contentment with as little grief as possible, which he said could not be achieved through either idleness or preoccupation with worldly pleasures. Contentment would be gained, he said, through moderation and a measured life; to be content one must set their judgment on the possible and be satisfied with what one has—giving little thought to envy or admiration. Democritus approved of extravagance on occasion, as he held that feasts and celebrations were necessary for joy and relaxation. He considers education to be the noblest of pursuits, but cautioned that learning without sense leads to error.|$|E

500|$|In 1641, the Pawtuxet {{settlers}} {{complained to}} the Massachusetts authorities <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors</b> in Warwick, the so-called Gortonites led by Samuel Gorton. [...] Gorton had been causing disturbances {{for several years and}} had already been evicted from several places for creating difficulties which centered around his religious beliefs, insubordination towards the magistrates, refusal to pay taxes, and his dealings with and treatment of the Indians. [...] The Massachusetts authorities replied that they were unable to help because the Pawtuxet settlement fell under the jurisdiction of neither the Massachusetts Bay Colony nor the Plymouth Colony. [...] As a result, William Arnold and other Pawtuxet settlers subjected themselves to the Massachusetts government in 1642, with Arnold appointed to keep the peace. [...] This separation from Providence lasted for 16 years.|$|E

500|$|As {{with other}} social mammals, the calls reveal the sex and {{identity}} of the individual. [...] Dialects have also been detected between communities. [...] The male trill call, part of the male mating display, is much like a bird song {{in terms of its}} ordered sequence of broadband frequency modulated syllables, ranging between 13 and 35kHz in pitch and lasting 0.3 to 0.9seconds, repeating up to 1.5 times per minute. [...] Each locality has its own theme of trill calls that is distinct from those of neighboring communities, and resident males produce individually distinct trill calls within that theme. [...] These calls are not genetically programmed. [...] During play, young males produce early attempts at the trill call, which show high degrees of variability. [...] Research has shown that the male mouse lemurs consciously manipulate the dialect to resemble those <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors,</b> when transferred from their home to a new neighborhood. [...] This may reduce aggression and foster social acceptance for emigrant males as they transfer from their natal group upon maturity.|$|E
500|$|Beat poets {{during the}} 1950s wore longer hairstyles. [...] By 1960, a small [...] "beatnik" [...] {{community}} in Newquay, Cornwall, England (including a young Wizz Jones) had {{attracted the attention}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors</b> for growing their hair to a length past the shoulders, resulting in a television interview with Alan Whicker on BBC television's Tonight series. The 1960s also introduced The Beatles, who started a more widespread longer hair trend. The social revolution of the 1960s led to a renaissance of unchecked hair growth, and long hair, especially on men, was worn as a political or countercultural symbol or protest and {{as a symbol of}} masculinity. This cultural symbol extended to several Western countries in the Americas, Western Europe, South Africa, and Australia. Specific long hairstyles such as dreadlocks have been part of counterculture movements seeking to define other alternative cultures and lifestyles since this time. Longer hair in general remained popular due to the youth rebellion throughout the liberal decade of the 1960s. The long hair trend grew with the spread of the hippie movement in the 1960s and, in the 1970s, longer hair styles would become the norm among men and women.|$|E

2500|$|Historians have {{determined}} that in some villages, Jewish families survived the Holocaust by living under assumed identities as Christians — with the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors,</b> who did not betray their identities.
