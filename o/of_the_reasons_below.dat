50|$|A uniformed constable may {{stop any}} vehicle {{at any time}} under section 163 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. However, if a constable wishes, {{for one of the}} reasons given below, to stop all {{vehicles}} or certain vehicles selected by any criterion, then they must do so under the power granted by section 4 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. A road check is normally only authorised by a police officer of the rank of superintendent or above, in which case the restrictions given in the second column apply. However, if it appears to an officer below the rank of superintendent that a road check is required (for one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>below)</b> as a matter of urgency, then he may authorise it himself. In this case, the conditions given in the second column do not apply.|$|E

A large number of girls who come to Angeles tend to be provincial, especially from Samar, Leyte and Visayas, having seen their friends live a better life because of their job in the prostitution industry.
