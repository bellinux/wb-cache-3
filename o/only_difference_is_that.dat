5|$|The {{most common}} {{electrode}} holder is a semiautomatic air-cooled holder. Compressed air circulates {{through it to}} maintain moderate temperatures. It is used with lower current levels for welding lap or butt joints. The second {{most common type of}} electrode holder is semiautomatic water-cooled, where the <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> water takes the place of air. It uses higher current levels for welding T or corner joints. The third typical holder type is a water cooled automatic electrode holder—which is typically used with automated equipment.|$|E
25|$|In Years 7–11, the <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{trousers}} are worn, and in Year 12 a {{white shirt}} is worn.|$|E
25|$|A moulded door has {{the same}} {{structure}} as that of flush door. The <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the surface material is a moulded skin made of MDF. Skins can also be made out of hardboards.|$|E
3000|$|The <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> p {{value of}} the α_ 1 [...] in the female {{participation}} rate equation was just above 0.05.|$|R
50|$|Is {{quite similar}} to the {{canonical}} sequence, the <b>only</b> <b>differences</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the sequence of amino acids in 195th-218th position (RPPAPSLRATRHSRAAAVDPTPAA) is substituted by proline (P).|$|R
50|$|Mona's Queen was {{virtually}} identical to her older sister, King Orry. The <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the main mast crosstrees on Mona’s Queen {{were higher than}} those on King Orry.|$|R
25|$|Scottish seiners are {{basically}} configured {{the same as}} anchor seiners. The <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> whereas the anchor seiner has the coiler and winch mounted transversally amidships, the Scottish seiner has them mounted transversally in the forward part of the vessel.|$|E
25|$|The {{definitions}} and notations used for Tait-Bryan angles {{are similar to}} those described above for proper Euler angles (geometrical definition, intrinsic rotation definition, extrinsic rotation definition). The <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Tait–Bryan angles represent rotations about three distinct axes (e.g. x-y-z, or x-y’-z″), while proper Euler angles use the same axis for both the first and third elemental rotations (e.g., z-x-z, or z-x’-z″).|$|E
25|$|Articulated SLC Type – This is a {{slightly}} less-stylish {{variation of the}} articulated tram, also manufactured at Nonapukur. The <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> its front and back are overhanging, and narrow towards the ends. It also had an improved engine, but was suitable for local routes. Later, this type was also used on express routes. Some early cars were also well-maintained.|$|E
60|$|There she was, {{sitting in}} the same arm-chair, looking as massive as ever. The <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> she didn't uncover the teeth, as she had done the first time.|$|R
5000|$|Almost {{the same}} rules as Season 3 but the <b>only</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> the Iron card has been {{replaced}} by the Cat card (since the Cat replaces the Iron in the MONOPOLY board games.) ...|$|R
50|$|In 1970 Mine a Million was rebranded as The Business Game. Aside {{from the}} rebranding, the <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> 'The Business Game' {{came in a}} smaller box, and the board was folded into thirds rather than in half.|$|R
25|$|However, one aircraft, an Airbus A321 under {{registration}} N578UW, {{has been}} left unpainted in the US Airways livery, as one of American's heritage aircraft. The <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the actual US Airways logo {{near the front of}} the fuselage has been replaced with the American Airlines logo; however, the rest of the aircraft remains identical to US Airways livery.|$|E
25|$|SLC Type – This {{modified}} variation has a pivot, and is less stylish than articulated trams; {{it is also}} manufactured at Nonapukur. The <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{its front}} and back are straight, not slanted. It was also introduced as a higher-speed tram, with an improved engine, designed to run on express routes. Later, this type enjoyed more general use.|$|E
25|$|Foreign {{citizens}} and stateless students are enrolled {{on the same}} principle as Serbian citizens are. The <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they are provided free Serbian classes (in case they don't already know Serbian) prior to enrollment so they could understand lectures in school. If the student is from a European country, they can be provided the lectures of mother tongue and culture, free or with compensation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{inability}} to outrun evil. Scarpetta's moving to Key West temporarily, {{in an attempt}} to escape the killer, is similar to Beryl's running to a safe haven before being murdered. The <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Scarpetta managed to defeat the killer.|$|R
5000|$|Nine {{years of}} intense {{fighting}} by international troops {{did nothing to}} stop the production. In fact it only became worse.The <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it has <b>been</b> pushed out beyond the central populated zone to less governed badlands beyond the Helmand canal.|$|R
50|$|The ballpark's {{dimensions}} were cozy but symmetrical, {{giving a}} nearly equal chance to right and left-handed batters in the Home Run Derby series. The <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the left field wall was 14.5 ft high, whereas the right field fence was only 9 ft high.|$|R
25|$|Types Ia, IIa, and IIIa {{have the}} same {{composition}} as types I, II, and III. The <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> in Ia, IIa, and IIIa, an air-entraining agent is ground into the mix. The air-entrainment must meet the minimum and maximum optional specification found in the ASTM manual. These types are only available in the eastern United States and Canada, only on a limited basis. They are a poor approach to air-entrainment which improves resistance to freezing under low temperatures.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} painting of Satavahana period that has survived at Ajanta is the Chhadanta Jataka in Cave No.10, but that too is {{in a few}} fragments. It is a painting of an elephant named Bodhisattva with six tusks. Also a mythological story is related with. The human figures {{both male and female}} are typically Satavahanas, almost identical with their counterparts on Sanchi Gateways so far as their physiognomy, the costume and jewellery are concerned. The <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Sanchi figures have shed some their weight.|$|E
25|$|Sauron {{appears as}} a boss in Lego Dimensions with the voice {{provided}} by Steve Blum once again. He is one the villains serving Lord Vortech, and he takes over Superman's hometown, Metropolis. He is stopped by Batman, Gandalf, and Wyldstyle, with Gandalf noting that his power is significantly decreased since {{he is not in}} his home realm, and is cleansed of the Locate Keystone. Similar to the movie, his armour crumbles up when he is defeated. The <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he crumbles into a cube that is teleported back to Lord Vortech's lair.|$|E
50|$|The {{settlement}} developed itself {{quickly because}} of the peat trade. Drenthe therefore acquired the nickname Drents California. The <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> there <b>was</b> no gold in the ground, but peat. Important {{for the development of}} the village <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> situated along the canal called the Verlengde Hoogeveensevaart.|$|R
5000|$|SR 368 {{made its}} debut in 1934. It was {{originally}} routed along the exact alignment that it utilizes today. The <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> at the time, the route SR 368 met at its southern terminus was known as SR 32, which {{a few years later}} would become US 33.|$|R
50|$|They did {{the same}} work {{throughout}} their lives as the earlier B18 1/4, even at the beginning being seen on goods, mixed, suburban and long distance passenger trains. The <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> at the beginning, when they were brand new, and in best condition, they were preferred for the long distance passenger work.|$|R
25|$|One of {{a number}} of {{different}} grips is illustrated to the right. Essentially the <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the middle and index fingers are split and come down {{on each side of the}} seam. This causes more drag on the ball as it leaves the hand, slowing down the delivery. Slower balls are also bowled by using the off break grip and finger action used by off spinners. A slower delivery may also be achieved – less commonly – by using a leg spin grip and wrist action or by supporting the upper aspect of the ball with only one finger or with the knuckles.|$|E
25|$|To {{make the}} {{comparison}} more obvious, the opera {{is set in}} a pseudo-Wild West America, with Mahagonny itself placed somewhere far from the rest of civilization. America was the land of unbridled capitalism, the frontier just as much so. The <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> bourgeois civility and civilization has yet to occupy the frontier, and thus there is no hiding the nature of capitalism beneath the facade of gentlemanly conduct. In Mahagonny, the characters are prostitutes, lumberjacks, criminals, and the like. Not one of them comes from the moneyed class, and yet the same system of exploitation was set up, but in a more naked manner. Instead of seducing a woman's love with power and influence, the residents of Mahagonny pay for a prostitute. But in Mahagonny, poverty is not just a condition the poor bring upon themselves, but a crime to be punished. Thus, Brecht and Weill tried to display capitalism as the meatgrinder they believed it to be.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} said that the small figurine was the only {{preserved}} statue of Khufu. This is not quite correct. Excavations at Saqqara in 2001 and 2003 revealed a pair of terracotta statues depicting a lion goddess (possibly Bastet or Sakhmet). On her feet two figures of childlike kings are preserved. While the right figurine can be identified as king Khufu by his Horus name, the left one depicts king Pepy I of 6th dynasty, called by his birth name. It {{is obvious that the}} figurines of Pepy were added to the statue groups in later times, because they were placed separately and at a distance from the deity. This is inconsistent with a typical statue group of the Old Kingdom—normally all statue groups were built as an artistic unit. Both statue groups are worked out similarly to each other (both have the same size and scale), the <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> one lion goddess holds a scepter. The excavators point out that the statues were restored during the Middle Kingdom, after they were broken apart. However, it seems that the reason for a restoration lay more in an interest for the goddess, than for a royal cult around the king figures: their names were covered with gypsum.|$|E
50|$|Yes, he was. He {{knew how}} to handle the people the same way I did. He also used similar shark fishing {{techniques}} based on my methods. The <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I used hand held harpoons after field-testing harpoon guns and discovering that they didn't work: the dart would pull out after hitting the fish.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were two}} {{models of the}} Classic Cybiko. Visually, the <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the {{original}} version had a power switch on the side, whilst the updated version used the [...] "escape" [...] key for power management. Internally, {{the differences between the}} two models were in the internal memory, and the location of the firmware.|$|R
30|$|Uniformed {{services}} were initially {{covered by the}} new system under standard rules. The <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> the newcomers since 1999 were covered. The rest stayed in their own previous system. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> changed in 2002 for reasons stemming from their commanders’ strong willingness to have the “pension” system as a device to implement staff policy.|$|R
500|$|While in {{his first}} several Doctor Who appearances, Jack {{did not have a}} set costume, Torchwood {{established}} a continual look for Jack which recalled that of his first Doctor Who appearance. The design has been described as [...] "an iconic piece of sci-fi culture". A writer for Wired attributes much of Jack's appeal to the coat: [...] "I think it has lots to do with that coat he always wears. Coats are cool, just like fezzes and bow ties and Stetsons. The <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Captain Jack doesn't ever tell you his coat is cool. It just is." [...] In fact, in her essay [...] "Fashioning Masculinity and Desire", Sarah Gilligan attributes Torchwoods popularity—as well as that of the character—to the costume. She credits the greatcoat with helping to fashion the character's masculinity, and argues that Jack's costume creates its own discourse [...] "through which costume drama and Post Heritage cinema's escapism flows".|$|E
500|$|... {{which is}} the {{homogenization}} of the usual equation of a circle in the affine plane. [...] Therefore, studying circles in the above sense is nearly equivalent to studying circles in the conventional sense. [...] The <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the above sense permits degenerate circles which are the union of two lines. [...] The non-degenerate circles are called smooth circles, while the degenerate ones are called singular circles. [...] There {{are two types of}} singular circles. [...] One is the union of the line at infinity [...] with another line in the projective plane (possibly the line at infinity again), and the other is union of two lines in the projective plane, one through each of the two circular points. [...] These are the limits of smooth circles as the radius [...] tends to [...] and , respectively. [...] In the latter case, no point on either of the two lines has real coordinates except for the origin [...]|$|E
500|$|Fonville noted at {{the time}} that, in his opinion, speed was more {{essential}} than beef and weight in the shot put. Speaking about his technique, Fonville said, [...] "You concentrateand then you just try to explode across the circle." [...] His coach, Ken Doherty, described Fonville as [...] "one of the hardest working, most studious athletes" [...] he had ever coached. Doherty also added that Fonville's technique distinguished him from most shot putters: [...] "Fonville drives completely across the ring in one continuous motion. Previously, most shotputters made their initial hop and hesitated before their final drive. ... Any track coach looking at him, would recognize all the points of good form. The <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he has unusual speed and quicknessand he is the greatest competitor I've ever coached." [...] One columnist described Fonville's steady improvement from his freshman year in 1946 through his junior year in 1948 and concluded: [...] "Small as shot-putters go, Fonville is the greatest in {{the long history of}} sensational [...] heavers." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{conservative}} estimate of villagers who suffered scalping is 90%, {{but it could}} have been as high as 100%. [...] This is based on skeletal remains that exhibit cuts on their skulls indicative of scalping. Men, women, and children <b>were</b> scalped; the <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> younger children <b>were</b> cut higher on the skull than other groups.|$|R
50|$|The Three Mile Island Unit 2 {{was also}} a {{pressurized}} water reactor constructed by B&W, similar to Unit 1. The <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> TMI-2 <b>was</b> slightly larger with a net generating capacity of 906 MWe, compared to TMI-1, which delivers 819 MWe. Unit 2 received its operating license on February 8, 1978, and began commercial operation on December 30, 1978.|$|R
5000|$|In 2001, the University of Bordeaux asked 54 {{undergraduate}} students to test {{two glasses of}} wine: one red, one white. The participants described the red as [...] "jammy" [...] and commented on its crushed red fruit. The participants failed to recognize <b>that</b> both wines <b>were</b> from the same bottle. The <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> one had <b>been</b> colored red with a flavorless dye.|$|R
