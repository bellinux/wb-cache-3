50|$|In {{practice}} the ideal current source {{is replaced by}} a current mirror, which is less ideal in two ways. First, its AC resistance is large, but not infinite. Second, the mirror requires a small voltage drop to maintain operation (to keep the output transistors of the mirror in active mode). As a result, the current mirror does limit the allowable <b>output</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>swing,</b> but this limitation is much less than for a resistor, and also does not depend upon the choice of bias current, leaving more flexibility than a resistor in designing the circuit.|$|E
50|$|For voltage amplification, {{the range}} of allowed <b>output</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>swing</b> in this {{amplifier}} is tied to voltage gain when a resistor load RC is employed, as in Figure 1. That is, large voltage gain requires large RC, and that in turn implies a large DC voltage drop across RC. For a given supply voltage, the larger this drop, the smaller the transistor VCB and the less output swing is allowed before saturation of the transistor occurs, with resultant distortion of the output signal. To avoid this situation, an active load can be used, for example, a current mirror. If this choice is made, the value of RC in the table above is replaced by the small-signal output resistance of the active load, which is generally at least {{as large as the}} rO of the active transistor in Figure 1. On the other hand, the DC voltage drop across the active load has a fixed low value (the compliance voltage of the active load), much less than the DC voltage drop incurred for comparable gain using a resistor RC. That is, an active load imposes less restriction on the <b>output</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>swing.</b> Notice that active load or not, large AC gain still is coupled to large AC output resistance, which leads to poor voltage division at the output except for large loads RL ≫ Rout.|$|E
50|$|Clamp {{circuits}} {{were also}} used to speed up cutoff transitions. When the transistor is cutoff, the output is similar to an RC circuit that exponentially decays to its final value. As the circuit gets closer to its final value, there is less current available to charge the capacitor, so the rate of approach lessens. To reach 90 percent of the final value takes about 2.3 time constants. Cutoff clamping reduces the <b>output</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>swing</b> but makes the transition faster. Clamping the collector voltage to 63 percent of the final value allows a factor of two speed increase.|$|E

50|$|For Figure 3, a large op amp gain {{achieves}} {{the maximum}} Rout {{with only a}} small RE. A low value for RE means V2 also is small, allowing a low compliance voltage for this mirror, only a voltage V2 larger than the compliance voltage of the simple bipolar mirror. For this reason this type of mirror also is called a wide-swing current mirror, because it allows the <b>output</b> <b>voltage</b> to <b>swing</b> low compared to other types of mirror that achieve a large Rout only {{at the expense of}} large compliance voltages.|$|R
50|$|The {{catalyst}} {{requires that}} the fuel/air mixture is stoichiometric. This means that the mixture is neither rich or lean, it is exactly 14,7 kg air to 1 kg gasoline (Lambda=1). That is why the system is equipped with an oxygen sensor in the forward part of the exhaust system. The sensor is connected to pin 23 in the ECU and {{is grounded in the}} ECU via pin 47. The exhaust fumes pass the oxygen sensor. The content of oxygen in the exhaust fumes is measured through a chemical reaction, this results in an <b>output</b> <b>voltage.</b> If the engine runs rich (Lambda lower than 1) the <b>output</b> <b>voltage</b> would be more than 0.45 V and if the engine runs lean (Lambda higher than 1) the <b>output</b> <b>voltage</b> would be less than 0.45 V. The <b>output</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>swings</b> about 0.45 V when Lambda passes 1. The ECU continuously corrects the injection duration so that Lambda=1 is always met. To be able to function the oxygen sensor needs to be hot, this requirement is meet by electrically pre heat the sensor. The pre heating element is fed by B+ via fuse 38 and the main relay, the sensor is grounded in the ECU via pin 50. The ECU estimates the temperature on the exhaust gases (EGT) {{on the basis of the}} engine load and the engines RPM. At high EGT the electrical pre heating is disconnected. The lambda correction is masked during the engines first 640 revolutions after start if the coolant temperature exceeds 18℃ (64F) at load ranges over idle and under WOT or 32℃ (90F) at idle.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the domain}} of MOSFET circuits, [...] "bootstrapping" [...] is {{commonly}} used to mean pulling up the operating point of a transistor above the power supply rail. The same term has been used somewhat more generally for dynamically altering the operating point of an operational amplifier (by shifting both its positive and negative supply rail) {{in order to increase}} its <b>output</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>swing</b> (relative to the ground). In the sense used in this paragraph, bootstrapping an operational amplifier means [...] "using a signal to drive the reference point of the op-amp's power supplies". A more sophisticated use of this rail bootstrapping technique is to alter the non-linear C/V characteristic of the inputs of a JFET op-amp in order to decrease its distortion.|$|E
5000|$|Consider a positive-going swing: As long as {{the input}} {{is less than the}} {{required}} forward VBE drop (≈ 0.65 V) of the upper NPN transistor, it will remain off or conduct very little - this is the same as a diode operation as far as the base circuit is concerned, and the output voltage does not follow the input (the lower PNP transistor is still off because its base-emitter diode is being reverse biased by the positive-going input). The same applies for the lower transistor but for a negative-going input. Thus, between about ±0.65 V of input, the output voltage is not a true replica or amplified version of the input, and we can see that as a [...] "kink" [...] in the output waveform near 0 V (or where one transistor stops conducting and the other starts).

One disadvantage is that the <b>output</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>swing</b> (typically ±10-20 V) was imposed upon a high DC voltage (200 V or so), requiring care in signal coupling, usually some form of wide-band DC coupling.

40|$|This {{tutorial}} discusses {{two related}} topics related to op amps: output phase reversal, and input over-voltage protection. <b>Output</b> <b>voltage</b> phase-reversal {{is a problem}} that occurs in some op amps when the input common-mode (CM) voltage is exceeded. It is usually caused when one of the internal stages of the op amp no longer has sufficient bias voltage across it and subsequently turns off.

Note that the inputs may still be well within the supply voltage rails, but simply above or below one of the specified CM limits.

40|$|Microwave or {{electromagnetic}} interference (EMI) can couple into electronic circuits and systems intentionally from high power microwave (HPM) sources or unintentionally {{due to the}} proximity to general electromagnetic (EM) environments, and cause "soft" reversible upsets and "hard" irreversible failures. As scaling-down of device feature size and bias voltage progresses, the circuits and systems become more susceptible to the interference. Thus, even low power interference can disrupt {{the operation of the}} circuits and systems. Furthermore, it is reported that even electronic systems under high level of shielding can be upset by intentional {{electromagnetic interference}} (IEMI), which has been drawing a great deal of concern from both the civil and military communities, but little has been done in terms of systematic study and investigation of these effects on IC circuits and devices. We have investigated the effects of high power microwave interference on three levels, (a) on fundamental single MOSFET devices, (b) on basic CMOS IC inverters and cascaded inverters, and (c) on a representative large IC timer circuit for automotive applications. We have studied and identified the most vulnerable static and dynamic parameters of operation related to device upsets. Fundamental upset mechanisms in MOSFETs and CMOS inverters and their relation to the characteristics of microwave interference (power, frequency, width, and period) and the device properties such as size, mobility, dopant concentration, and contact resistances, were investigated. Critical upsets in n-channel MOSFET devices resulting in loss of amplifier characteristics, were identified for the power levels above 10 dBm in the frequency range between 1 and 20 GHz. We have found that microwave interference induced excess charges are responsible for the upsets. Upsets in the static operation of CMOS inverters such as noise margins, <b>output</b> <b>voltages,</b> power dissipation, and bit-flip errors were identified using a load-line characteristic analysis.

40|$|Field-effect {{transistors}} (FETs) {{have been}} used as switches, particularly for analog signals, since the 1950 s. In the early days of analog sampling, it was discovered that such devices exhibit an input-dependent on-resist-ance, thereby introducing distortion. This issue can be resolved by “boot-strapping, ” a circuit technique that minimizes the switch on-resistance variation in the presence of large input and <b>output</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>swings.</b> In this article, we study the boot-strapped switch topology and appre-ciate its role in nanometer designs. Brief History To maintain a relatively constant on-resistance for a switch, we wish to fix its gate-source voltage as the input varies. In a patent filed in 1966 [1], Russell proposes the circuit shown in Figure 1, where the P-type source follower 15 shifts the input up by a relatively constant amount, | |,V 15 GS and drives the gate of the N-type switch, 10. Thus, | |V V V 10 15 GS in GS = + | |,V V 15 in GS- = and the switch acts as a linear resistance. We can view the source follower’s role as a bat-tery that sets. V 15 GS The idea of a “continuous-time” level shift between Vin and the gate of the switch became popular in the 1970 s and appeared in other patents [2], [3] in forms similar to Russell’s. But as analog CMOS circuits employed increasingly more switches, the power dissipated by the level shift cir-cuit, which cannot be shared among switches, proved undesirable. Also, the voltage headroom occupied by the source follower and its bias current source limited the allowable input range as the supplies scaled down. It was time to devise a more versatile “passive ” level shift arrangement that would consume no static power. The notion of realizing the level shift battery by a precharged capaci-tor can be traced to [4]. A number of modifications followed [5], [6], cul-minating in the topology described in [7] in 2001, which forms the foun-dation for our study here.

40|$|Many modern {{digital systems}} use forms of CMOS logical {{implementation}} {{due to the}} straight forward design nature of CMOS logic and minimal device area since CMOS uses fewer transistors than other logic families. To achieve high-performance requirements in mixed-signal chip development and quiet, noiseless circuitry, this thesis provides an alternative toCMOSin the form of MOS Current Mode Logic (MCML). MCML dissipates constant current and does not produce noise during value changing in a circuit CMOS circuits do. CMOS logical networks switch during clock ticks and with every device switching, noise is created on the supply and ground {{to deal with the}} transitions. Creating a noiseless standard cell library with MCML allows use of circuitry that uses low voltage switching with 1. 5 V between logic levels in a quiet or mixed-signal environment as opposed to the full rail to rail swinging of CMOS logic. This allows cohesive implementation with analog circuitry on the same chip due to constant current and lower switching ranges not creating rail noise during digital switching. Standard cells allow for the Cadence tools to automatically generate circuits and Cadence serves as the development platform for the MCML standard cells. The theory surrounding MCML is examined along with current and future applications well-suited for MCML are researched and explored with the goal of highlighting valid candidate circuits for MCML. Inverters and NAND gates with varying current drives are developed to meet these specialized goals and are simulated to prove viability for quiet, mixed-signal applications. Analysis and results show that MCML is a superior implementation choice compared toCMOSfor high speed and mixed signal applications due to frequency independent power dissipation and lack of generated noise during operation. Noise results show rail current deviations of 50 nA to 300 nA during switching over an average operating current of 20 µA to 80 µA respectively. The multiple order of magnitude difference between noise and signal allow the MCML cells to dissipate constant power and thus perform with no noise added to a system. Additional simulated results of a 31 -stage ring oscillator result in a frequency for MCML of 1. 57 GHz simulated versus the 150. 35 MHz that MOSIS tested on a fabricated 31 -stage CMOS oscillator.

Techniques to increase the <b>voltage</b> <b>swing</b> are discussed. Index Terms—Annealing, circuit noise, logic circuit fault tolerance, semiconductor device doping, semiconductor epitaxial layers, semiconductor junctions, tunnel diode, tunnel diode circuits.
