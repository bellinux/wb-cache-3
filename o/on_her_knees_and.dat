25|$|A {{monument}} {{dedicated to}} the troops of the 72nd Mizil Infantry Regiment, who fought during the Romanian Campaign of World War I (1916-1917), stands in the town. Built in 1921, the pedestal is 1.8 m high and the sculptures reach 2.7 m. They depict a woman in folk costume embodying the Fatherland, with her right hand raised in salute and her left holding the standard; a soldier and a woman sitting before her, the latter with an open book <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> representing History. There is a bronze plaque showing a battle scene, another featuring an inscription, and others naming the 1190 officers and enlisted men who died in battle.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} pair of jealous {{strippers}} applying lipstick and caddying back-and-forth between backstage, in a South of the Border strip zoo named [...] "La Jungla". Meanwhile, Mars' [...] "Money Make Her Smile" [...] can be heard from the room, the two of them are talking about a new girl who has been [...] "fooling around" [...] with someone else's man (Mr. Mars). The scene ends with one of the two women saying, [...] "Wait 'til I tell the boss what she's sleeping with". It is shown that the new girl, Isabella, has been listening to the conversation and it's her time to dance as soon as the boss says so. The role of Isabella is portrayed by Indian actress Freida Pinto, who after an introduction by Guzmán, the zoo owner, starts to pull off [...] "gravity-defying spins on the pole" [...] as Mars and his mates, who serve as the house band, perform the song. On the following scene, Isabella sheds her clothes with such rage that sparks fall from the ceiling while Mars stares at her intensely singing [...] "You and me baby making love like gorillas". As the second verse starts, intermittent shots of Mars and Isabella [...] "heating up the backseat of a car" [...] along with shots of her [...] "grinding on customers" [...] and banging on Mars' chest as he sings the line [...] "Bang Bang, Gorilla". The former shots are shown throughout the video. As the video continues, Isabella is shown [...] "to drop <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> lick" [...] Mars' guitar. She grabs it and pours tequila over the same, before using a lighter to set it on fire. Afterwards, the roof sprinklers come on and Isabella lets the water shower her while she stands on her underwear. The video ends in a chase scene in which Mars runs down through a dimly lit aisle, and suddenly transforms into a giant gorilla, while Isabella is seen {{at the end of the}} pathway waiting for him. The video doesn't contain any of the teasers Mars released days before the video, including the iguana shot, the outer car scene and the one with Luis Guzman listening to the intro for Isabella.|$|E

[...] Malin was ordered by the court to fall <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> pray to be able to confess, and after having obeyed, her daughter stated that she could no longer see the Devil.|$|E

She got <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> mourned Michael Jackson. Poignant! She hit most of her notes too, though sometimes slipping badly in her lower register. And she danced like only Beyonce can dance, {{with a combination of}} power, grace and smarts that fully unites Broadway choreography with urban street innovations... Indeed, her production {{can be seen as a}} retelling of pop's history from a feminine viewpoint -- and as an argument for Beyonce as the ultimate realization of the female pop dream." ...|$|E
2500|$|Black {{would not}} appear again until April at a ChickFight event where {{she made an}} {{emotional}} retirement announcement that was interrupted by Jetta who demanded Black explicitly acknowledge she was the reason Black was retiring but rather than ignore her, Black challenged her to what was dubbed a [...] "Career vs. Humiliation" [...] match at ChickFight XI where, should she lose, Black would have to admit it was Jetta that retired her but if she won Jetta would have to publicly go <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> admit Black's superiority. Jetta made her intentions known by squashing Faith LeHaine {{early on in the}} evening, wrenching her shoulder with a Japanese stranglehold and spent most of the match against Black working on her shoulder but Black retaliated, applying the Garden of Eden around the ring post and eventually locking it on Jetta {{in the middle of the}} ring forcing her to tap out. Following the match Black announced that she didn't need Jetta to go on her knees as she had just proven her superiority in the match. She later announced her retirement from wrestling.|$|E

2500|$|Owen's wife, Eliza, {{said that}} one of the men wore {{civilian}} clothes and the four others wore RIC caps and carried revolvers. John McMahon, one of Owen's sons, said [...] "Four of the five men were dressed in the uniform of the RIC but, from their appearance, I know they are Specials, not regular RIC". All of the men had hidden their faces. The four men in police uniform rushed up the stairs and herded the males into the dining room. The women were taken into another room. Eliza [...] "got down <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> pleaded for mercy, but was struck {{on the side of the}} head and fell to the floor". When Owen asked why his family was being singled-out, one of the gunmen said it was because he was [...] "a respected papist". The men were told, [...] "you boys say your prayers", before the gunmen opened fire. The shooting continued for five minutes; five of the men were killed outright and two were wounded, one fatally.|$|E
2500|$|The {{execution}} {{was performed}} in the square of Hötorget in Stockholm the 5 August 1676. Malin Matsdotter was to be executed alongside Anna [...] "Annika" [...] Simonsdotter Hack, known as [...] "Tysk-Annika", who had also been accused {{and sentenced to death}} on the testimony of her own children, but was to be executed the normal way by decapitation before burning. The contrast between the behavior of the two have been noted. Anna Simonsdotter was described as full humility and respect and behaved as was expected by her, and though she did not directly say that she was guilty, she behaved as was expected of her, and [...] "by her remorse, by her psalms, and by falling <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> lifting her head and her hands to the sky, confirmed the justice in the verdict and the justice in the world". According to contemporary witnesses, Malin Matsdotter behaved with great dignity and courage during her execution. When asked to take the hand of her daughter to make peace with her before death, she refused. She [...] "did not seem to fear death much, courageously mounting the stake", and even the official execution protocol noted that she [...] "was very tough".|$|E
