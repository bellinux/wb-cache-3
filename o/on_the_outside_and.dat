5|$|Beef steak can {{be cooked}} {{to a level}} of very rare (bleu, a cold raw center), rare, medium rare, medium, medium well done, or well done. Pittsburgh rare is charred on the outside. Beef, unlike certain other meats, {{does not need to be}} cooked through. Food-borne human {{illnesses}} are not normally found within a beef steak, though surfaces can potentially be contaminated from handling, and thus, very rare steak (seared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>and</b> raw within) is generally accepted as safe.|$|E
5|$|The {{defensive}} line (DL) consists of defensive ends (DE) and defensive tackles (DT). Defensive ends line {{up on the}} ends of the line, while defensive tackles line up inside, between the defensive ends. The primary responsibilities of defensive ends and defensive tackles is to stop running plays <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>and</b> inside, respectively, to pressure the quarterback on passing plays, and to occupy the line so that the linebackers can break through.|$|E
5|$|In the {{south-east}} {{corner of}} the walls is God's House tower. This is architecturally important as {{it was one of}} the first urban buildings to be built to hold gunpowder artillery – in this respect, it closely resembles Cow Tower in Norwich. The tower was built alongside God's House Gate and is three storeys high. The gunports designed for handcannon can be seen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside,</b> <b>and</b> the roof was designed to hold larger cannon. Adjacent to the tower is God's House Gate, a two-storey building also equipped with a gun-port.|$|E

5|$|The Inaccessible Island rail is a {{seasonal}} breeder, laying between October and January. They are monogamous, forming permanent pair-bonds. The nests are {{situated at the}} base of ferns with tussock grass, tussock grass clumps, or in tufts of sedges. The nests are domed and oval or pear shaped, with the entrances near the narrow end of the nest and linked by a track or tunnel that can go up to half a metre away. The nests are typically built entirely of the same material the nest is found in; for example, tussock grass or sedges. Where the construction material is tussock grass, larger leaves are used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>and</b> finer material lines the nest. There are a few reports of other material being used as lining, such as the leaves of introduced Malus domestica (apple) or Salix babylonica (willow).|$|E
5|$|The {{brains of}} {{vertebrates}} {{are made of}} very soft tissue. Living brain tissue is pinkish <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>and</b> mostly white on the inside, with subtle variations in color. Vertebrate brains are surrounded by a system of connective tissue membranes called meninges that separate the skull from the brain. Blood vessels enter {{the central nervous system}} through holes in the meningeal layers. The cells in the blood vessel walls are joined tightly to one another, forming the blood–brain barrier, which blocks the passage of many toxins and pathogens (though at the same time blocking antibodies and some drugs, thereby presenting special challenges in treatment of diseases of the brain).|$|E
5|$|The {{church has}} a single {{elongated}} nave. It is surmounted by a dome and finishes with a single apse in its eastern part. The dome is supported by arches {{to the north and}} south and vaults to the west and east. The apse is five-sided <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>and</b> round on the inside. To the west of it is the sanctuary which features three vaults which hosted the bema, the prothesis and the diaconicon. The sanctuary was separated {{from the rest of the}} nave via two pillars. Three buttresses support the south wall and the apse. The entrance to the church is on the south wall. The church has a total of 16 windows: three on the apse, one on the south wall, four on the north wall and one on the narthex.|$|E

Within the white strip, a stylized black tiger is seen holding a sable in its mouth. These two {{are surrounded by}} branches of cedar. The blue represents the waters of Lake Baikal, while white represents purity, goodness, and honesty. The green of the cedar branches represents hope, joy, and abundance.|$|R

5|$|The iLoo (short for Internet loo) was a {{cancelled}} Microsoft {{project to}} develop a Wi-Fi Internet-enabled portable toilet. The iLoo, which was to debut at British summer festivals, was described as being a portable toilet with wireless broadband Internet, an adjustable plasma screen, a membrane wireless keyboard, a six-channel speaker system, and toilet paper embossed with popular web site addresses. The iLoo was also to have an extra screen and keyboard <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside,</b> <b>and</b> was to be guarded. It was intended as the next {{in a series of}} successful initiatives by MSN UK which sought to introduce the internet in unusual locations, including MSN Street, MSN Park Bench and MSN Deckchair.|$|E
5|$|The {{innermost}} {{layer of}} bark {{is known as}} the phloem and this is involved in the transport of the sap containing the sugars made by photosynthesis {{to other parts of the}} tree. It is a soft spongy layer of living cells, some of which are arranged end to end to form tubes. These are supported by parenchyma cells which provide padding and include fibres for strengthening the tissue. Inside the phloem is a layer of undifferentiated cells one cell thick called the vascular cambium layer. The cells are continually dividing, creating phloem cells <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>and</b> wood cells known as xylem on the inside.|$|E
5|$|Early writers {{combined}} ctenophores with cnidarians into {{a single}} phylum called Coelenterata on account of morphological similarities between the two groups. Like cnidarians, the bodies of ctenophores consist of a mass of jelly, with one layer of cells <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>and</b> another lining the internal cavity. In ctenophores, however, these layers are two cells deep, while those in cnidarians are only a single cell deep. Ctenophores also resemble cnidarians in relying on water flow through the body cavity for both digestion and respiration, {{as well as in}} having a decentralized nerve net rather than a brain. However, genomic studies have suggested that the neurons of Ctenophora, which differ in many ways from other animal neurons, evolved independently from those of the other animals, and increasing awareness {{of the differences between the}} groups has persuaded more recent authors to classify the two as separate phyla. The position of the ctenophores in the evolutionary family tree of animals has long been debated, and the majority view at present, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that cnidarians and bilaterians are more closely related to each other than either is to ctenophores.|$|E

5|$|The arm-tefillin is laid on {{the inner}} side of the bare left arm, right arm if one is left handed, two finger breadths above the elbow, so that when the arm is bent the tefillin faces towards the heart. The arm-tefillin is {{tightened}} with the thumb, the blessing is said, and the strap is immediately wrapped around the upper arm in the opposite direction it came from {{in order to keep the}} knot tight without having to hold it. Some wrap it around the upper arm for less than a full revolution (the bare minimum to keep the knot tight) and then wrap it around the forearm seven times, while others wrap it around the upper arm an additional time before wrapping it around the forearm. Many Ashkenazim wear the knot to be tightened (not to be confused with the knot on the base which is permanently tied and always worn on the inside, facing the heart) on the inside and wrap inward, while Nusach Sephard Ashkenazim and all Sephardim wear it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>and</b> wrap outward.|$|E
25|$|The top of {{the rotunda}} wall {{features}} a series of brick relieving arches, visible <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>and</b> built into {{the mass of the}} brickwork. The Pantheon is full of such devices– for example, there are relieving arches over the recesses inside– but all these arches were hidden by marble facing on the interior and possibly by stone revetment or stucco on the exterior.|$|E
25|$|Zoology {{provides}} an example. Muskoxen, when threatened by wolves, form a circle with the males <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>and</b> the females and young on the inside. This {{is an example}} of a behavior by the males that seems to be altruistic. The behavior is disadvantageous to them individually but beneficial to the group as a whole and was thus seen by some to support the group selection theory.|$|E

25|$|The teeth have enamel <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>and</b> exposed dentin on the inside, so they self-sharpen during gnawing. On {{the other}} hand, {{continually}} growing molars {{are found in}} some rodent species, such as the sibling vole and the guinea pig. There is variation in the dentition of the rodents, but generally, rodents lack canines and premolars, and have a space between their incisors and molars, called the diastema region.|$|E
25|$|Decorations in Mamluk {{buildings}} {{concentrated on}} the most conspicuous areas of buildings: minarets, portals, windows, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside,</b> <b>and</b> mihrab, qiblah wall, and floor on the inside. Decorations at the time may be subdivided into structural decoration (found outside the buildings and incorporate the medium of construction itself such as ablaq walls, plain or zigzag moldings, fishscale motifs, joggled lintels or voussoirs, inscriptions, and muqarnas) and applied decoration (found inside the buildings and {{include the use of}} marble marquetry, stucco, and glass mosaic).|$|E
25|$|He {{returned}} to civvy street in 1946 with a profound depression {{and a belief}} that a head wound he had sustained had disfigured him on the inside as well as (temporarily) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside,</b> <b>and</b> would cause him to turn evil like Dr Jekyll becoming Mr Hyde. He received treatment, was institutionalised for a time, and made a full recovery, but perhaps his sympathetic visual treatment of Grendel, the monster from Beowulf, owes something to this period of his life.|$|E

25|$|In 1914 Williams {{sold the}} {{building}} and its accompanying land to the trustees of the church for $4,250 ($ in contemporary dollars). The church modernized the building, adding the transepts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>and</b> heating and electric lighting inside. In 1915 the Brotherhood held its last retreat there. At some point past 1919, the year {{a photograph of the}} church shows the original board-and-batten siding in place, the current shingled siding was added, most likely with the older siding as furring.|$|E
25|$|For example: oil/fat is {{insoluble}} in water, {{but when}} a couple of drops of dish soap {{are added to the}} mixture, the oil/fat dissolves in the water. The insoluble oil/fat molecules become associated inside micelles, tiny spheres formed from soap molecules with polar hydrophilic (water-attracting) groups <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>and</b> encasing a lipophilic (fat-attracting) pocket, which shields the oil/fat molecules from the water making it soluble. Anything that is soluble will be washed away with the water.|$|E
25|$|Pandan waffles {{originate}} from Vietnam and {{are characterized by}} the use of pandan flavoring and coconut milk in the batter. The pandan flavoring results in the batter's distinctive spring green color. When cooked, the waffle browns and crisps <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>and</b> stays green and chewy on the inside. Unlike most waffles, pandan waffles are typically eaten plain. In Vietnam they are relatively cheap and so are popular among children. They are a popular street food made in either cast iron molds heated with charcoal or in electric waffle irons.|$|E
