5|$|Armillaria species form fleshy, white-spored {{mushrooms}} with a cottony or membranous veil {{that typically}} forms a distinct annulus on the stem. The fruit bodies usually occur in autumn in large clusters {{at the base}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> or roots. Armillaria species can produce rhizomorphs—rootlike aggregations of hyphae—that can form massive, long-lasting underground networks. The growth of the rhizomorph networks allows for tree-to-tree spread of the fungus even when direct contact between diseased and healthy plants is not possible.|$|E

5|$|H.olivaceoalbus shows {{similarities}} between other closely related fungi {{of the genus}} Hygrophorus, {{some of which have}} only minor differences in physical features. Examples include H.pustulatus, H.inocybiformis, H.tephroleucus or H.morrisii. In the field, H.olivaceoalbus is distinguished by a combination of features including the double velum, the dark streaks on the slimy cap, the ing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stem,</b> and growth under pines, as well as by microscopic characteristics. There is no risk of confusing it with toxic fungi.|$|E

The phylogenetic analysis of Wu and colleagues (2000) suggests that the two taxa may be the same, although more samples from different geographical areas will be needed to verify this.|$|E
5|$|In {{a note on}} torsion, Thompson {{mentions}} Charles Darwin's {{treatment of}} climbing plants which often spiral around a support, noting that Darwin also observed that the spiralling stems were themselves twisted. Thompson disagrees with Darwin's teleological explanation, that the twisting makes the stems stiffer {{in the same way}} as the twisting of a rope; Thompson's view is that the mechanical adhesion of the climbing stem to the support sets up a system of forces which act as a 'couple' offset from the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stem,</b> making it twist.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{the caps}} {{are covered by}} a peridium—an outer {{covering}} layer of tissue. After the fruit body matures and begins to dry out, {{the lower part of}} the peridium starts to rip, usually starting from small longitudinal slits near where the peridium attaches to the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stem.</b> However, the pattern of tearing is variable; in some instances, the slits may appear higher up on the peridium, in others, the peridium rips more irregularly. The peridium may also rip in such a way that it appears as if there is a ring at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stem.</b> The torn peridium exposes the internal gleba. The gleba is divided into wavy plates or lamellae, some of which are fused together to form irregular chambers. The gleba is a drab brown to blackish-brown color, and it becomes tough and brittle as it dries out. The flesh is firm when young, white, and will stain light to bright yellow when it is bruised.|$|E

The specific name sasicola refers to the fact the species grows upon the leaves of Sasa species. The Japanese common name for the species is Sasa-no-houraitake. Within the genus Mycena, it probably belongs to the section Marasmius, and the subsection Penicillati, due to characters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stem,</b> gills and pileipellis (the outer-most layer of the cap).|$|E

5|$|Species that {{resemble}} A.deserticola include the desert fungi Montagnea arenaria and Podaxis pistillaris. Montagnea arenaria is a whitish stalked puffball with a hollow, woody stalk and a loose sac-like volva {{at the base}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stem.</b> It is topped by a thin disc-like cap with blackish gill plates suspended around the margin. Podaxis pistillaris has a cylindrical to oval white to brownish cap with a paper-thin wall atop a slender stem. When mature, the cap contains powdery, dark brown spores.|$|E

5|$|Xeromphalina setulipes {{shows some}} {{similarities}} to X.cauticinalis. They share the amber-coloured hair towards the base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> and both grow on soil, {{as opposed to}} directly onto wood. Further, X.cauticinalis can display caulocystidia of the same distinctive shape as those of X.setulipes (though these are mixed with the other shapes more typical of the genus). X.cauticinalis mushrooms are typically of a different colour; for instance, the area at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> is paler than the rest, compared to the entirely dark stem of X.setulipes. Furthermore, X.cauticinalis has a very bitter taste. X.setulipes shares with X.brunneola its dark colouration and some microscopic traits. However, the two clearly differ {{in the shape of}} both the cheilocystidia and the pileocystidia, the width of the spores (the spores of X.brunneola measure between 2 and 3μm in width) and the fact it is found specifically in softwood woodland. Furthermore, the two {{do not appear to be}} closely related.|$|E

5|$|Areoles {{are highly}} {{specialized}} and very condensed shoots or branches. In a normal shoot, nodes bearing leaves or flowers would be separated by lengths of stem (internodes). In an areole, the nodes {{are so close}} together, they form a single structure. The areole may be circular, elongated into an oval shape, or even separated into two parts; the two parts may be visibly connected in some way (e.g. by a groove in the stem) or appear entirely separate (a dimorphic areole). The part nearer the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> then produces flowers, the other part spines. Areoles often have multicellular hairs (trichomes) that give the areole a hairy or woolly appearance, sometimes of a distinct color such as yellow or brown.|$|E
5|$|Boletus auripes {{somewhat}} resembles B.aurantiosplendens, but {{the latter}} species {{has a more}} variably colored cap that can be orange, brownish orange, or yellowish, and variable degrees of stem reticulation. B.hortonii has a similar color scheme but lacks reticulation on the stem. B.auripes bears a superficial resemblance in coloration to the Costa Rican species B.lychnipes, known only from a limited area in the northern Cordillera de Talamanca. The latter species may be distinguished {{by the lack of}} reticulations on the upper half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stem,</b> a brown or salmon-pink staining reaction on the stem in response to handling, and microscopically by a conspicuously sterile margin and prominent pseudocystidia. Retiboletus retipes is set apart from B.auripes by a darker cap, tubes that lack an olive tinge, and a stem that has more prominent reticulation extending down to the base. In contrast to B.auripes, B.impolitus has a floccose (wooly) or tomentose cap surface, and lacks an olive tinge on the tubes.|$|E
5|$|Fruit body {{primordia}} first appear {{between the}} scales of the cones, and require 9 to 35 days to reach their final height. They consist of an inner core of thin-walled generative hyphae enclosed by an outer coat of skeletal hyphae. Immature fruit bodies are white and delicate, but gradually become brown as they mature. Because the cap is grown from the stem tip after it bends, cap development interrupts stem growth, and this shift to centrifugal growth (that is, growth outward from the stem) results in the typical kidney-shaped or semicircular cap. Although the fruit body takes at least 9 days to mature, spores production begins within 48–72 hours of the start of cap growth. Spines start out as minute protuberances on the part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> adjoining the undersurface of the cap. As the cap enlarges, these spines are spread horizontally, and more protuberances are formed, which elongate vertically downwards.|$|E

5|$|In 1914, Zeller {{published}} {{a study of}} the development of the mushroom, made possible by the prolific fruiting of the fungus in Seattle in the fall of 1912. Development was studied by examining thin sections of tissues in different stages of development, and the differentiation of tissues and structures followed by using histological stains. The growth form of Xerocomellus zelleri is called gymnocarpic, meaning that the hymenium appears and develops to maturity in an exposed state, not enclosed by any protective membrane. In this type of development, the cap is formed from hyphae at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> and subsequently expands by growth along the margins; the hymenium forms later beneath the cap in a direction away from the center.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe cookei, {{commonly}} known as the straw fibrecap, is a species of mushroom in the Inocybaceae family. It was first described in 1892 by Giacomo Bresadola, and is named in honour of Mordecai Cubitt Cooke. The species can be found in Europe, Asia and North America. It produces small mushrooms of an ochre colour, with a prominent umbo, fibres on the cap and a distinctive bulb at the base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stem.</b> It grows from soil in mixed woodland, and is encountered in summer and autumn, though is not common. Ecologically, it feeds through use of ectomycorrhiza. Inocybe cookei has been described as both toxic and non-toxic, but either way, is not advised for consumption.|$|E
