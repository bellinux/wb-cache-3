5|$|Majin Tensei was {{released}} on January 28, 1994 for the Super Famicom, and later for Microsoft Windows. The Super Famicom version was re-released through the Nintendo Power flash memory service on December 1, 1997, and digitally through the Virtual Console service for Wii and Wii U on September 6, 2011 and July 15, 2015.

5|$|Morris had {{continued}} to devote much time to writing poetry. In 1867 Bell and Dandy published Morris's epic poem, The Life and Death of Jason, at his own expense. The book was a retelling of the ancient Greek myth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hero</b> Jason and his quest to find the Golden Fleece. In contrast to Morris's former publication, The Life and Death of Jason was well received, resulting in the publishers paying Morris a fee for the second edition.|$|E
5|$|The Popol Vuh {{was written}} in the Latin script in early colonial times, and was {{probably}} transcribed from a hieroglyphic book by an unknown K'iche' Maya nobleman. It {{is one of the most}} outstanding works of indigenous literature in the Americas. The Popul Vuh recounts the mythical creation of the world, the legend <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hero</b> Twins, and the history of the Postclassic K'iche' kingdom. Deities recorded in the Popul Vuh include Hun Hunahpu, the K'iche' maize god, and a triad of deities led by the K'iche' patron Tohil, and also including the moon goddess Awilix, and the mountain god Jacawitz.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode is}} {{read in a}} radically {{different}} way by Walter Goffart. According to him, the whole story assumes an allegorical meaning, with Paul intent on telling an edifying story of the downfall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hero</b> and his expulsion from the promised land, because of his human weakness. In this story, the skull cup {{plays a key role}} as it unites original sin and barbarism. Goffart does not exclude the possibility that Paul had really seen the skull, but believes that by the 740s the connection between sin and barbarism as exemplified by the skull cup had already been established.|$|E

5|$|Vargas Llosa rose to fame in the 1960s with novels such as The Time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hero</b> (La ciudad y los perros, {{literally}} The City and the Dogs, 1963/1966), The Green House (La casa verde, 1965/1968), and {{the monumental}} Conversation in the Cathedral (Conversación en la catedral, 1969/1975). He writes prolifically across {{an array of}} literary genres, including literary criticism and journalism. His novels include comedies, murder mysteries, historical novels, and political thrillers. Several, such as Captain Pantoja and the Special Service (1973/1978) and Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter (1977/1982), have been adapted as feature films.|$|E
5|$|Warhawk was {{initially}} intended {{to have both}} single-player and multiplayer modes, however the single-player element was canceled during development due to concerns that it was inferior to the game's multiplayer component. The game was released with five maps (each with five possible configurations) and four game types, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Zones and Capture the Flag. After the 1.4 update, the number of game types increased to six with the addition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hero</b> and Collection modes. Three optional expansion packs for the game containing new maps and equipment {{increase the number of}} available maps to eight.|$|E
5|$|A Hero's Song is musically {{structured}} like a four-movement symphony, {{beginning with}} an allegro con fuoco, transitioning {{to a slow}} poco adagio lacrimosa, then including a scherzo and concluding with a coda. The piece {{is based on a}} short, energetic theme in B minor played in the violas, cellos, and basses {{at the start of the}} piece. This theme is featured in various forms throughout the first section. Following this, a slow section is marked by quiet music which symbolizes the hero's grief. It includes a funeral march, a musical form Dvořák also used in his Requiem, Stabat Mater, and Piano Quintet No. 2. The hero recovers from his grief as the mood of the music gradually brightens and goes into B major, leading into the dance-like scherzo. Finally, the triumph <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hero</b> is represented by the victorious coda. The piece has a run time of approximately 22 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Literary scholar M. Keith Booker {{argues that}} Vargas Llosa perfects the {{technique}} of interlacing dialogues in his novel The Green House. By combining two conversations that occur at different times, he creates {{the illusion of a}} flashback. Vargas Llosa also sometimes uses this technique as a means of shifting location by weaving together two concurrent conversations happening in different places. This technique is a staple of his repertoire, which he began using {{near the end of his}} first novel, The Time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hero.</b> However, he does not use interlacing dialogues in the same way in all of his novels. For example, in The Green House the technique is used in a serious fashion to achieve a sober tone and to focus on the interrelatedness of important events separated in time or space. In contrast, Captain Pantoja and the Special Service employs this strategy for comic effects and uses simpler spatial shifts. This device is similar to both Virginia Woolf's mixing of different characters' soliloquies and Gustave Flaubert's counterpoint technique in which he blends together conversation with other events, such as speeches.|$|E
5|$|The Nobel Prize ensured Andrić {{received}} global recognition. The following March, he {{fell ill}} {{while on a}} trip to Cairo and had to return to Belgrade for an operation. He was obliged to cancel all promotional events in Europe and North America, but his works continued to be reprinted and translated into numerous languages. Judging by letters he wrote at the time, Andrić felt burdened by the attention but did his best not to show it publicly. Upon receiving the Nobel Prize, the number of awards and honours bestowed upon him multiplied. He received the Order of the Republic in 1962, as well as the 27 July Award of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the AVNOJ Award in 1967, and the Order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hero</b> of Socialist Labour in 1972. In addition to {{being a member of the}} Yugoslav and Serbian academies of sciences and arts, he also became a correspondent of their Bosnian and Slovenian counterparts, and received honorary doctorates from the universities of Belgrade, Sarajevo and Kraków.|$|E
5|$|The Temple of Awilix is on {{the east}} side of the plaza. Awilix was the patron goddess of the Nijaib lineage and is {{identified}} with Ixbalanque, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hero</b> Twins from the Popul Vuh. According to a drawing made by Rivera y Maestre, the temple of Awilix was not as tall as the temple of Tohil. This structure was apparently the second most important temple in Q'umarkaj. Originally this temple was formed of a large rectangular platform supporting a smaller platform and a temple structure {{on the east side}}. A wide stairway climbed the west side of the temple, it was flanked on the lower level by two large talud-tablero panels. The exterior stonework of the building has been completely stripped away. The temple is similar in form to a temple mound on the west side of the first plaza in Iximche, the postclassic capital of the Kaqchikel Maya. There were four principal phases of construction and there is evidence that the temple had been repaired various times prior to the Conquest. The floor under the third phase of construction had been painted dark green. Archaeological investigations found fragments of incense burners underneath the first building phase.|$|E

5|$|The single reel drama, {{approximate}} 650 feet long, {{was released}} on June 17, 1910. Some trade publications list {{the length of the}} film as 1000 feet though. The United Kingdom release of the film may have had the name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hero</b> changed to Peter. A synopsis in The Bioscope on October 27, 1910 refers to the hero by the name Peter. This alternative name for the hero of the story {{can be found in the}} 1910 publication of Reader 1st-4th by D. Appleton and Company. A review in The Moving Picture World was neutral because it lacked specific praise or criticism of the production. The film had a wide release, advertisements for the showing in theaters include those in Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Indiana, and Missouri. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|In March, 1944, the {{division}} {{was transferred to}} the 71st Rifle Corps, where it would remain {{for the duration of the}} conflict. At about the same time, the 31st Army became part of the 3rd Belorussian Front. In the initial stages of Operation Bagration, the front's immediate objective was the city of Orsha. The 331st had the direct support of the 959th SU Regiment (SU-76s) for its initial assault; this regiment had been assigned to support of the corps since the beginning of June. In recognition of the 331st's role in the liberation of Orsha, on June 27, it was awarded the Order of Suvorov, 2nd Class. The division went on to assist in the liberation of Borisov. While two divisions of the 8th Guards Rifle Corps of the 11th Guards Army attacked from the west and north, the 331st drove into the south of the city and it was cleared of German forces by 3:00 am on July 1. In the following days it took part in the liberation of Minsk, before joining the general advance to the 1941 Soviet-German frontier. In recognition of his successful command of {{the division}} in this operation, Major General Berestov was awarded the Gold Star <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hero</b> of the Soviet Union on June 27, 1945.|$|E
