40|$|This article {{explores the}} “gender model” of job {{research}} instruments {{that are based}} on the Holland Occupational Classification scheme. The six Holland “environments” constitute a ubiquitous base for tests and measures in career counseling and research. Analysis of the 1973 Quality of Employment Survey provides evidence that the Holland Classification scheme replicates the segmentation of women into certain occupations that generate low pay, even after controlling for worker education, job tenure, and age. Comparable data for male wage earners show a significant segregation away from low-income, predominantly female occupations. Thus the Holland <b>occupational</b> <b>scheme</b> and the instruments based upon it are likely to contribute to the replication of sex-segregated labor markets. The findings suggest that current models of “work” and job counseling tests and techniques may reinforce, rather than eliminate, the economic disadvantages for women...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe European Union {{appears to}} be {{promoting}} {{at the same time}} both cross-national mobility of workers and an increased role for occupational pensions. There is, however, a potential tension between these two objectives because workers risk losing (some of) their pension rights under an <b>occupational</b> <b>scheme</b> as a consequence of their mobility. After long negotiations, the EU has addressed this issue through a minimum standards Directive. Shortly before the adoption of this Directive, the Court of Justice also delivered an important decision in the same field, in the case of Casteels v British Airways. By analysing the resulting legal framework for safeguarding pension rights under occupational schemes in the context of workers’ mobility, we argue that the application of the case law developed by the Court of Justice in the field of free movement of workers has the potential to offer superior protection compared to the Directive. We also highlight the fact that the present legal framework seems to afford a much fuller protection to the intracompany cross-national mobility of workers employed by multinational companies, while also seemingly favouring mobility for highly specialised workers...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{an often}} neglected question in labour market research: to which extent do outcomes aggregated {{on the national}} level disguise occupational diversity in employment conditions? In particular, how and why do occupational groups differ with regard to the incidence of non-standard employment? To explore these questions, the paper derives a detailed <b>occupational</b> <b>scheme</b> from the literature, capturing the variety of labour market outcomes within countries. In a second step, the scheme is theoretically linked to the topic of non-standard work. It is argued that different degrees of skill specificity across occupational groups produce diverging incentives for flexible and long-term employment, respectively. This leads to the expectation of (some) service-sector occupations showing stronger tendencies towards non-standard employment than those in the industrial sector. Based on European and German micro data, the categorisation is used to decompose various labour market indicators. The results clearly demonstrate the unequal incidence of non-standard employment {{along the lines of the}} suggested categorisation. Moreover, the longitudinal perspective suggests that traditionally functioning occupational groups will be crowded out by more destandardised ones. temporary employment, low-pay, labour market dualisation, occupational groups, post-industrial labour markets, Germany...|$|E

40|$|The {{pensions}} industry's {{argument that}} the favourable tax treatment of occupational pension funds amounts to tax deferment rather than tax exemption is evaluated using a net present value approach to estimate {{the cost of the}} tax foregone in taxing employee pension contributions on a consumption tax basis rather than an income tax basis. It is shown that the net present value estimate and the Revenue Commissioners cash flow estimate are in close agreement if tax rates for workers and pensioners are the same and that the Revenue Commissioners estimate is conservative if tax rates for pensioners are lower than for workers. A comparison is made of the trend in the cost of tax expenditure on occupational pensions since 1980 relative to the trend in the cost of direct expenditure on social welfare pensions and it is shown that the cost of tax expenditure has grown from around 10 per cent in 1980 to 66 per cent in 1997 and that the Exchequer support for the average participant in an <b>occupational</b> <b>scheme</b> has risen from one quarter to more than one-and-a-half times Exchequer expenditure for the average participant in the social insurance scheme. The assumption, therefore, that pensions can be provided at less cost to the Exchequer through private financial institutions is questionable given existing pension tax arrangements. The distribution of the tax incentives provided for members of occupational pension schemes is evaluated and it is shown that most of the benefits accrue to those {{at the top of the}} income distribution. ...|$|E
40|$|The German {{pension reform}} of 2001 was a {{milestone}} {{on the road}} towards pension individualisation. It enhanced the funded occupational (and private) pension system (Riester-pensions), and therefore shifted investment risks to employers and individuals. The new <b>occupational</b> <b>scheme</b> allows for different types of pension vehicles that are either defined benefit (DB) or defined contribution (DC) plans. Since all such schemes are embedded in multiple layers of institutional insurance mechanisms, including strict investment principles, even the riskier DC schemes have limited exposure to financial market volatility. This article explores the extent of risk individualisation in Riester-occupational pensions by describing risk distribution between the employee and the employer. It starts with discussing the relevant legislation since the nineteenth century until the reform of 2001. The reform defined two main risk-related decisions which are analysed here. The first, {{the selection of the}} pension vehicle, determines the scope of the risk. The second is the choice between DB and German DC that defines the distribution of risk between the employer and the employee. Finally, the paper investigates these choices empirically by using a unique, proprietary data-set of a German pension provider with approximately 271, 000 pension scheme enrolees joining in the years between 2002 and 2008. The findings highlight the employer’s pivotal role in determining the options available to the employee. For this reason, employee’s choice is limited and could partly be explained by socio-economic variables traditionally associated with risk aversion. Furthermore, despite the low level of risk embedded in Riester-type occupational pensions, individuals prefer the low risk alternatives. The study also identifies a conscious, risk prone group of employees who joined the savings plan right after the reform, in 2002 and 2003. Enrolees of the latter years are more likely to prefer insurance over uncertain returns, and reject the idea of risk individualisation...|$|E
40|$|Sir (later Lord) W. Beveridge {{argued in}} his famous Report of 1942 that any social {{security}} benefits paied as of right without test of means should be adequate for minimum subsistence without other means 'The subsistence principle' was generally regarded as the central idea of the Beveridge Plan, and so this means providing, as {{an essential part of}} the plan, a pension on retirement from work which is enough for subsistence, even though the pensioner has no other re- sources whatever. But in practice the rates of benefit and pension since the operation of the National Insurance Scheme have not yet reached subsistence level as Beveridge defined it. Year after year rising prices have eaten away the real value of the pension, then nearly a million and more retirement pensioners and their wives are forced to rely on supplementation from the National Assistance Board Why is it? One reason is the increase in prices; another-even more important-is the structure of National Insurance itself. The national contributory pension has always been a flat-rate payment in return for a flat-rate contribution. But the limitations of this system set an important social problem. The contributions must necessarily be fixed at a level which the lower-paid can afford and therefore are not even sufficient to pay for the present level of pensions. Even apart from this the pension scale possible under a flatrate scheme is necessarily restricted. This restriction dose not matter much to the higher-paid worker if he is also getting further pension rights in an <b>occupational</b> <b>scheme.</b> But despite their encouraging growth, occupational schemes do not yet cover much more than one-third of the total working population including half the men and seem unlikely to cover nearly everybody, at any rate for some time to come. The alternative is some graduation of contributions and pensions according to earnings. It has long been known that the Labour Party was preparing a proposal for a new National Superannuation Plan for persons reaching retiring age. This plan of the Labour Party has been maked public in May 1957. The Labour proposes that there shall be a national pension consisting of two parts - a flat-rate part and a part graded as a percentage of earnings. According to the plan, the basic pension payable at 65 to all insured workers would be increased immediately from ￡ 2 to ￡ 3. It would be supplemented by a super-annuation system related to earnings, which would be compulsory for everyone not participating in an approved private scheme or possessing adequate provision for old age. The aim of the plan is to ensure that, in return for extra contributions, a pension equivalent to 'half-pay' at 65 for the average wage-earner is reached. The employee would contribute 3 per cent of his earnings, the employer 5 per cent and the Exchequer 2 per cent of the total earnings of the community. Self-employed persons would contribute 8 per cent. The maximum benefit would be ￡ 750 a year. Payment of pensions might not be, as at present, conditional on retirement. The Labour's national superannuation benefit would be based on life earnings, taking account of their real value from the beginning of the worker's career and of the increase in the national income which had occurred since that time. Contributions in each year of working life would be related to the level of average of national earnings in the year when the pension was assessed. Opposing the Labour's plan, programm Government's programme to put the National Insurance Scheme on a sound financial footing and at the same time to introduce into it a measure of graduated contributions and retirement pensions related to earnings is announced in a White Paper on 14 Oct. 1958. The main features of Government's proposals are. (1) The basic flat-rate pensions would stay as they are now for all contributors, although those earning ￡ 9 a week or less would pay a smaller con- tribution. (2) On earnings between ￡ 9 and ￡ 15 a week workers (and employers) would pay graduated contributions of 8. 5 per cent of earnings, as P. A. Y E. deductions, in return for a wage-related supplementary pension (8) The Exchequer would support the new scheme by a yearly payment of ￡ 170 m. (4) To meet the rapidly rising cost of retirement pensions, contributions would have to be increased at five-yearly intervals during the first twenty years and would not add to graduated pensions. Thus, both the Government's scheme and the Labour's plan take bold step away from the universal flat-rate system, departing from the Beveridge principle of treating all men equally in social insurance irrespective of their rates of wages or other earnings. Both of them envisage adding a new graded superannuation pension to the existing National Insurance pension, while permitting approved private schemes to contract out' on certain conditions. But, on careful comparison, the grading in the Government scheme is a financial device for getting-more money to support the scheme. It looks as if one aspect of it is the purpose of keeping the Exchequer contribution down to a steady ￡ 170 m. In other words, it is a financial scheme even more than a pension scheme. On the contrary, the Labour proposed scheme, though it may be much more costly than envisaged and may be inflationary, leads to a very substantial redistribution of income from the higher-paied skilled worker to the unskilled worker and from the young to the old...|$|E
