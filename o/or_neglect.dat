5|$|The {{church does}} not require that Christian Scientists avoid all medical care—adherents use dentists, optometrists, obstetricians, {{physicians}} for broken bones, and vaccination when required by law—but maintains that Christian-Science prayer is most effective when not combined with medicine. Between the 1880s and 1990s the avoidance of medical treatment led {{to the deaths of}} several adherents and their children. Parents and others were prosecuted for, and in a few cases convicted of, manslaughter <b>or</b> <b>neglect.</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is focused}} on some problems of maltreated, abused <b>or</b> <b>neglected</b> children and it also tries to outline a contemporary view of this situation. Considerable changes occured in this field after breaking a taboo on this subject, which {{is presented as a}} topic for a wide discussion. In my work I tried to give a complex view of some aspects of maltreated, abused <b>or</b> <b>neglected</b> children problems. Furthemore I focused on the problems of a public awareness concerning maltreated, abused <b>or</b> <b>neglected</b> children, and possible public activities in this field. I also investigated a public awareness of civic associations (i. e. organisations, institutions or facilities) which take care of endangered children in Trhové Sviny and nearby sorroundings. This research was based on a standardised questionaire. According to an analysis of its results, it is possible to to state a negation of both hypotheses in which I originally considered a public awareness of maltreated, abused <b>or</b> <b>neglected</b> children low, <b>or</b> likewise, I pressumed that a public awareness of the above mentioned organisations (civic associations, institutions) would not be very high. In spite of these conclusions it is a safe assumption that the tasks given to find out a situation in a public awareness concerning the endangered children, were fulfilled...|$|R
