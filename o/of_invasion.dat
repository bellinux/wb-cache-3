5|$|As {{the threat}} <b>of</b> <b>invasion</b> was clearly felt in late 1941, {{an idea for}} a series of secret {{observation}} posts (first in Gibraltar and later in other places like Malta and Aden) was put together under Operation Tracer.|$|E
5|$|Japan's {{rapid advance}} south had been unexpected, and the {{perceived}} threat <b>of</b> <b>invasion</b> led to a major expansion of the Australian military. By mid-1942 the Army had a strength of ten infantry divisions, three armoured divisions {{and hundreds of other}} units. Thousands of Australians who were ineligible for service in the military responded to the threat of attack by joining auxiliary organisations such as the Volunteer Defence Corps and Volunteer Air Observers Corps, which were modelled on the British Home Guard and Royal Observer Corps respectively. However, Australia's population and industrial base were not sufficient to maintain these forces once the threat <b>of</b> <b>invasion</b> had passed, and the Army was progressively reduced in size from 1943.|$|E

5|$|After the {{operation}} closed, {{at the end}} of June 1944, the threat <b>of</b> <b>invasion</b> from the United States was informally kept alive. It was revisited as Ironside II in mid-July as support for Operation Ferdinand. The invasion story was replaced with a supposed Allied plan to increase French resistance in the Bordeaux region to tie up German forces. Most of Ironside II was ignored by the Germans, whose interest had turned away from the region.|$|E

5|$|Hitler {{wanted to}} {{maintain}} the threat <b>of</b> <b>invasion</b> by continuing air attacks on military targets in the British capital.

5|$|In 1539 {{the threat}} <b>of</b> <b>invasion</b> from France and Spain grew and Henry issued orders for his coastal defences to be improved, {{creating}} {{a sequence of}} fortifications called the Device Forts across England.

In 1588, however, there was a renewed threat <b>of</b> <b>invasion,</b> this time from Spain; the Spanish Armada sailed from A Coruña, while a separate invasion force was prepared in Flanders, threatening London; Rober Dudley, the Earl of Leicester was put in charge of the defences along the Thames.|$|E
