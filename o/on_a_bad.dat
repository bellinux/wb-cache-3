He then scored 127 against Northamptonshire, 208 against Essex, 123 and 25 not out against Surrey and 74 against the Marylebone Cricket Club in four consecutive matches. Australia {{won the first}} two by an innings and the latter two by seven and five wickets respectively. Up to this point, Macartney had only claimed a solitary wicket. He then took match figures of 6/60 in a ten-wicket win over Oxford University.|$|E
5|$|The {{father was}} {{eventually}} fired by his Russian supervisors for pro-Polish sentiments, {{and forced to}} take lower-paying posts; the family also lost money <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> investment, and eventually chose to supplement their income by lodging boys in the house. Maria's mother Bronisława operated a prestigious Warsaw boarding school for girls; she resigned from the position after Maria was born. She died of tuberculosis in May 1878, when Maria was ten years old. Less than three years earlier, Maria's oldest sibling, Zofia, had died of typhus contracted from a boarder. Maria's father was an atheist; her mother a devout Catholic. The deaths of Maria's mother and sister caused her to give up Catholicism and become agnostic.|$|E

5|$|In the ODI tri-nation tournament against Australia and Zimbabwe that followed, Pathan was {{the leading}} wicket-taker with 16 wickets {{at an average of}} 31 in his maiden ODI series. After ending with 0/61 from ten overs on debut against Australia, he bounced back to take 3/64 and 3/51 in the next two matches against the World Cup holders. He earned his first {{international}} man of the match award in the tournament, after taking 4/24 against Zimbabwe at the WACA Ground in Perth in his eighth ODI. However, his tour ended <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> note after he was reprimanded by match referees for mocking the Australian batsman Damien Martyn after his dismissal in the second final. In that match, he took 2/75 as Australia amassed 5/359 and crushed India by 208 runs. Pathan made 30 in the match as his team folded for only 151. His batting improved {{towards the end of the}} tour with three scores of at least 19 in his last four innings, and he ended with 86 runs at 17.20 for the tournament.|$|E

25|$|Her {{grandson}} Vijaya Ranga Chokkanatha Nayak, starting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> note, {{enjoyed a}} long but apparently dull reign of 26 years, paving {{way for the}} demise of the dynasty. He was vain and weak-minded, and unfit to govern either himself or others. His reign was distinguished by the ill-regulated and extraordinary munificence of his gifts to Brahmins and religious institutions. The injustice of his rule caused a serious riot in Madurai, the mutiny of his troops, and incessant disturbances.|$|E
25|$|He was {{the leading}} all-rounder for Derbyshire between the wars and at his peak {{probably}} the most deadly bowler on a sticky wicket Derbyshire ever produced, owing to his perfect length and ability to turn the ball back from the off. His pace was almost medium {{and even the most}} fleet-footed of batsmen could not hit him easily <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> pitch; however, his lack of flight and variety made him less effective on good pitches. Townsend was also an enterprising middle order batsman, who set a longstanding record for most centuries for Derbyshire in a season in 1933.|$|E

25|$|Using credits, {{a player}} can buy wares from stations. These wares may be used, or flown to another station {{where they can}} be sold, ideally for a profit.

25|$|In {{his youth}} {{primarily}} a football goalkeeper {{who played for}} some time with Queen's Park Rangers, Nichols' prowess at cricket during the summer {{brought him to the}} attention of the Essex committee during the early 1920s, who recommended him as a left-handed batsman. He was engaged for 1924 but did not gain a regular place in the first eleven that year. The following year, however, Nichols gained a regular place as a promising fast bowler and batted very low in the order. He did nothing sensational apart from playing the primary role in dismissing Kent for 43 <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> wicket at Southend in late July.|$|E
25|$|New Orleans scored first after Vikings quarterback Tommy Kramer's fumble <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> snap led to Saints quarterback Bobby Hebert's 10-yard {{touchdown}} pass to wide receiver Eric Martin. Then, Kramer was sacked and the Vikings had to punt, but Saints returner Mel Gray accidentally hit the ball while trying to avoid it and the Vikings recovered on the New Orleans 27, leading to Chuck Nelson's 42-yard field goal. Kramer {{had to leave the}} game on the next drive with a pinched nerve in his neck, but the team would go on to win easily without him. Later in the quarter, they went up 10-7 when Anthony Carter returned a Saints punt a playoff record 84 yards for a touchdown.|$|E

25|$|In Week 2, {{the team}} {{traveled}} to St. Louis where they lost 24-22. A major defensive loss was suffered when Brian Orakpo went {{down from a}} tear to his left pectoral muscle. Despite widespread complaints from Redskins fans and players about the Rams playing dirty, {{there was nothing to}} do but move on to the home opener against Cincinnati. The game started <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> omen when the Bengals threw a 76-yard TD pass on the opening drive. Although the Redskins responded furiously and played another close match, they lost and injuries continued to pile up as CB Josh Wilson and WR Pierre Garçon went down. They would win their next game on a late game field goal at Tampa Bay, 24-22, after the Buccaneers made a 4th quarter comeback to take the lead. The Redskins only won one of their next five games, going into the bye week at 3-6.|$|E
25|$|Poore {{returned}} to South Africa after the 1899 season {{to fight in}} the Boer War. After he {{returned to}} England, a broken arm caused him to miss most of the 1902 season, but he showed he retained his former skill with a superb innings of 62 not out against Hugh Trumble on a sticky wicket for Hampshire against the touring Australians. It was hoped Major Poore would be available again in 1903, but he went to India that summer and when he returned to Hampshire in the middle of 1904 to great expectations, his form was disappointing. Although there were few difficult pitches in the nine games he played, he averaged under twenty and only once (<b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> wicket against Sussex) did he show the skill that allowed him to dominate bowlers in 1899. In 1905 he again could not play at all, but he rejoined the team against Derbyshire in 1906 and in two matches scored 232 runs including 129 against Sussex, but another injury ended his season and as it turned out, his county career.|$|E

25|$|With {{the series}} {{returning}} to Yankee Stadium for Game 6, the comeback continued with Schilling pitching <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> ankle. The three sutures in Schilling's ankle bled throughout the game, making his sock appear bloody red. Schilling struck out four, walked none, and only allowed one run over seven innings {{to lead the}} team to victory. Mark Bellhorn also helped in the effort as he hit a three-run {{home run in the}} fourth inning. In the bottom of the ninth, the Yankees staged a rally and brought former Red Sox player Tony Clark to the plate as the potential winning run. Keith Foulke, pitching for the third day in a row, struck out Clark to end the game and force the deciding Game 7. In this game, the Red Sox completed their historic comeback owing to the strength of Derek Lowe's one-hit, one-run pitching and Johnny Damon's two home runs (including a grand slam in the second inning). The New York Yankees were defeated 10–3. Ortiz, who had the game-winning RBIs in Games 4 and 5, was named ALCS Most Valuable Player. The Red Sox joined the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs and 1975 New York Islanders as the only professional sports teams in history to win a best-of-seven games series after being down three games to none, as would the 2010 Philadelphia Flyers and 2014 Los Angeles Kings.|$|E
25|$|The {{fourth and}} final Test match was played between 3–7 November 2004 at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai. Having already lost the series, India made changes in the team. Patel, Akash Chopra, Ajit Agarkar and Yuvraj Singh were all dropped from the lineup. The first day of play was almost {{completely}} washed out by rain, with only 11 overs being bowled. India won the toss and elected to bat. The innings started <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> note, losing 2 wickets {{on the first day}} itself. On the second day India was bowled out for their second-lowest score ever of 104 runs, with Rahul Dravid scoring the highest score in the innings of 31 runs. Jason Gillespie (4–29) was the main wicket taker for Australia. Australia's first innings also didn't last long, as they were bowled out on the same day for a score of 203 runs, with Martyn (55) top scoring. Murali Kartik (4–44) and Kumble (5–90) were the main wicket takers. 18 wickets fell in all {{on the second day of}} play. India made 205 runs in their second innings, with significant scores from V.V.S. Laxman (69) and Tendulkar (55). Michael Clarke (6–9) removed the tail order within 23 runs. Chasing 107 runs for victory, Australia lost wickets consistently throughout their second innings and were bowled out for 93 runs, giving India a victory by 13 runs. Harbhajan Singh (5–29) and Murali Kartik (3–32) took most of the wickets. Murali Kartik was named Man of the Match. This Test is one of the shortest Test matches ever played, lasting for only 2 complete days. The pitch prepared for the match had later come in for a lot of criticism by Ricky Ponting.|$|E
