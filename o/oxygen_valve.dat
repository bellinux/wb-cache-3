25|$|Cutting is {{initiated}} by heating the edge or leading face (as in cutting shapes such as round rod) {{of the steel}} to the ignition temperature (approximately bright cherry red heat) using the pre-heat jets only, then using the separate cutting <b>oxygen</b> <b>valve</b> to release the oxygen from the central jet. The oxygen chemically combines with the iron in the ferrous material to oxidize the iron quickly into molten iron oxide, producing the cut. Initiating {{a cut in the}} middle of a workpiece is known as piercing.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{laboratory}} under normal gravity conditions {{and with a}} closed <b>oxygen</b> <b>valve,</b> a Bunsen burner burns with yellow flame (also called a safety flame) at around [...] This is due to incandescence of very fine soot particles that are produced in the flame. With increasing oxygen supply, less black body-radiating soot is produced due to a more complete combustion and the reaction creates enough energy to excite and ionize gas molecules in the flame, leading to a blue appearance. The spectrum of a premixed (complete combustion) butane flame on the right shows that the blue color arises specifically due to emission of excited molecular radicals in the flame, which emit most of their light well below ≈565 nanometers in the blue and green regions of the visible spectrum.|$|E
2500|$|The {{failure of}} the two engines in the second stage was traced to the rupturing of a fuel line that fed the engine igniters. The igniter was {{essentially}} a miniature rocket motor mounted in {{the wall of the}} J-2 engine's pressure chamber. It was fed by small-diameter flexible lines carrying liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. [...] During the S-II second stage burn, the hydrogen line feeding the engine number two igniter broke due to vibration. As a result, the igniter fed pure liquid oxygen into the pressure chamber. Normally the J-2 engine burns a hydrogen-rich mixture to keep temperature down. The liquid oxygen flow caused a much higher temperature locally and eventually the pressure chamber failed. The sudden drop in pressure was detected and caused a shutdown command to be issued. Unfortunately, the command signals for engine three were partially cross-wired with engine two, so that the shutdown of engine two caused a liquid <b>oxygen</b> <b>valve</b> for engine three to close, resulting in a shutdown of that engine as well.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical shock {{forced the}} <b>oxygen</b> <b>valves</b> {{closed on the}} number 1 and number 3 fuel cells, leaving them {{operating}} for only about three minutes on the oxygen in the feed lines. The shock also either partially ruptured {{a line from the}} number 1 oxygen tank, or caused its check or relief valve to leak, causing its contents to leak out into space over the next 130 minutes, entirely depleting the SM's oxygen supply.|$|R
25|$|Pure oxygen {{activated}} sludge aeration systems are sealed-tank reactor vessels with surface aerator type impellers mounted within the tanks at the oxygen atmosphere-mixed liquor surface interface. The amount of oxygen entrainment, or DO (Dissolved Oxygen), {{can be controlled}} by a weir adjusted level control, and a vent gas oxygen controlled <b>oxygen</b> feed <b>valve.</b> <b>Oxygen</b> is generated on site by cryogenic distillation of air, pressure swing adsorption, or other methods. These systems are used where wastewater plant space is at a premium and high sewage throughput is required as high energy costs are involved in purifying oxygen.|$|R
25|$|All {{electrical}} wiring {{in the power}} system bay was sheathed in stainless steel, and the oxygen quantity probes were changed from aluminum to stainless steel. The fuel cell <b>oxygen</b> supply <b>valves</b> were redesigned to isolate the Teflon-coated wiring from the oxygen. The spacecraft and Mission Control monitoring systems were modified to give more immediate and visible warnings of anomalies.|$|R
2500|$|The welder {{can adjust}} the {{oxy-acetylene}} flame to be carbonizing (aka reducing), neutral, or oxidizing. Adjustment {{is made by}} adding more or less oxygen to the acetylene flame. The neutral flame is the flame most generally used when welding or cutting. The welder uses the neutral flame {{as the starting point}} for all other flame adjustments because it is so easily defined. This flame is attained when welders, as they slowly open the <b>oxygen</b> <b>valve</b> on the torch body, first see only two flame zones. At that point, the acetylene is being completely burned in the welding oxygen and surrounding air. The flame is chemically neutral. The two parts of this flame are the light blue inner cone and the darker blue to colorless outer cone. The inner cone is where the acetylene and the oxygen combine. The tip of this inner cone is the hottest part of the flame. It is approximately [...] and provides enough heat to easily melt steel. In the inner cone the acetylene breaks down and partly burns to hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which in the outer cone combine with more oxygen from the surrounding air and burn.|$|E

50|$|The launch {{attempt on}} 22 March was aborted {{automatically}} at T-3 seconds when computers detected an incomplete ignition {{of the number}} three Space Shuttle Main Engine.

50|$|First attempt did not fire, {{attention}} was focused around <b>oxygen</b> <b>valve</b> and electronics. The <b>oxygen</b> <b>valve</b> jammed. It {{had not been}} tested, the previous one was stolen along with the oxygen tank at the construction yard in June 2010.The next launch attempt was pushed to June 2011, beyond the launch window ending 17 September 2010, because the rocket might have needed to be taken apart to check the LOX valve, and ignition rods and LOX needed to be replaced. Power to the hairdryer was supplied by Nautilus until the platform was evacuated, but the 20 minutes from then to launch drained the batteries and left the LOX valve unheated so it froze.|$|E

50|$|Several {{anomalies}} {{occurred during}} the flight, but none had {{a major impact on}} the mission. On 22 October 1989, an alarm woke the shuttle crew when the gas generator fuel pump system A heaters on Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) 2 failed to recycle at the upper limits of the system. There were also some minor problems with the Flash Evaporator System for cooling the orbiter, and the cryogenic <b>oxygen</b> manifold <b>valve</b> 2, which was left closed {{for the rest of the}} mission.

An <b>oxygen</b> <b>valve</b> had stuck open and a blocked vent caused the gas to build up until a spark ignited it. However, the potentially catastrophic event was overshadowed in the national news by the launch of Scott Carpenter into space. On June 6, trouble again struck as a flash fire in another silo killed a worker.|$|E

50|$|Glenn {{boarded the}} Friendship 7 {{spacecraft}} at 11:03 UTC on February 20, 1962 following an hour-and-a-half delay {{to replace a}} faulty component in the Atlas's guidance system. The hatch was bolted in place at 12:10 UTC. Most of the 70 hatch bolts had been secured, when one was discovered to be broken. This caused a 42-minute delay while all the bolts were removed, the defective bolt was replaced and the hatch was re-bolted in place. The count was resumed at 11:25 UTC. The gantry was rolled back at 13:20 UTC. At 13:58 UTC the count was held for 25 minutes while a liquid <b>oxygen</b> propellant <b>valve</b> was repaired.|$|R
25|$|The ET {{has five}} {{propellant}} umbilical valves that interface with orbiter umbilicals: {{two for the}} liquid oxygen tank and three for the liquid hydrogen tank. One of the liquid <b>oxygen</b> tank umbilical <b>valves</b> is for liquid oxygen, the other for gaseous oxygen. The liquid hydrogen tank umbilical has two valves for liquid and one for gas. The intermediate-diameter liquid hydrogen umbilical is a recirculation umbilical used only during the liquid hydrogen chill-down sequence during prelaunch.|$|R
50|$|As with {{previous}} expeditions to Mount Everest, supplemental oxygen was taken.

5000|$|The Shuttle's next {{military}} mission {{was put on}} hold after the Challenger disaster, but it {{was carried out by}} Atlantis between 2 and 7 December 1988. The mission was highly classified, so most details are not releasable. Though the countdown was picked up at 0230Z on 1 December, upper level wind shear effects delayed the launch until 2 December. The countdown was picked up again on 2 December, but a problem with a ground feed liquid <b>oxygen</b> <b>valve</b> required a 50-minute unscheduled hold at T minus 180 minutes. Wind shear problems forced another delay at T minus nine minutes for an additional 99 minutes, but the final unscheduled hold (at T minus 31 seconds) only lasted 71 seconds. Atlantis lifted off Pad 39B at 1430:34Z on 2 December. The Shuttle landed at Edwards Air Force Base at 2336:11Z on 6 December 1988.|$|E
50|$|Korzun {{performed}} two spacewalks {{during his}} six-month stay aboard the ISS. On 16 August 2002 Korzun performed his third career spacewalk together with NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson. The two spacewalkers {{got off to}} a late start because they evidently forgot to open an <b>oxygen</b> <b>valve</b> in their Russian Orlan spacesuits while getting prepared and the Pirs docking compartment airlock had to be re-pressurized. Once the valves were set correctly, Korzun reported a pressure leak but the Russian officials declared it as a no issue. By the time the hatch was finally opened almost two hours had been wasted and the spacewalk was cut short to a duration of 4.5 hours. The objective of the spacewalk was to fortify the ISS against damaging space debris. Korzun and Whitson installed six debris panels onto the Zvezda Service Module. They removed the panels from their temporary location on the station's PMA-1 prior to attachment to Zvezda. The panels are designed to shield Zvezda from potential space debris impacts. The spacewalk lasted 4 hours and 25 minutes.|$|E

2500|$|Machine {{malfunction}} or misuse {{may result}} in an inadequate delivery of anesthetic. Many Boyle's machines used in many hospitals have the oxygen regulator serving as a slave to the pressure in the nitrous oxide regulator, to enable the nitrous oxide cut-off safety feature.

50|$|Concorde had to {{deal with}} {{particularly}} high pressure differentials because it flew at unusually high altitude (up to 60000 ft) and maintained a cabin altitude of 6000 ft.

The Concorde also had smaller cabin windows than most other commercial passenger aircraft in order to slow the rate of decompression if a window failed. The high cruising altitude also required the use of high pressure <b>oxygen</b> and demand <b>valves</b> at the emergency masks unlike the continuous-flow masks used in conventional airliners.|$|R
