25|$|Schwantz and Gardner went {{at it for}} 2nd place. Mamola almost highsided {{trying to}} impress the crowd, a bit later on a {{left-hander}} he looked <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> immediately slid the bike into a highside. Schwantz will do something similar next year at Phillip Island. Rainey retired with a punctured tire.|$|E
25|$|After {{striking}} the ball Bradman used an exaggerated follow through, {{so much so}} that his bat would be swung back <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> along his spine, like a golfer. Most batsmen ended their stroke with their bat held high in the air, Bradman's method allowed him to hit the ball with greater power.|$|E
25|$|De Villiers has a {{reputation}} as an outstanding fielder, typified by a diving run-out of Simon Katich of Australia in 2006, when he dived to stop the ball, and while still lying on his stomach facing away from the stumps, he tossed the ball backwards <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> effected a direct hit. This has also led people to make further comparisons of him to Jonty Rhodes, who {{was also one of the}} finest fielders of his generation.|$|E

25|$|In the Philosopher’s Stone he accompanies Harry, Hagrid, Draco, and Hermione {{into the}} Forbidden Forest {{to look for}} an injured unicorn. In the {{following}} book, the Chamber of Secrets, Harry and Ron take Fang into the forest where he is scared stiff of both the gigantic acromantula and Mr Weasley’s flying car. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, an escaping Death Eater sets fire to Hagrid’s hut while Fang is inside; Hagrid enters the flaming hut, slings Fang <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> carries him to safety. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Fang and Hagrid participate in the Battle of Hogwarts; though Fang's exact involvement is not clear. He is last seen running away after a shattered vase frightens him. It's implied that Fang survives, as Hagrid is not seen mourning him at any time. It's unknown if Fang is still alive when Harry's children come to Hogwarts.|$|E
25|$|On {{receipt of}} this news Menéndez sent Diego Flores in advance with forty {{soldiers}} to reconnoitre the French position; he {{himself with the}} chaplain, some officers, and twenty soldiers rejoined Flores at about midnight, and pushed forward {{to the side of}} the inlet opposite their encampment. The following morning, having concealed his men in the thicket, Menéndez dressed himself in a French costume with a cape <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and,</b> carrying a short lance in his hand, went out and showed himself on the river-bank, accompanied by one of his French prisoners, in order to convince the castaways by his boldness that he was well supported. The Frenchmen soon observed him, and one of their number swam over to where he was standing. Throwing himself at his feet the Frenchman explained who they were and begged the Admiral to grant him and his comrades a safe conduct to Fort Caroline, as they were not at war with Spaniards.|$|E

60|$|In a {{few moments}} he was barefoot, his {{stockings}} folded {{in his pockets and}} his canvas shoes dangling by their knotted laces <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and,</b> picking a pointed salt-eaten stick out of the jetsam among the rocks, he clambered down the slope of the breakwater.|$|R
500|$|Improving {{from his}} mediocre {{freshman}} grades, Bradley graduated magna cum laude after writing his senior thesis about Harry S. Truman's 1940 United States Senate campaign, titled [...] "On That Record I Stand", {{and received a}} Rhodes Scholarship at Worcester College, University of Oxford. His tenure at Princeton {{was the subject of}} Pulitzer Prize-winning author John McPhee's January 23, 1965 article [...] "A Sense of Where You Are" [...] in The New Yorker, which McPhee expanded into a book of the same name. The title came from Bradley's explanation for his ability to repeatedly throw a basketball <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> into the basket while looking away from it.|$|E
500|$|To save {{himself from}} future crevasses, Mawson {{constructed}} a rope ladder, which he carried <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> {{was attached to}} the sledge. It paid off almost immediately, and twice in the following days it allowed him to climb from crevasses. Once out of the Mertz Glacier his mileage increased, and on 28 January Madigan Nunatak came into view. The following day, after travelling 5miles, a cairn covered with black cloth appeared about [...] to his right. In it he found food and a note from Archibald Lang McLean, who along with Frank Hurley and Alfred Hodgeman had been sent out by Auroras captain John King Davis to search for the Far Eastern Party.|$|E
500|$|The winning entry was by Angel Gracia and Cliff Guest and {{it showed}} the female protagonist (played by the director's sister Anabel Garcia) being {{supported}} and guided by her girlfriends who introduce her with the male protagonist. The girl even goes to the boy's door to gift him flowers, thereby reversing the usual gender-directed pattern of gift-giving. The male protagonist is portrayed as a [...] "perfect boy" [...] (played by William Fitzgibbon) having the sensibilities like attentiveness, cuteness, playfulness like a friend (after the lyrics [...] "You're my best friend") and not sexual overtones. The video in-turn contrasts him with a self-centered boy who puts on sunglasses, throws his leather jacket <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> walks away from the girl. Other videos portrayed a girl pining for her sailor, US-Soviet relations and an arguing couple with the girl in a scene inspired by the music video of Tina Turner's 1984 single [...] "What's Love Got to Do with It".|$|E

500|$|In sixth grade, {{he went to}} {{live with}} his father {{full-time}} in Harvey, Illinois. His father lived next door to a crack house and taught Fiasco to use guns to defend himself from drug dealers. Despite his unstable upbringing, Fiasco states that he was well-educated as a child, asserting that his parents exposed him to a diverse array of subjects and that reading was highly encouraged in his household. [...] As a teenager, Fiasco participated in Academic Decathlon competitions. [...] His mother described him by saying, [...] "He was a great spirited child. Smart, a bit complex; he kind of was a loner; he didn't hang with a lot of people...He always had the glasses. [...] Always had a book bag <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> some type of a writing tablet." [...] Fiasco initially disliked hip hop music for its use of vulgarity, and preferred to listen to jazz; he idolized clarinet player Benny Goodman. [...] His struggle to learn to play an instrument led him to create poetry instead, which led to his interest in the lyrical aspects of music.|$|E
500|$|Early {{the next}} morning, Nick fills a jar with 50 dew-heavy {{grasshoppers}} found under a log he names a [...] "grasshopper lodging-house", eats breakfast, drinks sweetened coffee {{and makes a}} sliced onion sandwich. After checking and assembling his fly fishing rod and tying on damp leader line, {{he walks to the}} river with a net hanging from his belt, a sack <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> the jar of grasshoppers dangling around his neck. Wading in the water, he fishes the shallows; he lands a trout that [...] "was mottled with clear, water-over-gravel color" [...] that he releases. Moving into a pool of deeper water, he hooks a large trout, [...] "as broad as a salmon", which he loses. After a rest, he moves away from the pool to the more shallow center of the river and catches two trout that he stows in his sack. Sitting on a log, smoking a cigarette and eating his onion sandwich, he thinks about fishing the deep water of the swamp, but decides to wait for another day. At the log in the river, he kills, guts and cleans the two trout before returning to camp.|$|E
500|$|With {{the score}} 2–0 to Reading, the goalkeeper Steve Death {{threw the ball}} to the right back Gary Peters, who spotted Friday {{standing}} near the left-hand corner of the opposing penalty area. Peters passed high and diagonally across the pitch towards his forward, who jumped into the air and used his chest to cushion the ball and knock it into the air with his back to goal, about 25–30 yards away from the net. As Friday landed, he ferociously powered the ball towards goal, kicking <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> turning after the ball had gone. The shot flew straight into the top-right-hand corner of the net, stunning the crowd, players and Thomas, the referee, who put his hands over his head in disbelief. [...] "I'll never forget it", Thomas recalled. [...] "It was the sheer ferocity of the shot on the volley ... over his shoulder. ... If it hadn't gone into the top corner of the net it would have broken the goalpost. Even up against the likes of Pelé and Cruyff, that rates as the best goal I have ever seen." [...] Reading {{went on to win the}} game 5–0. When Thomas told Friday after the game that he had never seen a better goal, the Londoner replied, [...] "Really? You should come down here more often, I do that every week." ...|$|E

The omniscient narrator, still present when the human cargo surrounds Delano and tells him of their woe ("all poured out a common tale") gives way to indirect discourse ("The scurvy...had swept...number...") from the slaves, and thus [...] "moves us so close to Delano's perspective that we witness the scene as if <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> hear the 'clamorous' crowd as if through his ears." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 13 May, McCloughan's company air {{assaulted}} into {{a landing}} zone near Tam Kỳ and Nui Yon Hill, coming under small arms and machine gun fire from defending North Vietnamese Army (NVA) forces. Two helicopters were downed over the landing zone, {{one of which}} crashed around [...] from Company C's positions. A rescue helicopter was prevented from landing due to fierce enemy fire, and a squad was sent out to rescue the pilot and crew. Upon reaching the crash site, they saw a badly wounded soldier sprawled on the ground, and McCloughan ran [...] to him through an open field, dodging the fire of his unit and a charging NVA platoon. After reaching the wounded soldier, McCloughan carried him <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> ran back to Company C, thus saving the man from capture or death.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{liability}} can {{be traced}} from ancient Anglo-Saxon law through the time of Bracton. From Alfred the Great: [...] "A man acts at his own peril. If a man have a spear <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> any man stakes himself upon it, that man will pay the wer but not the wite... if he be accused of wilfulness in the deed, let him clear himself according to the wite, and with that, let the wite abate. And let this be: if the point be three fingers higher than the hindmost part of the shaft; if they both be on the level, {{the point of the}} hindmost part of the shaft, be that without danger. If a man leaves his arms about, and another knocks them over so that they kill or injure a man, the owner is liable. If a man lend his horse to another and the borrower is injured, the lender is liable." [...] This is similar to the modern concept of strict liability in tort. Liability, at that time, was not dependent upon negligence, but the act.|$|E
