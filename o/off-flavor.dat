50|$|Salt {{is added}} when making the flour dough to {{strengthen}} gluten structures {{and enhance the}} sheeting properties of dough, and it can make the noodles softer and more elastic. Salt also offers the basic salty flavor of noodles and can cover some of the <b>off-flavor</b> generated by flour and processing. Another function of salt is {{to slow down the}} activities of enzymes, such as proteolytic enzymes, which could interrupt the gluten structures, and microbial growth. Alkaline salt, such as sodium and potassium carbonates, could be added to noodle dough to enhance the yellow color of the product if needed because flavonoid pigments in flour turns yellow at alkaline pH levels, and the increase of pH could also influence the behavior of gluten, which could make noodle dough even tougher and less extensible (for some noodles, such as Japanese ramen, this is wanted). For making fresh noodles, the amount of salt added is 1-3% of flour weight, but for instant noodles, due to the longer shelf life, it requires higher salt content.|$|E

The objective of this research was to evaluate application of the acid pH-shift method using a shaker sieve for protein recovery and to evaluate consumer acceptability of a resultant batter-coated fried nugget-like catfish product. Farm-raised catfish were either allowed to depurate (control) or treated with 1 ppb GEO or MIB. Fillets from each replicate were collected and ground and treated by the acid pH-shift process. Samples from all treatments and replicates were evaluated for residual GEO and MIB. In addition, batter-coated fried catfish samples were prepared for a consumer sensory evaluation. Results demonstrated that the pH-shift process decreased moisture, ash, and collagen content of catfish fillet tissue (P < 0. 05). Flavor of control samples was preferred (P < 0. 05).

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at finding a {{correlation}} between the experienced <b>off-flavor</b> in packaged foods {{and the presence of}} specific degradation products in PE packaging films. The possibility to trap degradation products by chemical reactions with scavengers, that is, zeolites and maleic anhydride grafted LLDPE, were investigated. This trapping would prevent the degradation products from migrating to the polymer film surface and further into food in contact with the film. This work concludes that <b>off-flavor</b> in water packed in LDPE-films depends on extrusion temperature and the content of oxidation products in the polymer film. At lower extrusion temperatures, reactive additives to the LDPE material could control the release of <b>off-flavor</b> giving components.
