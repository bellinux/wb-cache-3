One rule states that players may not delay their move beyond {{the time that it}} takes for their partner to make three moves.|$|E
5|$|Maine Coons {{have several}} {{physical}} adaptations for survival in harsh winter climates. Their dense water-resistant fur is longer and shaggier on their underside and rear for extra protection {{when they are}} walking <b>or</b> <b>sitting</b> on top of wet surfaces of snow or ice. Their long and bushy raccoon-like tail is resistant to sinking in snow, and can be curled around their face and shoulders for warmth and protection from wind and blowing snow and it can even be curled around their backside like an insulated seat cushion when sitting down on a snow or ice surface. Large paws, and especially the extra-large paws of polydactyl Maine Coons, facilitate walking on snow and are often compared to snowshoes. Long tufts of fur growing between their toes help keep the toes warm and further aid walking on snow by giving the paws additional structure without significant extra weight. Heavily furred ears with extra long tufts of fur growing from inside help keep their ears warm.|$|E
5|$|Merrick's {{condition}} gradually deteriorated {{during his}} {{four years at}} the London Hospital. He required {{a great deal of}} care from the nursing staff and spent much of his time in bed, <b>or</b> <b>sitting</b> in his quarters, with diminishing energy. His facial deformities continued to grow and his head became even more enlarged. He died on 11 April 1890, at the age of 27. At around 3:00p.m., Treves's house surgeon visited Merrick and found him lying dead across his bed. His body was formally identified by his uncle, Charles Merrick. An inquest was held on 15 April by Wynne Edwin Baxter, who had come to notoriety conducting inquests for the Whitechapel murders of 1888.|$|E

5|$|The forelimbs of Plesiorycteropus show specializations for scratch-digging, {{in which}} the forefeet are placed against the substrate, the claws are entered into the substrate, and the forefeet are then drawn back against the body. Other {{parts of the body}} also show such specializations, {{including}} large hindlimbs and a broad tail. Some aspects of the vertebral column and the pelvis suggest that the animal often assumed an erect, <b>or</b> <b>sitting,</b> posture. The animal may also have been capable of climbing, perhaps {{in a manner similar to}} gymnures and shrew tenrecs, which are small-eyed like Plesiorycteropus. It was probably myrmecophagous, eating insects such as ants and termites, but may also have eaten other soft food, and because of its small size probably did not forage in termite mounds, as the aardvark does.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with showing Madonna, the torero (Muñoz), and the townspeople {{preparing}} for, then attending, a bullfight. A secondary staging {{in the video}} presents Madonna standing <b>or</b> <b>sitting</b> near a television set in a room (lit by a single light source from above), while a third staging depicts Madonna writhing around on a bed in her underwear as she watches Muñoz on the television. In the bullring, the torero kills the bull and then comes home and physically and emotionally abuses Madonna. The video {{can be viewed as}} a statement on classicism, supposing the bullfighter feels threatened and angered by the aristocrat's station, resulting in his physically abusing and then coldly abandoning her.|$|E
5|$|Before the Tang Dynasty (618907 AD), the {{predominant}} sitting {{positions in the}} Han Chinese culture and neighboring cultures such as the Japanese Culture, Korean Culture, Turkic Culture in Central Asia and Tai Kadai Cultures to the southwest were the seiza and lotus position on the floor <b>or</b> <b>sitting</b> mats. The earliest images of chairs in China are from sixth-century Buddhist murals and stele, but the practice of sitting in chairs {{at that time was}} rare. It was not until the twelfth century that chairs became widespread in China. Scholars disagree on the reasons for the adoption of the chair. The most common theories are that the chair was an outgrowth of indigenous Chinese furniture, that it evolved from a camp stool imported from Central Asia, that it was introduced to China by Nestorian missionaries in the seventh century, and that the chair came to China from India as a form of Buddhist monastic furniture. In modern China, unlike Korea or Japan, it is not common to sit at floor level.|$|E

25|$|During the Konbaung dynasty, {{at the end}} of the 18th century, the Mandalay {{style of}} the Buddha image emerged, a style that remains popular to this day. There was a marked {{departure}} from the Innwa style, and the Buddha's face is much more natural, fleshy, with naturally-slanted eyebrows, slightly slanted eyes, thicker lips, and a round hair bun at the top. Buddha images in this style can be found reclining, standing <b>or</b> <b>sitting.</b> Mandalay-style Buddhas wear flowing, draped robes.|$|E

The Flightglobal estimated that there was about 3,547 aircraft in inventory in 2015. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, share of modern armament in the Air Force had reached about 35% during 2014. The figure was raised to 66% by late 2016 and to 72% by late 2017.|$|E
25|$|Humans {{experience}} {{their own}} body weight {{as a result}} of this supporting force, which results in a normal force applied to a person by the surface of a supporting object, on which the person is standing <b>or</b> <b>sitting.</b> In the absence of this force, a person would be in free-fall, and would experience weightlessness. It is the transmission of this reaction force through the human body, and the resultant compression and tension of the body's tissues, that results in the sensation of weight.|$|E

25|$|The {{different}} types of urinals, be it for single users or as trough designs for multiple users, are often intended to be utilized from a standing position (rather than squatting <b>or</b> <b>sitting),</b> but designs exist which are intended {{to be used with}} other postures. The term may also apply to a small building or other structure containing such fixtures. It can also refer to a small container in which urine can be collected for medical analysis, or for use where access to toilet facilities is not possible, such as in small aircraft, during extended stakeouts, or for the bedridden.|$|E
25|$|Hon. Cynthia D. Kinser, former Justice (Chief Justice 2011-2014). Because Chief Justice Kinser {{returned}} {{to the practice of}} law after she retired from the court, she is not currently subject to recall for service on the Court because of the ethical conflict this would create between her practice of the law and her role as a justice. Moreover, justices serving in senior status <b>or</b> <b>sitting</b> by designation must be receiving benefits from the Virginia Retirement System, and under the rules applying to judges and justices, receipt of retirement benefits precludes the judge or justice from engaging in the private practice of law.|$|E
25|$|The {{uniqueness}} of Kiribati {{when compared with}} other forms of Pacific island dance is its emphasis on the outstretched arms of the dancer and the sudden birdlike movement of the head. The Frigate bird (Fregata minor) on the Kiribati flag refers to this bird-like style of Kiribati dancing. Most dances are in the standing <b>or</b> <b>sitting</b> position with movement limited and staggered. Smiling whilst dancing is generally considered vulgar {{within the context of}} Kiribati dancing. This is due to its origin of not being solely as a form of entertainment but as a form of storytelling and a display of the skill, beauty and endurance of the dancer.|$|E
