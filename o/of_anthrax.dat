Bush explained that the band gave Ross a complete freedom over {{the concept of the}} artwork. Apart from suggesting the album's title as an idea, Bush said that the other members had not participated much in creating the cover art.|$|E

25|$|The FBI and CDC {{investigation}} has been {{hampered by the}} destruction of a large collection <b>of</b> <b>anthrax</b> spores collected over more than seven decades and kept in more than 100 vials at Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa. Many scientists claim that the quick destruction of the anthrax spores collection in Iowa eliminated crucial evidence useful for the investigation. A precise match between the strain <b>of</b> <b>anthrax</b> used in the attacks and a strain in the collection would have offered hints as to when bacteria had been isolated and, perhaps, as to how widely it had been distributed to researchers. Such genetic clues could have given investigators the evidence necessary to identify the perpetrators.|$|E

25|$|In {{a similar}} vein, {{historian}} Norman Cantor, in In the Wake of the Plague: The Black Death and the World It Made (2001), suggests the Black Death {{might have been}} a combination of pandemics including a form <b>of</b> <b>anthrax,</b> a cattle murrain. He cites many forms of evidence including: reported disease symptoms not in keeping with the known effects of either bubonic or pneumonic plague, the discovery <b>of</b> <b>anthrax</b> spores in a plague pit in Scotland, and the fact that meat from infected cattle was known to have been sold in many rural English areas prior to the onset of the plague. The means of infection varied widely, with infection in the absence of living or recently dead humans in Sicily (which speaks against most viruses). Also, diseases with similar symptoms were generally not distinguished between in that period (see murrain above), {{at least not in the}} Christian world; Chinese and Muslim medical records can be expected to yield better information which however only pertains to the specific disease(s) which affected these areas.|$|E
25|$|On February 16, {{the band}} {{announced}} a live album from the Among the Kings tour which was filmed at {{a show in}} Glasgow, Scotland the night before.

40|$|Background: Anthrax is a soil-borne disease {{caused by}} the {{bacterium}} Bacillus anthracis and is considered a neglected zoonosis. In the country of Georgia, recent reports have indicated {{an increase in the}} incidence <b>of</b> human <b>anthrax.</b> Identifying sub-national areas of increased risk may help direct appropriate public health control measures. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the spatial distribution <b>of</b> human <b>anthrax</b> and identify environmental/anthropogenic factors associated with persistent clusters. Methods/Findings: A database <b>of</b> human cutaneous <b>anthrax</b> in Georgia during the period 2000 – 2009 was constructed using a geographic information system (GIS) with case data recorded to the community location. The spatial scan statistic was used to identify persistence <b>of</b> human cutaneous <b>anthrax.</b> Risk factors related to clusters of persistence were modeled using a multivariate logistic regression. Areas of persistence were identified in the southeastern part of the country. Results indicated that the persistence <b>of</b> human cutaneous <b>anthrax</b> showed a strong positive association with soil pH and urban areas. Conclusions/Significance: Anthrax represents a persistent threat to public and veterinary health in Georgia. The findings here showed that the local level heterogeneity in the persistence <b>of</b> human cutaneous <b>anthrax</b> necessitates directed interventions to mitigate the disease. High risk areas identified in this study can be targeted for public health contro...|$|R
