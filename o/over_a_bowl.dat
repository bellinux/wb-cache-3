500|$|Most of the {{chapters}} address aspects of English food, whether types of food such as meat, eggs, fungi, and bread, or {{ways of dealing}} with food such as salting, drying and preserving. Some chapters such as 'Elizabethan households' are explicitly historical. Every chapter, however, is also a history. For example, chapter V, Meat, discusses [...] "a rather interesting mediaeval miracle" [...] and illustrates a traditional [...] "Colonial Travelling Meat Safe of Mosquito Net". The text switches repeatedly from instructions ("To prepare mutton fat for a mutton piecrust, melt it <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> of hot water") to historical asides ("Mutton fat was used in the mountain-sheep districts for the same purposes as suet or goose-grease in the valleys"). Many of the processes are distinctly old-fashioned; thus, Hartley describes basting, dredging, and frothing, switching between the past and present tenses: [...] "Dredging. This was done between bastings. Thus you dredge with powders or spices to give flavour, or with acid juices, or chopped herbs, which the pouring fat washes down into the crevices of the roasting meat." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jelly can be {{made from}} sweet, savory or hot ingredients. It is made by a process similar to that used for making jam, with the {{additional}} step of filtering out the fruit pulp after the initial heating. A muslin or stockinette [...] "jelly bag" [...] is traditionally used as a filter, suspended by string <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> to allow the straining to occur gently under gravity. It is important not to attempt to force the straining process, for example by squeezing the mass of fruit in the muslin, or the clarity of the resulting jelly will be compromised. Jelly can {{come in a variety of}} flavors such as grape jelly, strawberry jelly, hot chile pepper, and others. It is typically eaten with a variety of foods. This includes jelly with toast, or a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.|$|E
2500|$|Lick My Decals Off, Baby (1970) {{continued}} in a similarly experimental vein.

The Offering included two large stone discs similar to that uncovered in Offering2. Upon each disc was placed a four-legged ceramic vessel and underneath each disc were three stone balls measuring between [...] and placed in a triangle. Also underneath each stone disc was a large tubular jade bead. This offering also contained a ceramic vessel inverted upon another with charcoal between the two, and a large vessel inverted <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> that contained five jadeite beads and a nephrite hacha, together with traces of a red pigment, probably cinnabar.

60|$|The two feasts are so near {{together}} {{in point of}} time {{that they could be}} easily covered by the sentiment of even a brief narrative. Under the agglutinated style of 'A Thanksgiving-Christmas Story,' fiction appropriate to both could be produced, and both could be employed naturally and probably in the transaction of its affairs and the development of its characters. The plot for such a story could easily be made to include a total-abstinence pledge and family reunion at Thanksgiving, and an apparition and spiritual regeneration <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> of punch at Christmas.|$|E
60|$|Do {{you know}} how all these {{memories}} of unfortunate men have come upon me? When they came to frighten me this morning by speaking of my robbed pears, my perforated garden wall, I was reading {{an article in the}} Saturday Review about Rupilius. I have sat near that young man at a public dinner, and beheld him in a gilded uniform. But yesterday he lived in splendor, had long hair, a flowing beard, a jewel at his neck, and a smart surtout.

60|$|I {{ought to}} have doubted, however, the sincerity of the treacherous Italian; indeed, as I never before {{believed}} a word that {{he said in his}} life, I know not why I was so foolish as to credit him now, and go to bed, leaving the keys of our cash-box with him. It contained, after our loss to the cuirassiers, in bills and money, near upon L8000 sterling. Pippi insisted that our reconciliation should be ratified <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> of hot wine, and I have no doubt put some soporific drug into the liquor; for my uncle and I both slept till very late the next morning, and woke with violent headaches and fever: we did not quit our beds till noon.

The shot flew about his ears as thick as may be supposed in such an action, where the Portuguese, to give them their due, fought very briskly, believing at first they were sure of their game, and trusting to their superiority; but there was William, as composed, and in as perfect tranquillity as to danger, as if he had been <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> of punch, only very busy securing the matter, that a ship of forty-six guns should not run away from a ship of eight-and-twenty.|$|E

Surely the softest and milkiest stone that ever was quarried, received that likeness of Miss Pupford!

Miss Pupford being represented in a state of dejection at an open window, ruminating <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> of gold fish, the pupil-mind has settled that the bowl was presented by G, and that he wreathed the bowl with flowers of soul, and that Miss Pupford is depicted as waiting for him on a memorable occasion when he was behind his time.|$|E
60|$|Any body {{may think}} it {{impossible}} for me to express the horrors of my mind at this vision: and even when I awaked, this very dream made a deep impression upon my mind. The little divine knowledge I had, I received from my father's instructions, and that was worn out by an uninterrupted series of sea-faring impiety for eight years space. Except what sickness forced from me, I do not remember I had one thought of lifting up my heart towards God, but rather had a certain stupidity of soul, not having the least sense or fear of the Omnipotent Being when in distress, nor of gratitude to him for his deliverances. Nay, when I was on the desperate expedition on the desert African shore, I cannot remember I had one thought of what would become of me, or to beg his consolation and assistance in my sufferings and distress. When the Portugal captain took me up and honorably used me, nay, farther, when I was even delivered from drowning by escaping to this island, I never looked upon it as a judgment, but only said I was an unfortunate dog, and that's all. Indeed some secret transports of soul I had, which was not through grace but only a common flight of joy, that I was yet alive, when my companions were all drowned, and no other joy could I conceive but what is common with the sailors <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> of punch, after they have escaped the greatest dangers.|$|E
60|$|The {{house had}} an evil {{reputation}} for the hocussing of sailors, which was done {{not only for}} the purpose of plundering them, but also to supply outgoing ships with crews, the men being carried on board insensible, and not coming to until the ship was well down the St. Lawrence. This trade caused the wretches who followed it to be experts in the use of stupefying drugs, and they determined to practise their arts upon their friendless lodger, so as to have an opportunity of ransacking his effects, and of seeing what it might be worth their while to purloin. During the day he invariably locked his door and carried off the key in his pocket, but if they could render him insensible for the night they could examine his boxes at their leisure, and deny afterwards that he had ever brought with him the articles which he missed. It happened, therefore, upon the eve of Huxford's departure from Quebec, that he found, upon returning to his lodgings, that his landlady and her two ill-favoured sons, who assisted her in her trade, were waiting up for him <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> of punch, which they cordially invited him to share. It was a bitterly cold night, and the fragrant steam overpowered any suspicions which the young Englishman may have entertained, so he drained off a bumper, and then, retiring to his bedroom, threw himself upon his bed without undressing, and fell straight into a dreamless slumber, in which he still lay when the three conspirators crept into his chamber, and, having opened his boxes, began to investigate his effects.|$|E
