Of the 4,000,000 acres composing the territory said treaty offers to annex, 1,000,000 or 915,000 acres has in no way been heretofore recognized as other than the private property of the constitutional monarch, subject to a control in now way differing from other items of a private estate.|$|E
25|$|I didn't write any {{songs in}} Henderson, {{but it was}} there I {{realized}} that experiences I had had, things I had seen and heard could be set down {{in a kind of}} music characteristic of my race.

25|$|Since {{my life as}} a {{prisoner}} has begun, I have heard the teachings of the white man's religion, and in many respects believe it to be better than the religion of my fathers... Believing that in a wise way it is good to go to church, and that associating with Christians would improve my character, I have adopted the Christian religion. I believe that the church has helped me much during the short time I have been a member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian, and I am glad to know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have advised all <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>people</b> who are not Christians, to study that religion, because {{it seems to me the}} best religion in enabling one to live right.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, a Royal Stag advert {{featuring}} Harbhajan Singh {{without his}} turban, {{with his hair}} tumbling down over his shoulders, outraged orthodox Sikhs, who burnt effigies {{in the city of}} Amritsar. Sikh clergy and its representative body, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) demanded an apology from Singh and demanded that Pernod Ricard India withdraw the ad, which the SGPC termed, an [...] "offensive representation which has hurt the feelings of Sikhs." [...] Singh later apologised saying, [...] "I apologise. In case I have hurt the feelings <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>people,</b> it was really not my intention." ...|$|E
500|$|Ine was a Christian king, {{who ruled}} as a patron and {{protector}} of the church. [...] The introduction to his laws names his advisors, among whom are Eorcenwald, Bishop of London and Hædde, Bishop of Winchester; Ine says that the laws were also made with the advice and instruction of [...] "all my ealdormen, and chief councillors <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>people,</b> and also a great assembly of the servants of God". [...] The laws themselves demonstrate Ine's Christian convictions, specifying fines for failing to baptize infants or to tithe. Ine supported the church by patronising religious houses, especially in the new diocese of Sherborne, which had been divided from the diocese of Winchester in 705. Ine had opposed this division, ignoring threats of excommunication from Canterbury, but he agreed to it when Bishop Haedde died.|$|E

500|$|... a drug {{mentioned}} in Homer's Odyssey, erases memories; the narrator wonders aloud {{whether he could}} receive [...] "respite" [...] this way: [...] "Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!" [...] Poe also mentions the Balm of Gilead, {{a reference to the}} Book of Jeremiah (8:22) in the Bible: [...] "Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>people</b> recovered?" [...] In that context, the Balm of Gilead is a resin used for medicinal purposes (suggesting, perhaps, that the narrator needs to be healed after the loss of Lenore). He also refers to [...] "Aidenn", another word for the Garden of Eden, though Poe uses it to ask if Lenore has been accepted into Heaven.|$|E
500|$|Lobengula's {{weakened}} Matabele kingdom uneasily coexisted with Rhodes's Company {{settlements in}} Mashonaland {{and north of}} the Zambezi for about another year. The king was angered {{by the lack of}} respect he perceived Company officials to have towards his authority, their insistence that his kingdom was separated from Company territory by a line between the Shashe and Hunyani Rivers, and their demands that he stop the traditional raids on Mashona villages by Matabele impis. After Matabele warriors began slaughtering Mashonas near Fort Victoria in July 1893, Jameson, who Rhodes had appointed Company administrator in Mashonaland, unsuccessfully tried to stop the violence through an indaba. Lobengula complained that the Chartered Company had [...] "come not only to dig the gold but to rob me <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>people</b> and country as well". Monitoring events from Cape Town, Rhodes gauged Jameson's readiness for war by telegraph: [...] "Read Luke 14:31". Jameson wired back: [...] "All right. Have read Luke 14:31".|$|E
500|$|Throughout the 1960s, Makeba {{strengthened}} {{her involvement}} {{with a range}} of black-centred political movements, including the civil rights, anti-apartheid, Black Consciousness, and Black Power movements. She briefly met the Trinidadian-American activist Stokely Carmichael—the leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and a prominent figure in the Black Panther Party—after Belafonte invited him to one of Makeba's concerts; they met again in Conakry six years later. They entered a relationship, initially kept secret from all but their closest friends and family. Makeba participated in fundraising activities for various civil rights groups, including a benefit concert for the 1962 Southern Christian Leadership Conference that civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. referred to as the [...] "event of the year." [...] Following a concert and rally in Atlanta in support of King, Makeba and others were denied entrance to a restaurant as a result of Jim Crow laws, leading to a televised protest in front of the establishment. She also criticised King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference for its investment in South African companies, informing press that [...] "Now my friend of long standing supports the country's persecution <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>people</b> and I must find a new idol". Her identity as an African woman in the US civil rights movement helped create [...] "an emerging liberal consensus" [...] that extreme racial discrimination, whether domestically or internationally, was harmful. In 1964 she testified at the UN for a second time, quoting a song by Vanessa Redgrave in calling for quick action against the South African government.|$|E
