This tradition still stands in 2015, in 2014 Pope Francis crowned Our Lady of Immaculate Conception of Juquila. Since 1989, the act has been carried <b>out</b> <b>through</b> the authorised decree by the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments.|$|E
5|$|By October 1935, {{the ship}} was ready for her first major cruise, when on 25–28 October she visited Madeira, {{returning}} to Kiel on 8 November. The following summer, she cruised <b>out</b> <b>through</b> the Skagerrak and the English Channel into the Irish Sea, before visiting Stockholm on the return voyage.|$|E
5|$|Kauri gum {{formed when}} resin from kauri trees leaked <b>out</b> <b>through</b> {{fractures}} or {{cracks in the}} bark, hardening with the exposure to air. Lumps commonly {{fell to the ground}} and became covered with soil and forest litter, eventually fossilising. Other lumps formed as branches forked or trees were damaged, which released the resin.|$|E
50|$|Although {{pitchers}} seldom get {{credited with}} putouts, they are credited with {{their role in}} getting <b>outs</b> <b>through</b> various pitching statistics such as innings pitched (a measure {{of the number of}} outs made by the pitcher, used in calculating his ERA) and strikeouts.|$|R

5|$|Like other insects, beetles have open circulatory systems, {{based on}} {{hemolymph}} rather than blood. As in other insects, a segmented tube-like heart {{is attached to}} the dorsal wall of the hemocoel. It has paired inlets or ostia at intervals down its length, and circulates the hemolymph from the main cavity of the haemocoel and <b>out</b> <b>through</b> the anterior cavity in the head.|$|E
5|$|The adult {{lifespan}} of {{the double}} drummer is {{about four or five}} weeks. During this time, they mate and reproduce, and feed exclusively on sap of living trees, sucking it <b>out</b> <b>through</b> specialised mouthparts. Female cicadas die after laying their eggs.|$|E
5|$|The entire filmmaking {{process was}} much more complex than that of most Romanian movies made after 1948. The picture stands <b>out</b> <b>through</b> the use of various effects, such as split-screen, {{and the use of}} {{hand-held}} filming.|$|E

5|$|A {{force of}} commandos landed to destroy {{machinery}} and other structures. Heavy German gunfire sank, set ablaze, or immobilised {{virtually all the}} small craft intended to transport the commandos back to England; the commandos had to fight their way <b>out</b> <b>through</b> the town to try to escape overland. Almost all were forced to surrender when their ammunition was expended and they were surrounded and captured by the Wehrmacht defending Saint-Nazaire.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the royal}} forest of Selwood no longer exists, the nearby {{countryside}} is still richly wooded, for example on the Longleat, Maiden Bradley and Stourhead estates. To {{the west of}} the town, {{on the edge of the}} Mendip Hills, there are large active limestone quarries, such as Whatley Quarry and Merehead Quarry, along with disused quarries. The working quarries are served by a dedicated railway line which branches off the main line at Frome, passes through the town centre and <b>out</b> <b>through</b> the Welshmill and Spring Gardens areas in the north-west quadrant of the town.|$|E
5|$|Another {{survivor}} was Katriel Katz, Israeli Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Katz {{had been}} {{expelled from the}} Soviet Union by Andrei Gromyko on 10 June 1967, {{the last day of}} the Six-Day War. During the evacuation from the aircraft, Katz was the only passenger to escape through the forward port door, despite the efforts of Hutchinson and Unwin to stop him using that door. The two flight crew were almost carried <b>out</b> <b>through</b> the door by Katz, who was a large man. Katz was seriously injured jumping from the doorway. He was taken to Hillingdon Hospital, where it was initially feared that he would become the sixth victim of Flight 712. Katz recovered after a few days. He died in 1988 aged 80.|$|E
5|$|At this point, {{the entire}} Austrian force, {{including}} Klenau's column, withdrew into Ulm {{and its environs}} and Napoleon himself arrived to take command of the II, V, VI Corps, Ney's Cavalry and the Imperial Guard, numbering close to 80,000 men. Archduke Ferdinand and a dozen cavalry squadrons broke <b>out</b> <b>through</b> the French army and escaped into Bohemia. Again, {{as he had been}} at Mantua, Klenau was caught in a siege from which there was no escape, and again, he helped to negotiate the terms, when, on 21 October, Karl Mack surrendered the encircled army of 20,000 infantry and 3,273 cavalry. Klenau and the other officers were released on the condition that they not serve against France until exchanged, an agreement to which they held.|$|E

5|$|Canada is {{recognized}} as a middle power for its role in international affairs with a tendency to pursue multilateral solutions. Canada's foreign policy based on international peacekeeping and security is carried <b>out</b> <b>through</b> coalitions and international organizations, and through the work of numerous federal institutions. Canada's peacekeeping role during the 20th century has {{played a major role}} in its global image. The strategy of the Canadian government's foreign aid policy reflects an emphasis to meet the Millennium Development Goals, while also providing assistance in response to foreign humanitarian crises.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{originally}} {{being told}} by Redknapp he was not of Division One standard, let alone suitable for the Premier League, Primus proved his manager wrong by seizing his chance when other players missed <b>out</b> <b>through</b> injury and suspension. By {{the end of the}} 2002–03 season he had become a vital member of the side that won the Division One title, winning the Portsmouth fans' player of the season as well as the PFA accolade for Division One. He scored once that season for Portsmouth in the League Cup against Peterborough United. Primus credits his renaissance to his conversion to Christianity after a friend of his wife's invited him to church.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of a {{cerebrospinal}} fluid leak is performed {{through a combination}} of measurement of the CSF pressure and a computed tomography myelogram (CTM) scan of the spinal column for fluid leaks. The opening fluid pressure in the spinal canal is obtained by performing a lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap. Once the pressure is measured, a radiocontrast agent is injected into the spinal fluid. The contrast then diffuses <b>out</b> <b>through</b> the dura sac before leaking through dural holes. This allows for a CTM with fluoroscopy to locate and image any sites of dura rupture via contrast seen outside the dura sac in the imagery.|$|E

5|$|During {{development}}, Square Enix {{did not pay}} Grin {{over several}} months, and disapproved of the game's Nordic art style. Grin worked to bring the game's art style closer to the Final Fantasy series, but {{after six months of}} development was told that no funding would ever come from Square Enix, and the developer filed for bankruptcy several days later. Word of the project leaked <b>out</b> <b>through</b> art portfolios of those who worked on the project and even a tech demo surfaced. In 2011, Fortress was thought to have been in development by an undisclosed studio, but this was also suspended and the game will not be released in any form.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Katherine Ann Power {{negotiated}} a surrender with authorities and ended 23 years of hiding. Negotiations were carried <b>out</b> <b>through</b> her attorneys Steven Black, a public defender, and Rikki Klieman, a prominent Boston lawyer. On September 15, 1993, she {{pleaded guilty to}} two counts of armed robbery and manslaughter in Boston. At the time, her son Jamie was 14 years old and a freshman in high school, while Power was 44 years old.|$|E
5|$|In October 1834 Richard Weobley, the Clerk of Works, {{received}} {{instructions from}} Treasury officials {{to clear the}} old tally sticks while parliament was adjourned. He decided against giving the sticks away to parliamentary staff to use as firewood, and instead opted to burn them in the two heating furnaces of the House of Lords, directly below the peers' chambers. The furnaces had been designed to burn coal—which gives off a high heat with little flame—and not wood, which burns with a high flame. The flues of the furnaces ran up {{the walls of the}} basement in which they were housed, under the floors of the Lords' chamber, then up through the walls and <b>out</b> <b>through</b> the chimneys.|$|E
