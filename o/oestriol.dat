40|$|A cloned human {{bilirubin}} UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) stably {{expressed in}} Chinese hamster V 79 cells {{was used to}} assess the substrate specificity of the enzyme. The catalytic potential (Vmax/Km(bilirubin) of the enzyme with UDP-glucuronic acid (UDPGA) was 2 -fold and 10 -fold greater than that for UDP-xylose and UDP-glucose respectively. The formation of bilirubin mono- and di-conjugates was found to be dependent on time, UDP-sugar concentration and bilirubin concentration. Ex vivo studies demonstrated that the genetically engineered cell line was capable of the uptake and glucuronidation of bilirubin and the release of bilirubin glucuronide, indicating its usefulness in studying transport processes. Over 100 compounds, including drugs, xenobiotics and endogenous steroids, were tested as substrates for the enzyme to determine the chemical structures accepted as substrates. A wide diversity of xenobiotic compounds such as phenols, anthraquinones and flavones (many of which are in foodstuffs) were glucuronidated by the enzyme. The enzyme also had the capacity to glucuronidate <b>oestriols</b> and oestradiols stereoselectively. H. p. l. c. analysis of the regioselective glucuronidation of beta-oestradiol (E 2) demonstrated that it was conjugated solely at its A-ring hydroxy group by the bilirubin UGT to form E 2 - 3 -glucuronide, this was in contrast with human liver microsomes which formed 3 - and 17 -glucuronides of this oestrogen. Studies utilizing microsomes from a Crigler-Najjar patient and inhibition of E 2 glucuronidation with bilirubin indicated that the cloned expressed bilirubin UGT was the major human UGT isoform responsible for the formation of E 2 - 3 -glucuronide, which is the predominant E 2 conjugate in human urine...|$|R
50|$|Estriol (E3), also spelled <b>oestriol,</b> is a steroid, a weak estrogen, and a minor female sex hormone. It is one {{of three}} major {{endogenous}} estrogens, the others being estradiol and estrone. Levels of estriol in women who are not pregnant are almost undetectable. However, during pregnancy, estriol is synthesized in very high quantities by the placenta and is the most produced estrogen in the body by far, although circulating levels of estriol {{are similar to those of}} other estrogens due to a relatively high rate of metabolism and excretion. Relative to estradiol, both estriol and estrone have far weaker activity as estrogens. Although it is less commonly used than other estrogens, estriol is available for medical use throughout the world in a variety of formulations, including for oral and vaginal administration.|$|E

The product of the reaction, <b>oestriol</b> 16 α-monoglucuronide, was identified by paper chromatography and by crystallization of radioactive product to constant specific radioactivity. The optimum temperature was 37 °C, and the activation energy was calculated to be 11. 1 kcal/mol. The apparent Michaelis–Menten constants for <b>oestriol</b> and UDP-glucuronic acid were 13. 3 and 100 μm respectively. Cu 2 +, Zn 2 + and Hg 2 + inhibited, whereas Mg 2 +, Mn 2 + and Fe 2 + stimulated the enzyme.

40|$|SUMMARY. Saliva {{specimens}} {{were collected}} at weekly intervals {{during the third}} trimester of 61 uncomplicated pregnancies. <b>Oestriol</b> concentrations, measured in samples collected {{in the early morning}} from fasting, recumbent subjects, were used to construct a provisional normal range.

Interlaboratory variation in the assay of salivary <b>oestriol</b> was not sufficient to account for the difference in normal range. It is concluded that consideration should be given to the timing of sample collection if salivary <b>oestriol</b> concentration is to be monitored as a possible means of assessing fetoplacental function.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} maternal oestrogens on the fetal breast development, maternal urinary <b>oestriol</b> excretion, maternal plasma <b>oestriol</b> concentrations, and cord venous plasma oestradiol and <b>oestriol</b> concentrations {{were related to the}} size of the neonatal breast.

There was no cord venous-arterial difference in prolactin concentrations, and neither related to breast diameter. However there was a strong association between breast size and prolactin concentrations in mature infants aged between 5 and 7 days. In preterm infants breast tissue often develops after birth.

40|$|The assay of urinary <b>oestriol</b> as {{a measure}} of foeto=m- {{function}} is now a well=req- established procedure. The test is delayed for at least 24 h by the time taken for urine collections. In addition, urine collections mostly involve expensive hospitali-zation and are subject to many errors. Analysis of maternal blood or of amniotic fluid would obviate these disadvantages and may approach the endocrine state of the foetus more closely. The clinical usefulness of assays on amniotic fluid depends upon the concentration of <b>oestriol</b> in the fluid having a meaningful relationship to <b>oestriol</b> production in the foeto=m- unit.

DESIGN [...] An open, non-randomised cohort study of flushing and non-flushing menopausal women. A before and after investigation {{of the effects of}} vaginal <b>oestriol</b> treatment on the circulation. SETTING [...] Referral based endocrinology clinic. PATIENTS [...] 88 Consecutive menopausal women, 63 complaining of frequent hot flushes and 25 who had not flushed for at least a year. INTERVENTION [...] Treatment with vaginal <b>oestriol</b> 0. 5 mg at night for six weeks in 18 of the women who had hot flushes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] Peripheral blood flow was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography at rest and in response to stressful mental arithmetic and anoxic forearm exercises. Blood flow in the forearm and its variability were significantly higher in flushing than in non-flushing women (4. 1 (SD 1. 7) and 3. 1 (0. 9) ml/ 100 ml tissue/min and 17 % and 13 % respectively).

When MCF- 7 cells were pre-incubated for 96 h with 10 – 9 M ß-oestradiol, 10 – 8 M oestrone or 10 – 8 M <b>oestriol</b> prior to the addition of B[a]P for 24 h, up to a 5 -fold enhanced sensitivity to micronucleus formation was observed with ß-oestradiol and oestrone, while <b>oestriol</b> appeared to reduce levels of micronucleus formation. B[a]P-induced decreases in cell proliferation (per cent binucleate cells) and plating efficiency were reversed by all three oestrogens. Analysis of cell cycle distributions revealed that treatment with oestrogens or B[a]P alone did not induce marked effects on cell cycle distributions. However, in combination oestrogen and B[a]P induced increases in G 0 /G 1, decreases in S phase and increases in G 2 /M. This work suggests that whilst oestrogens appear to enhance carcinogen-induced DNA damage, they also appear, paradoxically, to trigger mechanisms that facilitate clonogenic survival, which may be relevant to breast cancer initiation...|$|E

40|$|Cigarette {{smoking is}} {{associated}} with a reduction in the risk for endometrial cancer in post-menopausal women and {{it has been suggested that}} this is because smoking has an anti-oestrogenic effect. To investigate this, concentrations of oestrone, oestradiol and <b>oestriol</b> were measured in 24 h urine samples from 167 premenopausal women (53 smokers, 114 non-smokers) and 200 post-menopausal women (54 smokers, 146 non-smokers). Among premenopausal women there were no significant differences in oestrogen excretion between smokers and non-smokers. Among post-menopausal women, geometric mean excretion rates for oestrone and oestradiol did not differ significantly between groups, but <b>oestriol</b> excretion was 19 % lower (95 % confidence interval - 34 % to - 1 %) in smokers than in non-smokers. This may partly explain the reduced risk for endometrial cancer among post-menopausal smokers...|$|E
40|$|The urinary {{excretion}} ofendogenous and exogenous oestrogens was {{studied in}} patients with disordered thyroid function, and in obese and non-obese patients without evident thyroid disease. Hypothyroid patients and obese patients converted {{a larger percentage of}} administered oestradiol- 17 =b→ urinary <b>oestriol</b> and a lower percentage to urinary oestrone than hyper-thyroid patients and non-obese patients. The recovery of administered oestradiol as <b>oestriol,</b> oestrone and oestradiol in urine was the same in the hypothyroid, obese and non-obese patients but considerably lower in the hyperthyroid patients. Similar differences were found in the urinary excretion of endogenous oestrogens. The excretion of endogenous oestrogens varies with the weight of the patient; it was greater in the obese than in the non-obese. The findings indicate that the pathways of oestrogen metabolism are influenced by a number of the factors, including thyroid function, associated with the weight of the patient...|$|E
