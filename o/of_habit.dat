Deep brain stimulation has been used to treat adults with severe Tourette's that does not respond to conventional treatment, but it is regarded as an invasive, experimental procedure that is unlikely to become widespread.|$|E
40|$|This essay {{seeks to}} {{contribute}} to growing discussion concerning {{the need for more}} intentional inclusion <b>of</b> <b>habits</b> <b>of</b> mind in curriculum development, particularly in undergraduate general education, and to fuel an examination of the “dialectical” relationship between skills development and the development <b>of</b> <b>habits</b> <b>of</b> mind. The essay begins by generating a tentative curriculum map {{for the development of a}} set <b>of</b> <b>habits</b> <b>of</b> mind. It then provides an overview of the theoretical framework of dialectical analysis, which is used to identify points of synergy between skills development and the development <b>of</b> <b>habits</b> <b>of</b> mind. This essay hopes to enrich and expand the ways we think about undergraduate general education and spiral curriculum design, with the ultimate goal of illuminating the role of undergraduate pedagogy in shaping the academic <b>habits</b> <b>of</b> mind and professional character that we wish our students to develop. Toward that end, this essay encourages us to recognize that our students don’t magically transform from one state to another but instead undergo a gradual stepwise evolution, and to commit ourselves to better understanding precisely how that evolution occurs by examining the dialectical relationship between skills development and the development <b>of</b> <b>habits</b> <b>of</b> mind within our courses and curricula...|$|R

5|$|The {{boundary}} of the eastern Languedoc with the Southern Rhône Valley wine region was moved slightly in 2004, {{with the result that}} Costières de Nîmes AOC is now a Rhône appellation rather than a Languedoc one. In that year, INAO moved the responsibility for oversight of this appellation's wine to the regional committee of the Rhône valley. Local producers of Côtes du Rhône-styled wines made from Syrah and Grenache lobbied for this change since the local winemaking traditions did not coincide with administrative borders, and presumably due to the greater prestige of Rhône wines in the marketplace. Such changes of borders between wine regions are very rare, so out <b>of</b> <b>habit,</b> Costières de Nîmes remains listed as a Languedoc wine in many publications.|$|E
5|$|Roman Catholic priest Servais Pinckaers {{regarded}} Christian ethics as {{closer to}} the virtue ethics of Aristotle than Kant's ethics. He presented virtue ethics as freedom for excellence, which regards freedom as acting in accordance with nature to develop one's virtues. Initially, this requires following rules—but the intention is that the agent develop virtuously, and regard acting morally as a joy. This is in contrast with freedom of indifference, which Pinckaers attributes to William Ockham and likens to Kant. On this view, freedom is set against nature: free actions are those not determined by passions or emotions. There is no development or progress in an agent's virtue, merely the forming <b>of</b> <b>habit.</b> This is closer to Kant's view of ethics, because Kant's conception of autonomy requires that an agent is not merely guided by their emotions, and is set in contrast with Pinckaer's conception of Christian ethics.|$|E

Rheme, dicisign, {{argument}} (also called sumisign, dicisign, suadisign, also seme, pheme, delome, {{and regarded}} as very broadened {{versions of the}} traditional term, proposition, argument): This typology classifies every sign according to the category which the interpretant attributes to the sign's way of denoting its object—the rheme, for example a term, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of quality; the dicisign, for example a proposition, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of fact; and the argument is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect <b>of</b> <b>habit</b> or law. This is the culminating typology of the three, where the sign is understood as a structural element of inference.|$|E
25|$|One major {{criticism}} {{of social and}} psychological explanations of smoking in schizophrenia is that most studies have failed to include personal perspectives of patients with schizophrenia. Studies including personal perspectives find that people with schizophrenia generally start smoking {{for the same reasons}} as the general population, including social pressures and cultural and socioeconomic factors. People with schizophrenia who are current smokers also cite similar reasons for smoking as people without schizophrenia, primarily relaxation, force <b>of</b> <b>habit,</b> and settling nerves. However, 28% cite psychiatric issues, including response to auditory hallucinations and reducing the side effects of medication. The major themes found in studies of personal perspectives are habit and routine, socialization, relaxation, and addiction to nicotine. It is argued that smoking provides structure and activity, both of which may be lacking in the lives of those with serious mental illness.|$|E

His superhuman strength allows him to subdue his prey, uproot trees, throw cars, and crush metal. His bodily tissue is stronger than granite, making him much more durable and tougher than humans as well as contributing slightly to his body weight. He is described as being inhumanly beautiful with refined and perfected features. His scent and voice are enormously seductive to Bella, so much so that he occasionally sends her into a pliant daze entirely by accident. In Twilight, Edward explains that like other vampires, he does not need to breathe, though he chooses to do so out <b>of</b> <b>habit</b> and because it is helpful to smell his environment. He cannot digest regular food, and compares its attractiveness for him to the prospect of eating dirt for a regular person. Like other vampires, Edward is not able to sleep.|$|E
