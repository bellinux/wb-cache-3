5|$|LARP {{has been}} a subject of {{academic}} research and theory. Much <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>research</b> originates from role-players, especially from the publications of the Nordic Knutepunkt role-playing conventions. The broader academic community has recently begun to study LARP as well, both {{to compare it to}} other media and other varieties of interactive gaming, and also to evaluate it in its own right.|$|E
5|$|After {{aftershocks}} {{from the}} quake had concluded, examination took place, producing a focal {{solution to the}} small events. Movement of these shocks {{was similar to that}} of previous earthquakes around the Azores. For these earthquakes, scientists had determined that the conjugate nodal plane was responsible, seeing shearing on the right-lateral (dextral) side. All faulting in this area is strike-slip-oriented, and on a rather large scale. Because <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>research,</b> information now points towards Azores volcanism being controlled by earthquake movement.|$|E

25|$|Wakefield, who did {{not sign}} the retraction, {{currently}} faces disciplinary charges before the General Medical Council over the conduct <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>research.</b> In February 2009 The Sunday Times reported that Wakefield had manipulated patient data and misreported results in his 1998 paper, creating {{the appearance of a}} link with autism.|$|E
25|$|A rather {{surprising}} and unexpected finding <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>research</b> {{is that the}} Percalates genus (i.e. Australian bass and estuary perch) appears to be genetically closer to the Maccullochella genus (i.e. Murray cod and other cod species) than the remnant Macquaria genus is (i.e. golden perch and Macquarie perch).|$|E
25|$|Janneke Balk and Christopher J. Leaver, of the Department of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford, {{carried out}} {{research}} on mutations in the mitochondrial genome of sun-flower cells.

30|$|<b>Of</b> course, <b>this</b> <b>research</b> alone cannot resolve such {{a complex}} question.

25|$|As {{the primary}} source of {{biofuels}} in North America, many organizations are conducting {{research in the area of}} ethanol production.

25|$|The Hebrew University of Jerusalem {{has been}} a centre <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>research,</b> {{including}} Scholem and Isaiah Tishby, and more recently Joseph Dan, Yehuda Liebes, Rachel Elior, and Moshe Idel.

25|$|The {{first stage}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>research,</b> which began on 24 August 1998, {{involved}} a simple RFID transmitter being implanted beneath Warwick's skin, {{which was used}} to control doors, lights, heaters, and other computer-controlled devices based on his proximity.

25|$|Although {{there is}} {{evidence}} that children up to the age of twelve years do tend to be in the first two of these stages, adults over the age of sixty-one show considerable variation in displays of qualities of Stages 3 and beyond, most adults remaining in Stage 3 (Synthetic Conventional).

25|$|The US {{was kept}} apprised <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>research.</b> While {{discussing}} {{it in the}} fall of 1941, Bowen and Alvarez entered a heated debate about the proper antenna design for ground mapping systems. Bowen was convinced that the antenna had to be highly accurate in both azimuth and elevation, in order to provide reasonable resolution. Improving resolution over that of H2S would either require larger antennae that would be unwieldy, or decreasing the wavelength of the transmitter beyond the state of the art.|$|E

25|$|Deletion of the Trsp gene in osteochondroprogenitor cells {{results in}} {{abnormal}} bone growth, delayed ossification, chondronecrosis and dwarfism. General Trsp gene deletion is lethal to the embryo. The results <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>research</b> {{was used as}} a model for Kashin-Beck disease. Kashin-Beck is a result of combinatorial environmentally induced by factors such as: toxic mould, contaminated grains by mycotoxins, and mostly by selenium deficiency, which is necessary for selenoprotein function. The disease has symptoms similar to those resulting from Trsp gene knockout.|$|E
