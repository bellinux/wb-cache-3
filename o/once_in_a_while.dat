5|$|Right now, we are {{currently}} pursuing a long arch series for cable. We wondered, should we do a sequel to the first one or do we do a remake? We {{came up with a}} 'requel' – it's a sequel and a remake. We've been developing this for a while. It's a trilogy in four parts, and it really follows the continuing adventures of new people who are experiencing this phenomenon of a Klown invasion, and <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> you see some of the old guys pop up and hear their stories – find out what happened over the last 25 years. It's fucking great.|$|E
5|$|As {{the player}} moves from world to world, eradicating the Heartless, Chirithy has brief conversations {{with one of}} the Foretellers and another Chirithy {{regarding}} concerning events. <b>Once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> the player return to Daybreak Town where they meet another Keyblade wielder named , who is part of a rival union. He wishes to explore a mysterious tower that lies within the center of the town, and against Chirithy's wishes, the player agrees to help find a way in. Ephemer, however, abandons the player to explore the tower himself. During the player's exploration, the tower is discovered to be the base of the Foretellers, and while there, the player is confronted by Master Ava, the Foreteller they had met previously. She challenges the player to test their strength, and afterwards tells the player they have sadness in their hearts, which links them to the darkness. Undeterred, the player continues their mission and later meets another Keyblade wielder named , who comes from Ephemer's union. She expresses an interest in further exploring the mysterious tower of the Foretellers. She and the player encounter warring Foretellers from different unions and new kinds of Heartless that are revealed to be corrupted Keyblade wielders as well as a dark vision of Chirithy called Nightmare Chirithy (who is the same Chirithy that had been speaking with the player's).|$|E
25|$|Water in {{a closed}} jar with an air space over it forms a two phase system. Most of the water is in the liquid phase, where it is held by the mutual {{attraction}} of water molecules. Even at equilibrium molecules are constantly in motion and, <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> a molecule in the liquid phase gains enough kinetic energy {{to break away from}} the liquid phase and enter the gas phase. Likewise, every <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> a vapor molecule collides with the liquid surface and condenses into the liquid. At equilibrium, evaporation and condensation processes exactly balance and there is no net change in the volume of either phase.|$|E

25|$|She {{then said}} she would sing only <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> but after a year's absence, {{she was no longer}} able to resist the appeal of the music. She {{returned}} in 1962 concentrating on recording and performing live, by then at a slower pace.|$|E
25|$|In the Western world, between 10 and 20% of the {{population}} are affected by GERD. Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> without significant symptoms or complications, is more common. The condition was first described in 1935 by the American gastroenterologist Asher Winkelstein. The classic symptoms had been described earlier in 1925.|$|E
25|$|Reduplication is only {{marginally}} used in Esperanto. It has an intensifying effect {{similar to that}} of the suffix -eg-. The common examples are plenplena (chock-full), from plena (full), finfine (finally, at last), from fina (final), and fojfoje (<b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while),</b> from foje (once, sometimes). So far, reduplication has only been used with monosyllabic roots that don't require an epenthetic vowel when compounded.|$|E

5000|$|The Christian Science Monitor {{reviewed}} {{this book}} in 1985: [...] "Every <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> long <b>while,</b> one finds <b>a</b> book that wholly captures the mood and essence of an era.

25|$|For first-order tableaux without unification, the {{condition}} of fairness is similar, with the exception that the rule for universal quantifier might require more than one application. Fairness amounts to expanding every universal quantifier infinitely often. In other words, a fair policy of application of rules cannot keep applying other rules without expanding every universal quantifier in every branch that is still open <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{initial entry}} charge per person was sixpence, {{which was a}} sizable sum {{at the time and}} limited {{admission}} to relatively wealthy middle-class people. What made Dublin Zoo very different from some of its contemporaries was a decision to reduce the charge to one penny on Sundays. This made a day at the zoo something that nearly every Dubliner could afford <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> and it became very popular.|$|E
25|$|Midori is an {{energetic}} girl in Tatsuya's class {{who has been}} one of his classmates since their first year in high school. She is the clarinet leader in the concert band at her school. She seems to be very desperate for Tatsuya's odd sign of affection or even perhaps noticing her <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> She is only available as a love interest in the PS2 and PSP versions of the game, and is otherwise a minor character.|$|E

60|$|This {{particular}} Thanksgiving {{tide was}} marked in Mapleton by exceptionally charming weather. <b>Once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> great <b>while</b> the inclement New England skies are {{taken with a}} remorseful twinge and forget to give their usual snap of September frost which generally bites off all the pretty flowers <b>in</b> so heart-breaking <b>a</b> way, {{and then you can}} have lovely times quite down through November.|$|R
25|$|Yoshimi is {{a second}} year student from class 2-C, Leo's classmate {{and a member of}} the student council. She is popular with everyone, she is an honour student, is quick in her movements, is a good cook, and is sweet-tempered. She puts the brakes on Erika Kiriya <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> for Erika tends to go her own way without {{consulting}} anyone. She at first appears to be a very mature person, however, her true nature is quite the opposite. Erika is her close friend who understands her true self. She often approaches Leo, who does not notice Yoshimi's deep feelings for him.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes an {{exhibition}} race is held {{after all the}} meaningful races are run with all the amateur class winners from Novice up to Expert and including the Open, girls classes and perhaps Cruiser classes race together once. This is called the Trophy Dash. Like in the Open Classes, no points are rewarded in this case, just a chance for bragging rights and to match yourself up against people that are at a higher skill level. Only one race for a single first-place trophy is awarded. As in the Opens the Expert usually wins with the Intermediate winner pulling one out every <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> Novices usually win only when a major, catastrophic pile up occurs on the track and even then the mass smash up has to happen quite close to the finish line.|$|E
25|$|Directly east {{of these}} areas, the weather becomes much harsher: {{precipitation}} drops to between 150 and 300mm, the mountains no longer protect the cities from the wind, and temperatures become more extreme. Maquinchao {{is a couple}} hundred kilometers east of Bariloche, at the same altitude on a plateau, and summer daytime temperatures are usually about 5°C warmer, rising up to 35°C sometimes, but winter temperatures are much more extreme: the record is −35°C, {{and it is not}} uncommon to see some nights 10°C colder than Bariloche. The plateaus in Santa Cruz province and parts of Chubut usually have snow cover through the winter, and often experience very cold temperatures. In Chile, the city of Balmaceda is known for being situated in this region (which is otherwise almost exclusively in Argentina), and for being the coldest place in Chile, with temperatures below −20°C every <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b>|$|E

5000|$|... "Both as Business and Art, it is {{intolerable}} {{to have in}} {{your beautiful}} pageant some of the frightful anachronisms now there. The Babbits don’t realize them; but every <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> great <b>while</b> someone will go to see the Mission Play who will know that Father Serra didn’t teach the California Indians to weave dam sic bad Navajo blankets!"— Charles F. Lummis to John McGroarty regarding The Mission Play, 1926.|$|R
25|$|Paris {{was a world}} {{center of}} the arts but the fierce {{competition}} between artists proved too much for Nadir Afonso. In 1965, conscious of his social inadaptation, he moved back to his hometown of Chaves and gradually took refuge in isolation and accentuated the orientation of his life towards the creation of art. He terminated the architecture practice and pursued his aesthetics studies based on geometry, which he considered the essence of art. <b>Once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> he left his hideout to return to Paris and meet with friends, author Roger Garaudy, painter Victor Vasarely, and critic Michel Gaüzes. By indication of Garaudy, he traveled to Toulouse to meet aestheticist Pierre Bru, with whom he reviewed the syntactic form of his studies, before publishing Les Mécanismes de la Création Artistique (The Mechanisms of Artistic Creation), the book where he introduced his original theory of art as an exact science.|$|E
25|$|Johnson's {{trial began}} in late March. With a {{predominantly}} Republican Senate, Johnson's impeachment seemed to many a foregone conclusion. However, throughout the process, several senators began showing hesitance {{to remove the}} President from office. Stanton, meanwhile, had remained barred in the War Department's headquarters for weeks, sneaking off <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to visit his home. When it seemed to Stanton that Johnson would not remove him forcefully from office, he began spending more time at home. Stanton watched closely as the trial, which he was convinced would end with Johnson's conviction, continued for several months. When {{it came time to}} vote, 35 voted to convict, 19 to acquit, falling one short of the 36-vote supermajority needed for a conviction. The remaining proceedings were delayed for several days for the Republican National Convention. On May 26, after Johnson had been acquitted on all of the ten other charges, Stanton submitted his resignation to the President.|$|E
500|$|Hamilton checked if the ORNL high-flux reactor {{produced}} californium for {{a commercial}} order: the required berkelium could be obtained as a by-product.

Hamilton kept monitoring the situation, making the checks <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> (Later, Oganessian referred to Hamilton as [...] "the father of 117" [...] for doing this work.) ...|$|E
60|$|But {{the past}} was not dead. <b>Once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> great <b>while,</b> the {{thoughts}} that had seemed so vital and so active, yet had been put to rest so quietly, revived again. One {{of the most remarkable}} occasions, when the habit of bygone days awoke in me, was that which brings it within the law of literary propriety to offer the public the sketch which I am now writing.|$|R
50|$|Ryan Karazija {{subsequently}} {{relocated to}} Reykjavík, Iceland {{and started the}} new band Low Roar, releasing <b>a</b> self-titled album <b>in</b> 2011. <b>A</b> second album, 0 was released in 2014 by Tonequake Records, followed by <b>Once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Long, Long <b>While</b> <b>in</b> mid-2017.|$|R
60|$|Dr. Zabrinsky {{was true}} to his word. He {{did all that}} was {{possible}} for the sufferer, and between his medical skill and Matt's watchful care, Mr. Lincoln recovered rapidly. <b>Once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> great <b>while</b> his mind would take on a flighty turn, but Matt was watchful and always calmed him down, {{and at the end}} of six months the man whose mind had been so strangely affected was as rational and well as ever.|$|R
500|$|First Lady Barbara Bush paraphrased {{the film}} in her 1990 {{commencement}} address at Wellesley College: [...] "Find the joy in life, because as Ferris Bueller said on his day off, 'Life moves pretty fast; if you don't stop and look around <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> you could miss it!'" [...] Responding to the audience's enthusiastic applause, she added [...] "I'm {{not going to tell}} George ya clapped more for Ferris than ya clapped for George." ...|$|E
500|$|The choreography, {{in which}} Astaire was {{assisted}} by Hermes Pan, is principally concerned throughout with {{the possibilities of}} using taps to make as much noise as possible. In the film, Astaire [...] suffers from what Rogers terms an [...] "affliction": [...] "Every <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> I suddenly find myself dancing." [...] Astaire introduces the film's tap motif when he blasts a tap barrage at the somnolent members of a London Club. There are eight musical numbers.|$|E

60|$|But, as {{the years}} went by, this thing he dreaded did not happen. Sara did not marry, {{although}} gossip assigned her many suitors not unworthy of her. She and Jeffrey were always friends, although they met but seldom. Sometimes she sent him a book; it was his custom to search for the earliest mayflowers and take them to her; <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> long <b>while</b> they met and talked of many things. Jeffrey's calendar from year to year was red-lettered by these small happenings, of which nobody knew, or, knowing, would have cared.|$|R
