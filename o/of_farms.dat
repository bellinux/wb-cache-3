When based on sources <b>of</b> <b>farm</b> income, farms are classified as grain farms, hay farms, fruit farms, dairy farms, etc., according to the proportionate magnitude of the income from the different sources. When the number <b>of</b> <b>farm</b> enterprises is used as the basis, farms are classified as specialized or diversified. When the amount of labor, capital and management applied to the acre of land is used as the basis, farming {{is said to be}} either extensive or intensive.

Of particular note, Abu Bakar appointed two Chinese leaders to the Johor State Council: a Kangchu from Chaozhou, Tan Hiok Nee, and a contractor from Taishan, Wong Ah Fook, who also owned gambier and pepper farms in Mersing in the 1880s. As the land along the river banks in Southern Johor was already taken by the earlier waves of Chinese settlers, newer Chinese settlers began migrating northwards in the 1870s and established new gambier and pepper plantations further north; new plantations were established in Yong Peng, Batu Pahat, Benut, Endau and Kota Tinggi. In particular, Abu Bakar actively encouraged Chinese settlers to establish plantations in Muar, shortly after the British Colonial Government ruled in favour of Abu Bakar over Tengku Alam Shah (Sultan Ali's eldest son) and his family, and granted Abu Bakar control of Muar.|$|E
