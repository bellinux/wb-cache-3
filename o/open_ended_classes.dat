40|$|An <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> list is a {{well known}} data {{structure}} in Prolog programs. It is frequently used to represent a value changing over time, while this value is referred to from several places in the data structure of the application. A weak point in this technique is that the time complexity is linear {{in the number of}} updates to the value represented by the <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> list. In this programming pearl we present a variant of the <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> list, namely an <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> tree, with an update and access time complexity logarithmic in the number of updates to the value. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Journal of European Industrial Training [© Emerald]. The definitive version is available at: www. emeraldinsight. com/ 0309 - 0590. htm. Purpose - This study examines participant’s response rate on dual style training course evaluation forms. These combine structured and <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> formats. Pencil and paper forms {{have a long history of}} use by trainers in business and commerce and more recently in education. Research methods texts tend to have neglected the issue of response rates with this type of form. Design/methodology/approach - Approximately 2000 course participants attending 28 courses completed evaluation forms. These were designed with a series of structured responses scales followed by a section for <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> comments. Findings – It was found the completion rate for the <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> sections was low and thus validity was suspect. Various explanations were offered for this. Subsequently when a redesigned evaluation form was administered to a further 1641 course participants it was found response rates increased dramatically when <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> sections were placed earlier in the questionnaire. Practical implications – Indicates ways in which course evaluation forms can be redesigned to increase response rates for <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> sections and thus improve the validity of any findings. Originality/value – Provides information about response rates neglected by most methodology texts concerning the design of training evaluation questionnaires which include <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> sections...|$|R

40|$|We {{experimentally}} investigated propagation {{characteristics of}} the shock wave driven by a gaseous detonation wave emerging from the <b>open</b> <b>end</b> of a cylindrical detonation tube. In the present study, we visualized the shock wave and exhaust flowfields using a shadowgraph optical system and we obtained peak overpressure in the tube axial direction and the continuous shape transformation of shock waves around the tube <b>open</b> <b>end.</b> We also obtained overpressure histories of the shock wave using piezo-pressure transducers within 201 m from the <b>open</b> <b>end</b> of the tube. We normalized and classified these results by four regions using non-dimensional pressure and distance which are independent of variety of mixture and tube diameter. In {{the vicinity of the}} <b>open</b> <b>end</b> of the tube, the shock wave is nearly planar and does not significantly attenuate, and the peak overpressure maintains approximately C–J pressure. Subsequently, the shock wave attenuates rapidly, transforming from quasi-spherical to spherical. Farther from the tube <b>open</b> <b>end,</b> the shock wave propagates with approximately sound characteristic so that the peak overpressure decreases proportional to 1 /r. Eventually, the shock wave begins to attenuate more rapidly than ideal sound attenuation, which {{may be due to the}} viscous effect...|$|R
