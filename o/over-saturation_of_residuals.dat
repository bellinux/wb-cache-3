The appropriate buffer size estimation is one of primary tasks in MBAC for QoS parameters guarantee. Hurst parameter which describes the level of self-similarity is used for this purpose.

As such, this research constitutes an effective implementation of the Hitchcock Transportation Algorithm for solving a transshipment problem applied to parking lot distribution. Because the Hitchcock Algorithm considers the network cost for distributions, it gives very realistic solutions, and so a system equilibrium that minimizes overall system delay has been achieved through optimal parking assignment combined with pre- and post-game traffic control strategies.

To certify the accuracy of numerical analysis, the residual stresses were measured by the hole drilling strain gage method and the crack propagation tests. The experiments were carried out on two types of compact tension (CT) specimens in accordance with ASTM Regulation.
