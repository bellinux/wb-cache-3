However, the expense of the larger ships was prohibitive, and many of them stayed in shipyards half-completed, in readiness for another war, until the Age of Sail had almost completely passed. The main force of the Navy continued to be large sailing frigates with a number of smaller sloops during the three decades of peace. By the 1840s, the Navy began to adopt steam power and shell guns, but they lagged behind the French and British in adopting the new technologies.|$|E
5|$|Brettingham was {{commissioned}} in 1742 to redesign Langley Hall, a mansion standing {{in its own}} parkland in South Norfolk. His design {{was very much in}} the Palladian style of Holkham, though much smaller: a large principal central block linked to two flanking secondary wings by short corridors. The corner towers, while similar to those later designed by Brettingham at Euston Hall, were the work of a later owner and architect. The neoclassical entrance lodges were a later addition, by Sir John Soane. In 1743, Brettingham began work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> of Hanworth Hall, Norfolk, also in the Palladian style, with a five-bay facade of brick with the centre three bays projected with a pediment.|$|E

5|$|By 1285, Caernarfon's town {{walls were}} mostly complete. At {{the same time}} work {{continued}} on the castle. Spending on construction was negligible from 1289 and accounts end in 1292. EdwardI's campaign of castle-building in Wales cost £80,000 between 1277 and 1304, and £95,000 between 1277 and 1329; by 1292 £12,000 had been spent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> of Caernarfon's castleof which the southern facade was furthest alongand town walls.

This eventually consisted of 35 volumes with 39 appendices or supplements. It was written in the immediate postwar years by the chemists, metallurgists, physicists, and administrators who had worked on the project. Since there were no security restrictions, it covered every aspect of the Manhattan Project, but was itself classified.

5|$|In 1832, John Barbour built a sawmill on Loyalsock Creek {{near the}} mouth of Plunketts Creek. This {{developed}} into the village of Barbours Mills, today known as Barbours. In the 19th century, Barbours had several blacksmiths, a temperance hotel, post office, many sawmills, a school, store and wagon maker. In 1840, a road was built north from Barbours along Plunketts Creek, crossing it several times. This is the earliest possible date for construction of the bridge, but the surviving county road docket <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> mentions neither bridges nor fords for crossing the creek.|$|E
