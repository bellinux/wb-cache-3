5|$|Terrestrial weather occurs almost {{exclusively}} in {{the lower part of}} the atmosphere, and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat. <b>Ocean</b> <b>currents</b> are another important factor in determining climate, particularly the major underwater thermohaline circulation which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions. These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones. Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the <b>ocean</b> <b>currents</b> and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the polar regions much colder.|$|E

As we known that fossil fuel resources in the world are limited and we can’t depend on them for the future energy needs of the world. For this purpose the researcher have find such sources of energy which are sustainable, green, environment friendly and have no impact on human lives, which includes renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and ocean energy sources.

5|$|Climate is {{a measure}} of the {{long-term}} trends in the weather. Various factors are known to influence the climate, including <b>ocean</b> <b>currents,</b> surface albedo, greenhouse gases, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the Earth's orbit. Based on historical records, the Earth is known to have undergone drastic climate changes in the past, including ice ages.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{navigation}} {{system of the}} AUV usually takes SINS as the core, and is supplemented by GPS and DVL. While the output speed of the DVL is relative to the water, and the relative speed is taken as the observed quantity to assist SINS, the navigation accuracy will be declined. In order to solve the problem, SINS/GPS/DVL integrated navigation method is proposed to estimate the <b>ocean</b> <b>current</b> model. In this method, the Kalman filter is used to estimate the <b>ocean</b> <b>current</b> based on the <b>ocean</b> <b>current</b> model, and then the speed relative to the seabed is gained and taken as the measurements for assisting the SINS. Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed method can estimate accurately the <b>ocean</b> <b>current</b> speed...|$|R

In this paper, we study the estimation and forecast of depth-averaged <b>ocean</b> <b>current</b> using underwater gliders. By considering three factors: the seawater density difference, the pressure hull compression deformation and the unstable depth intervals of a profile, we build a model for rapid calculation of underwater gliders&# 39; horizontal speed in order to improve the accuracy of the estimated depth-averaged <b>ocean</b> <b>current.</b> Then we adopt a novel machine learning model to forecast the depth-averaged <b>ocean</b> <b>current</b> of the next profile.

5|$|Together {{with the}} trade winds, the {{westerlies}} enabled a round-trip trade route for sailing ships crossing the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as the westerlies {{lead to the}} development of strong <b>ocean</b> <b>currents</b> on the western sides of oceans in both hemispheres through the process of western intensification. These western <b>ocean</b> <b>currents</b> transport warm, sub tropical water polewards toward the polar regions. The westerlies can be particularly strong, especially in the southern hemisphere, where there is less land in the middle latitudes to cause the flow pattern to amplify, which slows the winds down. The strongest westerly winds in the middle latitudes are within a band known as the Roaring Forties, between 40 and 50degrees latitude south of the equator. The Westerlies {{play an important role in}} carrying the warm, equatorial waters and winds to the western coasts of continents, especially in the southern hemisphere because of its vast oceanic expanse.|$|E
5|$|A greater misfortune {{occurred}} {{at the onset of}} the southern winter when the Aurora, locked in an ice-floe which broke off from the main shelf, was torn from its moorings. The <b>ocean</b> <b>currents</b> then pulled ship further away from the sledding parties marooned on shore and drifted for over six months before breaking free of the ice. Sadly the Aurora's damaged rudder forced her to return to New Zealand rather than returning for the stranded shore party.|$|E
5|$|A severe {{regression}} {{would have}} greatly reduced the continental shelf area, {{which is the}} most species-rich part of the sea, and therefore could have been enough to cause a marine mass extinction, however, research concludes that this change would have been insufficient to cause the observed level of ammonite extinction. The regression would also have caused climate changes, partly by disrupting winds and <b>ocean</b> <b>currents</b> and partly by reducing the Earth's albedo and therefore, increasing global temperatures.|$|E

Without accurate daily longitudinal information from the other ships, Arniston had to rely instead on older, less accurate navigation methods.

40|$|In this paper, {{we review}} an {{acoustic}} method for measuring both average <b>ocean</b> <b>current</b> speed and sound speed along an acoustic path. The method requires {{two or more}} stations on the sea floor, synchronized through a connecting underwater electric cable, that can transmit and receive an acoustic signal and The method is based on reciprocal acoustic transmissions to determine time of flight in both the forward and reverse directions. A specific implementation of this method is proposed. We also consider a novel method for monitoring <b>ocean</b> <b>current</b> perturbations through acoustic phase measurements. In simplest form, a continuous sinusoidal signal is transmitted from one station to a second station. Any variations in <b>ocean</b> <b>current</b> speed will introduce a phase shift in the received signal proportional to the time derivative of the current speed. This effect has been demonstrated through ultrasonic in-air experiments. Finally, the two methods are combined into a single system that continuously measures small-scale <b>ocean</b> <b>current</b> velocity changes...|$|R

5|$|During the Eocene, rodents {{began to}} diversify. Beavers {{appeared}} in North America {{in the late}} Eocene before spreading to Eurasia. Late in the Eocene, hystricognaths invaded Africa, most probably having originated in Asia at least 39.5 million years ago. From Africa, fossil evidence shows that some hystricognaths (caviomorphs) , which was an isolated continent at the time, evidently making use of <b>ocean</b> <b>currents</b> to cross the Atlantic on floating debris. Caviomorphs had arrived in South America by 41 million years ago (implying a date at least {{as early as this}} for hystricognaths in Africa), and had reached the Greater Antilles by the early Oligocene, suggesting that they must have dispersed rapidly across South America.|$|E
40|$|Using {{new global}} {{satellite}} remote sensing data, {{we show that}} ignoring the <b>ocean</b> <b>current</b> dependence in the wind stress artificially increases global wind power input to the oceanic general circulation by about 32 %, and more than doubles the input in the regions of strong <b>ocean</b> <b>current</b> systems. Scatterometer-derived wind stress naturally accounts for the moving ocean that {{is not included in}} traditional wind stress products. However, forcing an ocean model with a scatterometer-derived wind stress cannot actually account for the <b>ocean</b> <b>current</b> effect on the wind power input. The difference between the real and modeled surface eddy fields can reduce the damping associated with the <b>ocean</b> <b>current</b> dependence in wind stress, leading to a positive bias in global wind power input of about 23 %. Most of this spurious energy flux goes directly to the fluctuation eddy field and is several times larger than the energy flux to real ocean eddies. <br/...|$|R

5|$|Growth is slow, and the veligers {{are carried}} by the <b>ocean</b> <b>currents</b> for up to 14 weeks. As the veligers mature, they develop their first shell (the smooth protoconch) and turn into very small {{juvenile}} snails, at which point they sink to the ocean floor. As {{is the case in}} all shelled mollusks, the mantle is what secretes the shell; shell growth begins at what will later become the apex of the shell, and typically rotates clockwise. As the animal gradually matures, the mantle continues to secrete shell material. Scotch bonnets complete maturation in one to six years. However, some have lived more than six years.|$|E
