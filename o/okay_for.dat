25|$|Clenora Hudson-Weems's Africana womanism {{arose from}} a {{nationalist}} Africana studies concept. In Africana Womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves, Hudson-Weems explores {{the limitations of}} feminist theory and explains the ideas and activism of different African women who have contributed to womanist theory. At its core, Africana womanism rejects feminism because it is {{set up in a}} way as to promote the issues of white women over the issues of Black women. Hudson-Weems argues that feminism will never be <b>okay</b> <b>for</b> black women due to the implications of slavery and prejudice. She further asserts that the relationship between a Black man and a Black woman is significantly different from the relationship between a White man and a White woman, because the white woman battles the white man for subjugating her, but the black women battles all oppressive forces that subjugate her, her children, and the black man. She further asserts that racism forced African-American men and African-American women to assume unconventional gender roles. In this context, the desire of mainstream feminism to dismantle traditional gender roles becomes inapplicable to the black experience. Unlike womanism, Africana womanism is an ideology designed specifically with women of African descent in mind. It is grounded in African culture and focuses on the unique struggles, needs, and desires of African women. Based on this reasoning, Africana Womanism posits race- and class-based oppression as far more significant than gender-based oppression.|$|E

In 2006, there was international uproar when Saudi authorities sought to prevent women from attending a game between the Saudi Arabia national football team and the Sweden national football team.

Kinberg confirmed that the film would make fun of Deadpool's portrayal in X-Men Origins: Wolverine. It also makes jokes at that expense of Green Lantern. While Miller {{felt that it was}} <b>okay</b> <b>for</b> audience members to not understand all of the jokes in the film, he wanted to avoid things specifically targeted to comic fans, saying that [...] "any joke that an audience needs to look up on the internet after the movie is not something I’m in favour of." [...] The film's post-credits scene is a parody of the equivalent scene from Ferris Bueller's Day Off, where the title character breaks the fourth wall like Deadpool. In the scene, Deadpool wears a bath robe and tells the audience to go home. He also confirms that Cable will appear in the sequel. After reading the scene, a Fox executive described the film as [...] "Ferris Bueller's Day Off meets Natural Born Killers", which the writers felt was an accurate description.|$|E
500|$|Mario Bros. {{was created}} by Shigeru Miyamoto and Gunpei Yokoi, two of the lead {{developers}} for the video game Donkey Kong. In Donkey Kong, Mario dies if he falls too far. Yokoi suggested to Miyamoto {{that he should be}} able to fall from any height, which Miyamoto was not sure of, thinking that it would make it [...] "not much of a game." [...] He eventually agreed, thinking it would be <b>okay</b> <b>for</b> him to have some superhuman abilities. He designed a prototype that had Mario [...] "jumping and bouncing around", which he was satisfied with. The element of combating enemies from below was introduced after Yokoi suggested it, observing that it would work since there were multiple floors. However, it proved to be too easy to eliminate enemies this way, which the developers fixed by requiring players to touch the enemies after they've been flipped to defeat them. This was also how they introduced the turtle as an enemy, which they conceived as an enemy that could only be hit from below. Because of Mario's appearance in Donkey Kong with overalls, a hat, and a thick moustache, Shigeru Miyamoto thought that he should be a plumber as opposed to a carpenter, and designed this game to reflect that. Another contributing factor was the game's setting: it was a large network of giant pipes, so they felt a change in occupation was necessary for him.|$|E

[...] James Steyer of Common Sense Media also criticized the decision, citing that [...] "If parents decide a violent game is <b>okay</b> <b>for</b> their kid, that's one thing, but millions of kids are not able to judge the impact of ultra-violence on their own." [...] Andy Schlafly, who had submitted a brief to the court on behalf of the Eagle Forum and Legal Defense Fund, heavily criticized the majority opinion, believing that [...] "the court's latest disregard of parental rights is on a crash course with technological advances." [...] Tim Winter of the Parents Television Council asserted that the Court's decision [...] "replaces the authority of parents with the economic interests of the video game industry." [...] The Washington Post opined that the California law [...] "did nothing to infringe on the rights of adults" [...] while dealing with [...] "reasonable limitations on minors’ access to extremely violent games that even the video game industry acknowledges are inappropriate," [...] and that with the high bar for any future legislation, the onus is on the video game industry to maintain its self-policing of video game sales.|$|E
