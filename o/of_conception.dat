Studies <b>of</b> <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> ability are reviewed. 11 {{is argued that}} <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> ability are not domain-specific, but are formulated by adapting goal-directed categories (e. g., causes-performances-outcomes) to achievement-related situations.

5|$|Female {{cats are}} {{seasonally}} polyestrous, {{which means they}} may have many periods of heat {{over the course of}} a year, the season beginning in spring and ending in late autumn. Heat periods occur about every two weeks and last about 4 to 7 days. Multiple males will be attracted to a female in heat. The males will fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. At first, the female rejects the male, but eventually the female allows the male to mate. The female utters a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her because a male cat's penis has a band of about 120–150 backwards-pointing penile spines, which are about 1mm long; upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which acts to induce ovulation. This act also occurs to clear the vagina of other sperm in the context of a second (or more) mating, thus giving the later males a larger chance <b>of</b> <b>conception.</b>|$|E
5|$|Matings are {{generally}} observed between March and May, {{but the most}} likely time <b>of</b> <b>conception</b> is April. Most mating {{takes place in the}} territories and during the day. Females have control over the copulation process, and males may have to keep mating with the same females. Females usually give birth to one young each year. Gestation lasts around 27 weeks, and pregnant females give birth between late September and November. Late births into January are sometimes observed. The altricial newborns rely on their mothers for warmth. For their first three weeks, young cling to their mothers when they go foraging. After this, the young remain in the roosts. By January, young are capable of sustained flight, and by February, March or April are fully weaned.|$|E
5|$|Burne-Jones {{was elected}} an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1885, and the {{following}} year he exhibited (for the only time) at the Academy, showing The Depths of the Sea, {{a painting of a}} mermaid carrying down with her a youth whom she has unconsciously drowned in the impetuosity of her love. This picture adds to the habitual haunting charm a tragic irony <b>of</b> <b>conception</b> and a felicity of execution which give it a place apart among Burne-Jones's works. He formally resigned his Associateship in 1893. One of the Perseus series was exhibited in 1887, two more in 1888, with The Brazen Tower, inspired by the same legend. In 1890 the second series of The Legend of Briar Rose were exhibited by themselves, and won the widest admiration. The huge watercolor, The Star of Bethlehem, painted for the corporation of Birmingham, was exhibited in 1891. A long illness for some time checked the painter's activity, which, when resumed, was much occupied with decorative schemes. An exhibition of his work was held at the New Gallery in the winter of 1892-1893. To this period belong several of his comparatively few portraits. In 1894 Burne-Jones was made a baronet. Ill-health again interrupted the progress of his works, chief among which was the vast Arthur in Avalon. In the winter following his death a second exhibition of his works was held at the New Gallery, and an exhibition of his drawings (including some of the charmingly humorous sketches made for children) at the Burlington Fine Arts Club.|$|E

Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), and Gabe all visit Angela at the hospital. According to Angela, {{the baby was}} born prematurely, but due to the size, Oscar deduces that Angela lied about the date <b>of</b> <b>conception.</b> Angela admits that the baby was {{conceived}} a month before her wedding, and makes them promise not to tell anyone. Suspecting that Dwight is the real father, Oscar breaks his promise and tells him when he arrives at the hospital in search of Gabe. Dwight barges in on Angela and her husband and begins thoroughly examining the child. When the senator leaves, Dwight confronts Angela about the child, claiming that it is his. She refutes his claim, but Dwight leaves satisfied, telling the attending nurse to call off the baby's circumcision, which the nonplussed nurse refuses to do. Upon returning to Dunder Mifflin he drops his dispute with Jim, since his self-assumed fatherhood has given him a new appreciation for the duties of parenthood. The episode ends with Dwight putting a decal on his car, in honor of his covert new family member.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> {{teaching}} and learning held by {{a small group of}} students completing a one year course in secondary teacher education at the Christchurch College of Education. Seven students were interviewed, observed and surveyed over a period of eight months, to track the development in their conceptions and the factors impacting on this development. The phenomenographic interview formed the primary means <b>of</b> data collection. <b>Conceptions</b> emerging from the data were categorised in terms of their fundamental differences. Findings are presented in two parts. Firstly a profile of each student is constructed from the data gathered; each profile concludes with a brief authorial comment. Secondly, <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> {{teaching and learning}} are categorised and compared with existing categories <b>of</b> <b>conceptions.</b> While the students' <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> learning are found to correspond closely to existing categories, different categories <b>of</b> <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> teaching have been identified. A model <b>of</b> <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> teaching is presented in which the categories are considered to be complementary rather than hierarchical. This thesis suggests that there is a close link between students' <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> learning and their approaches to teaching; that prior educational experiences, especially the influence of significant teachers, has a strong and lasting impact on students' ideas about teaching and learning; that these ideas undergo modification rather than substantial change as a result of pre-service teacher education; that time constraints and the teaching approaches of some associate teachers in schools may encourage students to adopt teaching methods which encourage surface approaches to learning in their pupils; and that effective teaching should draw on all three categories <b>of</b> <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> teaching presented in the model...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> {{evolution is}} a problem of both great practical concern and important theoretical interest. Many Americans do not understand basic principles of evolution, such as natural selection, and part of the reason may be that these concepts are notoriously difficult to learn and to teach. The four contributions in this special issue all investigate the development <b>of</b> <b>conceptions</b> in evolution. Several of the articles focus on the interaction between children’s prior beliefs and their interpretation and cognitive construction of evolutionary concepts. For example, essentialist beliefs (e. g., Gelman, 2003) may affect how children understand and interpret natural selection and the evolution of species. The four articles all demonstrate that prior beliefs constrain and influence how children and adults interpret what they observe and are taught about evolution. Taken together, the articles demonstrate the importance of taking a developmental approach to understanding the development <b>of</b> <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> evolution...|$|R
40|$|<b>Conceptions</b> <b>of</b> {{learning}} and teaching shape teaching practices and are, therefore, important to understanding how engineering professors learn to teach. There is abundant research about professors 2 ̆ 7 <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> teaching; however, research on the <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> teaching of doctoral students, the future professors, is scarce. Furthermore, {{there is a need}} to understand not just future engineering professors 2 ̆ 7 <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> teaching but also their <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> learning. The purpose of this study was to explore qualitative variations in future engineering professors 2 ̆ 7 <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> {{learning and}} teaching as well as understanding how they came to these conceptions. The research questions that guided this qualitative study are the following: 1) How do future engineering professors describe their <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> learning engineering?, 2) How do future engineering professors describe the basis <b>of</b> their <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> learning engineering?, 3) How do future engineering professors describe their <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> teaching engineering?, and 4) How do future engineering professors describe the basis <b>of</b> their <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> teaching engineering? Twenty doctoral engineering students interested in academic careers were interviewed. A phenomenographic approach was used to explore variations in <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> {{learning and teaching}}. The basis <b>of</b> <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> learning and teaching were explored using thematic analysis. Six variations in future engineering professors 2 ̆ 7 <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> learning engineering emerged and included learning engineering as 1) acquiring knowledge, 2) gaining an understanding, 3) practicing problem solving, 4) applying knowledge, 5) developing an approach, and 6) maturing. Each <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> learning was described by seven dimensions or features: focus, nature of knowledge, view of engineering, strategies, assessments, interactions, and relational. Participants described the basis for their <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> learning engineering through four general themes: undergraduate student experience, research, graduate school experience, and prior teaching experiences. Five categories <b>of</b> <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> teaching engineering emerged and included teaching engineering as 1) delivering knowledge, 2) helping understand and apply concepts, 3) motivating students, 4) helping students learn how to approach problems, and 5) preparing students to make socially conscious decisions. In describing <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> teaching, five dimensions were identified: focus, strategies, use of students 2 ̆ 7 prior knowledge, faculty-student interaction, <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> learning, and projects. Observing professors, student experience, talking about teaching, and teaching experience were described by participants as the basis for their <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> teaching engineering. The findings of this study are consistent with previous categorizations of university professors 2 ̆ 7 <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> teaching from teacher-centered/content-oriented to student-centered/learning-oriented. However, this study contributes to the literature of engineering education and faculty development by contextualizing the <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> learning and teaching of future engineering professors. Furthermore, this study provides richer descriptions of variations in other aspects of teaching and learning engineering such as future professors 2 ̆ 7 views on student interactions, student development, assessment, motivation, problem solving, assumptions about knowledge, teaching and learning strategies. In addition, this study contributes to our understanding of how professors learn about teaching. In particular, the exploration of the basis for the <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> learning and teaching opens new avenues to explore how <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> teaching and learning evolve over time.
