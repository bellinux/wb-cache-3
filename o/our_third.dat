500|$|At {{two minutes}} and twenty seconds long, [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] {{was written in the}} key of C major at a tempo of 100 beats per minute. Performed [...] "freely" [...] in the style of a mellow, 1950s girl group song, the ballad {{features}} Egan's [...] "sultry" [...] vocals. Adhering to [...] "the R motif" [...] Menken employs throughout the entire soundtrack, the pop song incorporates doo-wop. Featuring [...] "cooing shooby-doos and sha-la-las" [...] by the Muses, who perform [...] "gospel-tinged" [...] back up vocals and riffs on the track, Jeffrey Gantz of the Boston Phoenix compared Egan's [...] "soaring" [...] vocals girl group The Ronettes. Describing [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] as [...] "a traditional Disney [...] lament," [...] Vulture.com's Lindsey Weber acknowledged its [...] "unique Motown edge", comparing the Muses to The Supremes. Musically, Irving Tan of Sputnikmusic described the teen pop-influenced [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] as [...] "the closest the Herculean villa ever comes to approximating a Broadway show". Combined, Egan and the Muses' vocals span two octaves, from G3 to C5. Egan's vocal performance is more restrained than those of the actresses who voice Ariel from The Little Mermaid (1989) and Belle from Beauty and the Beast (1991). Chelsea Fagan of Thought Catalog described Egan's voice as [...] "sarcastic" [...] and [...] "smoky", while Billboards Taylor Weatherby called it [...] "soulfully belt".Lyrically, [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love) is a love song about denial, specifically one's reluctance to fall in love or admit to romantic clichés. Meg voices how cliché and insufficient love can feel. Parodying [...] "classic" [...] love songs, [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] differs in style from love songs usually associated with Disney films by offering [...] "a unique spin". Rob Burch of The Hollywood News dubbed [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] an [...] "anti-love song". Described as an [...] "emotional barnstormer", the song begins with Egan singing the lyrics [...] "If there's a prize for rotten judgment I guess I've already won that", which is soon followed by [...] "Been there, done that". Thought Catalogs Chelsea Fagan believes that the first verse [...] "sums up in four lines everything that we’ve ever tried to convey while on <b>our</b> <b>third</b> drink out at the bar with the girls", joking, [...] "I believe this song would come shortly after dancing in a circle with all women, but just before the tearful texting of your ex".|$|E

Actually, I did an {{interview}} {{about a year ago}} with a newspaper from America and they talked about how much it's been used in sports in America… which I didn't know so much about. Apparently it has been used a lot and it was nice to hear. The ironic thing, though, is that the song was actually written for the fans. It was over six minutes long and was never meant to be a hit or anything like that. It was meant to be an opening for the 'live' show. We were putting out <b>our</b> <b>third</b> album and we wanted a really 'grand' opening for the show. So, I had that 'riff' tucked away in a drawer since my college years and I took it out, found a tempo for it, wrote lyrics, {{and it turned out to}} be a great opening for that album and for the show, as well. Nowadays, we don't rehearse it, but when we play it live, it is still just so amazing! It does communicate so well with the audience and we really love playing it." ...|$|E

What I said during the referendum campaign is I want my country back. What I'm saying today is I want my life back. And it begins right now" [...] and [...] "I have never been, and I have never wanted to be, a career politician." [...] Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, described Farage as a [...] "retro-nationalist", Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, said that his legacy is [...] "toxic and unforgivable" [...] and that [...] "He has used his position to whip up hatred against migrants and divert attention from the real challenges this country is facing", and former Labour Party leader, Ed Miliband, said: [...] "It's a legacy of stirring up division. I am not sorry to see Nigel Farage leave the political scene". However, Paul Nuttall, a UKIP MEP, tweeted that Farage's [...] "drive and belief shook establishment politics to its core and gave us a voice" [...] and Suzanne Evans, former Deputy Chairman of UKIP, said that Farage's resignation surprised her, but [...] "there is room still in Britain for UKIP". Writing in The Spectator, after this resignation when it was thought he was leaving politics, the journalist Rod Liddle described Farage as: [...] "The most important British politician of the last decade and the most successful. His resignation leaves a hole in our political system. With enormous intelligence and chutzpah and a refreshingly unorthodox approach, he built UKIP up from nothing to become established as <b>our</b> <b>third</b> largest party and succeeded in his overriding ambition – to see the UK vote to leave the European Union." ...|$|E
