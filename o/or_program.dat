5|$|In {{addition}} to the armed conflict, there are other explanations for this situation: Municipalities tend to use their financial resources from the Sistema General de Participaciones or General Participation System (Law 715 of 2001) mainly in urban areas. Furthermore, there is no institution <b>or</b> <b>program</b> {{at the national level}} which offers technical assistance to the 12,000 rural community organizations. Law 142 of 1994 assigns that task to the departments, but these have not carried out the task in a satisfactory way so far.|$|E
5|$|The Leopard 2E or Leopard 2A6E (E {{stands for}} España, Spanish for Spain) is {{a variant of}} the German Leopard 2 main battle tank, {{tailored}} to the requirements of the Spanish army, which acquired it as part of an armament modernization program named Programa Coraza, <b>or</b> <b>Program</b> Breastplate. The acquisition program for the Leopard2E began in 1994, five years after the cancellation of the Lince tank program that culminated in an agreement to transfer 108 Leopard 2A4s to the Spanish army in 1998 and started the local production of the Leopard 2E in December 2003. Despite postponement of production owing to the 2003 merger between Santa Bárbara Sistemas and General Dynamics, and continued fabrication issues between 2006 and 2007, 219 Leopard2Es have been delivered to the Spanish army.|$|E

25|$|After an {{extensive}} situation analysis, a project <b>or</b> <b>program</b> is developed.

Goals are also created during this step in order to analyze the program's effectiveness in a human rights context {{at the end of}} the project. Finally, NGOs encourage control over the project by the affected peoples, utilizing the Right to Participate principle.|$|E

25|$|NAND {{relies on}} ECC to {{compensate}} for bits that may spontaneously fail during normal device operation. A typical ECC will correct a one-bit error in each 2048bits (256bytes) using 22bits of ECC, or a one-bit error in each 4096bits (512bytes) using 24bits of ECC. If the ECC cannot correct the error during read, it may still detect the error. When doing erase <b>or</b> <b>program</b> operations, the device can detect blocks that fail to program or erase and mark them bad. The data is then written to a different, good block, and the bad block map is updated.|$|E

Starz broadcasts its primary and multiplex channels on Eastern and Pacific Time Zone schedules. The respective coastal feeds of each channel are usually packaged together (though most cable providers only offer the east and west coast feeds of the main Starz channel), resulting in the difference in local airtimes for a particular movie <b>or</b> <b>program</b> between two geographic locations being three hours at most.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, XM Satellite Radio was sued by the RIAA over XM's new {{portable}} devices the Inno and Helix. The RIAA claims these devices are {{equivalent to a}} downloading service, whereas XM contends the devices are protected under the 1992 Audio Home Recording Act. In July, XM requested that a federal judge dismiss the case. It {{should be noted that}} XM's subscribers can save only songs they hear on the radio and cannot request a specific song to be downloaded <b>or</b> <b>program</b> their radios to record specific artists. XM's {{portable devices}} allow the consumer to record a portion of their broadcast much like a VCR, DVR, or cassette player would allow. The content a subscriber records is available only while the subscriber still has an active account with XM Satellite Radio. Once the account is terminated, the recorded content will become inaccessible. Also, If a subscriber fails to listen to a total of 8 hours of programming a month, the recorded content will not be accessible. Recorded content can be accessed only on the portable device; it cannot be transferred to a home computer or separate digital music player.|$|E
25|$|The {{period between}} the fall of Magloire and the {{election}} of Duvalier in September 1957 was a chaotic one, even by Haitian standards. Three provisional presidents held office during this interval; one resigned and the army deposed the other two, Franck Sylvain and Fignolé. Duvalier {{is said to have}} engaged actively in the behind-the-scenes intrigue that helped him to emerge as the presidential candidate that the military favored. The military went on to guide the campaign and the elections in a way that gave Duvalier every possible advantage. Most political actors perceived Duvalier—a medical doctor who had served as a rural administrator of a United States-funded anti-yaws campaign before entering the cabinet under Estimé—as an honest and fairly unassuming leader without a strong ideological motivation <b>or</b> <b>program.</b> When elections were finally organized, this time under terms of universal suffrage (both men and women now had the vote), Duvalier, a black, painted himself as the legitimate heir to Estimé. This approach was enhanced by the fact that Duvalier's only viable opponent, Louis Déjoie, was a mulatto and the scion of a prominent family. Duvalier scored a decisive victory at the polls. His followers took two-thirds of the legislature's lower house and all of the seats in the Senate.|$|E
