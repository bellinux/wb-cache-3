25|$|The {{practice}} of irrigation {{has a long}} history in wine production. Archaeologists describe it as one of the oldest practices in viticulture, with irrigation canals discovered near vineyard sites in Armenia and Egypt dating back more than 2600 years. Irrigation was already widely practiced for <b>other</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>crops</b> since around 5000 BC. It is possible that the knowledge of irrigation helped viticulture spread from these areas to other regions, due to the potential for the grapevine to grow in soils too infertile to support other food crops. A somewhat robust plant, the grapevine's largest need is for sufficient sunshine, and it is able to flourish with minimum needs of water and nutrients. In areas where its water needs are unfulfilled, the availability of irrigation meant that viticulture could still be supported.|$|E
25|$|The first {{vineyard}} {{planted in}} the Okanagan was at the Oblate Mission in Kelowna in 1859, planted by French Catholic priest Charles Pandosy and was solely intended {{for the production of}} sacramental wine for the celebration of the Eucharist. Several small vineyards, planted mostly with Vitis labrusca sprang up until prohibition encouraged the uprooting and replanting with <b>other</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>crops.</b> For most of the 20th century after prohibition, what limited wine production {{that took place in the}} Okanagan was mostly fruit wines made from berries, apples, cherries or even table grapes. One winery, Calona Wines founded in 1932, still remains from that period and was the first commercial winery in British Columbia and remains the oldest continuously running winery in the province. Eventually the use of French-American hybrid grapes, such as Marechal Foch and Vidal blanc took hold, led by the Stewarts of Quails' Gate Estate Winery.|$|E

Coffee and tapioca was quickly abandoned in the 1890s when the value of these crops experienced a drop, while rubber was introduced and quickly established a strong foothold in Johor, as the world demand for rubber increased greatly around 1910. Prices for gambier plunged between 1905 and 1906, and many Kangchu abandoned gambier in favour of rubber. Further {{decline in the number of}} gambier and pepper plantations was fuelled by the colonial government's suppression of traditional farming methods employed by the Kangchu for planting gambier and pepper; these method led to soil exhaustion and a depletion of forests which was used as firewood in small factories. A few years before the Kangchu system was abolished, exports for both gambier and pepper plunged by a further 60% between 1912 and 1917.|$|E

40|$|Process of {{transition}} movements in Republic of Sebia is in progress. Transition movements have not bypassed agrarian sector. Market agriculture should gain significance along this process. On this occasion {{we would like}} to emphasis two elements which affect development of Market Agriculture. Those are regionalization and specialization of agriculture. In study about agrarian regions in conditions {{of transition}} two charts are given, that pinpoint the essence of natural foundation and market opportunities in transition circumstances. Study of agro-identities starts with introspection of each reagion in respect of its natural values: plain (Vojvodina), hilly (Sumadija), mountain-hilly (Pester). Therefore, plain region is specialized for production of stable livestocking (cattle and hogs), mountain-hilly is based on pasture (sheep and cattle) etc. Regional disposition of some types of livestocking is limited by natural conditions and structure of agricultural area. Essentially, the level of livestock farming has been determined by economic progress of the region and Market development. The certain other regions are specialized in viticulture, fruit-growing or vegetable growing (vicinity of big cities). In time of transition, i. e. transferring to Market Agriculture, issue of regional identity has become more actual than ever. This could be best illustrated on the example of forming specialized cooperatives, agricultural markets and companies (plum and apple production and <b>other</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>cropping)</b> spread throughout particular areas of Serbia.

30|$|Hoppe et al. [4] {{state that}} keeping the colonies in {{woodland}} sites “without intensive agricultural crops” {{does not reflect}} normal beekeeping practice. However, {{for the purpose of}} investigating whether systemic residues in pollen and nectar from flowering crops seed treated with thiamethoxam present any risk to honeybee colonies, it is absolutely necessary to isolate the experiment from any other confounding pesticide inputs during the post flowering period. For this reason, the post flowering sites had to be located away from <b>other</b> <b>agricultural</b> fields. In fact, if the colonies had been located close to <b>other</b> bee attractive <b>agricultural</b> <b>crops</b> (as may occur in beekeeping) the results could be challenged based on dilution of residues. Latitude and longitude coordinates of the over-wintering sites were not included in Pilling et al. [3] for reasons of brevity but are available in raw data. Field surveys were also carried out prior to selection of over-wintering sites.|$|R

In Lushoto and Korogwe districts, it focused in particular on the domestic vegetable value chain (VVC), where rates of women’s participation are lower as compared to <b>other</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>crop</b> production. In 2015 – 17, the project ‘Balancing unpaid care work and paid work: successes, challenges and lessons for women’s economic empowerment programmes and policies’ investigated how women’s economic empowerment (WEE) policies and programmes take unpaid care work into account, in order to enable women’s economic empowerment to be optimised. How does access to decent work play a key role in enabling women to achieve a ‘double boon’ through their participation in economically empowering work? This note discusses the main findings of the research in relation to the care-sensitivity of the Oxfam programme. It offers recommendations to Oxfam on how unpaid care work can be mainstreamed into its WEE programming, particularly by: helping to set up and maintain women’s groups to enable collective action; sharing its knowledge and experience to support other organisations in this kind of work; helping women lobby for increased access to markets; enabling women to campaign for better public services and infrastructure; helping families plan and redistribute the division of care tasks of household members; and encouraging families to send their children to school, discouraging the transfer of onerous care tasks that disrupt schooling.

25|$|The {{biological}} production of hydrogen fuel {{has been a}} topic of research {{since at least the}} 1970s. Hydrogen gas can be produced from biomass sources like agricultural and forest residues, consumer waste and <b>other</b> specific <b>agricultural</b> <b>crops.</b> Specifically, hydrogen fuel is produced by a process called gasification, where biomass is processed into a combustible gas and then burned, or by pyrolysis, a related process which can lead to hydrogen gas suitable for fuel-cell applications. One continuing subject of research regards the production of unwanted co-products in both of these processes. The presence of other contaminant gases often depend on specific composition of the biomass source, which can be difficult to control. Another source for {{biological production}} of hydrogen fuel is algae. In the late 1990s it was discovered that if algae are deprived of sulfur they will switch from the production of oxygen, as in normal photosynthesis, to the production of hydrogen. Experimental algae farms are attempting to make algae an economically feasible energy source.|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} marketing {{status of}} fish fingerlings has been analysed {{with a special}} reference to environmental concerns and awareness of the fishermen. The constraints have been identified and suggestions have been made {{for the development of}} marketing of fishery on the basis of primary data collected from Dakshin Dinajpur district of West Bengal in 2006. Small and marginal farmers dominate the fishery and about 10 per cent of fish farmers earn their major livelihood from fishing. Three to four middlemen have been noted in the existing four marketing channels. Insignificant price variation among the channels has been confirmed by low value (7. 25 per cent) of co-efficient of variation (CV). The fisherman’s share to consumer price {{has been found to be}} 62. 80 per cent which is higher than any <b>other</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>crop.</b> The average elasticity of demand has been found to be one (approx.). Infrastructural facilities are lacking. However, judging from the modest profits of middlemen and their reasonable marketing margins, fish market appears to be competitive and relatively efficient in the study area. The pollutants in aquatic environment are diverse and complex in nature. The main sources of pollution are pesticides and leaching of dissolved chemical fertilizers, sewage and waste disposal, retting of fibre-crops, processing wastes, etc. It has been found that degree of consciousness about the environmental-related consequences on fish production and marketing is highly limited. Market survey has shown that production of small local catch fishes has a declining trend. The study has found that over-fishing and lack of production culture are the main reasons for this decline. The study has suggested that a collective effort should be initiated for eco-friendly and sustainable fish conservation, production and marketing with the existing resources, socio-economic and environmental constraints, which, in turn, will upgrade the economic status and quality of lives of the fishers in the district.
