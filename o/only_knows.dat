However, Holo-Pearl <b>only</b> <b>knows</b> how to sword fight, seeing everything as a potential opponent. Garnet and Amethyst urge Steven to stop using it and wait for the real Pearl to come back. After Holo-Pearl cuts down the real Pearl's favorite tree, Steven becomes infuriated and tries to drive Holo-Pearl away.|$|E
5|$|After Brian reveals Meg's {{secret to}} Peter and Lois, who don't want her seeing Luke again, he soon breaks {{out of jail}} during a prison riot and tries {{to hide in the}} Griffins' house. When Brian comes to Meg's room to {{apologize}} for what he did to her, he finds him just as Peter enters. Peter <b>only</b> <b>knows</b> what is happening when reading the episode's plot synopsis in TV Guide (the reason he entered the rodeo), and finds out who Luke is. As Luke escapes out the window, Peter alerts Joe, who apprehends Luke. Joe also arrests Meg for harboring a fugitive, and she is sent to prison. Luke is never heard from again in the episode.|$|E

5|$|The arms contain tension sensors so the octopus {{knows whether}} its arms are {{stretched}} out, {{but this is}} not sufficient for the brain to determine the position of the octopus's body or arms. As a result, the octopus does not possess stereognosis; that is, it does not form a mental image of the overall shape of the object it is handling. It can detect local texture variations, but cannot integrate the information into a larger picture. The neurological autonomy of the arms means the octopus has great difficulty learning about the detailed effects of its motions. It has a poor proprioceptive sense, and it <b>only</b> <b>knows</b> what exact motions were made by observing the arms visually.|$|E
5|$|The sheriff {{finds the}} wolf in the woods, {{and when he}} whistles, the wolf goes to him. As he pets the wolf's head, he sees himself holding a knife, about to hurt the woman he <b>only</b> <b>knows</b> as Mary Margaret. Graham pays a visit to her classroom, telling her that he {{believes}} they know each other from another life, before Storybrooke. Mary Margaret assumes that the sheriff has been talking to Henry, and while {{this is not the}} case, this gives Graham the idea to consult Henry about his book. Meanwhile, at the sheriff's office, Regina shows up and warns Emma to stay away from Graham, apparently jealous of his connection with Emma.|$|E
5|$|Father John Buerlein (Jeremy Sisto) is the mild-mannered Catholic {{priest of}} a small parish in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Overworked and underpaid, he has grown jaded with the {{profession}} and has trouble connecting with his parishioners. During confession, a mysterious and unnamed prostitute (Kristin Chenoweth) confesses to a sin she has not yet committed: she plans to commit suicide on her birthday. Father John is taken aback. The confession ends abruptly, and {{he is unable to}} stop the woman before she disappears. He <b>only</b> <b>knows</b> she wears a crucifix and is an Aries, which means her birthday is soon. Father John grows obsessed with finding and helping this woman, and begins visiting the city's red-light district with the hopes of finding her. On his way home, Father John meets a homeless man named Gus (Gene Larche), but with no money for him, he gives him a rosary instead. Later, he seeks counsel from his friend Father Ralph O'Brien (Brian Baumgartner), who advises him not to become too personally involved.|$|E

500|$|... "Say Hello to My Little Friend" [...] {{continued}} and introduced key thematic elements {{to the series}} that were originally introduced in [...] "The Little Guy". Key themes in this installment included when Michael was unable to see Rex and realized that Hawkins {{was trying to kill}} him in the car crash. It was described as a [...] "show about grief" [...] when it first started airing and that the [...] "cause of the car crash didn't really matter" [...] at that time. Now, however, The A.V. Club noted that Awake is [...] "dabbling in crooked cops and God <b>only</b> <b>knows</b> what else". He observed that Michael could be having another defense to keep the fantasy world alive because of his thoughts with Hawkins.|$|E
500|$|Anne's {{stepmother}} {{gave birth}} to a son, James Francis Edward, on 10 June 1688, and a Catholic succession became more likely. Anne was still at Bath, so she did not witness the birth, which fed the belief that the child was spurious. Anne may have left the capital deliberately to avoid being present, or because she was genuinely ill, but {{it is also possible that}} James desired the exclusion of all Protestants, including his daughter, from affairs of state. [...] "I shall never now be satisfied", Anne wrote to her sister Mary, [...] "whether the child be true or false. It may be it is our brother, but God <b>only</b> <b>knows...</b> one cannot help having a thousand fears and melancholy thoughts, but whatever changes may happen you shall ever find me firm to my religion and faithfully yours." ...|$|E
500|$|The Association {{had turned}} to the Scott Stamp and Coin Company of New York to market the coins. [...] Scott was able to sell some of the 1928 half dollars. These actions have been {{interpreted}} negatively by numismatic scholars: Q. David Bowers alleges that Scott's representative, Wayte Raymond, proposed melting most of the issue to create an artificial scarcity, and that the company [...] "desired {{to capitalize on the}} gullibility of collectors and their need to complete sets by having more varieties coined. Scott figured that if additional Oregon Trail half dollars could be minted with the date 1933 they could be sold effectively at the Century of Progress Exposition held that year in Chicago." [...] Swiatek and Breen noted, [...] "through God <b>only</b> <b>knows</b> what manner of political manipulation, the Oregon Trail Memorial Association managed to obtain approval of a new 1933 Denver issue" [...] for sale at the exposition.|$|E

500|$|In {{the years}} after the 1906 election, Shaw felt that the Fabians needed fresh leadership, and saw this {{in the form of}} his fellow-writer H. G. Wells, who had joined the society in February 1903. Wells's ideas for reform—particularly his {{proposals}} for closer cooperation with the Independent Labour Party—placed him at odds with the society's [...] "Old Gang", led by Shaw. According to Cole, Wells [...] "had minimal capacity for putting [...] across in public meetings against Shaw's trained and practised virtuosity". In Shaw's view, [...] "the Old Gang did not extinguish Mr Wells, he annihilated himself". Wells resigned from the society in September 1908; Shaw remained a member, but left the executive in April 1911. He later wondered whether the Old Gang should have given way to Wells some years earlier: [...] "God <b>only</b> <b>knows</b> whether the Society had not better have done it". Although less active—he blamed his advancing years—Shaw remained a Fabian.|$|E
500|$|Julien et Marie: Marie makes {{herself at}} home, trying on the clothes of Julien's old girlfriend, {{exploring}} the house, and watching him at work. Their lovemaking is passionate, but Marie's behaviour is unusual. She is sometimes cold or trance-like, {{at one point}} reciting words in an unidentified language, and she is physically detached and unaware of the time — Julien corrects her [...] "" [...] to [...] "". She is jealous of his ex, compulsively decorates and rearranges a room in his attic, feels compelled to act out her dreams, and does not bleed when scratched — something she keeps from Julien. She sees a girl in her dreams who shows her a [...] "forbidden sign" [...] with her hands. Marie helps Julien in his blackmailing, and after meeting Madame X, who <b>only</b> <b>knows</b> of Marie as [...] "l'autre personne", Marie is handed a letter by someone who says she is Madame X's sister (Bettina Kee); she is the girl Marie dreamed of before.|$|E
500|$|Further delays on the Creek Turnpike project {{appeared}} {{inevitable in}} October 1990, {{as a new}} area meeting the federal definition of a wetland was discovered {{in the path of}} the turnpike. OTA officials did not bring the area to USACE's attention because they did not believe it met the criteria to be considered a wetland. Frustration mounted after the find; rumors surfaced that OTA was considering canceling the Creek Turnpike and shifting the remaining funds to turnpike projects in the Oklahoma City area. In an interview after an OTA meeting, chairman John Kilpatrick was quoted as saying [...] "God <b>only</b> <b>knows</b> when [...] be completed," [...] describing the project as a [...] "total disaster" [...] and commenting [...] "If we had it all to do over again, we wouldn't do that project." [...] OTA was concerned about the financial impact of USACE's delay in issuing the required permits; each day after the planned opening date that the project ran late added $20,000 (approximately $ in [...] dollars) to the total cost of the project. USACE finally issued the permit on November 15, over a year after OTA applied for it.|$|E
