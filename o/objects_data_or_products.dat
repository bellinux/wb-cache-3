50|$|Garbage, in {{the context}} of {{computer}} science, refers to <b>objects,</b> <b>data,</b> <b>or</b> other regions of the memory of a computer system (or other system resources), which will not be used in any future computation by the system, or by a program running on it. As computer systems all have finite amounts of memory, it is frequently necessary to deallocate garbage and return it to the heap, or memory pool, so the underlying memory can be reused.|$|R

40|$|This report {{analyzes}} the reference behaviour of IBM DB 2 running an On-line Transaction Processing benchmark TPC-C. Reference behaviour for different tables and different <b>object</b> types (<b>data</b> <b>or</b> index) is studied. The {{effect of the}} number of users is also examined. It is found that the correlated references exist in most tables. The period of correlated references is affected by the type of references to tables, type of <b>objects</b> (<b>data</b> <b>or</b> index), and number of users. It is also found that different tables exhibit different reference behaviour, which depends on how it is accessed by the applications. The data pages and index pages also exhibit different reference behaviour. The index pages of all tables have similar locality. Based on the reference behaviour of different tables and the data/index pages, the buffer pool can be effectively partitioned to group pages with similar properties into one partition. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To capture gravity domain {{expertise}} {{through an}} ontology and to generate high-level workflows from the ontology that are understandable by scientists. Description: Workflow-driven ontologies (WDOs) (Salcedo, 2006; Salayandia et al., 2006 a) are ontologies that capture knowledge from domain experts as concepts categorized as information (<b>data</b> <b>or</b> <b>products)</b> and methods (i. e, services, process-es, or functions) {{as well as}} relationships among these concepts. A WDO extends a traditional ontology with process knowledge and, more importantly, {{it is one that}} supports composition of software applications that conciliate the needs of domain and computer scientists through the specification of scientific work-flows. Productive design of scientific workflows often depends on the effectiveness of the communication between the domain experts and technology experts, including their ability to share their specific needs i...|$|R

Based on this, the paper proposed a model of perceived influence of academic performance using social networking.

The study confirmed that majority of students agreed the social networking media have positive influence on their academic performance.

40|$|We survey three {{examples}} of large-scale scientific workflows {{that we are}} working with at Cornell: the Arecibo sky survey, the CLEO high-energy particle physics experiment, and the Web Lab project for enabling social science studies of the Internet. All three projects face the same general challenges: massive amounts of raw data, expensive processing steps, and the requirement to make raw <b>data</b> <b>or</b> <b>data</b> <b>products</b> available to users nation- or world-wide. However, there are several differences that prevent a one-sizefits-all approach to handling their data flows. Instead, current implementations are heavily tuned by domain and data management experts.

40|$|The Distance-based Content Routing (DCR) {{protocol}} is introduced, {{which enables}} routers to maintain multiple loop-free routes {{to the nearest}} instances of a named <b>data</b> <b>object</b> <b>or</b> name prex in an information centric network (ICN), and establish content delivery trees over which all or some instances of the same named <b>data</b> <b>object</b> <b>or</b> name prex can be contacted. In contrast to all prior routing solutions for ICNs, DCR operates without requiring routers to establish overlays, knowing the network topology, using complete paths to content replicas, or knowing about all the sites storing replicas of named content. It is shown that DCR is correct and that is orders of magnitude more scalable than recent name-based routing approaches for ICNs, {{in terms of the}} time and signaling overhead needed to obtain correct routing to named content...|$|R

The approach is unique in that it determines a set of corrections for power, gain, pulse length, and an angle dependent calibration term relative to a single Reson 7125 MBES calibrated in an acoustic test tank. These corrections for each MBES can then be applied during processing for any acquisition setting combination.
