We just had a chance for camaraderie, singer-to-singer, artist-to-artist, that kind <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>We</b> just laughed and talked and laughed and talked and sang in between that ... It's {{good to know that}} two ladies of soul can still be friends. We talked about doing other things together, enterprise-wise, which is cool, because she's got a good, vivid mind, that girl. She's a smart lady. I really like Mariah.|$|E

We knew the constitution was not perfect; {{it had to}} be a compromise with all the faults of a compromise... But, in spite of the unforeseen [...] strains and stresses, the constitution has worked, on the whole, much as we thought it would. I think it now needs revision, to meet the needs of a changed world. But no-one could wish the work undone, who tries to imagine, what, in these stormy days, would have been the plight of six disunited Australian colonies." ...|$|E
500|$|The band Them {{was signed}} by Phil Solomon, who {{contracted}} producer Bert Berns {{to work with the}} group, and Phil Coulter came on as a musical arranger and lyricist. The group became popular with songs including [...] "Baby Please Don't Go", [...] "Gloria", and [...] "Here Comes the Night". Morrison commented of Them: [...] "Them were never meant to be on Top of the Pops. I mean, miming? lip syncing? We used to laugh at that programme, think it was a joke. Then we were on it ourselves. It was ridiculous. We were totally anti that sort <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>We</b> were really into the blues... and we had to get into suits and have make-up put on and all that shit." ...|$|E

500|$|Deep Blue Sea was {{inspired}} by Australian screenwriter Duncan Kennedy after he witnessed a [...] "horrific" [...] shark attack on a beach near his home. The tragedy contributed to a recurring nightmare of him [...] "being in a passageway with sharks that could read his mind". This motivated him to write a spec script, while acknowledging the challenge of approaching a shark movie without repeating Steven Spielberg's 1975 classic Jaws. Although Warner Bros. bought the script in late 1994, actual development on the project did not start until two years later. When Renny Harlin was chosen to direct the film, Kennedy's screenplay, which had already been re-written by several writers at Warner Bros., was presented to Donna Powers and Wayne Powers, who turned it into the film's final script. According to Wayne, [...] "The movie became essentially what we wrote. The draft we were first presented by [...] was {{much more of a}} military espionage, high-tech action movie, grenade launchers, that kind <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>We</b> wanted our team to include more blue-collar types and not to have weapons to fight back, to play it more as a horror film." ...|$|E
500|$|Angelina's {{dream is}} to be a {{successful}} singer on the music charts. DeGarmo noted that her father, Angelo, [...] "who thinks his spoiled-brat daughter sings like a choir of angels" [...] puts pressure on Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), a young and upcoming music producer, to show Angelina the ropes of the music industry and make her a success. DeGarmo said: [...] "Unfortunately, she’s not as good a singer as she and her father think she is [...] Angelina is a bit oblivious to reality, but will slowly come to grips with it over the next few weeks. As a singer myself, it’s liberating to get on the set and throw all ego – and notes – aside and surprise people." [...] DeGarmo commented: [...] "It's fantastically hilarious because it puts the poor kid in a horrible predicament!" [...] She said that Angelina was into Top 40 music at first, but: [...] "the writers have her singing the American standards — Judy Garland, that sort <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>We</b> want the audience to be really familiar with the songs, so they can tell how badly Angie is butchering them." [...] Michael Logan of TV Guide noted that you needed [...] "skill to play a bad singer", to which DeGarmo said that it's harder than people realize: [...] "but it's really liberating {{to get out there and}} be bad. You just throw your ego to the wind and sing for Jesus." [...] Devon would eventually go on to make Angelina a good singer. Angelina briefly fired Devon for adding rap verses to a song of hers which was soaring on the charts, but he retained the rights of the track.|$|E
2500|$|On January 28, 2014, {{the lead}} off single to {{the album was}} {{released}} and the album title was revealed as Gravity. [...] On July 28, the album's release date was confirmed to be September 23, 2014. [...] In addition, the track listing and cover art were also revealed the next day. [...] The duo said that their decision {{to start their own}} label was the result of Warner Bros. Nashville's schedule not allowing for Gravity to be released until 2015 at the earliest. [...] Rather than have the project shelved, Big & Rich opted to strike out on their own and release the album sooner. [...] Of the decision to form their own label, Kenny said that [...] "it’s the kind <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> believed in ten years ago as the Musik Mafia. Just anyway to get the music out there." [...] The second single from Gravity, [...] "Run Away with You", charted at number 11 on Country Airplay. [...] "Lovin' Lately", a duet with Tim McGraw, is the third single.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The Internet <b>of</b> <b>Things</b> is a {{paradigm}} {{that allows the}} interaction of ubiquitous devices through a network to achieve common goals. This paradigm like any man-made infrastructure is subject to disasters, outages and other adversarial conditions. Under these situations provisioned communications fail, rendering this paradigm {{with little or no}} use. Hence, network self-organization among these devices is needed to allow for communication resilience. This paper presents a survey of related work in the area of self-organization and discusses future research opportunities and challenges for self-organization in the Internet <b>of</b> <b>Things.</b> <b>We</b> begin this paper with a system perspective of the Internet <b>of</b> <b>Things.</b> <b>We</b> then identify and describe the key components of self-organization in the Internet <b>of</b> <b>Things</b> and discuss enabling technologies. Finally we discuss possible tailoring of prior work of other related applications to suit the needs of self-organization in the Internet <b>of</b> <b>Things</b> paradigm...|$|R
