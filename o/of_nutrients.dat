40|$|Abstract. The N/P ratio <b>of</b> <b>nutrient</b> uptake, {{the change}} of {{dissolved}} inorganic nitrogen (DIN) relative to {{the change of}} dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP), is a key parameter for many ecological models. In the Baltic Sea ecosystem, the N/P ratio <b>of</b> <b>nutrient</b> uptake varies among different basins and different seasons. The N/P ratio <b>of</b> <b>nutrient</b> alteration, i. e., the ratio of DIN to DIP altered before and after spring blooms, {{is not the same}} as the N/P ratio <b>of</b> <b>nutrient</b> uptake, but the former can be regarded as an indicator of the latter in the Baltic Sea. Based on the observed N/P ratio <b>of</b> <b>nutrient</b> al-teration, we hypothesize a non-Redfield N/P ratio <b>of</b> <b>nutrient</b> uptake. The 3 -D-ecosystem model ERGOM coupled with the circulation model DMI-BSHcmod was used to test this hypothesis.

40|$|The N/P ratio <b>of</b> <b>nutrient</b> uptake, i. e., {{the ratio}} of {{dissolved}} inorganic nitrogen (DIN) to dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) taken by primary producers, varies in different basins and in different seasons in the Baltic Sea.

5|$|Most {{laboratory}} {{techniques for}} growing bacteria use high levels <b>of</b> <b>nutrients</b> to produce {{large amounts of}} cells cheaply and quickly. However, in natural environments, nutrients are limited, meaning that bacteria cannot continue to reproduce indefinitely. This nutrient limitation has led the evolution of different growth strategies (see r/K selection theory). Some organisms can grow extremely rapidly when nutrients become available, such as the formation of algal (and cyanobacterial) blooms that often occur in lakes during the summer. Other organisms have adaptations to harsh environments, such as the production of multiple antibiotics by Streptomyces that inhibit the growth of competing microorganisms. In nature, many organisms live in communities (e.g., biofilms) that may allow for increased supply <b>of</b> <b>nutrients</b> and protection from environmental stresses. These relationships can be essential for growth of a particular organism or group of organisms (syntrophy).|$|E
