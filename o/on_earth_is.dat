5|$|Time <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> {{the fifth}} studio album by the pop-rock band Crowded House. Tracks have been {{produced}} by both Ethan Johns and Steve Lillywhite and the album was released on 30 June 2007 in Australia, 2 July in the United Kingdom and 10 July in North America. Time <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> the band's first studio album since 1993, and marks the reunion of the band eleven years after they disbanded and features new drummer Matt Sherrod {{in place of the}} original drummer, Paul Hester, who took his own life in 2005.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research {{conducted}} {{a search for}} natural hassium. This was done underground to avoid interference and false positives from cosmic rays, but no results have been released, strongly implying that no natural hassium was found.

5|$|On {{geophysical}} evidence, {{most of the}} nickel <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> {{believed to}} be in the Earth's outer and inner cores. Kamacite and taenite are naturally occurring alloys of iron and nickel. For kamacite, the alloy is usually in the proportion of 90:10 to 95:5, although impurities (such as cobalt or carbon) may be present, while for taenite the nickel content is between 20% and 65%. Kamacite and taenite are also found in nickel iron meteorites.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} life <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> not well understood, but it {{is known to have}} {{occurred}} at least 3.5billion years ago, during the hadean or archean eons on a primordial Earth that had a substantially different environment than is found at present. These life forms possessed the basic traits of self-replication and inheritable traits. Once life had appeared, the process of evolution by natural selection resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.|$|E

5|$|Calcium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ca and atomic number 20. An alkaline earth metal, calcium is a reactive pale yellow metal that forms a dark oxide-nitride layer {{when exposed to}} air. Its {{physical and chemical properties}} are most similar to its heavier homologues strontium and barium. It is the fifth most abundant element in Earth's crust and the third most abundant metal, after iron and aluminium. The most common calcium compound <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> calcium carbonate, found in limestone and the fossilised remnants of early sea life; gypsum, anhydrite, fluorite, and apatite are also sources of calcium.|$|E
5|$|Iridium {{is one of}} {{the nine}} least {{abundant}} stable elements in Earth's crust, having an average mass fraction of 0.001ppm in crustal rock; gold is 40 times more abundant, platinum is 10 times more abundant, and silver and mercury are 80 times more abundant. Tellurium is about as abundant as iridium. In contrast to its low abundance in crustal rock, iridium is relatively common in meteorites, with concentrations of 0.5ppm or more. The overall concentration of iridium <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> thought to be much higher than what is observed in crustal rocks, but because of the density and siderophilic ("iron-loving") character of iridium, it descended below the crust and into Earth's core when the planet was still molten.|$|E
5|$|Over nine-tenths of {{the total}} biomass <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> plant life, on which animal life depends very heavily for its existence. More than 2 million species {{of plant and animal}} life have been {{identified}} to date, and estimates of the actual number of existing species range from several million to well over 50million. The number of individual species of life is constantly in some degree of flux, with new species appearing and others ceasing to exist on a continual basis. The total number of species is in rapid decline.|$|E
2500|$|The Harmonites were Millennialists, in {{that they}} {{believed}} Jesus Christ <b>was</b> coming to <b>earth</b> in their lifetime to help usher in a thousand-year kingdom of peace <b>on</b> <b>earth.</b> This <b>is</b> perhaps why they believed that people should try to make themselves [...] "pure" [...] and [...] "perfect", and share things with others while willingly living in communal [...] "harmony" [...] (Acts [...] ) and practicing celibacy.

5|$|Peace <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> {{the first}} Christmas album by American Christian rock band Casting Crowns. Produced by Mark Hall and Mark A. Miller, it was {{released}} on October 7, 2008. Intended by Hall {{to bring out the}} worshipful aspect of Christmas, the album does not have songs relating to secular Christmas traditions, instead featuring a mix of traditional Christmas carols and original songs. As co-producer, Hall attempted to differentiate the album from their previous ones by attempting to use creative ideas they had not tried before, and he also wanted to utilize the band's female members in a broader and more visible role on the album.|$|E
5|$|The Last Dog <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> a 2003 {{young adult}} novel written by Daniel Ehrenhaft. It follows Logan, a lonely 14-year-old boy who adopts a dog from an animal shelter and names her Jack. The pair's {{relationship}} is soon threatened by an incurable prion disease spreading across the nation. Infected dogs become unnaturally violent and bloodthirsty, {{culminating in the}} deaths of several people. As public fear heightens and the government intervenes to control the outbreak, Logan struggles to reform his life and remain with Jack.|$|E
5|$|The {{unusually high}} {{concentration}} of oxygen gas <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> {{the result of the}} oxygen cycle. This biogeochemical cycle describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on Earth: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the lithosphere. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis, which is responsible for modern Earth's atmosphere. Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere, while respiration, decay, and combustion remove it from the atmosphere. In the present equilibrium, production and consumption occur at the same rate.|$|E

5|$|Copper {{has been}} in use at least 10,000 years, but more than 95% of all copper ever mined and smelted has been {{extracted}} since 1900, {{and more than half}} was extracted the last 24 years. As with many natural resources, the total amount of copper <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> vast, with around 1014 tons in the top kilometer of Earth's crust, which is about 5 million years' worth at the current rate of extraction. However, {{only a tiny fraction of}} these reserves is economically viable with present-day prices and technologies. Estimates of copper reserves available for mining vary from 25 years to 60 years, depending on core assumptions such as the growth rate. Recycling is a major source of copper in the modern world. Because of these and other factors, the future of copper production and supply is the subject of much debate, including the concept of peak copper, analogous to peak oil.|$|E
5|$|Most helium <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> {{a result}} of {{radioactive}} decay. Helium is found in large amounts in minerals of uranium and thorium, including cleveite, pitchblende, carnotite and monazite, because they emit alpha particles (helium nuclei, He2+) to which electrons immediately combine {{as soon as the}} particle is stopped by the rock. In this way an estimated 3000 metric tons of helium are generated per year throughout the lithosphere. in Natural Sources of Helium |journal = Phys. Rev. |volume=74|issue= 11 |pages= 1590–1594 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.74.1590|bibcode = 1948PhRv...74.1590A }} In the Earth's crust, the concentration of helium is 8 parts per billion. In seawater, the concentration is only 4 parts per trillion. There are also small amounts in mineral springs, volcanic gas, and meteoric iron. Because helium is trapped in the subsurface under conditions that also trap natural gas, the greatest natural concentrations of helium on the planet are found in natural gas, from which most commercial helium is extracted. The concentration varies in a broad range from a few ppm to more than 7% in a small gas field in San Juan County, New Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The {{biosphere}} is {{the part}} of Earth's outer shell– including land, surface rocks, water, air and the atmosphere– within which life occurs, and which biotic processes in turn alter or transform. From the broadest geophysiological point of view, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere (rocks), hydrosphere (water), and atmosphere (air). The entire Earth contains over 75billion tons (150 trillion pounds or about 6.8×1013kilograms) of biomass (life), which lives within various environments within the biosphere.) and 455billion kg (between 845billion and 975billion lb, or about 423million–488million short tons). The total biomass of all kinds <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> <b>is</b> estimated to be in excess of 6.8x1013kg (75billion short tons). By these calculations, the portion of total biomass accounted for by humans would be very roughly 0.6%.|$|E

5|$|The {{continental}} crust {{consists of}} lower density material {{such as the}} igneous rocks granite and andesite. Less common is basalt, a denser volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors. Sedimentary rock is formed from the accumulation of sediment that becomes buried and compacted together. Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about 5% of the crust. The third form of rock material found <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> metamorphic rock, which is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures, high temperatures, or both. The most abundant silicate minerals on Earth's surface include quartz, feldspars, amphibole, mica, pyroxene and olivine. Common carbonate minerals include calcite (found in limestone) and dolomite.|$|E
5|$|The two DNA strands {{are called}} polynucleotides {{since they are}} {{composed}} of simpler monomer units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases — cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A) or thymine (T) — a sugar called deoxyribose and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined {{to one another in}} a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA. The total amount of related DNA base pairs <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> estimated at 5.0 x 1037 and weighs 50 billion tonnes. In comparison, the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as 4 trillion tons of carbon (TtC).|$|E
5|$|Under {{terrestrial}} conditions, {{conversion of}} one element to another is very rare. Therefore, {{the amount of}} carbon <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> effectively constant. Thus, processes that use carbon must obtain it from somewhere and dispose of it somewhere else. The paths of carbon in the environment form the carbon cycle. For example, photosynthetic plants draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (or seawater) and build it into biomass, as in the Calvin cycle, a process of carbon fixation. Some of this biomass is eaten by animals, while some carbon is exhaled by animals as carbon dioxide. The carbon cycle is considerably more complicated than this short loop; for example, some carbon dioxide is dissolved in the oceans; if bacteria do not consume it, dead plant or animal matter may become petroleum or coal, which releases carbon when burned.|$|E
