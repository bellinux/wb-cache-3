5|$|Petronas, a Malaysian {{national}} {{oil and gas}} company, {{was formed}} in 1974. As a result, a concession system was changed into production sharing contract system (PSC) between Shell and Petronas. All the foreign oil companies including Shell required to obtain licenses from Petronas. The first two PSCs were signed on 30 November 1976. Foreign oil companies are required to keep not more than 41% of the oil produced until their original costs are recovered. After a return of their investments, the oil companies will keep 30% of the revenue after all operating costs and oil royalties are deducted. Petronas also formed a company named Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd which was {{directly involved in the}} exploration, development, and production of oil and gas in the country. Petronas also initiated the Baram Delta Gas Gathering (Bardegg) project which involves the collection and compression of gas from five fields, namely Betty, Bekor, Baram, Baronia, and West Lutong, located 10km to 45km offshore from Miri. This is to ensure the minimisation of gas loss during oil production. Petronas and Shell are also involved in educational outreach activities such as awarding scholarships to deserving students. Both companies are also involved in Malaysian first rig-to-reef project, in an effort to preserve bio-marine life in the sea offshore Miri. In this project, an abandoned <b>offshore</b> <b>platform</b> was made {{to become part of the}} Siwa reef. Both companies also started to establish Piasau Nature Reserve in 2014.|$|E
25|$|Only {{six days}} after the {{agreement}} {{for the formation of}} the company was signed between STX Finland Cruise Oy and United Shipbuilding Corporation on 10 December 2010, the newly founded Arctech Helsinki Shipyard received an order for two multipurpose icebreaking supply vessels from the Russian state-owned shipping company Sovcomflot. The value of the shipbuilding contract was US$200 million and the construction of the vessels would provide work for 1,000 man-years. Initially, both ships were set to be delivered to the customer in April 2013, after which they will be used for standby, supply and ice management of an <b>offshore</b> <b>platform</b> operated by Exxon Neftegas Limited in the Arkutun-Dagi offshore oil field, located in the Sea of Okhotsk.|$|E
500|$|In Texas, {{the storm}} surge was {{reported}} as high as [...] at Port Mansfield, though {{it may have been}} higher elsewhere along the Texas coast. A peak wind gust of [...] was also measured at Port Mansfield. Tropical storm-force winds in Corpus Christi, Texas blew roof gravel through the city, which led to substantial glass breakage to the 18-story Guarantee Bank Building and a 12-story wing of Spohn hospital. The storm caused seven deaths in Texas and 17 in Louisiana (most resulting from the crash of a helicopter evacuating workers from an <b>offshore</b> <b>platform).</b> Allen spawned several tornadoes in Texas. One tornado caused $100million in damage when it hit Austin, Texas, making it the costliest tropical cyclone-spawned tornado in recorded history. Overall, however, the storm caused limited damage in the United States due to its suddenly diminished power and because its highest tides and winds hit a sparsely-populated portion of the Texas coast.|$|E

2500|$|MBDA {{has started}} testing a {{maritime}} variant for use against swarms of small boats named Sea SPEAR. On 25 June 2012 a Tornado GR4 dropped a prototype that hit and sank a 6-metre inflatable boat travelling at 20kts in sea state 3. The following month MBDA {{said that a}} viable system could be offered [...] "within months"; the initial focus is on deployment from fast jets and surface launchers, MBDA is marketing it in the Gulf for installation on vessels down to 15 m. On 29 May 2013, MBDA conducted a salvo firing of three millimetric wave operational Brimstone missiles, launched from a fixed <b>offshore</b> <b>platform,</b> against a simulated attack formation of five targets representing FIACs (Fast Inshore attack Craft). The successful test firing demonstrated Sea SPEAR's ability to strike numerous individual targets. During the test one of the targets, a 15-metre craft, was travelling at 20 knots. MBDA pitted Sea SPEAR against the Raytheon Sea Griffin missile for integration onto American Littoral combat ships. The US Navy instead selected the AGM-114L Hellfire as a stop-gap missile for the LCS.|$|E

40|$|Between {{the east}} coast of Malaysia Peninsula and the west coast of Sabah and Sarawak lies South China Sea, which locate more than a hundred of <b>offshore</b> <b>platforms,</b> which extract oil and gas for major oil {{production}} companies such as PETRONAS and SHELL. One of the major problems of these platforms is the occurrence of subsidence, which may cause disaster to man and platform itself. Since these <b>offshore</b> <b>platforms</b> are located hundreds of kilometers from shore, the GPS technique is seemed the only possible method that is able to carry out subsidence monitoring for geodetic method. This paper will look at the potential of GPS technique for monitoring of subsidence of these platforms in Malaysian waters. The existence of MASS stations in Peninsular Malaysia and in Sabah and Sarawak that continuously logging in data throughout the years give an option for carrying out subsidence monitoring of <b>offshore</b> <b>platforms.</b> The Bernese GPS Software is used in the processing of these GPS data and the output will then use for the detection of subsidence of these <b>offshore</b> <b>platforms.</b> This paper will also discuss the strategy of data processing and subsidence detection of the <b>offshore</b> <b>platforms</b> located in the Malaysian waters...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{discovery}} of {{a significant number of}} oil and gas deposits in the seabed increased the amount of <b>offshore</b> installations. <b>Offshore</b> <b>platforms</b> are potential environmental threats, obstacles for yachts, low flying airplanes and merchant ships making at risk the safety of maritime traffic. In principle, any metallic target over the ocean surface is responsible for a lager backscattering compared to the one coming from the surrounding sea surface. For this reason, <b>offshore</b> <b>platforms</b> are expected to appear in SAR intensity images as spots brighter than the background sea. However, the measurements reported in this paper show that information provided by backscattered intensity collected in single-polarization is not always sufficient to effectively observe <b>offshore</b> <b>platforms.</b> Exploiting the multi-polarization capabilities of TerraSAR-X, different factors affecting the backscattering, and hence their detection, of <b>offshore</b> <b>platforms</b> is deeply analysed. In particular, under different viewing geometries, all dual-polarimetric modes are investigated...|$|R
