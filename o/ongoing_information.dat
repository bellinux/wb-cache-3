A large advisory board may result in managerial issues. Therefore, if is recommended {{an advisory}} board {{to begin with the}} advisory board leader, and grow from a fairly small size to its ultimate number. Group dynamics suggests the maximum size for an advisory board is eight members, which takes into account of the need for enterprise people and other facilitators at meetings.

Specifically, we present three novel research ideas: (1) transition from the current file-based awareness systems to task-based awareness, (2) transition from reactive conflict detection to proactive conflict prediction, and (3) a degree-of-conflict model that models conflicts per task per workspace, which can be used to recommend an optimum task list for a developer...|$|R
40|$|Background: This study {{sought to}} gain insight into how Deaf Australians who use Auslan as their primary {{language}} perceive their English literacy and if {{they feel that they}} can sufficiently access preventative and <b>ongoing</b> health care <b>information,</b> and to explore their views in regards to accessing information in Auslan. Method: A phenomenological, inductive study, with data collected through 72 semi-structured interviews with Deaf Auslan users identified through non-probabilistic, purposeful and network sampling. Data was thematically analysed for identification of issues related to healthcare information access through English. Results: Deaf people experience barriers in accessing healthcare information because of limited English literacy and a lack of information being available in Auslan, apart from when Auslan interpreters are present in health care appointments. Conclusion: Many Deaf people in Australia lack consistent access to preventative and <b>ongoing</b> health care <b>information.</b> It is important {{to be aware of the}} English literacy levels of patients. More funding is needed for the provision of interpreting services in other healthcare contexts and the translation of materials into Auslan. 4 page(s...|$|R
