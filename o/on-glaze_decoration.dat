5000|$|Overglaze decoration, {{overglaze}} enamelling or <b>on-glaze</b> <b>decoration</b> is {{a method}} of decorating pottery, most often porcelain, where the coloured decoration is applied {{after it has been}} glazed. It is often described as producing [...] "enamelled" [...] decoration. When the ware is fired, or re-fired in the case of twice-fired ware, the colours fuse into the glaze and so the decoration becomes durable. Because the decorating fire can be at a lower temperature with overglaze decoration, a more varied palette of colours is available than with underglaze decoration, where the coloured pattern is applied before glazing.|$|E
