25|$|Doctor Who also {{appeared}} {{on television in}} the form of special <b>one-off</b> productions to <b>benefit</b> charity. In 1993, Dimensions in Time was produced for the benefit of Children in Need, coinciding with the series' 30th Anniversary. It was a special in two parts, running about 12 minutes in total, which featured all surviving Doctors (including Tom Baker in his first appearance as the character since 1981), {{and more than a dozen}} former companions. Not meant to be taken seriously, the story had the Rani opening a hole in time, cycling the Doctor and his companions through his previous incarnations and menacing them with monsters from the show's past. It also featured a crossover with the soap opera EastEnders, the action taking place in the latter's Albert Square location.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} based on work {{conducted}} by Imp-Act a three-year action-research programme aiming {{to improve the quality}} of microfinance services and their impact on poverty. Learning from the experiences of 30 microfinance organisations (MFOs) in four continents, Imp-Act is developing and encouraging the use of internal practitioner-focused impact assessment that can serve as a means to improve practice and service delivery, not merely satisfy the needs of external stakeholders. The paper looks specifically at the benefits of designing and implementing effective practitioner-focused client and impact assessment. It considers the types of questions MFOs should be asking in terms of use of impact assessment tools, such as indicators. It makes the point that impact assessment must be context-specific, taking into consideration the type of information to be gathered and the purpose of this information. Above all, it stresses that impact assessment is an ongoing process, rather than a <b>one-off</b> event which <b>benefits</b> neither the clients nor the organisation. Financial Economics,...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The publisher's website is at: [URL] {{policy-makers}} {{are continuing to}} affirm the need for greater economies through standardisation. The benefits of standardisation seem straightforward: repeated designs offering economies through rationalisation and greater use of preassembled manufactured components {{as a result of}} a closer engagement with supply chains. However, a closer investigation of standardisation shows it to be more complex; individual client needs, unique site conditions, planning legislation, late contractor engagement, inadequate knowledge and intermittent manufacturer supply are some of the factors that conspire to limit the benefits of standardisation. This research, as part of an Engineering Doctorate study, examines repeat- and serial-order standardised buildings through multiple case studies where the reasons for their adoption are explored from various stakeholder perspectives. It tests existing theories from literature on standardisation in design and construction efficiency, with an emphasis on specification driven ‘non-iconic’ buildings. With <b>one-off</b> projects the <b>benefits</b> of standardisation are expected to be limited to efficiencies within a project, and there may be limited engagement with a supply-chain. On multiple projects, with dimensionally standard spaces, even in multi-stage tender situations, standardisation is also limited and clients are not strongly motivated to engage with manufacturing. However, there are other projects where clients, designers and contractors have taken an ‘enlightened self-interest’ to collaborate, particularly for repeat order projects, and this leads to an optimised process between the design team, the contractor and their supply chains. These latter projects have better defined briefs and benefit from successive refinements of more linear rationalised design processes with increased use of standardisation and preassembly, particularly for the more dimensionally standard areas of the buildings...|$|R
5000|$|In November 2008, Floyd {{announced}} on the band's forum and MySpace pages {{that he had}} decided to leave the band. The Almighty have been on hiatus since then, aside from a <b>one-off</b> <b>benefit</b> gig in June 2009 for the family of former manager Tommy Tee who had died in December 2008. It was announced in December 2014 that the band's first two studio albums, Blood, Fire & Love and Soul Destruction were to be re-released in early 2015 with additional tracks and live recordings. Ricky Warwick commented about any possible future reunion, saying [...] "I certainly would be open to the idea of doing a few shows. I don’t know how the others feel about it. I love the guys and I love the songs. I would like to play them one day again because life is short and you just get one shot at it".|$|E
40|$|Objective: This paper {{explores the}} use of pharmacoeconomic methods of {{valuation}} to health impacts resulting from exposure to poor air quality. In using such methods, interventions that reduce exposure to poor air quality can be directly compared, {{in terms of value}} for money (or cost-effectiveness), with competing demands for finite resources, including other public health interventions. Design: Using results estimated as part of a health impact assessment regarding a West Yorkshire Low Emission Zone strategy, this paper quantifies cost-saving and health-improving implications of transport policy through its impact on air quality. Data source: Estimates of HRQoL and NHS/PSS costs for identified health events were based on data from Leeds and Bradford using peer-reviewed publications or Office for National Statistics releases. Population: Inhabitants of the area within the outer ring roads of Leeds and Bradford. Main outcomes measures: NHS and PSS costs and QALYs. Results: Averting an all-cause mortality death generates 8. 4 QALYs. Each coronary event avoided saves £ 28, 000 in NHS/PSS costs and generates 1. 1 QALYs. For every fewer case of childhood asthma there will be NHS/PSS cost saving of £ 3, 000 and a health benefit of 0. 9 QALYs. A single term, low birthweight birth avoided saves £ 2, 000 in NHS/PSS costs. Preventing a pre term birth saves £ 24, 000 in NHS/PSS costs and generates 1. 3 QALYs. A scenario modelled in the West Yorkshire Low Emission Zone Feasibility Study, where pre EURO 4 buses and HGVs are upgraded to EURO 6 by 2016 generates an annual benefit of £ 2. 08 million and a <b>one-off</b> <b>benefit</b> of £ 3. 3 million compared to a net present value cost of implementation of £ 6. 3 million. Conclusion: Interventions to improve air quality and health should be evaluated and where improvement of population health is the primary objective, cost-effectiveness analysis using a NHS/PSS costs and QALYs framework is an appropriate methodology...|$|E

40|$|In 2009, the Capital Markets Development Authority (CMDA) - Fiji’s {{capital market}} {{regulator}} - introduced the Code of Corporate Governance (the Code). The Code is ‘principle-based’ and requires companies {{listed on the}} South Pacific Stock Exchange (SPSE) and the financial intermediaries to disclose their compliance with the Code’s principles. While compliance with the Code is mandatory, {{the nature and extent}} of disclosure is at the discretion of the complying entities. Agency theory and signalling theory suggest that firms with higher expected levels of agency costs will provide greater levels of voluntary disclosures as signals of strong corporate governance. Thus, the study seeks to test these theories by examining the heterogeneity of corporate governance disclosures by firms listed on SPSE, and determining the characteristics of firms that provide similar levels of disclosures. We conducted a content analysis of corporate governance disclosures on the annual reports of firms from 2008 - 2012. The study finds that large, non-family owned firms with high levels of shareholder dispersion provide greater quantity and higher quality corporate governance disclosures. For firms that are relatively smaller, family owned and have low levels of shareholder dispersion, the quantity and quality of corporate governance disclosures are much lower. Some of these firms provide boilerplate disclosures with minimal changes in the following years. These findings support the propositions of agency and signalling theory, which suggest that firms with higher separation between agents and principals will provide more voluntary disclosures to reduce expected agency costs transfers. Semi-structured interviews conducted with key stakeholders further reinforce the findings. The interviews also reveal that complying entities positively perceive the introduction of the Code. Furthermore, while compliance with Code brought about additional costs, they believed that most of these costs were minimal and <b>one-off,</b> and the <b>benefits</b> of greater corporate disclosure to improve user decision making outweighed the costs. The study contributes to the literature as it provides insight into the experience of a small capital market with introducing a ‘principle-based’ Code that attempts to encourage corporate governance practices through enhanced disclosure. The study also assists policy makers better understand complying entities’ motivations for compliance and the extent of compliance...|$|R
