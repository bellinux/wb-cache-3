5000|$|On August 14, 2012, IIHS {{released}} the first results for a second, more demanding frontal offset test.The new test, {{which is used}} {{in addition to the}} 40% <b>offset</b> <b>test</b> introduced in 1995, subjects only 25% of {{the front end of the}} vehicle to a 40 mph impact. The new test is far more demanding on the vehicle structure than the 40% <b>offset</b> <b>test.</b> In the first round of test, composed of 11 midsized luxury and near-luxury vehicles, most vehicles did poorly; only three vehicles received [...] "good" [...] or [...] "acceptable" [...] ratings.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigated}} fast {{improvement of}} visual performance in several hyperacuity {{tasks such as}} vernier acuity and stereoscopic depth perception in almost 100 observers. Results indicate that the fast phase of perceptual learning, occurring within less than 1 hr of training, is specific for the visual field position and for the particular hyperacuity task, but is only partly specific for the eye trained and for the <b>offset</b> <b>tested.</b> Learning occurs without feedback. We conjecture that the site of learning may be quite early in the visual pathway...|$|R

Although pencil-shaped beam desirable in many applications, fan-shaped beam preferred in some scanning-radar and mapping-radar systems.

50|$|In December 2008, A3 {{received}} a five-star China-NCAP safety rating, {{becoming the first}} indigenous car to achieve such a high-test rating. The process consists in three different tests; 100% front crash test with a wall (like the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) test), a 40% <b>offset</b> <b>test</b> (like the EuroNCAP) and a side crash test like the EuroNCAP.|$|E
5000|$|The 2001 {{model of}} this version earned a [...] "Poor" [...] rating in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's 40 mph <b>offset</b> <b>test.</b> It did protect its {{occupants}} reasonably well, and the dummy movement was well controlled, however, a fuel leak occurred.

5000|$|In the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's frontal <b>offset</b> <b>test</b> the Colorado (extended version) {{is given}} a [...] "Good" [...] overall score, however the crew cab is rated [...] "Acceptable".
