2500|$|The {{practice}} of [...] "chrismation" [...] (baptism with oil) {{appears to have}} developed {{in the early church}} during the later 2nd century as a symbol of Christ, rebirth, and inspiration. The earliest surviving account of such an act seems to be the letter written [...] "To Autolycus" [...] by Theophilus, bishop of Antioch. In it, he calls the act [...] "sweet and useful", punning on khristós ( [...] , [...] "anointed") and khrēstós ( [...] , [...] "useful"). He seems to go on to say [...] "wherefore we are called Christians on this account, because we are anointed with the oil of God", and [...] "what person on entering into this life or being an athlete is not anointed with oil?" [...] The practice is also defended by Hippolytus in his [...] "Commentary on the Song of Songs" [...] and by Origen in his [...] "Commentary on Romans". Origen opines that [...] "all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>may</b> be baptized in those visible waters and in a visible anointing, in accordance with the form handed down to the churches".|$|E
2500|$|American critics {{tended to}} have more mixed feelings, like Collider.com, who called the film [...] "an {{engaging}} yet uneven meldodrama", and Variety, who stated that while the film was [...] "a welcome return to the female-centric storytelling that has earned Almodóvar his greatest acclaim, {{it is far from}} this reformed renegade's strongest or most entertaining work". Similarly mixed, Slant Magazine thought Julieta was not one of Almodóvar's best films, but most compelling because of [...] "the bold, colorful compositions and framings that [...] has long mastered, which sketch psychological detail more acutely than Julieta's methodically orchestrated and rather sluggish story". Twitch Film felt the mellowness of Munro's work did not adapt well to Almodóvar's melodramatic style, concluding that [...] "Almodóvar seems content to let his past strengths wither in favour of banality". Indiewire also thought the director played too safe and called Julieta his most conventional film. The Hollywood Reporter felt the film would satisfy fans of Almodóvar, but was too decorous in comparison to his previous films: [...] "a politeness that's quite unlike the lusty vulgarity of the past. Some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>may</b> not be sure we like it". However, TheWrap thought that [...] "a subdued Almodóvar is still a far sight weirder and more intriguing than most directors", adding that the film is [...] "a worthy part of a canon in which decorous should never be confused with dull".|$|E
