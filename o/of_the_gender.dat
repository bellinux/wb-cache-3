40|$|All {{languages}} {{distinguish between}} genders to a varying degree. Gender stereotypes in language are often gender-specific, where agentic words are considered as male and communal words are considered as female. Studies {{have found that}} countries with gendered languages express more sexism, compared to countries with natural gender or gender-neutral languages. The following study will investigate <b>the</b> assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three <b>gendered</b> pronouns in <b>the</b> Swedish language, by <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> stereotypes (i. e., agentic and communal adjectives). It is also of interest to assess <b>the</b> <b>gendered</b> pronouns and gender stereotypes in relation to sexism or sexist beliefs. No relationship was found between <b>the</b> <b>gendered</b> pronouns and <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> stereotypes in this study.

25|$|Among {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Americas prior to European colonization, a common form of same-sex sexuality centered around {{the figure of the}} Two-Spirit individual.

25|$|Like other trans people, {{transsexual}} {{people may}} refer {{to themselves as}} trans men or trans women. Transsexual people desire to establish a permanent gender role as a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> with which they identify, and many transsexual people pursue medical interventions {{as part of the}} process of expressing their gender. The entire process of switching from one physical sex and social gender presentation to another is often referred to as transitioning, and usually takes several years. Transsexual people who transition usually change their social gender roles, legal names and legal sex designation.|$|E
25|$|Another typical {{change is}} the loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> {{distinction}} in adjectival surnames, especially visible for those ending in -ski (fem.: -ska), -cki (fem.: -cka) and -dzki (fem.: -dzka). Western languages do not distinguish {{between male and female}} surnames, even if the language has gender-specific adjectives (like German, French or Spanish). As the surname is, in most cases, inherited from the father (or accepted from the husband), the Western registries of birth and marriage ascribe the masculine form (the one ending in -i) to the female members of the family. Slavic countries, in contrast, would use the feminine form of the surname (the one ending in -a). So the form Anna Kowalski would never be met within Poland, whereas it is commonly found in the US, Germany or Argentina.|$|E
25|$|Poverty {{cannot be}} defined only by {{statistics}} and reports, {{such as the}} poverty line, {{to see whether or}} not people are impoverished in their respective countries. The concept of social and cultural exclusion helps to better convey poverty as a process that involves multiple agents. Many developing countries have social and cultural norms that prevent women from having access to formal employment. Especially in parts of Asia, North Africa, and Latin America, the cultural and social norms do not allow women to have much labor productivity outside the home as well as an economic bargaining position within the household. This social inequality deprives women of capabilities, particularly employment, which leads to women having a higher risk of poverty. This increase in occupational gender segregation and widening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> wage gap increases women's susceptibility to poverty.|$|E
