40|$|A {{cost model}} was {{developed}} for the Nature Outlook of PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency. This <b>cost</b> model estimates <b>one-off</b> and recurrent <b>costs</b> of natural vegetation based on Corine land cover typesthroughout Europe. Cost estimates were made for the base year 2000 and future scenarios, including aTrend scenario based on current EU policies and normative perspectives, including Strengthening CulturalIdentity (SCI), Allowing Nature to Find its Way (NFW), Going with the Economic Flow (GEF) and Workingwith Nature (WWN). These scenarios all have a time horizon of 2050. To estimate various costs acomprehensive data analysis was carried out and a cost model was developed based on the IKN model forDutch Nature Policy. The model estimates costs of recurrent management in the base year on € 5. 6 billionper year in the EU- 28.

They first analyse 11 different explorative scenarios for 2050 with various technologies, electricity mixes and reduction of climate emissions. After assessing the scenarios through a life cycle analysis against 17 sustainability criteria (ten environmental, three economic and four social indicators), no conclusion could be drawn as to which scenarios were most sustainable. The authors therefore conducted a multi-criteria decision analysis against the environmental sustainability criteria and two economic criteria. The social criteria were discussed in connection with the MCDA results. The MCDA was first done by weighting these 12 criteria evenly. Then, as a sensitivity analysis, and to reflect the different preferences of the stakeholders involved (such as industry or government), different weights were given to three most important criteria across stakeholders, i.e., climate change (GWP), human toxicity (HTP) and <b>costs</b> (<b>annualised)</b> [46].|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} has been to identify the most sustainable options for electricity production in Mexico with an outlook to 2050. An integrated methodology for sustainability assessment of different electricity technologies and scenarios has been developed, taking into account environmental, economic and social aspects. The environmental impacts have been estimated using life cycle assessment; the economic costs considered include total capital and <b>annualised</b> <b>costs</b> while social aspects include security and diversity of energy supply, public acceptability, health and safety impacts and intergenerational issues. To help identify the most sustainable options, multi-criteria decision analysis has been used. The methodology {{has been applied to}} Mexican conditions for the assessment of both current and future electricity production. The results for the current situation show that on a life cycle basis 129 million tonnes of CO 2 eq. are emitted annually from 225 TWh of electricity generated in Mexico. Heavy fuel oil, gas and coal power plants contribute together to 87 % of CO 2 eq. emissions. Total <b>annualised</b> <b>costs</b> are estimated at US$ 22. 4 billion/yr with the fuel costs contributing 54 %, mainly due to the operation of gas and heavy fuel oil power plants. A range of future scenarios up to 2050 has been developed in an attempt to identify the most sustainable options. The development of the scenarios has been driven and informed by the national greenhouse gas emission reduction target of 50 % by 2050 on the 2000 levels, translating to an 85 % reduction from the power sector. The results show that the business as usual (BAU) scenario (with the highest contribution from fossil fuels) is the least sustainable option with the CO 2 eq. emissions increasing by almost 300 % and the <b>annualised</b> <b>costs</b> by 290 % for a projected electricity demand of 813 TWh in 2050. Overall, the most sustainable scenarios are those with higher penetration of renewable energies (wind, solar and hydro) and nuclear power, as in Green, A- 3 and C- 3. For example, compared to the BAU scenarios, the CO 2 eq. emissions reduce by 84 %, 89 % and 89 %, respectively. Although renewable energy based scenarios require high capital <b>costs,</b> the total <b>annualised</b> <b>costs</b> even out over time due to lower fuel <b>costs.</b> The lowest <b>annualised</b> <b>costs</b> are for C- 3 scenario, representing a 40 % reduction on BAU. With respect to social issues, the BAU scenario is also the least preferred option with the highest risks related to security and diversity of supply, health and safety and climate change. The most sustainable options are scenarios A- 3 and Green, with social barriers related to public acceptability, reliability of supply and availability of energy resource. Most critical aspects for scenario C- 3 are health and safety risks, and intergenerational issues related to nuclear power. Therefore, the Mexican Government should aim to strengthen the current low carbon energy policies as well as put measures in place to encourage reducing the electricity demand. In the case of the energy policy driver focusing on climate change mitigation or <b>annualised</b> <b>costs,</b> scenarios A- 3 and C- 3 are the most sustainable options.

However, {{there are a number of}} economic barriers which would have to be addressed in order to make district heating competitive in comparison with alternative heating technologies. The objective of this research was to model and analyse a district heating network and develop an optimisation method to calculate the minimum capital investment, heat losses and pump energy consumption. Firstly, modelling and analysis of a district heating network was conducted to obtain district heating design cases with minimum annual total energy consumption, annual total exergy consumption and <b>annualised</b> <b>cost.</b> Then through the analysis, a two-stage programming model was developed which synthesised design and optimal operation of a district heating network. The optimisation was used to minimise annual total energy consumption, annual total exergy consumption or <b>annualised</b> <b>cost</b> of the heat network by selecting suitable pump and pipe sizes, taking into account different parameters such as target pressure loss, temperature regime and operating strategy. The optimisation technique was used to investigate two different case studies, with high and low heat density. In all cases, a variable flow and variable supply temperature operating method was found to be beneficial. Design cases with minimum annual total energy consumption and <b>annualised</b> <b>cost</b> used rather small pipe diameters and large pressure drops. To achieve the minimum annual total exergy consumption a design case with larger pipe diameters and smaller pressure loss was found to be desirable. It was observed that by reducing the water temperature and increasing temperature difference between supply and return pipes, the annual total energy consumption, annual total exergy consumption and the <b>annualised</b> <b>cost</b> were reduced.

An example of a cap would be an agreement to receive a payment for each month the LIBOR rate exceeds 2.5%. They are most frequently taken out for periods of between 2 and 5 years, although this can vary considerably. Since the strike price reflects the maximum interest rate payable by the purchaser of the cap, it is frequently a whole number integer, for example 5% or 7%. By comparison the underlying index for a cap is frequently a LIBOR rate, or a national interest rate.

In this study we analyse {{the costs and benefits}} of this proposal. We compare the proposal�to the current situation and to two alternative options that strengthen legal unbundling. We identify four mutually-related categories of benefits: better performance of networks, more efficient regulation, improved effectiveness of competition, and benefits of privatisation; and three categories of costs: <b>one-off</b> transaction <b>costs,</b> loss of economies of scope and the risk of less investment in generation. The analysis highlights that the benefits depend on the future development in small-scale generation and on allocation of the management of transmission networks. Mainly because of the uncertainty about the future role of small-scale generation and the uncertainty about the magnitude of the <b>one-off</b> transaction <b>costs</b> related to cross-border leases, the net welfare effect of ownership unbundling at the distribution level is ambiguous.

It postulates that costs of conservation will increase as investors in conservation progress from the least cost conservation technologies, such as attic insulation and storm doors and windows, to heat pumps and solar water heaters. The methodology is that of regression equations and the data are costs of twenty types of capital stocks and the associated quantities of energy conserved. The regression equations of <b>annualised</b> <b>cost</b> on <b>annualised</b> quantities of conservation had a good fit and statistically significant coefficients so that the costs were increasing with increased conservation. The elasticity of cost with respect to conservation was 2 Â· 13 so that an increase in conservation by 1 per cent will increase its cost by more than 2 per cent. The cost-effectiveness of conservation was determined by comparing the cost of conservation per million Btu {{with the cost of}} purchasing an equivalent quantity of energy. It was concluded that energy conservation was cost-effective because the cost was only $ 0 Â· 84 per million Btu compared with the cost of purchasing energy, which was from two to eight times for natural gas to electricity. ...|$|R

One such method involves blending between captured sequences in the frequency domain. This paper streamlines the approach taken by similar previous work. Higher efficiency is obtained both by shifting computations from runtime to pre-processing and by using a simpler technique, which is also more flexible allowing the method {{to be used for}} a greater range of motions. Furthermore, the already-known use of a triangular network defining a continuous blending space is instead presented as an adjustable interface element which is both intuitive and more flexible than applied to earlier work. As before input data may be sparse yet still allows the creation of a continuous spectrum of subtly varying motions, enabling characters to integrate well in their environment. Weighting calculation, blending and Fourier synthesis of realistic-looking motion using five harmonics requires 0. 39 µs per degree of freedom for each frame in the created sequence - a <b>one-off</b> <b>cost</b> incurred only when blending ratios change.

Methods and results The systematic review and economic evaluation was conducted according to internationally recognized methods. The search strategy identified systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and observational studies evaluating the effects of LVADs on survival, functional capacity, and quality of life. Cost-effectiveness was assessed through a 5 -year decision analytic model to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of LVADs compared with usual care. Despite the poor methodological quality of the 18 studies included, LVADs appear beneficial improving survival, functional status, and quality of life. Adverse events are a serious concern. The economic evaluation showed that LVADs had a cost per quality adjusted life year of £ 65 242 (95 % confidence interval £ 34 194 [...] 364 564). Sensitivity analysis showed that post-heart transplant survival gains, pre-heart transplant patient utility, and <b>one-off</b> <b>costs</b> associated with implantation determine cost-effectiveness.

A reduction in core costs would have a significant impact on the total VAT-compliance costs for SMEs. Factors expected to be associated with higher compliance costs are identified and tested in a multivariate framework. Empirical data were obtained from a survey of 4796 firms resulting in a final sample of 1085 firms and a response rate of 25. 1 %. Higher compliance costs (in absolute terms) are associated, inter alia, with increased turnover, newly registered firms, and increased complexity. Firms with higher compliance costs also perceived high psychological costs of VAT compliance. Compliance costs were also higher for individuals who did not have English as their first language, and individuals with special needs. The important implications of the findings for policy are highlighted. ...|$|R
