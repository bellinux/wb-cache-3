40|$|This study aims at the {{autonomous}} seafloor surveillance by underwater vehicles based on computer vision techniques. A novel scheme <b>of</b> <b>seabed</b> image classification is proposed to identify three types <b>of</b> <b>seabed</b> sediments. The texture features <b>of</b> <b>seabed</b> sediments were described by using gray-level co-occurrence matrix and fractal dimension. Subsequently, an unsupervised learning method, Self-Organizing Map, {{was applied to}} analyze the seabed images with the extracted texture features. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed texture feature descriptors were feasible and effective to category the three types <b>of</b> <b>seabed</b> images...|$|R

This paper focuses on defining and extracting robust texture features from visual images that lead to useful and practical automated identification of the types <b>of</b> <b>seabed</b> sediments. The visual texture features are described by using a gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and fractal dimension, after which an unsupervised learning method, self-organizing map (SOM), is adopted to evaluate the validity of features descriptors on three types <b>of</b> <b>seabed</b> sediments. Subsequently, a kernel-based approach that exhibits robustness versus low numbers of high dimensional samples, named support vector domain description (SVDD), is applied to classify the types <b>of</b> <b>seabed</b> sediments. In comparison with state-of-the-art classifiers, the experimental results demonstrated {{the effectiveness of the}} SVDD on the classification <b>of</b> <b>seabed</b> sediments...|$|R

40|$|An {{ability to}} {{estimate}} the large-scale spatial variability <b>of</b> <b>seabed</b> sediment type {{in the absence of}} extensive observational data is valuable for many applications. In some physical (e. g., morphodynamic) models, knowledge <b>of</b> <b>seabed</b> sediment type is important for inputting spatially-varying bed roughness, and in biological studies, an ability {{to estimate the}} distribution <b>of</b> <b>seabed</b> sediment benefits habitat mapping (e. g., scallop dredging). Although shelf sea sediment motion is complex, driven by a combination of tidal currents, waves, and wind-driven currents, in many tidally energetic seas, such as the Irish Sea, long-term seabed sediment transport is dominated by tidal currents. We compare observations <b>of</b> <b>seabed</b> sediment grain size from 242 Irish Sea seabed samples with simulated tidal-induced bed shear stress from a three-dimensional tidal model (ROMS) to quantitatively define the relationship between observed grain size and simulated bed shear stress. With focus on the median grain size <b>of</b> well-sorted <b>seabed</b> sediment samples, we present predictive maps of the distribution <b>of</b> <b>seabed</b> sediment classes in the Irish Sea, ranging from mud to gravel. When compared with the distribution of well-sorted sediment classifications (mud, sand and gravel) from the British Geological Survey digital <b>seabed</b> sediment map <b>of</b> Irish <b>Sea</b> sediments (DigSBS 250), this â��grain size tidal current proxyâ�� (GSTCP) correctly estimates the observed seabed sediment classification in over 73 % of the area...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the analysis of side-looking sonar images, and specif- ically with the identification of the types <b>of</b> <b>seabed</b> that are present in such images, and with the detection of man-made objects in such images. Side-looking sonar images are, broadly speaking, the result of the physical interaction between acous- tic waves and the bottom <b>of</b> the <b>sea.</b> Because <b>of</b> this interaction, the types <b>of</b> <b>seabed</b> appear as textured areas in side-looking sonar images. The texture descrip- tors commonly used in the field of sonar imagery fail at accurately identifying the types <b>of</b> <b>seabed</b> because the types <b>of</b> <b>seabed,</b> hence the textures, are extremely variable. In this thesis, we did not use the traditional texture descriptors to identify the types <b>of</b> <b>seabed.</b> We rather used scattering operators which recently appeared in the field of signal and image processing. We assessed how well the types <b>of</b> <b>seabed</b> are identified through two inference algorithms, one based on affine spaces, and the other based on the concept of similarity by composition. This thesis is also concerned with the detection of man-made objects in side-looking sonar im- ages. An object detector may be described as a method which, when applied to a certain number of sonar images, produces a set of detections. Some of these are true positives, and correspond to real objects. Others are false positives, and do not correspond to real objects. The present object detectors suffer from a high false positive rate in complex environments, that is to say, complex types <b>of</b> <b>seabed.</b> The hypothesis we will follow is {{that it is possible to}} reduce the number of false positives through a characterisation of the similarity between the detections and the seabed, the false positives being by nature part <b>of</b> the <b>seabed.</b> We will use scattering operators to represent the detections and the same two inference algorithms to quantify how similar the detections are to the seabed...|$|R
