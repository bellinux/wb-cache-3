Illusions Perdues extends {{to a thousand}} pages after starting inauspiciously in a small-town print shop, whereas La Fille aux yeux d'or (The Girl with the Golden Eyes, 1835) opens with a broad panorama of Paris but becomes a closely plotted novella of only fifty pages.|$|E
5|$|William Harrison Ainsworth, a Victorian novelist {{considered}} {{in his day}} the equal <b>of</b> <b>Dickens,</b> wrote a romanticised account of the Pendle witches published in 1849. The Lancashire Witches {{is the only one}} of his 40 novels never to have been out of print. The British writer Robert Neill dramatised the events of 1612 in his novel Mist over Pendle, first published in 1951. The writer and poet Blake Morrison treated the subject in his suite of poems Pendle Witches, published in 1996, and in 2011 poet Simon Armitage narrated a documentary on BBC Four, The Pendle Witch Child.|$|E
5|$|In the 1790s {{the house}} {{was used as a}} {{boarding}} school for young gentlemen run by a Mr William Sewell.

A noted horsewoman, the site of her former stables is now occupied, in part, by Sinclair House.She spent much of the winters abroad and her house was let in her absence. One of the many long standing residents was the Revd.

These include the Charles Dickens Museum in London, the {{historic}} home where he wrote Oliver Twist, The Pickwick Papers and Nicholas Nickleby; and the Charles Dickens Birthplace Museum in Portsmouth, the house {{in which he was}} born. The original manuscripts of many of his novels, as well as printers' proofs, first editions, and illustrations from the collection of Dickens's friend John Forster are held at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Dickens's will stipulated that no memorial be erected in his honour; nonetheless, a life-size bronze statue <b>of</b> <b>Dickens</b> entitled Dickens and Little Nell, cast in 1891 by Francis Edwin Elwell, stands in Clark Park in the Spruce Hill neighbourhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Another life-size statue <b>of</b> <b>Dickens</b> is located at Centennial Park, Sydney, Australia.

The festival includes a production of one of Dickens' novels, with people about the town wearing Victorian dress.

25|$|Thackeray {{saw himself}} as writing in the {{realistic}} tradition, and distinguished his work from the exaggerations and sentimentality <b>of</b> <b>Dickens.</b> Some later commentators have accepted this self-evaluation and seen him as a realist, but others note his inclination to use eighteenth-century narrative techniques, such as digressions and direct addresses to the reader, and argue that through them he frequently disrupts the illusion of reality. The school of Henry James, {{with its emphasis on}} maintaining that illusion, marked a break with Thackeray's techniques.|$|E
25|$|Cruikshank's claims {{surrounding}} the works <b>of</b> <b>Dickens</b> and Ainsworth stem from his early involvement with Ainsworth as illustrator for various works by Ainsworth that {{were published in}} The Bentley's Miscellany and the Ainsworth's Magazine. Although Tony Johannot was first used to illustrate Ainsworth's first work in the Ainsworth's Magazine, Windsor Castle, Cruikshank became the dominant illustrator and replaced him in the role {{for the majority of}} the novel. Once Cruikshank joined with Ainsworth, Cruikshank moved his efforts from his own magazine, The Omnibus, to the Ainsworth's Magazine and focused completely on the magazine.|$|E

25|$|In 1948, Leavis {{focused his}} {{attention}} on fiction and made his general statement about the English novel in The Great Tradition where he traced this claimed tradition through Jane Austen, George Eliot, Henry James, and Joseph Conrad. Contentiously, Leavis, and his followers, excluded major authors such as Charles Dickens, Laurence Sterne and Thomas Hardy from his canon, characterising Dickens as a mere entertainer, but eventually, following the revaluation <b>of</b> <b>Dickens</b> by Edmund Wilson and George Orwell, Leavis changed his position, publishing Dickens the Novelist in 1970. The Leavisites' downgrading of Hardy may have damaged Leavis's own authority.|$|E
25|$|As a poet, Hopkins's father {{published}} works including A Philosopher's Stone and Other Poems (1843), Pietas Metrica (1849), and Spicelegium Poeticum, A Gathering of Verses by Manley Hopkins (1892). He reviewed poetry for The Times {{and wrote}} one novel. Catherine (Smith) Hopkins {{was the daughter}} of a London physician, particularly fond of music and of reading, especially German philosophy, literature and the novels <b>of</b> <b>Dickens.</b> Both parents were deeply religious High Church Anglicans. Catherine's sister, Maria Smith Giberne, taught her nephew Gerard to sketch. The interest was supported by his uncle, Edward Smith, his great-uncle Richard James Lane, a professional artist, and many other family members. Hopkins's first ambitions were to be a painter, and he would continue to sketch throughout his life, inspired, as an adult, by the work of John Ruskin and the Pre-Raphaelites.|$|E
25|$|Dickens was {{regarded}} as the literary colossus of his age. His 1843 novella, A Christmas Carol, remains popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre. Oliver Twist and Great Expectations are also frequently adapted, and, {{like many of his}} novels, evoke images of early Victorian London. His 1859 novel, A Tale of Two Cities, set in London and Paris, is his best-known work of historical fiction. Dickens has been praised by fellow writers—from Leo Tolstoy to George Orwell and G. K. Chesterton—for his realism, comedy, prose style, unique characterisations, and social criticism. On the other hand, Oscar Wilde, Henry James, and Virginia Woolf complained of a lack of psychological depth, loose writing, and a vein of saccharine sentimentalism. The term Dickensian is used to describe something that is reminiscent <b>of</b> <b>Dickens</b> and his writings, such as poor social conditions or comically repulsive characters.|$|E

25|$|Authors {{frequently}} {{draw their}} portraits of characters from people they have known in real life. David Copperfield is regarded {{by many as}} a veiled autobiography <b>of</b> <b>Dickens.</b> The scenes of interminable court cases and legal arguments in Bleak House reflect Dickens's experiences as a law clerk and court reporter, and in particular his direct experience of the law's procedural delay during 1844 when he sued publishers in Chancery for breach of copyright. Dickens's father was {{sent to prison for}} debt, and this became a common theme in many of his books, with the detailed depiction of life in the Marshalsea prison in Little Dorrit resulting from Dickens's own experiences of the institution. Lucy Stroughill, a childhood sweetheart, may have affected several of Dickens's portraits of girls such as Little Em'ly in David Copperfield and Lucie Manette in A Tale of Two Cities. Dickens may have drawn on his childhood experiences, but he was also ashamed of them and would not reveal that this was where he gathered his realistic accounts of squalor. Very few knew the details of his early life until six years after his death, when John Forster published a biography on which Dickens had collaborated. Though Skimpole brutally sends up Leigh Hunt, some critics have detected in his portrait features of Dickens's own character, which he sought to exorcise by self-parody.|$|E
500|$|Balzac {{influenced}} {{writers of}} his time and beyond. He {{has been compared to}} Charles Dickens and is considered one of Dickens' significant influences. Literary critic W. H. Helm calls one [...] "the French Dickens" [...] and the other [...] "the English Balzac", while another critic, Richard Lehan, states that [...] "Balzac was the bridge between the comic realism <b>of</b> <b>Dickens</b> and the naturalism of Zola".|$|E
500|$|The {{style and}} {{themes of the}} book have been seen to help stretch young readers' {{literacy}} skills, preparing them to approach the works <b>of</b> <b>Dickens</b> and Shakespeare. By contrast, offering advanced younger readers modern teenage-oriented fiction may not exercise their reading skills, while the material may contain themes more suited to adolescents. As one of several books that have been recommended for 11- to 14-year-old boys to encourage literacy in that demographic, The Hobbit is promoted as [...] "the original and still the best fantasy ever written." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>Dickens's</b> major novels {{were first}} written in monthly or weekly {{instalments}} in journals such as Master Humphrey's Clock and Household Words, later reprinted in book form. These instalments made the stories affordable and accessible, and {{the series of}} regular cliff-hangers made each new episode widely anticipated. When The Old Curiosity Shop was being serialised, American fans waited at the docks in New York, shouting out to the crew of an incoming ship, [...] "Is little Nell dead?" [...] Part <b>of</b> <b>Dickens's</b> great talent was to incorporate this episodic writing style but still {{end up with a}} coherent novel at the end.|$|R
