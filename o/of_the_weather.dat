30|$|<b>The</b> <b>weathered</b> {{rocks on}} <b>the</b> {{external}} walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yungang Grottoes, which are typically exposed stone relics, were evaluated in this study. First, <b>the</b> <b>weathered</b> zones on <b>the</b> external walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grottoes (Fig.  1 c) were tested using a nondestructive ultrasonic machine, {{and the corresponding}} ultrasonic velocities were calculated. It has been referenced from the Engineering Geologic Mapping Committee <b>of</b> <b>the</b> International Engineering Geology Association and the Laboratory and Site Standard Committee <b>of</b> <b>the</b> International Rock Mechanics Association [13], the longitudinal ultrasonic velocity ratios <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weathered</b> and fresh rocks represent <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> levels <b>of</b> rocks in <b>the</b> Yungang Grottoes, as well as <b>the</b> classification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> degrees for materials such as marble and granite [14 – 16]. Next, the terahertz (THz) spectra <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> samples in <b>the</b> study area were measured using a terahertz time-domain spectrum system (THz-TDS). This is a non-destructive, non-ionizing, high-sensitivity spectral system for synchronous coherent detection using samples weighing only approximately 0.2  g [17 – 20]. The THz spectral data and <b>the</b> corresponding <b>weathering</b> levels determined by means <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ultrasonic tests were combined as training and test samples. Last, a regression model for prediction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grotto walls was established based on these samples using a least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM). The LS-SVM employs a machine learning software package known for its quick operation, strong generalization, and ability to solve various practical problems, such as those involving small sample sizes, over-fitting, and high dimensions [21 – 23]. The LS-SVM regression model obtained as described above is a new, highly accurate, and economical method for predicting <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> levels <b>of</b> stone relics based on experimental spectral data from weathered materials.|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> {{feasibility}} <b>of</b> using time-domain airborne electromagnetic {{and ground}} resistivity methods in geological mapping in tropical terrains is investigated. The investigation {{is based upon}} evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> linear inverse theory in <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> physical parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weathered</b> layer necessary for interpretation of underlying lithology. Inversion of ground resistivity sounding data from the greenstone belt in western Kenya yields conductivities and thicknesses {{that are consistent with}} geology. A similar inversion of modelled time-domain airborne electromagnetic data shows that conductivity, thickness and depth to <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conductive <b>weathered</b> layer can be uniquely determined if its response does not suffer the thin sheet response problem. The results further show that this problem can be quite common in tropical regions since much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weathered</b> layer has low conductivity and thickness and, consequently, the response is weak. In this situation, conductivity and thickness are correlated and conductivity-thickness product is better determined than these two parameters independently. By virtue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weak time-domain AEM response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weathered</b> layer, much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> response remains buried in noise. This situation introduces further complications for an inverse problem that is highly non-linear. A method for reducing some of this noise before carrying out the inversion is presented...|$|R

50|$|Photooxidation {{accounts}} for most polymer failures that occur during outdoor exposure. It results from <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> solar radiation {{in combination with}} oxygen. Oxygen can promote degradation in several ways. Free radicals, formed as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cleavage <b>of</b> chemical bonds by solar radiation, react with oxygen to form peroxy radicals that initiate a series of radical chain reactions. <b>The</b> destructive effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radiation is multiplied manifold by propagation of bond breakage and <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> hydroperoxides that further absorb solar ultraviolet radiation. This cascade effect results in an auto-acceleration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> process, and may partially account for <b>the</b> general non-linearity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> response to radiant exposure.|$|R

40|$|Ultramafic {{rocks of}} New Caledonia present {{extensive}} pseudokarstic features: undulations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> profile, fractures enlarged by dissolution, dolines. Possible influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> infiltrative instability on differential weathering of ultramafic rocks in tropical climate is investigated here, {{starting from the}} Tiebaghi case for which a groundwater model is available. Infiltration instability is governed by nondimensional numbers, i. e. the Damkohler and Peclet numbers, and by the permeability contrasts between the bedrock and <b>the</b> different layers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> profile. These numbers are firstly estimated for the Tiebaghi case, and secondly a sensitivity study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> style is achieved through numerical modeling. Computations are firstly carried out without the impervious laterite cover, and then <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> this cover is considered. The characteristic time constant for weathering of peridotites is directly estimated at around 7 yrs from <b>the</b> thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> front and <b>the</b> fluid velocity. The results show that a permeability contrast of at least 100 between the most pervious layer in <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> front and bedrock and a diffusivity of chemical species lower than 2. 5 x 10 - 8 m(2) /s are required to allow instability.
