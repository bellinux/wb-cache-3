5|$|After James was deposed by William III and Mary II in the Glorious Revolution in late 1688, Massachusetts rose up in {{rebellion}} against Andros, arresting {{him and other}} dominion leaders in Boston. The revolt rapidly spread through the dominion, and the New England colonies quickly restored their pre-dominion governments. When news of the Boston revolt reached New York a week later, Nicholson took no steps to announce news <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>or</b> of the revolution in England, for fear of raising prospects of rebellion in New York. When word of the Boston revolt reached Long Island, politicians and militia leaders became more assertive, and by mid-May dominion officials had been ousted {{from a number of}} communities. At the same time, Nicholson learned that France had declared war on England, bringing the threat of French and Indian attacks on New York's northern frontier. In an attempt to mollify panicked citizenry over rumored Indian raids, Nicholson invited the militia to join the army garrison at Fort James.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} Earth's {{magnetic}} field {{is one of}} heteroscedastic fluctuation. An instantaneous measurement <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>or</b> several measurements of it across the span of decades or centuries, are not sufficient to extrapolate an overall trend in the field strength. It has gone {{up and down in}} the past for unknown reasons. Also, noting the local intensity of the dipole field (or its fluctuation) is insufficient to characterize Earth's magnetic field as a whole, as it is not strictly a dipole field. The dipole component of Earth's field can diminish even while the total magnetic field remains the same or increases.|$|E

25|$|The town grew rapidly, {{reaching}} {{a population of}} around 6,500 people and approximately 2,000 dwellings, by 1692. As land {{on which to build}} diminished, it became common practice to either fill in areas of water and build new infrastructure on top <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>or</b> simply build buildings taller. Additionally, buildings gradually became heavier as the residents adopted the brick style homes of their native England. Some urged the population to adopt the low, wooden building style of the previous Spanish inhabitants, but many refused. In the end, all of these separate factors contributed to the impending disaster.|$|E
25|$|Holy {{water is}} drunk by the {{faithful}} {{after it is}} blessed {{and it is a}} common custom for the pious to drink holy water every morning. In the monasteries of Mount Athos holy water is always drunk in conjunction with consuming antidoron. Eastern Orthodox do not typically bless themselves with holy water upon entering a church as Western Catholics do, but a quantity of holy water is often kept in a font placed in the narthex (entrance) of the church, available for anyone who would like to partake <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> to take some of it home.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{position}} of Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum (the Satmar Rebbe) in respect to whether Maharal understood the Oaths as prohibitively binding upon Jews is based primarily upon what was written in Netzach Yisrael. It is uncertain whether he considered and factored in Maharal's position in his commentary on Ketubot. (Whether {{this is due to}} his not having had access to it, not having been aware <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>or</b> having viewed the text as a forgery is unknown.) However, according to his understanding of the Maharal any violation of the Oaths is absolutely prohibited, even on pain of death.|$|E

25|$|As the Ring {{contained}} {{a large part}} of Sauron's power, it was endowed with a malevolent sentience of sorts. While separated from Sauron, the Ring would strive to return to him by manipulating its bearer to claim ownership <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>or</b> by abandoning the bearer at an opportune moment. For example, it slipped from Isildur's finger during the ambush at Gladden Fields; moments later he was killed by orcs, leaving the Ring's whereabouts unknown to Sauron's enemies. It also slipped off Gollum's finger when the time was right for it to be brought back into the world at large. Warned by Bilbo of the Ring's tendency to slip off, Frodo carried the Ring on a chain.|$|E
25|$|Many {{fish that}} exhibit biofluorescence, such as sharks, lizardfish, scorpionfish, wrasses, and flatfishes, also possess yellow intraocular filters. Yellow intraocular filters in the lenses and cornea of certain fishes {{function}} as long-pass filters, thus enabling {{the species that}} possess them to visualize and potentially exploit fluorescence to enhance visual contrast and patterns that are unseen to other fishes and predators that lack this visual specialization. Fishes that possess the necessary yellow intraocular filters for visualizing biofluorescence potentially exploit a light signal from members <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> a similar functional role. Biofluorescent patterning was especially prominent in cryptically patterned fishes possessing complex camouflage, and {{that many of these}} lineages also possess yellow long-pass intraocular filters that could enable visualization of such patterns.|$|E

I stuck to those two because I thought it would be more challenging and more fun and more of a statement to what you could do with sample alone. It is an art form. It is music.
