500|$|Breckinridge refused all {{requests}} – {{including one}} made by President Ulysses S. Grant – {{to return to}} politics, insisting, [...] "I no more feel the political excitements that marked the scenes <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>former</b> years than if I were an extinct volcano." [...] Under the terms of section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment, a two-thirds vote in each house of Congress would have been needed {{to allow him to}} hold office because he sided with the Confederacy. He never expressed interest in seeking such approval. Speaking as a private citizen in March 1870, he publicly denounced the actions of the Ku Klux Klan. In 1872, he supported passage of a state statute which successfully legalized black testimony against whites in court.|$|E
500|$|Tyndall later {{described}} his membership of these openly Neo-Nazi groups as a [...] "youthful indiscretion". He expressed {{the view that}} while he regretted his involvement in them, he was not ashamed of having done so: [...] "though some <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>former</b> beliefs were mistaken, I will never acknowledge that there was anything dishonourable about holding them." [...] As leader of the NF he continued to openly approve of Hitler's social and economic program and well as his policies of German territorial expansion. In his 1988 autobiography The Eleventh Hour, he stated that while he thought that [...] "many of [...] intentions were good ones {{and many of his}} achievements admirable", he did not think [...] "that it is right for a British movement belonging to an entirely different phase of history to model itself on the movement of Hitler".|$|E
500|$|Benbow {{signed a}} three-year lease on Sayes Court in June 1696, a house {{belonging}} to diarist John Evelyn. Six months later, Evelyn {{wrote to a}} friend complaining, [...] "I have let my house to Captain Benbow, and have the mortification of seeing everyday much <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>former</b> labours and expenses there impairing {{for want of a}} more polite tenant." [...] In January 1698, Tsar Peter of Russia arrived in London to study British shipbuilding and seamanship. He and his entourage were provided with Sayes Court to reside in during their stay by William III. The Russians spent three months in London before leaving to tour the country. Benbow promptly asked for reparations from the Treasury, {{in order to be able}} to reimburse Evelyn and recover his own losses. He complained that the Russians had caused considerable damage to his house, with [...] "much of the furniture broke, lost or destroyed". Christopher Wren was instructed to survey the property and declared it [...] "entirely ruined". Benbow lost [...] "twenty fine paintings" [...] and [...] "several fine draughts and other designs relating to the Sea" [...] from his personal property. The Treasury eventually allowed payment of £350 9s. 6d. in compensation.|$|E

500|$|Kaushik and {{his team}} taught the crew [...] "all [...] knew about hockey". In an interview, he later said that he [...] "taught him (Sahni) {{everything}} about the game, starting from how the camp is conducted, how the girls come from different backgrounds and cultures, the psychological factors involved. Also how the coach faces pressure to select girls from different states and teams". After Negi was suggested, the latter assembled a team of hockey players to train the actors. He later said that he [...] "trained the girls for six months. Waking up at 4, traveling from Kandivili to Churchgate. We would retire around 11 in the night. It was tiring. But {{we were on a}} mission ... They couldn't run; couldn't hold the hockey sticks. I ensured none of them [...] cut their nails or eyebrows (as the players do). The girls have worked very hard. I salute them". Some of the actors, such as Chitrashi, Sandia, and Raynia, were cast because they were hockey players. Rob Miller was the Sport Action Director, and worked with Negi to train the actors. About working with Khan, Negi recalled that everything was planned [...] "including the penalty stroke that SRK missed. That shot alone took us nearly 20 hours as I was keen that it should be very realistic. I took the help of a lot <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>former</b> teammates. But more importantly, it was so easy working with SRK. He is unbelievably modest and was willing to do as many re-takes as we wanted".|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to a 1975 request from the National Library for the Blind for permission {{to make use of}} The Man in the High Castle, Dick responded, [...] "I also grant you a general permission to transcribe any <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>former,</b> present or future work, so indeed you can add my name to your 'general permission' list." [...] Some of his books and stories are available in braille and other specialized formats through the NLS.|$|E

6000|$|... "Have you and Mr. Playmore ever spoken {{together}} on the subject <b>of</b> <b>my</b> husband's <b>former</b> attachment to Mrs. Beauly?" [...] I asked. [...] "Has Mr. Playmore ever told you why Eustace did not marry her, after the Trial?" ...|$|R

6000|$|HOPE. Why, I thought thus with myself: I have, by my sins, run a {{great way}} into God's book, and that my now {{reforming}} will not pay off that score; therefore I should think still, under all my present amendments, But how shall I be freed from that damnation that I have brought myself in danger <b>of,</b> by <b>my</b> <b>former</b> transgressions? ...|$|R
60|$|Warn. Good old sir, be pacified; I {{was pouring}} {{out a little}} of the dregs that I had left in me <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>former</b> service, and now they are gone, my stomach's clear of them.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I thank you, sir,' {{returned}} Mr. Littimer; 'I see my follies now, sir. I am a {{good deal}} troubled when I think of the sins <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>former</b> companions, sir; but I trust they may find forgiveness.' ...|$|E
60|$|I had {{finished}} the business now. While earnestly wishing to erase from his mind the trace <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>former</b> offence, I had stamped on that tenacious surface another and far deeper impression, I had burnt it in.|$|E
40|$|The {{advertising}} {{business is}} about ideas, creativity, and innovation. It is the DNA <b>of</b> what <b>my</b> <b>former</b> boss Ed Ney called commercial persuasion. There {{is no shortage}} of ideas, creativity, and innovation but we lack meaningful channels to share and codify innovation. Ideas and creativity sooner or later are on public display. Here is where the Journal of Advertising Research (JAR) comes into perspective. ...|$|R
6000|$|In spite <b>of</b> all <b>my</b> <b>former</b> protestations, {{the city}} {{began to take}} on the color of Henry Fuller's pessimism. My {{youthful}} faith in Chicago's future as a great literary center had faded into middle-aged doubt. One by one its writers were slipping away to Manhattan. The Midland seemed farther away from publishers than ever, [...] "The current is all against us," [...] declared Fuller.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} the {{gratification}} <b>of</b> meeting <b>my</b> <b>former</b> acquaintance, Dr. Spanning, to-day, and of being praised by one who is himself a worthy recipient of praise. He spoke very handsomely <b>of</b> <b>my</b> late tractate on the Egyptian Mysteries,--using, in fact, terms which it would not become me to repeat." [...] In uttering the last clause, Mr. Casaubon leaned over the elbow of his chair, and swayed his head up and down, apparently as a muscular outlet instead of that recapitulation which {{would not have been}} becoming.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{acknowledge}} no former {{meetings with}} any {{one in this}} country," [...] Dominey replied stiffly. [...] "I obey the orders of my Imperial master when I wipe from my mind every episode or reminiscence <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>former</b> days." ...|$|E

60|$|Many {{memories}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>former</b> {{visit to}} the islands came up in my mind while we lay at anchor in front of Honolulu that night. And pictures--pictures pictures--an enchanting procession of them! I was impatient for the morning to come.|$|E
60|$|As I {{made no move}} {{to reach}} the food, the torturers left the light turned on in the hope that at last I could refrain no longer from giving them the delicious thrill <b>of</b> {{enjoyment}} that <b>my</b> <b>former</b> futile efforts to obtain it had caused.|$|R
6000|$|I {{reasoned}} with myself. I reminded myself <b>of</b> <b>my</b> few <b>former</b> ventures.

I felt that if [...] "Mrs. Waller" [...] won and I had nothing on her, I should reproach myself to my dying day.|$|R
60|$|Our {{trip through}} the earth's crust was but a {{repetition}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> two <b>former</b> journeys between the inner and the outer worlds. This time, however, I imagine that we must have maintained a more nearly perpendicular course, for we accomplished the journey in a few minutes' less time than upon the occasion <b>of</b> <b>my</b> first journey through the five-hundred-mile crust. Just a trifle less than seventy-two hours after our departure into the sands of the Sahara, we broke through the surface of Pellucidar.|$|R
6000|$|Meantime, {{as it is}} {{impossible}} to return to Central Europe, I expect to open either a fruit store or a peanut stand very shortly in this great metropolis. I imagine that many <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>former</b> colleagues will soon be doing the same! ...|$|E
60|$|I {{recalled}} the last phases <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>former</b> life, that darkling climax of pursuit and anger and universal darkness and the whirling green vapors of extinction. The comet had struck {{the earth and}} made an end to all things; of that too I was assured.|$|E
6000|$|... "I fear I cannot {{become a}} good MAN again," [...] said Ugu, [...] "for the {{transformation}} I am under will always {{keep me in}} the form of a dove.

60|$|With {{those few}} minutes of interruption, {{the time for the}} {{disclosure}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> secret had passed by. As soon as my sister was out <b>of</b> the room, <b>my</b> <b>former</b> reluctance to trust it to home-keeping returned, and remained unchanged throughout the whole of the long year's probation which I had engaged to pass. But this mattered little. As events turned out, if I had told Clara all, the end would have come in the same way, the fatality would have been accomplished by the same means.|$|R
40|$|To {{eye care}} practitioners, {{citation}} metrics {{may seem to}} be a somewhat esoteric and irrelevant concept, far removed from the realities or real world, day-to-day clinical practice.

60|$|Remember, sirrahs, {{that there}} are but nine days between the dates <b>of</b> <b>my</b> two <b>former</b> letters. I sent away my twentieth this moment, and now am writing on like a fish, as if nothing was done. But there was a cause for my hasting away the last, for fear it should not come time enough before a new quarter began. I told you where I dined to-day; but {{forgot to tell you}} what I believe, that Mr. Harley will be Lord Treasurer in a short time, and other great removes and {{promotions}} made. This is my thought, etc.|$|R
