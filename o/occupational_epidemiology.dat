5000|$|<b>Occupational</b> <b>{{epidemiology}}</b> {{is one of}} the sub-disciplines {{of epidemiology}} that focus on investigations on workers and the workplace. Occupational epidemiologic studies examine a variety of health outcomes among workers and their potential association with a variety of conditions in the workplace (such as noise, chemicals, heat, radiation, etc.) or work organization (schedules, etc.). The need for evidence to inform occupational safety regulations, workers' compensation programs, and federal safety legislation constituted part of the motivation for the development of public health policy, <b>occupational</b> <b>epidemiology</b> methods, surveillance mechanisms and the delineation of the scope of this area of knowledge. [...] Occupational epidemiological research can inform risk assessments; development of standards and other risk management activities; and estimates of the co-benefits and co-harms of policies designed to reduce risk factors or conditions that can affect human health. <b>Occupational</b> <b>epidemiology</b> methods are common to methods used in environmental epidemiology.|$|E

50|$|Occupational {{health risks}} were {{initially}} observed by case series reports of apparent disease excesses or clusters.

50|$|Environmental {{epidemiology}} is {{a branch}} of epidemiology concerned {{with the discovery of}} the environmental exposures that contribute to or protect against injuries, illnesses, developmental conditions, disabilities, and deaths; and identification of public health and health care actions to manage the risks associated with harmful exposures.

These factors may be naturally occurring or may be introduced into environments where people live, work, and play. Environmental exposures are involuntary and thus generally exclude occupational exposures (covered by <b>occupational</b> <b>epidemiology)</b> and voluntary exposures such as active smoking, medications, and diet.|$|E
