5|$|The {{government}} set up {{a second}} committee in 1968 who suggested that the old eastwest runway be closed and the airport's area reduced, allowing for development to the east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport.</b> They suggested that this {{is replaced by a}} new runway in the sea, adjacent to the beach. The runway was closed, and a high density upper-middle income neighborhood was built to the east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport,</b> although the new runway was never constructed due to the high cost involved.|$|E
5|$|To {{expand the}} blast radius for {{ammunitions}} testing at Fort Custer, MDOT rerouted the BL I-94/M-37 to {{run along the}} southern and eastern edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> in Battle Creek instead of following roads on the opposite sides. This change was completed in 2015.|$|E

The investigation further determined the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and officials at DeKalb–Peachtree Airport were aware of the danger of birds at the airport after a landfill site had opened in the vicinity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> ten years before the accident.|$|E
5|$|After a {{telephone}} discussion with a Casper weather briefer, Reid {{decided to take}} off despite the worsening conditions at the airport, {{and to try to}} escape the poor weather by turning immediately eastward.

In 1973 the newly created Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority (MNAA) finalized a master plan to coordinate the long-term growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> along projected increases in needed passenger capacity.

Also, during the war, the government established a government-owned aviation factory on the grounds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> known as Air Force Factory 85, eventually operated by North American Aviation.
