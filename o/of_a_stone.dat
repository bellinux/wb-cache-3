5|$|French and Indian raids had resumed in {{the years}} {{following}} Phips' 1690 expeditions, so he sought to improve the province's defenses. Pursuant to his instructions from London, in 1692 he oversaw the construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> fort, which was dubbed Fort William Henry, at Pemaquid (present-day Bristol, Maine), where a wooden fort had been destroyed in 1689. He recruited Major Benjamin Church to lead a 450-man expedition eventually leading to a tenuous peace agreement with the Abenaki people.|$|E
5|$|Northampton's is a {{comparatively}} elaborate war memorial, {{especially for a}} town rather than a city. It consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Stone</b> of Remembrance flanked by tall twin obelisks, each adorned {{with a pair of}} painted stone flags. Its use of obelisks, a Stone of Remembrance, and painted flags—all features characteristic of Lutyens' war memorials—make it particularly significant among his works.|$|E

By the results of laboratory tests on a fresh acidic tuff with the same rock <b>of</b> <b>a</b> halo <b>stone</b> Buddha, average absorption, average P-wave velocity, and average uniaxial compressive strength were 5. 38 %, 4, 008 m/s, and 70. 1 MPa, respectively. The results correspond to moderately strong rock. Average P-wave velocity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> halo <b>stone</b> Buddha measured by the low frequency flaw detector was 2, 257 m/s in the left zone, 3, 437 m/s in the right zone, and 2, 802 m/s overall.

5|$|Ten more {{missions}} {{were founded}} in the Chiquitania by the Jesuits in three periods: the 1690s, the 1720s, and after 1748. In the 1690s, five missions were established: San Rafael de Velasco (1696), San José de Chiquitos (1698), Concepción (1699) and San Juan Bautista (1699). San Juan Bautista {{is not part of}} the World Heritage Site, and only the ruins <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> tower survive near the present village of (San Juan de) Taperas.|$|E
5|$|The Bow Back Rivers cross an area {{originally}} {{known as}} Stratford Marsh, {{an area of}} common Lammas land, where inhabitants had common rights to graze horses and cattle between Lammas Day (1 August) and Lady Day (25 March), but which was used for growing hay {{for the rest of}} the year. The Marsh was between Stratford-Langthorne and Stratford-at-Bow. Little remains from pre-history, but the names suggest that the two settlements lay at either end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> causeway across the marsh. Remains <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> causeway have been found, but no traces of an associated road. The ford at Old Ford is of pre-Roman origin, part of a route from London to Essex which crossed Bethnal Green. In the Roman era, a new road was built from London to the ford, which carried the principal road to Colchester. There may also have been a ford further south at Bow, and a further causeway existed between Homerton and Leyton, known as Wanstead Slip.|$|E
5|$|The dome, {{octagonal}} in shape, stands prominently {{on top of}} {{the centre}} of the cella. It was supported by four now-destroyed columns which were located directly beneath it. The integrated bell tower has been built {{on top of the}} narthex, as was customary in contemporary Byzantine church architecture, and extends from the rectangular main structure. The bell tower was originally rectangular, though it is now partially ruined. It was reached from the south by means <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> staircase.|$|E

5|$|Between 1111 and 1117 {{the ancient}} clas church was granted by Gilbert fitz Richard to St Peter's Abbey, Gloucester (a Benedictine house), as a cell or priory of St Peter's Abbey. This may have meant the {{construction}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> church, {{perhaps the first}} on the site; a new tower and porch were built. It {{is not clear whether}} the Celtic monks and priests (married and single) were expelled, or whether they were joined by brethren of a new sort. A few years later, in 1141, Ewenny Priory, in the Vale of Glamorgan, was founded as a priory of St Peter's Abbey, Gloucester. As with Llanbadarn, there was a pre-existing church, in this case definitely one in stone, and probably dating from the 1120s, as it was consecrated 1126 by Bishop Urban of Llandaff.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} Saxon and early medieval period {{there were at}} least four {{buildings}} on the summit. The base <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> cross demonstrates Christian use of the site during this period and {{it may have been a}} hermitage. The broken head of a wheel cross dated to the 10th or 11th centuries was found part way down the hill and may have been the head of the cross that stood on the summit. The head of the cross is now in the Museum of Somerset in Taunton.|$|E
5|$|In its {{earliest}} form, the castle consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> keep, with an enclosure protected by an earthen bank and a wooden palisade. When the castle was built, Robert de Vieuxpont {{was one of}} the only few lords in the region who were loyal to King John. The Vieuxponts were a powerful land-owning family in North West England, who also owned the castles of Appleby and Brough. In 1264, Robert de Vieuxpont's grandson, also named Robert, was declared a traitor, and his property was confiscated by HenryIII. Brougham Castle and the other estates were eventually returned to the Vieuxpont family, and stayed in their possession, until 1269, when the estates passed to the Clifford family through marriage.|$|E

5|$|Kraków's {{early history}} begins with {{evidence}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Stone</b> Age settlement {{on the present}} site of the Wawel Hill. A legend attributes Kraków's founding to the mythical ruler Krakus, who built it above a cave occupied by a dragon, Smok Wawelski. The first written record of the city's name dates back to 965, when Kraków {{was described as a}} notable commercial centre controlled first by Moravia (876–879), but captured by a Bohemian duke Boleslaus I in 955. The first acclaimed ruler of Poland, Mieszko I, took Kraków from the Bohemians and incorporated it into the holdings of the Piast dynasty towards the end of his reign.|$|E
5|$|Many {{art objects}} were {{produced}} in Northern China {{during the time}} of the Northern Celestial Masters. These objects were closely modeled on Buddhist designs. The image of the god (usually Laozi), would be carved on the front side <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> stele, with inscriptions on the back or side of the carving. The inscriptions were usually prayers to the dead, a wish for the happiness of family members or wishes for political peace. The iconography and contents of the inscriptions show that a close relationship between Daoism and Buddhism existed in the Northern Wei state. This relationship is especially evident in some four-sided stelae that had carvings of both Laozi on two sides and the Buddha on the other two.|$|E
5|$|Structure E4 is a {{platform}} located behind Pyramid E1 and encloses {{the eastern side}} of the Group E plaza. It faces west onto the plaza and has two access stairways, both flanked by ramps built from small slabs of stone and with cornices at the top. The platform walls are of fine workmanship, being built with well-cut and carefully fitted pumice. The front portion of the upper platform was paved with stone slabs, and a bench ran the entire length of the back of the platform. The clay floor between the paving and the bench was found to have been burnt. An offering was excavated from the central axis of the platform's base, it consisted of two ring-shaped clubs placed on either side <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> ball.|$|E

5|$|The first Ambassador of Russia to Austria was Prince Dmitry Mikhailovich Golitsyn and {{he served}} in this {{position}} from 1763 until 1792. Gallitzinstraße, the street where his ambassadorial villa was located is named after him. In 1792 Count Andrey Kirillovich Razumovsky became ambassador in Vienna, where he kept contact {{with representatives of the}} European aristocracy, politicians and artists. While in Vienna, he built the Palais Rasumofsky, and also financed construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> bridge across the Danube. As a patron of the arts, Razumovsky established an art gallery, and commissioned Beethoven to compose the famous Razumovsky string quartets.|$|E
5|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{has been}} threatened by erosion for decades. In the 1930s, {{as a response}} to the erosion, a breakwater was constructed to protect the boat landing area. In 1996, the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation and the National Trust for Historic Preservation assisted the task of obtaining funding for a $4.5 million erosion-control project. The funds were approved in 1998 with the help of Connecticut Senators, Joseph Lieberman and Christopher Dodd and New Haven's Congressional Representative Rosa DeLauro. In 2001, the construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> wall and creation of a buffer zone was completed. The second phase of the project calls for protective revetment on the south side of the island.|$|E
5|$|To {{the south}} of the church there are the {{remnants}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> preaching cross. The cross was originally situated on Poulton's boundary and marked a resting place for mourners travelling long distances to bury corpses at St Chad's. Only the two circular steps into which the original structure was set remain; the cross shaft has been replaced by an octagonal pillar. The pillar was used as a sundial until the early 20th century when the gnomon was stolen. The steps function as a memorial for present-day mourners at St Chad's, in a small garden of remembrance. The churchyard is noted locally for its display of crocuses and other flowering bulbs in early springtime.|$|E
