30|$|If Basu {{seeks to}} incorporate, in this manner, <b>the</b> Christian {{doctrine}} <b>of</b> creation ex nihilo within <b>the</b> Vedantic understanding <b>of</b> divine causality, he elsewhere systematically distances Christian understandings, perceptions, and experiences from <b>the</b> dhārmika life-worlds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hindus.</b> First, {{he argues that}} <b>the</b> attainment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goal <b>of</b> Brahman requires a self-control and spiritual discipline which is so arduous that only <b>the</b> <b>Hindus,</b> because they have unlimited strength, courage, and patience, can embark on this path. <b>The</b> other peoples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, in comparison to <b>the</b> <b>Hindus,</b> are but children in <b>the</b> matters <b>of</b> spirituality and mental strength (ādhyātmikatāẏa o mānasika bale pṛṭhibīte tāhāra samāna keha nāi – tāhāra tulanäýa sakalei bālaka). Europeans and Americans, for instance, are overcome with fear when they hear about the harsh (kaṭhora) spiritual path <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hindus</b> (H, 24). <b>The</b> inner sternness (kaṭhinatā) with which <b>the</b> <b>Hindus</b> are able to endure great difficulties as they advance spiritually is indeed one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> Hindutva (H, 26). Basu concedes that the fatalism that some Europeans have attributed to Hindus is not completely misplaced; however, even this ‘fatalistic’ resignation should be properly understood as a mark <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deep spirituality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hindus.</b> While in <b>the</b> acquisition <b>of</b> worldly goods Hindus indeed often resign themselves to <b>the</b> operations <b>of</b> their karmic deserts, they do not adopt such an attitude in matters relating to their spiritual welfare (H, 71 – 73). Thus, Hindutva provides an early elaboration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ‘spiritual East’ versus ‘materialistic Europe’ binary. Basu argues that the Europeans have not progressed far on <b>the</b> road <b>of</b> spiritual progress (ādhyātmika unnati), whereas <b>the</b> <b>Hindus</b> have, in contrast, made little progress in worldly matters. Whereas even an ordinary individual in Europe is materially wealthier than a landlord in India, an ordinary Hindu is equal to great Europeans in <b>the</b> matters <b>of</b> knowing dharma and following dharma (H, 85). A natural love <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eternal (prakṛta nityapriyatā), Basu writes, is a characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dharma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hindus</b> (H, 113).|$|R
