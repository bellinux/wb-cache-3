5|$|Jemima {{tells her}} life story to Maria and Darnford, {{explaining}} {{that she was}} born a bastard. Jemima's mother died {{while she was still}} an infant, making her already precarious social position worse. She was therefore forced to become a servant in her father's house and later bound out as an apprentice to a master who beat her, starved her, and raped her. When the man's wife discovers that Jemima is pregnant with his child, she is thrown out of the house. Unable to support herself, she aborts her child and becomes a prostitute. She becomes the kept woman of a man of some wealth who seems obsessed with pleasure of every kind: food, love, etc. After the death <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gentleman</b> keeping her, she becomes an attendant at the asylum where Maria is imprisoned.|$|E

25|$|On 11 May 1509 Mary Scrope's first husband, Edward Jerningham, was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gentleman</b> ushers at {{the funeral}} of King Henry VII, and Mary herself, as 'Mrs Jerningham', was among the ladies granted mantlets and kerchiefs for the funeral.

25|$|An {{indictment}} {{heard before}} the Court of Kings Bench in 1387 accused 3 persons of holding conventicles at Earlswood in the lordship of Lydney {{in order to}} plot the killing of Sir Gilbert Denys and John Poleyn. The 3 accused were Ralph Greyndour the younger, John Magot and John Chaunterell. Greyndour {{was an example of}} the curious mediaeval phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gentleman</b> bandit. The Greyndour clan dominated the sparsely populated and wild area of the Forest of Dean in western Gloucestershire bordering on the Welsh Marches. Ralph's kinsman was John Greyndour, lord of Mitcheldean, Littledean and Abenhall, all within the Forest of Dean. These 3 were also accused of plotting to kill Henry Warner, Nicholas More and Thomas de Berkeley of Berkeley when the latter came hunting in the forest with the king's licence. All 3 were acquitted of the charges.|$|E
5|$|Without speech, the Scoobies {{resort to}} {{gestures}} or writing. Humorous misperceptions arise from this gesturing when, for example, Buffy mimes driving in a stake—as though killing a vampire—too {{close to her}} pelvis, causing the Scoobies to think she is suggesting masturbating to rid <b>the</b> town <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Gentlemen.</b> In <b>the</b> belfry, while Buffy and Riley are fighting <b>The</b> <b>Gentlemen,</b> Buffy indicates that Riley should smash the box from her dream. He misunderstands and breaks a jar beside it, looks up and grins, awaiting Buffy's approval. <b>The</b> clumsiness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characters' gesturing is in direct contrast to <b>the</b> grace <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Gentlemen,</b> who communicate easily through gestures and other visual signals. Their communication is simple and direct; nods, head tilts, and hand movements, achieve exactly what they want it to. The Scoobies, however, are confused and accomplish <b>the</b> opposite <b>of</b> what they intend. When they are rendered silent they are also rendered useless, unsure of how to fight <b>The</b> <b>Gentlemen.</b> According to two Buffy essayists, part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horror stemming from <b>the</b> arrival <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Gentlemen</b> is <b>the</b> silence that makes <b>the</b> people <b>of</b> Sunnydale helpless, easy victims.|$|R

25|$|Beside its {{historical}} value, Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư is also considered an important {{work of the}} literature of Vietnam because Ngô Sĩ Liên often provided {{more information about the}} mentioned historical figures by the additional stories which were well written like a literary work.

25|$|Bunin and Muromtseva {{spent three}} winters (1912–1914) with Gorky {{on the island}} of Capri, where they met with Fyodor Shalyapin and Leonid Andreev, among others. In Russia the couple divided their time mainly between Moscow and a Bunin family estate at Glotovo village nearby Oryol; it was there that they spent the first couple years of World War I. Dogged by anxieties {{concerning}} Russia's future, Bunin was still working hard. In the winter of 1914–1915 he finished a new volume of prose and verse entitled The Chalice of Life (Чаша жизни), published in early 1915 to wide acclaim (including high praise from the French poet Rene Ghil). The same year saw the publication <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Gentleman</b> from San Francisco (Господин из Сан-Франциско), arguably the best-known of Bunin's short stories, which was translated into English by D. H. Lawrence. Bunin was a productive translator himself. After Longfellow's The Song of Hiawatha (1898) he did translations of Byron, Tennyson, Musset and François Coppée.|$|E
500|$|Ne-Yo's third album, Year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gentleman,</b> was {{released}} internationally on August 5, 2008. Speaking to noted UK R writer Pete Lewis of the award-winning Blues & Soul, Ne-Yo explained the thinking behind its title: [...] "To me Year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gentleman</b> {{is all about}} a persona, a swag and a charm. I made {{an assessment of the}} music business. And, in my personal opinion, the essence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gentleman</b> is absent right now. Everybody kinda looks the same, everybody's kinda doing the same thing, everybody's kinda rude and full of themselves. Whereas a gentleman is calm, courteous, kind, charming... So that title basically represents me trying to lead by example, and showing these cats {{what it is to be}} a gentleman in this business still." ...|$|E
