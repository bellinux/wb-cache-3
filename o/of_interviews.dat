40|$|The {{second edition}} of this {{landmark}} volume emphasizes the dynamic, interactional, and reflexive dimensions <b>of</b> the research <b>interview.</b> Contributors highlight the myriad dimensions of complexity that are emerging as researchers increasingly frame the interview as a communicative opportunity {{as much as}} a data-gathering format. The book begins with an overview of the history and conceptual transformations <b>of</b> the <b>interview,</b> which is followed by chapters that discuss the main components <b>of</b> <b>interview</b> practice. Taken together, the contributions to the handbook encourage readers to simultaneously learn the frameworks and technologies <b>of</b> <b>interviewing</b> and reflect on the epistemological foundations <b>of</b> the <b>interview</b> craft.

5|$|A {{research}} team undertook {{a study in}} 2016 to understand the appeal behind Mercury's voice. Led by Professor Christian Herbst, the team identified his notably faster vibrato and use of subharmonics as unique characteristics of Mercury's voice, particularly in comparison to opera singers, and confirmed a vocal range from F#2 to G5 (just over 3 octaves) but were unable to confirm claims of a 4-octave range. The {{research team}} studied vocal samples from 23 commercially available Queen recordings, his solo work, and a series <b>of</b> <b>interviews</b> of the late artist. They also used an endoscopic video camera to study a rock singer brought in to imitate Mercury's singing voice.|$|E

In this paper we examine traditional genres and hybrid forms <b>of</b> broadcast <b>interviewing</b> using a visual text analytic software Discursis (Angus et al., 2013, Angus et al., 2012 a and Angus et al., 2012 b).

50|$|Research has {{identified}} five dimensions <b>of</b> <b>interview</b> anxiety: communication anxiety, social anxiety, performance anxiety, behavioral anxiety and appearance anxiety. Further {{research shows that}} both the interviewer and applicant agree that speaking slowly is a clear sign <b>of</b> <b>interview</b> anxiety. However, they do not agree on other anxiety indicators such as frequent pauses and biting or licking of lips. Trait judgments are also related to interview anxiety and can affect interviewer perceptions of anxiety. Low assertiveness {{has been identified as}} the key trait related to interview anxiety. Thus, the most important indicators <b>of</b> <b>interview</b> anxiety are slow speech rate and low assertiveness.|$|R
