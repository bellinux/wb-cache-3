2500|$|An Associated Press {{investigation}} {{published in}} December 2016 found that [...] "instead of fighting hunger, {{the military is}} making money from it".

One anonymous businessman {{who participated in the}} lucrative food dealings with Bolivarian military officials and was contracted $131 million between 2012 and 2015 showed the Associated Press his accounts surrounding business in Venezuela. The Bolivarian government would contract the businessman for more than double the actual cost for products, for example one corn contract of $52 million being $20 million more than the market average, and then the businessman would have to use such money to pay Bolivarian military personnel to import such products. The businessman stated that he had been paying millions of dollars to military officials for years and that the Bolivarian food minister, Gen. Rodolfo Marco Torres, once had to be paid $8 million just to import goods into Venezuela. Documents seen by the Associated Press showing prices for corn also revealed that the Bolivarian government budgeted $118 million in July 2016, an <b>overpayment</b> of $50 million for average market prices for that month.|$|E

[...] This includes the predator's own shareholders, investors, government and the public. [...] "The effects of predatory lenders and the subprime mortgage market on these constituencies and the financial markets include: 1) devaluing of various mortgage derivative products; 2) failure of major banks and Wall Street firms; 3) reluctance of corporations, mutual funds and other investors to invest in legitimate mortgage backed securities; 4) increased government regulation and supervision; 5) illegal stripping of equity of customer's homes; 6) outcries from shareholders and constituents; 7) credit downgrading of mortgage backed securities; 8) reduced value and marketability of mortgage backed securities; 9) reduced stock and option prices; 10) elimination of jobs due to cuts and layoffs; 11) <b>overpayment</b> of false and fraudulent claims by federal government; and 12) increase in foreclosed and abandoned homes in communities across America."

[...] In a February 1821 review for the British Critic, John Taylor Coleridge attacked the poem again for a heretical view found {{in the notion of}} pre-existence and how it reappeared in Wordsworth's poem [...] "On an Extraordinary Evening of Splendour and Beauty". However, he does claim that the passage of the ode containing the idea is [...] "a passage of exquisite poetry" [...] and that [...] "A more poetical theory of human nature cannot well be devised, and if the subject were one, upon which error was safe, we should forbear to examine it closely, and yield to the delight we have often received from it in the ode from which the last extract [...] is made." [...] He was to continue: [...] "If, therefore, we had met the doctrine in any poet but Mr. Wordsworth, we should have said nothing; but we believe him to be one not willing to promulgate error, even in poetry, indeed it is manifest that he makes his poetry subservient to his philosophy; and this particular notion is so mixed up by him with others, in which it is impossible to suppose him otherwise than serious; that we are constrained to take it for his real and sober belief." ...|$|E
