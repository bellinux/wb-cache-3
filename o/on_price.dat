5|$|The advent in {{the mid-1990s}} of ’no-frills’ carriers, such as easyJet, has had a {{significant}} impact on air travel in the UK. In 2005 these airlines carried 77.5million passengers, up from just 4.3million in 1996. They are responsible for the growth of regional airports, operating from 35 airports in 2006 compared to 10 in 1996, and increasing the choice of international destinations, serving 150 in 2006, compared to 12 a decade earlier. The annual rate of growth in the overall demand for air travel has remained stable since 1975, averaging 5.8 per cent annually. Recent growth is being serviced by the no-frills airlines at the expense of traditional carriers which, since 2000, have experienced flat or declining traffic levels. In response, traditional carriers have lowered costs to compete more effectively <b>on</b> <b>price,</b> leading to lower prices on the short haul routes serviced by this sector, especially in business fares. They have also limited or reduced capacity and in some cases launched no-frills subsidiaries of their own.|$|E
5|$|In {{his book}} which {{presented}} {{the model to}} the general public, Paul Krugman used {{the example of the}} aircraft industry, with the two players being Airbus and Boeing. In fact, Krugman and Baldwin examined the industry for wide bodied aircraft {{in the context of the}} model in a 1988 paper. The authors calibrate an extended version of the model in order to examine the effect of a subsidy to Airbus by European governments, and its presence in a market which can only support two firms at most, worldwide. They find that the subsidy had an unambiguously negative effect on welfare of the United States and a positive effect on rest of the world, which benefits from lower prices. The result for Europe hinges <b>on</b> <b>price</b> elasticity of demand; for relatively inelastic demand the net effect of subsidy is positive with most of the benefits accruing to European consumers, but for elastic demand, social welfare in Europe goes down. Importantly, unlike in the baseline Brander and Spencer model, Krugman and Baldwin find that the changes to consumer surplus resulting from the subsidy and entry, dominate the effect of changes in firm profits in social welfare calculations.|$|E

25|$|Most {{charges of}} {{discrimination}} based <b>on</b> <b>price</b> {{are difficult to}} verify, without significant documentation.

Furthermore, while a number of monitoring services and consumer interest groups take an interest in this form of discrimination, there is very little they can do to change it. Most discrimination based <b>on</b> <b>price</b> occurs in situations without a standardized price list that can be compared against. In the cases of per diem charges, this is easily concealed as few consumers can exchange estimates and work rates, and even if they do the business in question can claim that the services provided had different baseline costs, conditions, etc.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of {{competition}} <b>on</b> <b>prices</b> <b>on</b> a health care market where prices are market determined; the Swedish market for dental care. The paper adds to the literature by addressing the empirical challenge of identifying {{the effect of}} competition <b>on</b> <b>prices.</b> The empirical strategy exploits {{that the effect of}} competition differs across services, depending on the characteristics of the service. Price competition is theoretically more intense for services such as examinations and diagnostics (first-stage services), compared to more complicated and unusual treatments (follow-on services). This is because consumers are better informed and thus more price sensitive with respect to first-stage services and face costs for switching once they have chosen a provider. By exploiting this difference, I identify a relative effect of competition <b>on</b> <b>prices.</b> The results suggest small but statistically significant negative effects <b>on</b> <b>prices</b> for first-stage services relative to follow-on services. A 1 % increase in competition from one year to the next is followed by an increase in the price difference in the range 0. 0089 % to 0. 017 %. These are short-term effects and provide evidence of strategic behavior of clinics. Hence, substantial effects of competition <b>on</b> <b>prices</b> over time cannot be ruled out. Policy simulations suggest that the absolute effect of competition <b>on</b> <b>prices</b> is in the range - 0. 01 % to - 0. 09 %. Thus, the policy simulations suggest that there is room for price decreases in the Swedish market for dental care and that increased competition would be welfare enhancing...|$|R

30|$|Price {{processes}} are modeled to have continuously compounded returns given by locally bilateral gamma processes with zero covariations between them. It is observed that covariances can arise at specific horizons only if integrated variations are stochastic. This observation suggests that perhaps variations are Markovian and functionally dependent <b>on</b> the <b>price</b> processes themselves. Anticipating {{the absence of}} such dependence except when price relativities are strained leads to the conjecture that the dependencies must be nonlinear. For stylized models with a known nonlinear dependence, it is verified that support vector machine regressions are capable of detecting the prevailing nonlinearity. For variations to depend <b>on</b> <b>prices,</b> the parameters of the underlying bilateral gamma process should depend <b>on</b> <b>prices.</b> Support vector machine regressions are then employed to model parameter variations as depending nonlinearly <b>on</b> <b>prices.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{exploits}} {{the unexpected}} arrival of 200, 000 FSU immigrants to Israel during 1990 to empirically examine {{the effect of}} a change in demand <b>on</b> <b>prices.</b> The main finding is that immigration had a moderating effect <b>on</b> <b>prices</b> during 1990. Controlling for the selection of immigrants into cities and for population growth, a 1 percentage point increase in the share of immigrants in a city decreases prices by about 1. 4 - 1. 8 percent. Even when the increase in population is accounted for, the overall effect of immigration <b>on</b> <b>prices</b> remains negative. This downward effect <b>on</b> <b>prices</b> is stronger in products where demand increases are larger. The negative immigration effect {{can be explained by the}} new immigrants searching more intensively for lower prices than the native population. In support of this interpretation, it is shown that the relationship between price dispersion across stores and the share of immigrants has an inverse-U shape as implied by Stahl's (1989) model of search. ...|$|R
