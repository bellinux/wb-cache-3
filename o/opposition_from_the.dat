5|$|After a {{temporary}} period {{of research at}} the London School of Economics in England, Chen was appointed the Deputy Secretary-General of the Presidential Office in February 2007.

Chen served with Lin Chia-lung, former director of the Government Information Office.|$|E

5|$|Alison Redford {{subsequently}} {{was elected}} party leader {{and became the}} first female Premier of Alberta. Despite strong <b>opposition</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Wildrose Party that most polls and media predicted would end the PC's 41-year dynasty, Redford and the PC party won re-election in April 2012, making Redford Alberta's first elected female premier. Due to a steep decline in approval ratings and a spending controversy, Alison Redford announced her resignation on March 19, 2014, as premier of Alberta, effective March 23.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, {{plans for}} a HIAG {{convention}} in Göttingen faced strong <b>opposition</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> local Social Democratic Party (SPD), the Jewish Council, the Students' Association and the University hierarchy. Federal government officials intervened, and the event was first postponed and then scaled down to a much smaller meeting lacking the qualities of a political event.|$|E
5|$|In July 2010, Conroy delayed {{implementing}} the plan pending a 12-month review into how refused classification content was rated.

Internet service providers Telstra and Optus have both agreed to voluntarily block some content.|$|E
5000|$|... 1994-onwards: {{a system}} in which the three central parties (the {{conservative}} EPP, the socialist PES and the liberal ELDR) have voted as much with each other as with their smaller allies, thus 'governing' the system, and facing different <b>oppositions</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> left (European Left and Greens and leftist euroskeptics) and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> right (Gaullists, British Conservatives, rightist euroskeptics and nationalists).|$|R

5|$|In the 1964 Government led by Harold Wilson, Benn was Postmaster General, {{where he}} oversaw {{the opening of}} the Post Office Tower, then the UK's tallest building, and the creations of the Post Bus service and Girobank. He {{proposed}} issuing stamps without the Sovereign's head, but this met with private <b>opposition</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Queen. Instead, the portrait was reduced to a small profile in silhouette, a format that is still used on commemorative stamps.|$|E
5|$|The {{marketing}} and trademark of Dota as a franchise by Valve gained concern and <b>opposition</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> DotA Allstars contributors working at Riot Games, {{as well as}} Blizzard Entertainment, both of which legally opposed the franchising of Dota by Valve. The legal dispute was conceded in May 2012, with Valve gaining undisputed franchising rights for commercial use to the trademark, while non-commercial use remains open to the public. Dota 2 was officially released in July 2013.|$|E
5|$|After the conference, Campbell flew to New York with Callen, Berkowitz and Artie Felson, {{organizing}} {{and planning for}} local and national PWA organizations on the plane. On arrival, they organized a PWA organization in the city despite initial <b>opposition</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Gay Men's Health Crisis. They also planned a national PWA organization which opened in New York City in June 1984. PWA-New York went on to create the first safer sex poster to appear in a gay bathhouse in the city.|$|E

5|$|After traffic issues {{during the}} 2008 {{reconstruction}} {{work on the}} Wheeling Tunnel, local politicians suggested closing the twin tunnels altogether and building the freeway over Wheeling Hill instead. After <b>opposition</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which represented the affected Wheeling Hill residents, the suggestions were dropped. The cost of completing the tunnel replacement project was estimated at between $60 and $80million. The total $13.7million cost of the tunnel reconstruction project was over double the original bid of $5.7million, {{due in part to}} the work delays.|$|E
5|$|As Upper Canada's administrator, Brock made {{a series}} of changes to prepare for war. He amended the militia act to allow use of all {{available}} volunteers and ordered enhanced training of these raw recruits, despite <b>opposition</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> provincial legislature. He continued strengthening and reinforcing defences. Brock also began seeking out First Nations leaders, such as the Shawnee chief Tecumseh, to build alliances with him against the Americans in the event of war. Although the conventional wisdom of the day was that Canada would fall quickly {{in the event of an}} invasion, Brock pursued these strategies to give the colony a fighting chance.|$|E
5|$|But, after {{assessing}} {{the situation in}} Alsace, Julian evidently decided that his force was insufficient to prevail over the Alamanni alone. Instead, {{he set out to}} recover Cologne. From Metz, he led his army via Treviri (Trier) to Roman-held Koblenz and thence along the Rhine to Cologne. Entering the ruined city unopposed, Julian's men were set to work to rebuild the city walls. Julian then concluded a peace treaty with the Franks. This had the important result of removing half the <b>opposition</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> equation and allowing Julian to focus his resources on dealing with the Alamanni.|$|E

5|$|By 1795, the {{original}} Bridgewater Canal from Worsley to Manchester had proved an economic success, prompting its owner, Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, to seek powers to extend it route to Leigh via Astley. The Duke's plans were approved, despite <b>opposition</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> local population. Canal traffic brought trade to Astley Green where the Hope and Anchor Inn (now the Boathouse) was built with stabling for horses that pulled the barges. The original canal bridge built to connect Lower and Higher Green lasted until 1904, {{when it was}} replaced. The second bridge was replaced in 1920 by an iron bridge, which could be raised to counter the effects of mining subsidence. A boatyard was established by Lingards Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began on}} 16 March 2005 when Sonia Gandhi laid the {{foundation}} stone. Two days prior, the Central Government had named the airport after former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who had undergone pilot training in Hyderabad. The naming resulted in <b>opposition</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Telugu Desam Party (TDP). At Begumpet Airport, the international terminal was named after Rajiv Gandhi while the domestic terminal was named after TDP founder N. T. Rama Rao; the TDP wanted to continue this naming convention at the new airport. However, the new airport has only one terminal.|$|E
5|$|Delays {{in finding}} the funding, <b>opposition</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> two {{mainline}} companies that the line was intended to connect, and World War I, led {{to the start of}} construction work being delayed until 1927. The line was completed and opened in January 1930, although the planned extension of the DR was not implemented and the service was provided by the Southern Railway. The opening of the line stimulated residential development as planned, but competition from the London Underground's City and South London Railway, which had its terminus at Morden, meant that the line did not achieve the hoped-for passenger numbers.|$|E

5|$|Despite <b>opposition</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Knights of Labor who {{eventually}} became supporters, on January 23, 1883 the Minneapolis Board of Trade passed resolutions to secure legislation {{to create a}} Board of Park Commissioners, and the city ratified a Park Act on April 3, 1883. Loring was the natural choice and was appointed the commission's first president. He was reelected each term and served until 1890 when he insisted on resigning because a property in which he held financial interest was under park board consideration.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, the EU {{directive}} 80/181/EEC had required that dual unit labelling of goods sold within the EU cease by the end of 2009. This was backed up by requests from other nations including Japan and New Zealand to permit metric-only labelling as an aid to trade with those countries. Opinion in the United States was split – a bill to permit metric-only labelling at the federal level was to have been introduced in 2005 but significant <b>opposition</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Food Marketing Institute, representing US grocers, has delayed the introduction of the bill. During a routine decennial review of the directive in 2008, the EU postponed the sunset clause for dual units indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Garrard was {{regarded}} as a strong chief executive who surrounded himself with knowledgeable advisors. His friend, John Edwards, and his son, William Garrard, were both in the state senate and kept him abreast of issues there. He showed {{that he was willing to}} continue with Shelby's direction for the state by re-appointing Secretary of State James Brown, but the aging Brown retired in October 1796, only a few months into Garrard's term. Garrard then appointed Harry Toulmin, who had resigned the presidency of Transylvania Seminary in April due to <b>opposition</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> institution's more conservative trustees. Although he did not retain outgoing Attorney General John Breckinridge, who had sided with Logan in the disputed gubernatorial election, Garrard still frequently consulted with him on complex legal questions.|$|E
