5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of September16, a reconnaissance plane recorded flight-level winds of 185km/h (115mph). Around this time, surface winds were estimated to be the same, making Helen a Category3 equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Later that day, the storm made landfall near Cape Kushimoto. In Shionomisaki Lighthouse, just west of where the center <b>of</b> <b>Helen</b> passed, a barometric pressure of 955mbar (hPa; 28.26inHg) was recorded, the lowest {{in relation to the}} storm. As the system neared Hokkaido, it slowed down and began a multi-day anticyclonic loop. During this period, it merged with an upper-level low and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September19. The remnants <b>of</b> <b>Helen</b> then tracked across southern Hokkaido before dissipating just east of the island on September21.|$|E

5|$|During her narrative, Penelope expresses {{opinions}} on several people, addresses historical misconceptions, and comments on life in Hades.

5|$|Fielding was {{concerned}} with the audience's reaction to his various scenes. This is internally reflected in {{the actions of the}} character Merital in Love in Several Masques in controlling the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>Helen</b> and that many of his characters believe that they are either actors or are performing on a stage. Also, this is a primary concern of Fielding's when he crafted his Scriblerian plays.|$|E

5|$|Around 10:00pm {{local time}} on 4January, {{the centre of}} Tropical Cyclone Helen made {{landfall}} near Channel Point. As it moved ashore, the storm developed an eye; however, this feature began breaking apart once overland and the eyewall merged into the system's feeder bands. Roughly 12hours after landfall, Helen weakened to a tropical low before moving over the Gulf of Carpentaria late on 5January. Due {{to an increase in}} forward motion, the system was unable to regenerate sufficient convection to be reclassified a tropical cyclone before making a second landfall along the Cape York Peninsula. Once overland again, the remnants <b>of</b> <b>Helen</b> abruptly slowed and were last noted on 7January in the same region.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, Potter revised a {{tale about}} a rabbit named Peter {{she had written}} for a child in 1893, and {{prepared}} a dummy book of it in imitation <b>of</b> <b>Helen</b> Bannerman's 1889 best-seller The Story of Little Black Sambo. Unable to find a buyer, she published the book {{for family and friends}} at her own expense in December 1901. Frederick Warne & Co. had earlier rejected the tale, but, anxious to compete in the booming small format children's book market, reconsidered and accepted it following the recommendation of their prominent children's book artist L. Leslie Brooke. Potter agreed to colour the pen and ink illustrations of the private edition, and chose the then-new Hentschel three-colour process for reproducing her watercolours. On 2 October 1902 The Tale of Peter Rabbit was released.|$|E

Despite Kassandra's warnings, the city experiences an earthquake sent by Poseidon, killing the three young sons <b>of</b> <b>Helen</b> and Paris. After Patroklus is killed by Hector, his closest friend Akhilles again joins the fight to get his revenge. Hector and his younger brother Troilus are killed, to the grief of everyone in Troy.

Olver grew up on his father's farm, where the two tended cows, while his mother ran a boarding house which served families from Philadelphia and New York City. Olver {{graduated from high school}} when he was 15 and enrolled in Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in chemistry at the age of 18.

5|$|Potter had {{maintained}} {{contact with her}} last governess Annie Carter Moore and had grown fond of her children. Through the 1890s, she sent illustrated story letters to the children. Mrs. Moore recognised the literary and artistic value of the letters and urged her former charge to publish. Potter liked the suggestion, and, in 1900, revised a tale she had written for five-year-old Noel Moore in 1893, and fashioned a dummy book of it in imitation <b>of</b> <b>Helen</b> Bannerman's 1899 bestseller The Story of Little Black Sambo. Unable to find a buyer for the tale, she published it {{for family and friends}} at her own expense in December 1901.|$|E

5|$|Starting in late December, {{widespread}} rains {{produced by}} the precursor to Helen prompted the issuance of flood warnings throughout the Top End region. Prior {{to the arrival of}} Cyclone Helen on 4January, the Bureau of Meteorology issued cyclone warnings for areas between the Mitchell Plateau, in Western Australia, to Cape Hotham in the Northern Territory. According to local officials, flooding was the greatest concern from the storm rather than wind damage. The warning area was later condensed to encompass areas from Wadeye to Cape Hotham, including Darwin and the Tiwi Islands. By 6January, warnings were issued for the western coast of the Cape York Peninsula between Karumba and Weipa as the remnants <b>of</b> <b>Helen</b> were forecast to regain storm intensity.|$|E
5|$|Wilkes wrote a History of Oregon, Geographical and Political in 1845, {{which was}} inaccurate. Notwithstanding this, an extract {{from the work}} was {{published}} as Project for a National Railroad from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, also in 1845. It was popular and was in its fourth edition by 1847. In 1848 and 1849, Wilkes wrote a novel, loosely based on the life and murder <b>of</b> <b>Helen</b> Jewett, a New York prostitute. The novel was first serialized in the National Police Gazette before being published as a stand-alone work in 1849, titled The Lives <b>of</b> <b>Helen</b> Jewett and Richard P. Robinson. The novel was only based on Jewett's life and death, with much embellishment. It combined {{the facts of the}} case with elements from contemporary novels of murder mysteries and seduction in the growing cities of the time. Wilkes did have access to some of Jewett's letters, which had been held by the district attorney's office since Jewett's murder in 1836 and the subsequent trial. Wilkes, who obtained the letters in 1848, also acquired the hatchet which had murdered Jewett. The letters were eventually published in the Police Gazette and even were displayed, along with the murder weapon, in the newspaper's office window.|$|E
