5|$|A {{draft design}} was {{completed}} without foreign assistance by the Construction Department on 11 July 1939, {{but it did}} not reflect the numerous technical developments that had entered capital ship designs after the First World War. In particular, its armor scheme was utterly obsolete, as it lacked any substantial amount of deck armor or good underwater protection; it came closer to the designs of 20 to 25years previous than to that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> warship.|$|E
5|$|Disney {{remains the}} central figure {{in the history of}} animation.

5|$|Early Classic ceramic finds {{are scarce}} at Motul de San José {{and those that}} have been found were a minor {{component}} in mixed fill deposits. This suggests that Motul de San José was largely abandoned in the Early Classic. The best examples of Early Classic pottery come from outside of Motul de San José itself, with several complete ceramic vessels being recovered during the construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> language school in Trinidad de Nosotros and some fragments of Early Classic pottery being retrieved from a looted chultun at Wakutal.|$|E

5|$|In 1791, Congress {{chartered}} the First Bank of the United States {{to handle}} the country's financial needs.

5|$|In {{common with}} the other main island chains of Scotland {{many of the more}} remote islands were {{abandoned}} during the 19th and 20th centuries, in some cases after continuous habitation since prehistoric times. These places had been perceived as relatively self-sufficient agricultural economies, but both island residents and outsiders later came to consider that the more remote islands lacked the essential services <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> industrial economy.|$|E
5|$|Jeffrey Tayor of Stagescreen Productions had {{the idea}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> version of Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in the mid-1990s. He {{attempted}} to get it produced in the United States three times, but all three attempts fell through for various reasons. He returned to England from {{the west coast of}} the United States and joined with Hartswood Films when Elaine Cameron was scouting for ideas for a supernatural thriller. Cameron then approached Steven Moffat for a script, and a six-part series was commissioned by the BBC's Jane Tranter and John Yorke in November 2005.|$|E

Narayan's simplified fingering technique allows for glide (meend) and affected the modern sarangi concert style, as aspects of his playing and tone creation were taken up by sarangi players from Narayan's recordings.|$|E

They must plan where to place facilities in the tower that include restaurants, condominiums, offices, hotel rooms, retail stores and elevators. To prevent tenants from vacating their properties, the player must keep their stress low by fulfilling their demands for medical centers, parking lots, recycling facilities, clean hotel rooms {{with the help of}} housekeepers, and an efficient transportation system, which involves managing elevator traffic. SimTower, which was built around an elevator simulation program, places a strong emphasis on good elevator management.|$|E
5|$|The French {{officers}} {{recruited by}} Pigneau {{were used to}} train Nguyễn Ánh's armed forces and introduce their technological expertise to the war effort. Olivier de Puymanel {{was responsible for the}} construction of fortifications. One of Nguyễn Ánh's first actions was to ask the French officers to design and oversee the construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> European-style citadel in Saigon. The citadel was designed by Theodore Lebrun and de Puymanel and 30,000 people were used to construct it in 1790. The townfolk and their mandarins were heavily taxed for the work, and the labourers were worked {{to the extent that it}} provoked a revolt.|$|E

5|$|The rule of Michael the Brave, {{with its}} break with Ottoman rule, tense {{relations}} with other European powers and {{the leadership of the}} three states, was considered in later periods as the precursor <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> Romania, a thesis which was argued with noted intensity by Nicolae Bălcescu. This theory became a point of reference for nationalists, as well as a catalyst for various Romanian forces to achieve a single Romanian state. To Romanian Romantic nationalists, he was regarded as one of Romania's greatest national heroes.|$|E
5|$|After the work-ins had ended, work {{continued}} on finishing the cap which {{was scheduled for}} lift-on in October. The weather hampered the work initially, but the application <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> microporous paint, designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain waterproof, was completed {{in time for the}} lift-on. A mini work-in was held the weekend before the cap was lifted, with 17 people participating over the weekend. Final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill. The tarpaulin was removed and the trammel dismantled. The 5-ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on 24 October 1983, watched by a crowd of some 70 people. The fitting of the cap was toasted with beer from Adnams Brewery, Southwold.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{is the use}} of any {{combination}} of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment, either by making animals or objects hard to see (crypsis), or by disguising them as something else (mimesis). Examples include the leopard's spotted coat, the battledress <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> soldier, and the leaf-mimic katydid's wings. A third approach, motion dazzle, confuses the observer with a conspicuous pattern, making the object visible but momentarily harder to locate. The majority of camouflage methods aim for crypsis, often through a general resemblance to the background, high contrast disruptive coloration, eliminating shadow, and countershading. In the open ocean, where there is no background, the principal methods of camouflage are transparency, silvering, and countershading, while the ability to produce light is among other things used for counter-illumination on the undersides of cephalopods such as squid. Some animals, such as chameleons and octopuses, are capable of actively changing their skin pattern and colours, whether for camouflage or for signalling.|$|E
