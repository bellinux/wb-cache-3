5|$|Declan {{begins to}} spend time with Bridget Parker and they go joyriding together. Bridget is banned from seeing him after they are pursued by the police, but she sneaks out to meet Declan. They argue and Bridget leaves. She is then hit by a car and is paralysed down <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> body. Declan becomes a suspect and he hides at Lassiter's Hotel. He is kidnapped by Nick Thompson (Marty Grimwood) and Laura Davidson (Jodi Flockhart), who want money from Paul. Laura {{eventually}} frees Declan and he is found by Rebecca, Paul and Oliver. Bridget believes Declan cannot handle her disability and she starts dating Josh Taylor (Liam Hemsworth). At an illegal dance party, Bridget, Josh and Declan become trapped when the roof falls in. Declan manages to carry Josh out before coming back for Bridget. He tells her that he does not have a problem with her disability and they start a relationship. Bridget discovers that she is pregnant and when she tells Declan, he runs away. He is arrested and kisses a football groupie, but he later returns and commits to Bridget and the baby. When Declan tries to rescue Elle Robinson's (Pippa Black) cat, he receives an electric shock. This makes him think about his life and he proposes to Bridget, who accepts. A few months later, Declan and Bridget marry in front of their friends.|$|E
25|$|The video {{opens with}} a shot of running water. Rihanna is then {{presented}} undressing and climbing into a bathtub. Throughout {{the rest of the}} video, the singer is presented nude in the tub full of cloudy green water; subtle camera angles protect her modesty. Rihanna is shown wearing little make-up and with long hair tangled and wet over <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face. The singer seems morose and sad as she occasionally flickers her eyes to the ceiling and puts her head in her hands, showing off long manicured nails and a diamond stud earring. The low-key video also features Mikky Ekko, who performs his parts of the song separately including scenes of him {{perched on the edge of}} a different bathtub, gazing into a mirror, in front of an unlit fireplace, and sitting on a grand chair. The video switches between the pair throughout the course of the video until it concludes with a single tear falling from Rihanna's eye as she sinks lower into the bathtub.|$|E
25|$|Four {{days after}} the {{discovery}} of Mixer's body, on March 25, a surveyor discovered the nude, mutilated body of a teenage girl behind a vacant house on a remote, rural section of Earhart Road, {{just a few hundred}} yards from where the body of Joan Schell had been discovered eight months previous. Investigators called to the crime scene noted a dramatic increase in the savagery exhibited against the victim, with one investigator describing the injuries inflicted upon the victim as being the worst he had seen in 30 years of police work. A subsequent autopsy revealed the victim had died of numerous fractures covering one-third of her skull and <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face, all of which had been inflicted with a heavy blunt instrument. These injuries had been inflicted after the victim had been extensively beaten and tortured: her killer had placed a section of her own shirt into her trachea to muffle her screams as she received extensive blunt force trauma to the face, head and body, including several deep lacerations believed to have been inflicted with a leather strap. Welt marks upon the chest and shoulders indicated the killer had also used restraints to hold the victim prone as he whipped her torso and upper legs with a leather belt before tearing a branch from a nearby tree and inserting this instrument eight inches into her vagina. Blood spatterings and churned soil close to the crime scene indicated she had been beaten close to where her body was discovered, and that she may have attempted to escape her attacker.|$|E

500|$|One of Bridget's first {{high-profile}} storylines was {{coping with}} a disability, after Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) hit Bridget with her car. She had been paralysed on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> body, the storyline saw her trying to regain the complete use of her body. Mignon explained during an interview with media reporting website Last Broadcast, the research that had been carried out and the effects on the character stating: [...] "Bridget suffers extreme physical difficulties as a result, because she's such a sporty tomboy, to be incapacitated suddenly poses emotional problems for her. To make sure that I could understand better what Bridget's going through, I studied medical notes on paralysis and disability on the internet." [...] The storyline also explored self-image issues that come with disabilities, in one episode Bridget was doing physiotherapy exercises and became in danger of drowning until Declan Napier (James Sorensen) saved her. He tried to kiss her but she fended off his advances, of this Mignon said: [...] "Bridget pushes him off, she fears he'll see her differently due to her disability." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hargitay's parents {{divorced}} in May 1963, but a judge later found their Mexican divorce invalid. They reconciled {{a few months}} before Hargitay's birth in January 1964, but soon separated again. In August 1964 her mother successfully petitioned the court to rule the Mexican divorce legal. A few weeks later, Mansfield married the director Matt Cimber, who had directed her in a 1964 production of the William Inge play Bus Stop. [...] On June 29, 1967, Mansfield was killed in an automobile accident on a stretch of U.S. Route 90 between New Orleans and Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. Her boyfriend, Sam Brody, and the driver were also killed. Asleep {{in the back of the}} vehicle, Hargitay, then three and a half years old, was left with a zigzag scar on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head. Her brothers Miklós and Zoltán were also in the car, but escaped with minor injuries. After the death of their mother, the three siblings were raised by their father and his third wife, Ellen Siano. [...] Hargitay dislikes comparisons with her famous mother and at age 18 said, [...] "My dad was Mr. Universe, so it would be fun for me to be Miss Universe." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harriet Lowe was {{attacked}} while {{in bed with}} Louis Besumer. As is mentioned previously, Lowe was hacked above her left ear and found unconscious {{at the scene of}} the crime before she was rushed to Charity Hospital. Lowe became the center of a media circus, as she continually made scandalous and often false statements relating to both the attacks and the character of Louis Besumer, some of which are described in the preceding description. The Times-Picayune sensationalized Lowe and her outspoken nature upon discovering that she was not the wife of Besumer, but his mistress. [...] A Charity Hospital source discovered the scandal, when Besumer asked to be directed to the room of [...] "Mrs. Harriet Lowe," [...] and was inevitably denied access as no woman by that name was a patient. [...] Besumer's legal wife arrived from Cincinnati in the days immediately following the discovery, which further inflamed the ongoing drama. [...] Lowe further gained media attention as she repeatedly made statements which voiced her dislike of the New Orleans chief of police, as well as her reluctance to comply with police questioning. [...] After the truth of her marital status was revealed publicly, Lowe told reporters from the Times-Picayune that she would no longer aid the police in their investigation, as she suspected that it had been Chief Mooney who first informed the press of the scandal. [...] Despite the scandal, and her delirious statements which suggested that Besumer was a German spy, Lowe returned to the home she shared with Besumer weeks after the attack. [...] <b>One</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face was partially paralyzed due to the severity of the attack. [...] Lowe died August 5, 1918, just two days after doctors performed surgery in an effort to repair her partially paralyzed face. [...] Just prior to her death, Lowe told authorities that she suspected it was Louis Besumer who had attacked her.|$|E

2500|$|In 1913, at age 21, Vita {{married the}} 27-year-old writer and {{politician}} Harold George Nicolson (21 November 1886 – 1 May 1968) {{in the private}} chapel at Knole. Nicknamed Hadji, or pilgrim, by his father, he was the third son of British diplomat Arthur Nicolson, 1st Baron Carnock (1849–1928). Sackville-West's parents were opposed to the marriage under the grounds that Nicloson had an annual income of £250 as he was the third secretary at the British Embassy in Constantinople {{and his father had}} been made a peer only under Queen Victoria while another of Sackville-West's suitors, Lord Granby [...] had an annual income of £100,000 pounds, owned vast acres of land and was heir to an old title, the Duchy of Rutland. The couple had an open marriage. Both Sackville-West and her husband had same-sex relationships before and during their marriage, as did {{some of the people in}} the Bloomsbury Group of writers and artists, with many of whom they had connections. Writing in the third person Sackville-West wrote in her early years of her marriage she [...] "never knew the physical passion she had felt for Rosamund, she didn't really miss it either". Sackville-West saw herself as psychologically divided into two: <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> personality was feminine, soft, submissive and attracted to men while the other side was masculine, hard, aggressive and attracted to women. Following the pattern of his father's career, Harold Nicholson was at different times a diplomat, journalist, broadcaster, Member of Parliament, and author of biographies and novels. The couple lived from 1912 to 1914 in Cihangir, a suburb of Constantinople (now Istanbul), the capital of the Ottoman Empire. Sackville-West loved Constantinople, writing a poem to celebrate the city that read: [...] "She has an early morning all her own/A blending of mist and sea and sun/Into an indistinguishable one". However, the duties of a diplomat's wife did not appeal to her and only during her time in the Ottoman Empire did she accept with good grace playing the part of a [...] "correct and adoring wife of the brilliant young diplomat" [...] as she sarcastically later wrote. After returning to England in the summer of 1914 to ensure that a pregnant Sackville-West would give birth in a British hospital, the couple bought Long Barn in Kent, where they lived from 1915 to 1930. The British declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire in November 1914 following Ottoman naval attacks on Russia precluded a return to Constantinople. They employed the architect Edwin Lutyens to make many improvements to the house. The couple had two children: Nigel (1917–2004), who became a well-known editor, politician, and writer, and Benedict (1914–1978), an art historian. At Christmas 1917, Nicolson had to tell his wife that he contracted a venereal disease following one of his anonymous sexual encounters with either a man he met at a party that spring whose name he could not remember or a servant at the Knebworth estate and he probably passed it along to her, though subsequent medical tests established he did not.|$|E

50|$|It {{was first}} thought that {{crosslinking}} {{was making the}} cotton fabric wrinkle resistant by strengthening its fibers, but the amount of crosslinking used in her treatment is small and does not add much strength. She developed a new theory on how crosslinking works. It is known that cellulose molecules can stick to each other {{by means of the}} weak hydrogen bonds between molecules. She proposed that <b>one</b> <b>side</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>her</b> crosslinking process was the strengthening of the hydrogen bonds, which made the material resistant to wrinkling.|$|R
