30|$|Although {{a number}} of studies have {{examined}} EFL teachers’ beliefs of feedback on student writing, few have investigated teachers’ feedback beliefs about student oral activities like <b>oral</b> <b>presentations.</b> To fill this research gap, this study explores three experienced EFL teachers’ beliefs about feedback on <b>oral</b> <b>presentations</b> in terms of the nature, focus, interpersonal functions, strategies and source of teacher feedback. Using semi-structured interviews and classroom observations, this study identified six major beliefs about feedback on student <b>oral</b> <b>presentations</b> and provided implications regarding how EFL teachers provide effective feedback to enhance student performance in <b>oral</b> <b>presentations.</b>|$|R
500|$|The first essay, [...] "Replies and Responses", {{concerns}} [...] "conversational dialogue" [...] and the {{way people}} respond during a conversation, both verbally and non-verbally.

Specifically, Goffman discusses [...] "self-talk" [...] (talking {{to no one in}} particular) and its role in social situations. Next, in [...] "Footing", Goffman addresses the way that footing, or alignment, can shift during a conversation. The fourth essay, [...] "The Lecture", originally an <b>oral</b> <b>presentation,</b> describes different types and methods of lecture.

500|$|Ginsburg {{volunteered to}} write the brief for Reed v. Reed, , wherein the Supreme Court {{extended}} the protections of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to women for the first time. She argued and won Frontiero v. Richardson, , which challenged a statute {{making it more difficult}} for a female service member to claim an increased housing allowance for her husband than for a male service member seeking the same allowance for his wife. Ginsburg argued the statute treated women as inferior, and the Supreme Court ruled 8–1 in her favor. The Court again ruled in Ginsburg's favor in Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, , where Ginsburg represented a widower denied survivor benefits under Social Security, which permitted widows but not widowers to collect special benefits while caring for minor children. She argued it discriminated against female workers denying them the same protection as their male counterparts. Ginsburg filed an amicus brief and sat with counsel at oral argument for the case Craig v. Boren, , in which she challenged an Oklahoma statute which set different minimum drinking ages for men and women. For the first time, the Court imposed what is known as [...] "intermediate scrutiny" [...] on laws discriminating based on gender, a heightened standard of Constitutional review. Her last case as a lawyer before the Court was 1978's Duren v. Missouri, , which challenged the validity of voluntary jury duty for women as she deemed women's participation in government service as vital and that jury duty should not be optional. At the end of Ginsburg's <b>oral</b> <b>presentation,</b> then-Associate Justice William Rehnquist asked Ginsburg, [...] "You won't settle for putting Susan B. Anthony on the new dollar, then?" [...] Ginsburg said she considered responding, [...] "We won't settle for tokens", but instead opted not to answer the question.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{research}} aims {{to investigate}} the thematic structures in students’ research papers and <b>oral</b> <b>presentations.</b> Specifically, it focuses on two aspects, i. e. types of Theme and realizations of topical Theme in students’ research papers and <b>oral</b> <b>presentations.</b> It is qualitative in nature, and involves three students’ research papers and transcribed students’ <b>oral</b> <b>presentations</b> as the main research data. Findings from the research show differences of thematic structures in students’ research papers and <b>oral</b> <b>presentations</b> {{in terms of the}} types of Theme used and realizations of topical Theme. Firstly, the types of Theme used in students’ research papers and <b>oral</b> <b>presentations</b> were interpersonal, textual, and topical.

40|$|This {{research}} {{seeks to}} describe the moves {{of the body of}} <b>oral</b> <b>presentations</b> delivered by UTM Students enrolled in English for Workplace Communication. It also aims to determine the differences between the moves found in the body of <b>oral</b> <b>presentations</b> delivered by students in Faculty of Management and Human Resources Development and those delivered by students in Faculty of Education. The techniques used for obtaining data were videotaping and transcribing the <b>oral</b> <b>presentations.</b> The instruments used were transcribed <b>oral</b> <b>presentations</b> and Seliman’s (1996) checklist of moves of <b>oral</b> <b>presentations.</b> The findings of this research revealed that the students actually shared a set of similar moves in the body of their <b>oral</b> <b>presentations.</b> Differences observed were on the aspects of the utilization of moves that are unique by a certain group and the different strategies in setting the sequence of their moves. The non-linguistic differences discovered were found in the aim of presentation, knowledge on task, adequacy of information and structure of presentation...|$|R
30|$|Another {{benefit of}} <b>oral</b> <b>presentations</b> is that {{students}} can use four English skills (i.e. listening, speaking, reading and writing) in an integrated way (Brooks and Wilson 2014; King 2002). More often the spoken components of <b>oral</b> <b>presentations</b> are recognized because {{students are required to}} speak while presenting. Meanwhile, the communicative nature of <b>oral</b> <b>presentations</b> allows non-presenting students as the audience to practice listening skills {{in such a way that}} they are able to interact with the presenters. When preparing for <b>oral</b> <b>presentations,</b> students need to conduct extensive English readings to find out supporting materials for the presenting topics; and then write out appropriate information in their PowerPoint slides. In a nutshell, the use of <b>oral</b> <b>presentations</b> helps bridge “the gap between language study and language use” (King 2002, p. 402). <b>Oral</b> <b>presentations</b> have far more advantages than simply promoting English proficiency. <b>Oral</b> <b>presentations</b> serve as effective means of teaching lifelong skills that can extend beyond the educational setting into a professional context after graduation since many future employers attached great importance to communication skills and the ability to give formal presentations (Pittinger et al. 2004).|$|R

2500|$|Chief Justice Vinson dissented; Justices Reed and Minton joined him.

Rejecting the view that Congress had limited the executive's authority to seize property in this case by providing for different procedures in the legislation it had enacted, Vinson's opinion nonetheless appeared to recognize Congress' primacy in enacting legislation, justifying the seizure in this case as necessary to preserve the status quo so that Congress could act in the future, but mocking arguments based on the Constitution's provision allowing the President to recommend legislation, rather than to make it himself, as [...] "the messenger-boy concept of the Office".|$|E
