5|$|Construction of a {{connection}} between the river and the Trent and Mersey Canal was begun in 1871 and completed in 1875. Because of the difference in level, a vertical boat lift was designed by Edwin Clark, using counterbalanced tanks which were linked by a hydraulic system. A descending tank caused hydraulic fluid to enter the pistons which raised the other tank. The design was a success, but the fluid became contaminated, resulting in corrosion of the pistons. The lift was replaced by a new design, where each tank was attached to its own counterbalance weight by wire ropes and pulleys, with small electric motors to <b>overcome</b> <b>friction.</b> The new lift was built {{over the top of the}} old one, so that it could continue to be used until the new one was ready, and the work was carried out by staff of the Navigation, supervised by the engineer J A Saner. It was completed in 1906, and continued in use until 1983, when it was closed on safety grounds due to corrosion.|$|E

500|$|A {{specialized}} type of [...] {{located on}} the distal part of inner [...] of [...] {{on the wings of}} most flighted birds. Friction barbules support lobe-shaped ("lobular") [...] that are broader than the typical barbicel hosted by other vaned feathers, and which in turn support more [...] The theory is that the augmented surface area and other adaptations significantly increases grip through friction when the outer web of barbs of one primary feather come into contact and rub against the inner web of barbs of another primary feather it overlays, thereby preventing slippage during the rigors of flight. Friction barbules are found only on those parts of primary feathers that are in [...] "zones of overlap" [...] with neighboring primaries. The theory (and the use of [...] "friction" [...] in the title of the defined phrase) has been criticized. In Avian Flight (2005), the author notes that [...] "most birds open and close their wings during every wing beat cycle", and proposes that the energetic cost to <b>overcome</b> <b>friction</b> during the [...] "wing extension and flexion" [...] of each beat cycle would be prohibitive. Offered instead is the theory that the function of these specialized barbules is to lock the primary feathers together on the wings' downstroke, during which high pressure from below the wings' surface would otherwise tend to cause the feathers to spread.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the weight}} of the {{caissons}} and counterweights would now be borne by the lift superstructure instead of by the rams, the superstructure was strengthened and put on stronger foundations. The new superstructure was built around the original lift frame {{in order to avoid the}} need to dismantle the original lift, which would have taken it out of service for a long period. The new superstructure consisted of ten steel A-frames, five on each side, supporting a machinery deck 60ft (18 m) above the river level where the electric motors, drive shafts and cast-iron headgear pulleys were mounted. Wire ropes attached to both sides of each caisson passed over the pulleys to 36 cast iron counterweights weighing [...] each, 18 on each side to balance the [...] weight of each loaded caisson. The electric motor had to <b>overcome</b> <b>friction</b> between the pulleys and their bearings. A [...] motor was installed, but normal operation only required about half of this power.|$|E
60|$|Now why is this? Simply {{because in}} laying {{one thing on}} another you only move weight.

40|$|Abstract: This work {{deals with}} {{reduction}} of surface roughness of reciprocating parts {{of an internal}} combustion engine and its frictional loss and thereby improving overall efficiency. Surface coatings {{can be used to}} reduce surface wear of components. The use of these coatings for engine applications presents a suitable solution to this problem. The materials coated can suddenly show very different properties compared to what they exhibit on a macro scale, enabling unique applications. A major part of the power produced by the engine is lost in <b>overcoming</b> <b>friction</b> between the reciprocating parts. Friction coefficient can be found by the test conducted on ‘Pin on disk apparatus’. Before coating bench mark values are taken from uncoated and we compare those valued with values obtained after coating. The technique used for coating is Wire Arc Spray process...|$|R
50|$|The {{forward path}} of loop 0 asserts that {{acceleration}} {{is proportional to}} torque and the velocity is the time integral of acceleration. The backward path says that as the speed increases there is a friction or drag that counteracts the torque. Torque on the load decreases proportionately to the load velocity until the point is reached that all the torque is used to <b>overcome</b> <b>friction</b> and the acceleration drops to zero. Loop 0 is intrinsic.|$|E

50|$|Comparative {{biomechanics}} is {{the application}} of biomechanics to non-human organisms, whether used to gain greater insights into humans (as in physical anthropology) or into the functions, ecology and adaptations of the organisms themselves. Common areas of investigation are Animal locomotion and feeding, as these have strong connections to the organism's fitness and impose high mechanical demands. Animal locomotion, has many manifestations, including running, jumping and flying. Locomotion requires energy to <b>overcome</b> <b>friction,</b> drag, inertia, and gravity, though which factor predominates varies with environment.|$|E
25|$|The preload {{achieved}} by torquing a bolt {{is caused by}} the part of the torque that is effective. Friction in the threads and under the nut or bolt head use up some fraction of the applied torque. Much of the torque applied is lost <b>overcoming</b> <b>friction</b> under the torqued bolt head or nut (50%) and in the threads (40%). The remaining 10% of the applied torque does useful work in stretching the bolt and providing the preload. Initially, as the torque is applied, it must <b>overcome</b> static <b>friction</b> under the head of the bolt or nut (depending on which end is being torqued) and also in the threads. Finally, dynamic friction prevails and the torque is distributed in a 50/40/10 % manner as the bolt is tensioned. The torque value is dependent on the friction produced in the threads and under the torqued bolt head or nut and the fastened material or washer if used. This friction can be affected by the application of a lubricant or any plating (e.g. cadmium or zinc) applied to the threads, and the fastener's standard defines whether the torque value is for dry or lubricated threading, as lubrication can reduce the torque value by 15% to 25%; lubricating a fastener designed to be torqued dry could over-tighten it, which may damage threading or stretch the fastener beyond its elastic limit, thereby reducing its clamping ability.|$|R

When this stress becomes great enough to rupture the crust, or to <b>overcome</b> the <b>friction</b> that prevents one block of crust from slipping past another, energy is released, {{some of it}} in the form of various kinds of seismic waves that cause ground-shaking, or quaking.|$|R
40|$|The {{wool and}} cotton {{spinning}} processes are quite different, regarding the opening, cleaning and blending operations. However, yarn formation with different parameters due to fiber characteristics (length and origin) {{could take place}} in the same machine. Factors involved are the drafting and twisting parameters. In this work, a preliminary study regarding the use of the ring spinning process to produce wool and cotton yarn is carried out concerning the drafting system, as {{this is one of the}} major differences between the process for the two materials. During the drafting operation, fibers must be moved relatively to each others as uniformly as possible, by <b>overcoming</b> <b>friction</b> between them. As they show different average lengths, it is necessary to provide means for automatic adjustment of the roller distance according to the type and length of fiber being processes...|$|R
50|$|This is {{the measure}} of the torque {{produced}} by a stepper motor when it is operated without an acceleration state. At low speeds the stepper motor can synchronize itself with an applied step frequency, and this pull-in torque must <b>overcome</b> <b>friction</b> and inertia. It is important {{to make sure that the}} load on the motor is frictional rather than inertial as the friction reduces any unwanted oscillations.The pull-in curve defines an area called the start/stop region. Into this region, the motor can be started/stopped instantaneously with a load applied and without loss of synchronism.|$|E
50|$|Wheel: The {{wheel is}} clearly an {{important}} early machine, such as the chariot. A wheel uses {{the law of the}} lever to reduce the force needed to <b>overcome</b> <b>friction</b> when pulling a load. To see this notice that the friction associated with pulling a load on the ground is approximately the same as the friction in a simple bearing that supports the load on the axle of a wheel. However, the wheel forms a lever that magnifies the pulling force so that it overcomes the frictional resistance in the bearing.|$|E

50|$|This {{technically}} {{very interesting}} construction managed to lift approximately 1000 tonnes of ship and water filled trough using {{a relatively small}} amount of power. The trough was supported by 5 cylindrical floats each immersed in 40 metre deep water-filled wells. The lift from the floats {{was the same as}} the load of the water filled trough therefore, only a small electric motor sufficient to <b>overcome</b> <b>friction</b> and viscous resistance was needed to set the trough in motion in either direction. Four steel worm gears, 20 metres long and 280 mm in diameter were used to direct the trough in the appropriate course.|$|E
