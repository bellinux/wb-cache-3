5|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{characteristic of the}} rare genetic condition, Lesch–Nyhan syndrome, is self-harm and may include biting and head-banging. Genetics {{may contribute to the}} risk of developing other psychological conditions, such as anxiety <b>or</b> <b>depression,</b> which could in turn lead to self-harming behaviour. However, the link between genetics and self-harm in otherwise healthy patients is largely inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|Clinicians {{assess the}} {{physical}} aspects {{such as the}} appearance of a patient, including apparent age, height, weight, and manner of dress and grooming. Colorful or bizarre clothing might suggest mania, while unkempt, dirty clothes might suggest schizophrenia <b>or</b> <b>depression.</b> If the patient appears much older than his or her chronological age this can suggest chronic poor self-care or ill-health. Clothing and accessories of a particular subculture, body modifications, or clothing not typical of the patient's gender, might give clues to personality. Observations of physical appearance might include the physical features of alcoholism or drug abuse, such as signs of malnutrition, nicotine stains, dental erosion, a rash around the mouth from inhalant abuse, or needle track marks from intravenous drug abuse. Observations can also include any odor which might suggest poor personal hygiene due to extreme self-neglect, or alcohol intoxication. Weight loss could also signify a depressive disorder, physical illness, anorexia nervosa or chronic anxiety.|$|E

5|$|Z. ferox is {{only known}} from small, {{wingless}} females. The head {{is similar to}} those of queens of Z. tonsora, but they can be separated by the lack of ocelli and rugose patches found on the vertex. Only a single row of denticles is present, and the vertexal margin (seen posterodorsally) is concave. The mesosoma is smooth and contains a single spine, fovea (a pit <b>or</b> <b>depression</b> in a structure) or carina (a keel-like elevation on the body-wall of an insect). The posterior portion of the propodeal surface is concave; it is high and strongly angled. All legs have flattened femurs (the largest region of an insect's leg) and tibiae, and the tibiae are carinated both anteriorly and posteriorly. The gaster (the bulbous posterior portion of the metasoma) has five known segments. Like the queen, Z. ferox has a large, retractable stinger, in which the external part is enclosed by the gonostyli (sting sheaths).|$|E
5|$|Cognitive and emotional: neuropsychiatric {{symptomatology}} {{is common}} {{in the course of}} the disease. Depression and anxiety appear in up to 80% of patients,. Emotional lability leading to uncontrollable crying is also common. These symptoms can be treated with antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy; however, high quality studies on efficacy are lacking. For example, in the specific case of antidepressants and depression, only two studies were considered worth considering as of 2011 by the Cochrane collaboration and they only showed a trend towards efficacy. Other neuropsychiatric symptoms are euphoria and disinhibition. Cognitive impairment is a frequent complication of MS even after the introduction of disease-modifying treatments in the last 20 years. Although the disease is usually the primary cause of cognitive problems, other factors such as medications, relapses <b>or</b> <b>depression</b> may be enhancing them so a correct evaluation of the deficits and factors exacerbating them is important. Regarding primary deficits, data point towards administration of L-amphetamine and methylphenidate being useful, whereas memantine and anticholinesterase drugs such as donepezil—commonly used in Alzheimer disease— are not considered effective in improving cognitive functions. Effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation therapy is more controverted. For those patients with MS who have pseudobulbar affect (PBA), characterized by uncontrollable episodes of crying and/or laughing, or other emotional displays, Dextromethorphan/quinidine can be considered as treatment as it is the only FDA approved drug for treatment for PBA, though other medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants have been used in clinical practice.|$|E

40|$|A {{thermally}} conductive composite material, a thermal transfer device {{made of the}} material, and a method for making the material are disclosed. Apertures <b>or</b> <b>depressions</b> are formed in aluminum or aluminum alloy. Plugs are formed of thermal pyrolytic graphite. An amount of silicon sufficient for liquid interface diffusion bonding is applied, for example by vapor deposition or use of aluminum silicon alloy foil. The plugs are inserted in the apertures <b>or</b> <b>depressions.</b> Bonding energy is applied, for example by applying pressure and heat using a hot isostatic press. The thermal pyrolytic graphite, aluminum or aluminum alloy and silicon form a eutectic alloy. As a result, the plugs are bonded into the apertures <b>or</b> <b>depressions.</b> The composite material can be machined to produce finished devices such as the thermal transfer device. Thermally conductive planes of the thermal pyrolytic graphite plugs may be aligned in parallel to present a thermal conduction path...|$|R

25|$|Drug addiction, alcoholism, {{a mental}} disability, bio-chemical changes and PTSD can all {{lead to a}} person {{committing}} an aggressive act against another person. Not having sufficient skills {{on how to handle}} oneself when faced with aggression can lead to very undesirable outcomes. These factors are typically associated with a heightened chance of anger, but there are other, less-known factors that can lead to people acting in a negative way. Prolonged or intense anger and frustration contributes to physical conditions such as headaches, digestive problems, high blood pressure and heart disease. Problems dealing with angry feelings may be linked to psychological disorders such as anxiety <b>or</b> <b>depression.</b> Angry outbursts can be a way of trying to cope with unhappiness, <b>or</b> <b>depression.</b>|$|E
25|$|Apart from {{physical}} wounds or starvation, {{a large percentage}} of refugees develop symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) <b>or</b> <b>depression.</b> These long-term mental problems can severely impede the functionality of the person in everyday situations; it makes matters even worse for displaced persons who are confronted with a new environment and challenging situations. They are also at high risk for suicide.|$|E

25|$|As {{with other}} mental disorders, psychopathy as a {{personality}} disorder {{may be present}} {{with a variety of}} other diagnosable conditions. Studies especially suggest strong comorbidity with antisocial personality disorder. Among numerous studies, positive correlations have also been reported between psychopathy and histrionic, narcissistic, borderline, paranoid, and schizoid personality disorders, panic and obsessive–compulsive disorders, but not neurotic disorders in general, schizophrenia, <b>or</b> <b>depression.</b>|$|E
25|$|Zaleplon is not {{recommended}} for chronic use in the elderly. The elderly are {{more sensitive to the}} adverse effects of zaleplon such as cognitive side effects. Zaleplon may increase the risk of injury among the elderly. It should not be used while in pregnancy or lactation, and in patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse, psychotic illness <b>or</b> <b>depression,</b> clinicians should devote more attention.|$|E
25|$|BDNF: BDNF is {{implicated in}} {{neurogenesis}} in the hippocampus, and {{studies suggest that}} depressed patients have decreased levels of BDNF and reduced hippocampal neurogenesis. It {{is not clear how}} neurogenesis restores mood, as ablation of hippocampal neurogenesis in murine models do not show anxiety related <b>or</b> <b>depression</b> related behaviours. Chronic imipramine administration results in increased histone acetylation (which is associated with transcriptional activation and decondensed chromatin) at the hippocampal BDNF promotor, and also reduced expression of hippocampal HDAC5.|$|E

25|$|In Eastern {{cultures}} shyness-inhibition in school-aged {{children is}} seen as positive and those that exhibit these traits are viewed well by peers and are accepted. They tended {{to be seen as}} competent by their teachers, to perform well in school and to show well-being. Shy individuals {{are also more likely to}} attain leadership status in school. Being shy or inhibited does not correlate with loneliness <b>or</b> <b>depression</b> as those in the West do. In Eastern cultures being shy and inhibited is a sign of politeness, respectfulness, and thoughtfulness.|$|E
25|$|Some memory {{issues are}} due to stress, anxiety, <b>or</b> <b>depression.</b> A {{traumatic}} life event, such as {{the death of a}} spouse, can lead to changes in lifestyle and can leave an elderly person feeling unsure of themselves, sad, and lonely. Dealing with such drastic life changes can therefore leave some people confused or forgetful. While in some cases these feelings may fade, it is important to take these emotional problems seriously. By emotionally supporting a struggling relative and seeking help from a doctor or counselor, the forgetfulness can be improved.|$|E
25|$|During the 18th century, opium {{was found}} to be a good remedy for nervous disorders. Due to its {{sedative}} and tranquilizing properties, it was used to quiet the minds of those with psychosis, help with people who were considered insane, and also to help treat patients with insomnia. However, despite its medicinal values in these cases, it was noted that in cases of psychosis, it could cause anger <b>or</b> <b>depression,</b> and due to the drug's euphoric effects, it could cause depressed patients to become more depressed after the effects wore off because they would get used to being high.|$|E
