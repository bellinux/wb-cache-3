Reed relays have continued in their uses outside the telephone industry such as for automatic test equipment and electronic instrumentation due to their hermetic seal, fast <b>operate</b> <b>time,</b> extended life to 109 operations and highly consistent contact performance. Reed relays have also found numerous applications in RF and microwave switching applications. They are also used in applications which make use of their extremely low leakage current (in the order of femtoamperes) such as photomultiplier detectors and other extremely low current handling circuits. Reed switches can also be manufactured to withstand several kilovolts and are still used as high-voltage relays in place of more costly sulfur hexafluoride or vacuum relays.|$|E

40|$|Background: Obesity and {{visceral fat}} {{are thought to}} be the most {{important}} factors influencing the technical difficulty during open and laparoscopic surgery. The authors aimed to investigate the effect of retroperitoneal fat mass on surgical outcomes in patients undergoing laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Patients and methods: This prospective study included 51 consecutive patients who underwent lateral transabdominal laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Body mass index (BMI) and retroperitoneal fat area (RFA) /adrenal mass area (AMA) ratio were calculated. Results: There was a positive correlation between BMI and <b>operating</b> <b>time</b> and postoperative complications and hospital stay. According to 2 -way analysis of vari-ance, only RFA/AMA ratio (P =. 0001) was found to significantly correlate with <b>operating</b> <b>time,</b> whereas BMI did not significantly correlate with <b>operating</b> <b>time</b> (P =. 51). In patients with high BMI, high RFA indicated longer <b>operating</b> <b>time</b> and higher complication rate, whereas low RFA was associated with significantly shorter <b>operating</b> <b>time</b> and decreased risk of complications.

30|$|Our mean <b>operating</b> <b>time</b> was 273  min. This {{appears to}} be long in {{comparison}} with the published data reporting <b>operating</b> <b>times</b> in the region of 90 – 110  min [13, 24 – 27]. Our technique requires an extra 10 to 20  min of <b>operating</b> <b>time</b> for the clipping procedure. However, we did not evaluate time needed for the clipping, enucleation and morcellation procedures separately. We are looking into this in a randomised controlled trial which has started in January 2007. Another explanation for the extended <b>operating</b> <b>time</b> could be the average number (7.5) and large size (67  mm/ 421  g) of the fibroids we removed solely laparoscopically. The larger the fibroids, then the more time consuming is the uterine wound repair and morcellation [28].

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the effects of LigaSure™ versus {{conventional}} bipolar techniques on <b>operating</b> <b>time</b> and blood loss during laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy in a randomized controlled trial. Methods: In three teaching hospitals, 100 women undergoing a laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy were randomized for LigaSure or conventional bipolar instruments. Primary outcome was <b>operating</b> <b>time</b> (from initial skin incision to removal of the specimen). Secondary outcome measures were total <b>operating</b> <b>time</b> (from initial skin incision to skin closure), time to dissect the ovarian and infundibulopelvic ligaments, intraoperative blood loss, and subjective judgment of the instrument used. Results: There were no differences in <b>operating</b> <b>time</b> and total <b>operating</b> <b>time</b> using LigaSure versus conventional bipolar instruments: 41. 0 vs. 39. 2 min (p = 0. 78; 95 % CI = - 10. 9 to 14. 5) and 54. 6 vs. 58. 6 min (p = 0. 46; 95 % CI = - 14. 8 to 6. 8), respectively.
