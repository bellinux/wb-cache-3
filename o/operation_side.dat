40|$|Background: Although lymphedematous skin {{exhibits}} delayed wound healing, {{little is}} known about lymph drainage during wound healing. We investigated the wound healing process in the presence of lymphatic dysfunction. Methods and Results: The right inguinal lymph nodes (iLNs) and the surrounding tissue were excised in each mouse (the <b>operation</b> <b>side),</b> and a sham operation was performed in the left hindlimb (the control side). The next day, full-thickness wounds were made on both hindlimbs. The right hindlimb exhibited acute edema until day 3; however, it started to improve after day 4, and the wound area and epithelialization ratio were similar on both sides. Indocyanine green (ICG) was injected into both hindlimbs to observe lymph flow. On the <b>operation</b> <b>side,</b> ICG leaked out of the surgical site or remained at the injection site until day 2. Some lymph flow toward the existing lymph vessels was seen on day 3, and on day 10, lymph flow toward the axial LNs was detected on the <b>operation</b> <b>side</b> in all mice. On the <b>operation</b> <b>side,</b> the number of dermal lymph vessels was significantly increased on days 3 and 15. The dermal lymph vessel area of the peripheral wound was significantly smaller on the <b>operation</b> <b>side.</b> Conclusions: In a hindlimb lymphedema mouse model, lymph transiently accumulated in subcutaneous tissue, and then was gradually absorbed by the existing lymph vessels. The {{increase in the number of}} lymph vessels contributes to lymph drainage during wound healing. Acute lymphedema because of transient lymphatic dysfunction has little effect on wound healing. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017. Embargo Period 12 month...|$|E

There is no clear evidence of determining which side should be opera ted upon first, thus we report our criteria for determining priority of <b>operation</b> <b>side</b> in patients with symptoms of bilateral hemispheric involvement. Methods : Between 1995 and 2005, twenty-three patients underwent superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) anastomosis with/without encephalo-myo-synangiosis (EMS). We classified them into three groups. Recent stroke side showed worse hemodynamic state in group A, same hemodynamic state in group B and better hemodynamic state in group C. All patients underwent surgical revascularization according to the policy of priority for recent stroke side treatment. Result : There are eighteen cases in group A, four cases in group B and one case in group C. All the patients in group A were doing well. Only one case in group B developed contralateral cerebral infarction after operation. In group C, the only one case resulted in contralateral cerebral infarction after operation.

40|$|Introduction: Carotid Endarterectomy (CE) can be {{mentioned}} as a valuable theraputic method for primary and secondary prevention of stroke, provided it can be performed in vascular surgery centers with a low surgical risk. Thus, the present study aimed to assess prognosis of CE in high risk patients of an Iranian vascular surgery center. Methods: This prospective observational study consisted of 50 high risk CE patients during 2011 - 14 in Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. All the high risk CE were performed by a vascular surgeon and a surgical carotid shunt was placed in each CE. Neurologic evaluation was performed before CE and serial neurologic axamination was done after CE by a neurologist. Surgical complications including stroke, death and lower cranial nerve palsy were recorded for 30 days after operation. Results: The study results revealed that 80 % of high risk CE patients had symptomatic carotid stenosis on the <b>operation</b> <b>side</b> and 80 % had carotid stenosis contralateral to the <b>operation</b> <b>side.</b> Thirteen high risk CE were performed simultaneously with coronary artery by pass graft and 24 patients were demonstrated to have diabetes. Post surgical death and stroke in the high risk CE patients were reported 2 % and 4 %, respectively. Lower cranial nerve palsy appeared in 2 % of patients. Conclusion: The 6 % post operative stroke and death rate in the high risk CE patients are comparable to best vascular surgery centers in Europe and North America...|$|E

The Laser-Sintering process has been executed on EOSINT M 250 Xt {{with a series of}} pre-identified optimized process control data. Standard Material, i. e. DirectMetal 20 (Ni-Cu-CuP alloy) with a layer thickness of 20 Mikrometer has been used to generate the models. A quality check to determine the dimensional errors between the CAD-models and generated models has been conducted after the Laser-Sintering process is completed. Finally, the accuracy is identified of about 50 Mikrometer in x- and y-direction. The research are about to be continued to increase the accuracy and the surface quality by using conductor materials with thinner layer thickness of about 10 Mikrometer and beyond, such as ceramics and metals with small ratios of binders and additives.

Fourty-eight knees were divided to two different post-operative rehabilitation regimes: a flexion regime and an extension regime. The two groups were well matched with respect to age, gender, <b>operation</b> <b>side</b> and pre-op diagnosis All patients were implanted with a NexGen cemented total knee prosthesis and all operations were performed by the same surgeon. Patients were assessed pre-operatively, {{at the time of}} discharge, at 6 weeks and at 12 weeks, and were evaluated by means of the Knee Society Score (KSS) and the WOMAC score, the Clarkson criteria for range of motion and muscolar strength measurement, and the Verbal Numeric Scale (VNS) for the pain. Futhermore, postoperative blood loss was assessed by comparing the volume of blood in the drain {{at the time of their}} removal and measuring the difference in preoperative and postoperative blood haemoglobin (Hb) in the 2 groups. Patients subjected to the flexion regime had a better KSS and Womac score after 12 weeks and had less post-operative blood loss, requiring fewer blood transfusions. No differences were found between the two groups in terms of pain and muscolar strength. We believe a flexion regime after a total knee arthroplasty is a valid option of rehabilitation treatment and does not result in an increase in wound problems.|$|E

MethodsOne hundred forty-one patients with TLE who underwent anterior temporal lobectomy were included in the study. The surgical outcomes of 24 patients with unilateral temporal hypometabolism on FDG-PET without an epileptogenic lesion on MRI were compared with that of patients with unilateral temporal hypometabolism on FDG-PET with MTS on MRI (n= 117). The outcomes were compared using Engel's classification at 2 years after surgery. Clinical characteristics, unilateral interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), histopathological data and <b>operation</b> <b>side</b> were considered as probable prognostic factors. ResultsClass I surgical outcomes were similar in MRI-negative patients and the patients with MTS on MRI (seizure-free rate at postoperative 2 years was 79. 2 % and 82 % in the MRI-negative and MTS groups, respectively). In univariate analysis, history of febrile convulsions, presence of unilateral IEDs and left temporal localization were found to be significantly associated with seizure free outcome. Multivariate analysis revealed that independent predictors of a good outcome were history of febrile convulsions and presence of unilateral IEDs. ConclusionOur results suggest that epilepsy surgery outcomes of MRI-negative, PET positive patients are similar to those of patients with MTS. This finding may aid in the selection of best candidates for epilepsy surgery...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose—We {{sought to}} {{investigate}} whether in patients with a symptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion, endarterectomy of a severe stenosis of the contralateral carotid artery can establish long-term cerebral hemodynamic improvement. Methods—Nineteen patients were studied on average 1 month before and 6 months after contralateral carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Volume flow in the main extracranial and intracranial arteries was measured with MR angiography. Collateral flow via the circle of Willis and the ophthalmic arteries was studied with MR angiography and transcranial Doppler sonography, respectively. Cerebral metabolism and CO 2 vasoreactivity were investigated with MR spectroscopy and transcranial Doppler sonography, respectively. Twelve nonoperated patients with a symptomatic ICA occlusion and contralateral ICA stenosis, who were matched for age and sex, served as control patients. Results—In patients who underwent surgery, flow in the operated ICA increased significantly (P, 0. 05) and flow in the basilar artery decreased significantly (P, 0. 01) after CEA. On the occlusion side, mean flow in the middle cerebral artery increased significantly from 71 to 85 mL/min (P, 0. 05) after CEA. The prevalence of collateral flow via the anterior communicating artery to the occlusion side increased significantly (47 % before and 84 % after CEA; P, 0. 05), while the prevalence of reversed ophthalmic artery flow on the <b>operation</b> <b>side</b> decreased significantly (42 % before and 5 % after CEA; P, 0. 05).

40|$|According to {{currently}} available seismicity catalogues, seismicity (for example, {{the number of}} events with M_s ≥ 8) {{around the turn of}} the century, from 1897 to 1906, was significantly higher than in recent years. However, the magnitudes of the earthquakes which occurred during this period were determined by Gutenberg, who used the records obtained by the undamped Milne seismograph with the assumption that the effective magnification is 5. Because of saturation of the Milne seismogram for very large events used by Gutenberg for calibration, the gain (= 5) used by Gutenberg could have been underestimated, and therefore the magnitude overestimated. Because of the lack of damping, the magnification of this instrument needs to be calibrated carefully. In order to calibrate the instrument response, a Milne seismograph was constructed and has been in <b>operation</b> <b>side</b> by side with damped seismographs at Pasadena. Eleven events have been recorded since February 1977. On the basis of (1) comparison of the amplitudes measured on the Milne seismograms with those of the standard seismograms, (2) numerical experiments simulating the response of the Milne seismographs to surface waves, and (3) examination of Gutenberg's original materials used for the calibration, we conclude that the average effective gain is as large as 20 for very large earthquakes, resulting in systematic reduction of the magnitude of up to 0. 6. This reduction is large enough to suggest that the turn-of-the-century seismicity peak is of marginal significance...|$|E
