25|$|The {{local area}} with its <b>open</b> <b>views,</b> rural lanes, commons and woodland, criss-crossed by {{footpaths}} and bridleways consequently are {{very popular with}} cyclists, walkers and horse-riders. The churches of Hawridge and Cholesbury jointly hold a Summer Fête on August Bank Holiday, alternatively on Hawridge and Cholesbury Commons. The Kimblewick Hunt (previously known as Vale of Aylesbury with Garth & South Berks Hunt) traditionally hold a meet on Boxing Day (26 December) which draws a large crowd from the local district. Quoits was played on the Commons up until the 1920s and the Full Moon pub had a Bowling Alley until the 1970s.|$|E

25|$|Mitigating {{damage to}} the {{environment}} was a concern, as part of creating an authentic experience of the landscape, which was to unroll like a movie from the motorist's perspective. The median strip was therefore relatively narrow; trees were retained close to the highway and sometimes, for example in the oak forest near Dessau, in the median. In fact the driver's experience of the forest, assigned symbolic importance in German Romanticism and particularly under the Nazis, was maximized by avoiding straightaways in forested areas so that the driver remained enclosed by the trees as long as possible. To some extent the autobahn landscapers were influenced in this emphasis on the natural environment by the American parkways; Todt had a 1934 USDA bulletin on Roadside Improvement reprinted for his planners' use, and Nazi designers visited Westchester County to study them, {{about the same time}} that the Westchester County Parks Commission (WCPC) was partly overseeing the construction of what is today the Taconic State Parkway's southern stretches. But the Reichsautobahn aimed for a more natural, less parklike view from the road, and although in both countries using natively occurring plants in highway landscaping was important, the Americans selectively emphasized those with an attractive appearance. Also, the autobahn was at the time presented, by Todt and others, as an improvement to the natural landscape; Todt refused to avoid the Siebengebirge, a protected conservation area, arguing not only that the area should be opened up for visits but that the road would make it more beautiful. This was not the policy in the U.S., where, most famously, the Blue Ridge Parkway was designed to be narrow and unobtrusive. Cost had the opposite effect with respect to plantings than it did with respect to curves: the Reichsautobahn landscapers had performed pioneering analyses of local ecosystems that led them to plant intensively in order to reconstruct what they determined would have been naturally present at the site, but at the end of 1936, as a result of cost overruns as well as his personal philosophy, Todt severely curtailed plantings, calling for an emphasis on <b>open</b> <b>views.</b>|$|E

30|$|Four {{conditions}} {{that had been}} used in a previous study (Nasar et al. 1983) were considered as a priori conditions: (1) an <b>open</b> <b>view</b> with an unprotected observation point; (2) a closed view with an unprotected observation point; (3) an <b>open</b> <b>view</b> with a protected observation point; and (4) a closed view with a protected observation point. Additionally, all of the sites were selected to have a view of water elements (ponds) in the garden since it is known that water elements profoundly influence the visitors’ affective appraisals and are preferred to other landscape elements (Kaplan and Kaplan 1989; Kaplan et al. 1998).|$|R
