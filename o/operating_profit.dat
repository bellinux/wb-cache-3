5|$|Once {{the canals}} were {{owned by the}} London and North Western Railway, {{restrictions}} were imposed on what they could carry, and the canals failed to make sufficient money to cover the interest on mortgages. However, they made a substantial <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> for some years. Around 1850, the average annual income was £104,638, which yielded a surplus of £45,885. Most of the income was from carrying, and by 1870, income had risen to £143,976, although this only yielded a surplus of £11,727. Total traffic was 855,462 tons in 1858, but this had dropped to 742,315 tons in 1868. The carrying business was expanded in the 1870s, but although turnover increased, operating profits fell dramatically, to just £1,568 in 1876. By 1905, total traffic was 469,950 tons, nearly all of it in boats owned by the company, and between the 1870s and {{the onset of the}} First World War the company sometimes made a small <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> and sometimes a loss. Following the end of the war, working hours were cut, wages increased, and the cost of materials increased. Losses escalated, to £153,318 on an income of £227,845 in 1920, and carriage by the company ceased in 1921, in an attempt to reduce losses. 433,230 tons of goods carried in 1929 had dropped to 151,144 tons in 1940, by which time income from tolls was £17,763, and total income was £40,985.|$|E

The city engineer estimated it would need a subsidy of NOK2 million in 2006, and the politicians, who wanted the airport to run without subsidies, demanded that Vildanden guarantee for the deficit. This was rejected by Vildanden—on the contrary, the company was in dire need for more capital, and issued a private placement for NOK4 million in December 2005. The company had since the start been losing money, and needed extra capital to get through the rough until it could make an <b>operating</b> <b>profit.</b> After the placement, 15% of the company was owned by DAT, while Coast Air sold their shares. In 2005, Vildanden had a revenue of NOK15 million.|$|E
5|$|For THSRC, {{the over}} heavy {{accounting}} of the fixed cost of fixed assets like rolling stock and infrastructure (depreciation) is a significant non-cash element of total operating costs. In its {{first two years of}} operation, THSRC applied straight-line depreciation, distributing costs evenly over a period of 26.5 years. As a result, the balance of operating revenues and costs (operating income) showed a high loss {{in the first year of}} operation, which was only reduced as revenues grew in the second year. The depreciation period set for THSRC reflected the length of the B.O.T. concession rather than the much longer lifespan of the infrastructure, and it is the factor for the operating loss. After adopting an activity depreciation method which is variable in time, THSRC posted its first <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> for 2009, the third year of operation. The company reported its first annual profit of NT$5.78 billion for 2011 after five years of operation.|$|E

40|$|This article investigates whether high-growth firms grow in {{different}} ways from other firms. Specifically, we analyze how firms grow along several dimensions (growth of sales, employment, assets, and <b>operating</b> <b>profits)</b> using Structural Vector Autoregressions. Causal relations are identified by using information contained in the (non-Gaussian) growth rate distributions. For most firms, the growth process starts with employment growth, which is then followed by sales growth, then growth of <b>operating</b> <b>profits,</b> and finally growth of assets. In contrast, high growth firms put more emphasis on growth of <b>operating</b> <b>profits</b> driving other dimensions of growth, with employment growth occurring at the end...|$|R

In an effort to compete with companies that were willing to undercut Lionel's prices without diluting its premium Lionel and Ives brands, Lionel introduced a line of inexpensive electric toy trains under the Winner Toys or Winner Toy Corp. brand name, which were sold from 1930 to 1932. The starting price for a set, which included a transformer, was $3.25. These and other efforts to improve its financial standing were unable to keep Lionel from going into receivership in May 1934.|$|E
