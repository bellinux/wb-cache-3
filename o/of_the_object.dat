5|$|Electronic {{speckle pattern}} {{interferometry}} (ESPI), {{also known as}} TV holography, uses video detection and recording to produce an image <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> upon which is superimposed a fringe pattern which represents the displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> between recordings.

5|$|However, the {{discovery}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> , an object whose appearance {{was consistent with}} a D-type asteroid in an orbit typical of a long-period comet, prompted theoretical research that suggests that the Oort cloud population consists of roughly one to two percent asteroids.|$|E

50|$|Recognition {{of visual}} objects occurs at two primary levels.

At an associative level, <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> an <b>object</b> is attached to the perceptual representation and <b>the</b> <b>object</b> is identified. If a person is unable to recognize objects because they cannot perceive correct forms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objects,</b> although their knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> is intact (i.e. they do not have anomia), they have apperceptive agnosia.

5|$|A planet's {{defining}} {{physical characteristic}} {{is that it}} is massive enough for the force of its own gravity to dominate over the electromagnetic forces binding its physical structure, leading to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium. This effectively means that all planets are spherical or spheroidal. Up to a certain mass, an object can be irregular in shape, but beyond that point, which varies depending on the chemical makeup <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>object,</b> gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until the object collapses into a sphere.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} varies {{during the}} lifespan of an individual. Researchers have more specifically described cognitive flexibility as {{the capacity to}} shift or switch one’s thinking and attention between different tasks or operations typically {{in response to a}} change in rules or demands. For example, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if they are able to successfully switch from sorting cards based on the color <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> to sorting based on the type of object on the card.|$|E
5|$|Real-time {{holography}} is {{a second}} method of creating holographic interferograms. A holograph of the unstressed object is created. This holograph is illuminated with a reference beam to generate a hologram image <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> directly superimposed over the original object itself while the object is being subjected to some stress. The object waves from this hologram image will interfere with new waves coming from the object. This technique allows real time monitoring of shape changes.|$|E
40|$|Blending or {{averaging}} of two-dimensional shapes usually {{operates on}} sets of discrete points or polygons approximating <b>the</b> <b>objects.</b> This {{relies on a}} series of evenlydistributed or properly positioned points on <b>the</b> boundary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objects.</b> Features or characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> are not well considered. This paper presents asimple but effective technique for blending 2 D shapes composed of curve segments. Features that are essential for shape blending are extracted. Correspondencebetween features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> are then established. The correspondence between points on a pair of corresponding features are finally established for theinterpolation process. This allows characteristic features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> to be retained in the blending operation which is essential in industrial design. An experimentalsystem was developed for blending 2 D contours with curved boundary. Test results showed that the proposed approach produces results suitable for industrialdesign...|$|R
40|$|Dogs can use {{a variety}} of experimenter-given cues such as pointing, head {{direction}}, and eye direction to locate food hidden under one of several containers. Some authors have proposed that this is a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domestication process. In this study we tested four captive fur seals in a two alternative object choice task in which subjects had to use one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> following experimenter-given cues to locate the food: (1) the experimenter pointed and gazed at one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objects,</b> (2) <b>the</b> experimenter pointed at only one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objects,</b> (3) <b>the</b> experimenter gazed at only one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objects,</b> (4) <b>the</b> experimenter glanced at only one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objects,</b> (5) <b>the</b> experimenter pointed and gazed at one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> but was sitting closer to one <b>object</b> than to <b>the</b> other, (6) the experimenter pointed only with the index finger at one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objects,</b> (7) <b>the</b> experimenter presented a replica <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objects.</b> <b>The</b> fur seals were able to use cues which involved a fully exposed arm or a head direction, but failed to use glance only, the index finger pointing and <b>the</b> <b>object</b> replica cues. <b>The</b> results showed that a domestication process was not necessary to develop receptive skills to cues given by an experimenter. Instead, we hypothesize that close interactions with humans prior to testing enabled fur seals to use some gestural cues without formal training. We also analyzed <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seals depending on <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> difficulty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> task. Behavioral signs of hesitation increased with task difficulty. This suggests that the fur seals were sensitive to task difficulty...|$|R

5|$|Several astronomers, {{including}} Alan Hale, {{claimed the}} object was simply an 8.5-magnitude star, SAO141894, which did not appear on Shramek's computer program because the user preferences were set incorrectly.

5|$|The arms contain tension sensors so the octopus {{knows whether}} its arms are {{stretched}} out, {{but this is}} not sufficient for the brain to determine the position of the octopus's body or arms. As a result, the octopus does not possess stereognosis; that is, it does not form a mental image of the overall shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> it is handling. It can detect local texture variations, but cannot integrate the information into a larger picture. The neurological autonomy of the arms means the octopus has great difficulty learning about the detailed effects of its motions. It has a poor proprioceptive sense, and it only knows what exact motions were made by observing the arms visually.|$|E
