5|$|Below {{the bridge}} is a small island, after which an {{artificial}} cut built to avoid the circuitous route of the River Rother Navigation heads westwards. The river now discharges over a weir {{at the site of}} the former Hardham corn mill to join the Arun a little further downstream, and the junction is followed by another small island. Hardham lock was necessary because of the drop in levels caused by the mill, and the branch through Hardham tunnel headed due south a little further up the Rother. Exploration of the tunnel was described by an article in Sussex County Magazine in 1953, when both ends were accessible, and again in 2012, when only the southern end was explored. A waterworks has been built <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> of the canal at the northern end, and the tunnel mouth is within the site. The river continues in a large loop to the east. The Arun Valley railway line crosses it to reach Pulborough railway station. There is another island, with the A29 road crossing both channels. Pulborough Brooks nature reserve is to the east of the loop, and the course then meanders westwards to Greatham Bridge. The bridge consists of eight low elliptical arches, two taller arches, a cast iron span over the navigable channel, and a solid ramp to the east. Although its construction suggests that it is medieval, most of the arches were erected in 1827.|$|E
25|$|Bed load {{moves by}} rolling, sliding, and hopping (or saltating) <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> and moves {{at a small}} {{fraction}} of the fluid flow velocity. Bed load is generally thought to constitute 5-10% of the total sediment load in a stream, making it less important in terms of mass balance. However, the bed material load (the bed load plus the portion of the suspended load which comprises material derived from the bed) is often dominated by bed load, especially in gravel-bed rivers. This bed material load is the only part of the sediment load that actively interacts with the bed. As the bed load is an important component of that, it plays a major role in controlling the morphology of the channel.|$|E
500|$|The {{portion of}} NY31 in {{downtown}} Rochester between Brown Street and South Avenue {{runs along the}} old path of the Erie Canal through the city. When the canal was diverted to bypass {{the city to the}} south in 1920, the canal bed became part of the Rochester Subway while a [...] bridge was built <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> to carry a new street named Broad Street. None of Broad Street was initially part of NY31, however; when NY31 replaced NY3 west of Rochester , it entered the city by way of NY3's old routing on Lyell Avenue and rejoined its original alignment at State Street. In the late 1930s, NY31 was realigned through downtown to follow Smith and Bausch Streets east across the Genesee River and St. Paul Street and South Avenue south to Woodbury Boulevard, which at the time connected to Monroe Avenue one block to the east at South Clinton Avenue. NY31 was altered once again [...] to leave Lyell Avenue at Broad Street and follow West and East Broad Streets through downtown to South Avenue.|$|E
5000|$|Phoenix, Arizona {{utilizes}} Chevrolet Tahoes {{as primary}} patrol vehicles, with Ford Crown Victorias and Chevrolet Impalas being phased out, {{since they are}} no longer produced. As of 3/2013, it appears they will continue to use Tahoes. Phoenix Detectives use Ford F150 and Chevrolet Silverados with flat fiberglass tonneau covers <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Syracuse and Suburban Railroad {{ran from}} Downtown Syracuse to Manlius via Fayetteville <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> of city streets, Route 5 and Route 257. The {{railroad}} occupied the streets by franchise {{from the city}} of Syracuse and Villages of Fayetteville and Manlius. Additionally, routes 5 and 257 were occupied by agreement with the toll road companies.|$|R

500|$|Some {{effects were}} {{achieved}} {{in ways that}} are not immediately obvious. In one scene, a supernatural force pushes against the parlor door and bends it inward repeatedly. Though the door appears to some viewers to have been made of latex, it was in fact made of laminated wood (with a strong crew member pushing a piece of timber hard against the door). Two physical effects were used to make the spiral staircase in the library appear frightening. In one scene, the camera appears to ascend the staircase at a rapid rate. However, the point of view is backward, looking down the staircase, as the camera used the staircase's handrail as a dolly track, being lowered slowly by means of a wire. When the sequence was run in reverse at high speed, the effect was frightening. In another scene, the staircase appears to become unstable and give way as Luke Sanderson ascends it. Later, Eleanor goes up the staircase in a trance-like state. She is rescued by Dr. Markway, even as the staircase seems ready to collapse. The collapsing staircase effect was designed by a metalworker at the Borehamwood studios. The effect was created by tying portions of the steps and railing to a cable that ran inside the staircase's central pole. When the cable was slackened, these elements moved freely. [...] When tightened, the staircase appeared solid and stable. The effect was so disturbing to the cast that Robert Wise had to ascend the staircase while it was shaking in order to prove it was safe. Other effects also relied on simple cinema tricks. Early in the film, the audience sees Abigail Crain lying in bed, aging from a young child to an old woman. A camera was fixed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> and four different actresses (each a different age) posed in the bed beneath the camera. Dissolves were used to show the aging process. In another scene, the characters come across a [...] "cold spot" [...] in the haunted mansion. To show the physical effect on the characters, the makeup department applied special makeup to the characters that appeared invisible in normal light. To show the effect of cold on the skin, filters were gradually drawn over the lights on the set, revealing the [...] "cold effect" [...] makeup.|$|E
2500|$|The same {{daughter}} who allegedly saw the ghost on the staircase also reported seeing two phantom men apparently fighting on another staircase {{on the southwest}} side earlier in the 19th century. [...] Early in the 20th century, she also reported an [...] "immensely evil" [...] presence in the southwest bedroom, moving {{around the room and}} then leaning <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> [...] In the same room, a visitor to the house once observed a floating hand, not attached to any arm, attaching itself to her four-poster bed and moving up and down it. [...] Another visitor later reported an identical experience, and also reported that the bed seemed to be shaking during the encounter. [...] The southwest side of the building was apparently a focus for paranormal activity: strange noises, objects being moved, dresses being cut with regular patterns of holes, and doors opening and shutting were all reported there.|$|E

60|$|The Bath of the Nymph <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> Given {{away with}} the Easter number of Photo Bits: Splendid {{masterpiece}} in art colours. Tea before you put milk in.

60|$|The camp-meeting {{broke up}} after the Sunday morning service {{and most of the}} worshipers, sated with their devotional experience, went home, praising the Power in song as they rode away in the wagons laden with their camp furniture, and their {{children}} strewn <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedding.</b> But for others, the fire of the revival burned through the hot, long, August Sabbath day, and a devout congregation crowded the Temple.|$|R
60|$|The orchard {{was large}} and long, {{enclosed}} in a tumbledown old fence of longers bleached to a silvery gray in the suns of many lost summers. At regular intervals along the fence were tall, gnarled fir trees, and an evening wind, sweeter than that which blew <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> of spice from Lebanon, was singing in their tops, an earth-old song with power to carry the soul back to the dawn of time.|$|R

60|$|Ginger Dick got up and, leaning <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> took old Isaac by the {{shoulders}} and shook 'im as if 'e'd been a bottle o' medicine.|$|E
60|$|Another similar place, where a huge {{panel of}} plank {{was set in}} the wall, she found {{at the very end}} of the passage, beyond the couch, and was only able to reach it by {{mounting}} <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and climbing <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedding.</b> This panel was also immovable and she decided it could not be an opening because the wall beyond it was doubtless solid. This space beyond <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> where <b>the</b> room ended, contained a huge chest of quaintly carved oak. As she saw the chest her heart gave a great bound and forgetting for the moment her desire to escape she reached down and raised the lid.|$|R
30|$|At low {{pump flow}} rate as {{impregnating}} solution passed slowly <b>over</b> <b>the</b> catalyst <b>bed,</b> its residence time in impregnation reactor was long. The deepest color in <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> was observed at the entrance zone with the color front progressing with impregnation time. Because of the strong alumina–CPA interaction, the beneath layers of support adsorbed more platinum and its concentration in the impregnating solution rapidly approached zero along <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> With time and continuous passage of impregnating solution <b>over</b> <b>the</b> catalyst <b>bed</b> and subsequent adsorption and desorption, the platinum re-distributed along <b>the</b> support <b>bed</b> until a more uniform platinum distribution was obtained. The re-distribution of Pt {{is a consequence of}} equilibrium nature of its adsorption being facilitated in the presence of competitive ions.|$|R
60|$|This {{irrelevant}} exclamation {{was caused}} by the sight through the open French window--of three ladies in the flower garden, two of whom were bending <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds.</b> <b>The</b> third, upon whose figure Austen's eyes were riveted, was seated on a stone bench set in a recess of pines, and looking off into the Yale of the Blue. With no great eagerness, but without apology to Austen, Mr. Crewe stepped out of the window and approached them; and as this was as good a way as any to his horse and buggy, Austen followed. One of the ladies straightened at their appearance, scrutinized them through the glasses she held in her hand, and Austen immediately recognized her as the irreproachable Mrs. Pomfret.|$|R
6000|$|At {{that moment}} Hetty bent <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> and, softly kissing her brother's dirty face, whispered, [...] "Yes, Bobby, that's what they teach me in Sunday-school at George Yard." ...|$|E
6000|$|The tanner again leant <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> and {{the wounded}} man said, {{with a great}} effort, [...] "Tell him Robert, Sophy's husband, is dying, and wants to speak with him." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{spite of}} a {{somewhat}} natural embarrassment, Austen could not but acknowledge to himself that Mr. Meader was right. With a womanly movement which he thought infinitely graceful, Victoria leaned <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
60|$|He yawned, {{his eyes}} closing. How sleepy he was! He looked <b>over</b> at <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> Then {{he sat down}} on the edge of it and took his shoes off. So much to do, the next day.|$|R
60|$|He {{struggled}} hard, but, {{owing to}} my habit of finishing what I undertake, without any success. In ten minutes {{it was all}} down--except that {{some of it was}} spouted about rather circumstantially <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedding,</b> and walls, and me. There was more of the draught than I had thought. As he had been two days ill, I had supposed the bottle must be nearly empty; but, of course, when you think of it, a man doesn't abrogate much ink in an ordinary attack--except editors.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of different membrane reactors for the epoxidation of ethylene was {{compared with that}} of a conventional fixed-bed reactor (FBR), under identical overall reaction conditions, using a cesium-doped silver catalyst supported on α-alumina. Two packed-bed membrane reactor configurations were used, one using oxygen as permeate with ethylene flowing <b>over</b> <b>the</b> catalyst <b>bed</b> (PBMR-O), and <b>the</b> other using ethylene as permeate with oxygen flowing <b>over</b> <b>the</b> catalyst <b>bed</b> (PBMR-E). <b>The</b> study of the FBR showed that high oxygen/ethylene ratio increases ethylene oxide selectivity. The behavior of the membrane reactor was different depending on the configuration, with the PBMR-O exhibiting smaller and the PBMR-E larger ethylene oxide selectivity, as compared to the FBR. While maintaining the overall reaction conditions fixed, ethylene oxide production in the membrane reactor could be increased further by manipulating the residence time of <b>the</b> reactants <b>over</b> <b>the</b> catalyst <b>bed,</b> and <b>the</b> maximum value was obtained for the largest possible residence time. The results demonstrate the operational flexibility and potential attractiveness of membrane reactors, since local reactant concentrations and residence times can be tuned to optimize reactor performance.
