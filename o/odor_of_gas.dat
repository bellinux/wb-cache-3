5000|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the 1902 season, the Tigers appointed the 28-year-old Mercer to be their player-manager for 1903. However, on January 12, 1903, after a barnstorming tour through the west, Mercer checked into the Occidental Hotel in San Francisco and killed himself by inhaling illuminating gas at age 28. Mercer's suicide won national attention, and there were conflicting reports about the reasons for the suicide. The Sporting News reported that Mercer had been gambling and apparently saw no way to make the deficit good. According to this version, his losses included not only his own money but the funds of other players, with estimates ranging from $3,000 to $8,000. [...] Another report rejected the idea of gambling debts and blamed the suicide on a relationship with a woman. Some reports indicated that Mercer left a suicide note warning of the evils of women and gambling. There is no known substantiation for these reports, and The New York Times reported on Mercer's death as follows: [...] "Mercer registered at the Occidental Hotel last evening. He was found asphyxiated in his room to-day. Mercer registered under the name George Murray and gave his residence as Philadelphia.

40|$|It {{had been}} {{demonstrated}} by Fujii that poisonous nature of tetrodotoxin is counteracted by {{the action of}} SP (sodium sulfite solution adjusted to pH 5. 5 with ortho phosphoric acid). According to him, the antidotal virtue of SP is based on the change of chemical configuration of the toxin due to the reduction of OH groups in the molecule and the addition of sulfite to it. If it is the case, SP might exert similar influence on the several phenomena in which polyphenol compounds take an essential part such as browning of apple or potato and astringent taste of kaki (Japanese persimon). The former is brought about {{by the action of}} phenol oxidase on the natural polyphenol substance, precursor of colored material such as chlorogenic acid or catechin, and astringency of kaki is attributed to soluble tannin in the fruit. If these polyphenol compounds are chemically modified by SP as tetrodotoxin, browning of apple shall be inhibited and astringency of kaki shall be removed. Indeed, both presumed efficiencies of SP were confirmed and invsetigated as reported in our foregoing papers. However, SP must be carefully employed, because it is not ideal but sometimes harmful as food additions. Recently, Fujii discovered that cysteine also counteracts with tetrodotoxin under certain condition during the course for survey of better antidotal substances {{on the basis of his}} opinion. According to his idea, it must interfere with browning of apple as SP. In addition, employment of cysteine is desirable, from the point of enrichment of amino acid too. Therefore, cysteine was evaluated as to anti-browning efficiency. Pieces of rinded apple were immersed into 5 × 10 ^- 3 M cysteine solution of various pHs for 30 minutes at room temperature and the color of their surface was observed at 5 and 30 minutes, 1, 2, 20, 40 and 90 hours after immersion. It was established that browning of apple was clearly retarded by cysteine, especially at pH over 6. On the other hand, although browning of apple had been more or less retarded, extinguishing peculiar pink color appeared one day after immersion into cysteine solution of weak acid, and distinctive pink one after a few days which clearly differ from brown color of non-treated apple. Similar efficiency of cysteine was also established with apple juice. A piece of rinded apple was quickly homogenized into a double volume of cysteine solution with a Waring blender and filtered by suction. Optical density of the juice prepared was estimated by our usual procedure using an electric colorimeter with blue filter at 1. 5 and 20 hours after preparation. Incidentally browning of the juice was qualitatively observed. When water or buffer of pH 6 was employed as solvent in stead of cysteine solution, the juice became soon dark brown and high optical density was determined as usual. On the other hand, lower values were estimated, as concentration of cysteine increased, and no browning was observed when 5 × 10 ^- 4 or 10 ^- 3 M cysteine solution had been employed. However, pinkish color appeared in the case of lower concentration at 1. 0 ^- 4 M or below, similar to treatment with cysteine at weak acid. Since apple became brown at once after rinderin g or homogenizing, it is difficult to make uniform examination with flesh one. Rinded apple was dehydrated by homogenizing it into cold acetone. The procedure was repeated and light white powder was obtained after drying in a desicator in vacuo. An extract of the acetone powder became brown soon, when chlorogenic acid or pyrogallol was added. However, coloration of the mixture was not observed if the boiled extract had been employed. The browning was inhibited by SP and cysteine as flesh apple and sodium sulfate had no effect. Using this model system of the extract of acetone powder and pyrogallol, inhibition of browning by SP and cysteine of various concentrations could be uniformely investigated. By comparing the efficiencies of both inhibitors, it was observed that cysteine has anti-browning virtue of similar level to that of SP. When apple had been immersed into cysteine solution for a longer period, gas with indisposed odor was formed and the solution became turbid white. Gas was bubbled through lead acetate solution and black precipitates contaminated with white one were produced. Precipitates were gathered by filtration and washed a few times with 2 N sodium hydroxide solution which dissolved the white precipitate but not the black one. The black precipitate was then dissolved in 2 N nitric acid and the solution was neutralized with sodium hydroxide. Through this solution, hydrogen sulfide gas was bubbled and black precipitate was again formed, which indicated that the precipitate is lead sulfide and gas formed contains hydrogen sulfide. Into sodium hydroxide washing of the first precipitates, sulfuric acid was added and white precipitate was produced. When hydrogen sulfide was passed, black precipitate was also formed. These showed that the washing contains at least lead derived from the first white precipitate. Thus, at any rate, indisposed <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> must be attributed to hydrogen sulfide. However, formation of hydrogen sulfide did not be observed under the same condition when apple had been omitted. Similarly, if the apple was immersed into cysteine solution and warmed at 60 ℃ for 5 or 10 minutes, formation of gas also prohibited. These observations suggested that formation of gas, hydrogen sulfide, is enzymatic reaction and the enzyme concerned may be cysteine desulfhydrase. However, apple became brownish pink in color when it had been warmed for 10 minutes, although no coloration as well as gas formation was seen in the case of 5 minutes 2 ̆ 7 heating. White precipitate formed after longer immersion was obtained by centrifugation at 8, 000 r. p. m. for 30 minutes, washed with water, alcohol and ether and dried in vacuo. Infrared spectrum of the precipitate was estimated and established to be different from chlorogenic acid, cysteine and cystine, but to be similar to precipitates formed from rinded astringent kaki by the same treatment with SP or cysteine. Since cysteine is thus useful in enrichment of amino acid as well as in prohibition of browning, effects of cystine and methionine on browning of apple were investigated. It was found that cystine has no effect and browning of apple was exceedingly accelerated by methionine. Trichromatic coefficients of colors of control brown, pink with cysteine of weak acid, accelerated dark brown with methionine and inhibited browning with SP were estimated. By consulting these data on the map of CIE system, dominant wave lengths of 577, 588, 582 and 574 were estimated. According to Fujii 2 ̆ 7 s idea, cysteine should remove astringency of kaki on the same mechanism. Rinded kaki was immersed into 2 × 10 ^- 2 M SP or 2 × 10 ^- 3 M cysteine solution for 3 days and white precipitates were obtained in both solutions. They were dehydrated by washings with water, alcohol and ether and their infrared spectra were determined. It was found that spectra were quite resemble in each other, suggesting that tannin of kaki became insoluble by treatment with SP as well as cysteine and that astringency was removed. Therefore, it may be presumed that the mechanism of cysteine is similar to that of SP. 1. 剥皮したリンゴをシステイン溶液に浸漬すると褐変をある程度防止することが出来た. その作用はとくにpH 6 以上の溶液で有効であり弱酸性では果実は桃色を呈した. 2. リンゴ果汁についても同様の効果が認められた. 果実の 2 倍量のシステイン溶液を用いて果汁を調製する場合その褐変を防止するには 5 × 10 ^- 4 M程度のものが必要であつて,それより低い濃度では弱酸性溶液を用いた場合と同様に桃色を帯びた. 3. リンゴ果実からアセトンで脱水して作つた乾燥粉末の抽出液にクロロゲン酸やピロガロールを加えると生果の場合と同様に反応液は褐色を呈した. この反応系を用いるモデル実験でシステインおよびSPの褐変防止効果を測定し,システインはSPにわずかに劣るだけであることを確めた. また抽出液をあらかじめ亜硫酸処理を行なうことにより褐変力が若干低下することを観察した. 4. リンゴのシステイン処理を長期間行なうと悪臭をもつガスを発生しまた液に白濁を生じた. このガスは硫化水素であつてその発生は加熱によつて防止されることから酵素性のものでありシステインデスルフヒドラーゼの存在が推定された. また白濁液から生成沈澱を集めその赤外線吸収スペクトルを測定し,クロロゲン酸やシステインないしシスチンとは明らかに異りむしろ渋柿の脱渋処理を行つて生じた沈澱に類似していることを観察した. 5. システインの効果は褐変防止のほかに含硫アミノ酸の強化という栄養的意義がある. そのためシスチンおよびメチオニンの影響も検討したが,前者には褐変防止能はなく,またメチオニンはかえつて褐変を強く促進することが認められた. 6. 渋柿をシステインに浸漬しSPの場合と同様に白色沈澱を生成した. この沈澱はSPの場合と類似の機構で生じたことを赤外線吸収スペクトルの比較から推定した...|$|E

We tested whether dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) could discriminate among preen oil odors from 1) conspecifics and heterospecifics; 2) male and female conspecifics; 3) conspecifics from same or different population or subspecies; and 4) males with large or small plumage ornaments. Our evidence suggests that juncos can discriminate between the <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> conspecifics and heterospecifics. In 2 -way choice tests between conspecific odors, both males and females spent more time with male preen oil. Subjects did not discriminate between <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> individuals from their own population or a different one, and no relationship was found between choice and plumage ornaments. Unexpectedly, females spent more time with the <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> males with smaller body size, regardless of population of origin. This result was especially surprising because an analysis of preen oil volatile compounds revealed that the <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> smaller males were less "male-like" than the <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> larger males.
