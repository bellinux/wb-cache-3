500|$|As she {{had begun}} to do in Caged Bird, and {{continued}} throughout her series, Angelou upheld the long tradition of African-American autobiography. At the same time she made a deliberate attempt to challenge the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. [...] Most reviewers agreed that the book was made up of a series of vignettes. [...] By the time Song was written in 2002, sixteen years after her previous autobiography, Angelou had experienced great fame and recognition as an author and poet. [...] She recited her poem <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pulse</b> <b>of</b> Morning at the inauguration of President Bill Clinton in 1993, becoming the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since Robert Frost at John F.

America's most visible black woman autobiographer". [...] She had also become, as reviewer Richard Long stated, [...] "a major autobiographical voice of the time".|$|E

40|$|Trans Ionospheric Pulse Pairs are VHF signals {{consisting}} of exactly two broadband pulses, each with duration of few microseconds. The time separation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pulses</b> is typically tens <b>of</b> microseconds. Each <b>pulse</b> exhibits a frequency dispersion {{indicative of a}} sub-ionospheric origin. These emissions were distinguished from other naturally occurring radio emissions and were suspected {{to be associated with}} thunderstorms; because they were recorded onboard satellite when lightning activity was within the satellite’s VHF horizon. In the present paper we try to explain <b>the</b> two <b>pulses</b> <b>of</b> TIPPs by considering the propagation of electromagnetic waves generated during lightning discharge in two different modes. The lightning discharge is represented by the combination of two Dirac delta functions. First one for the ground to cloud discharge current and the other one is cloud to ionosphere discharge. The Maxwell’s equations are solved to derive the expression for wave-electric field as a function of frequency and distance. The exact time-dependence of the propagating non-monochromatic signal for the realistic ionospheric (IRI) model is numerically computed alongwith the IGRF model for the variation of gyrofrequency with altitude. It is observed that the separation between two signal <b>pulses</b> depends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pulse</b> separation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> excitation source; however, the intensity of the signal depends directly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pulse</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> source current...|$|R

2500|$|During the First World War, {{into which}} Canada was drawn {{due to its}} {{association}} with the United Kingdom, the governor general's role turned from one of cultural patron and state ceremony to one of military inspector and morale booster. Starting in 1914, Governor General Prince Arthur donned his Field Marshal's uniform and put his efforts into raising contingents, inspecting army camps, and seeing troops off before their voyage to Europe. These actions, however, led to conflict with the Prince's prime minister at the time, Robert Borden; though the latter placed blame on the Military Secretary Edward Stanton, he also opined that the Duke [...] "laboured under the handicap of his position {{as a member of}} the Royal Family and never realized his limitations as Governor General." [...] Prince Arthur's successor, the Duke of Devonshire, faced the Conscription Crisis of 1917 and held discussions with his Canadian prime minister, as well as His Majesty's Loyal Opposition members, on the matter. Once the government implemented conscription, Devonshire, after consulting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>of</b> the nation with Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Vincent Massey, Henri Bourassa, Archbishop of Montreal Paul Bruchési, Duncan Campbell Scott, Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and Stephen Leacock, made efforts to conciliate Quebec, though he had little real success.|$|E
2500|$|Reaction to {{the album}} in the U.S. was more {{enthusiastic}} {{than it had}} been for Byrdmaniax but still wasn't wholly positive. [...] Andy Mellen, reviewing the album in the Winnipeg Free Press in February 1972, noted [...] " [...] not being anywhere the equal of Younger Than Yesterday or even Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde, it is an encouraging LP, offering some assurance that Roger McGuinn and friends still have their fingers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>of</b> what's happening musically in 1972." [...] Ben Gerson commented on both the band and the album in the March 1972 issue of Rolling Stone magazine: [...] "There is a programmatic certainty to their music at this point which at first glance happily signifies that a first-generation band has successfully remade itself, but, after repeated exposure disappoints one with its inflexibility." [...] Gerson concluded his review of Farther Along by commenting [...] "This is not an outstanding album, either by Byrds or contemporary standards, though, for at least a Byrds fan, it contains several seductive tunes and some exemplary musicianship. But beneath the old Byrds sound, and this new, quartered approach, there is a more fundamental commitment, and that is to survival." [...] The question of The Byrds' continued existence was also echoed in a contemporary review by Bud Scoppa in the March 1972 edition of Rock magazine, in which he opined [...] "The Byrds recognized their failure on Byrdmaniax, but placed the blame on the lavish production job rather than their own disunity. [...] So what we have with Farther Along, evidently rushed out to rectify the problems caused by the last LP, is more disunity, but this time in a basic unadorned state." ...|$|E
