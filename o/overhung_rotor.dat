40|$|Severe {{flexural}} vibration of {{the rotor}} shaft of a Francis turbine runner was {{experienced in the}} past. It was shown that the vibration {{was caused by the}} fluid forces and moments on the backshroud of the runner associated with the leakage flow through the back chamber. The aim of the present paper is to study the self-excited rotor vibration caused by the fluid force moments on the backshroud of a Francis turbine runner. The rotor vibration includes two fundamental motions, one is a whirling motion which only has a linear displacement and the other is a precession motion which only has an angular displacement. Accordingly, two types of fluid force moment are exerted on the rotor, the moment due to whirl and the moment due to precession. The main focus of the present paper is to clarify the contribution of each moment to the self-excited vibration of an <b>overhung</b> <b>rotor.</b> The runner was modeled by a disk and the whirl and the precession moments on the backshroud of the runner caused by the leakage flow were evaluated from the results of model tests conducted before. A lumped parameter model of a cantilevered rotor was used for the vibration analysis. By examining the frequency, the damping rate, the amplitude ratio of lateral and angular displacements for the cases with longer and shorter <b>overhung</b> <b>rotor,</b> {{it was found that the}} precession moment is more important for smaller overhung rotors and the whirl moment is more important for larger overhung rotors, although both types of moment due to the leakage flow can cause self-excited vibration of an <b>overhung</b> <b>rotor...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} dynamic response of an <b>overhung</b> <b>rotor</b> with a propagating transverse crack. The effects of a propagating transverse crack and side load on the dynamic response of an <b>overhung</b> <b>rotor</b> are investigated {{in order to identify}} vibration signatures of a propagating crack in rotating shafts. Startup and steady state vibration signatures were analyzed and presented in the form of Bode plots, Frequency Spectrum Cascades, Frequency Spectrum Waterfalls and orbits. The startup results showed that crack reduces the critical speed and increases the vibration amplitude of the rotor system. It also excites 2 X vibration in the startup vibration signatures. The steady state results showed that the propagating crack produces changes in vibration amplitudes of 1 X and 2 X vibration harmonics and excites 3 X harmonic just before fracture. During crack propagation, 1 X amplitude may increase or decrease depending on the location of the crack and the direction of vibration measurement while 2 X amplitude always increases. The steady state vibration signal of a propagating crack also produces a two-loop orbit...|$|E

40|$|LecturePg. 121 - 136 Rotor thermal bending is a {{complicated}} phenomenon {{that can lead to}} unstable spiral vibrations. This phenomenon is primarily due to a temperature difference developing across the journal. The temperature difference can either be caused by the journal rubbing against stationary components or by viscous shearing within the lubricant. The latter mechanism {{is often referred to as}} the Morton effect. In this paper, a theoretical model has been developed for a synchronous thermal instability that is caused by differential viscous shearing in bearings of <b>overhung</b> <b>rotors.</b> This model employs an unbalance threshold criterion for instability prediction instead of using a traditional frequency-domain stability analysis. The computer program, which is based on the theoretical model, has been further developed to examine various cases that pertain to this thermal instability.

40|$|LecturePg. 39 - 48 The {{appearance}} of a strong subsynchronous instability in an overhung compressor highlights the fact that rotordynamic instabilities are not restricted to high-pressure multistage between bearing compressors with <b>overhung</b> <b>rotors.</b> Another {{important point is that}} many users mistakenly believe that tilting pad bearings eliminate all cross-coupling forces that cause subsynchronous instability. While this is true of the cross-coupling coefficients of the bearings themselves, a substantial cross-coupling coefficients of the bearings themselves, a substantial cross, coupling force from labyrinth seals can overcome the beneficial characteristics of tilting pad bearings. This paper describes the installation of an integrally geared compressor that initially had problems with high bearing pad temperatures. The manufacturer attempted to modify the bearings to reduce the pad temperatures but this was unsuccessful due to unacceptable high vibration amplitudes caused by rotordynamic instability. The rotordynamic instability was caused by a strong subsynchronous excitation of a cantilevered rotor natural frequency located at 47 percent of running speed. The subsynchronous excitation was due to labyrinth seal cross coupling effects. Based on the recommendation of the authors, the manufacturer installed swirl brakes to decrease the subsynchronous vibration excitation, which eliminated the rotordynamic instability and allowed the bearings to be modified in order to reduce bearing pad temperatures...|$|R
30|$|The TC is {{a typical}} double <b>overhung</b> <b>rotor</b> with a steel turbine and an {{attached}} aluminum compressor impeller.

All rotor components should be taken into account in the rotordynamic computation to investigate the rotor vibration response, such as the stability analysis and the frequency components in the waterfall plot. The compressor and turbine impellers are generally regarded as rigid disk to model. Due to its complex structure, the mass of rotating components, moment of inertia, and the center of gravity position can be obtained by using CAE 3 -dimensional software to model and calculate, and then add to the rotor-shaft regarded as a rigid disk.|$|E
40|$|Gravity {{critical}} {{speeds of}} rotors have hitherto been studied using linear analysis, and ascribed to rotor stiffness asymmetry. Here, we study an idealized asymmetric nonlinear <b>overhung</b> <b>rotor</b> model of Crandall and Brosens, spinning {{close to its}} gravity critical speed. Nonlinearities arise from finite displacements, and the rotor's staticlateral deflection under gravity is taken as small. Assuming small asymmetry and damping, slow modulations of whirl amplitudes are studied using the method of multiple scales. Inertia asymmetry appears only at second order. More interestingly, even without stiffness asymmetry, the gravity-induced resonance survives through geometric nonlinearities. The gravity resonant forcing does not influence the resonant mode at leading order, unlike the typical resonant oscillations. Nevertheless,the usual phenomena of resonances, namely saddle-node bifurcations, jump phenomena and hysteresis, are all observed. An unanticipated periodic solution branch is found. In the three-dimensional space oftwo modal coefficients and a detuning parameter, the full set of periodic solutions {{is found to be}} an imperfect version of three mutually intersecting curves: a straight line,a parabola and an ellipse...|$|E
40|$|A fibre refiner is a {{rotating}} machine that cut wood chips into fibres, {{which are used}} for example to produce panel boards. The aim of this thesis has been to implement a rotor dynamical model of a fibre refiner into SKF own computer program BEAST in order to study the dynamical behaviour {{of the system and}} what effect it will have on the bearings. This thesis starts with an introduction to linear rotor dynamics by a study of four degrees of freedom <b>overhung</b> <b>rotor</b> model with gyroscopic effect. This model has been solved in two different ways namely by a direct method and by FFT analyse. The FFT analysis is one way to threat rotordynamical problems when doing experiments on real machines. The analytical tool has in this case been the Campbell diagram which is a method for plotting eigenfrequencies {{as a function of the}} spin speed. In rotordynamics the sign of eigenfrequencies has dependence because of the connection to the spin speed via the gyroscopic matrix. A routine has therefore been developed for creation of Campbell diagram constructed from signals by FFT analysis in Matlab (see Appendix B for code description). Then this thesis continues with introduction to BEAUTY and BEAST. Three models of the fibre refiner have been studied during this thesis. Model A is an <b>overhung</b> <b>rotor</b> that has been compared to the analytical model, the aim of studding this model was to see if BEAST could handle the gyroscopic term in the equation of motion. In BEAST implemented with the analytical stiffness matrix directly onto the disk. Model B is modelled with rigid body rested on two flexible supports in x and y direction. This result is then compared to an analytical model B. Model C is the final concept of the refinery. Here are bearings and pressure chambers introduced in the model and possibility to ad clearance in the model. The creation of model C take one month, therefore analysis as lifetime calculations on the bearings hasn’t been done. This been the future work on this model. The results from model B shows that BEAST could handle the gyroscopic term in the equation of motion. The result from model C shows that the largest force was on bearing C closest to the rotor and that the shape of the bearing forces change when clearance where added in the simulations.

40|$|Unlike most instabilities, {{which are}} {{non-synchronous}} in nature, the Morton Effect is a synchronous phenomenon. This thermal instability occurs primarily in <b>overhung</b> <b>rotors</b> that {{are supported by}} fluid film bearings and is caused by differential viscous shearing within the bearing lubricant. The Morton Effect has also gained much attention within the last decade. Prior studies of the Morton Effect have used complex analysis in the frequency domain to model this instability. However, such an approach {{makes it difficult to}} develop a user-friendly design tool for engineers. The current research employs a steady-state analysis to predict the onset of the Morton Effect, and it uses an instability criterion which is based on a threshold unbalance caused by a force equal to 15 % of the weight of the rotor. It is hoped that this method will provide a more easily adaptable platform for design and analytical purposes. The current model has demonstrated good agreement with other theoretical models and experimental data. This agreement applies to rotors that are supported by either plain or tilting pad journal bearings and it was found that a worse case scenario for the Morton Effect would involve centered, circular and large-amplitude bearing orbits. A test rotor was also designed and built. Initial experimental data revealed an unusual instability that might have been caused by the Morton Effect. iii Dedicated to My Parents: Pooran and Savitri Balbahadur i...|$|R
40|$|Vibration induced {{hot spots}} in radial fluid film {{bearings}} can cause spiral vibrations. The phenomenon {{is known as}} Morton effect. Various authors have described the phenomenon of spiral vibrations caused by rubbing in general [1 - 4] and specifically by the differential viscous shearing in fluid film bearings [5 - 8]. The history of {{the case of a}} turbo-expander for the cryogenic industry is described. The investigated machine has a single relatively stiff <b>rotor</b> with two <b>overhung</b> impellers. The <b>rotor</b> is supported on two tilting pad bearings, as they are commonly used for these applications. It was designed in line with API 617 7 th edition [11]. During internal factory testing excessive vibration at high speed suddenly developed, in spite of very high damping and comfortable separation margins of the relevant rotor vibration modes. The vibrations evolution in a polar plot had the appearance of a spiral, as they are typically observed in case of vibration induced hot spots. The tilting pad bearings were suspected as the most likely cause for the hot spots. In parallel to the tests, hot spot stability analyses with a rotor dynamic model of the turbo-expander were carried out. The applied method, introduced by Schmied [5] allows the handling of general rotor systems. The hot spot model is based on the theory of Kellenberger [3] using a thermal equation between the shaft’s thermal deflection and the shaft displacement at the hot spot location. The analytical results gave evidence of the instabilities and confirmed the fluid-film bearings as the source of the hot spot. The model was used to assess changes for the solution of the problem. The following measures were studied: Reduction of the oil viscosity, stiffening of the rotor and reduction of the bearing width. The final successfully implemented solution was a combination of lower bearing width and reduced viscosity. Apart from this thoroughly studied case, an overview of further turbo-expanders regarding their hot spot behavior is given...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigated}} the variation of dynamical response {{of a low}} pressure rotor in turbo-shaft engine with its system parameters. Based {{on the model of}} low pressure rotor, a dynamical simplified model of two-disk rotor with Squeeze Film Damper at each end was built. Its motion equations were derived. The numerical method was applied to solve the 12 -dimensions differential equations. The influence of some parameters, e. g., rotating speed, eccentricity and its phase angle, mass ratio of two disks, were analyzed. From simulation results, {{it can be seen that}} when phase difference of two disks ’ eccentricity is π, the two disks have their minimum vibration amplitude respectively. When their phase is identical, their vibration responses reach maximum values. The larger the mass of mid-span disk is, the larger the vibrations of two disks are. When mass of mid-span is lesser than that of <b>overhung</b> <b>rotor,</b> the response of system will decrease. Squeeze Film Damper(SFD) can reduce vibration in rotor system effectively and has been used in many practical aero-engine. Many researcher works have been conducted on its influence on rotor.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 54) Modern {{high performance}} machinery almost always operates {{at a speed}} in excess {{of at least one}} critical speed. In many cases, the vibrations of important components are difficult or impossible to damp at a critical, yet the machinery must be brought up to the operating point with safety and reliability. Studies have been made during the last 50 years mathematically quantifying the fact that rapid acceleration in rotational speed through a critical does not allow time for destructive vibrations to build up beyond a permissible limit. Previous investigators have largely confined their mathematical investigations to the Jeffcott Rotor, that is, the simple straddle mounted rotor mass between two simple supports. This investigation extends the above results to the case of the <b>overhung</b> <b>rotor,</b> such as is commonly encountered in turbines. As a departure from the Jeffcott Rotor, whose natural frequency is obtained in dynamics of machinery, three kinds of methods were used to deal with the general critical speed and deflection problem, with the effects of gyroscopic, empirical formulas, a deduced quadratic equation, and analytical solutions all being employed. The second is recommended, emphatically. It is shown that considerable Gyroscopic stiffening is possible in the case of forward synchronous precession, and that the consequent elevation of the apparent critical speed and suppression of amplitude buildup can be related to proportions and unbalance by the results of a computer solution of several simultaneous non-linear differential equations. These results are presented in non-dimensional form, in simple curves to guide design...|$|E
40|$|An {{increase}} in the power-to-weight ratio demand on rotordynamic systems causes increased susceptibility to transverse fatigue cracking of the shaft. The ability to detect cracks {{at an early stage}} of progression is imperative for minimizing off-line repair time and cost. The vibration monitoring system initially proposed in Part I is employed herein, using the 2 X harmonic response component of the rotor tilt as a signature indicating a transverse shaft crack. In addition, the analytic work presented in Part I is expanded to include a new notch crack model to better approximate experimental results. To effec-tively capture the 2 X response, the crack model must include the local nature of the crack, the depth of the crack, and the stiffness asymmetry inducing the gravity-forced 2 X harmonic response. The transfer matrix technique is well suited to incorporate these crack attributes due to its modular nature. Two transfer matrix models are proposed to predict the 2 X harmonic response. The first model applies local crack flexibility coeffi-cients determined using the strain energy release rate, while the second incorporates the crack as a rectangular notch to emulate a manufactured crack used in the experiments. Analytic results are compared to experimental measurement of the rotor tilt gleaned from an <b>overhung</b> <b>rotor</b> test rig originally designed to monitor seal face dynamics. The test rig is discussed, and experimental angular response orbits and 2 X harmonic amplitudes of the rotor tilt are provided for shafts containing manufactured cracks of depths between 0 % and 40 %. Feasibility of simultaneous multiple-fault detection of transverse shaft cracks and seal face contact is discussed. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4007275]...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{involves}} {{the study of}} four problems {{in the area of}} nonlinear vibrations, using the asymptotic method of multiple scales(MMS). Accordingly, it consists of four sequentially arranged parts. In {{the first part of this}} thesis we study some nonlinear dynamics related to the amplitude control of a lightly damped, resonantly forced, harmonic oscillator. The slow flow equations governing the evolution of amplitude and phase of the controlled system are derived using the MMS. Upon choice of a suitable control law, the dynamics is represented by three coupled,nonlinear ordinary differential equations involving a scalar free parameter. Preliminary study of this system using the bifurcation analysis package MATCONT reveals the presence of Hopf bifurcations, pitchfork bifurcations, and limit cycles which seem to approach a homoclinic orbit. However, close approach to homoclinic orbit is not attained using MATCONT due to an inherent limitation of time domain-based continuation algorithms. To continue the limit cycles closer to the homoclinic point, a new algorithm is proposed. The proposed algorithm works in phase space with an ordered set of points on the limit cycle, along with spline interpolation. The algorithm incorporates variable stretching of arclength based on local curvature, through the use of an auxiliary index-based variable. Several numerical examples are presented showing favorable comparisons with MATCONT near saddle homoclinic points. The algorithm is also formulated with infinitesimal parameter increments resulting in ordinary differential equations, which gives some advantages like the ability to handle fold points of periodic solution branches upon suitable re-parametrization. Extensions to higher dimensions are outlined as well. With the new algorithm, we revisit the amplitude control system and continue the limit cycles much closer to the homoclinic point. We also provide some independent semi-analytical estimates of the homoclinic point, and mention an a typical property of the homoclinic orbit. In the second part of this thesis we analytically study the classical van der Pol oscillator, but with an added fractional damping term. We use the MMS near the Hopf bifurcation point. Systems with (1) fractional terms, such as the one studied here, have hitherto been largely treated numerically after suitable approximations of the fractional order operator in the frequency domain. Analytical progress has been restricted to systems with small fractional terms. Here, the fractional term is approximated by a recently pro-posed Galerkin-based discretization scheme resulting in a set of ODEs. These ODEs are then treated by the MMS, at parameter values close to the Hopf bifurcation. The resulting slow flow provides good approximations to the full numerical solutions. The system is also studied under weak resonant forcing. Quasiperiodicity, weak phase locking, and entrainment are observed. An interesting observation in this work is that although the Galerkin approximation nominally leaves several long time scales in the dynamics, useful MMS approximations of the fractional damping term are nevertheless obtained for relatively large deviations from the nominal bifurcation point. In the third part of this thesis, we study a well known tool vibration model in the large delay regime using the MMS. Systems with small delayed terms have been studied extensively as perturbations of harmonic oscillators. Systems with (1) delayed terms, but near Hopf points, have also been studied by the method of multiple scales. However, studies on systems with large delays are few in number. By “large” we mean here that the delay is much larger than the time scale of typical cutting tool oscillations. The MMS up to second order, recently developed for such large-delay systems, is applied. The second order analysis is shown to be more accurate than first order. Numerical integration of the MMS slow flow is much faster than for the original equation, yet shows excellent accuracy. A key point is that although certain parameters are treated as small(or, reciprocally, large), the analysis is not restricted to infinitesimal distances from the Hopf bifurcation. In the present analysis, infinite dimensional dynamics is retained in the slow flow, while the more usual center manifold reduction gives a planar phase space. Lower-dimensional dynamical features, such as Hopf bifurcations and families of periodic solutions, are also captured by the MMS. The strong sensitivity of the slow modulation dynamics to small changes in parameter values, peculiar to such systems with large delays, is seen clearly. In the last part of this thesis, we study the weakly nonlinear whirl of an asymmetric, <b>overhung</b> <b>rotor</b> near its gravity critical speed using a well known two-degree of freedom model. Gravity critical speeds of rotors have hitherto been studied using linear analysis, and ascribed to rotor stiffness asymmetry. Here we present a weakly nonlinear study of this phenomenon. Nonlinearities arise from ﬁnite displacements, and the rotor’s static lateral deflection under gravity is taken as small. Assuming small asymmetry and damping, slow flow equations for modulations of whirl amplitudes are developed using the MMS. Inertia asymmetry appears only at second order. More interestingly, even without stiffness asymmetry, the gravity-induced resonance survives through geometric nonlinearities. The gravity resonant forcing does not influence the resonant mode at leading order, unlike typical resonant oscillations. Nevertheless, the usual phenomena of resonances, namely saddle-node bifurcations, jump phenomena and hysteresis, are all observed. An unanticipated periodic solution branch is found. In the three dimensional space of two modal coefficients and a detuning parameter, the full set of periodic solutions is found to be an imperfect version of three mutually intersecting curves: a straight line, a parabola, and an ellipse. To summarize, the first and fourth problems, while involving routine MMS involve new applications with rich dynamics. The second problem demonstrated a semi-analytical approach via the MMS to study a fractional order system. Finally, the third problem studied a known application in a hitherto less-explored parameter regime through an atypical MMS procedure. In this way, a variety of problems that showcase the utility of the MMS have been studied in this thesis...|$|E
