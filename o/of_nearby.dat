5|$|The {{measurement}} of stellar parallax <b>of</b> <b>nearby</b> stars provides a fundamental baseline in the cosmic distance ladder {{that is used}} to measure the scale of the Universe. Parallax measurements <b>of</b> <b>nearby</b> stars provide an absolute baseline for the properties of more distant stars, as their properties can be compared. Measurements of the radial velocity and proper motion of stars allows astronomers to plot the movement of these systems through the Milky Way galaxy. Astrometric results are the basis used to calculate the distribution of speculated dark matter in the galaxy.|$|E
5|$|A {{cellular}} automaton {{is defined by}} its cells (often a one- or two-dimensional array), a finite set of values or states that can go into each cell, a neighborhood associating each cell with a finite set <b>of</b> <b>nearby</b> cells, and an update rule according to which the values of all cells are updated, simultaneously, {{as a function of}} the values of their neighboring cells.|$|E

5|$|According to {{measurements}} {{from the}} Hipparcos astrometric satellite, HD 28185 has a parallax of 23.62 milliarcseconds, which {{corresponds to a}} distance of 42 parsecs (138 light-years). Since the star is located further than 25 parsecs from Earth, it is not listed in the Gliese Catalogue <b>of</b> <b>Nearby</b> Stars. With an apparent magnitude of 7.81, the star is not visible with the naked eye, though {{it can be seen}} using binoculars.|$|E
5|$|As the Armero tragedy was {{exacerbated}} {{by the lack of}} early warnings, unwise land use, and the unpreparedness <b>of</b> <b>nearby</b> communities, the government of Colombia created a special program, the Oficina Nacional para la Atención de Desastres (National Office for Disaster Preparedness), now known as the Dirección de Prevención y Atención de Desastres (Directorate for Disaster Prevention and Preparedness)to prevent such incidents in the future.|$|E
5|$|Australia became {{directly}} involved when the Confederate navy visited {{in order to}} repair one of their warships. This led to protests from the Union representative at Melbourne, while the citizenry <b>of</b> <b>nearby</b> Williamstown entertained the Confederates and some Australians joined the crew. Accounts disagree as to whether Australians generally favored the Union or the Confederacy, as sorrowful demonstrations were held in Sydney when news arrived of Abraham Lincoln's assassination.|$|E

5|$|Birds {{sometimes}} also form {{associations with}} non-avian species. Plunge-diving seabirds associate with dolphins and tuna, which push shoaling fish towards the surface. Hornbills have a mutualistic relationship with dwarf mongooses, {{in which they}} forage together and warn each other <b>of</b> <b>nearby</b> birds of prey and other predators.|$|E
5|$|Convolve the {{locations}} of the points with a Gaussian function with small standard deviation, in effect replacing each point's location with a weighted average of {{the locations}} <b>of</b> <b>nearby</b> points along the curve, with Gaussian weights. The standard deviation of the Gaussian should be chosen to be small enough that, after this step, the sample points still have nearly-uniform spacing.|$|E
5|$|Flooding is a {{frequent}} occurrence in Kuala Lumpur whenever there is a heavy downpour, especially in the city centre and downstream areas. Smoke from forest fires <b>of</b> <b>nearby</b> Sumatra sometimes casts a haze over the region.

5|$|Harry confronts monsters in {{each area}} with both melee weapons and firearms. An {{ordinary}} man, Harry cannot sustain many blows from enemies, and gasps for breath after sprinting. His inexperience in handling firearms means that his aim, and therefore the player's targeting of enemies, is often unsteady. A portable radio collected {{early in the game}} alerts Harry to the presence <b>of</b> <b>nearby</b> creatures with bursts of static.|$|E
5|$|He drilled {{with the}} company, before classes, in the {{graveyard}} <b>of</b> <b>nearby</b> St. Paul's Chapel. Hamilton studied military history and tactics {{on his own}} and was soon recommended for promotion. Under fire from HMS Asia, he led a successful raid for British cannons in the Battery, the capture of which resulted in the Hearts of Oak becoming an artillery company thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, various {{observations}} from Earth {{were made of}} the limb of Triton using the occultation <b>of</b> <b>nearby</b> stars, which indicated {{the presence of an}} atmosphere and an exotic surface. Observations in late 1997 suggests that Triton is heating up and the atmosphere has become significantly denser than when Voyager 2 flew past in 1989.|$|E

His Quaternary History of the Mono Valley (1889), which included a topographic survey by Willard D. Johnson, was the first thorough scientific description of Mono Lake and its volcanic features.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{related to}} active galactic nuclei (as well as starburst regions) are low-ionization nuclear {{emission}}-line regions (LINERs). The emission from LINER-type galaxies {{is dominated by}} weakly ionized elements. The excitation sources for the weakly ionized lines include post-AGB stars, AGN, and shocks. Approximately one-third <b>of</b> <b>nearby</b> galaxies are classified as containing LINER nuclei.|$|E
