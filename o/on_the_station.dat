5|$|After delays due to {{concerns}} over nearby wetlands {{and the appearance}} of the ramps from street level, the Town of Winchester granted approval in March 2011. In April 2011, the MBTA began soliciting bids for the primary construction work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>station,</b> worth $1.525 million. The scope of work included construction of the mini-high platforms and ramps from street level, as well as adding lighting, rehabilitating the low level platforms, and creating accessible parking spaces. After bids came in higher than expected, a $2.503 million contract was awarded in July 2011 with notice to proceed in August.|$|E
5|$|By 2005, the disused eastern {{trackbed}} {{was filled}} with rubble, brambles and weeds, and the station had acquired a bad reputation due to muggings {{and the use of}} illegal drugs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>station</b> premises. A community garden project, Eastside Roots, was set up in the disused trackbed by local permaculture enthusiast Nick Ward. It was built using sustainable materials, including bricks dug out during the construction of the Cabot Circus shopping centre. The project led to a general improvement of the station ambience, and residents were more willing to use it. The footbridge was replaced in 2013 to allow for electrification of the line, but the new, higher, bridge angered local residents who felt it infringed on their privacy.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War Waterloo {{station and}} the nearby Thames bridges were a {{significant}} target for Axis bombing, and there were several near-misses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>station</b> during the London Blitz of 1940–41. Although there were several interruptions to the Necropolis train service owing to enemy action elsewhere on the line, the Necropolis station was undamaged {{during the early stages}} of the bombing campaign. During the night of 16–17 April 1941, in one of the last major air raids on London, bombs repeatedly fell on the Waterloo area. The rolling stock berthed in the Necropolis siding was burned, and the railway arch connecting the main line to the Necropolis terminus was damaged, but the terminal building itself remained unscathed.|$|E
