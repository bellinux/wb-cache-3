5|$|After the Watts Riots of 1965, Assemblyman Ryan {{took a job}} as a {{substitute}} school teacher to investigate and document conditions in the area. In 1970, he investigated the conditions of California prisons by being held, under a pseudonym, as an inmate in Folsom Prison, while presiding as chairman of the Assembly committee that oversaw prison reform. During his time in Congress, Ryan traveled to Newfoundland to investigate the practice of seal hunting. He was also famous for vocal criticism of the lack <b>of</b> <b>Congressional</b> oversight of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and authored the Hughes–Ryan Amendment, passed in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Congress is not {{prevented}} from legislating as to tribes generally; and {{this appears to}} be what it has done in successive versions of the Nonintercourse Act. There is nothing in the Act to suggest that ‘tribe’ is to be read to exclude a bona fide tribe not otherwise federally recognized. Nor, as the district court found, is there evidence <b>of</b> <b>congressional</b> intent or legislative history squaring with appellants' interpretation. Rather we find an inclusive reading consonant with the policy and purpose of the Act.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, Cleveland had campaigned {{against the}} Lodge Bill, {{which would have}} {{strengthened}} voting rights protections through the appointing of federal supervisors <b>of</b> <b>congressional</b> elections upon a petition from the citizens of any district. The Enforcement Act of 1871 had provided for a detailed federal overseeing of the electoral process, from registration to the certification of returns. Cleveland succeeded in ushering in the 1894 repeal of this law (ch. 25, 28 Stat. 36). The pendulum thus swung from stronger attempts to protect voting rights to the repealing of voting rights protections; this in turn led to unsuccessful attempts to have the federal courts protect voting rights in Giles v. Harris, 189 U.S. 475 (1903), and Giles v. Teasley, 193 U.S. 146 (1904).|$|E

5|$|Several {{months after}} the {{recommendation}} to have thiomersal removed from vaccines was published, a speculative article was published in Medical Hypotheses, a non-peer-reviewed journal, by parents who launched the parental advocacy group SafeMinds to promote the theory that thiomersal caused autism. The controversy began to gain legitimacy {{in the eyes of}} the public and gained widening support within certain elements in the autism advocacy community as well as in the political arena, with U.S. Representative Dan Burton openly supporting this movement and holding a number <b>of</b> <b>Congressional</b> hearings on the subject.|$|E
5|$|Voorhis had the {{advantage}} of incumbency, but this was balanced by other factors favoring Nixon. Due to the press <b>of</b> <b>Congressional</b> business, Voorhis was able to devote only two months to the campaign, while Nixon campaigned in the district for ten months. Voorhis's time was further limited when, while en route to California from Washington D.C. in August, he was forced to have surgery for hemorrhoids in Ogden, Utah. He spent two weeks in an Ogden hotel recuperating from the operation.|$|E
5|$|When the United States annexed Hawaii and {{established}} the Territory of Hawaii, Iaukea {{became involved in}} local politics {{as a member of}} the Democratic Party of Hawaii.

In the 1906 election, he was elected as the second sheriff of the County of Honolulu, succeeding Arthur M. Brown. He served in this position from 1907 to 1909. He was a trustee of the Queen's Medical Center from 1905 to 1909.|$|E
