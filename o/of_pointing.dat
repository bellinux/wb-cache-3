This includes: Acoustic and behavioral mimicry, Comprehension of novel sequences in an artificial language, Memory, Monitoring of self behavior, Discrimination and matching, Comprehension of symbols for various body parts, Comprehension <b>of</b> <b>pointing</b> gestures and gaze (as made by dolphins or humans), Mirror self-recognition, and Numerical values.|$|E
5|$|Fermi {{was fond}} <b>of</b> <b>pointing</b> out that Alessandro Volta, {{working in his}} laboratory, could have {{had no idea where}} the study of {{electricity}} would lead. Fermi is generally remembered for his work on nuclear power and nuclear weapons, especially the creation of the first nuclear reactor, and the development of the first atomic and hydrogen bombs. His scientific work has stood the test of time. This includes his theory of beta decay, his work with non-linear systems, his discovery of the effects of slow neutrons, his study of pion-nucleon collisions, and his Fermi–Dirac statistics. His speculation that a pion was not a fundamental particle pointed the way towards the study of quarks and leptons.|$|E

5|$|Malick's {{unconventional}} filming techniques included shooting {{part of a}} scene {{during a}} bright, sunny morning only to finish it weeks later at sunset. He made a habit <b>of</b> <b>pointing</b> the camera away during an action sequence and focus on a parrot, a tree branch or other fauna. Malick's reputation and working methods commanded great respect among the actors, with both Woody Harrelson and John Savage staying on for an extra month after they finished all of their scenes just to watch him at work.|$|E
5|$|At {{one year}} of age, joint {{attention}} is displayed through a child's understanding <b>of</b> <b>pointing</b> as an intentional act. One-year-olds also establish joint attention for objects within their visual field before objects beyond their current visual field. At this age, infants are not yet able to represent their entire environment, only what they can see. At age 15 months, children recognize the minds of others. At this age, children also {{recognize the importance of}} eyes for seeing and that physical objects can block sight. At age 18 months, infants are capable of following an individual's gaze to outside their visual field and establishing (representative) joint attention. 18-month-olds also grasp the intentional, referential nature of looking, the mentalistic experience of seeing and the role of eyes and are skilled at following both gaze and pointing with precision. At two years of age, children display joint attention by extending attention beyond the present and understanding that the targets of other's attention extends to the past as well. Two-year-olds are also capable of representational thought or increased memory.|$|E

25|$|Many {{research}} {{studies have been}} conducted concerning the effect of schemata on individuals' perceptions of others. It has been found that preschoolers are aware of gender schemata and are capable <b>of</b> <b>pointing</b> out behaviours which are inconsistent with them. In a Canadian study, participants were asked to rate various diverse groups based on how well a given characteristic applied to them. The results confirmed that participants were quicker to assign a rating if the given characteristics fit the schema for that group.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the school}} {{concerned}} with ideological differences, another theory seeks clarification in externalization of the Spanish case; instead <b>of</b> <b>pointing</b> to unique Spanish character of Carlism, it highlights general European patterns of change. With ultramontanism gaining upper hand over more conciliatory political incarnations of Catholicism after the First Vatican Council, {{and with the}} new approach made popular in the neighboring France by Louis Veuillot, the 1888 schism {{was nothing but a}} local Spanish manifestation of the trend. Defining the nascent Integrism as religious particularism striving for hegemony, this theory enjoys rather limited popularity.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the task <b>of</b> <b>pointing</b> ships into the channel, the lighthouse also signaled ships {{about the state of}} the tide. During the day this was performed using two day signals installed on two corners of the structure, while during the night two 6th order dioptric lights showing different colors coded the state of the tide. The different colours were changed manually, by lowering glass cylinders over the lanterns, which could be done from inside the structure. Records of the tide were also kept automatically by floats in tubes which graphed the tide level. The graphs were replaced every month and were sent to Greenwich where they were kept.|$|E

25|$|Also, {{an obvious}} riposte {{is that we}} can {{aggregate}} capital simply by using the first set of prices and ignoring the second, as with many inflation corrections. This does not work, however, because the variation of the rate of profit is theorized as happening at a specific point in time in purely mathematical terms rather than as part of an historical process. The point is that if neoclassical conceptions do not work at a specific time (statics), they cannot handle the more complicated issues of dynamics. This critique of the neoclassical conception is more of a matter <b>of</b> <b>pointing</b> out its major technical flaws in the theory than of presenting an alternative.|$|E
25|$|The {{pointing}} gesture is a human-specific signal, is referential in its nature, and is {{a foundation}} building-block of human communication. Human infants acquire it weeks before the first spoken word. In 2009, a study compared the responses to a range <b>of</b> <b>pointing</b> gestures by dogs and human infants. The study showed little difference {{in the performance of}} 2-year-old children and dogs, while 3-year-old children's performance was higher. The results also showed that all subjects were able to generalize from their previous experience to respond to relatively novel pointing gestures. These findings suggest that dogs demonstrating a similar level of performance as 2-year-old children can be explained as a joint outcome of their evolutionary history as well as their socialization in a human environment.|$|E
25|$|A bloodthirsty {{and arrogant}} version of Vision {{was a member}} of the Exiles' {{counterpart}} Weapon X. This Vision was very single minded in completing their murderous missions. He had a habit <b>of</b> <b>pointing</b> out to his teammates that he would survive many attacks that could kill them. He was able to single-handedly hold off the entire Exiles himself before being incapacitated and damaged by advanced Nimrod Sentinels on a parallel Earth dominated by the mutant hunting robots. Despite the damage inflicted by the Sentinels he continued to serve on several more Weapon X missions. Ultimately Vision was blasted into pieces by King Hyperion when he refused to join Hyperion in his plan to conquer one of the many parallel earths. Although briefly left alive in pieces Vision was finally killed when a huge asteroid, launched by that world's Magneto, struck the Earth and destroyed both the planet and Vision.|$|E

On May 9, Andrews' case was continued without finding for one year, during which time Andrews was ordered to pay a fine, speak to student athletes {{about the dangers of}} narcotics, and complete an NFL substance abuse program. On June 30, Andrews was arrested again and charged with assault with a dangerous weapon and unlawful possession of a firearm in Mansfield, Massachusetts, after his fiancée accused him <b>of</b> <b>pointing</b> a gun at her head. Andrews' fiancée called police, who searched Andrews' vehicle but did not find a gun; she later took her child to a hotel for the night, where Andrews then met her again before being arrested. The weapon, a Glock pistol, was later recovered in a dumpster near Andrews' apartment. Andrews was released on July 1.|$|E
