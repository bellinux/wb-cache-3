5|$|The next {{match was}} Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch against Paul London and Brian Kendrick for the World Tag Team Championship. Cade and Murdoch had the {{advantage}} over London and Kendrick early on. At one point, Murdoch pulled Kendrick outside the ring, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> rope, and threw him into Cade, who performed a sitout spinebuster onto Kendrick. London tried to help his partner until Cade superplexed him <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> rope. Murdoch took the advantage and pinned Kendrick for the win. As a result, Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch retained the World Tag Team Championship.|$|E
5|$|The pre-show {{featured}} one match, the New Japan Rumble. Tiger Mask and Yuji Nagata {{began the}} match, with new wrestlers entering each minute. Wrestlers worked to eliminate each other, {{and the last}} remaining wrestler won. In this match, eliminations could occur via pinfall, submission, disqualification, or being {{thrown out of the}} ring <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> rope. The Great Kabuki, Yoshiaki Fujiwara, and Hiro Saito were surprise entrants. Captain New Japan was the first eliminated when Tama Tonga threw him <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> rope. Sho Tanaka and Yohei Komatsu worked together to eliminate Taichi and Tiger Mask. After Tanaka was eliminated by submitting to Manabu Nakanishi's torture rack, Tonga eliminated Nakanishi and Komatsu via pinfall, the latter after a jumping DDT. Yoshi-Hashi threw Tonga <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> rope for the elimination, leaving himself and Nagata in the match. Nagata won the match by slamming Hashi against the mat with a belly-to-back suplex, bridging into a pinfall elimination at 26 minutes and 9 seconds.|$|E
5|$|A train may {{occasionally}} {{experience a}} rollback following a launch. A rollback {{occurs when the}} train fails to make it <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the tower and descends back down the side it was launched. Kingda Ka includes retractable magnetic brakes on its launch track to prevent a train from rolling back into the loading station.|$|E

5|$|England won the toss {{and elected}} to kick off. Within ninety seconds, Stanley Mortensen sent a cross {{from the left}} wing to Roy Bentley, who let off a shot that was barely pushed aside by U.S. goalkeeper Frank Borghi. By the 12th minute, England had six clear shots on goal but could not convert, with two shots hitting the post, one just going <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top,</b> and another brilliantly saved by Borghi.|$|E
5|$|Less {{than two}} months later at WrestleMania XXX on April 6, Cesaro had a big moment at WrestleMania; in a scene {{reminiscent}} of Hulk Hogan's momentous body slam of André the Giant, with only Cesaro (who had also wrestled on the pre-show) and Big Show remaining in the battle royal held as a memorial to André, Cesaro body-slammed Big Show <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> rope to win the match.|$|E
5|$|On May 31, 1917, {{the flag}} {{was chosen as}} the state's {{official}} banner. The General Assembly made only one change to Hadley's original design: they added the word Indiana, in a crescent shape, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the torch. The state banner was later renamed the state's flag in a new statute passed in 1955 that also standardized the dimensions of the flag.|$|E

5|$|TNA {{then held}} an impromptu Ten-Man Gauntlet match to {{determine}} Kevin Nash's replacement {{in the main}} event. This was the ninth match of the show {{with a duration of}} 14 minutes and 12 seconds. The participants for the match were Abyss, A.J. Styles, Jeff Hardy, Kip James, Lance Hoyt, Monty Brown, Rhino, Ron Killings, Sabu, and Samoa Joe. The rules for a Gauntlet match are as follows: two wrestlers start the match with another entering at 2 minute intervals. The objective of the match is to eliminate opponents by throwing them <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> rope and down to the floor. The last wrestler left in the ring is the winner of the contest. The last two wrestlers were Abyss and Rhino. Rhino won the match after lifting Abyss <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> rope and down to the floor.|$|E
5|$|The Plenty Brook now {{passes through}} the town's {{drainage}} system, allowing buildings to be built <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top.</b> The brook has been prone to flooding during heavy rain, especially in inland areas, which regularly causes problems for {{people living in the}} Eddington area in southern Herne Bay.|$|E

5|$|The race {{saw some}} {{incidents}} which caused riders to lose valuable time. Gu Sun-Geun (South Korea) {{lost control of}} her bike, bringing others down with her. She eventually fell into a concrete ditch {{on the side of}} the highway. Natalia Boyarskaya (Russia), who had built a lead of 59seconds <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of Badaling, had to stop to see which way to choose at a poorly marked intersection.|$|E
5|$|With these {{modifications}} {{complete and}} apparently working, the first completely free flight occurred on 12 November 1959. This test proved the nozzle control system unacceptable. The spoilers {{were intended to}} direct the air out <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> or bottom of the annular flap, out the bottom only during hover, but <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> and bottom during forward flight. The idea was that when the flap was positioned {{in order to provide}} control, the lift would be lowered on one side and raised on the other. Lift was indeed lowered on one side, but sadly the lift did not improve on the other, so every control input resulted in a loss of altitude. After five flights, testing was temporarily halted on 5 December 1959, by which time the Avrocar had logged 18.5 hours of test time in total.|$|E
5|$|A mutant {{criminal}} {{recruited by}} the Brotherhood in a prison truck, Juggernaut is incredibly strong, fast and, once he gains momentum, he is nearly unstoppable. The film's version of Juggernaut is depicted as a mutant and his relation to Charles Xavier was never mentioned. Matthew Vaughn cast Jones, who he met producing the Guy Ritchie gangster movies where Jones begun his acting career. The actor {{had to go through}} a four-hour make-up process to portray Juggernaut, which included a muscle suit and a prostethic chin. The costume tried to retain the bullet-shaped helmet of the comics without going excessively <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top.</b>|$|E

5|$|Another {{political}} pirate was the Miners pirate {{radio station}} dubbed Radio Arthur by the media, which operated in the Nottinghamshire area during the 1984/1985 miners strike; downloads {{of some of}} its programmes are available on www.g0mrf.com. This station transmitted <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of Radio Trent on both mediumwave using 3500 watts and VHF using 800 watts or more. Mentioned in a House of Lords debate in Hansard as Radio Scargill, it was stated that it had been actively pursued and closed down by the authorities; however this was incorrect and the people involved were never caught. Other recordings of Radio Arthur are on the Pirate Archive website.|$|E
5|$|At 15:30 on 21 August the Battle for Hill 60 began. Charging {{straight}} at the hill, the regiment suffered sixty per cent casualties, among them Hutton in command. He was replaced by Major Hurst, from the 1st Squadron, and they succeeded in capturing the Turkish trench within fifteen minutes of going <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top.</b> But {{on either side of}} them the rest of the attack had failed, leaving the regiment and the Otago Mounted Rifles isolated {{from the rest of the}} force. Not having the manpower to continue the assault, they were ordered to dig in and hold the position. They held on until 23 August when they were relieved by the Auckland and Wellington Mounted Rifles.|$|E
5|$|Cumulus {{supplementary}} features are most commonly {{seen with the}} species congestus. Cumulus virga clouds are cumulus clouds producing virga (precipitation that evaporates while aloft), and cumulus praecipitatio produce precipitation that reaches the Earth's surface. Cumulus pannus comprise shredded clouds that normally appear beneath the parent cumulus cloud during precipitation. Cumulus arcus clouds have a gust front, and cumulus tuba clouds have funnel clouds or tornadoes. Cumulus pileus clouds refer to cumulus clouds that have grown so rapidly as to force the formation of pileus <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the cloud. Cumulus velum clouds have an ice crystal veil over the growing top of the cloud.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War Uxbridge {{adopted the}} Royal Navy {{destroyer}} HMS Intrepid in 1942, to help towards the ship's costs; Intrepid {{was lost to}} enemy action the following year. The town and surrounding areas suffered bombing by the Luftwaffe. V1 flying bombs fell on the town between June 1944 and March 1945. The first recorded bombing using a V1 was on 22 June 1944 at 07:00, when the bomb passed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of a bus and hit four houses nearby. Seven {{people were killed and}} 25 injured, leaving 46 houses in the area uninhabitable.|$|E
5|$|In 1675, John Ogilby {{noted that}} the main {{coaching}} route from London to Southampton ran <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the down, going directly from Alresford to Twyford, avoiding Winchester. This remained the main coaching route until about 1800, when an alternative route via Winchester (now mostly the A31 and former A33) was formed. During this time, {{and up to the}} 19th century, the area was sometimes known as Morestead Down after the nearby village of Morestead.|$|E
5|$|In the 85thminute, Scholes clipped {{the ball}} <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the Barcelona {{defensive}} line to Rooney, who chested {{the ball down}} for Tevez, only to be given offside. Scholes then found Rooney again on the left wing with a raking ball from deep inside his own half, but Rooney's first touch was heavy, allowing Puyol to get back and put the ball out for a corner. Rooney took the corner short to Tevez, whose cross was just {{beyond the reach of}} Berbatov and diverted behind again by Puyol. Rooney also took the second corner, which was met by Berbatov, but he put the ball high over the crossbar.|$|E
