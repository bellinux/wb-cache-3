5|$|In Reformed theology, baptism is {{the sacrament}} of {{initiation}} into the visible church, or body of people who publicly claim faith in Christ. Baptism also signifies regeneration and remission of sin. Reformed Christians believe that the children of those who express faith in Christ should be baptized. Because baptism {{is believed to be}} beneficial <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> have faith in Christ, infants are baptized {{on the basis of the}} promise of faith which will come to fruition later in life.|$|E
5|$|Coffin did {{not enjoy}} being {{in the public eye}} and {{considered}} his job soliciting financial aid as begging for money, which he thought to be demeaning. He stated in his autobiography that he gladly gave up the position once a new leader for the organization was selected. Coffin became concerned about giving money freely to all blacks, some of whom he was believed {{would never be able to}} care for themselves unless adequate education and farms were provided. He also believed the Society should give their limited resources <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> were best able to benefit from them. The Society continued to operate until 1870, the same year that black men were guaranteed the right to vote under the Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.|$|E

25|$|In June, King Hamad {{established}} the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry composed of international independent figures {{to assess the}} incidents. The report was released on 23 November and confirmed the Bahraini government's use of systematic torture {{and other forms of}} physical and psychological abuse on detainees, as well as other human rights violations. It also rejected the government's claims that the protests were instigated by Iran. The report was criticised for not disclosing the names of individual abusers and extending accountability <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> actively carried out human rights violations.|$|E
25|$|The King also {{established}} the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI), chaired by noted human rights lawyer M.

25|$|Other {{individuals}} {{have questioned the}} assumptions that link systems of organ gifting with the equitable distribution of human organs arguing that the voluntary and altruistic donation of organs does not necessarily imply the free transplantation of that organ.

25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{preparations}} containing only dextropropoxyphene were discontinued in 2004. In 2007, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency {{removed the}} licence for co-proxamol, also called distalgesic. From then {{on in the}} UK, co-proxamol is only available on a named patient basis, for long-term chronic pain and <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> have already been prescribed this medicine. Its withdrawal from the UK market {{is a result of}} concerns relating to its toxicity in overdose (even small overdoses can be fatal), and dangerous reaction with alcohol. Recreational use in the UK is uncommon. Many patients have been prescribed alternative combinations of drugs as a replacement.|$|E
25|$|Supporters {{say that}} capital {{punishment}} is applied infrequently and <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> have committed {{the most extreme}} of crimes—a single act of murder does not attract capital punishment without additional aggravating circumstances such as rape or robbery. In the 1956 debate, Japanese serial killer Genzo Kurita, who engaged in rape and necrophilia, was cited by the Diet {{as an example of}} a murderer whose crimes were atrocious enough to merit death. However, it is more the rarity of extreme crimes in Japanese society rather than an unwillingness of the authorities to carry out executions that has caused so few executions to take place.|$|E
25|$|In 1885, Congress {{restored}} {{the authority of}} the Supreme Court to hear appeals from habeas petitions in the circuit courts. In Ex parte Royall (1886), the first case heard under the new statute, the court affirmed a habeas denial, holding that the lower federal courts had discretion to grant or deny habeas relief while the petitioner had not exhausted potential state court remedies. In Mali v. Keeper of the Common Jail of Hudson County (1887), the Court denied another such appeal, holding that the consular treaty with Belgium had not deprived New Jersey of its power to punish a murder committed on a docked foreign vessel. But, in Baldwin v. Franks (1887), the Court granted the writ on appeal, holding that the Reconstruction-era civil rights crime statute applied <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> deprived U.S. citizens (and not foreign nationals) of their rights.|$|E

25|$|At present Northern Ireland {{still faces}} {{policing}} issues, though {{not to the}} extent of the Troubles. There are concerns about harassment by police of children aged 14–18 in low socio-economic areas of Northern Ireland which has led to a deep level of mistrust between the youth and the police. Further, Catholics in Northern Ireland find that they are treated differently by police due to the police force being largely Protestant. 48% of Catholics that were surveyed in Northern Ireland reported harassment by the police. Instances of harassment include police officials spitting on individuals or enforcing laws in a discriminatory fashion, for example <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> are Catholic. The Northern Ireland Police force has moved away from police brutality given the focus on accountability for the past and the significant decrease {{in the use of the}} baton amongst police members (guns are rarely used) however harassment continues to be a key issue for Northern Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Sugihara had {{cooperated with}} Polish {{intelligence}} {{as part of}} a bigger Japanese–Polish cooperative plan. As the Soviet Union occupied sovereign Lithuania in 1940, many Jewish refugees from Poland (Polish Jews) as well as Lithuanian Jews tried to acquire exit visas. Without the visas, it was dangerous to travel, yet it was impossible to find countries willing to issue them. Hundreds of refugees came to the Japanese consulate in Kaunas, trying to get a visa to Japan. At the time, on the brink of the war, Lithuanian Jews made up one third of Lithuania's urban population and half of the residents of every town as well. The Dutch consul Jan Zwartendijk had provided some of them with an official third destination to Curaçao, a Caribbean island and Dutch colony that required no entry visa, or Surinam (which, upon independence in 1975, became Suriname). At the time, the Japanese government required that visas be issued <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> had gone through appropriate immigration procedures and had enough funds. Most of the refugees did not fulfill these criteria. Sugihara dutifully contacted the Japanese Foreign Ministry three times for instructions. Each time, the Ministry responded that anybody granted a visa should have a visa to a third destination to exit Japan, with no exceptions.|$|E
25|$|Wonga {{was founded}} by Errol Damelin (chief {{executive}} officer) in October 2006 and he linked up with software engineer Jonty Hurwitz in January 2007. Both Damelin and Hurwitz had previous internet start-up experience; neither had any experience of retail banking. When the company first started looking for funding, potential investors saw the short-term, small-loans business as an unprofitable, risky backwater. After being denied funding by UK banks, Wonga secured venture capital through Balderton Capital. The first place of business was in a shared office space in St. John's Wood, London. After a year of software development a beta website was launched in 2007. In interviews, Damelin {{has said that the}} goal was to disrupt the short-term credit industry by providing transparency, exact control of amount and payment date, immediate access to funds, and no faxing or emailing documents. The business model of lending <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> could pay back reliably, as opposed to the much wider catchment practice of payday loans required an algorithm that could fully determine risk in an automated manner – something they had difficulty developing in the early stages. To get funds directly to customer's bank accounts as quickly as possible, co-operation from leading banks was required. Banks were reportedly dismissive of Wonga's plan saying they would not be totally satisfied with customer identity without physical documentation.|$|E
