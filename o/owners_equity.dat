40|$|Provisioning {{means the}} {{evaluation}} of future costs and losses, the estimation of future liabilities towards one’s surroundings, an increase in equity, {{as well as the}} real value of assets. During asset valuation, the reserve balance may cause a reduction of the company’s value - net assets. This could be a change of a few percentage points. Non-balance provisions cause a decrease in the value of assets, from which liabilities and reserves will be deducted. The value of the enterprise – through asset evaluation – will be lower by a few percentage points. However, it is supplementary capital (capital protection) which has the greatest importance in the methods a company uses in the valuation of assets. As research indicates, retained earnings and additional capital make up 30 – 59 % of <b>owners</b> <b>equity.</b> When using the multiplier method, reserves have a small indirect effect on the amount of dividends, net income decrease, etc. – due to the reducing of the financial result and taxes. The mixed method takes up an important position in the valuation of a company’s goodwill. Therefore, the relevance of provisions in this valuation, will be lower than the during the valuation of assets. When valuating income reserves do not play a significant role. They are taken into consideration during the adjustment of the financial result, directing it towards cash flow, and for determining the financial outflows in the form of income tax. Provisions may also have a slight influence on the cost of the capital of the enterprise, i. e. a factor discounting cash flow. Provisions are not cash outflows and therefore, in the most popular income methods, they do not play a significant role. Reserves that are tax-deductible costs may affect the amount of tax burdens and thus indirectly affect the cash flow. The biggest and most direct effect of provisions on the valuation of a company can be observed in the asset methods {{as well as in the}} mixed methods. However, in the reserve multiplier methods affect the value of the multiplier element of a listed company and the value of the company measured the base element. Jolanta Żukowsk...|$|E

The recent resurgence of interest in ethanol production has prompted the Texas State Legislature to investigate the feasibility of ethanol production in Texas. The reasons for the increased interest in ethanol production could possibly relate to depressed commodity prices, gasoline price volatility, environmental regulations and a renewed push towards increased fuel sufficiently given national and world events following September 11, 2001. Past feasibility studies have failed to incorporate the risk of input and output prices in their analyses. Furthermore, it is evident from the literature, that unrealistic values were used in many of the studies, to perhaps, entice prospective investors in providing capital for the construction and operation of the ethanol facilities. This study provides an unbiased, stochastic simulation feasibility study incorporating the risks of ethanol, corn, dry distillers grains (DDGS), soybean meal, electricity, and natural gas prices on three size facilities in Texas. In addition, four different scenarios were included incorporating four levels of the proposed Texas State Producer Grant into the feasibility study. Those levels were the $ 0. 00, $ 0. 10, $ 0. 20, and $ 0. 30 /gal on the first 30 million gallons per year (MMGPY) of production for each registered plant. Rather than assuming point values for input variables and providing a deterministic analysis, the advantage {{of this study is that}} it provides a feasibility study that includes risks of input and output prices in its results. For each of the three size facilities analyzed (15, 30, and 80 MMGPY) the results of probability of negative cash flows and simple statistics, probability of dividend payments and simple statistics, present value of ending <b>owners</b> <b>equity</b> in 2022, net present value, certainty equivalents and absolute certainty equivalents risk premiums of net present value are described in the study. The study found that neither the 15, 30, or the 80 MMGPY facilities would be feasible in Texas. The facilities have little chance of economic success under the best scenario ($ 0. 30 /gal) and all have a zero percent chance of maintaining beginning equity...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{accounting}} sense, assets are recorded on the left-hand side (debit) of asset accounts, {{because they are}} typically shown on the left-hand side of the accounting equation (A=L+SE/OE).

40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} Kolhapur district of Maharashtra. The study showed {{a reduction in the}} operational efficiency of the selected PACS during the post-economic reform period as against the pre-economic reform period. The operational efficiency was measured in respect of various liquidity ratio, profitability ratios and financial leverage ratios. Not only the selected societies showed a decline in their current ratio, rate of return on assets, return on <b>owner’s</b> <b>equity</b> and marginal efficiency of capital (MEC) but also higher dependency on lender’s capital for their finances. This dependency was seen to be higher in the case of ‘A’ graded society. Nonetheless, ‘A’ graded society showed an improvement in its permanent capital during the latter period as against the former period. On the other hand, permanent capital position of ‘B’ graded society had declined during the latter period. Further, in the case of ‘A’ graded society there was not much improvement in the net worth, and in fact the share of net worth in its total liability had declined in the post-economic reform period. The declining share of net worth had caused an increase in debt-asset ratio of this society during the latter period as against the former period. In fact, among various ratios, the most important ratio estimated in this study was the return on <b>owner’s</b> <b>equity.</b> The estimated return on <b>owner’s</b> <b>equity</b> of the selected societies were seen to fall sharply during the post-economic reform period. Since the return on <b>owner’s</b> <b>equity</b> is a function of as to how efficiently a firm manages its assets, the net profit margin on sales and the degree of financial leverage, a reduction in return on equity of the selected societies could, therefore, be considered as a sign of reduction in the efficiency of the societies in managing their assets and liabilities, and also income and expenditure pattern during the latter period as against the former period. ...|$|R
