50|$|An {{opto-isolator}} {{contains a}} source (emitter) of light, almost always a near {{infrared light-emitting diode}} (LED), that converts electrical input signal into light, a closed optical channel (also called dielectrical channel), and a photosensor, which detects incoming light and either generates electric energy directly, or modulates electric current flowing from an external power supply. The sensor can be a photoresistor, a photodiode, a phototransistor, a silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) or a triac. Because LEDs can sense light in addition to emitting it, construction of symmetrical, bidirectional opto-isolators is possible. An <b>optocoupled</b> solid state relay contains a photodiode opto-isolator which drives a power switch, usually a complementary pair of MOSFETs. A slotted optical switch contains a source of light and a sensor, but its optical channel is open, allowing modulation of light by external objects obstructing the path of light or reflecting light into the sensor.|$|E

40|$|The Pierre Auger Observatories (PAO) for {{the highest}} Energy Cosmic Rays will make use of both the Cherenkov and Air Fluorescence techniques. Surface Detectors (SD) and Fluorescence Detectors (FD) will have to operate in a desert type {{environment}} during at least 15 years. In order to avoid dust deposition, due to electrostatics, and other practical inconveniencies derived from biasing the cathode with a negative potential, the 15, 000 PMTs of the FD would have {{to operate in the}} grounded cathode configuration. Despite the fact that the anodes will remain at high voltage with respect to ground, the DC anode current, wich varies with background light, will have to be recorded. We have developed a current monitoring system based on a novel <b>optocoupled</b> feedback circuit that allows sensitive, linear, and temperature independent measurements of the DC anode current.

40|$|The Fluorescence Detector of the Pierre Auger Cosmic Ray Observatory {{will provide}} a {{measurement}} of the parameters of Extended Air Showers {{in the range from}} 10 19 eV to 10 21 eV. An array of 20 22 PMT's is placed at the focal surface of a large-aperture telescope thus forming one of the 30 detector modules. The shape of the signal generated by each PMT is variable, depending mostly on the geometry of the Air Shower as seen by the Detector; after analog processing the waveforms will be sampled at a rate of 10 MHz with 12 bit resolution. We have developed an analog signal processor to achieve best energy and time resolution, low noise and low cost. The Head Electronics provides an active bias network for the PMT's, which keeps the gain constant even in presence of large DC background light from the night sky: this DC level is measured by means of a built-in <b>optocoupled</b> linear circuit. The pulse signal is sent through a twisted pair to the Analog Front-End Board. At this stage a compr [...] ...|$|E

The renewable energy that produced by solar {{could be used in}} supplying electricity to electrical equipment as well as becoming an alternative source apart from the available energy supplied by the utility. The main objective of this project is to supply the electrical energy to aquarium pump. Besides that, the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is used to increase the power conversion efficiency of solar panel. Fuzzy logic controller is one of the MPPT method is used in this project and sun tracking system was added in this project to increase the power absorption by the solar panel. This sun tracking system embedded with light dependent resistor (LDR) which acts as a light sensor while the microcontroller is used for receiving and analysing input signal from LDR and sending the output signal to the DC motor. DC motor will be the medium for moving the solar panel towards the direction of the sun. The purpose of moving the solar panel towards the direction of the sun is to increase the rate of sunlight absorption by the solar panel hence increasing the electrical energy produced by solar panel.

Control signal produced by Arduino Uno will be sent to <b>optocouple</b> circuit as to increase the suitable voltage value to control the MOSFET. This method also presenting real-time code of fuzzy logic in Arduino language for controlling ATmega 328 that contained in Arduino Uno board.
