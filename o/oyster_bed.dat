25|$|In some areas, a scallop dredge is used. This is a toothed bar {{attached}} to a chain bag. The dredge is towed through an <b>oyster</b> <b>bed</b> by a boat, picking up the oysters in its path. While dredges collect oysters more quickly, they heavily damage the beds, and their use is highly restricted. Until 1965, Maryland limited dredging to sailboats, and even since then motor boats can be used only on certain days of the week. These regulations prompted the development of specialized sailboats (the bugeye and later the skipjack) for dredging.|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} said that the site may have one of the highest levels of {{biodiversity}} in Western Europe. Other areas of natural interest include the [...] of Canvey Lake Local Nature Reserve owned by Castle Point Borough Council. The lake was used for salt-making during the Roman settlement of the island, and is also thought to have functioned as an <b>oyster</b> <b>bed.</b> At the eastern point of the island is the [...] Canvey Heights Country Park which was reclaimed from the Newlands landfill site that operated there between 1954–89. The park is the highest land elevation on the island and thus has wide views across the creeks and marshes and along the Thames. The environment supports an array of wildfowl such as skylarks, dark-bellied brent geese and grey plover.|$|E
2500|$|The 34th Infantry Regiment {{was ordered}} on May 24, 1864 on an {{expedition}} to Asheepo River, South Carolina to burn a railroad trestle across a marsh at that point. About 400 members of the black regiment were loaded onto the troop steamer Boston, including 1st Lieutenant George W. Brush and the men of his company. The men had been ferried out to the Boston by small boats and one was fastened to the ships stern. Sailing down the Asheepo River in fog and darkness the ship became stranded upon an <b>oyster</b> <b>bed.</b> The Confederates planted a battery of guns on the river bank and began shelling the Boston. Lieutenant Brush quickly assembled four volunteers and began transporting men from the Boston to shore with the one small boat available. His Medal of Honor citation reads as follows [...] "voluntarily commanded a boat crew, which went {{to the rescue of}} a large number of Union soldiers on board the stranded steamer Boston, and with great gallantry succeeded in conveying them to shore, being exposed during the entire time to heavy fire from a Confederate battery". Instrumental in attaining the Medal of Honor for Lieutenant Brush were the efforts of the unit's Chaplain Homer W. Moore.|$|E

50|$|Black drum larvae eat mostly zooplankton, {{and young}} black drum (less than 20 cm long) eat worms and small fish. Black drum are mostly bottom feeders, with adults eating mostly mollusks and crabs. In shallow water, {{they have been}} {{reported}} to feed with their heads down so that their tails show above the water surface. Their sensitive chin barbels help locate food, and strong pharyngeal teeth crush the shells of these preferred foods. It has been reported that, in captivity, large drum were able to eat more than two commercial-sized oysters per kilogram of body weight each day. This translates into the potential for a 20 kg drum (about 45 lb) to eat 40 oysters a day. Fishing advice for black drum along the east and southeast coasts of the United States often includes the suggestion to locate an <b>oyster</b> <b>bed.</b> However, this preference has also caused black drum to be a nuisance for those who raise oysters commercially. A group of black drum can do great damage to an <b>oyster</b> <b>bed</b> in a single day.|$|E
