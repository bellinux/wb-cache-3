5|$|At {{the time}} of its decommissioning, US16 started its run through Michigan at the Grand Trunk Western Railroad docks in Muskegon. The SS Milwaukee Clipper {{operated}} as a car ferry across Lake Michigan, connecting Muskegon to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where US16 continued to the west. From the docks, US16 and M-46 traveled concurrently south and then east through downtown Muskegon. At Peck Street, US16 turned south along Business US31 (Bus. US31). These two highways ran concurrently out <b>of</b> <b>town</b> <b>to</b> the south through Muskegon Heights to Norton Shores. There, the business loop ended at US31, and US16 joined the I-196 freeway headed east. (Later, the I-96 and I-196 designations west of Grand Rapids would be flipped, but at the time leading up to US16's decommissioning in the state of Michigan, this had not yet been approved.) The I-196/US16 freeway traveled southeast of Norton Shores through woodlands in rural Muskegon County parallel to the former US16 routing through Fruitport to Nunica in Ottawa County. The freeway turned more directly east in Nunica past the eastern terminus of M-104, and continued through more mixed forest and grassland terrain to serve the communities of Coopersville and Marne.|$|E
5|$|Burnett and Loco stop by {{a frozen}} lake to allow Loco to relieve himself, but he springs a trap, {{shooting}} the ice surrounding Burnett and leaving {{him to die}} in the freezing water. Loco rides to his hideout and convinces the rest of his gang to confront Silence. Determined to take Pauline by force, Pollicut attempts to rape her as his henchman, Martin, tortures Silence by burning his right hand. Silence overpowers Martin and kills Pollicut. Loco and his gang arrive to look for Silence, just as the outlaws appear at the edge <b>of</b> <b>town</b> <b>to</b> collect the provisions, having been previously advised to do so by Burnett. Deciding to use them to draw out Silence, the gang herds the bandits into the saloon and captures Pauline. Loco tells Pauline to have Silence duel with him – if Silence wins, the outlaws will be set free; if he wins, they will be killed.|$|E

5|$|Lee {{wanted to}} seize the high ground south of Gettysburg, {{primarily}} Cemetery Hill, which dominated the town, the Union supply lines, and the road to Washington, D.C., and he believed an attack up the Emmitsburg Road {{would be the best}} approach. He desired an early-morning assault by Longstreet's Corps, reinforced by Ewell, who would move his Corps from its current location north <b>of</b> <b>town</b> <b>to</b> join Longstreet. Ewell protested this arrangement, claiming his men would be demoralized if forced to move from the ground they had captured. And Longstreet protested that his division commanded by John Bell Hood had not arrived completely (and that Pickett's division had not arrived at all). Lee compromised with his subordinates. Ewell would remain in place and conduct a demonstration (a minor diversionary attack) against Culp's Hill, pinning down the right flank of the Union defenders so that they could not reinforce their left, where Longstreet would launch the primary attack {{as soon as he was}} ready. Ewell's demonstration would be turned into a full-scale assault if the opportunity presented itself.|$|E
