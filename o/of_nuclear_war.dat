Accused of rudeness and incompetence, {{he was also}} credited with ruining Soviet agriculture and bringing {{the world to the}} brink <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>war.</b> Khrushchev had become an international embarrassment when he authorized construction of the Berlin Wall, a public humiliation for Marxism–Leninism.|$|E
5|$|Reagan's {{concession}} speech {{emphasized the}} dangers <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>war</b> {{and the threat}} posed by the Soviet Union. Though he lost the nomination, he received 307 write-in votes in New Hampshire, 388 votes as an Independent on Wyoming's ballot, and a single electoral vote from a faithless elector in the November election from the state of Washington, which Ford had won over Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Cold War, B-52s {{and other}} US {{strategic}} bombers performed airborne alert patrols under code {{names such as}} Head Start, Chrome Dome, Hard Head, Round Robin, and Giant Lance. Bombers loitered at high altitude near {{the borders of the}} Soviet Union to provide rapid first strike or retaliation capability in case <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>war.</b> These airborne patrols formed one component of the US's nuclear deterrent, which would act to prevent the breakout of a large-scale war between the US and the Soviet Union under the concept of Mutually Assured Destruction.|$|E

5|$|A {{communications}} variant designated Tu-142MR ("Bear J") was {{the last}} production version of the Tu-142. It was tasked with long-range communications duties with Soviet ballistic missile submarines, a role {{similar to that of}} the Boeing E-6 Mercury. The Tu-142MR differed from the ASW Tu-142s in having less-sophisticated avionics, but had a long trailing wire radio aerial to relay messages to submerged Soviet submarines in times <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>war.</b> This was amongst the many distinctive features of the Tu-142MR that allows it to communicate with satellites, airborne and ground-based command posts, and submarines. The aircraft replaced the Ilyushin Il-80 in the airborne command and control role. Tu-142s are currently operated by the 76th Naval Aviation Regiment from Kipelovo. Other developments of the Tu-142 include the one-off Tu-142MRT maritime reconnaissance variant, and the unbuilt Tu-142MS missile-carrying variant.|$|E
5|$|After {{the mint}} closed, it {{performed}} {{a variety of}} functions for the Federal government. It was first downgraded to an assay office for the U.S. Treasury {{as it had been}} from 1876 to 1879. Then, in 1932, the assay office closed and the building was converted into a Federal prison, in which capacity it served until 1943. The Coast Guard then took over the building as a nominal storage facility, though in truth the structure was largely abandoned and left to decay until it was transferred to the state of Louisiana in 1965. During the Cold War, when many believed there to be a high risk <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>war,</b> the old Mint was considered to be the best fallout shelter in the city.|$|E
5|$|Urey {{actively}} campaigned {{against the}} 1946 May-Johnson bill because {{he feared that}} {{it would lead to}} military control of nuclear energy, but supported and fought for the McMahon bill that replaced it, and ultimately created the Atomic Energy Commission. Urey's commitment to the ideal of world government dated from before the war, but the possibility <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>war</b> made it only more urgent in his mind. He went on lecture tours against war, and became involved in Congressional debates regarding nuclear issues. He argued publicly on behalf of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, and was even called before the House Un-American Activities Committee.|$|E

5|$|In October 1962, the US and Soviet Union {{experienced}} the Cuban Missile Crisis, which brought the two superpowers {{to the edge}} <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>war</b> and prompted both Kennedy and Khrushchev to seek accelerated rapprochement. After years of dormant or lethargic negotiations, American and British negotiators subsequently forged a strong working relationship and with Soviet negotiators found common ground on test restrictions later in 1962. After years of pursuing a comprehensive ban, Khrushchev was convinced to accept a partial ban, {{partly due to the}} efforts of Soviet nuclear scientists, including Kurchatov, Sakharov, and Yulii Borisovich Khariton, who argued that atmospheric testing had severe consequences for human health. Khrushchev had been concerned by a partial ban due to the greater US experience in underground tests; by 1962, the US had conducted 89 such tests and the Soviet Union just two (the Soviet focus had been on cheaper, larger-yield atmospheric tests). For this reason, many in the Soviet weapons industry argued that a partial ban would give the US the advantage in nuclear capabilities. Khrushchev would later recount that he saw test-ban negotiations as a prime venue for ameliorating tensions after the crisis in Cuba.|$|E
