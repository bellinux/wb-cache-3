40|$|PURPOSE: We {{established}} a primate model {{to investigate the}} effects of the antileukocyte function associated antigen 1 (CD 11 a) mAb <b>odulimomab</b> (Imtix-Sangstad, Lyon, France) for preventing renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We randomly divided 34 Macaca cynomolgus monkeys into groups 1 and 2, which received a renal autograft after 2 hours of cold ischemia, and groups 3 and 4, which received the autograft after 24 hours of cold ischemia. Before cold ischemia all harvested kidneys were subjected to 30 to 45 minutes of warm ischemia. Groups 1 and 3 monkeys were treated with an antileukocyte function associated antigen 1 mAb before cold ischemia and then for 3 days, while groups 2 and 4 monkeys received an IgG 1 isotype control. In all groups renal function was investigated before warm ischemia and 72 hours after reperfusion. Serum creatinine and the leukocyte count were determined daily. Histological studies were done and lactoferrin was measured in the autotransplanted kidney 72 hours after reperfusion. RESULTS: A decrease in renal function was shown after 2 hours of cold ischemia with tubular necrosis and mild cell infiltration, while after 24 hours of cold ischemia there was severe renal failure with tubular and glomerular necrosis, and leukocyte infiltration. A significant improvement in renal function and decrease in kidney lactoferrin content was evident in group 1 compared to group 2 at 72 hours, while no significant difference was noted in groups 3 and 4. No difference in histological patterns was evident in treated and untreated animals. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence for the validity of this ischemia-reperfusion injury model in primates. The protective effects of antileukocyte function associated antigen 1 mAb on renal injury was not as dramatic as in rodent models but a significant improvement in renal function was observed in treated animals after 2 hours of cold ischemia...|$|E
