25|$|Thermal {{desorption}} is {{a technology}} for soil remediation. During the process a desorber volatilizes the contaminants (e.g. oil, mercury or hydrocarbon) {{to separate them}} from especially soil or sludge. After that the contaminants can either be collected or destroyed in an <b>offgas</b> treatment system.|$|E
2500|$|... {{frequently}} {{found in}} household waste and wastewater. In digestion facilities accepting these materials {{as a component}} of the feedstock, low-molecular-weight siloxanes volatilise into biogas. When this gas is combusted in a gas engine, turbine, or boiler, siloxanes are converted into silicon dioxide (SiO2), which deposits internally in the machine, increasing wear and tear. Practical and cost-effective technologies to remove siloxanes and other biogas contaminants are available at the present time. In certain applications, in situ treatment can be used to increase the methane purity by reducing the <b>offgas</b> carbon dioxide content, purging the majority of it in a secondary reactor.|$|E
50|$|The second {{principle}} of combustion management, however, {{is to not}} use too much oxygen. The correct amount of oxygen requires three types of measurement: first, active control of air and fuel flow; second, <b>offgas</b> oxygen measurement; and third, measurement of <b>offgas</b> combustibles. For each heating process there exists an optimum condition of minimal <b>offgas</b> heat loss with acceptable levels of combustibles concentration. Minimizing excess oxygen pays an additional benefit: for a given <b>offgas</b> temperature, the NOx level is lowest when excess oxygen is kept lowest.|$|E
40|$|Trace gaseous {{contamination}} {{in the cabin}} environment {{is a major concern}} for manned spacecraft, especially those designed for long duration missions, such as the International Space Station (ISS). During the design phase, predicting the European-built Columbus laboratory module s contribution to the ISS s overall trace contaminant load relied on "trace gas budgeting" based on material level and assembled article tests data. In support of the Qualification Review, a final <b>offgassing</b> test has been performed on the complete Columbus module to gain cumulative system <b>offgassing</b> data. Comparison between the results of the predicted <b>offgassing</b> load based on the budgeted material/assembled article-level <b>offgassing</b> rates and the module-level <b>offgassing</b> test is presented. The Columbus module <b>offgassing</b> test results are also compared to results from similar tests conducted for Node 1, U. S. Laboratory, and Airlock modules...|$|R
40|$|NH 3 is a {{degradation}} product of SA 9 T, a solid-amine sorbent developed by Hamilton Sundstrand, that is continually emitted into the gas stream being conditioned by this sorbent. NH 3 <b>offgassing</b> rates were measured using FTIR spectroscopy using a packed bed at similar contact times as <b>offgassing</b> tests conducted at Hamilton Sundstrand {{and at the}} Ames Research Center. The bed was challenged with moist air at several flow rates and humidities and NH 3 concentration of the effluent was measured for several hours. The NH 3 <b>offgassing</b> rates in open-loop testing were calculated from the steady state outlet NH 3 concentration and flow rate. NH 3 <b>offgassing</b> rates from SA 9 T {{were found to be}} influenced by the contact time with the adsorbent (flow rate) and by the humidity of the inlet gas stream, which are consistent with previous studies. Closed-loop vacuum-swing adsorption cycling rates verified that NH 3 <b>offgassing</b> continues when a constant source of water vapor is present...|$|R
40|$|Crewed {{spacecraft}} trace contaminant control employs both {{passive and}} active methods to achieve acceptable cabin atmospheric quality. Passive methods include carefully selecting materials of construction, employing clean manufacturing practices, and minimizing systems and payload operational impacts {{to the cabin}} environment. Materials selection and manufacturing processes constitute the first level of equipment <b>offgassing</b> control. An element-level equipment <b>offgassing</b> test provides preflight verification that passive controls have been successful. <b>Offgassing</b> test results from multiple International Space Station (ISS) habitable elements and cargo vehicles are summarized and implications for active contamination control equipment design are discusse...|$|R
50|$|There {{are only}} three basic options for <b>offgas</b> {{treatment}} available. The volatilized contaminants in the <b>offgas</b> can either be discharged to atmosphere, collected or destroyed. In some cases, both a collection and destruction system are employed. In addition to managing the volatilized components, the particulate solids (dust) that exit the desorber must also {{be removed from the}} <b>offgas.</b>|$|E
50|$|When a {{collection}} system is used, the <b>offgas</b> must be cooled to condense {{the bulk of}} the volatilized components into a liquid. The <b>offgas</b> will exit most desorbers in the 350-900 °F range. The <b>offgas</b> is then typically cooled to somewhere between 120 and 40 °F to condense {{the bulk of the}} volatilized water and organic contaminants. Even at 40 °F, there may be measurable amounts of non-condensed organics. For this reason, after the condensation step, further treatment of the <b>offgas</b> is usually required. The cooled <b>offgas</b> may be treated by carbon adsorption, or thermal oxidation. Thermal oxidation can be accomplished using a catalytic oxidizer, an afterburner or by routing the <b>offgas</b> to the combustion heat source for the desorber. The volume of gas requiring treatment for indirect fired desorbers is a fraction of that required for a direct fired desorber. This requires smaller air pollution control trains for the gaseous process vent emissions. Some thermal desorption systems recycle the carrier gas, thereby further reducing the volume of gaseous emissions.|$|E
5000|$|Circoheat- {{this process}} preheats iron ore fines to a {{temperature}} of 850 °C. The iron ore are introduced to a circulating fluidized bed where <b>offgas</b> from an Hlsmelt smelt reduction vessel is introduced to the reactor via an AFB. The <b>offgas</b> is then combusted with air to heat the ores.|$|E
50|$|Both {{the scent}} and what {{produces}} it vary somewhat in {{different kinds of}} cars. Most of the interior of an automobile consists of plastic held together {{with a number of}} adhesives and sealers. Such materials release volatile organic compounds, via outgassing or <b>offgassing.</b> These fumes are generally attributed mixtures of many different chemicals <b>offgassing</b> and to plasticizers, although their vapor pressures are very low and they are not considered volatile.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{likelihood}} that underfloor heating may add to <b>offgassing</b> and {{sick building syndrome}} in an environment, particularly when carpet {{is used as a}} flooring.|$|R
40|$|During the {{processing}} of the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB), segments at the Kennedy Space Center, an odor was detected around the solid propellant. An Industrial Hygiene survey was conducted to determine the chemical identity of the SRB <b>offgassing</b> constituents. Air samples were collected inside a forward SRB segment and analyzed to determine chemical composition. Specific chemical analysis for suspected <b>offgassing</b> constituents of the propellant indicated ammonia to be present. A gas chromatograph mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) analysis of the air samples detected numerous high molecular weight hydrocarbons...|$|R
50|$|Efficient {{process heating}} {{requires}} {{recovery of the}} largest possible part of a fuel’s heat of combustion into the material being processed. There are many avenues of loss {{in the operation of}} a heating process. Typically, the dominant loss is sensible heat leaving with the <b>offgas</b> (i.e., the flue gas). The temperature and quantity of <b>offgas</b> indicates its heat content (enthalpy), so keeping its quantity low minimizes heat loss.|$|E
50|$|Foam {{rubber and}} {{urethane}} foams <b>offgas</b> harmful fumes, and are highly flammable, {{so they are}} typically avoided in collection storage spaces.|$|E
50|$|The liquid {{from the}} gas {{separator}} vessel is routed into a fractionating column commonly called a stabilizer. The overhead <b>offgas</b> product from the stabilizer contains the byproduct methane, ethane, propane and butane gases produced by the hydrocracking reactions as explained in the above discussion of the reaction chemistry of a catalytic reformer, and it may also contain some small amount of hydrogen. That <b>offgas</b> is routed to the refinery's central gas processing plant for removal and recovery of propane and butane. The residual gas after such processing {{becomes part of the}} refinery's fuel gas system.|$|E
5|$|PDISs are {{intermediate}} {{stops at}} a depth above the depth at which the leading compartment for the decompression calculation switches from ongassing to <b>offgassing</b> and below {{the depth of the}} first obligatory decompression stop, (or the surface, on a no-decompression dive). The ambient pressure at that depth is low enough to ensure that the tissues are mostly <b>offgassing</b> inert gas, although under a very small pressure gradient. This combination is expected to inhibit bubble growth. The leading compartment is generally not the fastest compartment except in very short dives, for which this model does not require an intermediate stop.|$|R

Within the Haldanian logic of the model, at least three compartments are <b>offgassing</b> at the prescribed depth - the 5 and 10 minute half time compartments under a relatively high pressure gradient. Therefore, for decompression dives, the existing obligation is not increased during the stop.|$|R
50|$|Wood storage {{furniture}} is typically avoided, even if painted, as it <b>offgasses</b> harmful acids, while often used metal storage equipment is typically {{made out of}} steel that is powder-coated with an epoxy finish, which is more durable than an acrylic or polyester finish.|$|R
50|$|The {{system is}} {{flexible}} and has several processing options that have ready application in the petroleum refinery or petrochemical complex for managing {{a variety of}} sulfur-containing streams including sulfidic caustic, LPG, hydrotreater <b>offgas</b> and fuel gas.|$|E
50|$|Condensers and {{activated}} carbon {{may also be}} used to treat the <b>offgas</b> from thermal screw systems. Condensers may be either water-cooled or electrically cooled systems to decrease <b>offgas</b> temperatures to 100 °F to 140 °F. The efficiency of condensers for removing organic compounds ranges from 50% to greater than 95%. Noncondensible gases exiting the condenser are normally treated by a vapor-phase {{activated carbon}} treatment system. The efficiency of activated carbon adsorption systems for removing organic contaminants ranges from 50% to 99%. Condensate from the condenser is processed through a phase separator where the non-aqueous phase organic component is separated and disposed of or recycled. The remaining water is then processed through activated carbon and used to rehumidify treated soil.|$|E

50|$|The oxygen window {{does not}} {{increase}} {{the rate of}} <b>offgassing</b> for a given concentration gradient of inert gas, but it {{reduces the risk of}} bubble formation and growth which depends on the total dissolved gas tension. Increased rate of <b>offgassing</b> is achieved by providing a larger gradient. The lower risk of bubble formation at a given gradient allows the increase of gradient without excessive risk of bubble formation. In other words, the larger oxygen window due to a higher oxygen partial pressure can allow the diver to decompress faster at a shallower stop at the same risk, or at the same rate at the same depth at a lower risk, or at an intermediate rate at an intermediate depth at an intermediate risk.|$|R
5000|$|Chemicals (known as getters) {{to collect}} gases leaked through the {{membrane}} or <b>offgassed</b> from the membrane materials. These {{are added to}} VIPs with glass-fiber or foam cores, because cores with bigger pore size require a higher vacuum (less than about 1 mbar) during the planned service life.|$|R
50|$|Most common {{plastics}} contain {{chlorinated compounds}} and plasticizers, which can migrate out and harm objects. Polyethylene and polyester are considered archival plastics {{because they do}} not <b>offgas</b> harmful chemicals, but they can produce static electricity in a low RH, so they should be avoided around friable objects.|$|E
50|$|The main {{fractionator}} <b>offgas</b> {{is sent to}} what {{is called}} a gas recovery unit where it is separated into butanes and butylenes, propane and propylene, and lower molecular weight gases (hydrogen, methane, ethylene and ethane). Some FCC gas recovery units may also separate out some of the ethane and ethylene.|$|E
50|$|As of 2005, {{roasting}} is {{no longer}} common in copper concentrate treatment, because its combination with reverberatory furnaces is not energy efficient and the SO2 concentration in the roaster <b>offgas</b> is too dilute for cost-effective capture. Direct smelting is now favored, e.g. using the following smelting technologies: flash smelting, Isasmelt, Noranda, Mitsubishi or El Teniente furnaces.|$|E

50|$|Unlike many {{foam-in-place}} polyurethane foams, it is nonflammable and non-toxic. As it is water-based, it offgasses {{water vapour}} while curing, requiring ventilation {{and in some}} cases an dehumidifier. It cures more slowly than organic foams. However, it does not <b>offgas</b> volatile organic compounds as many organic foams do. Like cement, it is water-soluble until cured, but after curing it is water-resistant, but water-permeable.|$|E
50|$|Thermal {{desorption}} is {{an environmental}} remediation technology that utilizes heat {{to increase the}} volatility of contaminants such {{that they can be}} removed (separated) from the solid matrix (typically soil, sludge or filter cake). The volatilized contaminants are then either collected or thermally destroyed. A thermal desorption system therefore has two major components; the desorber itself and the <b>offgas</b> treatment system.|$|E
