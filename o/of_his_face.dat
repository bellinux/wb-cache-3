5|$|Arnold Schwarzenegger's facial {{likeness}} {{was utilized}} via CGI, with a mold <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> made in 1984 scanned {{to create the}} digital makeup.|$|E
5|$|Cimabue {{achieves}} a masterful handling of colour; medieval churches {{tended to be}} extremely colourful, with frescoed walls, painted capitals, and gold leaf paintings. Pale tonalities dominate, with the main contrast found in the dark areas of Christ's hair and beard, which are utilised to make the features <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> stand out more, and position his head as the focal point.|$|E
5|$|The {{television}} series Jackass {{is referred to}} frequently by Peter and his neighbors, and is the principal reason that they try to do stunts. Johnny Knoxville cameoes and takes a shotgun blast which blows off part <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> In the episode, while being launched off a ramp and flying through the air, Peter wears the costume from The Greatest American Hero and sings the series' theme song.|$|E

50|$|All {{publicity}} {{photographs of}} Mr Lordi have <b>his</b> <b>face</b> concealed with <b>his</b> mask and stage makeup. However, many tabloids have published fake photos <b>of</b> <b>his</b> unmasked <b>face.</b> A real published photograph <b>of</b> <b>his</b> unmasked <b>face</b> {{was taken in}} the early 1990s, {{as the chairman of}} Kiss Army Finland.|$|R
50|$|In the children's novel The Phantom Tollbooth, {{the regular}} dodecahedron {{appears as a}} {{character}} {{in the land of}} Mathematics. Each <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>faces</b> wears a different expression—e.g. happy, angry, sad—which he swivels to the front as required to match his mood.|$|R
5|$|Croneman {{claims to}} be the mightiest barbarian of the {{northern}} tribes and honorary chief of the savage bezerkers of Nid. Known also as Amoron, the Wombat, he is a slayer, a reaver, a corsair, a usurper, and a conqueror. Depicted as resembling Schwarzenegger, he is also a bodybuilder with a very silly accent. On first meeting Croneman, Thrud slices him in half with a sword. When Croneman returns to join a group of mercenaries fighting The Black Currant in Thrud the Destroyer, he is depicted with a line of sutures running down the middle <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> and chest.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the threat}} of imprisonment, Mysterion unmasks himself, showing the {{television}} viewers only the portion <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> that looks similar to almost all of Mr. Garrison's 4th grade class. The crowd, however, is shocked to learn Mysterion's identity and, much to the regret of all except Coon, who says that he knew who Mysterion was, even calling him out on it at one point (though this helps the audience little as Cartman claimed that practically everyone in his class was Mysterion at times), Mysterion is hauled to prison. With Professor Chaos, General Disarray and Mysterion defeated, Cartman now perceives {{that he is the}} superhero in South Park and that every town should have a Coon like him.|$|E
5|$|During the {{subsequent}} exchange of strikes, Silva landed a direct right hook on Jackson's face, stunning Jackson and sending him backpedaling towards the ropes. Silva closed {{the distance and}} secured a Muay Thai clinch. From here, Silva landed approximately 5 knee strikes to Jackson's head, causing him {{to fall into the}} ropes, unconscious and with blood pouring out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> Silva was declared the winner by Knockout at 3:26 of the 2nd round to remain the Pride Middleweight Champion.|$|E
5000|$|Also in 1961, comedian Jimmy Edwards {{promoted}} a tea-shop band 'The Burke Adams Tea-Time Three', {{who had a}} record judged a hit on Juke Box Jury, in [...] "The Face of Enthusiasm", part <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>Faces</b> <b>of</b> Jim comedy series.|$|R
5000|$|Reloj de sol (Sundial). In one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>faces</b> {{there is}} date, 1795, {{that could be}} the date when it was built. There were only two sundials in the old Spanish colony: one in Santo Domingo and another in Bánica.|$|R

5|$|Kakashi was {{originally}} created by Kishimoto to be a harsh teacher but the author decided to avoid that. Instead, he {{made him more}} generous to calm his students in difficult situations {{to the point of}} giving him feminine traits. Kakashi's design gave Kishimoto difficulties as a result of having most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> covered and as a result it was difficult to show his emotions. For the anime series, he is voiced by Kazuhiko Inoue in Japanese and Dave Wittenberg in the English dub.|$|E
5|$|Marko, age 300, {{rode the}} 160-year-old Šarac by the {{seashore}} towards Mount Urvina when a vila {{told him that}} he was going to die. Marko then leaned over a well and saw no reflection <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> on the water; hydromancy confirmed the vilas words. He killed Šarac so the Turks would not use him for menial labor, and gave his beloved companion an elaborate burial. Marko broke his sword and spear, throwing his mace far out to sea before lying down to die. His body was found seven days later by Abbot Vaso and his deacon, Isaija. Vaso took Marko to Mount Athos and buried him at the Hilandar Monastery in an unmarked grave.|$|E
5|$|The Brute Man is a 1946 American {{film noir}} horor thriller film {{starring}} Rondo Hatton as the Creeper, a murderer seeking revenge {{against the people}} he holds responsible for the disfigurement <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> Directed by Jean Yarbrough, the film features Tom Neal and Jan Wiley as a married pair of friends the Creeper blames for his deformities. Jane Adams also starred as a blind pianist for whom the Creeper tries {{to raise money for}} an operation to restore her vision.|$|E

5|$|The {{exterior}} iconography {{includes two}} notable whimsical elements. A downspout {{on the east}} wall features a relief of a bulldog head; a decades-old myth relates that Cram placed it there to recognize Yale University, whose mascot is the bulldog. (Cram was not a Yale alumnus and in fact did not attend college, so {{it is unclear what}} interest he might have had promoting Yale.) A sculptor who worked on the chapel during its construction placed small carvings <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> and Cram's at the bottoms of crockets flanking the main entrance; Cram is identifiable by his glasses.|$|E
5|$|Willis has {{appeared}} on the Late Show with David Letterman several times throughout his career. He filled in for an ill David Letterman on his show February 26, 2003, when {{he was supposed to}} be a guest. On many of his appearances on the show, Willis stages elaborate jokes, such as wearing a day-glo orange suit in honor of the Central Park gates, having one side <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> made up with simulated buckshot wounds after the Harry Whittington shooting, or trying to break a record (parody of David Blaine) of staying underwater for only twenty seconds.|$|E
5|$|Adult males enter a {{state of}} {{increased}} testosterone known as musth. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth {{at the age of}} 15, but it is not very intense until they are older than 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24 do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25–35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls appear to enter musth during the dry season (January–May), while older bulls go through it during the wet season (June–December). The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid secreted from the temporal gland that runs down the side <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> He may urinate with his penis still in his sheath, which causes the urine to spray on his hind legs. Behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling and waving only one ear at a time. This can last from a day to four months.|$|E

5|$|Elections {{were held}} in May 1963, pitting Kenyatta's KANU against KADU, the Akamba People's Party, and various {{independent}} candidates; the former were victorious with 83 seats out of 124. On 1 June 1963, Kenyatta {{was sworn in as}} prime minister of the autonomous Kenyan government. He was the country's first Prime Minister to come from its indigenous population. Kenya remained a monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state. In November 1963, Kenyatta's government introduced a law making it a criminal offence to disrespect the Prime Minister, with exile as a punishment. Kenyatta's personality became a central aspect of the creation of the new state. In December, Nairobi's Delaware Avenue was renamed Kenyatta Avenue, and a bronze statue of him was erected beside the country's National Assembly. Photographs of Kenyatta were widely displayed in shop windows, and a likeness <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> was also printed on the new currency. In 1964, Oxford University Press published a collection of Kenyatta's speeches under the title of Harambee!.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, Baroš {{was accused}} of making a racist gesture towards his Cameroonian {{opponent}} Stéphane Mbia during Lyon's match against Rennes on 18 April. After having been fouled by Mbia several times, Baroš held his nose in front of Mbia and waved his hand as if to waft away an unpleasant smell. In the ensuing controversy, Baroš insisted that his gesture {{was not intended to}} be racist in any way, and he was only trying to tell Mbia to get out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> and leave him alone. Baroš and Mbia were brought before an official disciplinary hearing of the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP), which ruled that Baroš was innocent of racist behaviour, but he was nevertheless suspended for the remaining three games of the season for unsportsmanlike conduct. The end of the season saw Lyon win the league title, but nonetheless manager Houllier left the club.|$|E
5|$|In the First Test in Sydney, with England captain Douglas Jardine again {{employed}} Bodyline. This involved constant intimidatory short-pitched leg-side bowling with a leg-cordon {{to catch}} balls fended {{off by the}} batsman, {{in an attempt to}} curtail Donald Bradman, generally regarded as the best batsman ever, from scoring. McCabe came to the wicket on the first day, the score at 3/82 with Bill Woodfull, Bill Ponsford and Jack Fingleton already dismissed, and Bradman not playing due to illness. Having warned his parents, who were watching him in Test cricket for the only time, not to jump the fence if he was hit, McCabe took guard. Jardine had deployed seven men on the leg-side, usually with five close catchers and two men patrolling the boundary for hook shots. McCabe hooked the first ball he received from Bodyline spearhead Harold Larwood for a boundary. After Kippax fell with the score at 87, McCabe and Vic Richardson added 129 before Richardson fell. McCabe reached stumps at 127 not out with the total 6/290. His innings was marked by dangerous cutting and compulsive hooking of short-pitched deliveries in front <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> unfazed by the repeated body blows which hit his teammates.|$|E

5|$|Investigating one of {{a series}} of {{large-scale}} power outages, Indiana electrical lineman Roy Neary experiences a close encounter with a UFO, when it flies over his truck and lightly burns the side <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> with its bright lights. The UFO, joining a group of three other UFOs, is pursued by Neary and three police cars, but the spacecraft fly off into the night sky. Roy becomes fascinated by UFOs, much to the dismay of his wife, Ronnie. He also becomes increasingly obsessed with subliminal, mental images of a mountain-like shape and begins to make models of it. Jillian also becomes obsessed with sketching a unique-looking mountain. Soon after, she is terrorized in her home by a UFO which descends from the clouds. The presence of the UFO energy field makes every appliance in Jillian's house malfunction and Barry is abducted by unseen beings.|$|E
5|$|Lack of {{patronage}} led to Pentland folding his businesses {{and taking a}} job in 1930 as a pilot with Australian National Airways (ANA), a new airline founded by Charles Kingsford Smith and Charles Ulm. By 1932, ANA was in trouble as well, and Pentland left to set up as a dairy farmer on a property he bought at Singleton. Within two years, drought forced him to sell the land and he returned to earning his living as a pilot, instructing at aero clubs in Queensland and New South Wales. By late 1937, he was again employed as a transport pilot in New Guinea, where {{he was known as}} a practical joker who liked to hold a map in front <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> in apparent short-sightedness and ask his passengers if they could see a landing ground anywhere. He returned to Australia after war was declared in September 1939.|$|E
5|$|Michael Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American {{singer who}} spent over four {{decades in the}} public eye, first as a child star with The Jackson 5, and later as a solo artist, during which time he went through various image changes. Starting in the mid-1980s, {{it became clear that}} Jackson's {{appearance}} was changing dramatically. The shape <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> particularly his nose, triggered widespread speculation of extensive cosmetic surgery. His skin tone became much lighter. Although Jackson, a black man, was diagnosed with the skin disorder vitiligo, which results in white patches on the skin, and said that he had not purposely bleached his skin but had used makeup to even out his skin tone, it was also widely suggested that his lighter skin tone was partly due to skin bleaching.|$|E
