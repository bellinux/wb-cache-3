However, he continued playing with non-league clubs; a brief spell with Canvey Island reunited him with former Colchester and Ipswich player Neil Gregory. Canvey Island released him and he moved <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> even shorter stay with Grays Athletic, who signed him alongside Carl Leaburn. This was followed by a move back to Ipswich and into management.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} six episodes, the show had five corners, or parts, which started with opening {{greetings}} from the hosts {{and went on to}} thoughts and impressions that listeners had about the show. This moved <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> informal talk between the hosts, followed by a section where entries previously submitted by listeners concerning their enthusiasm for Key were read by the hosts. The fourth corner concerned answering questions that had been submitted by listeners, and the final corner had Orito playing the flute; listeners could submit suggestions for songs he was to play. Two more corners were added starting with the seventh broadcast. The first corner added concerns scary stories that the hosts can tell themselves, or read from submissions by listeners, and was added partly because Hinoue enjoys such stories. The second corner added deals with submissions by listeners describing a new fictional character, and Hinoue takes these submissions and forms a new fictional character out of combining elements from multiple submissions together. During the broadcasts, tracks from the soundtracks released under Key Sounds Label play in the background.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Mavis starts dating {{the equally}} shy Jerry Booth (Graham Haberfield), {{but it remains}} platonic. Jerry dies {{of a heart attack}} in 1975 before being able to express his romantic intentions. She meets {{salesman}} Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin) the following year. They date, but the relationship is strained by Derek's interfering mother, who believes that Mavis is not good enough for her son. The relationship remains non-committal until 1983, when another man competes for Mavis's hand, the artistic Victor Pendlebury (Christopher Coll). Mavis is torn as she likes both but chooses Derek in the end. On their wedding day in 1984 Mavis has second thoughts about marrying Derek and jilts him at the altar. Her guilt turns to indignation when she learns that Derek– feeling the same way she does– did not attend the ceremony either. Derek goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> unhappy marriage with Angela Hawthorne (Diane Fletcher), but in 1986 he begins wooing Mavis again, realizing he made a mistake when he let her go. Mavis eventually decides Derek is the man for her and the couple marry in September 1988. The other residents of Coronation Street consider Mavis and Derek something of a joke, but neither care as they are genuinely in love. They spend evenings reading aloud to each other and discussing the events of the day. They remain happy despite the occasional problem, but their happiness is cut short in 1997 when Derek dies suddenly of a heart attack after a road rage incident. Devastated, at his funeral Mavis chastises those who mocked her marriage over the years.|$|E

40|$|A domain {{specific}} language (DSL) enables {{designers to}} rapidly specify and implement systems {{for a particular}} domain, yielding designs {{that are easy to}} understand, reason about, re-use and maintain. However, there is usually a significant overhead in the required infrastructure <b>to</b> map such <b>a</b> DSL <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> programmable logic device. In this paper, we present a mapping of an existing DSL for the networking domain <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> platform FPGA by embedding the DSL into an existing language infrastructure. In particular, we will show that, using few basic concepts, we are able <b>to</b> achieve <b>a</b> successful mapping of the DSL <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> platform FPGA and create a re-usable structure that also makes it easy to extend the DSL. Finally we will present some results of mapping the DSL <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> platform FPGA and comment on the resulting overhead...|$|R

Yau's long collaborative friendship with Hamilton, which started after Yau learned of the latter's work on the Ricci flow, is also mentioned.|$|E

Operating from various homeports in Maine, Levi Woodbury accumulated an outstanding record of aiding ships in distress in her regular winter patrols. She also served briefly as USS Woodbury during the Spanish–American War.

25|$|A clip-on tuner clips <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> instrument—such as {{onto the}} {{headstock}} of a guitar or the bell of a trombone. A vibration sensor {{built into the}} clip tranmits the instrument vibrations to the tuning circuitry. The absence of a microphone makes these tuners immune to background noise, so musicians can tune in noisy environments, including while other musicians are tuning. The clip-on tuner was invented in 1995 by Mark Wilson of OnBoard Research Corporation, which marketed it as The Intellitouch Tuner Model PT1.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the females}} {{initiate}} courtship, {{female and male}} cardinalfish are mutually selective. Females have been observed courting larger males more intensively. Even when they {{are already in the}} process of courting one male, they often moved <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> intruder male if it is larger than the original. Females have also been observed producing larger eggs for larger, hence more ‘attractive,’ males. Females are also able to increase egg size even after the onset of egg maturation if they encounter a new, larger male to brood its eggs.|$|E

25|$|Further {{groundbreaking}} {{work was}} carried out by William Harvey, who published De Motu Cordis in 1628. Harvey made a detailed analysis of the overall structure of the heart, going <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> analysis of the arteries, showing how their pulsation depends upon the contraction of the left ventricle, while the contraction of the right ventricle propels its charge of blood into the pulmonary artery. He noticed that the two ventricles move together almost simultaneously and not independently like had been thought previously by his predecessors.|$|E
25|$|Voltage-controlled {{amplifier}} (VCA) – After {{the signal}} generated by one (or {{a mix of}} more) VCOs has been modified by filters and LFOs, and its waveform has been shaped (contoured) by an ADSR envelope generator, it then passes on {{to one or more}} voltage-controlled amplifiers (VCAs). A VCA is a preamp that boosts (amplifies) the electronic signal before passing it <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> external or built-in power amplifier, as well as a means to control its amplitude (volume) using an attenuator. The gain of the VCA is affected by a control voltage (CV), coming from an envelope generator, an LFO, the keyboard or some other source.|$|E

Two wickets from Kaneria did not stop them, as Law hit an unbeaten 13 to power <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> eight-wicket victory, Sutcliffe ending with 80 not out as Lancashire won by eight wickets.|$|E
40|$|Total {{pyruvate}} dehydrogenase complex {{activity is}} low in white adipose tissue during the suckling period and increases markedly at weaning <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> high-carbohydrate diet. This is concomitant {{with an increase in}} the E 1 alpha, E 1 beta and E 2 subunit protein concentration and their respective mRNAs, suggesting a pretranslational control of this phenomenon. The most marked change is seen for the E 1 alpha subunit (17 -fold increase in protein concentration). The changes in pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity and subunit abundance induced by weaning <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> high-carbohydrate diet are precluded if the animals are weaned <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> high-fat diet, suggesting that the nutritional and/or related hormonal changes rather than a developmental stage are responsible for the observed adipose-tissue pyruvate dehydrogenase complex pattern...|$|R
