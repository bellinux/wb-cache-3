40|$|This article aims to {{show that}} Prince Eugene's mindset has been partly {{misunderstood}} so far due to, first, lack of analysis of his library; and, secondly, lack <b>of</b> contextualisation <b>of</b> <b>Eugene's</b> collecting practices within his broader military, political, artistic, and intellectual milieus. A multifaceted figure such as Eugene begs from a disciplinary approach. After a historiographical survey of his 'many Eugenes' that historiographical traditions have portrayed, this article provides a preliminary analysis of the composition <b>of</b> <b>Eugene's</b> fifteen-thousand volume library as it was on his death in 1736. Next, this article compares the size and composition <b>of</b> <b>Eugene's</b> library to other contemporary collections. Further it tackles the place of Jansenism and Gallicanism within it, and it relates both to Eugene's Neapolitan proteges...|$|R

5|$|In the 1840s, {{a serial}} format {{known as the}} roman-feuilleton was highly popular in France, and the most {{acclaimed}} expression of it was the socialist writing <b>of</b> <b>Eugène</b> Sue. Balzac wanted to challenge Sue's supremacy, and prove himself the most capable feuilleton author in France. Writing quickly and with intense focus, Balzac produced La Cousine Bette, one of his longest novels, in two months. It was published in Le Constitutionnel {{at the end of}} 1846, then collected with a companion work, Le Cousin Pons, the following year.|$|E

5|$|The {{newspaper}} {{is owned by}} the Baker family <b>of</b> <b>Eugene,</b> and members of the family were in charge of nearly all departments within the paper until 2015, when, {{for the first time in}} 88 years, someone who is not a member of the Baker family took the reins as publisher and editor.

5|$|Although The Raft of the Medusa retains {{elements}} of the traditions of history painting, in both its choice of subject matter and its dramatic presentation, it represents {{a break from the}} calm and order of the prevailing Neoclassical school. Géricault's work attracted wide attention from its first showing and was then exhibited in London. The Louvre acquired it soon after the artist's death at the age of 32. The painting's influence {{can be seen in the}} works <b>of</b> <b>Eugène</b> Delacroix, J. M. W. Turner, Gustave Courbet, and Édouard Manet.|$|E
5|$|Behind the Horseshoe Cloister is the Curfew Tower, one of {{the oldest}} {{surviving}} parts of the Lower Ward and dating from the 13th century. The interior of the tower contains a former dungeon, and the remnants of a sally port, a secret exit for the occupants in a time of siege. The upper storey contains the castle bells placed there in 1478, and the castle clock of 1689. The French-style conical roof is a 19th-century attempt by Anthony Salvin to remodel the tower in the fashion <b>of</b> <b>Eugène</b> Viollet-le-Duc's recreation of Carcassonne.|$|E
5|$|Christy {{could have}} {{graduated}} in 1940, {{but could not}} then be a teaching assistant, and this would have left him jobless and without income. In 1941, Oppenheimer found him a post at the physics department at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). In May 1941, he married Dagmar von Lieven. They had two sons: Thomas Edward (Ted), born in 1944, and Peter Robert, born in 1946. IIT paid Christy $200 per month to teach 27 hours per week for 11 months per annum. To keep abreast of developments in physics, he attended seminars at the University of Chicago. This {{brought him to the}} attention <b>of</b> <b>Eugene</b> Wigner, who hired him for the same money that IIT was paying him as a full-time research assistant, commencing in January 1942.|$|E

5|$|In Italy, Archduke John went {{up against}} Napoleon's stepson Eugène. The Austrians beat back several bungled French assaults at the Battle of Sacile in April, causing Eugène {{to fall back}} on Verona and the Adige River, but Eugène regrouped and {{launched}} a more mature offensive that expelled the Austrians from Northern Italy again. By the time of Wagram, Eugène's forces had joined Napoleon's main army. In Dalmatia, Marmont, under the nominal command <b>of</b> <b>Eugène,</b> was fighting against General Stoichewich. Marmont launched a mountain offensive on 30 April, but this was repulsed by the Grenzer troops. Like Eugène, however, Marmont did not let an initial setback dictate the tempo of the conflict. He went back on the offensive and joined Napoleon at Wagram.|$|E
5|$|Maria Amélia {{was born}} on 1 December 1831 in Paris and christened Maria Amélia Augusta Eugênia Josefina Luísa Teodolinda Elói Francisco Xavier de Paula Gabriela Rafaela Gonzaga.

Through her father, Maria Amélia {{was a member of}} the Brazilian branch of the House of Braganza (Portuguese: Bragança), and was referred to by the honorific Dona (Lady) from birth. She was the granddaughter of the Portuguese King JoãoVI. Maria Amélia's mother was the daughter <b>of</b> <b>Eugène</b> de Beauharnais, Duke of Leuchtenberg and the stepson of Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte of France. Eugène was married to Princess Augusta, eldest daughter of King MaximilianI of Bavaria.|$|E
