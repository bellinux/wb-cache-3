5|$|October 9, 1804 – The Storm of October 1804 strikes near Atlantic City as {{a strong}} Category 2 <b>or</b> <b>weak</b> Category 3 hurricane, sinking or {{beaching}} many ships in the Mid–Atlantic. The hurricane later produces a snow storm in New England.|$|E
5|$|A pH {{indicator}} is a {{weak acid}} <b>or</b> <b>weak</b> base that changes colour {{in the transition}} pH range, which is approximately pKa±1. The design of a universal indicator requires a mixture of indicators whose adjacent pKa values differ by about two, so that their transition pH ranges just overlap.|$|E
5|$|In {{particle}} physics, {{the weak}} interaction (the weak force <b>or</b> <b>weak</b> nuclear force) is {{the mechanism of}} interaction between sub-atomic particles that causes radioactive decay and thus plays {{an essential role in}} nuclear fission. The theory of the weak interaction is sometimes called quantum flavourdynamics (QFD), in analogy with the terms quantum chromodynamics (QCD) dealing with the strong interaction and quantum electrodynamics (QED) dealing with the electromagnetic force. However, the term QFD is rarely used because the weak force is best understood in terms of electro-weak theory (EWT).|$|E

5|$|Hunting large whales {{usually takes}} several hours. Killer whales {{generally}} choose to attack young <b>or</b> <b>weak</b> animals; however, {{a group of}} five or more may attack a healthy adult. When hunting a young whale, a group chases it and its mother until they wear out. Eventually, they separate the pair and surround the calf, preventing it from surfacing to breathe, drowning it. Pods of female sperm whales sometimes protect themselves by forming a protective circle around their calves with their flukes facing outwards, using them to repel the attackers. Rarely, large killer whale pods can overwhelm even adult female sperm whales. Adult bull sperm whales, which are large, powerful and aggressive when threatened, and fully grown adult blue whales, which are possibly too large to overwhelm, are not believed to be prey for killer whales.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September28, reports {{indicated}} that Juan would make landfall either as a tropical storm or marginal Category1 hurricane. Weather broadcasts {{up to that time}} gave every indication that the storm would weaken prior to landfall. By 6 p.m. ADT (2100 UTC), additional warnings had been issued since Juan was expected to make landfall as a strong Category1 <b>or</b> <b>weak</b> Category2 hurricane. Most businesses in the areas affected were closed on Sundays, which meant that preparations could not be made at the last minute. Although no large-scale evacuations were made, local evacuations for low-lying areas were issued on the evening of September 28. In all, several hundred people were affected by these evacuations. Utility workers also stood on standby before the storm hit, preparing for large-scale power outages.|$|E
5|$|The Fire Emblem series' Weapon Triangle {{mechanic}} {{is featured}} again, {{in which the}} three main close-combat weapons are strong <b>or</b> <b>weak</b> against each other: axes are strong against lances, lances are strong against swords, and swords are strong against axes. Other similar mechanics exist, such as fire magic being more damaging to some beasts, and arrows being more effective against airborne enemies. Weapon durability decreases over time, with weapons eventually breaking when used {{a certain number of}} times. Weapons have different levels of strength, with its assigned letter (E to A and S) denoting the level of skill required to wield it. Weapons forged at Base can also be customized with a unique name. Magic is governed by a similar system to the Weapons Triangle; fire is weak to wind, wind is weak to thunder, and thunder is weak to fire.|$|E

25|$|When {{there are}} many small <b>or</b> <b>weak</b> studies of an intervention, a {{statistical}} meta-analysis {{can be used to}} co-ordinate the studies' results and to draw a stronger conclusion about the outcome of the treatment. This can be an important contribution to the establishment of a foundation of evidence about an intervention.|$|E
25|$|If clause {{expansion}} is restricted by connectedness (either strong <b>or</b> <b>weak),</b> its application produces a tableau in which substitution can applied {{to one of}} the new leaves, closing its branch. In particular, this is the leaf containing the literal of the clause that unifies with the negation of a literal in the branch (or the negation of the literal in the parent, in case of strong connection).|$|E
25|$|Tisha B'Av and Yom Kippur are {{the major}} fasts and are {{observed}} from sunset to the following day's dusk. The remaining four fasts are considered minor and optional fasting is only observed from sunrise to dusk.

Abnormal crowding has been observed in schizophrenia, with different groups reporting stronger <b>or</b> <b>weaker</b> crowding effects.|$|R
5|$|This lists {{all of the}} Category5 hurricanes in {{the order}} in which they formed. Only 1994's Hurricane Emilia and 2006's Hurricane Ioke have reached Category5 {{intensity}} more than once; that is, by weakening into a Category4 <b>or</b> <b>weaker</b> storm and later re-strengthening to a Category5 storm.|$|R
25|$|There {{are other}} spirits {{designated}} as kami as well. For example, the guardian {{spirits of the}} land, occupations, and skills; spirits of Japanese heroes, men of outstanding deeds or virtues, {{and those who have}} contributed to civilization, culture, and human welfare; those who have died for the state or the community; and the pitiable dead. Not only spirits superior to man can be considered kami; spirits that are considered pitiable <b>or</b> <b>weak</b> have also been considered kami in Shinto.|$|E
25|$|Removal {{of surface}} dirt and {{deposits}} is beneficial {{for the health}} and longevity of an object because it will prevent the dirt from becoming drawn into the body. Dust and grease may be held on the surface loosely by electrostatic forces <b>or</b> <b>weak</b> chemical bonds and are easily removed. Some deposits, such as calcium salts, can be strongly attached a ceramic surface especially if the surface is unglazed. There are two main methods in which ceramics are cleaned and treated: mechanically and chemically.|$|E

40|$|The {{straw man}} fallacy {{consists}} in inappropriately constructing <b>or</b> selecting <b>weak</b> (<b>or</b> comparatively <b>weaker)</b> {{versions of the}} opposition 2 ̆ 7 s arguments. We will survey the three forms of straw men recognized in the literature, the straw, weak, and hollow man. We will then {{make the case that}} there are examples of inappropriately reconstructing stronger versions of the opposition 2 ̆ 7 s arguments. Such cases we will call iron man fallacies...|$|R
25|$|Chromatic {{aberration}} is {{used during}} a duochrome eye test {{to ensure that}} a correct lens power has been selected. The patient is confronted with red and green images and asked which is sharper. If the prescription is right, then the cornea, lens and prescribed lens will focus the red and green wavelengths just in front, and behind the retina, appearing of equal sharpness. If the lens is too powerful <b>or</b> <b>weak,</b> then one will focus on the retina, and the other will be much more blurred in comparison.|$|E
25|$|Bengal tigers {{have been}} known to take other predators, such as leopards, wolves, jackals, foxes, crocodiles, Asiatic black bears, sloth bears, and dholes as prey, {{although}} these predators are not typically a part of their diet. They rarely attack adult elephants and rhinoceroses but such extraordinarily rare events have been recorded. The British-Indian hunter and naturalist Jim Corbett also described an incident of two tigers fighting and killing a large bull elephant. If injured, old <b>or</b> <b>weak,</b> or their normal prey is becoming scarce, they may even attack humans and become man-eaters.|$|E
25|$|Even if {{the host}} does develop antibodies, {{protection}} {{might not be}} adequate; immunity might develop too slowly {{to be effective in}} time, the antibodies might not disable the pathogen completely, or there might be multiple strains of the pathogen, not all of which are equally susceptible to the immune reaction. However, even a partial, late, <b>or</b> <b>weak</b> immunity, such as a one resulting from cross-immunity to a strain other than the target strain, may mitigate an infection, resulting in a lower mortality rate, lower morbidity, and faster recovery.|$|E
