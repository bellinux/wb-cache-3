25|$|Firs – a manservant, aged 87. An aging eccentric, Firs {{considers}} the emancipation of the Russian serfs a disaster, and talks nostalgically {{of the old}} days when everybody admired their masters and owners, such as Gayev's parents and grandparents. His senility is a source of much of the play's poignancy, symbolizing the decay <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>order</b> into muttering madness.|$|E

25|$|Cortés first {{settled in}} Coyoacán, {{but decided to}} rebuild the Aztec site to erase all traces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>order.</b> He did not {{establish}} a territory under his own personal rule, but remained loyal to the Spanish crown. The first Spanish viceroy arrived in Mexico City fourteen years later. By that time, the city had again become a city-state, having power that extended far beyond its borders.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1640s, England erupted in civil war. The Puritan-dominated Parliamentarians emerged victorious, and the Crown was supplanted by the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell in 1653. Its failure led to {{restoration}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>order</b> under Charles II. Emigration to New England slowed significantly in these years. In Massachusetts, a successful merchant class {{began to develop}} that was less religiously motivated than the colony's early settlers.|$|E
25|$|The revolutionary {{atmosphere}} that {{had followed the}} declaration of the Helvetic Republic dissipated rapidly in 1799. Responsible for this sudden shift was the War of the Second Coalition, during which the battlefront ran directly through the Aare Valley and hundreds of French soldiers were quartered in houses in the town. When the French withdrew from Switzerland {{for a number of}} months in 1802, the supporters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>order</b> had the upper hand. During the ensuing Stecklikrieg farmers from the surrounding area plundered the town's armory. Following the Act of Mediation, signed by Napoléon Bonaparte on March 19, 1803, Brugg was definitively made a district capital in the newly arranged Canton of Aargau.|$|E

25|$|As the Napoleonic Wars were {{approaching}} their end in 1814, the old political order of Europe {{was to a}} considerable extent restored at the Congress of Vienna after years of fighting and revolution, during which the Church had been persecuted as an agent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>order</b> and abused {{under the rule of}} Napoleon. With the political climate of Europe changed, and with the powerful monarchs who had called for the suppression of the Society no longer in power, Pope Pius VII issued an order restoring the Society of Jesus in the Catholic countries of Europe. For its part, the Society of Jesus made the decision at the first General Congregation held after the restoration to keep the organization of the Society the way that it had been before the suppression was ordered in 1773.|$|E
25|$|Lancaster also hosts other Plain Anabaptist groups. As of 2000, {{there are}} about 3,000 Old Order Mennonites of the Groffdale Conference who drive black top buggies instead of the grey top buggies of the Amish in Lancaster county. Other buggy-using Old Order Mennonites in Lancaster County are subgroups of the Stauffer Mennonites with 283 baptized members and the Reidenbach Mennonites with 232. There are about 4,000 members of the car-driving Weaverland Old Order Mennonite Conference. A {{congregation}} of 83 members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Order</b> River Brethren lives there as well as 84 members of the Reformed Mennonite Church who have retained the most conservative form of Plain dress of all Plain groups. There are 74 members of the Old German Baptist Brethren in Lancaster County. The Amish comprise around 5.7% of the total population.|$|E
25|$|The Amish do {{not usually}} educate their {{children}} past the eighth grade, {{believing that the}} basic knowledge offered {{up to that point}} is sufficient to prepare one for the Amish lifestyle. Almost no Amish go to high school and college. In many communities, the Amish operate their own schools, which are typically one-room schoolhouses with teachers (usually young, unmarried women) from the Amish community. On May 19, 1972, Jonas Yoder and Wallace Miller <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Order</b> Amish, and Adin Yutzy of the Conservative Amish Mennonite Church, were each fined $5 for refusing to send their children, aged 14 and 15, to high school. In Wisconsin v. Yoder, the Wisconsin Supreme Court overturned the conviction, and the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed this, finding the benefits of universal education were not sufficient justification to overcome scrutiny under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.|$|E

5000|$|Nedham was notable as an {{advocate}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commercial interests <b>of</b> emerging capitalism in preference to <b>the</b> pillars <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>order.</b> In 1652, he wrote that commercial interest [...] "is <b>the</b> true zenith <b>of</b> every state and person...though clothed never so much with <b>the</b> specious disguise <b>of</b> religion, justice and necessity". Consistent with this outlook, Nedham translated John Selden's Mare Clausum (1636) as <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> Dominion or Ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea (1652).|$|R
25|$|At Segovia, on 23 May 1221, Ferdinand III granted all {{the rights}} and castles, {{including}} Monfragüe, to the Order of Calatrava, effectively merging the smaller order into the larger. This command was not perfectly followed through and initially Mauricio, the bishop of Burgos, and Tello Téllez de Meneses, the bishop of Palencia, aided by the archdeacon of Valpuesta, were assigned to arbitrate ongoing disputes. Yet as late as 1225 there were conflicts between the brothers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>Order</b> of Monfragüe and the master and knights of Calatrava. On March 1 that year, Honorius III sent a commission under the bishop, dean, and archdeacon of Burgos to resolve the dispute. They failed and the dispute was brought before Rome, where the Calatravan delegates failed to appear. In May 1234 Gregory IX nonetheless sent it to a tribunal {{in an attempt to}} reach compromise before judging in favour of Monfragüe. On 5 June 1234 Gregory ordered the possessions of Monfragüe be restored to those members of the Order who opposed the merger with Calatrava. This {{does not seem to have}} taken place and the merger seems to have been complete by 1245, when Ferdinand could grant Calatrava Priego de Córdoba in exchange for the castle of Monfragüe (among others).|$|E

The king is credited with authoring the general provisions, and Kołłątaj, with giving the work its final shape.

Potocki wanted to make the parliament (Sejm) the most powerful of the state's institutions, and Kołłątaj, for a [...] "gentle" [...] social revolution, enfranchising other classes in addition to the till-then dominant nobility, but doing so without a violent overthrow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>order.</b>|$|E
