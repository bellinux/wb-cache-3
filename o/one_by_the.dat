5|$|A {{number of}} press reports came {{out during the}} Ethics Committee's work that purported to reveal aspects of the {{investigations}}. Chair Heflin was upset by the leaks and two investigations into them were held, <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> General Accounting Office {{acting on behalf of}} the committee and <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Senate's Temporary Special Independent Counsel. Neither report reached a conclusive finding or directly implicated anyone in the leaks. The special counsel report, released in 1992, ascribed partisanship as the motive for the leaks and said they were intended to hurt DeConcini, Riegle, and Cranston; it also gave an inference that McCain and his staff were responsible for key leaks.|$|E

40|$|Riffles and pools have {{important}} roles for a river ecology and river environment. It {{is useful to}} develop a method for creation of riffle and pool. Our final goal is a development of technical method for creation of riffles and pools by means of over flow from weir. As first stage of it, we have studied that the characteristics of scours created by over flow from a sharp crested weir and an inclined weir. The main {{results of this study}} are as follows; (1) The maximum scour depths <b>by</b> <b>the</b> inclined weir are small compared with <b>ones</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sharp crested weir when the gradients of inclined weir are mild. However, <b>ones</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> inclined weir approach <b>ones</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sharp crested weir as the gradient of inclined weir become steep.

5|$|A Danish {{fleet of}} 20 ships under Admiral Niels Juel put to sea in March 1676, and on 29 April his forces landed on Gotland, which surrendered. The Swedish fleet was ordered out on 4 May with 23 {{warships}} of over 50 guns, 21 {{of less than}} 50 and 16 minor supporting vessels manned by about 12,000 men, but encountered adverse winds and was delayed until 19 May. Juel had by then left Visby, the main port on Gotland, to join up with a smaller Danish-Dutch force at Bornholm, between {{the southern tip of}} Sweden and the northern coast of Germany. Together they intended to cruise between Scania and the island of Rügen to stop Swedish troops from landing on the island and reinforcing Swedish Pomerania. On 25–26 May the two fleets fought the indecisive battle at Bornholm. The Swedish force was superior in numbers but was unable to inflict any serious losses, and two of the fleet's fireships were captured, <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> allies and the other by a Brandenburg squadron headed for Copenhagen.|$|E

5|$|A {{circulation}} {{began to}} form on June 18 {{in the eastern}} Gulf of Mexico, prompting gale warnings. It was declared Subtropical Depression One the same day. The depression made landfall {{on the morning of}} June 18 just north of Spring Hill, Florida and gained subtropical storm status over land. The storm was classified as Subtropical Storm <b>One</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> National Hurricane Center, as the rule was not to name subtropical storms. The subtropical storm moved to the northeast and crossed the Outer Banks of North Carolina on June 19. Even though the minimum central pressures remained low, the circulation expanded and became distorted. The subtropical storm peaked at 70mph winds (110km/h) on June 18, but did not reach its minimum pressure until June 20, when it dropped to 984mbar (29.07inHg). The subtropical storm was declared an extratropical storm near the Canadian Maritimes the same day.|$|E
5|$|Archaea can be {{infected}} by double-stranded DNA viruses that are unrelated {{to any other}} form of virus and have a variety of unusual shapes, including bottles, hooked rods, or teardrops. These viruses have been studied in most detail in thermophilics, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Two groups of single-stranded DNA viruses that infect archaea have been recently isolated. One group is exemplified by the Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 ("Pleolipoviridae") infecting halophilic archaea and the other <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Aeropyrum coil-shaped virus ("Spiraviridae") infecting a hyperthermophilic (optimal growth at 90–95°C) host. Notably, the latter virus has the largest currently reported ssDNA genome. Defenses against these viruses may involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences that are related to the genes of the viruses.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of this growth, on 9 April 2006 the OCC began to include {{download}} sales alongside physical sales when compiling the UK Albums Chart. That same day, the OCC also launched a dedicated weekly chart based solely on sales of album downloads in the UK. Approximately 64,000 albums were downloaded during the week of the chart's launch, of which just under 2,000 were of This New Day by the British band Embrace, the chart's first number <b>one.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> end of 2006 nearly 2.8million album downloads had been purchased, which comprised 1.8% of the total album sales. The following year the UK's online music revenue grew to , which made the nation Europe's largest consumer of online music. By the end of decade over 25million albums had been downloaded and the market comprised 12.5% of total album sales. Following Embrace, a further 99 artists topped the chart; fifteen did so with two albums. Including original soundtracks and compilations, a total of 121 albums reached number one during the 2000s. , the UK Album Download Chart continues to be published each week by the OCC.|$|E

5|$|Despite its ferocity, {{the fire}} was mostly ineffectual. Confederate shells often {{overshot}} the infantry front lines—in some cases because of inferior shell fuses that delayed detonation—and the smoke covering the battlefield concealed that fact from the gunners. Union artillery chief Brig. Gen. Henry J. Hunt had only about 80 guns available to conduct counter-battery fire; the geographic features of the Union line had limited areas for effective gun emplacement. He also ordered that firing cease to conserve ammunition, but to fool Alexander, Hunt ordered his cannons to cease fire slowly {{to create the illusion}} that they were being destroyed one by <b>one.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> time all of Hunt's cannons ceased fire, and still blinded by the smoke from battle, Alexander fell for Hunt's deception and believed that many of the Union batteries had been destroyed. Hunt had to resist the strong arguments of Hancock, who demanded Union fire to lift the spirits of the infantrymen pinned down by Alexander's bombardment. Even Meade was affected by the artillery—the Leister house was a victim of frequent overshots, and he had to evacuate with his staff to Powers Hill.|$|E
5|$|France's {{intervention}} in the coup was openly applauded by the Central African Republic, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Madagascar, Niger, and Upper Volta.

The matter was not discussed at the next meeting of the Council of Ministers of the OAU, held on 24 February–29 February in Lagos.

5|$|In 2010, {{international}} {{rail travel}} was liberalised by new European Union directives, designed {{to break up}} monopolies {{in order to encourage}} competition for services between countries. This sparked interest among other companies in providing services in competition to Eurostar and new services to destinations beyond Paris and Brussels. The only rail carrier to formally propose and secure permission for such a service up to now is Deutsche Bahn, which intends to run services between London and Germany and the Netherlands. The sale of High Speed <b>One</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British Government having effectively nationalised LCR in June 2009 is also likely to stimulate competition on the line.|$|E

5|$|Mehmed II ordered Hadım Suleiman Pasha, Beylerbey (or governor) of Rumelia, {{to invade}} Moldavia – an Ottoman army of about 120,000 strong broke into Moldavia in late 1475. Wallachian troops also joined the Ottomans, while Stephen {{received}} support from Poland and Hungary. Outnumbered three to <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> invaders, Stephen {{was forced to}} retreat. He joined battle with Hadım Suleiman Pasha at Podul Înalt (or the High Bridge) near Vaslui on 10 January 1475. Before the battle, he had sent his buglers to hide behind the enemy fronts. When they suddenly sounded their horns, they caused such a panic among the invaders that they fled from the battlefield. Over the next three days, hundreds of Ottoman soldiers were massacred and the survivors retreated from Moldavia.|$|E

5|$|On 5 August 1936, the United States {{had made}} it known that it would follow a policy of non-intervention, but did not {{announce}} it officially. This isolationism on the Spanish war would later be identified as disastrous by Under-Secretary of State Sumner Welles. Five days later, the Glenn L. Martin Company enquired whether the government would allow the sale of eight bombers to the Spanish Republican Air Force; the response was negative. It also confirmed it would not take part in several mediation attempts, including <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Organization of American States. Mexico soon became the first nation to openly support the Republicans. On 15 August, the United Kingdom banned exports of war material to Spain. Neurath also agreed to the pact, and suggested that volunteers (many of whom would eventually form the International Brigades) be included. Italy similarly agreed, signing on 21 August after a determined diplomatic offensive by Britain and France. Although a surprising reversal of views, it has been put down to the growing belief that countries could not abide by the agreement anyway. Admiral Raeder urged the German government either to back the Nationalists more completely, and bring Europe {{to the brink of}} war, or to abandon them. On the 24th, Germany signed.|$|E
5|$|Parsifal {{far exceeds}} {{the other members}} of the canon in the number of {{performances}} it has received at Bayreuth. It is the only work to have had three festival seasons (1882, 1883 and 1884) dedicated solely to its staging, and was performed every season from 1882 until the start of World War II, with the exception of 1896 when Cosima first revived the Ring. Most of these performances were of the original production, which received 205 performances before a new staging was introduced in 1934.

5|$|Sheerness {{is in the}} {{parliamentary}} constituency of Sittingbourne and Sheppey. Since the constituency's creation in 1997 until 2010 the Member of Parliament was Derek Wyatt of the Labour Party. At the 2010 general election, Gordon Henderson of the Conservative Party won the seat. Before 1997, Sheppey and Sittingbourne {{were part of the}} constituency of Faversham. Sheerness is in the local government district of Swale. The town is split between the two local government wards of Sheerness East and Sheerness West, which have four of the forty-seven seats on the Swale Borough Council. At the 2007 local elections, three of those seats were held by the Labour Party and <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Sheppey First party. Swale Borough Council is responsible for running local services, such as recreation, refuse collection and council housing; Kent County Council is responsible for education, social services and trading standards. Both councils are involved in town planning and road maintenance. From 1894 to 1968, Sheerness formed its own local government district, Sheerness Urban District, and lay within the administrative county of Kent. Over much of the past century, the Labour Party has received the most support in Sheerness, mainly due to the town's industrial nature. As early as 1919, the town had four Labour councillors; Faversham elected its first only in 1948.|$|E
