5|$|Although the game's story diverges {{in several}} places and {{features}} a completely different protagonist, several levels mirror passages from Lovecraft's novella The Shadow over Innsmouth. It also contains elements of the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game's campaign Escape from Innsmouth, such as the Marsh Refinery raid. A major sub-plot {{of the game is}} inspired by Lovecraft's novella The Shadow <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Time.</b>|$|E
5|$|Draw on time: In {{games with}} a time control, the game is drawn if a player is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and the {{opponent}} has no theoretical possibility to checkmate the player.|$|E

5|$|Win on time: In {{games with}} a time control, a player wins if the {{opponent}} runs <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> even if the opponent has a much superior position, {{as long as the}} player still has a theoretical possibility to checkmate the opponent.|$|E
5|$|A wait {{of three}} years {{occurred}} between the release of Goblet of Fire and the fifth Harry Potter novel, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. This gap led to press speculation that Rowling had developed writer's block, speculations she denied. Rowling later said that writing the book was a chore, {{that it could have}} been shorter, and that she ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and energy as she tried to finish it.|$|E
5|$|Also {{frequently}} performed is the Fifth Symphony (Op. 50, 1921–22) presenting another {{battle between}} the forces of order and chaos. A snare drummer is given the task of interrupting the orchestra, playing ad libitum and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> as if to destroy the music. Performed by the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, it caused a sensation, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia. In the Sixth Symphony (without opus number), written 1924–25, and subtitled Sinfonia Semplice (Simple Symphony), the tonal language seems {{similar to that in}} Nielsen's other symphonies, but the symphony develops into a sequence of cameos, some sad, some grotesque, some humorous.|$|E

50|$|<b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Time’s</b> Abyss is a fantasy-science fiction {{novel by}} American writer Edgar Rice Burroughs, {{the third of}} his Caspak trilogy. The {{sequence}} {{was first published in}} Blue Book Magazine as a three-part serial in the issues for September, October and November 1918, with <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Time's</b> Abyss forming the third installment. The complete trilogy was later combined for publication in book form under the title of The Land That Time Forgot (the title of the first part) by A. C. McClurg in June 1924. Beginning with the Ace Books editions of the 1960s, the three segments have usually been issued as separate short novels.|$|R

5|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, when {{alternative}} rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as {{a pioneer of}} the genre. The band then released its two most commercially successful albums, <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Time</b> (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound and catapulted it to international fame. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was {{a return to a}} more rock-oriented sound, but still continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members.|$|E
5|$|In the serial, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor (Peter Davison) and {{his companions}} Tegan Jovanka (Janet Fielding) and Vislor Turlough (Mark Strickson) encounter a group of god-like immortals who are racing historical Earth sailing vessels through space, crewed by humans they had plucked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> {{in an attempt to}} win the prize of the titular enlightenment. Turlough is {{under the control of the}} Black Guardian (Valentine Dyall), but struggles with the Guardian's orders to kill the Doctor.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister Franjo Gregurić advised Tuđman to {{implement}} Špegelj's plan. According to General Anton Tus, Tuđman ordered the ZNG to capture JNA barracks on 12 September, but rescinded the order the next day. The order was reinstated on 14 September after Tus pleaded with Tuđman to re-authorize action, {{arguing that the}} ZNG was running <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> The same day, the ZNG and the Croatian police blockaded and cut utilities to all JNA facilities it had access to, beginning the Battle of the Barracks. This action comprised blockades of 33 large JNA garrisons in Croatia, and numerous smaller facilities, including border posts, and weapons and ammunition storage depots.|$|E

In one such study, a losing cricket put back into the ring will only go back to fight one <b>out</b> <b>of</b> ten <b>times.</b> If crickets are shaken and thrown in the air repeatedly, they will fight again six <b>out</b> <b>of</b> ten <b>times.</b>|$|R
5|$|Scattered {{around each}} level are gold rings. Collecting 100 rings rewards the player {{with an extra}} life. Rings act as a layer of {{protection}} against hazards: if Sonic holds at least one ring when he collides with an enemy or dangerous obstacle, he will survive. However, all rings in his possession will be scattered; they flicker and disappear {{in a few seconds}} if not picked up again. If he is hit without holding any rings, he loses a life. Shields and temporary invincibility can be collected to provide additional layers of protection, but certain hazards, such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> will cause Sonic to lose a life regardless of rings or other protection.|$|E
5|$|While {{trying to}} close the doors, the player must avoid certain hazards. Mario will lose a life if he touches an enemy, runs <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> runs {{off the edge of}} the floor he is on, or if all the doors are open. Enemies in the game are mostly regular Mario series creatures, such as Goombas, Koopas, Boos and their variations. The {{opponent}} on the last stage of each hotel is one of the Koopalings, who each use different methods to attack Mario.|$|E
5|$|After time expires, the chaser {{is given}} {{two minutes to}} catch the team by {{correctly}} answering {{a new series of}} questions, with each correct answer moving him one space along the board. If the chaser answers incorrectly or passes, the clock is stopped briefly and the team is given a chance to answer the question, which they may confirm among themselves before answering. A correct answer pushes the chaser back one space, or moves the team ahead by one if he has not moved on to the gameboard. An incorrect answer provides no movement for the chaser at all. Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to answer questions. If the chaser runs <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> before catching the team, the team splits the banked money equally, but if he catches them before time expires, the team leaves with no money. During celebrity episodes, if the chaser catches the team before time runs out, the team leaves with $15,000 divided equally.|$|E

5|$|Late in the fourth, Mark Ingram lost {{a fumble}} {{for the first}} time in his collegiate career, giving Tennessee {{possession}} at the Alabama 43 with 3:29 remaining in the game. The Vols drove the ball 43 yards in 2:10, culminating with an 11-yard Crompton touchdown pass to Gerald Jones to cut the gap to 12–10. The Vols followed with a successful onside kick attempt and regained possession of the ball at their own 41-yard line. After Tennessee was penalized five yards for a false start, Crompton completed a pass to Luke Stocker for 23 yards, to the Bama 27-yard line. With the clock ticking off the final seconds and Tennessee <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> outs, Crompton spiked the ball to stop the clock with four seconds left. This set up Lincoln for a 45-yard field goal attempt to win the game. However, Terrence Cody knocked his blocker over and broke through the line. He blocked Lincoln's field goal as time expired, preserving Alabama's 12–10 victory and perfect season. For their performances, Cody was named the SEC Defensive Lineman of the Week and Tiffin was named the SEC Special Teams Player of the Week.|$|E
5|$|Legend of Mana was {{designed}} as a 2D game, despite the PlayStation's 3D-focus, as the console could not handle the full 3D world Ishii envisioned where one could interact with natural shaped objects. Kawazu initially let Ishii have a relaxed schedule and budget, as Ishii had a great number of ideas he wanted in the game, but when the project began to get out of control and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> Kawazu tightened down the rest of the development schedule and convinced the Square executives to delay the game by two months—even though it had already been announced to the public—to allow it to be completed as Ishii envisioned. Kawazu has said that this experience taught him that his true skill in game development lay in working as a producer.|$|E
5|$|Louisville {{took over}} on offense needing {{to get a}} {{touchdown}} to regain a lead before the waning clock finally ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> After the Tech kickoff and a touchback, the Cardinals took over at their 20-yard line. Michael Bush ran for 10yards and a first down, and Hunter Cantwell scrambled for six more on a rushing play. Facing third down and needing four yards, Cantwell dropped back to pass for the first down. As the pass soared through the air, Tech defender James Anderson jumped and caught the ball, intercepting it. Still on his feet, Anderson quickly rushed the other way and, unimpeded, ran 39yards {{into the end zone}} for a Virginia Tech touchdown. The score and extra point energized Virginia Tech's offense and defense and gave the Hokies an 11-point lead—35–24—with 4:45 remaining in the game.|$|E

5|$|Peter Ackroyd {{believes}} {{that it is impossible}} to paraphrase the content of the poem; the poem is too abstract to describe the events and the action that make up the poem's narrative structure. However, the philosophical basis for the poem can be explained since the discourse on time is connected to the ideas within St. Augustine's Confessions. As such, there is an emphasis on the present moment as being the only time period that really matters, because the past cannot be changed and the future is unknown. The poem emphasizes that memory must be abandoned to understand the current world, and humans must realize that the universe is based on order. The poem also describes that although consciousness cannot be bound within time, humans cannot actually escape from time on their own. The scene beneath London is filled with the time-bound people who are similar to the spiritually empty populace of The Hollow Men; they are empty because they do not understand the Logos or the order of the universe. The conclusion of the poem emphasizes that God is the only one that is truly able to exist <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and have knowledge of all times and places, but humankind is still capable of redemption through belief in Him and His ability to save them from the bounds of the material universe.|$|E
5|$|Players must guide a {{boy scout}} through a 43-room mansion {{in order to}} obtain 16 keys and a {{combination}} before running <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> These unlock a safe containing the pills needed to save the mansion owner's life. It is necessary to jump onto platforms and evade enemies in order to progress. At the start of the game the player has three lives; a life is lost should the boy scout fall too far or come into contact with one of the mansion's servants or traps. Rooms contain doors that can be entered to move around the mansion, as well as push buttons and hazards. Pressing buttons can result in lifts being activated, platforms appearing or in an enemy appearing. One of the mansion's rooms is a corridor of eight doors with a large pair of eyes above them; this room acts as a maze. A tune is played continuously during play, but can be toggled on or off.|$|E
5|$|Populous: The Beginning {{takes place}} before {{the first two games}} in the series. The player {{controls}} the Blue tribe, pitted against the three enemy tribes which control most of the solar system. The player's destiny as Shaman is to become a deity; only by defeating all the enemies in the system can the player's shaman become omnipotent. The player begins on the planet furthest from the sun, and attacks each planet in sequence. Along the way, the Shaman can learn new skills and magic to defeat her (usually) much more powerful enemies. Victory requires the player to either destroy the opposition, or on occasion perform special actions. The player loses if his or her Shaman is killed and there are no remaining followers, if the Shaman is killed and there is no circle of reincarnation, or the player runs <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> on timed levels. Upon beating back the other tribes, the Shaman ascends to godhood, and further helps her people conquer the Matak, Chumara and Dakini in one final conflict.|$|E
