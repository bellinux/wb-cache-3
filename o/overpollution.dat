50|$|Sterling State Park was {{established}} {{in an effort to}} preserve the Lake Erie coastline after decades of pollutants from the Detroit River emptied into the region— killing off tremendous amounts of wildlife and leaving the lake largely uninhabitable. For quite some time, Sterling State Park was greatly polluted by river runoff from Detroit, and swimming in the water was not recommended and even illegal. After decades and millions of dollars spent, the region was cleaned up and partially restored. In the late 1990s, the Environmental Protection Agency declared the area to be an environmental concern due to the level of pollutants in Lake Erie and the River Raisin. When studying fish in the area, PCB levels increased 87% from the 1988 to 1998. The result of the <b>overpollution</b> came from the sudden industrial growth surrounding the River Raisin delta and Lake Erie. The largest of these industries include a Ford plant and the coal-burning Monroe Power Plant, both of which caused severe impacts on the ecosystem of the area. In September 1997, the Ford completed an environmental dredging project in the River Raisin and removed approximately 25,000 cubic yards (19,000 m³) of toxic PCB-contaminated sediment from the River Raisin.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, the {{globalisation}} {{complex and}} confused scenarios {{show that the}} industrialism cycle has arrived to an impasse; sustainable and long-lasting progress requests strong changeovers. The technology challenge needs solving the <b>overpollution</b> and over-consumption figures of the current industrialism: to that purpose the world ought to radically modify the political set-up moving to global village sustainable growth, ruled by &# 8249;the force of the law&# 8250; and turning to &# 8249;hyperdemocracy&# 8250;, to assuring balanced citizen/authority interplay...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} how a benevolent regulator should regulate a polluting export industry when the industry, having private information about its abatement efficiency, has {{an option to}} move its operations abroad, with a type-dependent outside option rent. The paper focuses on the case where outside option is negatively correlated with abatement efficiency, implying unilateral incentives for overstating abatement efficiency. Because lump-sum taxation is ruled out, rent will have a social cost which is also affected by foreign ownership to the industry. It is demonstrated that optimal regulation calls for excessive pollution among the participating types (relative to complete information), {{for the purpose of}} rent extraction, while types being excluded are the ones with the higher outside option (the least efficient types). We also demonstrate that with a higher foreign ownership share, the larger is the set of excluded types, while <b>overpollution</b> should be reduced...|$|E
