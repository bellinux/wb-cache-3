Kevin N. Laforest of the Montreal Film Journal commented in his September 2002 review that Cruz [...] "has been getting some really bad reviews for her recent American work, but I personally think that she's a more than decent actress, especially here, where she's charming, moving and always believable. [...] There's one shot in particular, where Cruz enters a room in a greenish glow, which is right out of Hitchcock's picture [...]" ...|$|E

[...] That same year, the studio was less successful {{in its efforts to}} promote <b>Open</b> <b>Your</b> Eyes, a tract on the dangers of venereal disease that featured Jack Warner's sole screen appearance. During this period, the studio earned few profits; and in 1920, the Warners secured a bank loan to settle outstanding debts. Shortly thereafter, the Warners relocated their production studio from Culver City, California, to Hollywood, where they purchased a lot on the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Bronson Avenue, known today as Sunset Bronson Studios. The new location and upgraded facilities did not significantly improve the studio's image, which remained defined by its low-budget comedies and racy films on declining morality.|$|E

[...] But the best {{performance}} of the album is definitely 'Like a Prayer'. The talented voices of the Glee cast, backed by a full choir, masterfully carry the lyrics to greater heights." [...] Mikael Wood from Entertainment Weekly gave it an [...] "A" [...] rating, explaining [...] "Sue hilariously revises the spoken-word bit on 'Vogue', and the Glee guys give a surprisingly tender reading of 'What It Feels Like for a Girl'.

[...] David Hiltbrand from Star Tribune gave a negative review of the EP saying that [...] "things go downhill as soon as Jane Lynch starts camping up the spoken portion of 'Vogue'.

Philip Borof from Bloomberg Television reviewed the concert in New York's Madison Square Garden and found it average, calling the crowd decked in various costumes as the [...] "most entertaining". Toronto Stars Ben Rayner appreciated the show, exclaiming [...] "hot damn, that was one hell of a show Gaga brought to the Air Canada Centre Sunday night and suddenly it doesn’t seem redundant to add one more voice to the Lady Gaga choir." [...] Mariel Concepción from Billboard felt that Gaga [...] "may be best known for her gaudy outfits and over-the-top stage shows, but at her hometown headlining debut at Madison Square Garden last night, the pop phenomenon proved she's a regular girl at heart." [...] The Seattle Times staff writer Marian Liu declared that as [...] "one of the most anticipated touring acts of the year, [...] stimulated the crowd's senses on Saturday night in a way few artists can. She brought spectacle and backed it up with soul." [...] The Guardian journalist Alexis Petridis reviewed the opening show of the European leg, and commented that [...] "it takes a certain je ne sais quoi to <b>open</b> <b>your</b> show doing something that looks suspiciously like mime on a rickety metal staircase while wearing an outfit with shoulderpads the size of the deck on a small aircraft carrier." ...|$|E
