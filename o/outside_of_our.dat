Supporters state that Hubble's discovery of nebulae <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> galaxy helped {{pave the way for}} future astronomers. Although some of his more renowned colleagues simply scoffed at his results, Hubble ended up publishing his findings on nebulae. This published work earned him an award titled the American Association Prize and five hundred dollars from Burton E. Livingston of the Committee on Awards.|$|E

Thus, Leavitt's discovery would forever change our picture of the universe, as it prompted Harlow Shapley to move our Sun from the center of the galaxy in the [...] "Great Debate" [...] and Edwin Hubble to move our galaxy from the center of the universe.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{examples}} from auditory perception research {{will be helpful}} in explaining {{the fact that our}} perceptual faculties naturally enhance and supplement our conscious experience. First, there is the [...] "cocktail party phenomenon" [...] (Moray, 1959). When someone is engaged in conversation with a group of people in a noisy room, but then they suddenly hear something or hear their name from across the room, when they were completely inattentive to the input before, that is the cocktail party phenomenon. This phenomenon also occurs with words associated with danger and sex. Although people may be inattentive to a portion of their environment, when they hear specific [...] "trigger" [...] words, their auditory capacities are redirected to another dimension of perceptual awareness. This shows that we do process information <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> immediate conscious experience. Similar to visual perception, auditory perception also enhances and supplements our experience by searching out and extracting meaningful information from our environment.|$|E
2500|$|Although in {{previous}} centuries noted astronomers were exclusively male, {{at the turn}} of the 20th century women began to play a role in the great discoveries. In this period prior to modern computers, women at the United States Naval Observatory (USNO), Harvard University, and other astronomy research institutions began to be hired as human [...] "computers," [...] who performed the tedious calculations while scientists performed research requiring more background knowledge. [...] A number of discoveries in this period were originally noted by the women [...] "computers" [...] and reported to their supervisors. For example, at the Harvard Observatory Henrietta Swan Leavitt discovered the cepheid variable star period-luminosity relation which she further developed into a method of measuring distance <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> solar system. Annie Jump Cannon, also at Harvard, organized the stellar spectral types according to stellar temperature. In 1847, Maria Mitchell discovered a comet using a telescope. According to Lewis D. Eigen, Cannon alone, [...] "in only 4 years discovered and catalogued more stars than all the men in history put together." ...|$|E
2500|$|Law {{professor}} and blogger Ann Althouse rejected the Everybody Draw Mohammed Day idea because [...] "depictions of Muhammad offend millions of Muslims who are {{no part of}} the violent threats." [...] James Taranto, writing in the [...] "Best of the Web Today" [...] column at The Wall Street Journal, also objected to the idea, not only because depicting Mohammed [...] "is inconsiderate of the sensibilities of others", but also because [...] "it defines those others—Muslims—as being <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> culture, unworthy of the courtesy we readily accord to insiders." [...] Bill Walsh of Bedford Minuteman wrote critically of the initiative, which seemed [...] "petulant and childish" [...] to him: [...] "It attempts to battle religious zealotry with rudeness and sacrilege, and we can only wait to see what happens, but I fear it won’t be good." [...] Janet Albrechtsen wrote in The Australian, [...] "As a cartoon, it was mildly amusing. As a campaign, it's crass and gratuitously offensive." [...] Writing for New York University's Center for Religion and Media publication, The Revealer, Jeremy F. Walton called the event a [...] "blasphemous faux holiday", which would [...] "only serve to reinforce broader American misunderstandings of Islam and Muslims".|$|E

The pulpit was in the centre of the church, and the clerk's desk diagonally across from it. The floor was boarded over, but a chill struck through from the stones below, and the people seemed to shiver through the service that preceded the election.

40|$|Instance-based {{learning}} theory (IBLT) has explained human decision-making in several decision tasks. IBLT works by retrieving past experiences (i. e., instances) using {{a subset of}} cognitive mechanisms from a popular cognitive architecture, ACT-R. Until recently, most IBLT models were built within the ACT-R architecture. However, due to an integrated view of cognition and ACT-R 2 ̆ 7 s complexity, {{it is difficult to}} distinguish between the specific contributions of ACT-R mechanisms used in IBLT from all the other mechanisms existent in ACT-R. Also, models built within the ACT-R architecture are often difficult to explain, communicate, and reuse in other systems. This research validates the main mechanisms of IBLT when used within ACT-R and when used in isolation, <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> ACT-R. <b>Our</b> results show that an IBLT model performs equally well in capturing human behavior within and <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> ACT-R, demonstrating the independence of these mechanisms from any complex interaction with other mechanisms in ACT-R. We discuss the implications <b>of</b> <b>our</b> results for a modular view of cognition...|$|R
