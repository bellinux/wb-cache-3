500|$|The Old Market Place {{is thought}} {{to stand on the}} site of the {{original}} town settlement. Now a registered conservation area it consists of a series of part timber-framed buildings echoing the wattle and daub constructions of the original houses and burgage plots. The cobblestone paving was replaced in 1896. The Buttermarket which stood in the area near the Old Market Place from the 17th century until the late 19th century was also the site for dispensing early local justice. A courtroom, stocks and whipping post saw public floggings take place there until the early 19th century. The whipping post and stocks were restored as a tourist attraction by local traders in the 1990s. However the Buttermarket area was also a site of religious importance, since prospective brides and grooms are thought to have declared their intentions here. In 1814 Thomas de Quincey described the Old Market Place in his Confessions of an English <b>Opium</b> <b>Eater</b> while travelling from Manchester to Chester. He noted how little the place had changed since his visit 14 years earlier at the age of three, and that [...] "fruits, such as can be had in July, and flowers were scattered about in profusion: even the stalls of the butchers, from their brilliant cleanliness, appeared attractive: and bonny young women of Altrincham were all tripping about in caps and aprons coquettishly disposed". Another of Altrincham's attractions is the historic market, set up over 700 years ago when the town was first established.|$|E

6000|$|The scholar shames us by his bifold[678] life. Whilst {{something}} {{higher than}} prudence is active, he is admirable; when common sense is wanted, {{he is an}} encumbrance. Yesterday, Cæsar[679] was not so great; to-day, Job[680] not so miserable. Yesterday, radiant with the light of an ideal world in which he lives, the first of men, and now oppressed by wants and by sickness, for which he must thank himself, none is so poor to do him reverence. He resembles the <b>opium</b> <b>eaters</b> whom travellers describe as frequenting the bazaars of Constantinople, who skulk about all day, the most pitiful drivellers, yellow, emaciated, ragged, sneaking; then at evening, when the bazaars are open, they slink to the opium-shop, swallow their morsel and become tranquil, glorious and great. And who has not seen the tragedy of imprudent genius struggling for years with paltry pecuniary difficulties, at last sinking, chilled, exhausted and fruitless, like a giant slaughtered by pins? ...|$|R
5000|$|Yet {{from the}} time of its publication, De Quincey's Confessions was criticized for {{presenting}} a picture of the opium experience that was too positive and too enticing to readers. As early as 1823, an anonymous response, Advice to <b>Opium</b> <b>Eaters,</b> was published [...] "to warn others from copying De Quincey." [...] The fear of reckless imitation was not groundless: several English writers — Francis Thompson, James Thomson, William Blair, and perhaps Branwell Brontë — were led to opium use and addiction by De Quincey's literary example. Charles Baudelaire's 1860 translation and adaptation, Les paradis artificiels, spread the work's influence further. One of the characters of the Sherlock Holmes story, The Man with the Twisted Lip (1891), is an opium addict who began experimenting with the drug as a student after reading the Confessions. De Quincey attempted to address this type of criticism. When the 1821 original was printed in book form the following year, he added an Appendix on the withdrawal process; and he inserted significant material on the medical aspects of opium into his 1856 revision.|$|R

2500|$|Much of {{the poem}} could have been {{influenced}} by Coleridge's opium dream or, as his friend and fellow poet Robert Southey joked, [...] "Coleridge had dreamed he had written a poem in a dream". If Coleridge's dream did originate ideas within the poem, then the dreams are related to those experienced by contemporary <b>opium</b> <b>eaters</b> and writers, Thomas de Quincey and Charles Pierre Baudelaire. It is possible that the dream affected Coleridge's later mood and caused him to enter into a depression, influencing the ideas in his writing that followed the dream night. Of these ideas, Coleridge's emphasised the vastness of the universe and his feeling overwhelmed by how little the universe seemed to him. Also, Charles Lamb provided Coleridge on 15 April 1797 with a copy of his [...] "A Vision of Repentance", a poem that discussed a dream containing imagery similar to those in [...] "Kubla Khan". The poem could have provided Coleridge {{with the idea of a}} dream poem that discusses fountains, sacredness, and even a woman singing a sorrowful song. The poem's use of original names and disorganised use of action can also be attributed to an opium induced state of mind. In terms of spelling, Coleridge's printed version differs from Purchas's spelling, which refers to the Tartar ruler as [...] "Cublai Can", and from the spelling used by Milton, [...] "Cathaian Can". His original manuscript (as reproduced above) spells the name [...] "Cubla Khan" [...] and the place [...] "Xannadu".|$|R
6000|$|After a day's repose, we were {{summoned by}} the Treasurer, {{early in the}} forenoon, to wait upon the Gerad Mohammed. Sword in hand, and {{followed}} by the Hammal and Long Guled, I walked to the [...] "palace," [...] and entering a little ground-floor-room {{on the right of}} and close to the audience-hall, found the minister sitting upon a large dais covered with Persian carpets. He was surrounded by six of his brother Gerads or councillors, two of them in turbans, the rest with bare and shaven heads: their Tobes, as is customary on such occasions of ceremony, were allowed to fall beneath the waist. The lower part of the hovel was covered with dependents, amongst whom my Somal took their seats: it seemed to be customs' time, for names were being registered, and money changed hands. The Grandees were eating Kat, or as it is here called [...] "Jat." [...] [37] One of the party prepared for the Prime Minister the tenderest twigs of the tree, plucking off the points of even the softest leaves. Another pounded the plant with a little water in a wooden mortar: of this paste, called [...] "El Madkuk," [...] a bit was handed to each person, who, rolling it into a ball, dropped it into his mouth. All at times, as is the custom, drank cold water from a smoked gourd, and seemed to dwell upon the sweet and pleasant draught. I could not but remark the fine flavour of the plant after the coarser quality grown in Yemen. Europeans perceive but little effect from it--friend S. and I once tried in vain a strong infusion--the Arabs, however, unaccustomed to stimulants and narcotics, declare that, like <b>opium</b> <b>eaters,</b> they cannot live without the excitement. It seems to produce in them a manner of dreamy enjoyment, which, exaggerated by time and distance, may have given rise to that splendid myth the Lotos, and the Lotophagi. It is held by the Ulema here as in Arabia, [...] "Akl el Salikin," [...] or the Food of the Pious, and literati remark that it has the singular properties of enlivening the imagination, clearing the ideas, cheering the heart, diminishing sleep, and taking the place of food. The people of Harar eat it every day from 9 A.M. till near noon, when they dine and afterwards indulge in something stronger,-- millet-beer and mead.|$|R
60|$|There are others, however, who {{are no more}} hypnotised by crystal- gazing than tea-drinking, or gardening, {{or reading}} a book, and who can still enjoy visions as {{beautiful}} {{as those of the}} <b>opium</b> <b>eater,</b> without any of the reaction. Their condition remains perfectly normal, that is, they are wide awake to all that is going on. In some way their fancy is enlivened, and they can behold, in the glass, just such vivid pictures as many persons habitually see between sleeping and waking, illusions hypnagogiques. These 'hypnagogic illusions' Pontus de Tyard described in a pretty sonnet, more than three hundred years ago. Maury, in his book on dreams has recorded, and analysed them. They represent faces, places, a page of print, a flame of fire, and so forth, and it is one of their peculiarities that the faces rapidly shift and alter, generally from beautiful to ugly. A crystal-seer seems to be a person who can see, in a glass, while awake and with open eyes, visions akin to those which perhaps the majority of people see with shut eyes, between sleeping and waking. {214} It seems probable that people who, when they think, see a mental picture of the subject of their thoughts, people who are good 'visualisers,' are likely to succeed best with the crystal, some of them can 'visualise' purposely, in the crystal, while others cannot. Many who are very bad 'visualisers,' like the writer, who think in words, not in pictures, see bright and distinct hypnagogic illusions, yet see nothing in the crystal, however long they stare at it. And there are crystal-seers who are not subject to hypnagogic illusions. These facts, like the analogous facts of the visualisation of arithmetical figures, analysed by Mr. Galton, show interesting varieties in the conduct of mental operations. Thus we speak of 'vision' in a poet, or novelist, and it seems likely that men of genius 'see' their fictitious characters and landscapes, while people of critical temperament, if they attempt creative work, are conscious that they do not create, but construct. On the other hand many incompetent novelists are convinced that they have 'vision,' that they see and hear their characters, but they do not, as genius does, transfer the 'vision' to their readers.|$|E
