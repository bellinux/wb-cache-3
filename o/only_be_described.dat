5|$|His {{behaviour}} {{on campaign}} can <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as perfectly honourable {{and at times}} humane, a trait which was illustrated during the French Revolutionary Wars, when he spared no effort to protect captured émigrés from {{the wrath of the}} Revolutionary radicals in the army. He also showed respect for occupied populations and never tolerated pillaging nor violence from his men. As a sign a gratitude, he was offered gifts several times but he was often seen refusing and sending them back. While on campaign in Tyrol, he was recorded to have accepted a large sum of money but he immediately distributed it to the local hospitals. Further evidence of his humanity was the care that he displayed for the lives and well-being of his men, whom he was always reluctant to sacrifice for the sake of glory.|$|E
5|$|Thought {{process in}} the MSE refers to the quantity, tempo (rate of flow) and form (or logical coherence) of thought. Thought process cannot be {{directly}} observed but can <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> by the patient, or inferred from a patient's speech. Regarding the tempo of thought, some people may experience flight of ideas, when their thoughts are so rapid that their speech seems incoherent, although a careful observer can discern a chain of poetic associations in the patient's speech. Alternatively an individual may be described as having retarded or inhibited thinking, in which thoughts seem to progress slowly with few associations. Poverty of thought is a global reduction in the quantity of thought and thought perseveration refers to a pattern where a person keeps returning to the same limited set of ideas. A pattern of interruption or disorganization of thought processes is broadly referred to as formal thought disorder, and might be described more specifically as thought blocking, fusion, loosening of associations, tangential thinking, derailment of thought, or knight's move thinking. Thought may be described as circumstantial when a patient includes {{a great deal of}} irrelevant detail and makes frequent diversions, but remains focused on the broad topic.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} or {{distance between}} two colors is a metric {{of interest in}} color science. It allows quantified examination of a notion that formerly could <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> with adjectives. Quantification of these properties is of great importance to those whose work is color critical. Common definitions {{make use of the}} Euclidean distance in a device independent color space.|$|E

25|$|Ore shoots continue, in {{essential}} parallelism, {{for several}} kilometres down plunge; furthermore in some ore trends at Widgiemooltha, ore trends and thickened basal flow channels are mirrored by low-tenor and low-grade 'flanking channels'. These flanking channels mimic the sinuous meandering ore shoots. Why extremely hot and superfluid komatiitic lavas and nickel sulfides would deposit themselves in parallel systems can <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> by Horst-Graben type faulting which is commonly seen at rift zones.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} complete {{source of}} the Tristan material in English was Sir Tristrem, a romance of some 3344 lines written circa 1300. It is preserved in the famous Auchinleck manuscript at the National Library of Scotland. The narrative largely follows the courtly tradition. As is true with many medieval English adaptations of French Arthuriana, the poem's artistic achievement can <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as average, though some critics have tried to rehabilitate it, claiming it is a parody. Its first editor, Sir Walter Scott, provided a sixty line ending to the story, which has been printed with the romance in every subsequent edition.|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} relative state formulation, Everett proposed {{that there is}} one universal wavefunction that describes the objective reality of the whole universe. He stated that when multiple subsystems interact, the total system becomes a superposition of these subsystems. This includes observers and measurement systems, which become part of one universal state (the wavefunction) that is always described via the Schrödinger Equation (or its relativistic alternative). That is, they become entangled such that one cannot define one without the other. Thus, each subsystems state can <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> relative to each subsystem with which it interacts (hence the name relative state).|$|E

25|$|Reflections can {{be divided}} into two types: {{specular}} reflection and diffuse reflection. Specular reflection describes the gloss of surfaces such as mirrors, which reflect light in a simple, predictable way. This allows for production of reflected images that can be associated with an actual (real) or extrapolated (virtual) location in space. Diffuse reflection describes non-glossy materials, such as paper or rock. The reflections from these surfaces can <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> statistically, with the exact distribution of the reflected light depending on the microscopic structure of the material. Many diffuse reflectors are described or can be approximated by Lambert's cosine law, which describes surfaces that have equal luminance when viewed from any angle. Glossy surfaces can give both specular and diffuse reflection.|$|E
25|$|A common paradox {{occurs with}} {{mathematical}} idealizations such as s which describe physical phenomena well at distant or global scales but break {{down at the}} point itself. These paradoxes are sometimes seen as relating to Zeno's paradoxes which all deal with the physical manifestations of mathematical properties of continuity, infinitesimals, and infinities often associated with space and time. For example, the electric field associated with a point charge is infinite {{at the location of}} the point charge. A consequence of this apparent paradox is that the electric field of a point-charge can <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> in a limiting sense by a carefully constructed Dirac delta function. This mathematically inelegant but physically useful concept allows for the efficient calculation of the associated physical conditions while conveniently sidestepping the philosophical issue of what actually occurs at the infinitesimally-defined point: a question that physics is as yet unable to answer. Fortunately, a consistent theory of quantum electrodynamics removes the need for infinitesimal point charges altogether.|$|E
25|$|The {{motion of}} a body can <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> {{relative}} to something elseother bodies, observers, or a set of space-time coordinates. These are called frames of reference. If the coordinates are chosen badly, the laws of motion may be more complex than necessary. For example, suppose a free body that has no external forces acting on it is at rest at some instant. In many coordinate systems, it would begin to move at the next instant, {{even though there are}} no forces on it. However, a frame of reference can always be chosen in which it remains stationary. Similarly, if space is not described uniformly or time independently, a coordinate system could describe the simple flight of a free body in space as a complicated zig-zag in its coordinate system. Indeed, an intuitive summary of inertial frames can be given as: In an inertial reference frame, the laws of mechanics take their simplest form.|$|E

25|$|According to the {{principles}} of quantum mechanics, particles do not actually have trajectories through space. Motion can <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> in terms of waves, and the momentum p of an individual particle is related to its wavelength λ by pnbsp&=nbsp&h/λ. In terms of empirical measurements, the wavelength can only be determined by observing a change in the wave between one point in space and another nearby point (mathematically, by differentiation). A wave with a shorter wavelength oscillates more rapidly, and therefore changes more rapidly between nearby points. Now suppose that we arbitrarily fix a gauge at one point in space, by saying that the energy at that location is 20% A's and 80% B's. We then measure the two waves at some other, nearby point, in order to determine their wavelengths. But there are two entirely different reasons that the waves could have changed. They could have changed because they were oscillating with a certain wavelength, or they could have changed because the gauge function changed from a 20-80 mixture to, say, 21-79. If we ignore the second possibility, the resulting theory doesn't work; strange discrepancies in momentum will show up, violating the principle of conservation of momentum. Something in the theory must be changed.|$|E

500|$|Although he {{abandoned}} internal realism, Putnam still resists {{the idea that}} any given thing or system of things can <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> in exactly one complete and correct way. He thus accepts [...] "conceptual relativity" [...] – the view {{that it may be}} a matter of choice or convention, e.g., whether mereological sums exist, or whether space-time points are individuals or mere limits. In other words, having abandoned internal realism Putnam came to accept metaphysical realism in simply the broad sense of rejecting all forms of verificationism and all talk of our 'making' the world.|$|E

500|$|Numismatist David Bullowa, in {{his early}} work on commemoratives, stated, [...] "the design of this issue is pleasing... the obverse and reverse alike are sharply defined, {{interesting}} and not crowded". Art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his work on U.S. coins and medals, wrote that the half dollar [...] "manages to combine most of the faults found in the better designs of the 1920's and 1930's." [...] After complaining about the flat design and {{the large amount of}} lettering on both sides, Vermeule critiqued, [...] "the bust of Moses Cleaveland can <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as commonplace, and the view of the Great Lakes, bisected by a large compass, is nothing short of incomprehensible." [...] Nevertheless, Vermeule suggested that Putnam did the best she could to squeeze the required text onto a half dollar, and might have done better with fewer words to place.|$|E
500|$|Issue #8 {{received}} an average score of 5.0/10 based on 20 reviews from critics on Comic Book Roundup.

This issue is anticlimactic and fails to wring much emotion from the final battle between Captain Marvel and Iron Man." [...] Justin Partridge of Newsarama gave it a 3 and said, [...] "To summarize, Civil War II #8 was basically an episode of Whose Line Is It Anyway?: Everything was made up and the stakes didn't matter... Brian Michael Bendis, who has delivered some fantastic events in his long career, limps {{across the finish line}} in this eighth issue, employing a hefty bit of deus ex 'Cosmic Power of the Universe' for what can <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as the opposite of a game changer." ...|$|E
500|$|Mark Bozon of IGN {{was highly}} {{critical}} of the game's dated graphics, found the overall gameplay very slow, and found the garbled voice work unsettling while enjoying the soundtrack. He concluded that, even as a fan of old school and abstract gameplay design, he had not enjoyed his time with the game. Lark Anderson, writing for GameSpot said there was [...] "never a dull moment" [...] due to the eccentric cast and story, and found the puzzle elements to be an entertaining challenge. His main complaints were the poor graphics, unresponsive camera system, lack of direction during navigation and the constant need for backtracking. Nintendo World Report's Nick DiMola noted the dialogue for its humor, but generally faulted most other aspects of the game; he called its graphics and sound low-quality, felt the gameplay was shallow, and found the puzzle solving segments a chore. He found it hard to recommend the title for any but dedicated fans of Suda's work. PALGN reviewer Ben Chev called the script [...] "well-written in what can <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as a typical Suda 51 style", and praised the music for its unique take on classical music. However he generally faulted the gameplay and called the graphics the worst he had seen for the DS.|$|E
