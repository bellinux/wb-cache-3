This owl is not believed to meet the IUCN Red List criterion of declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations and is therefore evaluated as being of least concern.

According to Kasper, attendance reached between 180,000 and 200,000 in the 12 days of competition. The lack of snowfall concerns prior to the championships were more than made up for with continuous snowfall though that affected spectators and competitors alike. Praise was given by Kasper both to the venue managers and Czech TV for their efforts in their successful championships. 15 different nations reached the podium at the championships noted Kasper. Kasper also state the success of the women's ski jumping event will hopefully push the International Olympic Committee to include the event for the 2014 Games in Sochi with a possible team event as well. Concerning the Nordic combined 10km mass start, Kasper stated that the event will be thoroughly analyzed as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>overall</b> season assessment as part of the discipline's current overhaul.

5|$|Because {{of their}} larval {{development}} inside the seeds which {{are protected by}} the pods, most inventorying methods are based on population of B. rufimanus adult in the field or at emergence. Adult population density can be estimated by counts on plants at field colonization. The development semiochemical attractants trapping systems for both monitoring and pest control has received particular interest in ongoing research on the weevil. Egg density can be estimated on young developing pods (>2 cm) during the oviposition period. Eggs are however small (<1mm length), green-yellowish, therefore difficult to observe. In addition, population estimate are difficult to obtain as egg laying is spread over time until 5–10 days {{after the end of}} flowering (BBCH 77). After harvest, seed quality can be observed manually at harvest and characterized according to pest damage (healthy, with no trace of damage/containing developing larvae/trace of emerged B. rufimanus adult (a hole in the seed). Alternative methods exist to sort the seeds: sorting can be done using differences in seed density due to the presence of the developing larva or of the hole left by the emerged adult, estimation of damages seeds can be done by tomography analysis. Additionally, the end of larval and pupal diapause and therefore the emergence of B. rufimanus can be induced via a solution of NaOCl and chinosol in 7 days at 30 °C, allowing the estimation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>overall</b> infestation rate can be assessed.|$|E

40|$|Background: During the curriculum, {{occupational}} therapy {{students learn to}} administer <b>a</b> range <b>of</b> assessment procedures. Interrater agreement between {{occupational therapy}} students’ ratings of group functioning {{has not yet been}} examined. Aims: To examine the interrater agreement within groups of students’ ratings using the Social Profile. Methods and Materials: The Social Profile (1) assesses the social interaction behaviors in activity groups, and thirty-five students completed the measure. Two methods <b>of</b> obtaining <b>an</b> <b>overall</b> Social Profile score were explored. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated to assess the level of agreement within groups of raters. Results: Social interaction in the study groups occurred more frequently within the basic cooperative level. There was substantial agreement within groups of raters on this level, whereas there was low to moderate agreement on the other four levels. The weighted method <b>of</b> obtaining <b>an</b> <b>overall</b> Social Profile score showed higher ICC than the simpler method. Conclusion and significance: It appears to be easier to reach high interrater agreement when considering frequently occurring behaviors in a group. The weighted method <b>of</b> obtaining <b>an</b> <b>overall</b> Social Profile score showed the best ICC results and should preferably be used in future studies where <b>an</b> <b>overall</b> measure is sought...|$|R

5|$|In 2005, Resident Evil 4 {{attempted}} {{to redefine the}} genre by emphasizing reflexes and precision aiming, broadening the gameplay with elements from the wider action genre. Its ambitions paid off, earning the title several Game of the Year awards for 2005, and the top rank on IGN's Readers' Picks Top 99 Games list. However, this also led some reviewers {{to suggest that the}} Resident Evil series had abandoned the survival horror genre, by demolishing the genre conventions that it had established. Other major survival horror series followed suit by developing their combat systems to feature more action, such as Silent Hill Homecoming, and the 2008 version of Alone in the Dark. These changes were part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>overall</b> trend among console games to shift towards visceral action gameplay. These changes in gameplay have led some purists to suggest that the genre has deteriorated into the conventions of other action games. Jim Sterling suggests that the genre lost its core gameplay when it improved the combat interface, thus shifting the gameplay away from hiding and running towards direct combat. Leigh Alexander argues that this represents a shift towards more Western horror aesthetics, which emphasize action and gore rather than the psychological experience of Japanese horror.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, {{the lineage}} and honors were {{designated}} {{to be transferred}} to the 16th Sustainment Brigade. On 16 July 2007 the group was reorganized {{as part of an effort}} to reform support groups into larger, more versatile sustainment brigades. It became the 16th Sustainment Brigade and was subsequently activated at Warner Barracks in Bamberg, Germany. The 16th Corps Support Group and the 7th Corps Support Group had been deactivated and combined to form the new formation. Their subordinate units had been moved and redesignated as well. This move made the 16th Sustainment Brigade the only brigade-sized logistics unit supporting United States Army Europe. It was put under the command of the 21st Theater Sustainment Command. The move was part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>overall</b> streamlining of the Command's logistics element, as all major logistics formations were redesigned to be modular and more efficient. The sustainment brigade not only retained all previous logistics functions and responsibilities, but also assumed additional services, like finance, medical and signal capabilities. The brigade was composed of the 16th Special Troops Battalion headquartered at Bamberg, the 391st Combat Sustainment Support Battalion at Bamberg, and the 18th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion in Grafenwoehr. It also received its shoulder sleeve insignia.|$|E

Contemporary Ottoman sources blame rivalry between Kasim and Turahan for the defeat at Kunovica, while some claim that the Serbian Despot Đurađ Branković bribed Turahan not to participate in the battle. Turahan fell from favour as a result and was banished by the Sultan to a prison in Tokat.|$|E
