40|$|The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment Facility (MSRE) {{operated}} from 1965 to 1969. The fuel was a {{molten salt}} that flowed through the reactor core {{which consisted of}} uranium tetrafluoride with molten lithium and beryllium salt used as the coolant. In 1968 the fuel was switched from {sup 235 }U to {sup 233 }U. The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment was canceled in 1969 at which time approximately 4800 kg of salt {{was transferred to the}} fuel drain tanks. There was about 36. 3 kg of uranium, 675 grams of plutonium and various fission products present in the fuel salt. The salt was allowed to solidify in the fuel drain tanks. The salt was heated on a yearly basis to recombine the fluorine gas with the uranium salt mixture. In March 1994, a gas sample was taken from the <b>off</b> <b>gas</b> <b>system</b> that indicated {sup 233 }U had migrated from the fuel drain tank system to the <b>off</b> <b>gas</b> <b>system.</b> It was found that approximately 2. 6 kg of uranium had migrated to the Auxiliary Charcoal Bed (ACB). The ACB is located in the concrete-lined charcoal bed cell which is below ground level located outside the MSRE building. Therefore, there was a concern for the potential of a nuclear criticality accident, although water would have to leak into the chamber for a criticality accident to occur. Unstable carbon/fluorine compounds were also formed when the fluorine reacted with the charcoal in the charcoal bed. The purpose of the proposed measurement system was to perform an accountability measurement to determine the fissile mass of {sup 233 }U in the primary vessel. The contents of the primary containment assembly will then be transferred to three smaller containers for long term storage. Calculations were performed using MCNP-DSP to determine the configuration of the measurement system. The information obtained from the time signatures can then be compared to the measurement data to determine the amount of {sup 233 }U present in the primary containment assembly...|$|E

40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility, DWPF, {{currently}} generates approximately 1. 4 {{million gallons}} of recycle water per year during Sludge-Only operations. DWPF has minimized condensate generation to 1. 4 million gallons by not operating the Steam Atomized Scrubbers, SASs, for the melter <b>off</b> <b>gas</b> <b>system.</b> By not operating the SASs, DWPF has reduced the total volume by approximately 800, 000 gallons of condensate per year.

The US Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Science and Technology Mixed Waste Focus Area (DOE MWFA) is sponsoring {{a comparison of}} several technologies {{that may be used}} to treat these wastes and similar wastes at BNL and other sites across the DOE complex. This report describes work conducted at BNL on the application and pilot-scale demonstration of the newly developed Sulfur Polymer Stabilization/Solidification (SPSS) process for treatment of contaminated mixed-waste soils containing high concentrations ({approximately} 5, 000 mg/L) of mercury and liquid elemental mercury. BNL's SPSS (patent pending) process chemically stabilizes the mercury to reduce vapor pressure and leachability and physically encapsulates the waste in a solid matrix to eliminate dispersion and provide long-term durability. Two 55 -gallon drums of mixed-waste soil containing high concentrations of mercury and about 62 kg of radioactive contaminated elemental mercury were successfully treated. Waste loadings of 60 wt% soil were achieved without resulting in any increase in waste volume, while elemental mercury was solidified at a waste loading of 33 wt% mercury. Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) analyses indicate the final waste form products pass current Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) allowable TCLP concentrations as well as the more stringent proposed Universal Treatment Standards.

40|$|The Savannah River Site is the US Department of Energy''s {{preferred}} {{site for}} return {{and treatment of}} all aluminum-base, spent, research and test reactor fuel assemblies. There are over 20, 000 spent fuel assemblies now stored in different countries around the world, and by 2035 many {{will be returned to}} SRS for treatment and interim storage, in preparation for disposal in a geologic repository. The early fuel assemblies for research and test reactors were made using aluminum clad plates that were fabricated from highly enriched (93 percent) uranium-aluminum alloy. Later, powder metallurgical fabrication methods were developed to produce plate fuels with higher uranium contents using either uranium aluminide, uranium oxide or uranium silicide powders mixed with aluminum. Silicide fuel elements generally are fabricated with low enriched uranium containing less than 20 percent 235 U. Following irradiation, the spent fuel assemblies are discharged from the reactor, and most assemblies have been stored in under-water pools, some since the early 1950 ''s. A number of disposition options including direct/co-disposal and melt-dilute treatment were evaluated recently. The melt-dilute technique was identified as the preferred method for treatment of aluminum-base spent fuel. The technique consists of melting the spent fuel assembly and adding depleted uranium to the melt for isotopic dilution to less than 20 percent 235 U. Aluminum is added, if necessary, to produce a predetermined alloy composition. Additionally, neutron poisons may be added to the melt where they form solid solution phases or compounds with uranium and/or aluminum. Lowering the enrichment reduces both criticality and proliferation concerns for storage. Consolidation by melting also reduces the number of storage canisters. Laboratory and small-scale process demonstration using irradiated fuel is underway. Tests of the off gas absorption system have been initiated using both surrogate and irradiated RERTR mini fuel plates.

40|$|The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) {{recently}} received a deposit sample from the Melter Primary <b>Off</b> <b>Gas</b> <b>System</b> (POG) of the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). This sample {{was composed of}} material that had been collected while the quencher was in operation January 27, 2011 through March 31, 2011. DWPF requested, through a technical assistance request, characterization of the melter off-gas deposits by x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and chemical analysis. The purpose of the Melter Off-Gas System {{is to reduce the}} amount of radioactive particles and mercury in the gases vented to the atmosphere. Gases emitted from the melter pass through the primary film cooler, quencher, Off-Gas Condensate Tank (OGCT), Steam Atomized Scrubbers (SAS), a condenser, a high efficiency mist eliminator, and a high efficiency particulate air filter, before being vented to the Process Vessel Vent System. The film coolers cool the gases leaving the melter vapor space from {approx} 750 C to {approx} 375 C, by introducing air and steam to the flow. In the next step, the quencher cools the gas to about 60 C by bringing the condensate from the OGCT in contact with the effluent (Figure 1). Most of the steam in the effluent is then condensed and the melter vapor space pressure is reduced. The purpose of the OGCT is to collect and store the condensate formed during the melter operation. Condensate from the OGCT is circulated to the SAS and atomized with steam. This atomized condensate is mixed with the off-gas to wet and join the particulate which is then removed in the cyclone. The next stage incorporates a chilled water condenser which separates the vapors and elemental mercury from the off-gas steam. Primary off-gas deposit samples from the DWPF melter have previously been analyzed. In 2003, samples from just past the film cooler, from the inlet of the quencher and inside the quencher were analyzed at SRNL. It was determined that the samples were a mixture of sludge and glass frit. The major component was Si along with Fe, Al, and other elements in the radioactive waste being processed. The deposits analyzed also contained U- 235 fission products and actinide elements. Prior to that, deposits in the off-gas system in the DWPF nonradioactive half scale melter and the one-tenth scale integrated DWPF melter system were analyzed and determined to be mixtures of alkali rich chlorides, sulfates, borates, and fluorides entrained with iron oxides, spinels and frit particles formed by vapor-phase transport and condensation. Additional work was performed in 2007 in which researchers similarly found the deposits to be a combination of sludge and frit particles...|$|E
40|$|AbstractVolume {{reduction}} of radioactive solid wastes {{is carried out}} with an aim to minimize disposal space requirement. Cellulosic combustible solid wastes like cotton, paper etc. are treated by incineration and the plastic wastes are volume reduced by baling. Compaction of plastic wastes by baling gives low volume reduction factors (3 – 5) and also the resultant waste bale may spring back to original volume after disposal. With a view to achieve higher volume reduction factors, studies were conducted at CWMF on the melt-densification of plastic wastes at 180 - 190 C. The melted plastics were characterized by TGA/DTA & IR Spectroscopy and {{found that there was}} no structural loss of the polymer compounds. The melted mass was observed to have the expected theoretical density. A melt densification unit (MDU) was set up at CWMF with a facility for melting 20 kg of the plastic waste in each batch in a 200 L MS drum. The system has a furnace with vacuum chamber where plastic waste in drum is melted and an <b>off</b> <b>gas</b> treatment <b>system</b> consisting of a scrubber followed by HEPA filter.

About 47 M 3 of β-γ and 18 M 3 of α contaminated plastic wastes were melted using the above MDU. The volume reduction factors varied from 2. 5 to 30 depending on the initial bulk density of the material. The radioactivity in the off-gases was found to be always below detectable limits.

The UDGs formed by the process concentrate towards the center of the cluster, and their globular cluster systems remain undamaged, in accordance with observational results.
