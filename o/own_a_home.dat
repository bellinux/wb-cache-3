As of 2006, married couple families, which also have the highest median income of any household type, were most likely to <b>own</b> <b>a</b> <b>home.</b> Age played a significant role as well with homeownership increasing with the age of the householder until age 65, when a slight decrease becomes visible. While only 43% of households with a householder under the age of thirty-five owned a home, 81.6% of those with a householder between the ages of 55 and 64 did.|$|E

He didn't <b>own</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> again in Montana until February 2002, when he bought half of his mother's house from the Sieben Ranch Company, the ranch started by Baucus's great-grandfather in 1897.

500|$|During the 1988 presidential campaign, Jackson met {{his future}} wife, Sandi Stevens, who was press {{secretary}} for United States Congressman Mickey Leland. After {{her first year}} at Georgetown University Law Center, the couple decided public schooling was more affordable and jointly enrolled at the University of Illinois College of Law. While still law students, they married on June 1, 1991. Jackson and Sandi now have two children, Jesse III ("Tre") and Jessica and keep two homes. They own one in the South Shore community area, which is within both the 2nd district that Congressman Jackson represents in the United States House of Representatives and within the seventh ward that his wife represents on the Chicago City Council as Alderman. The South Shore home serves as an election base for himself and candidates he has supported, for which he claims a 13–0 record in public elections.

2500|$|The name [...] "homeownership rate" [...] can be misleading. As {{defined by}} the US Census Bureau, it is the {{percentage}} of homes that are occupied by the owner. It is not the percentage of adults that own their own home. This latter percentage will be {{significantly lower than the}} homeownership rate because many households that are owner-occupied contain adult relatives (often young adults, descendents of the owner) who do not own their own home, and because single building multi-bedroom rental units can contain more than one adult, all of whom do not <b>own</b> <b>a</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Patton married Cristina Zuccatosta, an Italian artist, in 1994. The couple divided {{their time}} between San Francisco and Bologna, Italy, until their {{separation}} in 2001.

I married an Italian lady, and I {{had to get}} acquainted. Basically, it started with the language because her family and her parents didn't really speak English. I had to learn the language, so I did that. The longer you spend {{in a place like}} that, it really sucks you in. It really envelopes you and makes you feel like one of them." ...|$|E

60|$|George {{spent his}} time between the Mill and the Ram. The {{grandmother}} had received them with much grumbling but with real gladness. Meg was re-installed, and George slept at the Ram. He was extraordinarily bright, almost gay. The fact was that his new life interested and pleased him keenly. He often {{talked to me about}} Meg, how quaint and naïve she was, how she amused him and delighted him. He rejoiced in having a place of his <b>own,</b> <b>a</b> <b>home,</b> and a beautiful wife who adored him. Then the public-house was full of strangeness and interest. No hour was ever dull. If he wanted company he could go into the smoke-room, if he wanted quiet he could sit with Meg, and she was such a treat, so soft and warm, and so amusing. He was always laughing at her quaint crude notions, and at her queer little turns of speech. She talked to him with a little language, she sat on his knee and twisted his mustache, finding small unreal fault with his features for the delight of dwelling upon them. He was, he said, incredibly happy. Really he could not believe it. Meg was, ah! she was a treat. Then he would laugh, thinking how indifferent he had been about taking her. A little shadow might cross his eyes, but he would laugh again, and tell me one of his wife's funny little notions. She was quite uneducated, and such fun, he said. I looked at him as he sounded this note. I remembered his crude superiority of early days, which had angered Emily so deeply. There was in him something of the prig. I did not like his amused indulgence of his wife.|$|E
