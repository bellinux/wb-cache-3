2500|$|Kamui {{originates}} from a story Clamp's headwriter, Nanase Ohkawa, wrote {{during high}} school. Kamui {{was one of}} the lead characters fighting a losing battle in the name of [...] "justice." [...] After finishing Clamp School Detectives, Clamp decided to write a story where readers see the development of two groups which resulted in using Kamui and Fuma. While several members from the cast were created using the Osamu Tezuka's Star System technique were old designs are incorporated in new characters, no models were used to create Kamui. Clamp had several demands when illustrating Kamui since he was the series' protagonist. While he was made to <b>outstand</b> out within other characters, his hairstyle and school uniform have been referred as average by Ohkawa. Clamp's lead artist Mokona believes this was influenced by the heroic character type he was based on. As a result, Mokona comments Kamui fits the manga's story. In giving the character a name, the authors originally wanted to give him the name from another character they created in another series. However, {{as a result of the}} plot requiring him to have a meaningful name the idea was scrapped and he was given the name Kamui.|$|E

40|$|Response of {{pultruded}} Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) beam-to-column joints {{with steel}} bolted web cleats is studied through physical testing. Two joint configurations are considered with either three or two bolts per cleat leg, as per drawings in a pultruder’s Design Manual. Moment-rotation curves, failure modes and potential performance gains from semi-rigid action are determined from two batches, each having six nominally identical joints. Results show that initial joint properties for stiffness and moment can possess, at 19 to 62 %, an extremely high coefficient of variation. All joints failed by fracturing within the FRP column’s flange <b>outstands.</b> Because this failure mode {{has not been}} reported previously {{there is a need}} to establish how its existence influences joint design. As joint properties for the three- and two-bolted configurations are not significantly different, the middle (third) bolt is found to be redundant. Damage is shown to initiate within the column flange <b>outstands</b> when the mid-span deflection of a 5. 08 m span beam, subjected to a uniformly distributed load, is span/ 500. This is half the serviceability vertical deflection limit recommended in the EUROCOMP Design Code and Handbook.

Sensor environment contains interferences and background noises, which make the current distance estimation schemes difficult to the achieve high accuracy. This paper proposes an aggressive rectangle truncation (ART) localization algorithm for locating objects in a fading-signal sensor environment. The paper further presents a location verification mechanism to increase the accuracy and consistency of the estimated object location. Finally, we conduct real-world experiments to show that ART algorithm implemented on Mica 2 motes <b>outstands</b> the general triangulation algorithm...|$|R

Humanitarian organisations that require more constant delivery of goods and delicate materials such as medical supplies and food supplements have been faced with the dilemma of having to fly their materials in, due to the rains. UNHAS has only a few planes and is overstretched due to lack of funding. Many organisations are having to resort to hiring local air freight contractors, which alone is very expensive. Some organisations who cannot afford the high prices use the larger multimodal companies which offer a midway to the fast and expensive air freight, and the cheap and very slow land freight.|$|E
