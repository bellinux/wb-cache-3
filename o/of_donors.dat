As the Museum's entire purchase fund amounted to only £1.4 million at the time, the hoard had to be purchased with the assistance <b>of</b> <b>donors</b> that included the National Heritage Memorial Fund, the National Art Collections Fund (now the Art Fund), and the J.

5|$|The {{work may}} have been {{intended}} for private devotion, perhaps as a portable altarpiece for a migrant cleric. That the frames are so richly decorated with Latin inscriptions indicates that the donor, whose identity is lost, was highly educated and cultured. Because {{of a lack of}} surviving documentary evidence on commissions of 15thcentury-Northern painting, the identities <b>of</b> <b>donors</b> are often established through evidence gathered by modern art historians. In this work, damaged coats of arms on the borders of the interior wings have been identified with the Giustiniani of Genoa– an influential albergo active from 1362– who established trade links with Bruges as early as the mid-14th century.|$|E
25|$|A study {{involving}} 2408 donors (18–60 years) {{indicated that}} bone pain (primarily back and hips) {{as a result}} of filgrastim treatment is observed in 80 percent <b>of</b> <b>donors</b> by day 4 post-injection. This pain responded to acetaminophen or ibuprofen in 65 percent <b>of</b> <b>donors</b> and was characterized as mild to moderate in 80 percent <b>of</b> <b>donors</b> and severe in 10 percent. Bone pain receded post-donation to 26 percent of patients 2 days post-donation, 6 percent of patients one week post-donation, and <2 percent 1 year post-donation. Donation is not recommended for those with a history of back pain. Other symptoms observed in more than 40 percent <b>of</b> <b>donors</b> include myalgia, headache, fatigue, and insomnia.

40|$|AbstractDelayed {{immunologic}} recovery after allogeneic {{bone marrow}} transplantation (BMT) represents {{a major cause of}} morbidity and mortality that limits the overall success of the transplantation procedure. Recent clinical data suggest that a subset <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> dendritic cells may inhibit the graft-versus-tumor activity <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> T cells. We studied the immunoregulatory activity <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> dendritic cells in allogeneic BMT between major histocompatibility complex-disparate strains of mice. Bone marrow grafts enriched or depleted of CD 11 b− and CD 11 b+ dendritic cell subsets by immunomagnetic cell sorting were combined with small numbers of congenic splenic T cells. Recipients of CD 11 b-depleted bone marrow had significant posttransplantation expansion <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> spleen-derived CD 4 + memory T cells compared with recipients of unmanipulated bone marrow. CD 11 b depletion enhanced the antitumor activity <b>of</b> the splenic <b>donor</b> T cells without producing significant graft-versus-host disease and resulted in long-term survival after a supralethal dose of T-cell leukemia administered after BMT. Expansion <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> spleen-derived T cells was proportional to the number of CD 11 b− dendritic cells in the bone marrow graft and was associated with increased levels of serum interferon-γ. Thus, manipulating the content <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> antigen-presenting cells in allogeneic BMT is a novel strategy to activate donor memory T cells and enhance allogeneic graft-versus-leukemia effects with minimal graft-versus-host disease...|$|R

25|$|It is {{also found}} that the rate of trophallactic feeding depends on the number of ants per nest, and the quality of food available. When the number <b>of</b> <b>donors</b> is kept constant, but the number of total {{individuals}} in increased, more individuals test positive for the food marker. This indicates that more individuals are eating, but the amount they eat is less. If the number <b>of</b> <b>donors</b> was doubled, {{and the size of the}} overall population increased, the number of individuals receiving food more than doubled, again indicating that the number of individuals fed increased, but that the per capita amount of food consumed decreased. The ants prefer sugar and protein food sources over lipids, and this preference did not change seasonally. When specific sugar sources were studied the ants preferred sucrose over other sugars, such as fructose and glucose.|$|E

40|$|Background. : We {{and others}} have {{demonstrated}} that a low level <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> cell chimerism was present for years after transplantation in tissues and peripheral blood of heart and lung recipients; it was associated, in the latter, with a lower incidence of chronic rejection. To augment this phenomenon, we initiated a trial combining simultaneous infusion <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> bone marrow with heart or lung allotransplantation. Methods. : Between September 1993 and January 1995, 15 nonconditioned patients received either heart (n = 10) or lung (n = 5) allografts concurrently with an infusion <b>of</b> unmodified <b>donor</b> bone marrow (3. 0 × 10 8 cells/kg), and were maintained on an immunosuppressive regimen consisting of tacrolimus and steroids. Results. : There was no complication associated with the infusion <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> bone marrow. Chimerism was detectable in 73 % of bone marrow-augmented patients {{up to the last}} sample tested. Of the 5 control recipients who did not receive bone marrow infusion, only 1 had detectable chimerism by flow on postoperative day 15, which dwindled to an undetectable level by postoperative day 36. None of the patients had evidence of donor-specific immune modulation by mixed lymphocyte reaction. Conclusions. : The combined infusion <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> bone marrow and heart or lung transplantation, without preconditioning of the recipient, is safe and is associated with an augmentation <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> cell chimerism. © 1995 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons...|$|R
