5|$|He is {{critical}} of greed for gold, such as the absurdity of using the metal for coins in the early Republic. He gives examples of the way rulers proclaimed their prowess by exhibiting gold looted from their campaigns, such as that by Claudius after conquering Britain, and tells the stories of Midas and Croesus. He discusses why gold is unique in its malleability and ductility, far greater than any other metal. The examples given are its ability to be beaten into fine foil with just one ounce, producing 750 leaves four inches square. Fine gold wire can be woven into cloth, although imperial clothes usually combined it with natural fibres like wool. He <b>once</b> <b>saw</b> Agrippina the Younger, wife of Claudius, at a public show on the Fucine Lake involving a naval battle, wearing a military cloak made of gold. He rejects Herodotus's claims of Indian gold obtained by ants or dug up by griffins in Scythia.|$|E
5|$|I {{had settled}} {{an affair with}} five gentlemen of that country who were each of them to raise a {{regiment}} of dragoons well mounted and well armed which I knew they could easily do for the men had horses and homes of their own, and were, to say the truth most of them, the persons who some time since robbed the late Bishop of Winchester's Park, and have increased in their number ever since. They go {{by the name of}} the Waltham Blacks (tho few of them live there) which is a most loyal little town...I <b>once</b> <b>saw</b> two hundred and upwards of these Blacks in a body within half a mile of my house. They had been running brandy. There was 24 customs officers following them who they abused heartily and carried off their cargo. I am told there is no less than a thousand of them and indeed I believe they have now taken loyalty into their heads, and will I hope prove very useful.|$|E

25|$|In July 1962, Oswald {{was hired}} by the Leslie Welding Company in Dallas; he disliked the work and quit after three months. On October 12, he started working for the graphic-arts firm of Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall as a photoprint trainee. A fellow {{employee}} at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall testified that Oswald's rudeness at his new job was such that fights threatened to break out, and that he <b>once</b> <b>saw</b> Oswald reading a Russian-language publication. Oswald was fired almost 6 months later, on the first week of April 1963.|$|E
25|$|In his {{professional}} career, Gonzales won the United States Professional Championship eight times, the Wembley professional title in London four times, and the Tournament of Champions three times, plus beating, in head-to-head pro tours, {{all of the}} best amateurs who turned pro, which included every Wimbledon champion for 10 years in a row. During this time Gonzales {{was known for his}} fiery will to win, his cannonball serve, and his all-conquering net game, a combination so potent that the rules on the professional tour were briefly changed to prohibit him from advancing to the net immediately after serving. Under the new rules, the returned serve had to bounce before the server could make his own first shot, thereby keeping Gonzales from playing his usual serve-and-volley game. He won even so, and the rules were changed back. So great was his ability to raise his game to the highest possible level, particularly in the fifth set of long matches, Allen Fox has said that he never <b>once</b> <b>saw</b> Gonzales lose service when serving for the set or the match.|$|E
25|$|According {{to federal}} {{investigator}} Rosario G. Sandoval Medina, former high-ranking Gulf Cartel boss Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez confirmed that Cárdenas Vela {{had ordered the}} mass kidnapping. Cárdenas Vela became the regional boss of the Gulf Cartel in Matamoros in March 2011, four {{months prior to the}} mass kidnapping. He was eventually arrested in Texas in October 2011, and the Subprocuraduría Especializada en Investigación de Delincuencia Organizada (SEIDO) federal agency under the directorship of José Cuitláhuac Salinas Martínez promised to form an agreement with U.S. law enforcement to interrogate him about the case. The family, however, expressed their disappointment with both Mexican and U.S. authorities for failing to cooperate. In February 2013, one of the Cázares family members confirmed to the press that legal procedure to interrogate Cárdenas Vela was unfruitful. One of the family nephews stated that he <b>once</b> <b>saw</b> the vehicles the kidnappers were driving (which were stolen from the Cázares) in Matamoros. He reportedly called the police to let them know, but they were unable to locate the vehicle or the kidnappers.|$|E

25|$|The role of Vikki, Jake's second wife, had {{interest}} {{across the}} board, {{but it was}} Pesci who suggested actress Cathy Moriarty from a picture he <b>once</b> <b>saw</b> at a New Jersey disco. Both De Niro and Scorsese believed that Moriarty could portray the role after meeting with her on several occasions and noticing her husky voice and physical maturity. The duo had {{to prove to the}} Screen Actors Guild that she was right for the role when Cis Corman showed 10 comparing pictures of both Moriarty and the real Vikki LaMotta for proof she had a resemblance. Moriarty was then asked to take a screen test which she managed—partly aided with some improvised lines from De Niro—after some confusion wondering why the crew were filming her take. Joe Pesci also persuaded his former show-biz pal and co-star in The Death Collector, Frank Vincent, to try for the role of Salvy Batts. Following a successful audition and screen test, Vincent received the call to say he had received the part. Charles Scorsese, the director's father, made his film debut as Tommy Como's cousin, Charlie.|$|E

500|$|Many historians regard Offa as {{the most}} {{powerful}} Anglo-Saxon king before Alfred the Great. His dominance never extended to Northumbria, though he gave his daughter Ælfflæd in marriage to the Northumbrian king Æthelred I in 792. Historians <b>once</b> <b>saw</b> his reign as part of a process leading to a unified England, but this is no longer the majority view. In the words of a recent historian: [...] "Offa was driven by a lust for power, not a vision of English unity; and what he left was a reputation, not a legacy." [...] Offa died in 796; his son, Ecgfrith, succeeded him, but reigned for less than five months before Coenwulf of Mercia became king.|$|E

Robert Kirby described a typical visit: [...] "He would arrive and not talk, sit down, listen to music, have a smoke, have a drink, sleep there the night, and two or three days later he wasn't there, he'd be gone. And three months later he'd be back." [...] Nick's supervision partner at Cambridge, John Venning, <b>once</b> <b>saw</b> him on a tube train in London and felt he was seriously clinically depressed.

500|$|In August 1965, the Beatles and Epstein visited Elvis Presley at {{his house}} in Perugia Way in Los Angeles, where Elvis' manager, Colonel Tom Parker, set up a {{roulette}} wheel and several packs of playing cards. Epstein immediately asked to play, as he {{was known for his}} love of gambling. McCartney frequently visited gambling clubs in London, such as Curzon House, Epstein's favourite club, where he often ran into Epstein. He <b>once</b> <b>saw</b> Epstein put a Dunhill lighter worth £100 (...) on the table, then lose it during a game of cards. Epstein often lost thousands of pounds by playing baccarat or chemin de fer, the original version of baccarat when it was introduced to France, but would stay at Curzon House the whole evening, eating an expensive meal and drinking fine wines. The club never presented Epstein with a bill, as they knew he lost so much in the casino.|$|E
500|$|... "Mmm Papi" [...] is a latin pop {{song that}} lasts {{for three minutes}} and twenty-two seconds. The song has dancehall {{elements}} and a 1960s go-go vibe, and incorporates into its melody handclaps and a rock guitar. Anna Dimond of TV Guide perceived influences of Madonna's [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] (1987) in the song, and called it an [...] "ode to the tropical life (and perhaps its masculine fruits)". It {{has been suggested that}} its lyrics deal with either her father Jamie Spears or paparazzi [...] However, this was denied by Morier, who said [...] "the song is definitely not about Adnan and in the whole time I worked with [...] last spring and summer I never <b>once</b> <b>saw</b> that guy." [...] Morier described [...] "Mmm Papi" [...] as a fun upbeat song, while saying the title [...] "came out of [...] Mmm Papa Luv U." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Dylan Kickham described the song as a [...] "bizarre attempt at combining Latin pop with ’60s psychedelic soul".|$|E
500|$|The {{idea behind}} [...] "Pavor Nocturnus" [...] came before {{production}} {{started on the}} second season.

Kindler <b>once</b> <b>saw</b> I Am Legend, and practically wanted to [...] "rip it off" [...] with a Sanctuary-esque story behind it. It was written to be more about Magnus and Zimmerman than the [...] "zombies;" [...] by doing the opposite—the episode being more about the zombies and Magnus spending most of the episode finding a cure—it would not be as interesting. Kindler ran out of time to allow the episode to move at the correct pace, and asked James Thorpe to co-write it with him; out of the five acts, Thorpe wrote the first two acts, while Kindler wrote the remaining three. Kindler liked Thorpe's contribution towards the episode for including much of the imagination and ideas towards it.|$|E
