After the Gallipoli Campaign ended with the withdrawal of Allied forces in January 1916, Canopus patrolled the eastern Mediterranean, but saw no further action. She was removed from service in April 1916 and was converted into a barracks ship in early 1918. After the war, the ship was broken up in 1920.|$|E

5|$|In March 2008, Kirchner {{introduced}} a new sliding-scale taxation system for agricultural exports, so that rates fluctuated with international prices. This would effectively raise levies on soybean exports from 35% to 44% {{at the time of}} the announcement. This new taxation scheme, proposed by Minister Mart√≠n Lousteau, led to a nationwide lockout by farming associations, with the aim <b>of</b> <b>forcing</b> the government to back down on new tax system. They were joined on 25 March by thousands of pot-banging demonstrators massed around the Buenos Aires Obelisk and the presidential palace. These demonstrations were followed by others at locations across the country that included road blockades and food shortages.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{introduction}} of the Bagnall locomotives and the traffic generated by the works at Waddesdon Manor had boosted the route's fortunes, it remained in serious financial difficulty. The only connection with the national railway network was by way of the turntable at Quainton Road. The 3rd Duke of Buckingham chaired the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway but its management regarded the Tramway as a nuisance. In the 1870s it charged disproportionately high fees for through traffic between the Tramway and the main line with the intention <b>of</b> <b>forcing</b> the Tramway out of business. Relations deteriorated between Jones and J.G. Rowe, Secretary and Traffic Manager of the A The A's trains at Quainton Road would miss connections with the Tramway, causing milk shipped to Quainton to become unsellable, to the extent that Jones began unloading milk at Waddesdon and shipping it to Aylesbury by road. Although Jones asked the Duke to intervene relations remained poor; in 1888 Rowe blocked the telegraph along the Tramway, and in one meeting Jones and Rowe threatened violence.|$|E

5|$|In the 1876 presidential election, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio {{defeated}} Democrat Samuel J.

Payne was named to the committee at Tilden's request, but the results went against the Democrats as Hayes was declared the winner of the disputed votes. After the Commissions result, Payne joined many Democrats in attempting to delay the House proceedings in hopes <b>of</b> <b>forcing</b> a more favorable result, but was outvoted by Republicans and the Democrats who sided with Speaker Samuel J.

5|$|Levels in {{the game}} include a mixture of platforming, {{swimming}} and on-rails levels.

The level design is more diverse compared to its predecessors, which includes more complex puzzles and obstacles. Every level has an enemy called a Koin; each of these enemies bears the DK Coin of their respective level, holding it as a shield. As these enemies always face towards the player, they must be defeated by throwing a steel barrel over them so it bounces off a wall behind {{them in order to}} strike them from behind. The game overworld is also more complex, allowing players to explore between each area instead <b>of</b> <b>forcing</b> them along a linear path.

5|$|Much {{like the}} {{previous}} year, {{one-third of the}} reigning Mexican National Trios Champions was unable to further help defend the title. This year, CMLL resolved the situation differently, but still managed to organize in a tournament. The champions, Mascara Dorada, Stuka Jr., and Metro, successfully defended their championship on November 15, 2010, in Arena Puebla. Dorada suffered an ankle injury {{during the course of}} the match. Citing both the injury (which would keep him out a month) and, more so, the demands of his other three championships, Mascara Dorada vacated his share of the titles three days later. CMLL broke with the precedent <b>of</b> <b>forcing</b> the entire team to vacate the titles and instead declared a web poll would determine a replacement for Mascara Dorada. Voting was held for over two weeks on CMLL.com.|$|E

5|$|Surrey {{visited the}} County Ground, Taunton {{a few days}} later for the counties' second meeting of the season. In a repeat of their {{previous}} fixtures, Surrey won the toss and chose to bat. Bastard, who had not played in their earlier clash, opened the bowling for Somerset alongside John Challen. Bastard, presumably due to the weakness {{of the rest of the}} county's attack, bowled 50 overs, but he could not repeat the successes he had achieved against Hampshire, toiling to take two for 99. All of Somerset's six bowlers in that innings claimed a wicket as Surrey were bowled out for 292. In reply, Radcliffe occupied the crease as the batsmen at the other end came and went, scoring exactly half of Somerset's 164. Roe, Sainsbury and Hewett all reached double figures, but four Somerset batsmen were dismissed for ducks. Requested to follow on, Somerset fared less well in their second innings: Roe reached 43, but no other batsman passed 20, and Somerset were all out for 123, five runs short <b>of</b> <b>forcing</b> Surrey to bat again.|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} substantive {{framework of}} the use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> in international law has been challenged by recent developments involving non-state actors. This dissertation considers {{the legality of the}} use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> against non-state actors, specifically terrorists, where the terrorist acts are not attributable to the territorial state. The United States' air campaign against the Islamic State in Syria is examined to determine whether the United States' conduct constitutes a lawful exercise of the use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> in international law. The substantive {{framework of the}} use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> in international law is first analysed, which includes an explanation of the scope of the prohibition of the use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> in international law and the various exceptions to this prohibition. This is followed by a description of the focus of this paper, terrorism and counterterrorism, and of the development of the use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> against terrorists in international law. The current status of the use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> against terrorists in international law is elucidated. The United States' use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> against the Islamic State in Syria is contextualised through the provision of a brief history of the conflict in Syria and the emergence of the Islamic State as a terrorist threat. Possible legal justifications regarding United States' use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> in Syria are examined to conclude whether the air strikes are lawful in terms of international law on the use <b>of</b> <b>force.</b> It is hoped that this paper will contribute to the growing debate about the legality of the use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> against terrorists and eventually, to a clearer framework on the use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> in international law...|$|R

5|$|Thailand, which {{shared an}} 800-kilometer (500-mile) border with Kampuchea and has {{historically}} feared Vietnam's expansionism, demanded that Vietnam immediately remove its troops from Kampuchea so its people could elect a government free from foreign intervention. Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore showed {{their support for}} Thailand's position. Furthermore, ASEAN viewed Vietnam‚Äôs invasion and subsequent occupation of Kampuchea, which received strong Soviet support, as an intolerable threat to the region‚Äôs security and stability. That view was shared by China, which {{went as far as}} accusing Vietnam <b>of</b> <b>forcing</b> Kampuchea into an Indochinese federation to serve as an outpost of Soviet global hegemony. The United States, which never maintained any form of diplomatic ties with the Khmer Rouge‚Äôs Democratic Kampuchea, showed strong support for the membership of their former enemy in the UN General Assembly, and echoed ASEAN's call for an immediate withdrawal of Vietnamese military forces from Kampuchea.|$|E
5|$|The {{race was}} a story of pit strategy, as the only passing on the circuit was of lapped traffic. Albers was the only car to run a three pit stop race, as all other drivers chose to stop only twice. The only lead changes came on lap 26, as Schumacher's 32-second stop gave Barrichello the lead, and on lap 51, as Schumacher turned in the quickest pit stop at 23.615 seconds, giving him enough time to exit pit lane {{at the same time}} as Barrichello, with the result <b>of</b> <b>forcing</b> Barrichello into the grass of Turn One. After this incident, which was not {{investigated}} by race officials, both Ferrari drivers were reminded over their radios not to crash out of the race, and they both settled into a slower pace, comfortably ahead of the rest of the field. All four of the drivers for Jordan and Minardi scored their first points in Formula One at this race. Karthikeyan's points were the first for an Indian driver in Formula One. This was also the final race at which the Minardi team tallied points.|$|E
5|$|The {{siege of}} Medina began in January 627 and lasted for 27 days. Since sieges were {{uncommon}} in Arabian warfare, the arriving confederates were unprepared {{to deal with}} the trenches dug by the Muslims. The Confederates tried to attack with horsemen in hopes <b>of</b> <b>forcing</b> a passage, but the Medinans were rigidly entrenched, preventing such a crossing. Both of the armies gathered {{on either side of the}} trench and spent two or three weeks exchanging insults in prose and verse, backed up with arrows fired from a comfortable distance. According to Rodinson, there were three dead among the attackers and five among the defenders. On the other hand, the harvest had been gathered and the besiegers had some trouble finding food for their horses, which proved of no use to them in the attack.|$|E

40|$|The United Nations Charter's use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> {{paradigm}} prohibits all uses <b>of</b> <b>force</b> {{by states}} except {{in respect of}} self-defence or when authorised by the Security Council. However, in 1999, NATO, without express authorisation from the Security Council, undertook non-defensive military action against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, {{in response to the}} ongoing crisis in Kosovo. Then, in March 2003, the United States led a coalition of states in a war against Iraq. This military action was also not expressly authorised by the Security Council. Both of these uses <b>of</b> <b>force</b> are ~neral 1 y considered to constitute primafacie breaches of the Charter's use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> paradigm. These breaches of the Charter have led some observers to claim that the [...] :f Charter's use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> paradigm is now 'dead'. It is argued that the invasion of Iraq by the United States-led coalition represents a fmal assault on the Charter's use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> rules. These spectacular breaches of the Charter demonstrate that states no longer consider the Charter's use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> paradigm to be authoritative and controlling. Thereby, the Charter's use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> paradigm is no longer valid. Through the prism ofKosovo and Iraq, this thesis examines the question of :he impact of breaches of the Charter's use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> paradigm upon its :ontinued validity. It is posited that although the Charter's use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> rules lave been breached, these breaches do not mean that the Charter's use of orce paradigm is repudiated by states and thereby no longer valid.
