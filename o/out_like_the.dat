5|$|Nallur, {{the capital}} was built with four entrances with gates. There were two main roadways and four temples {{at the four}} gateways. The rebuilt temples that exist now do not match their {{original}} locations which instead are occupied by churches erected by the Portuguese. The {{center of the city}} was Muthirai Santhai (market place) and was surrounded by a square fortification around it. There were courtly buildings for the Kings, Brahmin priests, soldiers and other service providers. The old Nallur Kandaswamy temple functioned as a defensive fort with high walls. In general, the city was laid <b>out</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> traditional temple town according to Hindu traditions.|$|E
5|$|On {{the east}} coast are Goat Cave and Clamshell Cave. The latter is 10m high, about 6m wide at the entrance, and some 45m long, and {{on one side of}} it the ridges of basalt stand <b>out</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> ribs of a ship. Near this cave is the {{pyramidal}} rock islet of Am Buachaille ('The Herdsman'), a pile of basalt columns seen fully only at low tide. Other outlying rocks include Eilean Dubh to the north-west and a series of skerries stretching for half a kilometre to the south-west. On the southwest shore are Boat Cave and Mackinnon's Cave (named after a 15th-century abbot of Iona), which has a tunnel connecting it to Cormorant Cave. These caves lie to the south-west and can be accessed from the bay of Port an Fhasgaidh at low tide. In 1945 a mine exploded near Boat Cave, causing damage to the cliff face which is still visible. Mackinnon's Cave is 107 metres long.|$|E
5|$|X. bracteatum {{had been}} {{introduced}} to cultivation in England by 1791. German horticulturist Herren Ebritsch obtained material and developed it at his nursery in Arnstadt near Erfurt in Germany. He bred and sold cultivars of many colours from bronze to white to purple, which spread across Europe in the 1850s. The bracts of these early forms tended to remain cupped around the flower head rather than flatten <b>out</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> native Australian forms. These were also annual rather than perennial forms. Many were given cultivar names such as 'atrococcineum' (dark scarlet flower heads), 'atrosanguineum' (dark blood-red flower heads), 'aureum' (golden yellow flower heads), 'bicolor' (red-tipped yellow flower heads), 'compositum' (large multicoloured flower heads), 'macranthum' (large rose-edged white flower heads), and 'monstrosum' (flower heads with many bracts), although today they are generally sold in mixed seed for growing as annuals. Some coloured forms of South African Helichrysum {{are thought to have}} been introduced to the breeding program, which resulted in the huge array of colours. X. bracteatum was one of several species that became popular with European royalty and nobility from the early 19th century, yet were little noticed in Australia until the 1860s, when they became more prominent in Australian gardens.|$|E

Tancredi, however, insists that he is fighting for a very good reason. Later, as the Prince gets dressed, he realizes the practicality of Tancredi's words.

500|$|Wright's main {{influence}} was jazz, particularly Miles Davis and John Coltrane. He never considered himself a typical songwriter, preferring to create whole albums of {{music with a}} theme, later saying [...] "if the words came <b>out</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> music, and we didn't have anything else to do, then quite a few would be written". A number of compositions credited to Wright came out of improvisation and randomly trying ideas, {{some of which were}} picked up enthusiastically by his band mates. Wright later said [...] "I just play and don't really think about what I'm doing, I just let it happen". Of all the Pink Floyd members, Wright was the most reserved, sitting down behind the keyboards and concentrating on the music.|$|E
500|$|... "Bye Bye Baby" [...] is a hip hop {{and dance}} song which {{begins with the}} declaration, [...] "This is not a love song". A low bass is heard against a high-pitched 1960s {{keyboard}} sound. Madonna's vocals were attenuated to sound much thinner with more treble. Guitar sounds are spread throughout occasionally with shouting voices being heard in the background. The song ends {{with the sound of}} an explosion. Madonna's filtered voice sounds like an answering machine; the final line, [...] "You fucked it up", is bleeped <b>out</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> machine's end-of-message tone. According to the sheet music published by Alfred Publishing Inc., the song is set in the time signature of common time with a fast tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of F minor, with Madonna's voice in a high register, spanning between F3 to A4. The song has a basic sequence of G–B–G–D–G–Dm as its chord progression.|$|E

[...] The Cincinnati Enquirer gave the game four stars out of five and said that [...] "What it lacks in originality it more than makes up for with its fun and easy-to-pick-up game play that will appeal to fans of the long-running comedy." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave it a B and said, [...] "If some of the missions seem repetitive, others stand <b>out,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> one that has you confiscating copies of a particularly violent videogame (wink, wink) corrupting Springfield's youth."

Udell again protested to no avail, recording in his journal that night: [...] "Had there been a road that I could have traveled without a guide, I should have gone on and risked the consequences." [...] Having trekked [...] without clean water, the party's stock had grown extremely thirsty. The supply at Cataract Canyon was limited, and it contained what Udell called [...] "wigglers"; however, they {{had no choice but to}} drink from, and allow their animals to drink from, the less than ideal source. By August 9, the Rose–Baley Party had begun to lose confidence in Savedra's ability to find water, and had been forced to do their own scouting for the precious resource. They had taken to building casks out of pine in hopes that they could gather enough in containers to last them until the next acceptable supply. Udell wrote, [...] "Our water still holds <b>out...</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> widow's cruse of oil, and tastes more pleasant, having been stirred up so often for us." ...|$|E

A spacious projected Delancey Square—intended to cover the area within today's Eldridge, Essex, Hester and Broome Streets—was eliminated when the loyalist Delancey family's property was confiscated after the American Revolution.

2500|$|Among Gwynn's primary {{strengths}} was {{his patience}} in allowing {{the ball to}} reach the strike zone before starting his swing. His bats were as small as anyone used during his career, and their lightness allowed him to wait longer before committing to his swing; he was rarely fooled by a pitch. Growing up, he was not overparticular about his baseball bats, using anything that was available. Gwynn started with a 34-inch, 32-ounce aluminum bat in college. As a junior, he had to replace it as after it got dented, and came across a 32-inch, 31-ounce model that was more to his liking. At his first minor league stop at Walla Walla, the shortest bat they had was 34 inches. To Gwynn's surprise, he uncharacteristically started hitting home runs. On their first road trip to Eugene, Oregon, he acquired a couple of 32-inch bats that he could better handle. In the first 12 years of his MLB career, Gwynn used a 32½-inch, 31-ounce bat. In his final eight years, he employed a 33-inch, 30½-ounce bat. Gwynn wanted his wooden bats light like his aluminum ones in college. Instead of having the barrel of his bats shaved, as many batters do, he had them [...] "cupped", {{with the end of}} the barrel hollowed <b>out</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> bottom of a wine bottle. His small hands required that he use thin-handled bats. His bat control made him a good hit-and-run batter, although some former teammates complained he would swing for a hit even when a player was trying to steal, depriving his teammate of a stolen base.|$|E
