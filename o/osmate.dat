We {{find that the}} alkali-metal atoms (rattlers) couple to each other more strongly than they couple to the cage atoms, and that, at 300 K, this coupling is strongest for Cs. We show that this coupling controls the dominant dynamics in the rattling of these atoms. We provide preliminary evidence that the rattlers couple to each other primarily through the T 2 g mode whereas their coupling to the cage modes occurs through the T 1 u mode. Rattler coupling through the T 2 g mode provides insight into the trend in spectral broadening from Cs to K. The spectral broadening is inversely proportional {{to the strength of}} the dynamical correlations on the alkali-metal sublattice which in turn depend on the atomic size of the rattler, decreasing from Cs to K. Thus, the broadest spectrum exhibited by the K is partly a consequence of the small size of this rattler which permits a greater range of motions involving combinations of both correlated and anti-correlated dynamics. We emphasize that the identification of the somewhat distinct roles of the T 1 u and T 2 g modes in rattler coupling reported in this work is a significant step towards a complete fundamental mechanism of rattler dynamical coupling in these <b>osmates.</b> We believe that such a mechanism will have profound implications for a broad class of cage compounds, including clathrates and skutterudites...|$|R

Combining inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements and ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we use a new approach to investigate rattling in the Al-doped defect pyrochlore tungstates: AAl 0. 33 W 1. 67 O 6 (A = K, Rb, Cs). We find that although all the alkali metals rattle, the rattling of the K atoms is unique, not only among the tungstates but also among the analogous defect <b>osmates,</b> KOs 2 O 6 and RbOs 2 O 6. Detailed analysis of the MD trajectories reveals that two unique features set the K dynamics apart from the rest, namely, (1) quasi one-dimensional local diffusion within a cage, and (2) vibration at a range of frequencies. The local diffusion is driven by strongly anharmonic local potentials around the K atoms exhibiting a double-well structure in the direction of maximum displacement, which is also the direction of local diffusion. On the other hand, vibration at a range of frequencies is a consequence of the strong anisotropy in the local potentials around the K atoms as revealed by directional magnitude spectra. We present evidence to show that it is the smaller size rather than the smaller mass of the K rattler which leads to the unusual dynamics. Finally, we suggest that the occurrence of local diffusion and vibration at a range of frequencies in the dynamics of a single rattler, as found here for the K atoms, may open new possibilities for phonon engineering in thermoelectric materials. © 2014, IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R

40|$|We {{have used}} ab initio {{molecular}} dynamics simulations validated against inelastic neutron scattering data to study alkali-metal dynamics in the ?-pyrochlore <b>osmates</b> AOs 2 O 6 (A=K, Rb, Cs) at 300 ?K to {{gain insight into}} the microscopic nature of rattling dynamics in these materials. Our results provide new evidence at the microscopic level for rattling dynamics: (1) ?the elemental magnitude spectra calculated from the MD show a striking dominance by the alkali metals at low energies indicating weak coupling to the cage, (2) the atomic root-mean-square displacements for the alkali metals are significantly larger than for the other atoms, e. g., 25 % and 150 % larger than O and Os, respectively, in KOs 2 O 6, and (3) motions of the alkali metals are weakly correlated to the dynamics in their immediate environment, e. g. ?K in KOs 2 O 6 is 6 times less sensitive to its local environment than Os, indicating weak bonding of the K. There is broadening of the elemental spectra of the alkali metals from Cs to K corresponding to a similar broadening of the local potential around these atoms as determined from potential of mean-force calculations. This feature of the spectra is partly explained by the well-known increase in the relative cage volume with decreasing atomic size of the alkali metal. We find that for the smallest rattler in this series (K) the larger relative cage volume allows this atom freedom to explore a large space inside the cage leading to vibration at {{a broader range of}} frequencies, hence a broader spectrum. Thus, since K is considered the best rattler in this series, these findings suggest that a significant feature of a good rattler is the ability to vibrate at several different but closely spaced frequencies. © 2013, IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{interest}} in TM oxides with 5 d valence electrons has grown immensely {{due to the}} realization of novel spin-orbit coupled ground states. In these compounds, e. g., iridates and <b>osmates,</b> the intriguing situation arises where the spin-orbit and electron-electron interactions meet on the same energy scale. This {{has created a new}} window of interest in these compounds since the interplay of crystal field effects, local multiplet physics, spin-orbit couplings, and intersite hopping can offer novel types of correlated ground states and excitations. In 5 d 5 iridates, a spin-orbit entangled j = 1 / 2 Mott insulating state has been realized recently. A remarkable feature of such a ground state is that it gives rise to anisotropic magnetic interactions. The 2 D honeycomb-lattice 213 iridium oxides, A 2 IrO 3 (A=Li,Na), have been put forward to host highly anisotropic bond-dependent spin-spin interactions that resemble the Kitaev spin model, which supports various types of topological phases relevant in quantum computing. The 2 D square-lattice 214 iridates Sr 2 IrO 4 and Ba 2 IrO 4 are, on the other hand, appealing because of their perceived structural and magnetic simi- larity to La 2 CuO 4, the mother compound of the cuprate high-Tc superconductors. This has promoted the latter iridium oxide compounds as novel platforms for the search of high-Tc superconductivity. To put such considerations on a firm footing, it is essential to quantify the different coupling strengths and energy scales, as they for instance appear in effective Hamiltonian descriptions of these correlated systems. Moreover, it is important to correctly describe their effects. In this thesis, the electronic structure and magnetic properties of 5 d 5 (mainly 214 and 213) iridates are studied using wave-function-based quantum chemistry methods. These methods are fully ab initio and are capable of accurately treating the electron-electron interactions without using any ad hoc parameters. The spin-orbit entangled j = 1 / 2 ground state in 214, 213 and other lower symmetry Sr 3 CuIrO 6 and Na 4 Ir 3 O 8 iridates is first analyzed in detail, by studying the local electronic structure of the 5 d 5 Ir 4 + ion. We establish that the longer-range crystal anisotropy, i. e., low-symmetry fields related to ionic sites beyond the nearest neighbor oxygen cage, strongly influence the energies of Ir d levels. The ground state in all the compounds studied is j = 1 / 2 like with admixture from j ≃ 3 / 2 states ranging from 1 – 15 %. Further, the average j ≃ 1 / 2 → j ≃ 3 / 2 excitation energy we find is around 0. 6 eV. The NN magnetic exchange interactions we computed for 214 iridates are predominantly isotropic Heisenberg-like with J ~ 60 meV, 3 – 4 times smaller than found in isostructural copper oxides. However, the anisotropic interactions are an order of magnitude larger than those in cuprates. Our estimates are in excellent agreement with those extracted from experiments, e. g., resonant inelastic x-ray scattering measurements. For the 213 honeycomb-lattice Na 2 IrO 3 our calculations show that the relevant spin Hamiltonian contains further anisotropic terms beyond the Kitaev-Heisenberg model. Nevertheless, we predict that the largest energy scale is the Kitaev interaction, 10 to 20 meV, while the Heisenberg superexchange and off-diagonal symmetric anisotropic couplings are significantly weaker. In the sister compound Li 2 IrO 3, we find that the structural inequivalence between the two types of Ir-Ir links has a striking influence on the effective spin Hamiltonian, leading in particular to two very different NN superexchange pathways, one weakly AF (~ 1 meV) and another strongly FM (− 19 meV). The latter gives rise to rigid spin- 1 triplets on a triangular lattice...|$|R

A thin film of LaNiO3 grown on the (111) crystal face of lanthanum aluminate, (LaAlO3) was interpreted to be both conductor and a polar material at room temperature.
