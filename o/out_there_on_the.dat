500|$|Attention {{focused on}} the battle between Ralf Schumacher and Michael Schumacher during the race. Michael Schumacher blamed his brother for instigating the move and did not {{understand}} why he was upset over the incident. Ralf Schumacher did not comment and stated that he would watch a video of the incident before he would say anything. Their father, Rolf talked to the pair {{in an effort to}} get them reconciled. One week after the race, Ralf Schumacher said that tensions between him and his brother had eased and that there were no hard feelings for each other, saying, [...] "It's a lot of fun when we are <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> track duelling against each other." [...] There was similar ill-feeling between de la Rosa and Alesi after their collision on lap two. de la Rosa accused Alesi of blocking him, and of causing the crash by not looking in his mirrors, while Alesi said de la Rosa attempted to overtake him in a corner where overtaking is difficult.|$|E
500|$|Braun {{collected}} several awards at season's end. He won the 2007 NL Rookie of the Year Award in a vote by 32 {{members of}} the Baseball Writers' Association of America. He beat out Troy Tulowitzki by 2 points in the closest NL vote since the system was revised in 1980. Of all prior NL Rookies of the Year, only Pujols and Willie McCovey hit for higher batting averages in their rookie year. Braun was voted the 2007 NL Sporting News Rookie of the Year by 488 major league players and 30 managers. Braun also received the 2007 Players Choice NL Most Outstanding Rookie in a vote by his fellow major league players. [...] "When your peers recognize you with an award, that's great", he said. [...] "Those are the guys <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> field with you, competing against you. Their opinion counts the most, for a player." [...] In voting for the NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award, Braun received two 10th-place votes and finished 24th overall.|$|E

500|$|The filmmakers {{decided that}} Dredd should appear lean and fast like a boxer rather than bulky like [...] "someone who spends hours sort of steroiding himself up." [...] His Judge uniform was altered from the comic version; an {{extruded}} eagle statuette {{was removed from}} his shoulder pad to emphasise the outfit's functionality {{and give it a}} sense of realism. Garland said: [...] "If you did a very faithful adaptation of the uniform you'd have someone who if he got stabbed in the stomach he’d be in big trouble. Dredd is <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> frontline so he needed protection." [...] Remaining faithful to the comic, Dredd's face, except for his mouth, is never shown and his helmet is not removed throughout the film. Urban said: [...] "He {{is supposed to be the}} faceless representative of the law and I think that is part of his enigma...You wouldn't get to the end of a Sergio Leone Western and go, 'God, I didn't even know the character's name!' It's irrelevant." ...|$|E

[...] a major problem [...] People at the highest levels of the military are involved in the facilitation [...] In other African countries government officials are part of the problem. In Guinea-Bissau, it is the government itself that is the problem." [...] A sentiment echoed by regional UN staff. The head of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime for West and Central Africa Pierre Lapaque also said: [...] "There has clearly been an increase in Guinea-Bissau in the last several months. We are seeing more and more drugs regularly arriving in this country;" [...] while the EU's ambassador to the country Joaquin Gonzalez-Ducay added: [...] "As a country it is controlled by those who formed the coup d’état. They can do what they want to do. Now they have free rein." ...|$|E
500|$|The SCLC's {{goals were}} {{to fill the}} jails with protesters to force the city {{government}} to negotiate as demonstrations continued. However, not enough people were arrested to affect {{the functioning of the}} city and the wisdom of the plans were being questioned in the black community. The editor of The Birmingham World, the city's black newspaper, called the direct actions by the demonstrators [...] "wasteful and worthless", and urged black citizens to use the courts to change the city's racist policies. Most white residents of Birmingham expressed shock at the demonstrations. White religious leaders denounced King and the other organizers, saying that [...] "a cause should be pressed in the courts and the negotiations among local leaders, and not in the streets". Some white Birmingham residents were supportive as the boycott continued. When one black woman entered Loveman's department store to buy her children Easter shoes, a white saleswoman said to her, [...] "Negro, ain't you ashamed of yourself, your people <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street getting put in jail and you in here spending money and I'm not going to sell you any, you'll have to go some other place." [...] King promised a protest every day until [...] "peaceful equality had been assured" [...] and expressed doubt that the new mayor would ever voluntarily desegregate the city.|$|E

500|$|A fourth {{team was}} {{introduced}} to the World Series Cup in 1994–95—Australia A—for the only time. The Australian selectors re-shuffled both teams so that some players stepped up from the A team to the main Australian team, and vice versa, during the competition, depending on their performance. The Australian captain Mark Taylor was not a fan of the innovation: [...] "... <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> field there was an ultra-competitive attitude by blokes of both teams, spurred on by the crows who were barracking for against Australia and supporting the underdog Australia A, who were pepped up and firing. Of course it gave the Australia A guys a chance to break into the Australian team, but to me the focus of the summer was on beating the Poms [...] in the Tests and winning the World Series, not beating our own Australian mates." [...] Despite the negative feedback, the concept gave Ponting a chance on the international stage, and he scored 161 runs at 26.83 with one half-century. Two weeks after the World Series, Ponting was selected in the squad for the upcoming one-day tri-series involving South Africa, India and hosts New Zealand. Trent Bouts, a cricket writer for The Australian said: [...] "His selection at age 20 would normally represent a bold gamble on youth but so precocious are his talents it amounts to a routine progression." [...] Ponting made his ODI debut against South Africa at the Basin Reserve in Wellington on 15 February 1995.|$|E

2500|$|Somewhat surprisingly, [...] "swing dance" [...] was not {{commonly}} used to identify a group of dances until {{the latter half of}} the 20th century. Historically, the term [...] "Swing" [...] referred to the style of jazz music, which inspired the evolution of the dance. Jitterbug is an umbrella term that denotes all forms of swing dance, though it is often used as a synonym for the six-count derivative of Lindy Hop called [...] "East Coast Swing". [...] It was also common to use the word to identify a kind of dancer (i.e., a swing dancer). [...] A [...] "jitterbug" [...] might prefer to dance Lindy Hop, Shag, or any of the other swing dances. [...] The term was famously associated with swing era band leader Cab Calloway because, as he put it, [...] " [...] look like a bunch of jitterbugs <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor due to their fast, often bouncy movements." ...|$|E
