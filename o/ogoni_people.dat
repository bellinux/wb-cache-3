2500|$|Ken Saro-Wiwa, {{a writer}} hailing from Ogoniland of the Niger Delta, {{was a regular}} critic of the Nigerian Government. In the 1990s, he led many protests, {{fighting}} for the Niger Delta oil pollution to be cleaned up and well maintained. He {{was one of the}} pioneers of the [...] "Movement for the Survival of the <b>Ogoni</b> <b>People</b> (MOSOP)". Many of the Delta protests led by Saro-Wiwa targeted oil giant company Royal Dutch Shell, who was {{a major player in the}} Nigerian oil business at the time. In 1995, Saro-Wiwa along with nine other environmentalists were arrested and executed by the then military dictatorship Government of Sani Abacha. The news generated international outrage, leading to the suspension of Nigeria from the British Commonwealth until 1999.|$|E
5000|$|An intensively {{productive}} scholar, {{he works}} {{on a variety of}} themes from African development to contemporary geopolitics, social movements and oil politics.

His first major study, Silent Violence, dealt with the effects of colonialism on the susceptibility of Northern Nigerians to food shortage and famine. Over the last decade he has continued to work in Nigeria, but on the political ecology of oil and the effect of oil exploitation on <b>Ogoni</b> <b>peoples</b> in the Niger delta.|$|R

International and Comparative Law Quarterly, 63 (03), 665 - 697 The {{almost two}} decade-long bonanza of civil {{litigation}} concerning gross {{human rights violations}} committed by corporations under the US Alien Tort Statute 1789 was scaled back by the US Supreme Court in Kiobel v Royal Dutch Petroleum in April 2013. The court restricted the territorial reach of human rights claims against transnational corporations by holding that the presumption against extra-territoriality applied to the Act. Thus Shell, the Dutch/British defendant, and the role it played in the brutal suppression by the Nigerian military of the <b>Ogoni</b> <b>peoples?</b> protest movement against the environmental devastation caused by oil exploration, lay outside the territorial scope of the Act. Legal accountability must lie in a State with a stronger connection with the dispute. While this article briefly engages with the Supreme Court decision, its main {{focus is on the}} attitude of Western governments to the corporate human rights litigation under the ATS as articulated in their amicus briefs. In these briefs they objected to the statute?s excessive extraterritoriality and horizontal application of human rights to artificial non-State actors. In these two respects corporate ATS litigation created significant inroads into the conventional State-centric approach to human rights and thus provided an opportunity for more effective human rights enjoyment. This article tests the validity of the objections of Western governments to corporate human rights obligations under the ATS against the norms of public international law and against the substantive demands arising out of the shortfalls of the international human rights enforcement. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
