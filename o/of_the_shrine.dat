5|$|The basic {{floor plan}} {{is defined by}} the size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shrine,</b> the size of the sanctum, the {{distribution}} of the building mass, and by the pradakshina (path for circumambulation), if there is one.|$|E
5|$|Structure 6 is {{a temple}} on the {{northeast}} side of Plaza 1. It rises in stepped sections topped by a summit shrine and was accessed via a stairway from the plaza that divided in two near the summit. Only the lower sections of the walls and columns <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shrine</b> remain.|$|E
50|$|December 10 Tehreek-i-Taliban militants blew up two shrines in Khyber Agency. A {{caretaker}} <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shrines</b> {{was killed}} by unknown gunmen.|$|R
25|$|A {{system of}} social {{hierarchy}} {{developed as a}} result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shrine's</b> Adab. <b>The</b> diwan {{and his family were}} considered the most important, followed by <b>the</b> <b>shrine's</b> khalifas, members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chisti class, chiefs of local agricultural clans.|$|R

5|$|The Shrine {{is managed}} by the Shrine of Remembrance Trustees, ten {{individuals}} appointed by the Governor in Council, {{on the advice of}} the Minister for Veterans' Affairs in the Victorian Government. The Trustees are responsible for the care, management, maintenance and preservation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shrine</b> and Shrine Reserve.|$|E
5|$|The medieval {{phase of}} the history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shrine</b> began {{with the arrival of}} Kalyanagiri Swamy from North India {{sometimes}} during the 16th or 17th century. He identified the very spot of the shrines and their mythic associations with characters and events as expounded in Kanda Puranam. Following his re-establishment of the forest shrine, it again became a place of pilgrimage for Indian and Sri Lankan Hindus. The shrine also attracted local Sinhala Buddhist devotees. The caretakers of the shrines were people of the forest who were of indigenous Vedda or mixed Vedda and Sinhalese lineages. The shrines popularity increased with the veneration of the place by the kings of the Kingdom of Kandy, the last indigenous kingdom before colonial occupation of the island. When Indian indentured workers were brought in after the British occupation in 1815, they too began to participate in the pilgrimage in droves, thus the popularity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shrine</b> increased amongst all sections of the people.|$|E
5|$|A granite wall {{surrounds}} the temple, enclosing all its shrines and six of its seven bodies of water. The rajagopuram, the temple's gateway tower, is unfinished. A swastika shaped temple tank built in 800 AD by Kamban Araiyan {{during the reign}} of Dantivarman is outside the temple complex. The Vijayanagar and Nayak kings commissioned paintings on the walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shrine</b> of Pudarikakshan, some of which are still present.|$|E
50|$|Hakone Shrine {{has a small}} museum, which {{displays}} a number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shrine’s</b> treasures. These include five items which are ranked as national Important Cultural Property.|$|R
25|$|Reports {{indicated}} that no neighborhood was left intact after the uprising. In <b>the</b> vicinity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shrines</b> <b>of</b> Husayn ibn Ali and Abbas ibn Ali, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> buildings surrounding <b>the</b> <b>shrines</b> were completely reduced to rubble. <b>The</b> <b>shrines</b> themselves were scarred from bullet marks and tank fire. They were, however, quickly restored by the Shiite donations.|$|R
25|$|At <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> Sayid Muhammad's {{death in}} 1934, another crisis over {{inheritance}} erupted as some members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shrine's</b> baradari bodies disputed <b>the</b> succession <b>of</b> a minor, Ghulam Qutb ad-Din, {{to the role}} which they argued was inappropriate to be filled by a young man. British Courts accepted Ghulam Qutb ad-Din as the next successor, and established a caretaker system for <b>the</b> <b>shrine</b> until he reached maturity, and arranged for his training and education at Lahore's prestigious Aitchison College - a plan which was met with resistance by members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> baradari who feared that an education there would signal the diwan's integration into the British values system, rather than that of Islam. British attempts at resolution were seen as interference in <b>the</b> <b>shrine's</b> religious affairs, and eroded <b>the</b> legitimacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shrine's</b> diwan system.|$|R
5|$|Archaeologists {{believe that}} the brick shrine was {{destroyed}} either by a cyclone or a tsunami which took place 2,200 years ago. The Pallavas built a granite temple on the brick foundation in the 8th century AD, which also was {{likely to have been}} destroyed by a tsunami. Archaeologists {{believe that the}} second tsunami must have occurred in the 13th century AD as the latest inscriptions which speak <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shrine</b> have been dated to 1215.|$|E
5|$|Edwards {{was made}} a Fellow of the Australian Institute of International Affairs in 2009.

5|$|Extant {{documentation}} {{makes it}} possible to follow the competition more clearly than in the case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shrine</b> dei Miracoli, and the delivered works, their dates and respective payments lend themselves to interesting analyses. By Tamagnino's arrival in 1499, Cairano already had delivered at least five different Caesars and other stone material, but only a payment for a single bust is documented, because his attention was completely taken up with two gigantic angular trophies that he had recently begun. In November 1499, Tamagnino delivered four Caesars and three leonine busts, which showcased his calibre and scale of production.|$|E
2500|$|Such traditions {{included}} <b>the</b> tying <b>of</b> a turban (dastar bandi) {{to signify}} inheritance of Baba Farid's spiritual authority, <b>the</b> regularization <b>of</b> qawwali music, establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shrine's</b> free kitchen, and opening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tomb's southern door to allow {{visitors to the}} urs festival to directly pass <b>the</b> <b>shrine's</b> most sacred area. Devotees would also pass through <b>the</b> <b>shrine's</b> Beheshti Darwaza in order to symbolically enter paradise.|$|R

50|$|About 432 he {{was elected}} and consecrated Bishop of Bologna, where he erected a church to Saint Stephen (Santo Stefano), <b>the</b> {{building}} scheme <b>of</b> which was in imitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shrines</b> on Golgotha and over the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.|$|R
5|$|More {{than half}} a century after the capture of Jerusalem, in 691, the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik {{commissioned}} the construction of the Dome of the Rock over a large outcropping of bedrock on the Temple Mount. The 10th-century historian al-Muqaddasi wrote that Abd al-Malik built the shrine in order to compete in grandeur with the city's Christian churches. Whatever the intention, the impressive splendor and scale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shrine</b> is seen as having helped significantly in solidifying the attachment of Jerusalem to the early Muslim faith.|$|E
5|$|One of the Sinhala legends tells {{that when}} Skanda-Kumara moved to Sri Lanka, {{he asked for}} refuge from Tamils. The Tamils refused, {{and he came to}} live with the Sinhalese in Kataragama. As a penance for their refusal, the deity forced Tamils to indulge in body {{piercing}} and fire walking in his annual festival. This legend tries to explain the location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shrine</b> as well as the traditional patterns of worship by Tamils. Another Sinhala legends attests that Kataragama deviyo was the deity worshiped by Dutugamunu in the 1st century BCE, before his war with Ellalan, and that Dutugamunu had the shrine erected to Skanda-Kumara at Kataragama after his victory. This legend has no corroboration in the Mahavamsa, the historic annals about Dutugamunu. Another Sinhala legend makes Kataragama deviyo a deification of a Tamil spy sent by Elara to live amongst the Sinhalese or a Tamil juggler who made the locals deify him after his death. Yet another legend says that Kataragama deviyo is a deification of the legendary king Mahasena, who is born as a bodhisattva or Buddha in waiting. Anthropologists Richard Gombrich and Gananath Obeyesekere were able to identify new strands of these legends and the originators of these legends since the 1970s, with the burgeoning popularity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shrine</b> and its deity amongst the Sinhala Buddhists.|$|E
5|$|The Western Ganga {{style of}} {{architecture}} {{was influenced by}} the Pallava and Badami Chalukya architectural features, in addition to indigenous Jain features. The Ganga pillars with a conventional lion at the base and a circular shaft of the pillar on its head, the stepped Vimana <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shrine</b> with horizontal mouldings and square pillars were features inherited from the Pallavas. These features are also found in structures built by their subordinates, the Banas and Nolambas.|$|E
50|$|According to the Catholic Bishops Conference <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Philippines, <b>the</b> <b>Shrine</b> and its {{attached}} convent {{were initially}} dedicated to Saint Thérèse of Lisieux; a grotto statue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saint on <b>the</b> <b>shrine</b> grounds memorialises her patronage.|$|R

5|$|The cave temples, {{numbered}} 1 to 4 in {{the order}} of their creation, in the town of Badamithe capital city of the Chalukya kingdom (also known as Early Chalukyas)are dated from the late 6th century onwards. The exact dating is known only for Cave 3, which is a temple dedicated to Vishnu. An inscription found here records the dedication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shrine</b> by Mangalesha in Saka 500 (lunar calendar, 578/579CE). The inscription, written in the old Kannada language, has enabled the dating of these rock cave temples to the 6th century.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{security}} for the Shrine has been provided by the Shrine Guard, whose members were men with a military background. All of the original twelve members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shrine</b> Guard had won bravery medals during World War I. When the Shrine Guard merged with the Victoria Police Protective Service, some civilians began to serve. During the hours the Shrine {{is open to the}} public or in use for any ceremony, they wear a uniform representing an Australian Light Horseman of World War I, with Victoria Police Force insignia.|$|E
5|$|After {{penetrating}} Ganon, {{the four}} Links firmly seal him inside the Four Sword, bringing chaos and horror to an end. Peace returns to Hyrule, {{the souls of}} the knights are freed from their torment, and the people celebrate as all traces of evil that plagued Hyrule are vanquished. With Ganon defeated and sealed inside, Link returns the Four Sword that sealed darkness away back to its resting pedestal and the four Links become one again. After the battle, The Maidens <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shrine</b> use their powers and create a barrier, which is strong enough for the Four Sword to rest before the six maidens leave. Thus, Link's journey has ended and both he and Zelda leave the Sanctuary as Darkness fades away and Light endures in the Land of Hyrule, bringing peace and prosperity.|$|E
50|$|During the Meiji period, {{the emperor}} {{was faced with}} public {{pressure}} to include Kanda <b>Shrine</b> in <b>the</b> Tokyo Ten <b>Shrines</b> (Tokyo Jissha), but hesitated to do so because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shrine's</b> association with Masakado, who {{was seen as an}} anti-government figure. This was temporarily resolved by removing Taira no Masakado as an enshrined kami. However, Masakado's spirit proved so popular amongst the commoners, that it was symbolically returned to <b>the</b> <b>shrine</b> after WWII.|$|R
25|$|The Umayyad and Abbasid caliphs {{prevented}} construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shrines</b> and discouraged {{pilgrimage to}} the sites. The tomb and its annexes were destroyed by Abbasid caliph Al-Mutawakkil in 850-851 and Shi'a pilgrimage was prohibited, but shrines in Karbala and Najaf were built by the Buwayhid emir 'Adud al-Daula in 979-80.|$|R

5|$|Burial 21 was {{the first}} corbel-vaulted tomb to be {{constructed}} in the Mundo Perdido; it was placed within Structure 5D-86. The deceased was interred upon the east-west axis running through {{the centre of the}} E-Group during the transition between the Late Preclassic and the Early Classic periods. The tomb was elite-status and was perhaps the earliest royal burial in the Mundo Perdido. Any funerary offerings were removed during the 6th century AD during remodelling of the temple, at which time the offerings were redeposited under the third chamber <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shrine.</b> The offerings included three polychrome plates with mammiform legs; the painted designs on the plates perhaps have astronomical significance.|$|E
5|$|By the Late Middle Ages, {{the royal}} touch {{had become an}} {{integral}} part of the coronation of the French monarch at Reims Cathedral. The rite included the anointing of the king's hands, which was believed to confer on him the ability to cure. The coronation and anointing were immediately followed by a journey to Corbeny, the site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shrine</b> of Saint Marcouf (d. 558), patron saint of scrofulous people. After the pilgrimage was completed, the newly crowned king was deemed to possess the sacred power of touch. On his deathbed, Philip IV (r. 1285–1314) reportedly instructed his son and heir, Louis X (r. 1314–1316), about healing scrofula by touch. Philip VI (r. 1328–1350), the first Valois king, sought to demonstrate that he shared the thaumaturgic powers of his sovereign cousins and ancestors, thus proving himself as their rightful heir. He touched 35 people between 1 January and 30 June 1337; some of them had come from Brittany, Brabant and Vivarais.|$|E
