He {{is known for}} discovering new caving techniques and carefully recording his finds. Balch would spend his free time on Saturdays and after work on caving expeditions, although he would not do any caving on Sundays, for religious reasons. He would set <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> expeditions directly after work, caving overnight and coming home in time to wash before returning to work.|$|E
5|$|Lead metal {{has several}} useful {{mechanical}} properties, including high density, low melting point, ductility, and relative inertness.

5|$|There {{are several}} methods to render {{matrices}} {{into a more}} easily accessible form. They are generally referred to as matrix decomposition or matrix factorization techniques. The interest of all these techniques is that they preserve certain properties of the matrices in question, such as determinant, rank or inverse, so that these quantities can be calculated after applying the transformation, or that certain matrix operations are algorithmically easier to carry <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> types of matrices.|$|E

5|$|From Verbrandesmis a road runs north-west, {{parallel}} with the lower Steenbeek through Merckem to Luyghem, slightly above {{the level of the}} surrounding marshes. Machine-guns nests in the villages, commanded the causeway from Drei Grachten; the ground everywhere in the peninsula was soaked and dotted with large numbers of blockhouses and pillboxes. The French artillery destroyed Verbrandesmis and it was quickly captured but the German garrisons at Jesiutengoed Farm and Kloostermolen held <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time, before being driven out and forced back to Kippe and Aschhoop. German artillery bombarded the banks of the Steenbeek in front of Merckem and French troops rushed across on pontoon bridges, struggled through the mud to the objectives and then attacked towards Kippe and Luyghem. Kippe and Aschhoop were captured quickly but the German garrisons at Luyghem and the causeway from Drei Grachten, resisted until afternoon before being overwhelmed.|$|E

He helped the club qualify for the 2007–08 UEFA Cup via the Intertoto Cup, and retained a regular spot in the starting eleven as Atlético finished fourth {{in the league and}} qualified for the Champions League, but mistakes in the Madrid derby in January 2008 led to both Real's goals and rekindled the fans' hostility.|$|E

I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F.

25|$|By 1943, Italy {{was failing}} on every front, by January of the year, {{half of the}} Italian forces serving on the Eastern Front had been destroyed, the African {{campaign}} had collapsed, the Balkans remained unstable and demoralised Italians wanted {{an end to the}} war. King Victor Emmanuel III urged Count Ciano to overstep Mussolini to try to begin talks with the Allies. In mid-1943, the Allies commenced an invasion of Sicily in an effort to knock Italy out of the war and establish a foothold in Europe. Allied troops landed in Sicily with little initial opposition from Italian forces. The situation changed as the Allies ran into German forces, who held <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time before Sicily was taken over by the Allies. The invasion made Mussolini dependent on the German Armed Forces (Wehrmacht) to protect his regime. The Allies steadily advanced through Italy with little opposition from demoralized Italian soldiers, while facing serious opposition from German forces.|$|E
25|$|There he held <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> six months, while Leo {{sent the}} new Domestic of the Schools, Gregoras Iberitzes, a {{relative}} by {{marriage to the}} Doukai, {{to persuade him to}} surrender. However, when Andronikos heard the news of the deposition of his friend the Patriarch Nicholas Mystikos (February 907), on whom he had placed hopes for mediation, he resolved to flee and asked for aid from the Arabs. In mid-spring 907, an Arab force came to his aid and broke the leaguer around Kaballa. Escorted by the Arabs, Andronikos and his family crossed the border, coming first to Tarsos and finally to the Abbasid capital, Baghdad. The flight of Andronikos Doukas represents a peculiar episode: several scholars, such as Alexander Vasiliev and Romilly Jenkins, consider it evidence of a real plot against Leo, which included the Patriarch Nicholas Mystikos and perhaps also the admiral Eustathios. Others, such as Demetrios Polemis and Shaun Tougher, reject this interpretation and explain the episode in terms of the rivalry with the powerful Samonas. They regard Andronikos's actions to have been purely defensive in character and mandated by his untenable position after his refusal to cooperate with Himerios.|$|E

500|$|After Reading went {{four games}} without a win {{starting}} on 24 January 1976, a late goal from Friday ended this run on 25 February, {{in a home}} match against Hartlepool United; twelve minutes from time, he collected a pass from Stewart Henderson and neatly placed the ball past the goalkeeper {{from the edge of}} the penalty area. [...] "One is increasingly under the impression", the Evening Post reported, [...] "that if Friday was <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time through injury the Reading team would fall to pieces". Led by the free-scoring Friday, the side continued its push for promotion; fourth or higher would be enough to go up. A vital fixture on 31 March 1976 pitted fourth-placed Reading at home against Tranmere Rovers, who occupied third spot; internationally experienced referee Clive Thomas took charge of the game. Friday, who had already scored 18 goals that season, rose to the occasion with an effort that has been described by many sources as one of the greatest ever scored.|$|E
