5|$|Walter and Edith Loving were {{detained}} in 1941 by Japanese forces following {{the surrender of}} Manila. During his captivity, Loving composed a resistance song Beloved Philippines. He was released due to his declining health and advancing age in 1943.

5|$|Chappuis {{was rescued}} by an Italian partisan, Aldo Comucci, a 21-year-old {{who was in}} charge of one of the many {{underground}} groups operating in the area. Comucci and his band of resistance fighters got to Chappuis before the Germans and hid him and two other American flyers from the same plane for nearly three months until the end of the war. The partisans passed Chappuis and the two <b>other</b> <b>Americans</b> from house to house, and village to village, toward the Swiss frontier. Dressed in shawls — but still wearing G.I. shoes — they once walked undetected past a German sentry.|$|E

5|$|In May 1970, Adi Da, Nina, and {{a friend}} from Scientology named Pat Morley gave away their {{belongings}} and traveled to India for what they believed would be an indefinite period living at Swami Muktananda's ashram. However, Adi Da was disappointed by his experience there, especially by the numbers of <b>other</b> <b>Americans</b> who had arrived since his previous visit. Three weeks after arriving, Adi Da said that visions of the Virgin Mary (that he interpreted as a personification of divine feminine power, or shakti) directed {{him to make a}} pilgrimage to Christian holy sites. After two weeks in Europe and the middle east, all three returned to New York before moving to Los Angeles in August.|$|E
5|$|McCain {{spent six}} weeks in the hospital, where he {{received}} marginal care. He had lost , was in a chest cast, and his gray hair had turned as white as snow. McCain {{was sent to a}} different camp on the outskirts of Hanoi. In December 1967, McCain was placed in a cell with two <b>other</b> <b>Americans</b> who did not expect him to live more than a week. In March 1968, McCain was placed into solitary confinement, where he would remain for two years.|$|E
5|$|On September 11, 2012, the U.S. {{diplomatic}} mission in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked, {{resulting in the}} deaths of the U.S. Ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens and three <b>other</b> <b>Americans.</b> The attack, questions surrounding the security of the U.S. consulate and the varying explanations given afterward by administration officials for what had happened became politically controversial in the U.S. On October 15, Clinton took responsibility for the question of security lapses and said the differing explanations were due to the inevitable fog of war confusion after such events.|$|E

5|$|Retired ballplayer Herb Hunter {{arranged}} for three players, Berg, Lefty O'Doul and Ted Lyons, {{to go to}} Japan to teach baseball seminars at Japanese universities {{during the winter of}} 1932. On October 22, 1932, the group of three players began their circuit of Meiji, Waseda, Rikkyo, Todai (Tokyo Imperial), Hosei, and Keio universities, the members of the Tokyo Big6 Baseball League. When the <b>other</b> <b>Americans</b> returned to the United States after their coaching assignments were over, Berg stayed behind to explore Japan. He went on to tour Manchuria, Shanghai, Peking, Indochina, Siam, India, Egypt and Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Some Gabonese mistakenly {{identified}} the United States as a co-conspirator in the coup. Time asserted that French officials helped spread the rumor of American involvement. This {{reached a point}} which some automobile stations refused to help Darlington and <b>other</b> <b>Americans.</b> After William F. Courtney, deputy chief of the United States Embassy, {{received a call from}} a man identifying himself as DuPont and threatening an imminent attack, a hand grenade exploded outside the embassy. The explosion, which occurred {{at a time when the}} building was closed and locked on 3 March, resulted in damage to the embassy sign and the cracking of two windows.|$|E
5|$|Jefferson's most {{immediate}} sources were two documents written in June 1776: his own {{draft of the}} preamble of the Constitution of Virginia, and George Mason's draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights. Ideas and phrases from both of these documents appear in the Declaration of Independence. They were, in turn, directly influenced by the 1689 English Declaration of Rights, which formally ended the reign of King JamesII. During the American Revolution, Jefferson and <b>other</b> <b>Americans</b> looked to the English Declaration of Rights {{as a model of}} how to end the reign of an unjust king. The Scottish Declaration of Arbroath (1320) and the Dutch Act of Abjuration (1581) have also been offered as models for Jefferson's Declaration, but these models are now accepted by few scholars.|$|E

5|$|On April 4, King—a {{prominent}} African-American {{civil rights}} leader—was assassinated. Race riots subsequently broke {{out across the}} United States. After delivering an improvised speech on the matter in Indianapolis, Kennedy withdrew to the hotel he was staying in and suspended his presidential campaign. Community leaders convinced him to keep a single engagement before the City Club of Cleveland. Doing away with his prepared remarks, Kennedy's speechwriters worked early into the morning of April 5 creating a full response to the assassination. Kennedy reviewed and revised the draft during his flight to Cleveland. Speaking in a tragic mode for only ten minutes before 2,200 people, Kennedy outlined his view on violence in American society. He criticized both the rioters and the white establishment who, from his perspective, {{were responsible for the}} deterioration of social conditions in the United States. He proposed no specific solutions to the internal division and conflict, but admonished the audience to seek common ground and try to cooperate with <b>other</b> <b>Americans.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the {{opposite}} end of the camp, three North Vietnamese PT-76 tanks rolled through the barbed-wire barrier in front of Company 102 and 103. From point blank, North Vietnamese tank crews destroyed several bunkers with their guns, forcing the soldiers of Company 102 and 103 to abandon their positions. Those who survived the onslaught either retreated to the reconnaissance positions, or along Highway 9, toward Khe Sanh in the east. About 800 meters to the west, Sergeant First Class Charles W. Lindewald, an adviser to the Mobile Strike Force, also reported back to Willoughby that the early warning outpost was in danger of being overrun. To save it, Lindewald directed artillery strikes on the North Vietnamese troops moving up towards his outpost, but he later died from a gunshot wound to the stomach as the North Vietnamese overran the outpost. At about 01:30, Shungel and his hastily organized tank-killer teams were busy engaging the North Vietnamese tanks that were roaming the Company 104 area; on many occasions the M-72 rockets fired by the Americans either missed completely, jammed, misfired, or simply failed to knock out the enemy tanks. By 02:30, the North Vietnamese had broken through the inner perimeter of the camp, and began harassing the soldiers trapped inside the tactical operations center, which included Willoughby along with seven <b>other</b> <b>Americans,</b> three South Vietnamese special forces, and 26 CIDG soldiers.|$|E
5|$|In December 1941 at {{the start}} of direct {{involvement}} of the U.S. in , Haynes was made base commander of Borinquen Field, an important defensive stronghold in the Caribbean and the first refueling stop after Florida in the southern route to Cairo. The following February he returned to Washington, D.C., to organize Force Aquila, the advance party of the Tenth Air Force, an operation that intended to bomb Tokyo using B-17s and B-24s flying from bases in the Zhejiang province of eastern China, supplied by C-47 Skytrains. In Florida, Haynes gathered a force of one B-24, 12 B-17 bombers and a small group of C-47s. Haynes and his mixed unit flew individually to Brazil, then Africa, and on to Karachi, India; landing in April 1942 with no losses. One of the B-17 pilots, Robert Lee Scott, Jr., wrote about his view of the voyage in his autobiography, God Is My Co-Pilot. Haynes began organizing the supply lines for HALPRO, beginning with aviation fuel deliveries to China. On April 9, Colonel William D. Old piloted the first flight over the Hump; Haynes the second. The airmen were chagrined to hear that, with the Doolittle Raid, <b>other</b> <b>Americans</b> had beaten them in being first to attack Tokyo. A further blow came in May 1942 when Japanese forces captured the Chinese bases HALPRO was to use. The project was canceled and its men and B-17s were reassigned by General Lewis H. Brereton {{to become part of the}} Tenth Air Force. The HALPRO group of B-24s never reached Karachi; instead, the initial group was diverted to the Ninth Air Force in North Africa.|$|E
