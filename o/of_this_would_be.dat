5|$|An {{exception}} to all <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the Primal Zerg, who inhabit the original Zerg homeworld of Zerus (as seen in Heart of the Swarm). The Zerg Hive Mind {{was created to}} control the Zerg, and eventually put them {{under the control of}} the main antagonist of the series, the fallen Xel'Naga Amon. Some Zerg, however, managed to avoid being subsumed. These are the Primal Zerg, who have much the same genetic abilities but are not bound to the Overmind. These creatures are each independently sapient, and if they follow a leader it is because they choose to. Their lack of a Hive Mind also shields them from specific psionic attacks engineered to counter the Zerg Hive Mind.|$|E
5|$|There are {{alternative}} uses of {{food power}} as well. An importer can refuse to continue import unless political concessions are made. This {{would have the}} same effects that an exporter refusing to export would have. An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> American reduction of the Cuban sugar quota. In simple terms, the demand concentration (one importer being the dominant buyer) and supply dispersion (several exporters competing to sell the same product) an importer can try to use this exchange politically to their favor; this is especially effective if the exporter has little else so export (low action independence).|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War I {{the units}} that had been raised {{as part of the}} AIF were disbanded, and the focus of Australian defence {{planning}} returned once more to the maintenance of the Citizens Forces. To this end, a review of defence requirements in 1920 established the need for Australia to be able to field a force of approximately 270,000 men {{in the event of a}} war, of which half <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> maintained in peacetime through compulsory enlistment. It was also decided that the Citizens Force would be re-organised along the lines of the AIF, adopting the divisional structure of the AIF units and maintaining their battle honours. The AIF officially ceased to exist on 1 April 1921 and the new organisation of the Citizens Forces was adopted a month later; this saw the reorganisation of the 88 infantry battalions and five pioneer regiments that had been established under the 1918 scheme, the abolition of infantry regiments and the re-establishment of the 60 infantry battalions that had existed within the AIF, as well as various other units, such as light horse regiments, as well.|$|E

5|$|Why {{they went}} to land {{in the first place}} is still debated. One reason could be that the small juveniles who had {{completed}} their metamorphosis had what it took to make use of what land had to offer. Already adapted to breathe air and move around in shallow waters near land as a protection (just as modern fish and amphibians often spend the first part of their life in the comparative safety of shallow waters like mangrove forests), two very different niches partially overlapped each other, with the young juveniles in the diffuse line between. One of them was overcrowded and dangerous while the other was much safer and much less crowded, offering less competition over resources. The terrestrial niche was also a much more challenging place for primary aquatic animals, but because of the way evolution and selection pressure work, those juveniles who could take advantage <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> rewarded. Once they gained a small foothold on land, thanks to their preadaptations and being at {{the right place at the}} right time, favourable variations in their descendants would gradually result in continuing evolution and diversification.|$|E
5|$|Durkheim {{believed}} {{there was more to}} suicide than extremely personal individual life circumstances: for example, a loss of a job, divorce, or bankruptcy. Instead, he took suicide and explained it as a social fact instead of a result of one’s circumstances. Durkheim believed that suicide was an instance of social deviance. Social deviance being any transgression of socially established norms. He created a normative theory of suicide focusing on the conditions of group life. The four different types of suicide that he proposed are egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic. He began by plotting social regulation on the x-axis of his chart, and social integration on the y-axis. Egoistic suicide corresponds to a low level of social integration. When one is not well integrated into a social group it can lead to a feeling that he or she has not made a difference in anyone’s lives. On the other hand, too much social integration would be altruistic suicide. This occurs when a group dominates the life of an individual to a degree where they feel meaningless to society. Anomic suicide occurs when one has an insufficient amount of social regulation. This stems from the sociological term anomie meaning a sense of aimlessness or despair that arises from the inability to reasonably expect life to be predictable. Lastly, there is fatalistic suicide, which results from too much social regulation. An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> when one follows the same routine day after day. This leads to he or she believing there is nothing good to look forward to. Durkheim suggested this was the most popular form of suicide for prisoners.|$|E
25|$|Induced spatial {{autocorrelation}} (or 'induced spatial dependence') {{arises from}} the species response to the spatial structure of exogenous (external) factors, which are themselves spatially autocorrelated. An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the winter habitat range of deer, which use conifers for heat retention and forage.|$|E

25|$|True/inherent spatial {{autocorrelation}} {{arises from}} interactions among individuals located in close proximity. This process is endogenous (internal) {{and results in}} the individuals being spatially adjacent in a patchy fashion. An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> sexual reproduction, the success of which requires the closeness of a male and female of the species.|$|E
25|$|When {{modeling}} smaller networks {{the objective}} function {{can be changed}} accordingly. An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{in the study of}} the carbohydrate metabolism pathways where the objective function would probably be defined as a certain proportion of ATP and NADH and thus simulate the production of high energy metabolites by this pathway.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} tone and style, Reformation propaganda, while {{sometimes}} serious in tone, was often satirical, featuring word-play and sarcasm.

25|$|An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{breathing}} air in an heliox environment. The helium in the heliox diffuses {{into the skin}} quickly, while the nitrogen diffuses more slowly from the capillaries to the skin {{and out of the}} body. The resulting effect generates supersaturation in certain sites of the superficial tissues and the formation of inert gas bubbles.|$|E
25|$|Bacteriocins are of {{interest}} in medicine because they are made by non-pathogenic bacteria that normally colonize the human body. An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> genus Lactobacilli. These bacteria inhabit the normal, lower reproductive tract of women. Loss of these harmless bacteria following antibiotic use may allow opportunistic pathogenic bacteria to invade the human body.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} for some species to show combined varieties at one time, especially if one variety is opacity-based {{and the other is}} pattern-based. An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a layer of altocumulus stratiformis arranged in seemingly converging rows separated by small breaks. The full technical name of a cloud in this configuration would be altocumulus stratiformis radiatus perlucidus, which would identify respectively its genus, species, and two combined varieties.|$|E

25|$|Many {{species of}} salamander, and {{amphibians}} in general, {{are known to}} have neotenized characteristics because of the environment they live in. The axolotl is a species of salamander that retains its juvenile aquatic form throughout adulthood, an excellent example of full neoteny. Gills are a common juvenile characteristic in amphibians that are kept after maturation; an example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a comparison of the tiger salamander and the rough-skinned newt, both of which retain gills into adulthood.|$|E

25|$|Mythological {{themes were}} {{consciously}} employed in literature, beginning with Homer. The resulting work may expressly {{refer to a}} mythological background without itself becoming part of a body of myths (Cupid and Psyche). Medieval romance in particular plays with this process of turning myth into literature. Euhemerism, as stated earlier, refers to the rationalization of myths, putting themes formerly imbued with mythological qualities into pragmatic contexts. An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> following a cultural or religious paradigm shift (notably the re-interpretation of pagan mythology following Christianization).|$|E
25|$|Various {{people who}} have been awarded provincial orders have been {{presented}} with national decorations and orders, such as the Order of Canada. An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> Gordon Lightfoot being awarded the Order of Ontario. Lightfoot is also a Companion of the Order of Canada. Each province has a limit on how many can be awarded with their order per year. Ontario places no limit on the number that can be distributed (although it is usually around 25). Alberta and Saskatchewan are limited to 10 inductees each year.|$|E
25|$|In {{semantic}} priming, {{the prime}} {{and the target}} are from the same semantic category and share features. For example, the word dog is a semantic prime for wolf, because the two are similar animals. Semantic priming is theorized to work because of spreading activation within associative networks. When a person thinks of one item in a category, similar items are stimulated by the brain. Even {{if they are not}} words, morphemes can prime for complete words that include them. An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> that the morpheme 'psych' can prime for the word 'psychology'.|$|E
