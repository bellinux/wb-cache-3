5|$|Implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> {{will reduce}} waste and consumerism. In fact, {{according}} to official data, the higher income strata {{of the population has}} enjoyed the same subsidies as the poor until now. On the other side, subsidies reduction will reduce air pollution by reducing car traffic in Tehran. Finally, the subsidy plan will increase social justice through targeted social assistance. According to official data, the richest decile of households benefits 12 times more from gasoline subsidies than the poorest decile. Overall, implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> will increase productivity, efficiency, competitiveness of Iran's economy, economic growth, oil exports and per capita income (all other things being equal).|$|E

5|$|On 1 October, Galbraith {{informed}} Croatian President Franjo Tuđman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> {{without providing}} any details. Similarly, Ahrens and Eide informed RSK president Milan Martić. Although early Z-4 Plan negotiations were planned without actually disclosing {{the plan to}} Croatia and the RSK, elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> were leaked to Belgrade and Zagreb newspapers in mid-October. According to Florence Hartmann, in October representatives of Tuđman and those of Serbian president Slobodan Milošević met in Graz, Austria to discuss the proposed reintegration of the RSK into Croatia and {{their opposition to the}} Z-4 Plan. Tuđman disliked the plan because it envisaged a Serb state in Croatia, while Milošević saw it as a dangerous precedent that could be applied to majority non-Serb or ethnically-mixed regions of rump Yugoslavia, such as Kosovo, Vojvodina and the Sandžak.|$|E

5|$|The heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> was the Constitutional Agreement on Krajina (Part One). Part One defined Krajina as an {{autonomous}} region of Croatia, with borders {{based on the}} results of the 1991 Croatian census (which identified eleven municipalities with an absolute Serb majority). Those areas would enjoy a high level of autonomy, with most authority transferred from the central government in Zagreb to Krajina. The region would have its own president, cabinet, legislation, courts, police force, emblem, flag and currency, and the right to levy taxes and make international agreements. Part One also provided for demilitarising the autonomous area. Part Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan,</b> the Agreements Concerning Slavonia, Southern Baranja, Western Sirmium and Other Areas, related to areas where the Croatian Serbs did not form the majority in 1991 (including eastern and western Slavonia) and contained transitional provisions. Part Three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> spelled out safeguards on human rights, fundamental freedoms, prosecution of war crimes, a human-rights court with international judges, and provisions allowing dual Croatian and Yugoslav citizenship for Croatian Serbs. The plan envisaged that western Slavonia would be the first to be restored to Croatian control, followed by eastern Slavonia (where a transitional UN administration would be set up before the handover).|$|E

5|$|After {{the landing}} at Normandy, {{a revival of}} Anvil became {{increasingly}} attractive to the Allied planners. The Normandy ports had insufficient capacity to handle Allied supply needs {{and at the same}} time French generals under Charles de Gaulle pressed for a direct attack on Southern France with participation of French troops. These factors led to a reconsideration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan.</b> Despite Churchill's objections, the operation was authorized by the Allied Combined Chiefs of Staff on 14July and then renamed Dragoon on 1August. The landing was scheduled for 15August.|$|E
5|$|Although no HV attack {{occurred}} in the area during the UNPROFOR mandate, elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> were used by the 3rd Battalion of the PPCLI as the HV clashed with the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina (ARSK) in the January 1993 Operation Maslenica. The 2nd Battalion of the PPCLI implemented the plan in March 1993 to demonstrate UNPROFOR resolve. The UNPROFOR Sector West deputy commander considered the plan impractical except for deterrence, due to security concerns.|$|E

Obstacle breaching and bridgelaying variants may also be acquired at a later date. One of the 1st Armoured Regiment's squadrons was transferred to the Townsville-based 2nd Cavalry Regiment in late 2015, with 14 of the tanks relocating.|$|E
5|$|At 21:00, the British moved out.

Cornwallis {{was followed by}} Howe and Hugh Percy with six battalions, more artillery, and baggage. The column consisted of 10,000 men who stretched out over two miles. Three Loyalist farmers led the column toward the Jamaica Pass. The British had left their campfires burning to deceive the Americans into thinking that nothing was happening. The column headed northeast until it reached what later became the village of New Lots, when it headed directly north toward the heights.|$|E

Two years later, following Iturbide's downfall, the region, {{with the exception of}} Chiapas, peacefully seceded from Mexico on July 1, 1823, establishing the Federal Republic of Central America.
