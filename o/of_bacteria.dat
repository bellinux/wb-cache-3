5|$|There are {{no reports}} of {{dopamine}} in archaea, {{but it has been}} detected in some types <b>of</b> <b>bacteria</b> and in the protozoan called Tetrahymena. Perhaps more importantly, there are types <b>of</b> <b>bacteria</b> that contain homologs of all the enzymes that animals use to synthesize dopamine. It has been proposed that animals derived their dopamine-synthesizing machinery from bacteria, via horizontal gene transfer that may have occurred relatively late in evolutionary time, perhaps {{as a result of the}} symbiotic incorporation <b>of</b> <b>bacteria</b> into eukaryotic cells that gave rise to mitochondria.|$|E

In the latter there was a tendency of decreasement the same as in the peripher, from the main bronchus to the lobe bronchus to the lobular bronchus.

5|$|Depending {{on their}} feeding habits, {{termites}} are placed into two groups: the lower termites and higher termites. The lower termites predominately feed on wood. As wood {{is difficult to}} digest, termites prefer to consume fungus-infected wood because {{it is easier to}} digest and the fungi are high in protein. Meanwhile, the higher termites consume a wide variety of materials, including faeces, humus, grass, leaves and roots. The gut in the lower termites contains many species <b>of</b> <b>bacteria</b> along with protozoa, while the higher termites only have a few species <b>of</b> <b>bacteria</b> with no protozoa.|$|E

However, despite high levels <b>of</b> <b>bacteria</b> being found on ready-to-eat lettuce products, a 2008 study found no incidences of food-borne illness related to listeriosis, possibly {{due to the}} product's short shelf life, indigenous microflora competing with the Listeria bacteria or inhibition <b>of</b> <b>bacteria</b> to cause listeriosis.|$|E

5|$|Bacteria often {{attach to}} {{surfaces}} and form dense aggregations called biofilms, and larger formations known as microbial mats. These biofilms and mats {{can range from}} a few micrometres in thickness to up to half a metre in depth, and may contain multiple species <b>of</b> <b>bacteria,</b> protists and archaea. Bacteria living in biofilms display a complex arrangement of cells and extracellular components, forming secondary structures, such as microcolonies, through which there are networks of channels to enable better diffusion of nutrients. In natural environments, such as soil or the surfaces of plants, the majority <b>of</b> <b>bacteria</b> are bound to surfaces in biofilms. Biofilms are also important in medicine, as these structures are often present during chronic bacterial infections or in infections of implanted medical devices, and bacteria protected within biofilms are much harder to kill than individual isolated bacteria.|$|E

5|$|Classification {{seeks to}} {{describe}} the diversity of bacterial species by naming and grouping organisms based on similarities. Bacteria can be classified {{on the basis of}} cell structure, cellular metabolism or on differences in cell components, such as DNA, fatty acids, pigments, antigens and quinones. While these schemes allowed the identification and classification of bacterial strains, it was unclear whether these differences represented variation between distinct species or between strains of the same species. This uncertainty was {{due to the lack of}} distinctive structures in most bacteria, as well as lateral gene transfer between unrelated species. Due to lateral gene transfer, some closely related bacteria can have very different morphologies and metabolisms. To overcome this uncertainty, modern bacterial classification emphasises molecular systematics, using genetic techniques such as guanine cytosine ratio determination, genome-genome hybridisation, as well as sequencing genes that have not undergone extensive lateral gene transfer, such as the rRNA gene. Classification <b>of</b> <b>bacteria</b> is determined by publication in the International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology, and Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. The International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology (ICSB) maintains international rules for the naming <b>of</b> <b>bacteria</b> and taxonomic categories and for the ranking of them in the International Code of Nomenclature <b>of</b> <b>Bacteria.</b>|$|E
