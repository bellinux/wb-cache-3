2500|$|Villumsen {{rode the}} New Zealand National Time Trial Championships in January before backing off until June. She rode the Giro Rosa and won La Route de France {{and the time}} trial at the Tour Cycliste Féminin International de l'Ardèche before heading to World Championships. [...] "It was a {{different}} year for me but a good year." [...] She said in an interview. [...] "I started late and with a different approach. I trained more at home and then did race after race. I enjoyed it. I was still there on the podium so I can thank my team for helping me this far." [...] Villumsen, a former a Danish national road race champion, switched her nationality in 2010 from Danish to New Zealandish. It was her fifth straight podium {{at the world championships}} in the time trial. She took her first bronze in 2009, 2010 and 2012, and won silver in her former home county in 2011. [...] "It's not bad luck." [...] Villumsen said. [...] "If someone is better, they deserve to win. Ellen van Dijk has been riding very well all throughout the year, she has won all kinds of time trials, short ones, long ones. She really deserved to win. A place on the podium is still nice. I go close every year but something is missing. I'll try to work it <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> {{all the way to the}} top perhaps next year." ...|$|E
