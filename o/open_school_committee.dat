The area of study was at Rufiji district. A descriptive survey design was used for data collection and analysis. A sample size of 47 respondents was involved in this study where by focused group discussion, documentary review and interview methods were used for collecting data.

The study involved 30 respondents; 66. 7 % were males while 33. 3 % were females. The study approach was mainly qualitative using in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, observation and documentary analysis. Three primary schools from Ilala Municipal were studied in detail to ascertain the significant factors inhibiting the performance of the committees. Results revealed that schools did not have organized plan for conducting organized training for <b>School</b> <b>Committee</b> members due to the financial difficulties. It was also revealed that teachers and parents were not participating fully in decision making; this was {{due to the fact that}} the head-teacher feared that they would lose their authority to run schools. Results also showed additional factors as including poor attendance of <b>school</b> <b>committee</b> members in meetings; inactiveness of councilors to participate in meetings and other school activities, low financial capacity of communities; poor committee member experience and knowledge on supervision of school activities.
