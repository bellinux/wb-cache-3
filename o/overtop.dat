5|$|At Aliso Beach, {{the mouth}} of Aliso Creek, lies a {{freshwater}} pond that changes frequently in elevation and extent. Tidal activity at the creek's mouth results in sediment building gradually up into a sandbar, impounding it in a small lake about 0.2 miles (0.3km) long at its fullest extent. Afterwards, the water level rises upstream of the sandbar until one of two factors causes it to breach: either waves at high tide wash away {{the top of the}} sandbar, or the lagoon rises enough to <b>overtop</b> the sandbar by itself. Once the water level rises above the sandbar, rapid erosion quickly cuts through the sand and drains the approximately 3–5-foot (0.9–1.5 m)-deep lake in a matter of minutes. Peak flows through the sandbar can reach , even if the incoming flow of the creek is nowhere near that size. Because of the raised flow of the creek and the construction of a parking lot in the lagoon area since the 1960s, the lagoon has never been able to fill to its much larger, historic extent without breaching. Species such as the tidewater goby have suffered because of loss of their habitat this way.|$|E
5|$|In the lower, broader {{part of the}} estuary near Avonmouth, {{the tidal}} surge {{advances}} as a slight roll in the deepwater channels and the water rapidly spreads across the sands and mudbanks. Past Sharpness, the bore begins to form and when it encounters the large left-handed bend at Hock Cliff, it crashes headlong into the rocks. Reforming, it runs up-river close to the Overton shore before crossing the estuary towards Box Cliff. As it rounds the Horseshoe Bend it keeps to the outside but it afterwards moves across to {{the eastern side of}} the river. Above Langney Sands, the river abruptly narrows to a hundred yards, the sands diminish and the channel occupies the whole of the river. Now the bore is recognisably the spectacular phenomenon that people expect rather than a swelling flood of water. From Minsterworth to Gloucester, the width of the river varies little and the bore continues unhindered, climbing the banks on the outer side of bends and breaking over shallow places. At Lower Parting, close to Gloucester, it splits in two to pass either side of Alney Island. Both branches encounter and overcome weirs and rejoin at Upper Parting, and the much diminished bore continues upstream. In particularly high tides the water may <b>overtop</b> the weir at Tewkesbury, and even the foot of the weir at Worcester may experience a rise in water level of a foot or so.|$|E

Laboratory-scale waves of three distinct types were generated at the Coastal Research Facility to model extreme waves <b>overtopping</b> a trapezoidal embankment.

The inshore wave propagation was measured and the time variation of <b>overtopping</b> rate estimated. The total volume <b>overtopped</b> was measured directly. The experiments provide well-defined data without uncertainty due {{to the effect of}} reflection on the incident wave train. The dependence of <b>overtopping</b> on a range of wave shapes is thus determined and the influence of wave-wave interactions on <b>overtopping</b> assessed. It was found that extreme <b>overtopping</b> may arise from focused waves with deep troughs rather than large crests. Furthermore, <b>overtopping</b> waves can be generated from small wave packets without affecting the applicability of results to cases in which there are surrounding waves.

Wave <b>overtopping</b> can be characterised by mean <b>overtopping</b> discharges but this does not provide information on individual wave <b>overtopping</b> events. This study was focused on parameters related to individual wave <b>overtopping</b> events with a low probability of exceedance. Measurements of velocities and the thickness of water-layers have been performed at the crest and inner slope of dikes. The height, width and roughness of the crest have been varied and also the angle and roughness of the inner slope. Based on these tests prediction formulae have been derived for velocities, the thickness of water-layers, and low-exceedance wave <b>overtopping</b> discharges. The estimates of these parameters can be used to characterise the wave loading on the crest and inner slope of dikes, especially as the characteristic wave loading for the initial phase of breaching of dikes initiated by erosion at the crest or inner slope. Besides above mentioned parameters also other measurements have been performed. This includes pressures at the seaward slope, mean wave <b>overtopping</b> discharges, percentages of <b>overtopping</b> waves, and volumes of water within individual <b>overtopping</b> waves...|$|R
40|$|To {{increase}} physical {{insight into}} wave overwash processes at low-crested beach barriers, wave <b>overtopping</b> discharge events {{rather than the}} conventional average <b>overtopping</b> discharge need to be quantified. Also, {{in order to make}} intelligent use of the many empirical formulations on wave <b>overtopping</b> discharge at breakwaters from literature, a single-valued appropriate slope for a natural beach needs to be derived. To resolve these issues, laboratory experiments of composite-slope low-crested barriers were carried out. The tests deal with overwash on a smooth non-uniform slope on shallow foreshores. The conventional average <b>overtopping</b> discharge concept does not represent the discontinuous character and associated strength of <b>overtopping</b> ow. Instead, e. g. for purposes of morphological modeling, wave <b>overtopping</b> should be treated as an event-based process. In this study, several new parameters such as the wave-averaged <b>overtopping</b> time, the relative total <b>overtopping</b> time, the <b>overtopping</b> asymmetry, the average maximum discharge and the average instantaneous discharge are defined and formulated. A new approach for defining an equivalent slope is proposed in the parameterization of the <b>overtopping</b> discharge that also takes into account effects of the wave period. It is experimentally shown to be an improvement over the conventional approach by Van der Meer (1998), especially eligible for low-crested sandy slopes such as barriers, dikes, dunes, etc on shallow foreshores.

The {{research}} {{was aimed at}} gaining insight into {{the influence of a}} permeable berm on the <b>overtopping</b> behaviour. Moreover it was desired to validate existing prediction methods for the spatial distribution of <b>overtopping</b> for breakwaters with a non-reshaping berm. Wave <b>overtopping</b> was investigated by means of a physical model. The breakwater scale model was divided into 8 collection bins. <b>Overtopped</b> volumes were collected and pumped into floating tanks further down the flume. After the experiment the mass of the floating tanks was measured and the mean <b>overtopping</b> discharge could be determined for 8 horizontal positions on the breakwater. The measured total <b>overtopping</b> discharges cannot be predicted accurately by existing prediction methods. On the basis of experimental data a new prediction method was proposed that achieves an excellent fit for total <b>overtopping.</b> The crest freeboard definition was adjusted to account for the permeability of the crest. The reduction factor accounting for slope roughness was made dependent on the Iribarren number. For Iribarren numbers higher than 6, this method calculates no reduction of <b>overtopping</b> due to slope roughness. The effect of a permeable berm on total <b>overtopping</b> was found to be remarkably different from the effect of an impermeable berm. Permeable berms below Still Water Level (SWL) lead to less reduction of <b>overtopping</b> than impermeable berms below SWL. Berms above SWL lead to wave breaking on the slope in front of the berm. Contrarily to impermeable berms above SWL, a permeable berm above SWL leads to significant reduction of <b>overtopping.</b> The measured spatial distribution of <b>overtopping</b> is associated with a lot of seemingly random behaviour. Large differences were found with the experimental data of Lioutas (2010). It is suspected that the used experiment setup gives rise to significant model effects for the spatial distribution of <b>overtopping.</b> An experiment setup was recommended that is expected to more accurately model the behaviour of the prototype situation. Data on the spatial distribution of <b>overtopping</b> could not accurately be predicted by existing prediction methods.

Although this had always been planned from the beginning, Steve Jobs maintained if the user desired more RAM than the Mac 128 provided, he should simply pay extra money for a Mac 512 rather than upgrade the computer himself. When the Mac 512 was released, Apple rebranded the original model as [...] "Macintosh 128k" [...] and modified the motherboard to allow easier RAM upgrades. Improving on the hard-wired RAM thus required a motherboard replacement (which was priced similarly to a new computer), or a third-party chip replacement upgrade, which was not only expensive but would void Apple's warranty. The difficulty of fitting software into its limited free memory, coupled with the new interface and event driven programming model, discouraged software vendors from supporting it, leaving the 128K with a relatively small software library. Whereas the Macintosh Plus, {{and to a lesser extent}} the Macintosh 512K, are compatible with much later software, the 128K is limited to specially crafted programs. A stock Mac 128K with the original 64K ROM is neither compatible with Apple's external 800 KB drive with HFS nor with Apple's Hard Disk 20. A Mac 128K that has been upgraded with the newer 128K ROM (called a Macintosh 128Ke) can use internal and external 800 KB drives with HFS, as well as the HD20. Both can print on an AppleShare network, but neither can do file sharing because of their limited RAM.|$|E

40|$|Under the {{numerical}} modelling work package of the EU funded CLASH project, the time accurate, free surface capturing, incompressible Navier-Stokes solver AMAZON-SC {{has been applied}} to study impulsive wave <b>overtopping</b> at Samphire Hoe, near Dover in the United Kingdom. The simulations show that the <b>overtopping</b> process on this vertical, sheet pile, seawall is dominated by impulsive, aerated, near vertical <b>overtopping</b> jets. In order to perform the simulations AMAZON-SC has been extended to incorporate an isotropic porosity model and for validation purposes the solver {{has been applied to}} study <b>overtopping</b> of a low crested sea dike and a 10 : 1 battered wall. The results obtained for the battered wall and Samphire Hoe tests are in good agreement both with predicted <b>overtopping</b> discharges calculated using the UK <b>overtopping</b> manual and with available experimental results...|$|R
40|$|The <b>overtopping</b> of solitary {{waves and}} bores present major hazards {{during the initial}} phase of tsunami {{inundation}} and storm surges. This paper presents new laboratory data on <b>overtopping</b> events by both solitary waves and solitary bores. Existing empirical <b>overtopping</b> scaling laws {{are found to be}} deficient for these wave forms. Two distinct scaling regimes are instead identified. For solitary waves, the <b>overtopping</b> rates scale linearly with the deficit in run-up freeboard. The volume flux in the incident solitary wave is also an important parameter, and a weak dependence on the nonlinearity of the waves (H/d) is observed. For solitary bores, the <b>overtopping</b> cannot be scaled uniquely, because the fluid momentum behind the incident bore front is independent of the bore height, but it is in close agreement with recent solutions of the nonlinear shallow water equations. The maximum <b>overtopping</b> rate for the solitary waves is shown to be the lower bound of the <b>overtopping</b> rate for the solitary bores with the same deficit in freeboard. Thus, for a given run-up, the solitary bores induce greater <b>overtopping</b> rates than the solitary waves when the relative freeboard is small...|$|R
40|$|Safety {{inspection}} of large dams in Taiwan is conducted every 5 years. The practice {{does not take}} into consideration uncertainty of dam conditions. The goal {{of this study is to}} determine the optimal dam inspection interval under the consideration of <b>overtopping</b> risk incorporating uncertainty gate availability. In earlier studies, assessment of <b>overtopping</b> risk only considered the uncertainties in reservoir properties and natural randomness of hydrologic events without giving much thought to the availability of spillway gates. As a result, the <b>overtopping</b> risk could be underestimated. In this study, an innovative concept is proposed to evaluate dam <b>overtopping</b> by taking into account spillway gate availability. The framework consists of three parts: (1) evaluation of conditional <b>overtopping</b> risk for different numbers of malfunctioning spillway gates; (2) evaluation of spillway gate availability; and (3) dam inspection scheduling. Furthermore, considerations are given to <b>overtopping</b> risk, inspection cost, and dam break cost for determining the optimal inspection schedule. The methodology is applied to the Shihmen Reservoir in Taiwan and to evaluate its time-dependent <b>overtopping</b> risk. Results show that <b>overtopping</b> risk considering the availability of the spillway gates is higher than the one without considering the availability of the spillway gates...|$|R
