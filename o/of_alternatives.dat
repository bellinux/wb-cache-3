5|$|The Shrine {{went through}} a {{prolonged}} process of development which began in 1918 with the initial proposal to build a Victorian memorial. Two committees were formed, the second of which ran a competition for the memorial's design. The winner was announced in 1922. However, opposition to the proposal (led by Keith Murdoch and The Herald) forced {{the governments of the}} day to rethink the design, and a number <b>of</b> <b>alternatives</b> were proposed, the most significant of which was the ANZAC Square and cenotaph proposal of 1926. In response, General Sir John Monash used the 1927 ANZAC Day march to garner support for the Shrine, and finally won the support of the Victorian government later that year. The foundation stone was laid on 11 November 1927, and the Shrine was officially dedicated on 11 November 1934.|$|E

5|$|The first V-22 was {{rolled out}} with {{significant}} media attention in May 1988. The project suffered several blows. That year, the U.S. Army left the program, citing {{a need to}} focus its budget on more immediate aviation programs. In 1989, the project survived two separate votes in the Senate that could have resulted in cancellation. Despite the Senate's decision, the Department of Defense instructed the U.S. Navy not {{to spend more money}} on the V-22. When the V-22's projected development budget greatly increased in 1988, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney tried to remove funding from 1989 to 1992 in an effort to cancel it. He was eventually overruled by Congress, which provided unrequested funding for the program. Multiple studies <b>of</b> <b>alternatives</b> found the V-22 provided more capability and combat effectiveness with similar operating costs. The Clinton Administration was supportive of the V-22 and helped it attain funding.|$|E
5|$|The {{injunction}} {{against the}} project forced Alyeska to do further research {{throughout the summer}} of 1970. The collected material {{was turned over to}} the Interior Department in October 1970, and a draft environmental impact statement was published in January 1971. The 294-page statement drew massive criticism, generating more than 12,000 pages of testimony and evidence in Congressional debates by the end of March. Criticisms of the project included its effect on the Alaska tundra, possible pollution, harm to animals, geographic features, and the lack of much engineering information from Alyeska. One element of opposition the report quelled was the discussion <b>of</b> <b>alternatives.</b> All the proposed alternatives—extension of the Alaska Railroad, an alternative route through Canada, establishing a port at Prudhoe Bay, and more—were deemed to pose more environmental risks than construction of a pipeline directly across Alaska.|$|E

40|$|A common {{approach}} {{to the treatment of}} instrumental problem behavior is the introduction <b>of</b> an acceptable <b>alternative</b> source <b>of</b> reinforcement. However, when alternative reinforcement is removed or reduced, the target behavior tends to relapse. The relapse of a target response following the removal <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> reinforcement has been termed resurgence. Shahan and Sweeney developed a quantitative model of resurgence based on behavioral momentum theory that captures both the disruptive and strengthening effects <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> reinforcement on the target response. The quantitative model suggests that although higher rates <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> reinforcement result in faster response elimination, lower rates <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> reinforcement result in less relapse when removed. The present study was designed to examine the possibility that good target response suppression and less relapse could be achieved by beginning with a higher (rich) rate <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> reinforcement and gradually thinning it such that a lower (lean) rate <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> reinforcement is ultimately removed. Furthermore, the data obtained were generated to provide insight into how thinning rates <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> reinforcement might be incorporated into the quantitative model of resurgence. Results suggest that rich rates <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> reinforcement were more effective than lean or thinning rates <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> reinforcement at response suppression during treatment, but when alternative reinforcement was discontinued, the group that experienced rich rates exhibited a substantial increase. Although lean and thinning rates <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> reinforcement were not as effective at response suppression during treatment as rich rates, they still resulted in substantial decreases in the target response. Furthermore, removal of lean rates <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> reinforcement did not result in substantial increase in the target response. Advantages and disadvantages of rich, lean, and thinning alternative reinforcement rates are discussed with respect to target response suppression and sensitivity to the end of treatment, and an alternative response rate is discussed. Although a small modification to the quantitative model was able to similarly account for data produced by rich, lean, and thinning alternative reinforcement, as it currently stands the model is unable to account for the finding that alternative reinforcement may not always serve as a disruptor relative to a no alternative reinforcement control...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background A {{wealth of}} quality genomic and mRNA/EST {{sequences}} {{in recent years}} has provided the data required for large-scale genome-wide analysis <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> splicing. We have capitalized on this by constructing a database that contains alternative splicing information organized as splicing graphs, where all transcripts arising from a single gene are collected, organized and classified. The splicing graph then serves {{as the basis for the}} classification of the various types <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> splicing events. Description DEDB [URL] is a database of Drosophila melanogaster exons obtained from FlyBase arranged in a splicing graph form that permits the creation of simple rules allowing for the classification <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> splicing events. Pfam domains were also mapped onto the protein sequences allowing users to access the impact <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> splicing events on domain organization. Conclusions DEDB's catalogue of splicing graphs facilitates genome-wide classification <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> splicing events for genome analysis. The splicing graph viewer brings together genome, transcript, protein and domain information to facilitate biologists in understanding the implications <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> splicing. </p...|$|R
