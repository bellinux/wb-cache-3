25|$|Sexual {{dysfunction}} ({{or sexual}} malfunction or sexual disorder) is difficulty experienced {{by an individual}} <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> during any stage of a normal sexual activity, including physical pleasure, desire, preference, arousal or orgasm. According to the DSM-5, sexual dysfunction requires a person to feel extreme distress and interpersonal strain {{for a minimum of}} 6 months (excluding substance or medication-induced sexual dysfunction). Sexual dysfunctions can have a profound impact on an individual's perceived quality of sexual life. The term sexual disorder may not only refer to physical sexual dysfunction, but to paraphilias as well; this is sometimes termed disorder of sexual preference.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} 19 {{harpsichord}} suites and several variation sets. The suites follow {{the standard model}} (Allemande – Sarabande – Courante – Gigue), sometimes excluding a movement and sometimes adding a second sarabande <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of doubles. Like Froberger's, all dances except the gigues employ the French lute style brisé, sarabandes and courantes frequently being variations on the allemande. The gigues employ basic imitative counterpoint but never {{go as far as}} the gigue fugues in the chorale fantasias or the fugal writing seen in organ preludes. It may be that the more developed harpsichord writing by Buxtehude simply did not survive: in his writings, Johann Mattheson mentioned a cycle of seven suites by Buxtehude, depicting the nature of planets, but these pieces are lost.|$|E

The term truss has often been used to {{describe}} any assembly of members such as a cruck frame <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of rafters. One engineering definition is: [...] "A truss is a single plane framework of individual structural member [...] connected at their ends of forms a series of triangle [...] to span a large distance".|$|E

2500|$|Much {{like other}} black jazz artists {{of that time}} such as Billy Eckstine and Nat King Cole, it was {{particularly}} difficult for Matthews to break prejudice and color barriers. [...] He said at the time: [...] "They said the band was too mixed, a couple of whites <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of Negroes would be O.K. but not 50/50." [...] He was confronted by an agent who hired an all-white group for a Las Vegas show rather than Matthews' mixed band. [...] His frustration extended to A representatives for Decca, Columbia, and Capitol, who liked {{the sound of the}} band and his music but expressed concern after seeing the racially mixed band in person.|$|E
2500|$|On January 27, Federal {{prosecutors}} played four recordings {{from among}} the thousands of intercepted calls from Blagojevich's home and campaign offices. Although lawmakers trying to build an impeachment case wanted to hear more, the prosecutors feared further collaboration could jeopardize the criminal case against the governor. The recordings played at the impeachment trial were taped in November and December and revealed efforts by Blagojevich to collect money from a horse track owner in exchange for signing legislation benefiting the racing industry, prosecutors said. State Senator Dan Cronin said hearing the recordings [...] "hits me {{right here in the}} stomach. It sort of reminds me of some Hollywood movie <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of thugs in a car driving around." [...] Daniel Cain, an FBI agent who investigated Blagojevich for years, also testified on January 27 and answered questions that did not extend to information not presented in the affidavit.|$|E
2500|$|In the Adoption and Children Act 2002 Parliament {{provided}} that an application {{to adopt a}} child in England and Wales could be made by either a single person <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple.</b> [...] The previous condition that the couple be married was dropped, thus allowing a same-sex couple to apply. [...] The Lords rejected the proposal on one occasion before it was passed. [...] Supporters of the move in Parliament stressed that adoption was not a [...] "gay rights" [...] issue but one of providing as many children as possible with a stable family environment rather than seeing them kept in care. [...] Opponents raised doubts over the stability of relationships outside marriage, and how instability would impact on the welfare of adopted children. [...] However, the law was successfully passed and went into effect on December 30, 2005 [...] Similar legislation was adopted in Scotland which came into effect on 28 September 2009.|$|E

2500|$|In 2015, Lyle Jeffs' {{estranged wife}} Charlene Jeffs claimed in a custody dispute {{that the group}} {{currently}} enforces a doctrine allowing sex with women only by men of the group appointed as [...] "seed bearers", defined as [...] "elect" [...] men of a [...] "worthy blood line chosen by the Priesthood to impregnate" [...] women. Under this doctrine, men no longer are allowed to have children with their wives. Charlene Jeffs wrote in her custody petition: [...] "It is the husband's responsibility to hold {{the hands of their}} wives while the seed bearer 'spreads his seed'. In layman terms, the husband is required to sit in the room while the chosen seed bearer, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of them, rape his wife or wives." [...] She also described the [...] "Law of Sarah," [...] in which FLDS women perform sex acts on each other to prepare for a sexual encounter with a man in the FLDS leadership. Lorin Holm, who claimed to have been part of Jeffs' [...] "inner circle" [...] before he was excommunicated from the group in 2011, later described the [...] "Law of Sarah" [...] practice in Jeffs' community as akin to a lesbian sex show with Jeffs participating and sermonizing. Holm also said that mothers who would not take part were sent away to [...] "redeem themselves", and their children given to other women.|$|E

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{synchronization}} behavior {{of a system of}} chaotic maps subject to either <b>an</b> external forcing <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> function of their internal variables can be inferred from the behavior of a single element in the system, which {{can be seen as a}} single drive-response map. From the conditions for stable synchronization in this single driven-map model with minimal ingredients, we find minimal conditions for the emergence of complete and generalized chaos synchronization in both driven and autonomous associated systems. Our results show that the presence of <b>a</b> common drive <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> function for all times is not indispensable for reaching synchronization in a system of chaotic oscillators, nor is the simultaneous sharing of a field, either external or endogenous, by all the elements. In the case of an autonomous system, the coupling function does not need to depend on all the internal variables for achieving synchronization and its functional form is not crucial for generalized synchronization. What becomes essential for reaching synchronization in an extended system is the sharing of some minimal information by its elements, on the average, over long times, independently of the nature (external or internal) of its source.
