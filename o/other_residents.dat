In 1937, Roland Penrose purchased an abstract 'Mother and Child' in stone from Moore that he displayed in the front garden of his house in Hampstead. The work proved controversial with <b>other</b> <b>residents</b> and the local press ran a campaign against the piece over the next two years. At this time Moore gradually transitioned from direct carving to casting in bronze, modelling preliminary maquettes in clay or plaster rather than making preparatory drawings.|$|E

5|$|For {{the rest}} of his life, Marmarosa alternated between living with his sister Doris' family and in a veterans' hospital, both in the Pittsburgh area. Some of his friends blamed Marmarosa's family for keeping him in their home because of shame about his mental problems, and {{suggested}} that the family blamed musicians and music for his instability. Marmarosa himself did not explain his withdrawal from performing. Irritated by telephone calls from a fan seeking an interview in 1992, Marmarosa passed on the news that he had died; this led to premature obituaries being published in two British newspapers. He sometimes played piano in the family's basement or for <b>other</b> <b>residents</b> at the hospital. His mother died in 1995, after his father.

The Brugman family moved to Puerto Rico and settled in the City of Mayagüez where Brugman met and married Ana Maria Laborde. He opened a colmado (grocery store) and became rather successful, only to lose a good part of his fortune {{attempting}} to grow coffee. Like many <b>other</b> <b>residents</b> of Puerto Rico at the time, he resented the political injustices practiced by Spain on the island.

5|$|The Cacchios {{expressed}} a desire to sell the Theatre to the RTC rather than to developers, because the RTC consisted of friends of the family and <b>other</b> <b>residents</b> whom the Cacchios trusted to maintain and preserve the Theatre. To make the transfer of ownership easier, the Cacchios agreed to continue operating the Theatre until such a deal could be reached, and to assist in the operation of the Theatre after its sale to the RTC. By late February 2010 the RTC had raised $45,000, and needed to reach a total of $600,000. After a down payment of $160,000, and paying the full cost of the property, the remaining funds would cover renovations to the building. Over $8,000 was raised in a silent auction on February28.

5|$|The {{original}} {{station was}} situated at a passing loop, {{with a single}} platform {{on the north side}} of the line. The building, which is noted as having been architecturally superior to other stations on the line, contained a booking office, porters' rooms, and an office for the line superintendent. The platform was covered along its entire length. A single-road engine shed was sited at the east end of the station from 1875, but burnt down in 1900. The initial service was six trains per day in each direction, however trains did not stop at Shirehampton on Sundays due to opposition from a local church, but this practice ended in May the same year following complaints from <b>other</b> <b>residents</b> and businesses.|$|E

5|$|Carlton {{then turned}} his {{attention}} to the other six residents, pouring gasoline underneath the door of the far end of the residence and setting it on fire. Draftsman Herbert Fritz managed to break open a window and escape, though he broke his arm in the process. Carlton then entered the other dining room and killed Brodelle. He then hid, waiting for the <b>other</b> <b>residents</b> to try to escape. As foreman William Weston and his 13-year-old son Ernest ran through the door, Carlton attacked with the hatchet. The Westons escaped, but Ernest died from his wounds hours later. Carlton sought out the final two residents, laborer Thomas Brunker and gardener David Lindblom. Brunker and Lindblom managed to fight off Carlton and escape, but died days later from their burns and injuries. With the house empty, Carlton ran to the basement and into a fireproof furnace chamber. He brought a small vial of hydrochloric acid with him as a fallback plan in case the heat became too much for him to handle. Carlton did attempt suicide by swallowing the acid, but it failed to kill him.|$|E

5|$|Two homes {{along the}} Mamee River in Saint Andrew Parish were swept away while <b>other</b> <b>residents</b> in mountainous {{areas of the}} parish were {{stranded}} by landslides. Multiple residents became trapped within Gordon Town and hazardous weather hampered their rescue. A bridge in Mahoneyvale was destroyed. During the pre-dawn hours of July9, the Annotto, Pencar, and Motherford rivers burst their banks in Saint Mary Parish; more than 500people relocated from their homes in Annotto Bay. Flooding took place across much of Saint Catherine Parish with eight people requiring rescue. The Cobrun Gully submerged several homes in Bushy Park. Eastern areas of Clarendon Parish experienced significant flooding, with several communities cut-off or inundated. A sink hole in Halse Hall engulfed 35homes. An oil tank overflowed due to heavy rain at a Petrojam Refinery in Kingston Harbour resulting in a minor oil spill. Petrojam crews cleaned the spill within a day. Some streets in downtown Kingston were flooded. Effects in Trelawny Parish were relatively limited, with J$16million (US$259,000) in agricultural damage.|$|E
5|$|As {{de facto}} racial {{segregation}} increased, so did tensions between {{residents of the}} northeast {{and members of the}} predominantly white male Teaneck Police Department. On the evening of April 10, 1990, the Teaneck Police Department responded to a call from a resident complaining about a teenager with a gun. After an initial confrontation near Bryant School and a subsequent chase, Phillip Pannell, an African American teenager, was shot and killed by Gary Spath, a white Teaneck police officer. Spath said he thought Pannell had a gun and was turning to shoot him. Witnesses said Pannell was unarmed and {{had been shot in the}} back. Protest marches, some violent, ensued; most African Americans believed that Pannell had been killed in cold blood, while <b>other</b> <b>residents</b> insisted that Spath had been justified in his actions. Testimony at the trial claimed that Pannell was shot in the back, and that he was carrying a gun. A police officer testified to finding a modified starter's pistol with eight cartridges in Pannell's jacket pocket. Spath was ultimately acquitted on charges of reckless manslaughter in the shooting. Some months after Spath had been cleared, he decided to retire from law enforcement. The incident was an international news event that brought Reverend Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson to the community and inspired the 1995 book Color Lines: The Troubled Dreams of Racial Harmony in an American Town, by Mike Kelly.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, damaged {{buildings}} polluted {{rivers in}} South Korea with chemicals and heavy metals. The country utilized 30,000soldiers {{to assist in}} cleaning up and repairing storm damage. President Kim Dae-jung authorized emergency funding for disaster aid. Much of Gangneung lost power and water; as a result, relief supplies {{were sent to the}} affected citizens. By ten days after Rusa struck the country, power lines were restored and transportation returned to normal. After an appeal to <b>other</b> <b>residents</b> in the country, the South Korea Red Cross chapter received $49million in donations (₩58billion won), mostly from the country's northwest portion. The agency provided 50,680meals to 16,919families, as well as clothing and cooking supplies. Residents in the country raised about $60million (₩72.1billion won) in disaster relief, the highest such total for a disaster in the nation. The Chinese Red Cross sent $20,000 to the South Korean Red Cross in the weeks after the storm. On September13, the South Korean government declared 203cities and counties as disaster zones, which entitled 8,714families who sustained storm damage to receive government loans. The combined storm damage and floods preceding the storm caused the nation's economy to contract during the third quarter of 2002. The 2003 fiscal year reported a $300million deficit for non-life insurance companies, mostly due to losses from the typhoon. Crop damage from Rusa caused the price of rice to increase to their highest levels since 1980. In the year after the storm, the South Korean government worked to reconstruct damaged roads and provided monthly assistance payments to families who lost their homes. However, many residents remained homeless and were residing in temporary shelters. The country's Habitat for Humanity built 69houses for storm victims in 2003, although that was only for {{a small portion of the}} overall number of people affected. About a year after Rusa hit, Typhoon Maemi also struck South Korea with stronger winds, causing $3.74billion in damage and 117deaths. The damage total was less than from Rusa but was more significant to industrial areas.|$|E
