5000|$|Boxbe is said {{to cause}} {{problems}} with legitimate bulk email senders that rely on bounce filters in order to remove email addresses from databases. The claim is that Boxbe replies to the mail servers with the standard [...] "Click here {{to be put on}} my Guest List" [...] email but alters the <b>original</b> <b>mail</b> headers by completely removing the original recipient's address. Bounce filters require this data in order to stop sending email to the original address. This causes bloating in databases as well as internet congestion.|$|R

25|$|Barbary slaves {{could hope}} to be freed through payment of a ransom. Despite the efforts of {{middlemen}} and charities {{to raise money to}} provide ransoms, they were still very difficult to come by. As European communities increased their charity funding for ransoming slaves, North African states increased the amount of ransom required. Lack of money to pay a ransom was not the only problem. Persons taken captive needed to notify their families of their status and tell them the ransom price. <b>Mail</b> <b>charges</b> were often beyond the reach of ordinary captive slaves, and it could take several months for the mail to be delivered.|$|R

On 1 November 1929 he issued a series of private postage stamps, with a value expressed in [...] "Puffins" [...] in order to cover some of the cost of providing the service. The stamps have to be put on the bottom left hand corner of the envelope, so that the mainland sorting offices can process them. The price includes the standard Royal <b>Mail</b> <b>charges</b> for onward delivery. Puffins are a type of stamp known to philatelists as a local carriage label. Issues of increasing value were made over the years, including air mail. Many are now highly sought-after by collectors and consequently are subject to forgery.|$|R
