50|$|Strikers are {{basically}} spring-loaded <b>firing</b> pins, generally <b>of</b> <b>a</b> one- or two-piece construction. In the one-piece striker, the striker {{is turned on}} <b>a</b> lathe out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> round bar <b>of</b> metal, much larger in diameter than <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> pin, to provide the mass required to detonate the primer. Two-piece strikers generally consist <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> pin attached to a heavier rear section—in essence a hammer attached to the base <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> pin. Two-piece strikers are commonly found on bolt-action rifles, while single-piece strikers are found on pistols, such as the Glock.|$|R
5|$|Chris Brandkamp {{produced}} most of {{the ambient}} and incidental sounds in the game. To make sure the sounds fit, Brandkamp {{had to wait until}} the game's visuals were placed in context. Sound effects were drawn from unlikely sources; the noise <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> in a boiler was created by driving slowly over stones in a driveway, because recordings of actual fire did not sound like fire burning. The chimes of a large clock tower were simulated using a wrench, then transposed to a lower pitch.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War, the Soviet Union {{retained}} {{about two-thirds}} of the population on the islands (with a third being Norwegians) with the archipelago's population slightly under 4,000. Russian activity has diminished considerably since then, falling from 2,500 to 450 people from 1990 to 2010. Grumant was closed after it was depleted in 1962. Pyramiden was closed in 1998. Coal exports from Barentsburg ceased in 2006 because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire,</b> but resumed in 2010. The Russian community has also experienced two air accidents, Vnukovo Airlines Flight 2801, which killed 141 people, and the Heerodden helicopter accident.|$|E
5|$|In {{civilian}} operations, {{police forces}} keep police diving units to perform {{search and rescue}} operations, and to recover evidence. In some cases diver rescue teams may also be part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> department, paramedical service or lifeguard unit, {{and this may be}} classed as public safety diving. There are also professional divers such as underwater photographers and videographers, who record the underwater world, and scientific divers in fields of study which involve the underwater environment, including marine biologists, geologists, hydrologists, oceanographers and underwater archaeologists.|$|E

40|$|In <b>a</b> {{dynamic model}} <b>of</b> {{the labor market}} with moral hazard, {{equilibrium}} layoff is modeled as termination <b>of</b> <b>an</b> optimal long-term contract. Termination, together with compensation (current and future), is used as an incentive device to induce worker efforts. I then use the model to study analytically the effects <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> tax on termination and worker compensation and utility. There are three layers to the impact <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> tax on layoff and worker utility. <b>A</b> higher <b>firing</b> tax could either reduce aggregate termination and increase worker utility, or increase aggregate termination and reduce worker utility, depending {{on the structure of}} the environment. ...|$|R
5|$|In the 1960s, the Merrie England bar and an {{amusement}} arcade were constructed {{at the end}} of the pier nearest to the shore. The 1939 theatre, which is still in use, narrowly escaped damage in 1985 when the early stages <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> were noticed by performer Vince Hill. In the 1980s, a Victorian-styled entrance was built. In 1991 the pier gained the Carousel bar as an additional attraction, and a small tramway to ease access to the pier-head. By this point, the pier had ceased to have any nautical use, but the jetty section was adapted for use as a helicopter pad in the late 1980s. The Christmas Eve storm of 1997 destroyed the landing jetty, including the helipad.|$|E
5|$|In the König-class ships, each gun turret had {{a working}} chamber beneath it that was {{connected}} to a revolving ammunition hoist leading down to the magazine below. The turrets were electrically controlled, though the guns were elevated hydraulically. In {{an effort to reduce}} the possibility <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire,</b> everything in the turret was constructed of steel. This layout was also used in the preceding battleships. On the Derfflinger-class battlecruisers, the two forward and the superfiring rear turret used this configuration, although the rearmost gun turret had its magazine and shell room inverted.|$|E

Mulder then heads to Grissom's clinic in Stamford, Connecticut, where he is confronted by an angered Krycek. The two travel back to Quantico to see Scully, who says that Grissom's body showed no signs <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire,</b> but yet seems to have biologically believed it was burning.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} <b>of</b> , <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> {{broke out in}} the Old Building. It caused {{widespread}} damage to {{a large part of the}} structure, including the two oldest rooms in the school, School Room and Big School. The main concern was to prevent the books contained within the chained library from being damaged, either by fire or water from the fire brigade's hoses. The damage to the building was so great that rebuilding took over 2 years, with the unusually cold winter of 1962–1963 delaying the restoration. Lessons, however, continued throughout on the Allen House side of the high street.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} {{involved the}} accidental triggering <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> extinguishing system which sealed two forward compartments and released Halon 2402 (freon R-114B2), dibromotetrafluoroethane gas into them. According to survivors, those {{affected by the}} gas release were caught off guard and {{may not have been}} alerted in time due to warning sirens sounding only after the gas had already begun pouring in. Some of the victims were reported to have been unable to turn on breathing kits before they suffocated.|$|E

Other experimentation continued, though telemetry through TDRS was lost for around three hours, requiring manual intervention. A fire alarm sounded in the morning, indicating signs <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> in the avionics compartment, but a second alarm remained silent and it was eventually determined to be a false alarm.|$|E

5|$|There are {{extensive}} dunes of unconsolidated Holocene sand {{along both}} {{the western and}} eastern sides of the island. The topography of these dunes varies with time: in 1913, Dakin recorded the dunes as being a good deal higher in the east than in the west, but in 1960 Storr found the eastern dunes to be severely eroded, apparently because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> that burnt much of the island's vegetation in 1935. In {{the centre of the}} island is a low plain with a sinkhole in its southwest corner and a small salt lake near its northern edge. The soil in the centre of the plain is shallow loam, whereas the rim is deeper and composed largely of shell fragments.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{call for}} {{automated}} transponders after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks; no changes were made, as aviation experts preferred flexible control, in case of malfunctions or electrical emergencies. In the wake of Flight 370, the air transport industry was still resistant to the installation of automated transponders, which would likely entail significant costs. Pilots also criticised changes of this kind, insisting {{on the need to}} cut power to equipment in the event <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire.</b> Nonetheless, new types of tamper-proof circuit breakers were being considered.|$|E
5|$|Other {{advantages}} <b>of</b> using <b>an</b> electric <b>fire</b> engine {{were that}} it would not produce loud noises, smoke, dust, cinders and ashes, as steam fire engines did.

5|$|Fire control {{technology}} advanced quickly {{during the}} years immediately preceding World War I {{and the development of}} the Dreyer Fire Control Table was one such advance. It combined the functions of the Dumaresq and the range clock and a simplified version, the Mk I, was fitted to the Invincibles during refits in 1915–16. The more important development was the director firing system. This consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided gun data to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The director officer fired the guns simultaneously, which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. Invincible was the first battlecruiser to receive this system during her refit from April to August 1914, but its installation was interrupted by the outbreak of the war and it was not fully working until after the Battle of the Falkland Islands in November. Indomitable and Inflexible didn't receive their systems until May 1916, immediately before the Battle of Jutland.|$|E
5|$|In 1684, the government, through Governor General Gabriel Curuscalegui, {{approved}} {{the collection of}} a tribute for five years {{for the sole purpose}} of constructing a stone church. The foundation was laid in 1732 during the term of Father Fernando Haro, but it burned down in 1739. It was begun again, and the construction of the church finished in 1767 with the addition of a tower in 1777. The image of Our Lady of Turumba was unveiled in 1788. In 1840, Father Joaquin de Coria repaired the church, but because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> in 1851 which ravaged most of the town, Father Juan de Llanera fixed the damages to the church the following year. Father Juan de Dios de Villayos rebuilt the church roof and bell tower after it was damaged by an earthquake in 1881, and the church was rebuilt again in 1883 by Father Paulino Camba. Damaged by the earthquake of 1937, it was repaired again by Father Federico Diaz Pines with the help of the Confederation of United Catholics (Kapisanang Unidad Catolica). During World War II, the church suffered damage and was later renovated. A major repair was done from 1980 to 1984, when a story of the bell tower was rebuilt and the ceiling was renovated under the Parish Council of the Laity.|$|E
