5|$|Following Asilomar, new genetic {{engineering}} techniques and applications developed rapidly. DNA sequencing methods improved greatly (pioneered by Frederick Sanger and Walter Gilbert), as did oligonucleotide synthesis and transfection techniques. Researchers learned {{to control the}} expression of transgenes, and were soon racing—in both academic and industrial contexts—to create organisms capable of expressing human genes {{for the production of}} human hormones. However, this was a more daunting task than molecular biologists had expected; developments between 1977 and 1980 showed that, due to the phenomena of split genes and splicing, higher organisms had a much more complex system <b>of</b> <b>gene</b> expression than the bacteria models of earlier studies. The first such race, for synthesizing human insulin, was won by Genentech.

40|$|IFNγ is an {{important}} cytosine mediating imune responses, including antitumor immunity. It can affect expression of a lot <b>of</b> <b>genes,</b> which regulate different cellular processes. In tumor cells defects in signal cascade of IFNγ and mistakes in expression <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> regulated by IFNγ, for example genes for antigen adjustment and presentation (APM) or genes for major histocompatibility complex (MHC), were observed. Epigenetic mechanisms, {{can play a role}} in regulation <b>of</b> expression <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> for IFNγ, as well as in regulation <b>of</b> expression <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> regulated by IFNγ, including the components of the IFNγ signalling pathway.

40|$|Abstract Background Traditional methods <b>of</b> {{analysing}} <b>gene</b> expression data {{often include}} a statistical test to find differentially expressed <b>genes,</b> or use <b>of</b> a clustering algorithm to find groups <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> that behave similarly across a dataset. However, these methods may miss groups <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> which form differential co-expression patterns under different subsets of experimental conditions. Here we describe coXpress, an R package that allows researchers to identify groups <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> that are differentially co-expressed. Results We have developed coXpress {{as a means}} of identifying groups <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> that are differentially co-expressed. The utility of coXpress is demonstrated using two publicly available microarray datasets. Our software identifies several groups <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> that are highly correlated under one set of biologically related experiments, but which show little or no correlation in a second set of experiments. The software uses a re-sampling method to calculate a p-value for each group, and provides several methods for the visualisation <b>of</b> differentially co-expressed <b>genes.</b> Conclusion coXpress can be used to find groups <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> that display differential co-expression patterns in microarray datasets. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTranscription <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> for enzymes <b>of</b> the {{ornithine}} {{cycle is}} activated by hormones such as glucocorticoids and glucagon.

To determine the contribution of C/EBPβ to hormonal regulation <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> for ornithine cycle enzymes, we examined mice with targeted disruption <b>of</b> the C/EBPβ <b>gene.</b> Induction <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> for the enzymes by intraperitoneal injection of dexamethasone and glucagon was almost intact in the liver of C/EBPβ-deficient mice.

5|$|The {{discovery}} of RNAi was preceded first by observations of transcriptional inhibition by antisense RNA expressed in transgenic plants, and more directly by reports of unexpected outcomes in experiments performed by plant {{scientists in the}} United States and the Netherlands in the early 1990s. In an attempt to alter flower colors in petunias, researchers introduced additional copies of a gene encoding chalcone synthase, a key enzyme for flower pigmentation into petunia plants of normally pink or violet flower color. The overexpressed gene was expected to result in darker flowers, but instead produced less pigmented, fully or partially white flowers, indicating that the activity of chalcone synthase had been substantially decreased; in fact, both the endogenous genes and the transgenes were downregulated in the white flowers. Soon after, a related event termed quelling was noted in the fungus Neurospora crassa, {{although it was not}} immediately recognized as related. Further investigation of the phenomenon in plants indicated that the downregulation was due to post-transcriptional inhibition <b>of</b> <b>gene</b> expression via an increased rate of mRNA degradation. This phenomenon was called co-suppression <b>of</b> <b>gene</b> expression, but the molecular mechanism remained unknown.|$|E
