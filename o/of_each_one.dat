5|$|Chapter 3 is short, {{and opens}} {{with a list of}} eight asanas (postures), {{followed}} by the description <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>one.</b> The asanas are of two types: one set is for meditative contemplation, and the other for cleansing the body. Both are said to be important in the journey of yoga. Different asanas focus on different organ groups. Of the eight asanas, the text discusses two variations each for the Swastikasana and the Mukta Sirsasana in verses 3.3–5 and 3.13–14 respectively, with claims that each asana helps cleanse the body when these are practiced with Yamas and Niyamas.|$|E

Destroying one of Eggman's robots lets Sonic see its internal architecture, including a screen that shows Eggman's plans to create an empire and drop a floating island into the sea.|$|E

25|$|David Wheeler, {{who earned}} the world's first Computer Science PhD {{working on the}} project, is {{credited}} with inventing {{the concept of a}} subroutine. Users wrote programs that called a routine by jumping {{to the start of the}} subroutine with the return address (i.e. the location-plus-one of the jump itself) in the accumulator (a Wheeler jump). By convention the subroutine expected this and the first thing it did was to modify its concluding jump instruction to that return address. Multiple and nested subroutines could be called so long as the user knew the length <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>one</b> in order to calculate the location to jump to; recursive calls were forbidden. The user then copied the code for the subroutine from a master tape onto their own tape following the end of their own program.|$|E
25|$|The road verges through King Park {{have been}} planted with {{eucalyptus}} trees, {{and in front}} <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>one</b> is a plaque honouring those service men who died during action or {{as a result of}} wounds received; there are over 1600 of these plaques. Originally proposed by Mr Arthur Lovekin, owner of the Daily News, the idea was based on the Avenue of Honour in Ballarat, Victoria. Originally families were required to pay 10 shillings {{to cover the cost of}} the plantings; ex-servicemen provided the necessary labour to plant the trees. In 1920 Lovekin and board member Sir William Loton each donated 500 pounds to clear and plant Forrest Avenue with Sugar Gums. After Lovekin died the Kings Park board renamed Forrest Avenue to Lovekin Drive. Kings Park now has three tree-lined avenues set aside to honour service personnel who died in the two World Wars and other engagements: May Drive, Lovekin Drive and the most recent addition - Marri Walk.|$|E
25|$|ATP is {{hydrolysed}} relatively rapidly {{just after}} {{the addition of a}} G-actin monomer to the filament. There are two hypotheses regarding how this occurs; the stochastic, which suggests that hydrolysis randomly occurs {{in a manner that is}} in some way influenced by the neighbouring molecules; and the vectoral, which suggests that hydrolysis only occurs adjacent to other molecules whose ATP has already been hydrolysed. In either case, the resulting Pi is not released, it remains for some time noncovalently bound to actin’s ADP, in this way there are three species of actin in a filament: ATP-Actin, ADP+Pi-Actin and ADP-Actin. The amount <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>one</b> of these species present in a filament depends on its length and state: as elongation commences the filament has an approximately equal amount of actin monomers bound with ATP and ADP+Pi and a small amount of ADP-Actin at the (-) end. As the stationary state is reached the situation reverses, with ADP present along the majority of the filament and only the area nearest the (+) end containing ADP+Pi and with ATP only present at the tip.|$|E

500|$|Alongside the frankly mythological, Fredman's Epistles have {{a convincing}} realism, {{painting}} pictures of moments of low life in Bellman's contemporary Stockholm. Bellman himself provided {{a list of}} descriptions of his characters, giving a brief pen-portrait <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>one,</b> like [...] "Anders Wingmark, a former clothier in Urvädersgränd, very cheerful and full of commonsense". Different characters appear in different Epistles, making them realistically episodic. There is a fire in Epistle 34; a funeral is busily prepared in Epistles 46 and 47; and a fight breaks out in Epistle 53. Many of the songs are {{about the effects of}} strong drink, from the damage to the Gröna Lund Tavern in Epistle 12 to the masterly portrait of a drunkard lying in the gutter of Epistle 23, described by Oscar Levertin as [...] "the to-be-or-not-to-be of Swedish literature".|$|E
