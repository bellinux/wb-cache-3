40|$|In {{this work}} {{productions}} of charged and doubly charged scalars and their lepton flavor violating collider signals {{in the framework}} <b>of</b> <b>littlest</b> Higgs model at LHC are studied. In the allowed parameter region <b>of</b> the <b>littlest</b> Higgs model, the production rates of the scalars <b>of</b> <b>littlest</b> Higgs model via pp →ϕ^++ϕ^-, pp →ϕ^+ϕ^- and pp →ϕ^++ϕ^ [...] processes are calculated. We obtained that charged and doubly charged scalar pairs can be produced at LHC. Considering the possible lepton flavor violating decays of charged scalars found in literature, final state analysis is done. This analysis show that depending on the model parameters, lepton number and lepton flavor violations resulting from single and double charged heavy scalars <b>of</b> the <b>littlest</b> Higgs model can be observed at LHC.
