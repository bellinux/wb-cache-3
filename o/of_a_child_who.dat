25|$|Thompson's {{first film}} success was one he {{directed}} and co-wrote, The Yellow Balloon (1953), the story <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> is blackmailed into helping a criminal after accidentally causing his friend's death. He followed {{it with a}} comedy, For Better, For Worse (1954) starring Dirk Bogarde, which was even more popular though it is little remembered today.|$|E
25|$|Li {{took on a}} {{more serious}} role in the 2005 film, Unleashed (a.k.a. Danny the Dog), where he portrayed an adult with the mentality <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> has been raised like an animal. Although his martial arts skills were used extensively, it was a somber film with more depth than had been {{previously}} seen in Li's films, and co-starred dramatic actors Bob Hoskins and Morgan Freeman.|$|E

The Little People adopted the boy and raised him in a cave in the Pryor Mountains. The boy absorbed part of their magic, and grew to become supernaturally strong.

25|$|The {{emphasis}} on the oral qualities of traditional story telling are also evident in this short story. The narrator is telling us about his journey, and his anguish during his delirious night. This narration is full of voices, for example as don Chepe and Niña Tina respond to Cuero de Oro's exhortation. Asturias even ends the tale with the final sentence: and the conversation ended. The textual interplay between Cuero de Oro and don Chepe and Niña Tina can also be interpreted as representative <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> is searching for the roots of his identity, questioning those {{who have access to}} this knowledge of another (mythical) time and space.|$|E
25|$|While many {{witnesses}} {{said that the}} Fanchers were in general a peaceful party whose members behaved well along the trail, rumors spread about aggressive and threatening behavior and other misdeeds. Brevet Major James Henry Carleton led the first federal investigation of the murders, published in 1859. He recorded Hamblin's account that the train was alleged to have poisoned a spring near Corn Creek; this resulted {{in the deaths of}} 18 head of cattle and two or three people who ate the contaminated meat. Carleton interviewed the father <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> allegedly died from this poisoned spring, and accepted the sincerity of the grieving father. But, he also included a statement from an investigator who did not believe the Fancher party was capable of poisoning the spring, given its size. Carleton invited readers to consider a potential explanation for the rumors of misdeeds, noting the general atmosphere of distrust among Mormons for strangers at the time, and that some locals appeared jealous of the Fancher party's wealth.|$|E
25|$|Wisconsin law {{contains}} an unusual provision {{making it a}} Class F felony for a person responsible for a child {{under the age of}} 16 years such as a parent to not prevent their child from having sexual contact with another person if it was realistically possible for them to do so and they were aware that the other person intended to have sex with their child. (3) Failure to act. A person responsible for the welfare <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> has not attained the age of 16 years is guilty of a Class F felony if that person has knowledge that another person intends to have, is having or has had sexual intercourse or sexual contact with the child, is physically and emotionally capable of taking action which will prevent the intercourse or contact from taking place or being repeated, fails to take that action and the failure to act exposes the child to an unreasonable risk that intercourse or contact may occur between the child and the other person or facilitates the intercourse or contact that does occur between the child and the other person.|$|E

500|$|Doug Atchison {{first had}} {{the idea of making}} a film about {{spelling}} bees after watching the Scripps National Spelling Bee of 1994 and noticing that most of the contestants had [...] "privileged backgrounds". Atchison also considered spelling bees to contain [...] "all the drama and tension and entertainment value of a sporting event", and felt that this could be made into a film. From this, he got the idea to write a script following the story <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> had talent for spelling bee but was from a low-income neighborhood so did not [...] "have access to the resources or coaching to pursue it as these other kids had." [...] He had the desire of making a [...] "Rocky-like story" [...] and although made it a [...] "dramatic" [...] plot, he declared it is [...] "essentially a sports movie".|$|E
500|$|The {{songs on}} the album tackle {{personal}} {{as well as social}} and political concerns. Vedder said that [...] "you write what comes to you... You try to reflect the mood of the songs." [...] Topics on the album include child abuse ("Daughter"), gun culture ("Glorified G"), police racism ("W.M.A."), and the media ("Blood"). [...] "Daughter", [...] "Dissident", and [...] "Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town" [...] are three storytelling songs. [...] "Daughter" [...] tells the story <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> is abused by her parents because they do not understand her learning disability; [...] "Dissident" [...] {{tells the story of a}} woman who takes in a political fugitive; and [...] "Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town" [...] tells the story of an old lady who has been stuck in a small town her whole life.|$|E
500|$|The {{series is}} {{centered}} {{on the story of}} a fictional restaurant named Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a pastiche of restaurants like Chuck E. Cheese's and ShowBiz Pizza Place. The first three games involve the player working as a nighttime security guard, in which they must utilize several tools, most notably checking security cameras, to survive against animatronic characters, which become mobile and homicidal after-hours. The fourth game, which uses different gameplay mechanics from its predecessors, takes place in the house <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> must defend against nightmarish versions of the animatronics by closing doors and fleeing on foot. The fifth game takes place in a maintenance facility owned by a sister company of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. [...] In this game, the player character is a technician instead of a night guard, who must do different tasks each night as told by an AI voice heard in the game.|$|E

500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on November 18, 1910. The film had a wide national release, with advertising theaters known in Kansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Arizona, Missouri, Texas, and Pennsylvania. The only known trade publication review is by The Moving Picture World {{and it is a}} positive one. The reviewer states, [...] "A clear presentation of the visions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> {{wanted to go to the}} city. The vision is, perhaps, a bit more beatific than the actual city, but it unquestionably represents the imagined city of those who have never seen it. The awakening was rude, but happily the vision becomes real when the father appears with sufficient money to take the dreamer to the city for which she has longed. The acting and mechanical work on this picture are both of excellent quality." [...] Another minor review of theater productions in the Arkansas City Daily Traveler said it was a good production.|$|E
500|$|According to Kertzer, {{the proponents}} of this pro-Church {{narrative}} {{did not seem to}} realise that to many these accounts sounded [...] "too good to be true" [...] and [...] "absurd." [...] Kertzer comments: [...] "If Edgardo in fact told his father {{that he did not want}} to return with him, that he now regarded the Pope as his true father and wanted to devote his life to converting the Jews, this message seems not to have registered with Momolo." [...] Liberals, Protestants and Jews across the continent ridiculed the Catholic press reports. A booklet published in Brussels in 1859 outlined the two contrasting narratives, then concluded: [...] "Between the miracle of a six-year-old apostle who wants to convert the Jews and the cry <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> keeps asking for his mother and his little sisters, we don't hesitate for a moment." [...] Mortara's parents furiously denounced the Catholic accounts as lies, but some of their supporters were less certain about where Edgardo's loyalties now lay. These included Scazzocchio, who had attended some of the disputed meetings at the Catechumens.|$|E
500|$|As Milo {{struggles with}} words and begins {{the process of}} making himself their master, he also has {{difficulty}} with numbers, especially when he speaks with [...]58 <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> <b>who</b> with parents and two siblings (whom Milo does not meet) makes up an average family. Milo has had difficulties in school with mathematics and problem solving; his reaction to this encounter is to protest that averages are not real. [...] The partial child enlightens Milo that there is beauty in math beyond the tedium of learning an endless set of rules, [...] "one of the nicest things about mathematics, or anything else you might care to learn, {{is that many of the}} things which can never be, often are". Late in the book, Princess Reason counsels Milo, who has much learning ahead of him, not to be discouraged by its complexity, [...] "You must never feel badly about making mistakes... as long as you take the trouble to learn from them. For you often learn more by being wrong for the right reasons than you do by being right for the wrong reasons". An index card in the Juster papers sets forth the germ of the princess' [...] "memorable" [...] counsel to Milo, [...] "Quite often the road to Rhyme + Reason is through the right mistakes." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{two most}} overtly [...] "political" [...] tracks on Phantom Power are [...] "The Piccolo Snare" [...] and [...] "Liberty Belle". [...] "The Piccolo Snare" [...] is about [...] "societies {{torn apart by}} war and the waste of human life". The track uses the {{vocabulary}} of the Falklands War (Tumbledown, Skyhawks etc.) but Rhys claims it is applicable to any war. [...] "Liberty Belle" [...] {{tells the story of}} two cartoon characters devised by Rhys, 'Liberty Belle' and 'Memory Lane', the former representing the [...] "bells of freedom", specifically the American Dream, and the latter representing [...] "history's harsh lessons" [...] which Liberty Belle has failed to learn. The song is told {{from the perspective of a}} [...] "bird living almost in a parallel universe to humans, oblivious to the gravity of the games which are being played around us", something which Rhys admits to feeling himself much of the time. [...] "Venus and Serena" [...] uses a story <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> talks to his pet tortoises, Venus and Serena, as he can't communicate with his elders to make a similar point: that people feel alienated from their elected leaders. Both [...] "Out of Control" [...] and [...] "Slow Life" [...] feature regurgitated media buzzwords, with [...] "Out of Control's" [...] "flippant" [...] lyrics designed to create the feel of [...] "an over-dramatic theme to a current affairs programme". [...] "Bleed Forever" [...] deals specifically with the nuclear fallout from the Chernobyl disaster which fell over North Wales, allegedly causing an increase in incidents of leukaemia among children in the area.|$|E
500|$|Steve Giergerich of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch {{felt that}} Sarah and Little Bee are both [...] "so richly drawn that the {{supporting}} characters suffer by comparison." [...] These supporting characters are Andrew, Sarah's husband, Lawrence, her lover, Clarissa her colleague and Charlie, her four-year-old son, who {{for much of}} the novel answers only to [...] "Batman" [...] and dresses only in his Batman costume. Sarah Liss of CBC News deemed Andrew and Lawrence the two least-likeable characters in the novel, describing Andrew as [...] "an ordinary guy with self-righteous beliefs who comes up slightly short when he's tested by real life" [...] and Lawrence as a [...] "cowardly yes-man". Cleave agreed that for Lawrence, [...] "career and propriety are more important than basic morality. He's gone so far down that road that he can't come back, and he's made more villainous for all the things he could do but doesn't." [...] Charlie is based on Cleave's oldest son, who similarly spent six months aged four answering only to [...] "Batman". He forms the emotional centre of the novel, holding the adult characters together, and is a study in the early formation of identity. Cleave explained: [...] "Little Bee is a novel about where our individuality lies – which layers of identity are us, and which are mere camouflage. So it's a deliberate choice to use the metaphor <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> is engaging in his first experiments with identity – in Charlie's case by taking on the persona of a superhero." ...|$|E
500|$|Within the novel, the Law forbids {{violence}} between {{the inhabitants of}} the Place. Despite its seemingly unyielding nature, it is in fact broken several times, though always with [...] "good reason". In the story [...] "His Mate", Lad meets and later must win the heart of his mate, Lady. Lad is clearly [...] "enthralled" [...] by the adult Lady's sexual appeal. As Terhune seems reluctant to note the facts of canine mating, Lady is never stated to actually go into heat. Instead the relationship is framed {{within the context of a}} [...] "human courtly love triangle" [...] when the [...] "showy" [...] Knave comes to the Place and Lady forgets Lad and fawns on the new arrival. When Lady is believed to have destroyed a beloved mounted bald eagle, the master breaks the rules against violence and intends to beat her. Lad, in turn, breaks the rules of perfect obedience and growls, becoming the object of punishment and taking the beating in her stead. At the end of the story, when the master realizes he was mistaken, he apologizes to Lad for beating the wrong dog. Despite the novel's overall theme of nonviolence, the master's [...] "unreasonable attachment to the bird" [...] becomes the motivation for his [...] "cruelty toward the helpless dogs", yet Lad perceives the Master's actions as [...] "reasonable and functional". Though the numerous tenets of the Law forbid violence in various forms, if the dogs harm something of sentimental value it is deemed justifiable to treat them with [...] "any amount of violence." [...] This change is seen as reflecting a lack of maturity in the Master, and his having a [...] "childish fixation on having his own way", showing a desire to have control and order over that which can never be perfectly ordered: everyday life. Throughout many of the stories, a consistent theme is the Master's imposition of will, behind which is the [...] "blind rage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> cannot get exactly what he wants." ...|$|E
