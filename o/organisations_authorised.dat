40|$|Abstract Previously, the {{majority}} of the human genome was thought to be 'junk' DNA with no functional purpose. Over the past decade, the field of RNA research has rapidly expanded, with a concomitant {{increase in the number of}} non-protein coding RNA (ncRNA) genes identified in this 'junk'. Many of the encoded ncRNAs have already been shown to be essential for a variety of vital functions, and this wealth of annotated human ncRNAs requires standardised naming in order to aid effective communication. The HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) is the only <b>organisation</b> <b>authorised</b> to assign standardised nomenclature to human genes. Of the 30, 000 approved gene symbols currently listed in the HGNC database ([URL]), {{the majority}} represent protein-coding genes; however, they also include pseudogenes, phenotypic loci and some genomic features. In recent years the list has also increased to include almost 3, 000 named human ncRNA genes. HGNC is actively engaging with the RNA research community in order to provide unique symbols and names for each sequence that encodes an ncRNA. Most of the classical small ncRNA genes have now been provided with a unique nomenclature, and work on naming the long (> 200 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is ongoing. </p...|$|R

50|$|The {{government}} institutional <b>organisation</b> <b>authorised</b> to make critical {{decisions about}} Pakistan's nuclear posturing is the Pakistan National Command Authority (NCA), {{the genesis of}} {{which was in the}} 1970s and has been constitutionally established since February 2000. The NCA is composed of two civic-military committees that advises and console both Prime minister and the President of Pakistan, on the development and deployment of nuclear weapons; it is also responsible for war-time command and control. In 2001, Pakistan further consolidated its nuclear weapons infrastructure by placing the Khan Research Laboratories and the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission under the control of one Nuclear Defense Complex. In November 2009, Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari announced that he will be replaced by Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani as the chairman of NCA. The NCA consists of the Employment Control Committee (ECC) and the Development Control Committee (DCC), both now chaired by the Prime Minister. The Foreign minister and Economic Minister serves as a deputy chairmen of the ECC, the body which defines nuclear strategy, including the deployment and employment of strategic forces, and would advise the prime minister on nuclear use. The committee includes key senior cabinet ministers as well as the respective military chiefs of staff. The ECC reviews presentations on strategic threat perceptions, monitors the progress of weapons development, and decides on responses to emerging threats. It also establishes guidelines for effective command-and-control practices to safeguard against the accidental or unauthorised use of nuclear weapons.|$|R

The divergences between the ACP and the European Union with regard to fundamental issues was noted by the group, particularly on the need for a formal commitment between the two parties on the principles and objectives of EPAs, as well as the need to address the substantive issues of common interest to all ACP states. While believing that an agreement can still be reached before September, the meeting insisted that 'the EU side seriously engage in the first-phase negotiations and demonstrate a willingness to overcome the divergences that have emerged'. The meeting stressed the importance of 'strengthening of ACP countries' production and supply capacities' and addressing the physical constraints on competitiveness. In this context the importance of the development dimension to the negotiations was stressed. Significantly regional integration organisations insisted 'on the importance of a revision of the existing WTO rules in order that they take into account their particular situation and respond to their development needs'. Comment: Significantly in its dialogue with non-state actors EC officials stressed 90 % product coverage as a defining criterion for WTO compatibility. This occurred in response to questioning on how the Commission intended to accommodate the needs of least developed countries. The treatment of LDCs under the SADC Trade Protocol was highlighted. Here LDCs are expected to liberalise only 70 % of their imports from South Africa (a country classified as a developed country under WTO rules). This, it is felt, allows them to better accommodate the needs of sensitive sectors in the light of the very real constraints which they face. EC representatives explicitly ruled out this option under future EPAs involving LDCs, maintaining that this would be incompatible with WTO rules. This highlights the importance of the call by the NAOs and RAOs for a revision of existing WTO rules.

40|$|This article {{describes}} the actual situation {{at the beginning of}} 1999 with regard to identification and priority setting for health technology assessment (HTA) on a national level in the Netherlands. For this purpose the literature on HTA published in 1980 - 1998, mainly national, was thoroughly reviewed. Many policy documents and other reports from the 'grey literature' of identification and priority setting for HTA in the Netherlands were also used. The results show that attempts to identify and set priorities for HTA is a new activity in the Netherlands. The three most important actors in the field are the Health Council, the Council for Health Research and the Health Insurance Council. Methodologies differ depending on the content and scope of each programme. In addition, the methods used are not always transparent and the activities are not co-ordinated. The lack of co-ordination {{is due to the fact}} that there is no single <b>organisation</b> that is <b>authorised</b> to identify and set priorities for HTA. Suggestions for improving co-ordination are proposed with the aim of developing a truly national effort in this field, which will enable a more balanced and efficient set of HTA activities.
