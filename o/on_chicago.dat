5|$|Demolition Plot J-7 is {{the second}} {{extended}} play by American indie rock band Pavement, released in 1990. The EP was the band's first release <b>on</b> <b>Chicago</b> independent label Drag City, and its first release that was not self-issued. Demolition Plot J-7 shared {{many of the same}} indie and punk rock influences of Pavement's 1989 debut Slay Tracks (1933-1969), but also diversified the group's sound by incorporating keyboards.|$|E
5|$|Historic {{preservation}} in Chicago {{has saved}} {{some of the}} city's architectural heritage. The efforts of the Chicago Architecture Foundation and the Landmarks and Preservation Council of Illinois {{have been at the}} forefront of these efforts. The Commission <b>on</b> <b>Chicago</b> Landmarks (now part of the city's Department of Planning and Development) has designated the Prairie Avenue Historic District as a city landmark.|$|E

It was officially dedicated on June 1, in a ceremony attended by Dr. Norman Hilberry of the Argonne National Laboratory, who worked <b>on</b> <b>Chicago</b> Pile-1, the world's first nuclear reactor to achieve criticality. During the 1962 World's Fair, hosted by the city at the Seattle Center, the reactor {{became the subject of}} group tours from professional organizations.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{opened for}} {{business as a}} hotel on January 15, 2015. It {{is the first of}} what was planned to be twenty Virgin Hotels locations that operate under this business model. The renovation took longer than planned due to the building's city landmark status, which required continuing coordination with the Commission <b>on</b> <b>Chicago</b> Landmarks. Original features that were retained include a 1920s oak cigar bar, brass elevator lobby doors and a tiled ceiling. The final layout of 250 rooms includes 40 single-room suites and 2 penthouse suites. 40 rooms are pet friendly.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{was purchased by}} the Chinese Christian Union Church (CCUC) for $1.4 million and renamed the Pui Tak Center in 1993. That same year, the On Leong Merchants Association Building was designated a Chicago landmark by the Commission <b>on</b> <b>Chicago</b> Landmarks. The CCUC spent $1 million raised from community donations to renovate and update the building's neglected interior. The newly named Pai Tak Center now hosts various religious, community, and educational programs, such as English-as-a-Second-Language courses (ESL).|$|E

5|$|Under the aspices of the Commission <b>on</b> <b>Chicago</b> Landmarks, the {{renovation}} included brick, window and steel frame replacement. The {{focal point of}} the renovated building is the publicly accessible Commons Club on the second floor, with a contemporary-style bar, a full kitchen, a lounge area, curated books and local memorabilia. At the time of opening, four additional dining options were expected within three months. The area was carved out of a former second-floor banking hall.|$|E
5|$|Historians have {{questioned}} the competence of the senior Allied officers. Muirhead-Gould had been hosting a dinner party {{on the night of}} the attack, and one of the main guests was the senior United States Navy officer in Sydney Harbour, Captain Howard Bode of USS Chicago. Both officers were sceptical that any attack was taking place. Muirhead-Gould arrived aboard HMAS Lolita at approximately midnight, an action he described as attempting to learn about the situation. But members of Lolitas crew later recounted that when Muirhead-Gould came aboard he immediately chastised the patrol boat's skipper and crew, and quickly dismissed their report. Junior officers <b>on</b> <b>Chicago</b> provided similar descriptions of Bode's return on board, and members of both crews later claimed that Muirhead-Gould and Bode were intoxicated. It was only after the destruction of HMAS Kuttabul that both officers began to take the attack seriously.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens with}} a {{terrorist}} attack <b>on</b> <b>Chicago</b> by the Knights Templar; a nanite bomb turns the entire city into grey goo, with the staff and trainees of the city's Tarsus Academy facility barely escaping in time. After relocating to Tarsus' Seattle facility, the city's own Tarsus facility is attacked by soldiers of the Order. Alex, discovering with Billie's help that Tarsus has been observing their trainees in secret {{under the guidance of}} Nassif, escapes the facility and is subsequently offered missions by Tarsus, the Order, the WTO, and the Omar. During these missions, Alex learns that their biomods were created by ApostleCorp, and follows Nassif from Seattle to Cairo, which is being disrupted by fighting between the factions. Alex's fellow students follow different paths during the narrative; Billie initially allies with the Order before joining the Knights Templar, Klara joins the WTO, while Leo becomes involved with the Omar and can become an unwilling convert.|$|E

5|$|The {{years of}} neglect {{following}} {{the closing of the}} hotel took a toll on the building's appearance with both the interior and exterior facade crumbling. In 2005, it was announced that the hotel would undergo a $112million renovation and acquisition with a planned opening in 2007 in a deal between Marriott International/Renaissance Hotels and Sage Hospitality, a Denver, Colorado-based company. The hotel's restoration process was quite lengthy because of the extensive interior damage. $22million of the expected $112million was the cost associated with the acquisition. Sage sought $22million in tax increment financing from the Chicago Community Development Commission. They eventually were approved for $18million in tax-increment financing. The final cost of the restoration came to $128million, of which the city of Chicago provided $13.5million for street-front improvement, including the restoration and recasting of over 10,000 pieces of decorative terra cotta, and federal historical tax credits because the building is a historical landmark. The Chicago Landmark status necessitated renovation oversight by the Commission <b>on</b> <b>Chicago</b> Landmarks.|$|E
5|$|M-21 was {{designated}} by July 1, 1919 on a routing from Ionia to Goodells. Along the way, it ran through Lyons and Pewamo, joining its current routing to Ovid. M-21 continued through Corunna to Lennon and Flint. There it joined its last routing between Flint and the Port Huron area. The highway {{was extended to}} Port Huron by 1924, and the west end was extended to Grand Rapids in 1925 along M-16 (later US16). The previous routing through Owosso and Lennon was redesignated as M-71 at this time when M-21 was shifted along the current routing between the two communities. The 1926 creation of the United States Highway System led to the extension of M-21 along US16 to Grand Rapids. From there west, M-21 replaced M-51 <b>on</b> <b>Chicago</b> Drive to Holland. The highway was {{moved to a new}} routing between Flint and Lapeer in 1929; the old route was renumbered M-21A. All in-city portions of M-21 were transferred to state control in 1931 {{with the passage of the}} Dykstra Act of 1931 (PA 131 of 1931).|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{was sent}} back to Buffalo for the 1946 season, now with Gabby Hartnett as his manager (Harris having moved to the team's front office), but missed most of the year with a back injury which was {{attributed}} to overwork. After the 1947 season in Buffalo, where Richards was now his manager, he returned to Detroit in 1948, spending most of the season in the bullpen but making five starts and posting a 3–0 record; he had yet added very little weight since his high school days, being still at 148 pounds. He made his first start, and earned his first major league victory, on August 8 against the Washington Senators, pitching 7⅔ innings and striking out six in a 6–5 victory in which he also drove in a run with a triple and scored. However, Pierce also issued 51 walks in 55⅓ innings that year, and concerns about his pitching control led the Tigers to trade him to the White Sox on November 10 for catcher Aaron Robinson and $10,000, in what most baseball historians consider {{to be one of the}} most one-sided trades in baseball history. Talks had initially centered <b>on</b> <b>Chicago</b> acquiring Pierce's high school teammate Ted Gray, although sources differ as to whether it was White Sox general manager Frank Lane or his Detroit counterpart Billy Evans who switched the focus to Pierce; the Tigers tried to call off the deal one day after it was completed upon fully realizing what they had given up, even offering $50,000 to get Pierce back, but Lane had no intention of giving up the steal he had accomplished in his first trade as general manager.|$|E
