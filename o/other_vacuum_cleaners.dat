5000|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1905 in Cleveland, Ohio by Philip Geier as Royal Manufacturing. In 1955 they built the first {{household}} vacuum with a patented Cyclone system. Since then over 25 million have been sold. Originally the company made vacuum cleaners with metal cases. In the 1980s they began selling the mass-market [...] "Dirt Devil" [...] line with plastic cases; originally the packaging said [...] "Royal Dirt Devil" [...] {{but over the years}} the name [...] "Royal" [...] appeared in smaller and smaller type until it vanished entirely from the package. Today Dirt Devil is the main brand, but the company continues to manufacture the [...] "Royal" [...] line, as more expensive and of a higher quality product. The corporate legal name is the rather anonymous [...] "TTI Floor Care North America". TTI stands for Techtronic Industries, a Hong Kong-based firm and the Hoover, Vax, and <b>other</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners.</b>|$|E
50|$|While regular vacuum {{cleaners}} {{are designed to}} simply contain visible dirt and debris, hypoallergenic vacuums are designed to trap {{almost all of the}} smaller particles which in a regular vacuum are simply re-circulated into the ambient air. While this is not an issue for most people who do not suffer allergies, many with particular sensitivities to allergens (including asthma) can find that this not only does not help their condition, but stirring the dust into the air can make the condition worse.Most modern hypoallergenic {{vacuum cleaners}} use a system consisting of four primary components: the final output filter (generally a HEPA or similar filter), the motor and fan or impeller assembly, secondary particle filter to protect the motor assembly, and a primary filter - a bag, cup or wet filter bucket (each of which provide the initial filtration and retention of most dust and contaminants). Modern high quality hypoallergenic vacuum cleaners generally use HEPA (High Efficiency Particle Arrestor) filters to trap the vast majority (at least 99.97%) of very small particles that <b>other</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> would simply re-emit into the ambient air - ideally specifying a recognised and independently tested HEPA filter grade (see HEPA article) rather than just using the term. Recently many cheaper 'HEPA type' filters have appeared on the market attempting to capitalise on the term, these are generally inferior and do not meet the stringent requirements set by the US Dept of Energy (or in Europe EN 1822) to call themselves HEPA, and have not been independently tested to assess their ability to stop dust egress. While many dry bagless systems include HEPA grade filtration, the user is generally exposed to the very dust and allergens they are trying to avoid during emptying/cleaning the system. Anti-allergy bagged systems avoid most of this risk with a bag that will contain dirt and contaminants, and wet filter bagless systems also allow emptying without exposure to airborne particles as it is contained in a 'mud'. While Wet filter systems do avoid the cost and environmental waste of needing new bag for every filling, like wet/dry and shampooing machines they do generally require a very small amount of anti foaming agent, though this is generally environmentally benign. Some Hypoallergenic vacuum bags differ a great deal from non-hypoallergenic bags. Hypoallergenic bags often come in two pieces, an inner and outer bag. The inner bag (which captures the dirt) will be disposable and completely contained. Outer bags will sometimes take the place of a filter all together filtering out dust and allergens out of the air. Some modern hypoallergenic vacuum cleaners will use the two bag system with the outer bag made up of high-performance filtration material treated with antimicrobials to impede the growth of mold, bacteria and other parasites. A two bag system will still require a final HEPA filter to be able to comply with the standards of HEPA filtration. All good Hypo-allergenic systems are designed, not just to contain 99+% of containments (99.97% in the case of HEPA systems), but to clean the air while cleaning the floors, some, including water filter models, achieving retention of particles over 0.3 micrometer diameter of 99.99% (1 particle in 10,000 released).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} research regarding {{application of}} golden ratio rule in field of product design. The rule {{was applied to}} the design on <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner,</b> as it is a common and widely spread product. The aim {{of this paper is to}} research possibilities of applications of the rule in modern design. In order to determine consumer's subjective aesthetic judgment of products designed by directly applying golden ratio rule, one <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> was designed in that manner. Results for consumer's subjective aesthetic preference were compared to results for <b>other</b> differently designed <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> models present in the market today. Factors used were age, gender and level of education of participants (typical consumer). The results showed no statistical influence of age or gender factors. Statistically significant differences were noticed for level of education factor, between participants with high school diploma and university diploma. It was observed that product designed using golden ratio rule received higher marks regarding aesthetics in case of participants with university diploma. It can be concluded that golden ratio rule can be applied in field of product design, equally successful as in the other art fields where it is commonly used, but consumer demographics must be taken in to consideration, especially education level...|$|R

Electr(on) ic household appliances are divided in 3 main streams, namely: * white goods (dishwasher, washing machine, etc.) * <b>other</b> household appliances (<b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner,</b> iron, etc.). * brown goods (audio, video and communication equipment). About 95 percent of the discarded electric (household) appliances originate from households, the remaining 5 percent from companies. Based on the penetrationgrade, the average weight and the average life span of specific appliances, an estimation of the discarded amount by households is made for the present (1992) {{as well as the}} future (about 2005). The total amount discarded by households between 1992 and approximately 2005 will grow from approximately 117 to 185 kiloton per year...|$|R

25|$|A <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> uses {{a partial}} vacuum to suck up dust and dirt, usually from floors. Daniel Hess of West Union, Iowa, invented the first <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> in 1860. Calling it a carpet sweeper {{instead of a}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner,</b> his machine did, in fact, have a {{rotating}} brush like a traditional <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> which also possessed an elaborate bellows mechanism {{on top of the}} body to generate suction of dust and dirt. Hess received a patent (U.S. patent #29,077) for his invention of the first <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> on July 10, 1860. Despite credit usually going to English inventor Hubert Cecil Booth for inventing the first electric <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> in 1901, his vacuum was actually predated two years by an American, John Thurman of St. Louis, Missouri, who invented the motorized <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> in 1899. However, neither were practical or useful. The first practical and portable <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> was built in 1907, when James Murray Spangler, a janitor from Canton, Ohio, incorporated a rotating brush, an electric fan, a box, and one of his wife's pillowcases to serve as the dust bag.|$|R

We used wet towelettes and a vacuum sampler to collect lead dust from carpets and upholstery before and after vacuum cleaning. The vacuum sampling data showed that the HEPA and non-HEPA <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> resulted in 54. 7 % (p = 0. 006) and 36. 4 % (p = 0. 020) reductions in lead loading, respectively, when used on soiled carpets, although the overall difference in lead loading reduction between the two <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> was not statistically significant (p = 0. 293).

5000|$|Many <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> {{also use}} HEPA filters {{as part of}} their {{filtration}} systems. This is beneficial for asthma and allergy sufferers, because the HEPA filter traps the fine particles (such as pollen and dust mite feces) which trigger allergy and asthma symptoms. For a HEPA filter in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> to be effective, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> must be designed so that all the air drawn into the machine is expelled through the filter, with none of the air leaking past it. This {{is often referred to as}} [...] "Sealed HEPA" [...] or sometimes the more vague [...] "True HEPA". <b>Vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> simply labeled [...] "HEPA" [...] may have a HEPA filter, but not all air necessarily passes through it. Finally, <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> filters marketed as [...] "HEPA-like" [...] will typically use a filter of a similar construction to HEPA, but without the filtering efficiency. Because of the extra density of a true HEPA filter, HEPA <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> require more powerful motors to provide adequate cleaning power.|$|R
