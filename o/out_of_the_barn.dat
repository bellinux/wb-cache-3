25|$|The {{prisoner}} Emma rescued {{is revealed}} to be none other than Maid Marian, who eagerly runs to embrace Robin Hood and Roland. A distraught Regina notes that Emma has done exactly what her mother did: unintentionally ruin her chance for happiness by naively trying to make things better. Reduced to tears, Regina ominously warns Emma that Marian had better {{be the only thing}} she brought back. Back at the barn, a container from Rumplestiltskin's vault (which Hook accidentally disturbed in the vault) is revealed to have fallen through the portal. The lid pops off and releases a blue liquid, which after a moment coalesces into none other than Elsa. She removes her gloves and unleashes an icy blast that destroys her former prison, before heading <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn,</b> leaving a trail of frozen ground behind her.|$|E
25|$|Born in {{the town}} of Hampden, Maine, she grew up first in Worcester, Massachusetts. She was the first child of three born to Joseph Dix and Mary Bigelow, who had deep ancestral roots in Massachusetts Bay Colony. Her father was an {{itinerant}} worker as a Methodist preacher. At the age of twelve, she sought refuge with her wealthy grandmother, Dorothea Lynde (wife of Dr Elijah Dix) in Boston to get away from her alcoholic parents and abusive father. About 1821 Dix opened a school in Boston, which was patronized by well-to-do families. Soon afterward she also began teaching poor and neglected children <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> of her grandmother's house, but she suffered poor health. It has been suggested that Dorothea suffered from major depressive episodes, which contributed to her poor health. From 1824 to 1830, she wrote mainly devotional books and stories for children. Her Conversations on Common Things (1824) reached its sixtieth edition by 1869. Her book The Garland of Flora (1829) was, along with Elizabeth Wirt's Flora's Dictionary, one of the first two dictionaries of flowers published in the United States. Other books of Dix's include Private Hours, Alice and Ruth, and Prisons and Prison Discipline.|$|E
25|$|My first well-remembered {{intentional}} use of {{the double}} bind occurred in early boyhood. One winter day, with the weather below zero, my father led a calf <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> to the water trough. After the calf had satisfied its thirst, they {{turned back to the}} barn, but at the doorway the calf stubbornly braced its feet, and despite my father's desperate pulling on the halter, he could not budge the animal. I was outside playing in the snow and, observing the impasse, began laughing heartily. My father challenged me to pull the calf into the barn. Recognizing the situation as one of unreasoning stubborn resistance {{on the part of the}} calf, I decided to let the calf have full opportunity to resist, since that was what it apparently wished to do. Accordingly I presented the calf with a double bind by seizing it by the tail and pulling it away from the barn, while my father continued to pull it inward. The calf promptly chose to resist the weaker of the two forces and dragged me into the barn. Reprinted in Collected Papers Volume 3.|$|E
60|$|The {{intelligence}} {{was in a}} general sense true; and Henchard's stores, which had remained in a paralyzed condition during <b>the</b> settlement <b>of</b> his bankruptcy, were stirred into activity again when the new tenant had possession. Thenceforward the full sacks, looped with the shining chain, went scurrying up and down under the cat-head, hairy arms were thrust out from the different door-ways, and the grain was hauled in; trusses of hay were tossed anew in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barns,</b> and <b>the</b> wimbles creaked; while the scales and steel-yards began to be busy where guess-work had formerly been the rule.|$|R
60|$|With these words, he {{strapped}} his {{burden on}} his shoulders, and, taking his stick in one hand, extended {{the other to}} his delighted charge; and so they passed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old <b>barn,</b> together.|$|R

500|$|Thompson {{also criticized}} Bill Gates and Microsoft for {{contracting}} with Rockstar Games {{to release the}} game on the Xbox. The Xbox version has since been cancelled for undisclosed reasons, but a version was released years later on the Xbox 360. In August 2006, Thompson requested a congressional subpoena for an early copy, threatening to file suit in Miami {{if he did not}} gain help from U.S. Rep. Cliff Stearns. Once the game is out, according to Thompson, [...] "the horse will be <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> and it will be too late to do anything about it". Thompson argued that it violated Florida's public nuisance laws, which prohibit activities that can injure the health of the community.|$|E
500|$|Promoted to Feldwebel (sergeant), Trautmann {{was part}} of a unit formed from the {{remnants}} of several others which had been decimated in the east, and moved to France in anticipation of the Allied invasion of Normandy. In 1944, {{he was one of the}} few survivors of the Allied bombing of Kleve, and with no unit left decided to head home to Bremen. By this point, German soldiers without valid leave papers were being shot as deserters, so Trautmann sought to avoid troops from either side. However, a few days later, he was captured in a barn by two American soldiers. Deciding that Trautmann had no useful intelligence to give them, the soldiers marched him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> with his hands raised. Fearing he was about to be executed, Trautmann fled. After evading his captors, he jumped over a fence, only to land at the feet of a British soldier, who greeted him with the words [...] "Hello Fritz, fancy a cup of tea?" [...] Earlier in the war, he had been captured by the Russians and later the French Resistance, but escaped both times. With the war drawing to a close, Trautmann did not attempt a third escape.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the show's {{third season}} finale, [...] "There's No Place Like Home", Emma Swan (Snow White and Prince Charming's daughter) and Captain Hook accidentally bring back an urn from Rumplestiltskin's vault after their {{excursion}} into the past. The urn releases a blue liquid that coalesces into Elsa. She takes off her glove and destroys the urn with an icy blast. She strides <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn,</b> leaving a trail of frozen ground. In the fourth-season premiere, [...] "A Tale of Two Sisters," [...] Elsa's story is shown in the present day as well as flashbacks taking place two years after the events of the film. In the past, she discovers that her and Anna's parents set off not on a diplomatic mission, but on a journey to Misthaven—the [...] "Enchanted Forest" [...] where most of Storybrooke's fairy-tale residents came from—to discover more about Elsa's powers, with Anna's travelling to Misthaven {{to find out more about}} her parents' voyage. In the present, Elsa is frightened by her sudden exposure into the town of modern-day Storybrooke and re-conjures Marshmallow for protection. Marshmallow is defeated by Regina Mills (the Evil Queen), while Elsa discovers a necklace she gave long ago to Anna in Mr. Gold's (Rumplestiltskin's) shop, leaving her resolved to learn what happened to her sister.|$|E
25|$|When the Great Chicago Fire {{broke out}} on October 8, 1871, news of this, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> worst conflagrations in U.S. history to ever strike an American city, reached company {{officials}} Henry Willing and Levi Leiter, {{who decided to}} load as much of their expensive merchandise as possible onto wagons {{and take it to}} Leiter’s home, which was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> path <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire. The Company’s drivers and teams were ordered <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barns.</b> Horace B. Parker, a young salesman, rushed to the store’s basement, broke up boxes, and built a fire in the furnace boiler so that the steam-powered elevators could be operated. These employees worked feverishly through the night to remove vital records and valuable goods to safety.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> story <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Barn</b> Church at Kew {{inspired}} the building, in 1930, of St Alban's, Cheam, constructed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old <b>barns</b> and materials of Cheam Court Farm, {{which may have}} been connected with Nonsuch Palace. Edward Swan, <b>the</b> <b>Barn</b> Church's architect, was also commissioned [...] as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> architects for the project.|$|R
25|$|<b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extant <b>barns</b> in Stephenson County {{that have}} been listed on <b>the</b> National Register <b>of</b> Historic Places <b>the</b> Harbach Round <b>Barn</b> is <b>the</b> most altered from its {{original}} state.

The animal entrance, in <b>the</b> southeast quadrant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn,</b> has also been sealed since the building is primarily used for storage.|$|R

5000|$|The {{graveyard}} {{was always}} an attraction for energetic young people, and in 1917, The Sunday Times Advertiser printed <b>the</b> reminiscences <b>of</b> Howell Quigley, who remembered being one of a gang of Third Ward boys, the [...] "turn-cap-follow-me clique," [...] who, [...] "on their run through the neighborhood, across the fences and yards" [...] would disturb <b>the</b> sanctity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Quaker Church lot...even climbing onto <b>the</b> roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building, in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barns,</b> over <b>the</b> sheds, into cellars, anywhere, everywhere, and, oh, <b>the</b> dare <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaders."

50|$|The posse throws all {{the bodies}} inside <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> and {{barricade}} it shut. They {{set it on}} fire burning the remaining few zombies inside.

5|$|Following <b>the</b> {{publication}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cornerstone article, English Heritage {{stepped in}} to begin legal proceedings {{that would lead to}} <b>the</b> compulsory purchase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn.</b> It carried <b>out</b> emergency repairs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> in November 2009, without the owners' consent, under an Urgent Works Notice. The agency carried out an unusual legal manoeuvre to speed up the works, declassifying <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> from a scheduled monument to a Grade I listed building. This enabled the notice to be issued more speedily, overriding the owners' objections.|$|R
500|$|The {{following}} morning, <b>the</b> colt came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race tired but in good shape.

[...] "I wanted to share him with everybody and show everybody how kind and sweet he is," [...] said Baffert, while <b>the</b> group <b>of</b> about 30 people touched and even kissed the horse.

50|$|Soon after Charles Lindbergh's famous solo transatlantic {{flight in}} 1927, a craze {{for all things}} {{aeronautical}} swept over America. Guillow capitalized on that fad by introducing a line of balsa wood model kits. <b>The</b> first line <b>of</b> Guillow balsa shelf model kits offered consisted of twelve different World War I biplane fighters with 6 inch wing spans that retailed for 10¢ each. Each kit contained a 3-view plan, balsa wood cement, 2 bottles of colored dope, a strip of bamboo for wing and landing gear struts - this was considered relatively good value for such toys at that time. In 1933, demand for the kits were high enough as to enable Guillow to move <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family <b>barn</b> that it started from and into its present-day location in Wakefield. The company also supplemented <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> model airplanes with <b>the</b> publication <b>of</b> several books on flying model planes in the 1940s.|$|R
5000|$|The {{central figure}} is the muscular, shirtless [...] "Hercules" [...] {{grappling}} with <b>the</b> horns <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bull.

The bull's tail points into the surging, wavelike woods that rise <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distance; a <b>barn</b> and silo emerge from the woods to the right. <b>The</b> undulating line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rope and tail visually connect the woodlands and the timber produced from it.|$|R

60|$|Now {{if there}} was one thing Shadrach Mellick loved, it was money, and at the mention of pay he was all attention. He asked a few questions, and then led the way <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> and towards his house. The dogs wanted to follow, but he drove them back.|$|E

"Now, you {{are just}} as foolish as your master," [...] Gladys said with a hearty laugh; but she allowed the dog to slip down from her arms, and as he sought safety behind his master, she unloosened the chain from the cow's neck, leading her by the horn <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn.</b>|$|E
50|$|Suddenly, Asian mobsters attack <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> {{to avenge}} a fellow gangster's death at <b>the</b> hands <b>of</b> Ted and Officer Brazier (the same murder that Dale witnessed).

Dale and Saul join {{the fight and}} a brawl ensues between Dale and Ted. When Budlofsky refuses to kill Saul, Matheson emerges from the lair and shoots him in the chest, killing him. He turns around to kill Saul but Red drives through <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> and saves Saul by hitting Matheson with his car. Red is then seemingly {{shot to death by}} Brazier. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mobsters activates a bomb, resulting in Ted's death, and setting fire to <b>the</b> <b>barn.</b> When Red's car explodes, it flips over and lands on Brazier, killing her. The explosion incapacitates Saul but Dale finds him and carries him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> burning <b>barn.</b> Red, wounded but still alive, also escapes and reconciles with them. Afterwards they eat breakfast at a diner and talk about their adventure before Saul's grandmother picks them up and takes them to the hospital.|$|R
500|$|Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine felt Diorama [...] "was a shockingly {{creative}} and impressive step forward {{that showed the}} band shedding its grunge past and adding horns, strings, and mature lyrics to its arsenal." [...] Fellow Allmusic reviewer Bradley Torreano noted that [...] "they somehow kept going and kept improving ... Silverchair has grown up and put together a fine mix of orchestral pop and rock on Diorama." [...] Bernard Zuel described how the Diorama concert tour marked a move from hard rock towards art rock: [...] "they stepped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arenas and <b>barns</b> and 'got classy' ... finally having admitted to harbouring artistic ambition (a very un-Australian band thing to do), they've proved they have the ability".|$|R
50|$|Farmer's launch is {{delayed by}} endless red tape created by U.S. {{government}} {{officials from the}} FAA, FBI, CIA, NASA and <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> Defense, who seek to stall him beyond his deadline and force his creditors to foreclose on the farm. Farmer was counting on publicity to help him financially. He is denied the hydrazine fuel he requires, with government officials claiming he is a security risk {{and that it is}} too dangerous to allow a private citizen to launch a space vehicle. Facing financial ruin, he panics, climbs aboard, and, using a less-than-optimal substitute fuel, he somehow launches the rocket. However, after only a foot or two <b>of</b> vertical lift, <b>the</b> rocket descends back down, falls over, and horizontally blasts <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old wooden <b>barn</b> where it was constructed.|$|R
