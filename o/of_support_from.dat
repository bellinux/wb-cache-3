5|$|A letter <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> 120 {{members of}} the German parliament, the Bundestag, {{was sent to the}} Russian Ambassador to Germany, Vladimir Grinin. It {{described}} proceedings against the women as disproportionate and draconian. On August 9, 2012, 200 Pussy Riot supporters in Berlin marched, wearing colored balaclavas, in a show of support for the group. Attending the trial, British MP and Shadow Foreign Office Minister for Human Rights, Kerry McCarthy, also backed the group, describing proceedings as “surreal”. Lech Wałęsa criticised the church performance as “tasteless”, but nevertheless wrote to Putin urging him to pardon the women.|$|E
5|$|Another project {{combining}} the T-34 tank chassis with the D-15 gun was also considered. Designated SU-D15, the medium assault gun {{was intended as}} a replacement for the SU-122. Although the project received a lot <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> the authorities it never entered production, both because of its shortcomings (the heavy gun put too much strain on the suspension and ammunition stowage was too limited) and because it was made redundant by the ISU-152. However lessons learned mounting a powerful gun in the T-34 allowed for rapid development of the SU-100 tank destroyer.|$|E

5|$|By June, {{the band}} had {{performed}} another Italian tour (the third that year) {{and wanted to}} start recording new material (some of which ended up on Hammill's 1973 solo album Chameleon in the Shadow of the Night). However, the combination of working for too long without a break, combined with a lack <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> Stratton-Smith and Charisma and continued financial difficulties caused the band to implode, and Hammill left to pursue a solo career in mid-1972.|$|E
5|$|GreenSky London, a {{biofuels}} plant {{under construction}} in 2014, aimed to take in some 500,000 tonnes of municipal rubbish and change the organic component into 60,000 tonnes of jet fuel, and 40 megawatts of power. By the end of 2015, it was hoped all British Airways flights from London City Airport will be fuelled by waste and rubbish discarded by London residents, leading to carbon savings equivalent to taking 150,000 cars off the road. Unfortunately, the £340m scheme was mothballed in January 2016 following low crude oil prices, jittery investors and a lack <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> the UK government.|$|E

In external politics, Báthory was considering another war with Russia, but his plans were delayed to the lack <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> the Sejm, which refused to pass requested tax raises.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 Hamilton {{switched}} to the Swiss team, Phonak, citing lack <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> Riis.

In the 2004 Tour de France, Team CSC had a very successful Tour, with Basso winning a mountain stage and reaching the podium in Paris with his third place finish. Bjarn Riis and Team CSCs efforts in the 2004 Tour were made into the cycling movie Overcoming.|$|E
5|$|In a December 2015 interview, Tinkov {{announced}} that he would sell the team {{at the end of the}} 2016 season, citing on the one hand a business decision to redirect Tinkoff Bank's marketing budget from sports sponsorship to TV advertising from 2017, and on the other a lack <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> other teams from his proposed reforms to the sport's business model.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} of vicarious traumatization (VT), secondary traumatic stress (STS) and burnout to perceived level <b>of</b> social <b>support</b> {{and a personal}} history of traumatic events was examined among child welfare workers (N= 127). In addition, the relationship between child welfare worker 2 ̆ 7 s level <b>of</b> perceived social <b>support</b> and intention to remain employed at their current jobs was addressed. As hypothesized, perceived level <b>of</b> social <b>support</b> <b>from</b> friends, family, significant others, and supervisors was significantly correlated with levels of VT, STS, and burnout. Level <b>of</b> perceived social <b>support</b> <b>from</b> colleagues was negatively correlated with burnout. Level <b>of</b> perceived <b>support</b> <b>from</b> supervisors and colleagues was negatively correlated with intention to remain employed; however, contrary to the hypothesis, level <b>of</b> perceived social <b>support</b> <b>from</b> friends, family, and significant others was not significantly related to intention to remain employed. Last, histories of personal traumatic events were positively related to levels of VT, but not with STS or burnout. Applications of these results are addressed...|$|R

Stennis was so embarrassed by the hearings that he proposed a $10 million emergency fund be established for food and medical services. Despite resistance from other Southern legislators and a lack <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> President Johnson, Stennis' bill passed. The Senate also voted unanimously to create a Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs. The Poverty Subcommittee held further field hearings across the country {{as part of its}} work.|$|E

5|$|According to Ellsworth P. Bertholf's biographer C. Douglas Kroll, {{the first}} {{evidence}} of a form of football at the United States Naval Academy came in 1857, but the school's cadets lost interest in the game shortly afterward. The Naval Academy's first ever football team was fielded in 1879. The squad was entirely student-operated, receiving no official support from Naval Academy officials. The team was entirely funded by its members and their fellow students. The 1879 team participated in just one game, {{which resulted in a}} scoreless tie. It was played against the Baltimore Athletic Club, apparently on the Academy superintendent's cow pasture. Navy would not field a football team in 1880 or 1881, due to the lack <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> officials. When football returned to the academy in 1882, the squad was led by player-coach Vaulx Carter, and won 8–0 in a match with Johns Hopkins, starting a seven-year rivalry between the schools. The 1883 season resulted in Navy's first ever loss, a 2–0 defeat by Johns Hopkins. Navy returned the favor the following year, defeating Hopkins in a close 9–6 game.|$|E
5|$|After {{the liberation}} of France, Clouzot and several other {{directors}} were tried in court for collaborating with the Germans. For his sentence, Clouzot was forbidden from going on set of any film or from using a film camera {{for the rest of}} his life. Clouzot received letters <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> filmmakers and artists Jean Cocteau, René Clair, Marcel Carné and Jean-Paul Sartre, who were against the ruling. Clouzot's sentence was later shortened from life to two years. There is no official document making note of any apology or appeal. During his two-year banishment from filming, Clouzot worked with one of his supporters, Jean-Paul Sartre, who had been one of the first people to defend Le Corbeau.|$|E
5|$|Alan Eagleson was not repentant for {{his actions}} during game eight. Eagleson {{was not the only}} one jostled by police; Eagleson's wife and the Canadian ambassador's wife were also jostled.

He did get a letter <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> Robert Ford, the ambassador, who basically agreed with Eagleson's actions. Mail and messages about the incident was mostly in favour of Eagleson. According to Ted Blackman, Canadian fans were basically understanding of Team Canada's actions as being provoked while the team was under duress.|$|E

5|$|All of BA's Concorde fleet {{have been}} grounded, drained of {{hydraulic}} fluid and their airworthiness certificates withdrawn. Jock Lowe, ex-chief Concorde pilot {{and manager of}} the fleet estimated in 2004 that it would cost £10–15million to make G-BOAF airworthy again. BA maintain ownership and have stated {{that they will not}} fly again due to a lack <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> Airbus. On 1 December 2003, Bonhams held an auction of British Airways Concorde artefacts, including a nose cone, at Kensington Olympia in London. Proceeds of around £750,000 were raised, with the majority going to charity. G-BOAD is currently on display at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York. In 2007, BA announced that the advertising spot at Heathrow where a 40% scale model of Concorde was located would not be retained; the model is now on display at the Brooklands Museum, in Surrey, England.|$|E
5|$|Although the Paris Peace Accords of 1973 were {{supposed}} {{to end the war}} in Vietnam, fighting continued between South Vietnam and North Vietnam and the Viet Cong. Despite a pledge <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> U.S. President Richard Nixon, military aid to South Vietnam was sharply reduced. By the end of 1972 the Republic of Vietnam Air Force was the fourth largest air force in the world, with 2,075 aircraft and over 61,000 personnel. However, Republic of Vietnam Air Force operations were severely affected by cutbacks in military aid, flying hours had to be reduced by 51% and bomb loads on fighter aircraft halved from four to two pieces of ordnance.|$|E
5|$|An intense {{propaganda}} campaign led by partisans of John ensued. One of {{the leaders}} of the campaign against Longchamp was Hugh Nonant, the Bishop of Coventry, and he along with other magnates, including Geoffrey, who had been released, convened a trial on 5October 1191 at Loddon Bridge near London. Longchamp did not attend, but he was deposed and excommunicated, and after trying to hold the Tower of London, he was forced to surrender due to lack <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> the citizens of London. The council then declared his offices forfeit, and ordered the surrender of the castles in his custody. The main charge against Longchamp appears to have been his autocratic behaviour.|$|E

40|$|Guided by the Self-Determination Theory we {{examined}} {{in what way}} school engagement of young adolescents, who were at risk for school failure, was supported by primary social actors that fulfilled students’ basic intrinsic needs {{at home and at}} school. Students’ self-perceptions <b>of</b> social <b>support</b> <b>from</b> their mother, favourite teacher, and best friend were measured. As relationships with non-parental adults and peers become more meaningful in the developmental transition from late childhood to early adolescence (Furman & Buhrmester, 1992; Gaertner, Fite, & Colder, 2010), {{we examined}} whether social <b>support</b> <b>from</b> students’ favourite teacher and best friend could compensate for relatively low social <b>support</b> <b>from</b> their mother. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) with Bayesian estimators revealed that, as predicted, students’ best friend seemed of great importance to at-risk students’ behavioural school engagement.
