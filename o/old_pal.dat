Eliot claimed: [...] "Among [...] {{small number of}} music-hall performers, whose names are familiar to {{what is called the}} lower class, Marie Lloyd had far the strongest hold on popular affection." [...] Her biographer and friend MacQueen-Pope thought that Lloyd was [...] "going downhill of her own volition. The complaint was incurable, some might call it heartbreak, perhaps a less sentimental diagnosis is disillusionment." [...] The impersonator Charles Austin paid tribute by saying [...] "I have lost an <b>old</b> <b>pal,</b> and the public has lost its principal stage favourite, one who can never be replaced." ...|$|E
500|$|After Rothbard's {{death in}} 1995 Lew Rockwell, President of the von Mises Institute, told The New York Times that Rothbard was [...] "the founder of right-wing anarchism". William F. Buckley, Jr. wrote a {{critical}} obituary in the National Review criticizing Rothbard's [...] "defective judgment" [...] and {{views on the}} Cold War. The Ludwig von Mises Institute published Murray N. Rothbard, In Memoriam which included memorials from 31 individuals, including libertarians and academics. Journalist Brian Doherty summarizes Buckley's obituary as follows: [...] "when Rothbard died in 1995, his <b>old</b> <b>pal</b> William Buckley took pen in hand to piss on his grave." [...] Hoppe, Rockwell and Rothbard's colleagues at the Mises Institute took a different view, arguing {{that he was one}} of the most important philosophers in history.|$|E
500|$|DreamWorks {{announced}} Burton's {{appointment in}} August 2006, and Johnny Depp was cast as Todd. Christopher Lee, Peter Bowles, Anthony Head, {{and five other}} actors were set to play the ghost narrators, but their roles were cut (Head does appear in an uncredited cameo as a gentleman who congratulates Depp after the shaving contest). According to Lee, these deletions were due to time constraints caused by a break in filming during March 2007, while Depp's daughter recovered from an illness. Burton's domestic partner Helena Bonham Carter was cast in October 2006, as well as Sacha Baron Cohen. In December 2006, Alan Rickman was cast. In January 2007, Laura Michelle Kelly was cast as Lucy Barker. Timothy Spall {{was added to the}} cast, and said he was urged to audition by his daughter, who wanted him to work with Depp. He recalled, [...] "I really wanted this one – I knew Tim was directing and that Johnny Depp {{was going to be in}} it. My daughter, my youngest daughter, really wanted me to do it for that reason – Johnny Depp was in it. (She came on set to meet Depp) and he was really delightful to her, she had a great time. Then, I took her to the junket – and (Depp) greeted her like an <b>old</b> <b>pal</b> when he saw her. I've got plenty of brownie points at the moment." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{electrocardiograph}} (ECG or EKG) machine used in {{the show}} was a Datascope Model 850 Dual Trace Physiological Monitor. This model came out in 1971 {{and was the first}} portable, battery rechargeable unit of its kind. Its original price was $2,000.

2500|$|By the mid-1920s, Yale {{was noted}} {{as one of}} the most {{powerful}} gangsters in Brooklyn. In addition to his numerous rackets, Yale made inroads into labor racketeering and dockside extortion as well. In spring of 1927, however, Yale's long friendship with Capone began to fray. As a major importer of Canadian whisky, Yale supplied much of Capone's whiskey. Yale would oversee the landing of the booze and make sure the Chicago-bound trucks made it safely through New York. Soon, many of the trucks began being hijacked before they left Brooklyn. Suspecting a double cross, Capone asked an <b>old</b> <b>pal</b> James [...] "Filesy" [...] DeAmato to keep an eye on his trucks. DeAmato reported that Yale was indeed hijacking his booze. Soon after this, Capone's spy realized that his cover had been blown and tried unsuccessfully to shoot Yale on the night of July 1, 1927. Six nights later, DeAmato was gunned down on a Brooklyn street corner.|$|E
