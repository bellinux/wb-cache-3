5|$|In {{spite of}} the few major operations, {{the first decade of}} the boom was {{dominated}} by numerous small producers. As production expanded and new companies were formed, consolidation occurred. By the late 1920s, ten companies produced more than half of the oil in the state: Gulf Production Company, Humble Oil and Refining Company, Southern Crude Oil Purchasing Company (later absorbed by Amoco which was later absorbed by BP), the Texas Company, Shell Petroleum Corporation, Yount-Lee <b>Oil</b> <b>Company,</b> Magnolia Petroleum Company, J.

5|$|In 1934, the Kuwait <b>Oil</b> <b>Company</b> (KOC) {{was formed}} as a joint venture by British Petroleum and Gulf. Both British Petroleum and Gulf held equal shares in the venture. KOC pioneered the {{exploration}} for oil in Kuwait during the late 1930s. Oil was discovered at Burgan in 1938 {{but it was not}} until 1946 that the first crude oil was shipped. Oil production started from Rawdhatain in 1955 and Minagish in 1959. KOC started gas production in 1964. It was the cheap oil and gas being shipped from Kuwait that formed the economic basis for Gulf's diverse petroleum sector operations in Europe, the Mediterranean, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent. These last operations were coordinated by Gulf <b>Oil</b> <b>Company,</b> Eastern Hemisphere Ltd (GOCEH) from their offices at 2 Portman Street in London W1.|$|E

5|$|Standard Oil {{initially}} {{chose not}} to become directly involved in oil production in Texas, and instead formed Security <b>Oil</b> <b>Company</b> as a refining operation utilizing Guffey-Gulf and Texas Company as suppliers. Following state lawsuits related to anti-trust statutes, Security Oil was reorganized into Magnolia Petroleum Company in 1911. That same year, the Humble <b>Oil</b> <b>Company</b> (today Exxon Corporation) was formed by Ross Sterling and Walter William Fondren in Humble, Texas. The headquarters were moved to Houston, and the company eventually sold half of its shares to Standard Oil of New Jersey, establishing a long-term partnership that lasted for decades. The company built the Baytown Refinery, which became Texas' largest refining operation. In the post-World War II period, Humble became the largest crude oil transporter in the United States, and built pipelines connecting Baytown to Dallas-Fort Worth and West Texas to the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The Bahrain Petroleum Company (Bapco), a {{subsidiary}} of the Standard <b>Oil</b> <b>Company</b> of California (Socal), discovered oil in 1931 and production began the following year. This was to bring rapid modernisation to Bahrain. Relations with the United Kingdom became closer, as evidenced by the British Royal Navy moving its entire Middle Eastern command from Bushehr in Iran to Bahrain in 1935.|$|E

5|$|During the 1930s, a Dallas company {{known as}} the General American Finance System, {{struggling}} through the Great Depression, began to finance drilling operations in the state using oil reserves as collateral. This allowed Dallas to establish itself as the financing center for the oil industry. The Great American Finance System eventually reorganized itself as the General American <b>Oil</b> <b>Company</b> of Texas, which became an oil producer {{in its own right}} and, decades later, was purchased by Phillips Petroleum.|$|E
5|$|For all its success, by the 1920s Argentina {{was not an}} industrialized {{country by}} the {{standards}} of Britain, Germany or the United States. A major hindrance to full industrialisation was the lack of energy sources such as coal or hydropower. Experiments with oil, discovered in 1907, had poor results. Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales, the first state-owned <b>oil</b> <b>company</b> in Latin America, was founded in 1922 as a public company responsible for 51% of the oil production; the remaining 49% was in private hands.|$|E

Do the shares of <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> of emerging markets react to the price news in a similar way as those of the Western companies? This paper aims to answer these questions utilising various event study techniques. As expected, the results of both parametric and non-parametric tests suggest that the fluctuations of oil price {{have an effect on}} the stock prices. However, an interesting result is that the responses of stocks of Chinese and Russian <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> are considerably different from the shares of their Western counterparts.

In 1943, the country increased the total royalties and tax paid by the companies to 50% of their total profits. However, true equal profit sharing was not accomplished until 1948. Because <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> were able to deduct the tax from their income tax, profits acquired by the <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> did not change significantly and, as a result, the <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> {{did not have any}} major problems with the change imposed by Venezuela.

40|$|As the oil {{industry}} in Kenya continues to grow, increased pressure is being placed on these companies to contribute in Corporate Social activities. The concept of CSR in the Kenyan <b>Oil</b> <b>companies</b> has been a topic of great interest. These <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> have however {{been found to have}} a narrow perspective of what CSR entails as they do not identify all their stakeholders in their efforts to be socially responsible. <b>Oil</b> <b>companies</b> in Kenya also have various reasons as to why they come up with CSR activities. These factors range from the fact that <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> want to comply with government policies {{to the fact that the}} companies want to be ethical. <b>Oil</b> <b>companies</b> contribute to their CSR efforts by engaging in activities that are geared to both their employees and to the community. To their employees these companies have set up health benefit schemes and have ensured safe working conditions, while to the community these companies have involved themselves in community projects that are geared towards any needy society. In their quest to engage in CSR activities, these companies have also been faced with various challenges. Some of the biggest challenges identified are the lack of resources by these companies to be able to effectively engage in CSR activities and the lack of support from the other stakeholders to assist the <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> to meet their CSR targets. <b>Oil</b> <b>companies</b> have however come up with different ways to counteract these challenges. <b>Oil</b> <b>companies</b> are now working in conjunction with other organizations that have a direct impact to the society e. g.
