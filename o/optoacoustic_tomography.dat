50|$|Multi-spectral <b>optoacoustic</b> <b>tomography</b> (MSOT) is an imaging {{technology}} that generates high-resolution optical images in scattering media, including biological tissues. MSOT illuminates tissue with light of transient energy, typically light pulses lasting 1-100 nanoseconds. The tissue absorbs the light pulses, {{and as a}} result undergoes thermo-elastic expansion, a phenomenon known as the optoacoustic or photoacoustic effect. This expansion gives rise to ultrasound waves (photoechoes) that are detected and formed into an image. Image formation can be done by means of hardware (e.g. acoustic focusing or optical focusing) or computed tomography (mathematical image formation). Unlike other types of optoacoustic imaging, MSOT involves illuminating the sample with multiple wavelengths, allowing it to detect ultrasound waves emitted by different photoabsorbing molecules in the tissue, whether endogenous (oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, melanin) or exogenous (imaging probes, nanoparticles). Computational techniques such as spectral unmixing deconvolute the ultrasound waves emitted by these different absorbers, allowing each emitter to be visualized separately in the target tissue. In this way, MSOT can allow visualization of hemoglobin concentration and tissue oxygenation or hypoxia. Unlike other optical imaging methods, MSOT is unaffected by photon scattering and thus can provide high-resolution optical images deep inside biological tissues.|$|E

We describe {{the development and}} characterization of a laser OA imaging system for the prostate (LOIS-P). The system consists of a fiber-coupled Q-switched laser operating at 757 nm, a commercial 128 -channel ultrasonic probe, a digital signal processor, and software that uses the filtered radial back-projection algorithm for image reconstruction. The system is used to reconstruct OA images of a blood-rich lesion induced in vivo in a canine prostate. OA images obtained in vivo are compared to images acquired using ultrasound, the current gold standard for guiding biopsy of the prostate. Although key structural features such as the urethra could be identified with both imaging techniques, a bloody lesion representing a highly vascularized tumor could only be clearly identified in OA images. The advantages and limitations of both forward and backward illumination modes are also evaluated by collecting OA images of phantoms simulating blood vessels within tissue. System resolution {{is estimated to be}} 0. 2 mm in the radial direction of the acoustic array. The minimum detectable pressure signal is 1. 83 Pa. Our results encourage further development toward a dual-modality OA∕ultrasonic system for prostate imaging and image-guided biopsy...|$|R

Procedures: Nude mice were stereotactically implanted with near-infrared FP expressing glioma cells to from brain tumors. The feasibility and performance metrics of FPs were compared between planar epi-illumination and trans-illumination fluorescence imaging, as well as to hybrid Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT) system combined with X-ray CT and Multispectral <b>Optoacoustic</b> (or Photoacoustic) <b>Tomography</b> (MSOT).

Spectral unmixing algorithms are used to decompose multi-spectral optoacoustic data into a set of images representing distribution of each individual chromophoric component while the particular algorithm employed determines the sensitivity and speed of data visualization. Here we suggest using vertex component analysis (VCA), a method with demonstrated good performance in hyperspectral imaging, as a fast blind unmixing algorithm for multispectral <b>optoacoustic</b> <b>tomography.</b> The performance of the method is subsequently compared with a previously reported blind unmixing procedure in <b>optoacoustic</b> <b>tomography</b> based {{on a combination of}} principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA).

The performance of this approach is also analysed in numerical simulations and experimental measurements.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Optoacoustic</b> <b>tomography</b> enables {{volumetric}} imaging with optical contrast in biological tissue at depths be-yond the optical {{mean free path}} {{by the use of}} optical excitation and acoustic detection. The hybrid nature of <b>optoacoustic</b> <b>tomography</b> gives rise to two distinct inverse problems: The optical inverse problem, related to the propagation of the ex-citation light in tissue, and the acoustic inverse problem, which deals with the propagation and detection of the generated acoustic waves. Since the two inverse problems have different physical underpinnings and are governed by different types of equations, they are often treated independently as unrelated problems. From an imaging standpoint, the acoustic inverse problem relates to forming an image from the measured acoustic data, whereas the optical inverse problem relates to quantifying the formed image. This review focuses on the acoustic aspects of <b>optoacoustic</b> <b>tomography,</b> specifically acoustic reconstruction algorithms and imaging-system practicalities. As these two aspects are intimately linked, and no silver bullet exists in the path towards high-performance imaging, we adopt a holistic approach in our review and discuss the many links between the two aspects. Four classes of reconstruction algorithms are reviewed: time-domain (so called back-projection) formulae, frequency-domain formulae, time-reversal algorithms, and model-based algorithms. These al-gorithms are discussed {{in the context of the}} various acoustic detectors and detection surfaces which are commonly used in experimental studies.

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: Optoacoustic imaging {{relies on}} the {{detection}} of ultrasonic waves induced by laser pulse excitations to map optical absorption in biological tissue. A tomographic geometry employing a conventional ultrasound linear detector array for volumetric optoacoustic imaging is reported. The geometry {{is based on a}} translate-rotate scanning motion of the detector array, and capitalizes on the geometrical characteristics of the transducer assembly to provide a large solid angular detection aperture. A system for three-dimensional whole-body <b>optoacoustic</b> <b>tomography</b> of small animals is implemented. METHODS: The detection geometry was tested using a 128 -element linear array (5. 0 ∕ 7. 0 MHz, Acuson L 7, Siemens), moved by steps with a rotation∕translation stage assembly. Translation and rotation range of 13. 5 mm and 180 °, respectively, were implemented. Optoacoustic emissions were induced in tissue-mimicking phantoms and ex vivo mice using a pulsed laser operating in the near-IR spectral range at 760 nm. Volumetric images were formed using a filtered backprojection algorithm. RESULTS: The resolution of the <b>optoacoustic</b> <b>tomography</b> system was measured to be better than 130 μm in-plane and 330 μm in elevation (full width half maximum), and to be homogenous along a 15 mm diameter cross section due to the translate-rotate scanning geometry. Whole-body volumetric optoacoustic images of mice were performed ex vivo, and imaged organs and blood vessels through the intact abdominal and head regions were correlated to the mouse anatomy. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the feasibility of three-dimensional and high-resolution whole-body optoacoustic imaging of small animal using a conventional linear array was demonstrated.

40|$|Segmentation of {{biomedical}} {{images is}} essential for studying and characterizing anatomical structures, detection and evaluation of pathological tissues. Segmentation has been further shown to enhance the reconstruction performance in many tomographic imaging modalities by accounting for heterogeneities of the excitation field and tissue properties in the imaged region. This is particularly relevant in <b>optoacoustic</b> <b>tomography,</b> where discontinuities in the optical and acoustic tissue properties, if not properly accounted for, may result in deterioration of the imaging performance. Efficient segmentation of optoacoustic images is often hampered by the relatively low intrinsic contrast of large anatomical structures, which is further impaired by the limited angular coverage of some commonly employed tomographic imaging configurations. Herein, we analyze the performance of active contour models for boundary segmentation in cross-sectional <b>optoacoustic</b> <b>tomography.</b> The segmented mask is employed to construct a two compartment model for the acoustic and optical parameters of the imaged tissues, which is subsequently used to improve accuracy of the image reconstruction routines.
