Maria {{attempted}} to befriend her guards both at Tsarskoye Selo and Tobolsk and soon learned their names and details about their wives and children. Unaware of her danger, she commented at Tobolsk {{that she would be}} happy to live there indefinitely if <b>only</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> take a walk outside without being guarded continuously. Still, she was aware that she was being watched constantly. Maria and her sister Anastasia burned their letters and diaries in April 1918 because they feared their possessions would be searched.|$|E

Impressed with Alex da Kid's work, Eminem asked for more tracks and subsequently heard [...] "Love the Way You Lie". He chose it and told his manager Paul Rosenberg he wanted to collaborate with the Barbadian singer Rihanna. Eminem told Skyrock FM, [...] "It's one of those tracks that I felt like <b>only</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> pull it off."

Shortly after arriving, however, she developed a bad fever {{and was forced to}} depart the hospital and her husband to return to Europe for treatment. After recovering, she used her writing skills and began to edit her husband's autobiography. Her English skills also opened the door for [...] "public speaking and networking in the United States." [...] On December 1, 1930, a German newspaper printed one of her speeches. In it, she described her husband’s concept, the Fellowship of the Marks of Pain. She turned her medical challenges into positives, explaining that through her suffering she developed a compassionate view of their work that <b>only</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> personally attest.|$|E
500|$|Akane is the 20-year-old main female {{protagonist of}} Psycho-Pass. Akane is the newly {{assigned}} Inspector of Unit One of the Public Safety Bureau's Criminal Investigation Division. She passes the exams {{with the highest}} score for employment on several public sectors and private corporations. Of more than 500 students, Akane {{was the only one}} to get an [...] "A" [...] ranking for the Public Safety Bureau and decided to join it because she thought {{she would be able to}} accomplish something that <b>only</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do and find her purpose in life. She is initially uncomfortable with her job because it involved attacking and subduing potentially violent criminals before they can act. Enforcer Shinya Kogami's recognizes and is curious by Akane's views on these criminals. Akane befriends Kogami and Enforcer Tomomi Masaoka, which makes the veteran Inspector Nobuchika Ginozawith whom Akane often arguesangry. In one case, Akane's best friend is murdered by criminal mastermind Shogo Makishima. However, her acceptance of society and will to fight to against conflicts prevent her from becoming a latent criminal, despite the trauma of seeing her best friend's death. Akane then resolves to arrest Makishima.|$|E
500|$|She summoned {{church leaders}} {{from both sides}} to attempt to solve their doctrinal differences. Despite her optimism, the {{resulting}} Colloquy of Poissy ended in failure on 13 October 1561, dissolving itself without her permission. Catherine failed because she saw the religious divide only in political terms. In the words of historian R. J. Knecht, [...] "she underestimated the strength of religious conviction, imagining that all would be well if <b>only</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> get the party leaders to agree". In January 1562, Catherine issued the tolerant Edict of Saint-Germain in a further attempt to build bridges with the Protestants. On 1 March 1562, however, in an incident known as the Massacre of Vassy, the Duke of Guise and his men attacked worshipping Huguenots in a barn at Vassy (Wassy), killing 74 and wounding 104. Guise, who called the massacre [...] "a regrettable accident", was cheered as a hero {{in the streets of}} Paris while the Huguenots called for revenge. The massacre lit the fuse that sparked the French Wars of Religion. For the next thirty years, France found itself in a state of either civil war or armed truce.|$|E

500|$|Instead, Raucher {{decided to}} focus on the first major adult {{experience}} of his life, that of falling in love for the first time. The woman (named Dorothy, like her screen counterpart) was a fellow vacationer on the island whom the 14-year old Raucher had befriended one day when he helped her carry groceries home; he became a friend of her and her husband and helped her with chores after her husband was called to fight in World War II. On the night memorialized in the film, Raucher randomly came to visit her, unaware his arrival was just minutes after she received notification of her husband's death. She was confused and upset, had been drinking heavily, and repeatedly called Raucher by her husband's name. Although both ultimately [...] disrobed, contrary to popular opinion, sexual intercourse did not occur. Raucher admitted this in a 2002 interview saying it was mostly holding, but in the movie [...] "We let you think what you want." [...] The next morning, Raucher discovered that she had left the island, leaving behind a note for him (which is read {{at the end of the}} film and reproduced in the book). He never saw her again; his last [...] "encounter" [...] with her, recounted on an episode of The Mike Douglas Show, came after the film's release in 1971, when she was one of over a dozen women who wrote letters to Raucher claiming to be [...] "his" [...] Dorothy. Raucher recognized the [...] "real" [...] Dorothy's handwriting, and she confirmed her identity by making references to certain events <b>only</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have known about. She told Raucher that she had lived for years with the guilt that she had potentially traumatized him and ruined his life. She told Raucher that she was glad he turned out all right, and that they had best not re-visit the past.|$|E

As an associate of the Prince, he was sent to Mrs Fitzherbert to tell her that the Prince had attempted suicide and <b>only</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> save his life, and he guarded the door of Fitzherbert's house when she secretly married the prince. However, he later fell out with the Prince, for reasons unknown, voting in favour of Pitt's regency proposal of 1789 and against the abolition of the slave trade in 1796.|$|E

2500|$|In 1898 and 1899, Yaw {{was singing}} in private concerts in London, {{and at one}} of these, {{at the home of}} Mrs. Fanny Ronalds, Sir Arthur Sullivan heard her and {{arranged}} for her to be cast as the Sultana Zubedyah in his comic opera The Rose of Persia, which opened on November 29, 1899 at the Savoy Theatre in London. Sullivan wrote a special cadenza for her song [...] "'Neath My Lattice" [...] that was so high that <b>only</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> sing it. Yaw had difficulty in the role the first two nights of the production, though the reviews were mixed, and both the music director, Francois Cellier, and Mrs. Carte advocated for her replacement. Sullivan wrote in his diary on 2 December 1898, [...] "I told [...] I was afraid [...] would not improve, that she hadn’t got it in her", but noted, [...] "I don’t quite see what it’s all about – Miss Yaw is not keeping people out of the theatre as Cellier and the Cartes imply." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ilene Kristen was {{immediately}} praised for her portrayal of Delia. Ronni Ashcroft who praised Kristen for her portrayal said, [...] "it's a wonder she's {{able to pull}} off Delia's bitchiness so convincingly" [...] because the two were exact opposites of one another. Francine L. Trevens said, [...] "She plays Delia to perfection." [...] In 1978, Kristen won Afternoon TV Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Delia. Kristen also earned two Soap Opera Digest Award nominations for Outstanding Comic Performance in 1988, and for Outstanding Villainess in 1989. Kristen ranked at #21 on We Love Soaps list of the 50 Greatest Soap Actresses. Fans immediately took to Edwards in the role. John N. Goudas praised Edwards for her portrayal and said the actress made the character very multidimensional. Edwards' firing was met with skepticism from Lynda Hirsch who said that Edwards had become very popular in her own right. Because the actresses were so different, [...] "it's hard to imagine Delia reverting into the character that Ilene made her originally," [...] said Hirsch. Despite Edwards success in the role, Kristen believed that <b>only</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> capture the true essence of Delia. Seli Graves agreed with Kristen's assessment in 1988 and said the character [...] "resisted anyone else's efforts {{to bring out the}} unique qualities" [...] of Delia.|$|E
2500|$|Olivia is {{revealed}} {{to be linked to}} the drug Cortexiphan, a chemical developed by William Bell, which supposedly allows children injected with it to retain higher brain functions which would normally deteriorate with age. Olivia was {{one of a group of}} preschool-age children who served as subjects of the experiment in her childhood home of Jacksonville, Florida. [...] As a result, Olivia is capable of unspecified psychic abilities, as demonstrated when she shuts off a series of lights wired into a bomb as a kill switch simply by thinking it. Walter has a video of Olivia as a child, ostensibly recorded during the drug trials, which shows her curled up in the corner of the room next to a badly charred bed with Walter saying: [...] "It's all right, you didn't mean it." [...] We later learn that Olivia started the fire with her mind. Olivia also had the ability to discern if an object originated in the alternate dimension due to a [...] "glimmer" [...] that <b>only</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see. When trying to reawaken this ability in her as an adult, Dr. Bishop hypothesized that this ability was partially derived from Olivia's fear about seeing into the alternate dimension. [...] When Olivia regains part of her memories of her meeting with Bell, she is told that she is the only successful subject suitable to pass through dimensions without many known negative side-effects. She has been called the guardian of the gateway by Bell, who will prevent the invasion by the alternate dimension.|$|E

2500|$|Chosen by Empress Dowager Cixi on her deathbed, Puyi became emperor {{at the age}} of 2years and 10months in December1908 {{after the}} Guangxu Emperor died on 14November. Titled the Xuantong Emperor (Wade-Giles: Hsuan-tung Emperor), Puyi's {{introduction}} to the life of an emperor began when palace officials arrived at his family residence to take him. On the evening of 13November 1908, without any advance notice, a procession of eunuchs and guardsmen led by the palace chamberlain left the Forbidden City for the Northern Mansion to inform Prince Chun that they were taking away his three-year-old son Puyi to be the new emperor. The toddler Puyi screamed and resisted as the officials ordered the eunuch attendants to pick him up. Puyi's parents said nothing when they learned that they were losing their son. As Puyi cried, screaming {{that he did not want}} to leave his parents, he was forced into a palanquin that took him back to the Forbidden City. Puyi's wet nurse Wang Wen-Chao was the only person from the Northern Mansion allowed to go with him, and she calmed the very distraught Puyi down by allowing him to suckle one of her breasts; this was the only reason why she was taken along as <b>only</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> calm Puyi down. Upon arriving at the Forbidden City, Puyi was taken to see the Dowager Empress Cixi. Puyi later wrote: I still have a dim recollection of this meeting, the shock of which left a deep impression on my memory. I remember suddenly finding myself surrounded by strangers, while before me was hung a drab curtain through which I could see an emaciated and terrifying hideous face. This was Cixi. It is said that I burst out into loud howls at the sight and started to tremble uncontrollably. Cixi told someone to give me some sweets, but I threw them on the floor and yelled [...] "I want nanny, I want nanny", to her great displeasure. [...] "What a naughty child" [...] she said. [...] "Take him away to play." [...] His father, Prince Chun, became Prince Regent (摄政王). During Puyi's coronation in the Hall of Supreme Harmony on 2December 1908, the young emperor was carried onto the Dragon Throne by his father. Puyi was so frightened by the scene before him and the deafening sounds of ceremonial drums and music that he started crying. His father could do nothing except to quietly comfort him: [...] "Don't cry, it'll be over soon." ...|$|E
