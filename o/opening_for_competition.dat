40|$|In this {{research}} I {{have used a}} sample that was to cover market - regulatory environment - firm performance permutations capturing the changes in competitive dynamics and the co-evolutionary paths the firms and their respective business environment have taken when the markets were opened for competition. The research process builds on Event Structure Analysis (ESA) {{as a means to}} create causal patterns in the interaction between the firm and the environment. Data was collected from primary and secondary sources and complemented by confirmatory interviews. The electricity markets prior to <b>opening</b> <b>for</b> <b>competition</b> were either vertically integrated geographically monopoly markets or monopoly markets where the entry was constrained by other means. The value chain from generation to retail sales was rigid. There was either a position in which one company {{was in charge of the}} entire value chain, or the wholesale oligopolies had exclusivity on the sales to local monopoly distribution / retail firms. In most researched jurisdictions an oversupply of power prevailed at the time of the introduction of competition, which subsequently led to price cuts for some customers. During the process the focal point of activities shifted from being between the firm and the regulator / legislator to being between the firm and the customer. There was difference between the cases, but the fundamental shift seemed to follow the same basic pattern. The process ended in the key interaction taking place between the firm and the customer, with the regulator and legislator influence still being active. The regulative framework was not really designed for competitive markets but the existing structure had to be used to support another modification of the system. Key contribution of {{this research}} consists of the cyclical co-evolutionary interaction model that captures the interactions between the energy firm and its regulatory, legislative, customer and external interactions to a cohesive whole. The model is complemented by a set of propositions that define the key elements of this interaction. The model builds on the foundation laid by political economy, the theory of public choice and the Austrian economics...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a two-country model of wage determination with private information in unionized imperfectly competitive industries. We investigate {{the effects of}} separated product markets <b>opening</b> up <b>for</b> <b>competition</b> {{as well as of}} further market integration on the negociated wage and the maximum delay in reaching an agreement. From an initial situation of reciprocal intra-industry trade, an increase in product market integration will decrease the maximal delay in reaching an agreement. However, markets <b>opening</b> up <b>for</b> <b>competition</b> have an ambiguous effect on both the wage outcome and the maximum real delay time in reaching an agreement. economic integration; product market competition; wage bargaining; strike activity...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} spatial two-country model of wage {{determination}} with private information in unionized imperfectly competitive industries. We investigage {{the effects of}} separated product markets <b>opening</b> up <b>for</b> <b>competition</b> {{as well as of}} further market integration on the negotiated wage and the strike activity. We show that, when product markets are separated, the wage level and the strike activity are decreasing with the transportation cost and the home market size. However, when markets are integrated, wages and strikes are now increasing with the transportation cost. Finally, we find that the <b>opening</b> of markets <b>for</b> <b>competition</b> has an ambiguous impact on both the negotiated wage and the strike activity. economic integration;horizontal differentiation;product market competition;wage bargaining;strike activity...|$|R
5000|$|The {{paper was}} created {{at a time}} of a {{fundamental}} change in British newspaper publishing. Rupert Murdoch was challenging long-accepted practices of the print unions and ultimately defeated them in the Wapping dispute. Consequently, production costs could be reduced which, it was said at the time, created <b>openings</b> <b>for</b> more <b>competition.</b> As a result of controversy around Murdoch's move to Wapping, the plant was effectively having to function under siege from sacked print workers picketing outside. The Independent attracted some of the staff from the two Murdoch broadsheets who had chosen not to move to his company's new headquarters. Launched with the advertising slogan [...] "It is. Are you?", and challenging both The Guardian for centre-left readers and The Times as the newspaper of record, The Independent reached a circulation of over 400,000 by 1989.|$|R
50|$|Bit-stream {{access is}} {{nowadays}} considered a key tool <b>for</b> <b>opening</b> <b>competition</b> in the broadband market. It enables competitors {{to offer their}} own products to consumers {{even if they do}} not operate the local loop (the last mile). Bit-stream access allows the new entrant to use the high-speed modems and other equipment provided by the incumbent and thus avoid maintenance and investments into the local loop. This affects the economics of the service and places restrictions on the type of modems that the customer of the new entrant can buy or rent.|$|R
40|$|Technological and {{regulatory}} developments are <b>opening</b> the door <b>for</b> <b>competition</b> and new {{services in the}} local loop. The reunification of Germany created an opportunity for Deutsche Telekom to install fiber in the loop {{on a large scale}} in eastern Germany. Deutsche Telekom's strategy consists of four steps: (1) Fiber in the loop is seen as a process innovation. New broadband services - product innovations - can be based on the process innovation. (2) Only a sufficient number of installations will enable the industry to invest in new products. (3) Besides the local networks equipped with fiber, there is an overlay network for the rapid delivery of fiber access for business customers. (4) The experience gained in eastern Germany will be transferred to western Germany when transforming its existing network structure. ...|$|R

These reforms included a major overhaul of the unemployment insurance system and a complete renovation of the Public Employment Service, introducing new instructions, a new board of directors, a new management team, a new structure and organization, new targets and incentives, as well as <b>opening</b> up <b>for</b> private <b>competition.</b> He has the current record of having answered the highest number of questions in Parliament - 337 - during one single term.

40|$|In 1993 the {{internal}} market within the European Union was formed and ensured {{free movement of}} goods, services, capital and people. This led to the removal of trade barriers between members of the European Union. When <b>opening</b> up <b>for</b> <b>competition,</b> price differences between countries decreased and more jobs were created. A single currency was introduced by eleven countries in 1999 {{with the goal of}} reducing transaction costs, eliminating exchange rate risk and to further simplify trade. In 2001 Greece joined the collaboration and introduced the euro. With a single currency, price differences are expected to decrease. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate whether a common currency has had a significant effect on reducing price dispersion or not. Two types of convergence are tested, beta and sigma convergence. 21 different product groups are included in this study and are sorted after the speed of convergence. All of the 27 EU member states are included and divided into two groups, one euro group and one non-euro group. We also examine if differences in productivity can explain price convergence. The results indicate that the introduction of a common currency did not decrease price dispersion within the majority of product groups. For the product groups in which price convergence are evident, only one product group within the euro countries and one product group within the non-euro countries have proven to be significantly positive in terms of differences in productivity...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{tests the}} claim that {{national}} differences in sectoral state traditions diminish over time. The case study covers telephone policy debates in France and Germany in five time periods from 1876 until 1997 : the 'consolidation phase' (1876 - 1900); the 1920 s; the post-Second World War years; the debates leading up to corporatisation in the 1980 s; and the debates around <b>opening</b> <b>for</b> full <b>competition</b> in the 1990 s. The analytical framework is founded in writings on state traditions and {{on the role of}} ideas and discourse in policymaking. The study's object of investigation, 'sectoral state traditions', is developed to allow for comparison both longitudinally within one country and cross-nationally. It comprises the notion of authority and of who should be the relevant actors in the policy process; public ethos of sectoral policies; and criteria for legitimate decision-making procedures and discourse. Central concepts and ideas in public debates are identified in both countries for each period. The investigation of public political debates (parliamentary debates, governmental and other public documents, and newspaper articles) in each country shows that sectoral state traditions were highly resistant to change. Cross-national comparison further corroborates the persistence of the two sectoral state traditions, which, despite common external factors (technology, international cooperation, supranational legislation), showed little or no convergence. The set of actors perceived as relevant to policymaking remained largely stable throughout the period under investigation. The French ethos of "service public', and the German ethos of efficient infrastructure provision, remained central. Criteria for decision-making and discourse altered in France in the late 1980 s, whereas they remained stable in Germany. Evidence therefore does not support a hypothesis of convergence between the two sectoral state traditions...|$|R

50|$|After {{a recent}} {{insurance}} {{investigation of the}} pit out <b>opening</b> <b>for</b> the road course, which is located along the left lane wall of the drag strip, the insurance carrier has demanded the pit out be closed off with a permanent concrete wall. This effectively means closing the road course <b>for</b> <b>competition</b> purposes as well, {{as there is no}} other area on the current track layout suitable to relocate a viable pit lane. However, club racing has used a section of track that runs parallel to the backstretch of the oval (Turns 6-8) as a makeshift pit for club racing, although enough section of the return road for the drag strip could also be used if realigned.|$|R
