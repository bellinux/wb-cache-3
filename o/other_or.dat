5|$|Psychology is {{the science}} that investigates mental states directly. It uses {{generally}} empirical methods to investigate concrete mental states like joy, fear or obsessions. Psychology investigates {{the laws that}} bind these mental states to each <b>other</b> <b>or</b> with inputs and outputs to the human organism.|$|E

5|$|Sleep hygiene is {{a central}} {{component}} of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. Sleep hygiene recommendations {{have been shown to}} reduce or eliminate the symptoms of insomnia. Specific sleep disorders may require <b>other</b> <b>or</b> additional treatment approaches, and continuing difficulties with sleep may require additional assistance from healthcare providers.|$|E
5|$|The Villy gun casemates {{are close}} to Block 2, {{directly}} adjacent to the 1940 road. They replaced the planned 75mm gun turret block. The casemates are not connected to each <b>other</b> <b>or</b> to the main ouvrage, a weakness that influenced the 1940 combat action.|$|E
5|$|After Flower was {{released}} to critical praise and awards, Chen and Thatgamecompany {{moved on to}} their next game, Journey. Journey was intended by Chen {{to focus on the}} element of communication and social interaction in video games. Since in most games the communication between players is focused on specific goals, in Journey Chen intended for the player to be able to either play alone or to come across other players, but not be able to communicate with them directly. Instead, players have to build relationships with each other through their actions, helping each <b>other</b> <b>or</b> leaving as they choose. Journey {{was released}} on the PlayStation Network on March 13, 2012, and has received critical acclaim.|$|E

5|$|Alliteration is the {{repetition}} of letters or letter-sounds {{at the beginning of}} two or more words immediately succeeding each <b>other,</b> <b>or</b> at short intervals; or the recurrence of the same letter in accented parts of words. Alliteration and assonance {{played a key role in}} structuring early Germanic, Norse and Old English forms of poetry. The alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry interweave meter and alliteration as a key part of their structure, so that the metrical pattern determines when the listener expects instances of alliteration to occur. This can be compared to an ornamental use of alliteration in most Modern European poetry, where alliterative patterns are not formal or carried through full stanzas. Alliteration is particularly useful in languages with less rich rhyming structures.|$|E
5|$|Although still mainly bred in the Kathiawar peninsula, it is {{also found}} in the Maharashtra and Rajasthan states. The Kathiawari Horse Breeders' Association {{maintains}} a register. The Gujarat government maintains stud farms in eleven different locations; one in Junagadh holds both mares and stallions and is tasked with preserving the breed, while the other ten hold Kathiawari stallions that are used for improving the local stock of <b>other</b> <b>or</b> mixed breeds. In 2007, only about 50 Kathiawaris were held by private breeders.Today, the Panchaal region is renowned for its Kathiawari horses, often producing the most beautiful horses of the breed.|$|E
5|$|As {{characters}} gain experience points their mutant superpowers {{and unique}} abilities can be upgraded. Items found during gameplay {{can also be}} equipped to further enhance a character's abilities. Characters can combine attacks to create a combo, in which two or more players punch or kick a single enemy at the same time. The character's special abilities {{can also be used}} in the same manner to create a Super Combo which inflicts massive damage on enemies. Each character has several mutant powers that players can assign to controller buttons. The game also features a skirmish mode, which allows players to fight against each <b>other</b> <b>or</b> waves of computer-controlled enemies.|$|E

5|$|As of 2010, {{those of}} African ancestry {{accounted}} for 31.0% of Fort Lauderdale's population, which includes African Americans. Out of the 31.0%, 10.0% were West Indian or Afro-Caribbean American (6.4% Haitian, 2.5% Jamaican, 0.4% Bahamian, 0.2% <b>Other</b> <b>or</b> Unspecified West Indian, 0.2% British West Indian, 0.1% Trinidadian and Tobagonian, 0.1% Barbadian), 0.6% were Black Hispanics, and 0.5% were Subsaharan African.|$|E
5|$|As of {{the census}} of 2010, Jerome was home to 444 people {{comprising}} 253 households, 93 of which were families {{made up of a}} householder and one or more people related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption. The other 160 were non-family. The residents had a racial makeup that was nearly 94percent white, and the remainder was listed in the census as black or African American, Native American, Asian, <b>other,</b> <b>or</b> combinations thereof. About 6percent of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. The population, nearly evenly split along gender lines, consisted of 226 women with a median age of 54 and 218 men with a median age of 55. The estimated population in 2015 was 456.|$|E
5|$|Cross-linguistically, the-ma suffix may {{be related}} to a coverbial suffix in Jaminjung, a {{language}} in which coverb roots occur without any aspect markers, but are then suffixed with -mayan, which marks continuous aspect. This coverb suffix bears a striking resemblance to the sum of the Wagiman -ma suffix and the continuous aspect suffix -yan, which always occur in tandem on coverbs. Together, -ma and -yan perform the same semantic function as Jaminjung -mayan. Precisely what the relationship holds between these suffixes; whether one language borrowed from the <b>other,</b> <b>or</b> whether each language inherited them from earlier languages, is not at all clear.|$|E

5|$|Free-floating {{planets in}} stellar {{clusters}} have similar velocities {{to the stars}} and so can be recaptured. They are typically captured into wide orbits between 100 and 105 AU. The capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster volume, and for a given cluster size it increases with the host/primary mass. It is almost independent of the planetary mass. Single and multiple planets could be captured into arbitrary unaligned orbits, non-coplanar with each <b>other</b> <b>or</b> with the stellar host spin, or pre-existing planetary system.|$|E
5|$|From about 218 BC onwards, the archers of the Roman {{army of the}} mid-Republic were {{virtually}} all mercenaries from the island of Crete, which boasted a long specialist tradition. During the late Republic (88-30 BC) and the Augustan period, Crete was gradually eclipsed by men from other, much more populous, regions subjugated by the Romans with strong archery traditions. These included Thrace, Anatolia and above all, Syria. Of the 32 sagittarii units attested in the mid-2nd century, 13 have Syrian names, 7 Thracian, 5 from Anatolia, 1 from Crete and the remaining 6 of <b>other</b> <b>or</b> uncertain origin.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{executive}} {{power in the}} EU isn't concentrated in a single institution. It becomes clearer under the Lisbon Treaty with {{the division of the}} European Council as a distinct institution with a fixed President. This arrangement has been compared to the dual executive system found in the French republic where there is a President (the Council President) and Prime Minister (the Commission President). However, unlike the French model, the Council President does not hold formal powers such as the ability to directly appoint and sack the <b>other,</b> <b>or</b> the ability to dissolve Parliament. Hence while the Council President may have prestige, it would lack power and while the Commission President would have power, it would lack the prestige of the former.|$|E

5|$|Journey is Thatgamecompany's latest game. The player {{controls}} a robed {{figure who}} {{wakes up in}} a desert, with a large mountain in the distance as their destination. While traveling, the player can encounter other players over the Internet, one at a time. Players cannot communicate verbally, but may help each <b>other</b> <b>or</b> not as they wish. The game was released for the PlayStation 3 on March 13, 2012. Austin Wintory {{was nominated for a}} Grammy Award in 2013 for Best Score Soundtrack for Journey, the first such nomination for a full video game score, but lost to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.|$|E
5|$|Most {{aspects of}} the {{gameplay}} {{did not differ from}} the previous two titles. Wipeout is based on a futuristic anti-gravity setting where pilots would race against each <b>other</b> <b>or</b> computer-controlled AI opponents to finish in the highest position possible. Wipeout gameplay takes inspiration from Formula One parallels; rather than using aerodynamics to increase wheel grip by down-force for faster turning speeds, Wipeout uses a fictionalised method of air braking for ever greater turning force.|$|E
5|$|Off Enewetak, grey reef sharks exhibit {{different}} social behaviors on {{different parts of}} the reef. Sharks tend to be solitary on shallower reefs and pinnacles. Near reef drop-offs, loose aggregations of five to 20 sharks form in the morning and grow in number throughout the day before dispersing at night. In level areas, sharks form polarized schools (all swimming in the same direction) of around 30 individuals near the sea bottom, arranging themselves parallel to each <b>other</b> <b>or</b> slowly swimming in circles. Most individuals within polarized schools are females, and the formation of these schools has been theorized to relate to mating or pupping.|$|E
