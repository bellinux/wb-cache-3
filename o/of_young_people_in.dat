5|$|The {{walls of}} the church were {{completely}} restored in 2003. At {{the same time the}} altar was moved closer to the congregation, making more room for the choir. The baptismal font was relocated from the chapel to the front, opposite the ambo. The tabernacle, which had been where the baptismal font is now, and the crucifixion scene were moved to the chapel, creating a chapel for adoration. The restoration works were directed by Franz Josef Hamm from Limburg. The new cross above the altar was created by a group <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> preparation for confirmation. During the restoration the organ had to be taken apart. The parish decided not to restore it, but to have a new organ built.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} boom resulted in drawing {{large numbers of}} aborigines out of their villages and into the unskilled or low-skilled sector of the urban workforce. Manufacturing and construction jobs were generally available for low wages. The aborigines quickly formed bonds with other communities as they all had similar political motives to protect their collective needs {{as part of the}} labor force. The aborigines became the most skilled iron-workers and construction teams on the island often selected to work on the most difficult projects. The result was a mass exodus of indigenous members from their traditional lands and the cultural alienation <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the villages, who could not learn their languages or customs while employed. Often, young aborigines in the cities fall into gangs aligned with the construction trade. Recent laws governing the employment of laborers from Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines have also led to an increased atmosphere of xenophobia among urban aborigines, and encouraged the formulation of a pan-indigenous consciousness in the pursuit of political representation and protection.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the Qing Dynasty, Fuzhou {{society had}} been largely monolingual.

25|$|In addition, shifts {{can occur}} in reports of the {{prevalence}} of homosexuality. For example, the Hamburg Institute for Sexual Research conducted a survey over the sexual behavior <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> 1970 and repeated it in 1990.

25|$|Wolverhampton has a {{relatively}} old population, with {{the proportion of}} the population aged 60 and over being larger than the proportion of children aged 15 or under. The proportion <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the city has decreased between the 1991 Census and the 2001 Census by 7.4%, compared with an England and Wales average increase of 1.7%. The proportion of females within the city (51%) is slightly higher than that of males (49%).|$|E
25|$|In the city, the {{population}} was spread out with 34.7% {{under the age of}} 18, 7.8% from 18 to 24, 33.3% from 25 to 44, 17.2% from 45 to 64, and 7.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 31 years. The above average number <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Temecula was attributed to an influx of middle-class families came to buy homes in the 1990s real estate boom. For every 100 females there were 97.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 94.2 males.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{capacity}} of Old Trafford {{at the time was}} over 76,000, this was substantially reduced for the game due to the installation of two giant screens that would show a pre-match video featuring clips of Manchester United's involvement in European matches over the previous 50 years. By the weekend before the game, 70,000 tickets had been sold at £17 for adults, half-price for over-65s and £5 for under-16s. The capacity for the match was reportedly capped at 72,000; however, the attendance reported after the game was in excess of 74,000. Proceeds from ticket sales went towards the Manchester United Foundation, a group working towards improving the lives <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the local community using football.|$|E

25|$|Although {{there are}} {{hundreds}} of African-Caribbean teachers in the UK, {{it has been suggested that}} their under-representation in inner-city schools is a major factor in the failure, particularly of secondary-level schools, to achieve a satisfactory average of achievement for the community's children (see Bernard Coard and the Swann Report of 1985). Though research by the Longitudinal Survey <b>of</b> <b>Young</b> <b>People</b> <b>in</b> England in 2011 showed that 66 per cent of those from native African backgrounds went on to university, compared to an average of 59 per cent of British Asian (Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi) students, which therefore suggests that as an average, more people from Black African backgrounds are now progressing to university than those of a South Asian background.|$|E
25|$|After {{the return}} of democracy, {{the change in the}} status of women was dramatic. One {{significant}} indicator was the changing place of women in the work force. In the traditional Spanish world, women rarely entered the job market. By the late 1970s, however, 22 percent of the country's adult women, still somewhat fewer than in Italy and in Ireland, had entered the work force. By 1984 this figure had increased to 33 percent, a level not significantly different from Italy or the Netherlands. Women still made up less than one-third of the total labor force, however, and in some important sectors, such as banking, the figure was closer to one-tenth. A 1977 opinion poll revealed that when asked whether a woman's place was in the home only 22 percent <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Spain agreed, compared with 26 percent in Britain, 30 percent in Italy, and 37 percent in France. The principal barrier to women in the work place, however, was not public opinion, but rather such factors as a high unemployment rate and a lack of part-time jobs. In education, women were rapidly achieving parity with men, at least statistically. In 1983, approximately 46 percent of Spain's university enrollment was female, the thirty-first highest percentage in the world, and comparable to most other European countries.|$|E

500|$|In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand, the V sign or [...] "the fingers", {{when given}} with {{back of the}} hand towards the recipient, serves a similar purpose. George H. W. Bush, former President of the United States, accidentally made the gesture while on a {{diplomatic}} trip to Australia. In countries where Spanish, Portuguese, or French are spoken, and especially in Spain, Portugal, Brazil, and France the gesture involving raising a fist and slapping the biceps on the same arm as the fist used, sometimes called the bras d'honneur or Iberian slap, {{is equivalent to the}} finger. Italy, Poland, and countries under the influence of Russian culture, such as Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine, also see it as equivalent to the finger, but the majority <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> these countries use the finger as an insult, which is associated with the Western culture.|$|E
500|$|In another incident, eight {{witnesses}} {{reported the}} recapture {{of a young}} woman after an apparent escape attempt in September 1918 at a railway station at Siding 37, northwest of Perm. These witnesses were Maxim Grigoyev, Tatiana Sitnikova (and her son Fyodor Sitnikov), Ivan Kuklin and Matrina Kuklina, Vassily Ryabov, Ustinya Varankina, and Dr Pavel Utkin, a physician who treated the girl after the incident. Some of the witnesses identified the girl as Anastasia when they were shown photographs of the grand duchess by White Russian Army investigators. Utkin also told the White Russian Army investigators that the injured girl, whom he treated at Cheka headquarters in Perm, told him, [...] "I am the daughter of the ruler, Anastasia." [...] Utkin obtained a prescription from a pharmacy for a patient named [...] "N" [...] at the orders of the secret police. White Army investigators later independently located records for the prescription. During the same time period in mid-1918, there were several reports <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Russia passing themselves off as Romanov escapees. Boris Soloviev, the husband of Rasputin's daughter Maria, defrauded prominent Russian families by asking for money for a Romanov impostor to escape to China. Soloviev also found young women willing to masquerade as one of the grand duchesses to assist in deceiving the families he had defrauded.|$|E
