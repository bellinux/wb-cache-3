40|$|A phenomenological {{relationship}} between oscillations in a sunspot and quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP) in flaring energy releases at an active region (AR) above the sunspot is established. The {{analysis of the}} microwave emission recorded by the Nobeyama Radioheliograph at 17 GHz shows a gradual increase {{in the power of}} the 3 -min <b>oscillation</b> <b>train</b> in the sunspot associated with AR 10756 before flares in this AR. The flaring light curves are found to be bursty with a period of 3 min. Our analysis of the spatial distribution of the 3 -min oscillation power implies that the oscillations follow from sunspots along coronal loops towards the flaring site. It is proposed that QPP in the flaring energy releases can be triggered by 3 -min slow magnetoacoustic waves leaking from sunspots...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} observational and theoretical {{analysis of the}} amplitudes and profiles of oscillations that occur during thermonuclear X-ray bursts from weakly-magnetized neutron stars in low mass X-ray binaries. Our sample contains 59 oscillations detected for several seconds each in observations of six sources with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. We find that the oscillations are as large as 15 % during {{the decline of the}} bursts, and they appear and disappear due to intrinsic variations in their fractional amplitudes. However, the maxima in the amplitudes are not related to the underlying flux in the burst. We derive folded profiles for each <b>oscillation</b> <b>train</b> to study the pulse morphologies. The mean rms amplitudes of the oscillations are 5 %, although the eclipsing source MXB 1659 − 298 routinely produces 10 % oscillations in weak bursts. We also produce combined profiles from all of the oscillations from each source. Using these pulse profiles, we place upper limits on the fractional amplitudes of harmonic and half-frequency signals of less than 0. 3 % and 0. 6 %, respectively (95 % confidence). These correspond to less than 5 % of the strongest signal at integer harmonics, and less than 10 % of the main signal at half-integer harmonics. We then compare the pulse morphologies to theoretical profiles from models with one or two antipodal bright regions on the surface of a rotating neutron star. We find that if one bright region is present on the star, it must either lie near the rotational pole or cover nearly half the neutron star in order to be consistent with the observed lack of harmonic signals. If an antipodal pattern is present, the hot regions must form very near the rotational equator. We discuss how these geometric constraints challenge current models for the production of brightness variations on the surface of a neutron star...|$|E

High-resolution data obtained with the Nobeyama Radioheliograph, TRACE and SDO/AIA are analysed {{with the use of the}} Pixelised Wavelet Filtering and wavelet skeleton techniques. 3 -min oscillations in sunspots appear in the form of repetitive trains of the duration 8 - 20 min (13 min in average). The typical interval between the trains is 30 - 50 min. The <b>oscillation</b> <b>trains</b> are transient in frequency and power. We detected a repetitive frequency drifts of 3 -min oscillations during the development of individual trains. Wavelet analysis shows three types of the frequency drift: positive, negative and fluctuations without drift. The start and end of the drifts coincide with the start time and end of the train. The comparative study of 3 -min oscillations in the sequences of microwave and EUV images show the appearance of new sources of the oscillations in sunspots during the development of the trains. These structures can be interpreted as waveguides that channel upward propagating waves, responsible for 3 -min oscillations. A possible explanation of the observed properties is the operation of two simultaneous factors: dispersive evolution of the upwardly-propagating wave pulses and the non-uniformity of the distribution of the oscillation power over the sunspot umbra with different wave sources corresponding to different magnetic flux tubes with different physical conditions and line-of-sight angles.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{frequency}} evolution of millisecond oscillations observed during type I X-ray bursts with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer {{in order to}} establish the stability of the mechanism underlying the oscillations. Our sample contains 68 pulse trains detected in a search of 159 bursts from 8 accreting neutron stars. As a first step, we confirm that the oscillations usually drift upward in frequency by about 1 % toward an apparent saturation frequency. Previously noted anomalies, such as drifts toward lower frequencies as the oscillations disappear (``spin-down'' episodes) and instances of two signals present simultaneously at frequencies separated by a few Hz, occur in 5 % of oscillations. Having verified the generally accepted description of burst oscillations, we proceed to study the coherence of the oscillations during individual bursts, and the dispersion in the asymptotic frequencies in bursts observed over five years. On short time scales, we find that 30 % of the <b>oscillation</b> <b>trains</b> do not appear to evolve smoothly in phase. This suggests either that two signals are present simultaneously with a frequency difference too small to resolve (< 1 Hz), that the frequency evolution is discontinuous, or that discrete phase jumps occur. On time scales of years, the maximum frequencies of the oscillations exhibit fractional dispersions of < 0. 004. In the case of 4 U 1636 - 536, this dispersion is uncorrelated with the known orbital phase, which indicates that a mechanism besides orbital Doppler shifts prevents the oscillations from appearing perfectly stable. We interpret these results under the assumption that the oscillations originate from anisotropies in the emission from the surfaces of these rotating neutron stars.

The power significantly varies in time, forming distinct <b>oscillation</b> <b>trains.</b> The <b>oscillation</b> power distribution over the sunspot in the horizontal plane {{reveals that the}} enhancements of the oscillation amplitude, or wave fronts, have a distinct structure consisting of an evolving two-armed spiral and a stationary circular patch at the spiral origin, situated near the umbra centre. This structure is seen from the temperature minimum to the corona. In time, the spiral rotates anti-clockwise. The wave front spirality is most pronounced during the maximum amplitude phases of the oscillations. In the low-amplitude phases the spiral breaks into arc-shaped patches. The 2 D cross-correlation function shows that the oscillations at higher atmospheric levels occur later than at lower layers. The phase speed {{is estimated to be}} about 100 km/s. The fine spectral analysis shows that the central patch corresponds to the high-frequency oscillations, while the spiral arms highlight the lower-frequency oscillations in the 3 -min band. The vertical and horizontal radial structure of the oscillations is consistent with the model that interprets umbral oscillations as slow magnetoacoustic waves filtered by the atmospheric temperature non-uniformity {{in the presence of the}} magnetic field inclination from the vertical.

40|$|Context. Umbral flashes (UFs) {{are most}} common {{phenomenon}} of wave processes in sunspots. Studying {{the relationship between}} wave time dynamics and UF origin requires further investigating their fine spatial and height structure. Aims. We investigated the association between a short-time increase in the variations of 3 -minute EUV emission at footpoints of coronal magnetic loops and the UF emergence in sunspot umbrae. Methods. We applied the Pixelized Wavelet Filtering (PWF) technique to analyze a cube of the images obtained by SDO/AIA at 1600 Å, 304 Å, and 171 Å to study the spatio-temporal dynamic of oscillations in individual magnetic loops. The time-distance plots were used to obtain the wave front propagation velocity. We used the magnetic field extrapolation for SDO/HMI magnetograms to obtain localization of the magnetic loop footpoins. Results. For the first time, we obtained 2 D images of fine wave processes in magnetic structures of different scales related to umbral flashes. UFs sources were mainly localized at the magnetic loop footpoints anchored in an umbra. We revealed two types UFs, point and extended. The first type {{is related to the}} footpoints of open field lines, the second is associated with the closed. The time dynamics of UFs shows an increase the oscillations before the peak value within one low-frequency wave train. It is shown that the maxima of <b>oscillation</b> <b>trains</b> coincide with the peak intensity of umbral flashes. Conclusions. The sunspot wave dynamics showed a relation between the localization of oscillations power peak at the coronal magnetic loop footpoints and the UF origin. The spatial structure of the UF sources, their power and lifetime are determined by the cut-off frequency of the waves for the detected waveguides. We concluded that UFs are a process of short-time increase of the wave activity at the footpoints of magnetic loops.

40|$|I analyze 68 <b>oscillation</b> <b>trains</b> {{detected}} {{in a search}} of 159 thermonuclear bursts from eight neutron star X-ray binaries observed with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. I use all data that were public as of September 2001. The frequencies of the oscillations are uniformly distributed between 270 - 620 Hz, and are nearly constant for a given source. They typically have fractional rms amplitudes of 5 %. During a burst, the frequencies of the oscillations generally drift upward by - 4 Hz to stable limiting values. Neither the amplitudes of the oscillations nor the evolution of their frequencies are simply related to the time scales and energetics of the bursts. If the frequency drift is accounted for with smooth functions, the oscillations are coherent in 70 % of the bursts, and their asymptotic frequencies are stable to a few parts in 1000. This suggests that the asymptotic frequencies {{are determined by the}} spin of the neutron star. However, residual dispersion in the frequencies from 4 U 1636 - 536 is uncorrelated with the known orbit of the system, so some mechanism other than the orbital motion of the neutron star must cause them to vary. Models for the oscillations suggest that they originate from patterns in the stellar surface brightness that drift in the direction opposite the rotation of the neutron star, yielding oscillation frequencies lower than that of the spin. The patterns produce oscillations that are very sinusoidal - harmonic components have amplitudes that are less than 5 - 10 % of those of the main signals. This suggests that the patterns are very symmetric. The types of bursts that exhibit oscillations are correlated with the pulsation frequency. (cont.) In particular, oscillations between 500 - 650 Hz occur almost exclusively in bursts that exhibit photospheric radius expansion, while oscillations with frequencies of 250 - 400 Hz are slightly more likely to occur in bursts without radius expansion. This appears to be because (i) oscillations from all of the sources are observed only when the persistent accretion rate is relatively high (- 0. 1 lMEdd), while (ii) in - 300 Hz sources radius expansion occurs at lower M, yet in - 600 Hz sources it occurs at higher M. by Michael Patrick Muno.

We {{analysed}} 3 -min oscillations of {{microwave and}} extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission generated at different heights of a sunspot atmosphere, studied the amplitude and frequency modulation of the oscillations, {{and its relationship}} with the variation of the spatial structure of the oscillations. Methods. High-resolution data obtained with the Nobeyama Radioheliograph, TRACE and SDO/AIA were analysed with pixelised wavelet filtering (PWF) and wavelet skeleton techniques. Results. Three-minute oscillations in sunspots appear in the form of recurring trains of 8 - 20 min duration (13 min in average). The typical interval between the trains is 30 - 50 min. The <b>oscillation</b> <b>trains</b> are transient in frequency and power. The relative amplitude of 3 -min oscillations was about 3 - 8 % and sometimes reached 17 %. Recurring frequency drifts of 3 -min oscillations were detected during the development of individual trains, with the period varying in the range 90 - 240 s. A wavelet analysis showed that there are three types of oscillation trains: with positive drifts (to high frequencies), negative drifts, and without a drift. Negative drifts, i. e., when the 3 -min oscillation period gradually increases, were found to occur more often. The start and end of the drifts coincides with the start time and end of the train. Sometimes two drifts co-exist, i. e. during the end of the previous drift, a new drift appears near 160 s, when the frequency is in the low-frequency part of the 3 -min spectrum, near 200 s. This behaviour is seen {{at all levels of the}} sunspot atmosphere. The speed of the drift is 4 - 5 mHz/h in the photosphere, 5 - 8 mHz/h in the chromosphere, and 11 - 13 mHz/h in the corona. There were also low-frequency peaks in the spectrum, corresponding to the periods of 10 - 20 min, and 30 - 60 min. The comparative study of the spatial structure of 3 -min oscillations in microwave and EUV shows the appearance of new sources of the sunspot oscillations during the development of the trains. Conclusions. These structures can be interpreted as waveguides that channel upward propagating waves, which in turn are responsible for the 3 -min oscillations.

40|$|Estimation of {{the power}} {{spectrum}} is a common method for identifying oscillatory changes in neuronal activity. However, the stochastic nature of neuronal activity leads to severe biases in the estimation of these oscillations in single unit spike trains. Different biological and experimental factors cause the spike train to differentially reflect its underlying oscillatory rate function. We analyzed the effect of factors, such as the mean firing rate and the recording duration, on the detectability of oscillations and their significance, and tested these theoretical results on experimental data recorded in Parkinsonian non-human primates. The effect of these factors is dramatic, such that in some conditions, the detection of existing oscillations is impossible. Moreover, these biases impede the comparison of oscillations across brain regions, neuronal types, behavioral states and separate recordings with different underlying parameters, and lead inevitably to a gross misinterpretation of experimental results.

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a nonlinear control approach to variable speed wind turbine (VSWT) with a wind speed estimator. The {{dynamics of the}} wind turbine (WT) is derived from single mass model. In this work, a modified Newton Raphson estimator has been considered for exact estimation of effective wind speed. The main objective of this work is to extract maximum energy from the wind at below rated wind speed while reducing drive <b>train</b> <b>oscillation.</b> In order to achieve the above objectives, VSWT should operate close to the optimal power coefficient. The generator torque is considered as the control input to achieve maximum energy capture. From the literature, {{it is clear that}} existing linear and nonlinear control techniques suffer from poor tracking of WT dynamics, increased power loss and complex control law. In addition, they are not robust with respect to input disturbances. In order to overcome the above drawbacks, adaptive fuzzy integral sliding mode control (AFISMC) is proposed for VSWT control. The proposed controller is tested with different types of disturbances and compared with other nonlinear controllers such as sliding mode control and integral sliding mode control. The result shows the better performance of AFISMC and its robustness to input disturbances. In this paper, the discontinuity in integral sliding mode controller is smoothed by using hyperbolic tangent function, and the sliding gain is adapted using a fuzzy technique which makes the controller more robust.|$|R
40|$|Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) (Diptera Drosophilidae), {{the spotted}} wing {{drosophila}} (SWD), {{is a major}} pest in many Holartic areas, which is spreading as an invasive species across Europe and North America. Females are able to lay eggs in ripening fruits and seem to prefer these over overripe ones, seriously affecting the production. Long-term and sustainable solutions are required to control the pest spread and damages. In several species of the genus Drosophila a specie-specific courtship song has been described. Instead, to date, the mating behaviour of SWD was believed to focus only on visual signals. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the use of acoustic, in particular substrate-borne, signals by the SWD during the courtship. In laboratory, pairs of flies (one male and one female) were placed into a recording arena, a laser vibrometer recorded the substrate-borne vibrations and simultaneously the behaviour was recorded with camcorder for all the mating process. During courtship the male can produce three specie-specific signals: broadband pulses, associated with dorso-ventral abdominal <b>oscillations,</b> emitted in <b>trains</b> of variable length and irregular repetition rate (“quivering”), a brief sound with harmonic structure (“toot”), often associated to a “pulse” song, which consist of short trains of pulses with specie-specific pulse repetition time. The analysis of the videos showed a tight combination between visual and acoustic/vibrational cues to increase females acceptance. Further studies on the relevance of vibrational signals over the visual ones can enable the development of a specie-specific mating disruption approach, as it has already been done for other insect pests...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: All {{kinds of}} blood {{manipulations}} aim {{to increase the}} total hemoglobin mass (tHb-mass). To establish tHb-mass as an effective screening parameter for detecting blood doping, the knowledge of its normal variation over time is necessary. The aim of the present study, therefore, {{was to determine the}} intraindividual variance of tHb-mass in elite athletes during a training year emphasizing off, training, and race seasons at sea level. METHODS: tHb-mass and hemoglobin concentration ([Hb]) were determined in 24 endurance athletes five times during a year and were compared with a control group (n = 6). An analysis of covariance was used to test the effects of training phases, age, gender, competition level, body mass, and training volume. Three error models, based on 1) a total percentage error of measurement, 2) the combination of a typical percentage error (TE) of analytical origin with an absolute SD of biological origin, and 3) between-subject and within-subject variance components as obtained by an analysis of variance, were tested. RESULTS: In addition to the expected influence of performance status, the main results were that the effects of training volume (P = 0. 20) and training phases (P = 0. 81) on tHb-mass were not significant. We found that within-subject variations mainly have an analytical origin (TE approximately 1. 4 %) and a very small SD (7. 5 g) of biological origin. CONCLUSION: tHb-mass shows very low individual <b>oscillations</b> during a <b>training</b> year (< 6 %), and these oscillations are below the expected changes in tHb-mass due to Herythropoetin (EPO) application or blood infusion (approximately 10 %). The high stability of tHb-mass over a period of 1 year suggests that it should be included in an athlete's biological passport and analyzed by recently developed probabilistic inference techniques that define subject-based reference ranges...|$|R
30|$|Fuzzy logic {{controller}} (FLC) is developed for maximum power extraction at below rated wind speed [7]. The main {{aim of the}} FLC is to track the optimal power by adjusting the rotational speed of the turbine. The advantage of FLC is that, it doesn’t require any information about the wind speed. Input to the FLC is rotor speed and mechanical power output, and output is reference rotor speed. Radial bias function based NN control for variable speed variable pitch WT is proposed in [8] for various operating regions of wind speed. NN control can able to approximate the nonlinear dynamics of WT input and output measurements and it can ensure the smooth tracking of optimal tip speed ratio at different wind speeds. Lyapunov stability approach is used for updating the NN weights. Nonlinear static and dynamic state feedback linearization control for power optimization is addressed in [9, 10], where both the single and two mass model are taken into consideration and the wind speed is estimated by Newton Rapshon (NR) method. To extract the optimal power at below rated wind speed, using adaptive fuzzy integral sliding mode control (AFISMC) with {{the different types of}} input disturbance (maximum 10 kNm) for variable speed wind turbine is presented in [11]. The proposed controller is tested with different mean wind speed in order to ensure the robustness of the controller. In [12], fuzzy sliding mode controller (FSMC) based maximum power extraction for VSWT is proposed. In [13], electromagnetic interaction with doubly-fed induction machine (DFIG) is used for wind farm power smoothing. The adaptability of the proposed controller is tested with model uncertainty of the WT system with the presence of disturbance of 1 kNm. From the analysis, it is concluded that a tradeoff is maintained between maximum power capture and drive <b>train</b> <b>oscillation.</b> The wind speed is estimated by using modified Newton Rapshon (MNR) for above two references. In this work, backstepping sliding mode control (BSMC) based control of WT for maximum power capture is proposed. The proposed BSMC is initially tested with mathematical model and finally validated through fatigue, aerodynamics, structures, and turbulence (FAST) model. It is also clear that compared to sliding mode controller(SMC), BSMC is robust with respect to disturbances. One more advantage compared to [12, 13, 14] is that no additional soft computing technique is required to extract the maximum power; BSMC itself is able to accommodate the disturbance level up to 10 kNm.|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{studies of}} the {{dual-mode}} scramjet isolator, a critical component in preventing inlet unstart and/or vehicle loss by containing a collection of flow disturbances called a shock train, have been performed since the dual-mode propulsion cycle {{was introduced in the}} 1960 s. Low momentum corner flow and other three-dimensional effects inherent to rectangular isolators have, however, been largely ignored in experimental {{studies of the}} boundary layer separation driven isolator shock train dynamics. Furthermore, the use of two dimensional diagnostic techniques in past works, be it single-perspective line-of-sight schlieren/shadowgraphy or single axis wall pressure measurements, have been unable to resolve the three-dimensional flow features inside the rectangular isolator. These flow characteristics need to be thoroughly understood if robust dual-mode scramjet designs are to be fielded. The work presented in this thesis is focused on experimentally analyzing shock train/boundary layer interactions from multiple perspectives in aspect ratio 1. 0, 3. 0, and 6. 0 rectangular isolators with inflow Mach numbers ranging from 2. 4 to 2. 7. Secondary steady-state Computational Fluid Dynamics studies are performed to compare to the experimental results and to provide additional perspectives of the flow field. Specific issues that remain unresolved after decades of isolator shock train studies that are addressed in this work include the three-dimensional formation of the isolator shock train front, the spatial and temporal low momentum corner flow separation scales, the transient behavior of shock train/boundary layer interaction at specific coordinates along the isolator's lateral axis, and effects of the rectangular geometry on semi-empirical relations for shock train length prediction. A novel multiplane shadowgraph technique is developed to resolve the structure of the shock train along both the minor and major duct axis simultaneously. It is shown that the shock train front is of a hybrid oblique/normal nature. Initial low momentum corner flow separation spawns the formation of oblique shock planes which interact and proceed toward the center flow region, becoming more normal in the process. The hybrid structure becomes more two-dimensional as aspect ratio is increased but corner flow separation precedes center flow separation on the order of 1 duct height for all aspect ratios considered. Additional instantaneous oil flow surface visualization shows the symmetry of the three-dimensional shock train front around the lower wall centerline. Quantitative synthetic schlieren visualization shows the density gradient magnitude approximately double between the corner oblique and center flow normal structures. Fast response pressure measurements acquired near the corner region of the duct show preliminary separation in the outer regions preceding centerline separation on the order of 2 seconds. Non-intrusive Focusing Schlieren Deflectometry Velocimeter measurements reveal that both shock <b>train</b> <b>oscillation</b> frequency and velocity component decrease as measurements are taken away from centerline and towards the side-wall region, along with confirming the more two dimensional shock train front approximation for higher aspect ratios. An updated modification to Waltrup & Billig's original semi-empirical shock train length relation for circular ducts based on centerline pressure measurements is introduced to account for rectangular isolator aspect ratio, upstream corner separation length scale, and major- and minor-axis boundary layer momentum thickness asymmetry. The latter is derived both experimentally and computationally and it is shown that the major-axis (side-wall) boundary layer has lower momentum thickness compared to the minor-axis (nozzle bounded) boundary layer, making it more separable. Furthermore, it is shown that the updated correlation drastically improves shock train length prediction capabilities in higher aspect ratio isolators. This thesis suggests that performance analysis of rectangular confined supersonic flow fields can no longer be based on observations and measurements obtained along a single axis alone. Knowledge gained by the work performed in this study will allow for the development of more robust shock train leading edge detection techniques and isolator designs which can greatly mitigate the risk of inlet unstart and/or vehicle loss in flight...|$|R
