A tax incentive is proposed and examined as a form <b>of</b> revenue source <b>subsidy</b> which can be coupled with a congestion tolllgasoline tax policy to accomplish this demand stimulation, and is examined in light of the associated public policy issues. Taken into account are the typology <b>of</b> <b>subsidy,</b> the justification for <b>subsidy,</b> the sources <b>of</b> <b>subsidy</b> and the impact of different types <b>of</b> <b>subsidy</b> on economic factors, such as price and cost.

40|$|Small-scale {{anaerobic}} digester installation {{has been a}} development objective of the Indian government to provide rural households clean fuel. Anaerobic digester installation is heavily subsidised. Depending on caste, the rate <b>of</b> <b>subsidy</b> offered for the smallest system available (1 m 3) varies between 32. 35 % and 41. 18 % of the total installation price. Yet, there are gaps in knowledge regarding the usefulness <b>of</b> such <b>subsidies</b> from a sustainability perspective. A cost-benefit analysis was conducted to evaluate the circumstances required for digester sustainability. The analysis used household data collected from 115 cattle owning households in Odisha, India to evaluate profitability at three levels <b>of</b> <b>subsidy</b> (none, General caste subsidy, and Schedule Caste/Schedule Tribe subsidy). Additional analyses considered the effect of; taking a loan, replacing electric lighting with biogas lighting, and the wealth level of the household. The results indicated that access to subsidy improved profitability. Yet, profitability could be achieved without the use <b>of</b> <b>subsidy.</b> The level <b>of</b> benefit accrued by households was similar independent of wealth. However, the provision <b>of</b> <b>subsidy</b> was essential for ensuring profitability for those households required to take a loan to meet the expense of installation. Such findings highlight the importance <b>of</b> <b>subsidy</b> {{as a means of}} including the poor...|$|R
5|$|An {{agreement}} for the provision <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> on services to Oslo and Bergen was not reached with the Ministry of Transport until 1990. The state {{agreed to provide}} NOK 4.5 million, with the municipalities providing another NOK 2.6 million, and Oppland County Municipality NOK 2 million. The county and municipalities were allowed to reduce their subsidies {{in the event that}} passenger numbers increased. Although initially planned to be introduced in January 1990, Widerøe later dropped out, and the contract was awarded to Coast Air, who began operating on 3September 1990, using a de Havilland Canada Twin Otter aircraft. The deal was the most expensive subsidy for regional aviation in the country; while the national average was NOK 156, the Fagernes route cost the authorities NOK 2,000 per passenger.|$|E
5|$|During the 1840s, Indiana {{completed}} {{the removal of}} the Native American tribes. The majority of the Potawatomi voluntarily relocated to Kansas in 1838. Those who did not leave were forced to travel to Kansas in what came to be called the Potawatomi Trail of Death, leaving only the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians in the Indiana area. The majority of the Miami tribe left in 1846, although many members of the tribe were permitted to remain in the state on lands they held privately {{under the terms of the}} 1818 Treaty of St. Mary's. The other tribes were also convinced to leave the state voluntarily through the payment <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> and land grants further west. The Shawnee migrated westward to settle in Missouri, and the Lenape migrated into Canada. The other minor tribes in the state, including the Wea, moved westward, mostly to Kansas.|$|E

At {{the same time}} the ministry and SAS started looking at the airport structure in Finnmark, as all the services in the county were in need <b>of</b> <b>subsidies.</b> The proposals were either for a hike in the ticket prices or a reduction of Kirkenes to a regional-only airport. SAS was flying a 90-seat aircraft two to three times per day between Kirkenes and Alta with only ten to fifteen passengers. The airport structure was kept, but ticket prices continued to rise. The airport served 110,000 passengers in 1983. Norving continued Varangfly's air ambulance contract until 1987, when the service was taken over by Air Express. Later the contract was awarded to Lufttransport, who operated the Beechcraft Super King Air. Norving filed for bankruptcy in 1992 and their routes were taken over by Widerøe.|$|E
50|$|A key {{principle}} of Singapore's national health scheme {{is that no}} medical service is provided free of charge, regardless of the level <b>of</b> <b>subsidy,</b> even within the public healthcare system. This mechanism is intended to reduce the over-utilisation of healthcare services. Out-of-pocket charges vary considerably for each service and level <b>of</b> <b>subsidy.</b> At the highest level <b>of</b> <b>subsidy,</b> although each out-of-pocket expense is typically small, costs can accumulate and become substantial for patients and families. At the lowest level, the subsidy is in effect nonexistent, and patients are treated like private patients, even within the public system.|$|R

As one of its last acts the Greater London Council paid for the replacement of two bridges on the line, allowing operations to continue. The centenary of the line in 1989 saw a renewal of interest and an upgrading of the trains between Chalfont& Latimer and London Marylebone station made commuting more practical, and usage of the line stabilised. The introduction of London Underground S Stock in 2010 led to the replacement of the shuttle service with half-hourly through trains to and from London.|$|E

However, he remained in I Corps and was still regarded as a significant political influence and motivating factor for the Struggle Movement. Regardless of what he may have thought, the discontent against Kỳ was by then {{too much for him}} to control even if he had wanted to. By June, ARVN loyalists, {{with the help of the}} American forces, prevailed. Their superior numbers convinced many in the Struggle Movement to back down and realign with the government, and those who refused were militarily defeated, often in bitter street-to-street fighting. While the Struggle Movement was finally ebbing away, Thi agreed to meet with Kỳ at an American air base in Chu Lai to reach a settlement, seeing as the junta was going to prevail in any case. Thi agreed to the original offers <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> and the cover story of a medical trip.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner {{proposed}} a fiscal austerity program in early 2012, including the gradual removal <b>of</b> <b>subsidies.</b> The proposal {{turned out to}} be unpopular, and was not implemented. She opted instead to send a bill to Congress for the renationalization of YPF, privatized in 1993, blaming the Spanish company Repsol for the energy trade deficit. The bill was approved by the Chamber of Deputies by a 207-32 margin. It was criticized as an authoritarian move, as there was no negotiation with Repsol. As well, the Vaca Muerta oil field had been discovered by this time. However, YPF was unable to afford the costs to exploit the oil at the site, and the rights to drill at Vaca Muerta were sold to the Chevron Corporation. The costs of energy imports increased the trade deficit and the inflation rate, and power outages became frequent. Outages usually took place on the hottest days of the summer season, as the use of air conditioning increased electricity consumption to peak levels.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to clarify}} the effect <b>of</b> private high-school <b>subsidy</b> on the {{decision}} of school fee of the private high-school in Tokyo. The formula <b>of</b> private high-school <b>subsidy</b> includes the price of school fee. If the school fee is too high, the amount <b>of</b> <b>subsidy</b> automatically goes down. This system tries to make the school fee keep low, but does it really works ? To answer this question, this paper examines the effect <b>of</b> <b>subsidy</b> by regression. The result of the regression shows that there are effects <b>of</b> the <b>subsidy</b> in the school fee, but {{the difficulty of the}} entrance exams and whether establishing other schools or not, effects more on deciding the price of the school fee. // This result leads tconclusion that not all high-schools are under the effect <b>of</b> <b>subsidy</b> formula.

5|$|Whereas Henry VII had not {{involved}} Parliament in his affairs very much, Henry VIII {{had to turn}} to Parliament during his reign for money, in particular for grants <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> to fund his wars. The Dissolution of the Monasteries provided a means to replenish the treasury, {{and as a result}} the Crown took possession of monastic lands worth £120,000 (£36million) a year. The Crown had profited a small amount in 1526 when Wolsey had put England onto a gold, rather than silver, standard, and had debased the currency slightly. Cromwell debased the currency more significantly, starting in Ireland in 1540. The English pound halved in value against the Flemish pound between 1540 and 1551 as a result. The nominal profit made was significant, helping to bring income and expenditure together, but it had a catastrophic effect on the overall economy of the country. In part, it helped to bring about a period of very high inflation from 1544 onwards.|$|E

40|$|Investment in {{emerging}} technologies is particularly challenging, since, apart from uncertainty in revenue streams, firms must also {{take into account}} both policy uncertainty and the random arrival of innovations. We assume that the former {{is reflected in the}} sudden provision and retraction of a support scheme, which {{takes the form of a}} fixed premium on top of the output price. Thus, we develop an analytical framework for sequential investment in order to determine how price, technological, and policy uncertainty interact to affect the decision to invest sequentially in successively improved versions of an emerging technology. We show that greater likelihood <b>of</b> <b>subsidy</b> retraction lowers the incentive to invest, whereas greater likelihood <b>of</b> <b>subsidy</b> provision facilitates investment. However, embedded options to invest in improved technology versions raise the value of the investment opportunity, thereby mitigating the impact <b>of</b> <b>subsidy</b> retraction and making the impact <b>of</b> <b>subsidy</b> provision more pronounced. Additionally, by allowing for sequential policy interventions, we find that the impact of policy uncertainty becomes less pronounced as the number of policy interventions increases...|$|R
