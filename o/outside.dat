5|$|Another {{issue was}} whether the {{exterior}} shutter over Madeleine's bedroom window could be opened from <b>outside.</b> According to journalist Danny Collins, the shutter was made of non-ferrous metal slats on a roller blind that was housed in a box {{at the top of}} the inside window, controlled by pulling on a strap. Once rolled down, the slats locked in place <b>outside</b> the window and could be raised only by using the strap on the inside. Kate said the shutter and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed, but open when she discovered Madeleine was missing. Gerry told the Polícia Judiciária that, when he was first alerted to the disappearance, he had lowered the shutter, then had gone <b>outside</b> and discovered that it could be raised only from the <b>outside.</b> Against this, the police said the shutter could not be raised from the <b>outside</b> without being forced, but there was no sign of forced entry; they also said forcing the shutter open would have caused a lot of noise.|$|E

30|$|Based on our discussions, we set {{proposed}} {{model for}} analysis. We explain factors to set hypotheses. First of all, considering {{from previous studies}} about open innovation, “customer needs” might be a trigger to use resources <b>outsides</b> [3, 9]. If members understood the importance of customer needs, members would utilize different resources to satisfy with customers. So identifying customer needs influences cooperation with others <b>outsides.</b> In addition, Japanese firms may get different resources beyond internal boundaries because some Japanese firms have same departments in-house and various resources [15, 25]. Instead of utilization of resources <b>outsides,</b> {{it is possible to}} use internal resources through in-company cooperation.|$|R
