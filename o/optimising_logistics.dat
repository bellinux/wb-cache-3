40|$|Logistics is a {{scientific}} discipline, a business function and an activity that, in recent times, is increasingly being applied to {{economic and social}} activities, because it enables {{the production of a}} quality product at a moderate cost. With regard to the trend for globally applying the principles of logistics to all spheres of human activities, the phenomenon of tourism presents a special challenge.

However applying the BSC to optimize VNT’s logistics presents five challenges: (i) no experience with the BSC, (ii) lacking performance drivers, (iii) traditional culture, (iv) ambiguous leadership commitment, (v) scarce staff-resources. The fourth and fifth challenges are of major concern because the conventional BSC-approach requires both leadership commitment and staff-resources. This report presents a BSC-proposal for <b>optimising</b> VNT’s <b>logistics</b> that is tested by a proof of concept. Based on desk research and interviews the conventional BSC-approach (Kaplan, 2010) can be adapted by a selection of frames – a modified BSC-frame, a logistics frame and a Performance measurement system-frame – to propose a suitable BSC to VNT for logistics optimisation. Nine opportunities (SWOT) for logistics optimization, of which three lack leadership commitment, are identified based on interviews, observation and data-analysis. A BSC, presented by a strategy-map consistent with eight out of nine opportunities, is proposed to VNT. The implementation plan is a roadmap to achieve the strategic goals for the perspectives of internal process and learning & growth of the strategy map. A Prototype-PMS that has the TMS as only data-source is designed, developed and used for evaluation. The practical utility is that logistics optimization {{by means of the}} proposed BSC is possible to some extent. The scientific utility is that the proof of concept shows the feasibility of the approach used in this situation. Therefore main conclusion is that a suitable BSC is proposed to <b>optimise</b> VNT’s <b>logistics</b> while taking into account that extensive triangulation limited internal –and structural validity of the implementation plan and PMS-prototype.

40|$|Biomass is {{expected}} {{to be one of the}} most important "green" energy suppliers in the EU. The European Commission forces the substitution of biomass for primary energy to increase the rate from 3. 5 % today to about 3. 5 % by 2010. The combustion of biomass is a common technology to produce energy. The increased international and national political support strengthens the new market for biogene fuels. Furthermore, as a result of the new German legislation on closed loop materials economy the amount of biomass to be handled will increase a lot. Because of a relatively low energy density of the biogene fuels the logistics efforts influence the costs of energy production decisively. Besides,the wide spread sources of biomass the various types of handling and pre-treatment of the biomass, and the varying qualities of biogene fuels set a high standard of the logistic strategies within the different regions.

40|$|Thesis (MComm (Logistics)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. One of {{the results}} of {{globalisation}} is that supply chains are getting longer, in both time and distance. For example, the local bookstore around the corner now competes with the bookstore in the USA. Logistics ties together geographically distant sources and markets. The implications of this are that there is a greater need for efficiency in specifically transportation and distribution networks. The integration of transport infrastructure into a logistics hub is seen as an enabler of distribution on a global basis. A solution to overcome the above complications is the development of logistics hubs as a means to simplify supply chain processes. Logistics hubs are generally defined as integrated centres for transhipment, storage, collection and distribution of goods (Jorgenson, 2007). Universally logistics hubs have intermodal or multi-modal solutions to abridge transportation difficulties and creating seamless movement of goods and in doing so optimising general operations. Freight shipments now have the ability to be consolidated at a central point and distributed from that point to its final destination. This creates added value for freight products. Customers now receive products at the right time, at the right place and in the right quantity, but with the benefit of paying less as a result of economies of scale created by the value added at the logistics hub. Logistics hubs are very well established internationally and many examples exist where these have been successfully built and implemented. This does not suggest that there is one specific recipe to success. Each region has its own demands which need to be satisfied. There are however numerous common characteristics which were identified {{during the course of the}} study.

40|$|International audienceSupply chain {{configuration}} {{has recently}} gained an increasing attention {{both from the}} practitioners' perspective and as a research area. This paper proposes an integrated model for designing and <b>optimising</b> international <b>logistics</b> networks. It consists of a mixed integer linear programming model and a data mapping section (i. e. methodological guidelines for gathering and processing the data necessary to set-up the model). It has been specifically developed for solving the configuration problem for supply chains characterised by a complexity level typical of real-life global logistics networks. Although this topic is well understood and well elaborated at a technical level in the extant literature, it still presents obstacles in practice {{especially in terms of}} dealing with real-life complexity, service level constraints and data mapping. Thus, we developed our integrated approach with the aim to fill these gaps. In details, we designed our model for dealing with multiple-layer, single location-layer, multiple-commodity and time-constrained logistics networks, to be implemented in a single period time horizon and in a deterministic environment. The proposed approach represents an innovative contribution to the existing body of scientific knowledge and it facilitates the data gathering and processing activities, which are largely recognised as complex and time consuming processes for the management of logistics activities...|$|R

The use of GIS represents {{one of the most effective}} technologies for the <b>optimising</b> of <b>logistics</b> and can improve efficiency of around 20 % (Frank 1999). But today's GIS still represent systems that can only be used by experienced users.

40|$|In recent years, {{rapid changes}} in markets {{including}} outsourcing and {{globalisation of trade}} and production systems {{have led to a}} dramatic upsurge of interest in retail logistics with the aim to minimise operational and logistics costs, improve responsiveness and ameliorate customer services. The notable massification and commodification of production and consumption have created structural changes in traditional urban distribution systems with the establishment of peripheral transshipment and hub systems. In the light of sustainable development, green logistics and transparency on emissions have become a further requirement conforming to the times with a special focus being placed on the logistics of collecting, processing and recycling waste materials. This has increased the need to develop more efficient and effective city distribution plans and to establish <b>optimised</b> <b>logistics</b> models which will integrate the delivery of materials and the collection of waste and returns in order to reduce congestion, costs and emissions. To this end, this thesis aims to investigate opportunities to improve existing delivery mechanisms in a dedicated shopping centre in the UK in order to minimise freight activity and emissions, while optimising the reverse flow system for product returns and waste. Using a substantial database of logistics operations compiled for 92 businesses in Southampton’s shopping centre, the study aimed to understand the current opportunities to better utilise the existing back-load capacity and assess the potential logistical and environmental savings that could arise from the use of a peripheral consolidation centre for core goods and waste. Following statistical analysis on WestQuay managers, logistics providers, waste contractors and head offices responses {{it was found that the}} fill rates of delivery vehicles were considerably low and therefore there was a great potential to increase back-load rates and consolidation among loads of different businesses. In examining the waste and return flows it was found that there were already centrally managed collections of general waste and some recyclables and therefore further opportunities to reduce the logistics and environmental impact would lie into the consolidation of forward traffic and the back-loading of specific waste streams such as hazardous materials. The examination however of specific case study examples exhibited the variety in the characteristics and properties of hazardous wastes and the role of material-specific legislation on the way different waste streams should be managed and disposed of which limited the collaboration opportunities among businesses producing different waste streams. Instead the study highlighted the considerable transport, environmental and economic gains that could be achieved by individual businesses through the use of regional waste contractors and recycling sites. With regard to the consolidation of forward flows, the study reviewed a number of existing consolidation schemes and their characteristics to identify potential strengths, weaknesses and risks that would impact on the operation of a consolidation centre in the outskirts of Southampton. Various scenarios regarding the operation of the consolidation scheme were examined considering different take up combinations among different vehicle modes and loads. The scenario analysis suggested that the establishment of the consolidation centre could offer great opportunities to reduce the overall urban freight activity, while mitigating the environmental impacts and cutting down the total costs to businesses...|$|R
40|$|The {{intermodal}} hinterland {{transportation of}} maritime containers is {{under pressure from}} port authorities and shippers to achieve a more integrated, efficient network operation. Current optimisation methods in literature yield limited results in practice, though, as the transportation product structure limits the flexibility to <b>optimise</b> network <b>logistics.</b> Synchromodality aims to overcome this by a new product structure based on differentiation in price and lead time. Each product is considered as a fare class with a related service level, allowing to target different customer segments and to use revenue management for maximising revenue. However, higher priced fare classes come with tighter planning restrictions and must be carefully balanced with lower priced fare classes to match available capacity and optimise network utilisation. Based on the developments of intermodal networks in North West European, such as the network of European Gateway Services, the Cargo Fare Class Mix problem is proposed. Its purpose is to set limits for each fare class at a tactical level, such that the expected revenue is maximised, considering the available capacity at the operational level. Setting limits at the tactical level is important, as it reflects the necessity of long-term agreements between the transportation provider and its customers. A solution method for an intermodal corridor is proposed, considering a single intermodal connection towards a region with multiple destinations. The main purpose of the article {{is to show that}} using a limit on each fare class increases revenue and reliability, thereby outperforming existing fare class mix policies, such as Littlewood. </p...|$|R

A simulation-based optimisation model is proposed to determine inventory control decisions. The results suggest that the PI inventory model, with greater agility and flexibility, outperforms the current classic inventory models in terms of resilience. Moreover, the difference in performance increases when the product value, penalty costs and disruption frequency increases.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{describe}} {{the history of the}} Swedish chlor-alkali industry. The chlor-alkali industry produces chlorine and alkali by electrolytic de-composition of ordinary salt solution (brine). This process generates chlorine and sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) in the fixed ratio 1 to 1. 13. Therefore, the chlor-alkali industry needs to balance its production so that these substances will be sup-plied in fixed proportions. This problem of balance also complicates the formation of chlorine and alkali. The Swedish chlor-alkali producers conducted collaboration in form of a mutual cartel between 1944 and 1993. One reason was to manage the problem of balance. Another was to regulate the sale and to form a larger market. Since it is difficult and dangerous to store and transport chlorine, there was also a desire to <b>optimise</b> the <b>logistics.</b> Mercury and asbestos have been widely used in the manufacture of chlorine. Chlorine has also been used to bleach pulp and to manufacture PVC. Hence, industrial production and use of chlorine is associated with multiple envi-ronmental problems. This thesis has been structured around three issues: balance problem; economical problems and cartel activities; and environmental problems. The primary informa-tion covers acts from business archives, special periodicals and official documents. Until the Second World War, Sweden had shortage of both chlorine and alkali. After the war there was relative good balance between production and consump-tion {{until the end of the}} 1950 s, but from 1961, Sweden has had a great shortage of sodium hydroxide. In general, Sweden has also had a surplus of chlorine, therefore, large quantities of chlorine were exported to East Germany between 1958 and 1990. The Swedish pulp and paper industry stopped using chlorine for bleaching in the beginning of the 1990 s, resulting in a sharp distortion of the chlor-alkali balance and closure of several Swedish chlor-alkali plants...|$|R

The distribution of goods based on road services in urban areas contribute to traffic congestion, generates environmental impacts and in some cases incurs in high logistics costs. On the other hand the various stakeholders involved in the applications may have possibly conflicting objectives. Industrial firms, shippers, freight carriers, have individually established to meet consumer demands looking to maximize the company effectiveness and as a consequence from a social point of view the resulting logistics system is inefficient {{from the point of view}} of the social costs and environmental impacts. As a consequence the design and evaluation of City Logistics applications requires an integrated framework in which all components could work together.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{logistics}} for locally produced food, and its integration with large-scale distribution systems, the conceptual idea of <b>optimised</b> and integrated <b>logistics</b> networks was analysed and demonstrated in a pilot project of local food producers in southern Sweden. The main objective {{of this paper was}} to assess the e-trade integrated logistics systems, economic benefits and environmental impact of integrated logistics systems, based on route optimisation analyses and producer data collected using questionnaires. The study revealed that the introduction of IT-systems for electronic trade had positive and negative economic effects. Internet-based cloud services designed for electronic business-to-business trading and coordinated transport with a common collection centre (CC) were important steps in the process of integration. The pilot project also showed the importance of a flexible organisation and a strong driving partner to con- tinue and develop collaboration. Route optimisation could reduce the route distances, decrease the environmental im- pact and provide economic benefits due to reduced working hours. The lowest estimated global warming potential from vehicle emissions was found when coordination was considered for collection to the CC and to and from the distribu- tion centre (DC). The lowest estimated potentials for acidification, eutrophication and human toxicity were found when integrated collections and deliveries took place during each route. To identify how the local food supply chains should be organised, more case studies of local food producers in different settings and under different conditions need to be carried out. With further case studies and surveys, more general patterns of variation and relations between variables may also be identified...|$|R
40|$|Oxfam runs {{a network}} of {{approximately}} 570 textile donation banks across the UK for second-hand textiles and books to raise revenue for good causes around the world. These banks are placed {{in a variety of}} public places, such as car parks (public and supermarket) and recycling centres. Of real interest is the impact the underlying population characteristics have on the yield volume and stock quality at the site, and whether a better understanding of this relationship can be gained using historic fill levels over time, and quality audits of the stock donated. If a relationship exists and different postcodes can be shown to yield significantly different weights and quality of stock then banks can be targeted to certain areas, and the <b>logistics</b> <b>optimised</b> accordingly. Using a database of Monthly (April 2010 – March 2011) collection records (weights of donations collected per bank) for around 500 textile banks, this paper investigates the relative impacts of certain factors (season, location, proximity to services and levels of affluence) in influencing the variability in observed banks weights across Oxfam’s charity banks in England. It also presents a model which can be used to predict the weights of donations that should be generated by a bank given the profile of the region. For each factor, a weighting coefficient was calculated to generate predicted weights for each bank. Data for 2009 - 2010 have also been used for analysis to understand seasonal and longer term trends. Data regarding the key factors used within the model have been derived from a range of sources (eg. Office for National Statistics). In order to identify whether areas with different demographic, geographical and economic characteristics, yield significantly different volumes of saleable stock, a range of donation stock quality audits are currently being undertaken at a range of locations around the country based on the outcomes of the analysis...|$|R
40|$|Keywords: Media asset {{management}} (MAM), maturity models, business process management (BPM), performance measurement, performance improvement, mixed methods research. Media {{asset management}} (MAM) {{is a key}} factor in efficient and effective marketing processes, which is why the market for media asset management is expected to grow tremendously in the future. In the meantime, best-in-class companies have centralised their access to all digital media assets to assure that all process members are able to benefit from media assets they are authorised to use. Modem information technology (IT) systems support the lifecycle of media assets. Marketing often entails performing a number of repetitive activities, thus forcing companies in this field to further increase their focus on business process management (BPM). The large amount of digital media files produced for all forms of communication can be traced back inter alia to the enormous relevance of social media. Media asset management systems (MAMSs) help organise and <b>optimise</b> media <b>logistics,</b> thereby yielding a very quick return on investment (ROI). As MAM is a relatively new topic, performance measurement systems in this area are underrepresented. Maturity models are used to measure, assess and optimise processes. They have high practical relevance. Over 100 different maturity models currently exist. They are used to compare best practices against real processes, to identify strengths and weaknesses as well as potential for optimisation and to provide advice on further steps. The research presented here develops and verifies a Media Asset Management Maturity Model (MAM 3) and is therefore situated directly at the interface between MAM and maturity models. Hence, the MAM 3 closes the gap described above. The model was developed and verified in a mixed methods approach. Initially it was built on basis of a broad literature review. Afterwards it was discussed with several experts with experience in the adjacent areas. Experts involved came from a software vendor, from large, globally operating companies that have used MAMSs for a long time, from consulting companies (inter alia top 5) or had an academic background. This procedure assured that the most relevant perceptions were considered. Changes based on this stage were later components of an in-depth quality assurance interview triangulation). Ultimately, the final model was tested in a quantitative survey with customers of a leading software vendor of MAMSs in Germany. One outcome was that all maturity categories established are positively related to performance in the area of media asset management. Furthermore the Media Asset Management Maturity Model has a high impact on management practice. Relevant variables that contribute to higher performance in the media asset management environment are decrypted and patterns are identified. The model offers the ability to guide managers through this complex topic and is a helpful instrument in the area of MAM. With a broader adoption in the future and the establishment of industry sector- and size-specific benchmarks, the benefits of using this tool will increase even moreEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|M. Comm. The South African {{economy is}} {{currently}} in a dynamic phase of change. In seeking a solution to rebuilding the economy and attaining a growth rate which is capable of creating jobs and sustaining economic development, it is widely recognized that a competitive platform needs to be created for a powerful expansion by the tradable goods sector. Many South African products cannot compete in international markets because of high unit costs and the consequential high prices offered to consumers. One of the primary reasons for product uncompetitiveness {{can be described as}} supply chain inefficiencies. q The supply chain is defined as the network of organisations that are involved in the various processes and activities that produce value in the form of products and services {{in the hands of the}} ultimate consumer. This study analyzes a single stand-alone component of the supply chain organisation, namely the public warehouse. The study recognizes that warehousing plays a vital role in enhancing end-user value by providing time and space utility and suggests that in order for the warehouse to fulfil a valueadding role, it must adjust its functioning to meet the supply chain's requirements. The study shows that conventional techniques are incorrectly focused and are thus inappropriate in an organisation aiming to achieve competitiveness and profitability, <b>optimise</b> the <b>logistics</b> trade-off between cost and quality and simultaneously supply the customer with a high level of service performance. The use of conventional costing and management techniques are shown to lead to the incorrect calculation and misallocation of costs which in turn result in inaccurate product (service) costing. This has made the public warehouse analyzed uncompetitive in the market and as a result unable to add any additional value to the customer. It is suggested that a completely new and differently focused system needs to be implemented if supply chain objectives are to be realised. It is suggested that activity-based management is capable of achieving supply chain goals. Activity-based management (ABM) is a system or discipline which focuses on the management of activities as the route to improving the value received by the customer and the profit achieved by providing this value. The study shows that ABM, as applied to the public warehouse, was able to achieve cost reductions, better and more effective management, enhanced strategic positioning, and, most importantly, competitiveness in the market place, a prerequisite for adding value to the supply chain. The study recognizes that supply chain management and activity-based management are relatively new fields of expertise, and that these are not yet recognized as a fully fledged profession in South Africa. Supply chain management needs to be established and promoted as a formal profession. Finally it is recognized that more research is necessary before ABM and supply chain management can become the standard in South African organisations. Information needs to be obtained regarding key South African performance indicators and information needs to be recognized as a strategic asset. Once this recognition is achieved strategic information plans can be designed and used to enhance the competitiveness of South African products...|$|R
