5|$|Mycenaean {{ships were}} shallow-draught vessels {{and could be}} beached on sandy bays. There were vessels of various sizes {{containing}} different numbers of oarsmen.

5|$|Of the ratings, 122 were Royal Marines. As an {{experiment}} during the ship's first commission, all <b>of</b> <b>Warriors</b> marines were from Royal Marine Artillery; subsequently some marine infantrymen were assigned {{as was the}} usual naval practice. The marines manned the aft section of guns and slung their hammocks between the crew's accommodation and the officers' cabins.|$|E
5|$|The Native Americans that {{attacked}} the group {{were not part}} of Black Hawk's band <b>of</b> <b>warriors</b> but they were en route to join that group when the massacre occurred. Older histories described the group as a band of Sac warriors while modern sources indicate that the band were associated with the Ho-Chunk nation. Black Hawk asserted that the group was Ho-Chunk and unaffiliated with his band in his autobiography.|$|E

5|$|Video game {{journalists have}} noted {{thematic}} {{similarities between the}} story details <b>of</b> <b>Warriors</b> of Rock and Brütal Legend, an action video game with a world based on heavy metal, developed by Tim Schafer and Double Fine Productions which Activision, at one point, would have published but later dropped the rights. Project lead Brian Bright commented that their inspiration for the game's story was the covers of metal albums, the same material {{that led to the}} world of Brütal Legend.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid was criticised for {{dressing}} his household and servants in clothing fit for royalty. He was accompanied on his travels by a retinue <b>of</b> <b>warriors,</b> one of whom, while at York, Wilfrid sent to abduct {{a young boy}} who had been promised to the church but whose family had changed their mind. Wilfrid also educated young men, both for clerical and secular careers.|$|E
5|$|According to Downham, the {{departure}} of Ragnall and his contingent <b>of</b> <b>warriors</b> may have emboldened Niall Glúndub to try to expel the Uí Ímair from Ireland once again. In 919 Niall led a coalition of northern Irish kings south to Dublin. The forces of Sitric and Niall met near Islandbridge in modern-day County Dublin (dated 14 September by the Annals of Ulster). The resulting Battle of Islandbridge was an overwhelming victory for Sitric and his forces, with Niall falling in battle alongside one of his kinsmen. Five other kings, and a kinsman of the ruler of the Southern Uí Néill also died fighting against Sitric's army.|$|E

5|$|Alboin's {{problems}} in maintaining {{control over his}} people worsened during the siege of Ticinum. The nature of the Lombard monarchy {{made it difficult for}} a ruler to exert the same degree of authority over his subjects as had been exercised by Theodoric over his Goths, and the structure of the army gave great authority to the military commanders or duces, who led each band (fara) <b>of</b> <b>warriors.</b> Additionally, the difficulties encountered by Alboin in building a solid political entity resulted from a lack of imperial legitimacy, as unlike the Ostrogoths, they had not entered Italy as foederati but as enemies of the Empire.|$|E
5|$|Figures for troops {{involved}} in ancient battles are often unreliable, and Cannae is no exception. They {{should be treated}} with caution, especially those for the Carthaginian side. The Carthaginian army was a combination <b>of</b> <b>warriors</b> from numerous regions, and may have numbered between 40,000-50,000. Along with the core of an estimated 8,000 Libyans, there were 8,000 Iberians, 16,000 Gauls (8,000 were left at camp the day of battle) and around 5,500 Gaetulian infantry. Hannibal's cavalry also came from diverse backgrounds. He commanded 4,000 Numidian, 2,000 Iberian, 4,000 Gallic and 450 Libyan-Phoenician cavalry. Finally, Hannibal had around 8,000 skirmishers consisting of Balearic slingers and mixed-nationality spearmen. The uniting factor for the Carthaginian army was the personal tie each group had with Hannibal.|$|E
5|$|First {{appearing}} in Dead 'Ard and Warrior, The Black Currant returned {{in a series}} of White Dwarf Thrud strips titled Thrud the Destroyer. In this story, The Black Currant is the leader of a horde <b>of</b> <b>warriors</b> who attack a small village, looting the homes, burning the women, raping the livestock and eating the babies. The Black Currant returned again in issue 3 of Critchlow's self-published Thrud the Barbarian comic as the leader of a group of bandits laying siege to a small town. The Black Currant is depicted in heavy black armour, wearing a helmet provided with a pair of exceedingly long, horizontally extending horns.|$|E

5|$|Freyja {{receives}} the slain {{heroes of the}} battlefield quite respectfully as Óðinn does. Her house is called Sessrumnir, 'filled with many seats', and it probably fills the same function as Valhöll, 'the hall of the slain', where the warriors eat and drink beer after the fighting. Still, we must ask why there are two heroic paradises in the Old Norse View of afterlife. It might possibly be a consequence of different forms of initiation <b>of</b> <b>warriors,</b> where one part seemed to have belonged to Óðinn {{and the other to}} Freyja. These examples indicate that Freyja was a war-goddess, and she even appears as a valkyrie, literally 'the one who chooses the slain'.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, the Mohave were {{composed}} of three geographical groups; Irataba was the hereditary {{leader of the}} Huttoh Pah group, who lived near the east bank of the Colorado River and occupied the central portion of the Mohave Valley. Mohave government consisted of a loose system of hereditary clan leaders with a head of the entire nation. They were often involved in conflicts with the Chemehuevi, Paiute, and Maricopa peoples. Irataba {{was a member of}} the Mohave warrior society called kwanami, who led groups <b>of</b> <b>warriors</b> in battle and were dedicated to defending their lands and people.|$|E
5|$|Japan's feudal era was {{characterized}} by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class <b>of</b> <b>warriors,</b> the samurai. In 1185, following {{the defeat of the}} Taira clan in the Genpei War, sung in the epic Tale of Heike, samurai Minamoto no Yoritomo was appointed shogun by Emperor Go-Toba, and Yoritomo established a base of power in Kamakura. After his death, the Hōjō clan came to power as regents for the shoguns. The Zen school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the Kamakura period (1185–1333) and became popular among the samurai class. The Kamakura shogunate repelled Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281, but was eventually overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo. Emperor Go-Daigo was himself defeated by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336.|$|E

5|$|On Carpenter's command, several massive volleys of aimed Spencer repeating rifles hit {{the front}} {{waves of the}} mounted Indians. The volleys {{decimated}} them as if hit by cannon filled with musket balls. A number <b>of</b> <b>warriors,</b> dismounted and using their ponies as bullet breaks, returned fire. Nearly all of these warriors died along with their ponies. Only three warriors made it to within fifty yards of the wagons before their demise. The Indians were so traumatized and demoralized by Carpenter's defense {{that they did not}} renew their attack.|$|E
5|$|Revanta was worshipped as {{guardian}} deity <b>of</b> <b>warriors</b> and horses, protector {{from the}} dangers of forests and the patron god of hunting. The worship of Revanta is closely associated with Saura, cult of Surya. Often, scriptures like Vishnudharmottara Purana and Kalika Purana recommend worship of Revanta alongside Surya or according to the rituals of Sun worship. Shabha-kalpa-druma records Revanta's worship after Surya's, in the Hindu month of Ashvin by warriors. Nakula, the fourth Pandava, {{is believed to have}} written Ashavashastram on horses. He suggests worship of Raivata to protect horses from ghosts.|$|E
5|$|Scattered evidence, {{including}} the records in Irish annals {{and the images}} <b>of</b> <b>warriors</b> like those depicted on the Pictish stone slabs at Aberlemno, Forfarshire and Hilton of Cadboll in Easter Ross, suggest that in Northern Britain, as in Anglo-Saxon England, society was dominated by a military aristocracy, whose status was dependent in a large part on their ability and willingness to fight. Below {{the level of the}} aristocracy it is assumed that there were non-noble freemen, working their own small farms or holding lands as free tenants. There are no surviving law codes from Scotland in this period, but codes in Ireland and Wales indicate that freemen had the right to bear arms, represent themselves in law and to receive compensation for murdered kinsmen.|$|E
