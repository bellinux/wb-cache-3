Three artists declined Bluitgen's proposal out <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> reprisals.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} {{eventually}} canceled by the Air Force in January 1959, seemingly out <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> a negative public reaction {{and the risk}} to the population should anything have gone wrong with the launch. Another factor, cited by project leader Leonard Reiffel, was the possible implications of the nuclear fallout for future lunar research projects and colonization.|$|E
5|$|A general {{mobilisation}} was {{not called}} until 3 April 1941, out <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> offending Adolf Hitler. By {{the time the}} invasion commenced, the 1st Cavalry Division had only begun mobilisation. According to the Yugoslav historian Velimir Terzić, on 6 April the mobilisation of the division was proceeding slowly due to the low number of conscripts that reported for duty, and the poor provision of animals and vehicles. A {{large portion of the}} strength of the division had been earmarked to be detached to one of the formations of the 4th Army, Detachment Ormozki.|$|E
40|$|Critics pay little {{attention}} to <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> death in Gulliver’s Travels. This paper aims {{to deal with the}} issue with Freud’s theory. According to Freud, <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> death results in death drive. In Gulliver’s Travels, the episodes of the Struldbruggs and the Houyhnhnms reveal <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> death. In the episode <b>of</b> Struldbruggs, <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> death is illustrated through <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> abandonment and <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> loss. <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> abandonment and <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> loss cause the Struldbruggs to long for physical death to end emotional death. In the episode <b>of</b> Houyhnhnms, <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> death is represented by <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> intimacy. <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> intimacy is expressed in Houyhnhnms’ cold attitudes to their friends and their family members...|$|R

5|$|Following {{the release}} <b>of</b> <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> Music in 1979, Talking Heads and Eno {{sought to make}} an album that would dispel notions of {{the group as a}} mere vehicle for {{frontman}} and chief lyricist David Byrne. Drawing on the influence of Nigerian musician Fela Kuti, the group experimented with African polyrhythms, funk, and electronics, recording instrumental tracks as a series of sampled and looped grooves, an innovative technique at the time. Recording sessions also incorporated a variety of side musicians, including guitarist Adrian Belew, singer Nona Hendryx, and trumpet player Jon Hassell.|$|E
5|$|In his 2005 and 2006 {{biographies of}} Druitt, D. J. Leighton {{concluded}} that Druitt was innocent, but repeated some of Knight's and Wilding's discredited claims. Leighton suggested that Druitt {{could have been}} murdered, either out of greed by his elder brother William or, as previously suggested by Howells and Skinner, out <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> exposure by Harry Wilson's homosexual cronies. The propensity of theorists to associate Ripper suspects with homosexuality has led scholars to assume that such notions are based on homophobia rather than evidence.|$|E
5|$|The {{supposed}} refusals {{from these}} first three artists to participate {{was seen as}} evidence of self-censorship out <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> violence from Islamists, which led to much debate in Denmark. The Danish news paper Politiken stated at February 12, 2006, that they asked Bluitgen {{to put them in}} touch with the artists, so the claim that none of them dared to work with him could be proved. The author refused, and nobody has ever been able to confirm whether the incident is properly described.|$|E

50|$|An {{evolutionary}} {{reason for}} the phobias remains unresolved. One view, especially held in evolutionary psychology, is {{that the presence of}} venomous spiders led to the evolution <b>of</b> a <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> spiders or made acquisition <b>of</b> a <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> spiders especially easy. Like all traits, there is variability in the intensity <b>of</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> spiders, and those with more intense fears are classified as phobic. Spiders, for instance, being relatively small, do not fit the usual criterion for a threat in the animal kingdom where size is a factor, but they can be venomous.|$|R
5|$|Tianshun {{proved to}} be a troubled time and Mongol forces within the Ming {{military}} structure continued to be problematic. On 7 August 1461, the Chinese general Cao Qin and his Ming troops of Mongol descent staged a coup against the Tianshun Emperor out <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> being next on his purge-list of those who aided him in the Wresting the Gate Incident. Cao's rebel force managed to set fire to the western and eastern gates of the Imperial City (doused by rain during the battle) and killed several leading ministers before his forces were finally cornered and he was forced to commit suicide.|$|E

5|$|After unrelenting {{political}} pressure from Adolf Hitler, Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact on 25 March 1941. On 27 March, {{a military coup}} d'état overthrew the government that had signed the pact, and a new government was formed under {{the commander of the}} VVKJ, Armijski đeneral Dušan Simović. A general mobilisation was not initiated by the new government until 3 April 1941, out <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> offending Hitler and thus precipitating war. However, on the same day as the coup, Hitler issued Führer Directive 25 which called for Yugoslavia to be treated as a hostile state, and on 3 April, Führer Directive 26 was issued, detailing the plan of attack and command structure for the German-led Axis invasion.|$|E

It might truly {{be said of}} him, as for many journalists in authority, that his most familiar emotion was one <b>of</b> continuous fear; <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> libel actions, <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> lost advertisements, <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> misprints, <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> the sack.|$|R

5|$|Kane {{opened at}} the RKO Palace Theatre on Broadway in New York on May 1, 1941, in Chicago on May 6, and in Los Angeles on May 8. Welles said that at the Chicago premiere that he {{attended}} the theater was almost empty. It did well in cities and larger towns but fared poorly in more remote areas. RKO still had problems getting exhibitors to show the film. For example, one chain controlling more than 500 theaters got Welles's film {{as part of a}} package but refused to play it, reportedly out <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> Hearst. Hearst's disruption of the film's release damaged its box office performance and, as a result, it lost $160,000 during its initial run. The film earned $23,878 during its first week in New York. By the ninth week it only made $7,279. Overall it lost money in New York, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., but made a profit in Seattle.|$|E

5|$|News of the {{encounter}} was conveyed back to France, but the country was {{at this time in}} one of the most turbulent eras of the ongoing Revolution and little notice was taken of events in India. Historian William James notes that under normal political circumstances the action would have had more significant ramifications, while Edward Pelham Brenton claims that the French deliberately ignored the report out <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> antagonising Britain. In Britain, the Admiralty approved of Cornwallis' actions, suggesting that the French were deliberately using the guise of trade to support Mysore against Britain. The action had no effect on the ongoing war in India, which was now centred on the inland city of Seringapatam. As British forces closed on the city in February 1792, the Tipu Sultan initiated peace talks which brought the war to an end in exchange for concessions to the Company and its Indian allies.|$|E
5|$|The Vidiians' culture also shifts as {{a result}} of the Phage. In Vidiian society, an {{individual}} would hire a specialist, or a honatta, to find the required organs or tissues. Extended periods of contact or group meetings are strongly discouraged to prevent the further spread of the Phage, and those infected are shunned by healthy Vidiians out <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> contamination. The Vidiians also capture other species to work for them as slaves doing manual tasks, such as mining. In the years following Voyager encounters with the Vidiians but prior to their return to Earth, a committee of alien intellectuals known as the Think Tank claimed to have cured the Phage.|$|E
5|$|The {{agricultural}} sector continued to perform poorly and by Brezhnev's final year, food shortages were reaching disturbing levels of frequency. Particularly embarrassing {{to the regime}} {{was the fact that}} even bread had become rationed, one commodity that they always prided themselves on being available. One reason for this was excessive consumer demand as food prices remained artificially low while incomes had trebled over the last 20 years. Despite the miserable failure of collective farming, the Soviet government remained committed to reducing imports of foodstuffs from the West even though they cost less than domestic production, not only for reasons of national pride, but out <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> becoming dependent on capitalist countries for basic necessities.|$|E

Marin Barleti claims that Murad died of disease under the fortress of Krujë, but Murad in fact died in Edirne in 1451. Murad began {{to retire from}} Albania out <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> losing even more men from the Albanian winter, however the retreat itself caused the loss of thousands of Ottoman troops due to attacks from local Albanian militias. Skanderbeg {{was at the end}} of his resources. He travelled to Ragusa, urging for assistance, and the Ragusans informed Pope Nicholas V. Through financial assistance, Skanderbeg managed to hold Krujë and regain much of his territory. Skanderbeg's success brought praise from all over Europe and ambassadors were sent to him from Rome, Naples, Hungary, and Burgundy. Skanderbeg then became a vassal of Alfonso V, on March 26, 1451, by the Treaty of Gaeta, gaining much needed men and supplies from the crown of Aragon.|$|E

During the campaign, many MDC supporters had remained quiet about their views out <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> reprisals. The MDC was also negatively impacted by its time in coalition government, with perceptions {{that it had been}} just as corrupt as ZANU-PF.

In addition, the correlation level between different raters {{in the assessment}} <b>of</b> student <b>fears</b> and related anxieties were examined. Data were collected from public schools and evaluated using Multivariate Analysis of Variance, Analysis of Variance, slice effect test, frequency analysis, and Pearson Product Moment Correlation. Findings {{from the present study}} indicated that students with learning disabilities (LD) reported significantly higher total fear score and higher levels <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> in the two factors <b>of</b> the <b>Fear</b> Survey Schedule for Children-Revised (FSSC-R) : <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> failure and criticism and <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> danger and death. In addition, the LD group reported significantly higher overall anxiety level and higher levels of anxiety in all the three subscale scores of Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS). Results showed that girls reported significantly higher scores than did boys in total <b>fear</b> score, intensity <b>of</b> <b>fears,</b> and two factors <b>of</b> FSSC-R [...] <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> unknown and <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> injury and small animals. Furthermore, girls in the LD group reported higher total <b>fear</b> score, intensity <b>of</b> <b>fears,</b> and higher levels <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> in all the five factors of FSSC-R than their male counterparts in the same group. On the other hand, girls in the mild mental retardation (MIMR) group reported lower scores in these measures than did their boy counterparts in the same group. Regarding age differences, older students reported significantly higher scores in the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> failure and criticism. In addition, older students in the MIMR group reported higher levels <b>of</b> total <b>fear</b> score, intensity <b>of</b> <b>fears,</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> the unknown, <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> danger and death, and <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> failure and criticism than their younger counterparts. The 10 most common fears yielded from the Fear Survey Schedule for Children-Revised were mostly in the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> danger and death factor.
