40|$|One of {{the major}} {{mechanisms}} of chemical protection against carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, {{and other forms of}} toxicity mediated by electrophiles is the induction of enzymes involved in their metabolism, particularly phase 2 enzymes such as glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases, and NAD(P) H:quinone reductase. Furthermore, induction of phase 2 enzymes appears to be a sufficient condition for obtaining chemoprevention and can be achieved in many target tissues by administering any of a diverse array of naturally occurring and synthetic chemical agents. One class of chemopreventive agents, 1, 2 -dithiole- 3 -thiones, was developed {{on the basis of their}} potent activity in rodent tissues as inducers of GSTs. A substituted dithiolethione, <b>oltipraz</b> [4 -methyl- 5 -(2 -pyrazinyl) - 1, 2 -dithiole- 3 -thione], is an effective inhibitor of aflatoxin B 1 -mediated hepatocarcinogenesis in the rat. <b>Oltipraz</b> produces dramatic decreases in the levels of aflatoxin-DNA adducts in the liver as well as in the urinary levels of the depurination product aflatoxin-N 7 -guanine. Corresponding increases are seen in the biliary elimination of aflatoxin-glutathione conjugates. Administration of <b>oltipraz</b> results in 3 - to 4 -fold increases in hepatic cytosolic GST activities and mRNA levels for some alpha, mu and pi isoforms. Nuclear run-on assays have indicated that <b>oltipraz</b> treatment elevates rates of transcription of some GST subunits.

In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase IIa chemoprevention trial, we tested <b>oltipraz,</b> an antischistosomal drug that {{has been shown to be}} a potent and effective inhibitor of aflatoxin-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in animal models. Methods: In 1995, 234 adults from Qidong were enrolled. Healthy eligible individuals were randomly assigned to receive by mouth 125 mg <b>oltipraz</b> daily, 500 mg <b>oltipraz</b> weekly, or a placebo. Sequential immunoaffinity chromatography and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry or to fluorescence detection were used to identify and quantify phase 1 and phase 2 metabolites of aflatoxin B 1 in the urine of study participants. Reported P values are two-sided. Results: One month of weekly administration of 500 mg <b>oltipraz</b> led to a 51 % decrease in median levels of the phase 1 metabolite aflatoxin M 1 excreted in urine compared with administration of a placebo (P =. 030), but it had no effect on levels of a phase 2 metabolite, aflatoxin–mercapturic acid (P =. 871). By contrast, daily intervention with 125 mg <b>oltipraz</b> led to a 2. 6 -fold increase in median aflatoxin–mercapturic acid excretion (P =. 017) but had no effect on excreted aflatoxin M 1 levels (P =. 682). Conclusions: Intermittent, high-dose <b>oltipraz</b> inhibited phase 1 activation of aflatoxins, and sustained low-dose <b>oltipraz</b> increased phase 2 conjugation of aflatoxin, yielding higher levels of aflatoxin–mercapturic acid.

An increase of CYP 2 B 6 mRNA is observed after a 4 h exposure and maximum induction is reached after 24 h. The rapid induction of CYP 2 B 6 mRNA in oltipraz-treated cells suggests a transcriptional activation of corresponding gene. To test this hypothesis, we performed transient transfections with constructs containing the CYP 2 B 6 gene 5 '-flanking region upstream of the luciferase gene in order to measure the transcriptional activity of CYP 2 B 6 gene in human hepatoma HepG 2 cells, in absence or presence of <b>oltipraz.</b> The results demonstrate that transcriptional activation of CYP 2 B 6 gene is mediated mainly by the pregnane X receptor (PXR) and the Phenobarbital Responsive Element Module (PBREM). The nuclear factor-erythroid 2 -related factor 2 (Nrf 2) and an antioxidant responsive element (ARE), located upstream the PBREM, might also have a role in this activation but their involvement remains unclear.

40|$|Induction {{of phase}} 2 enzymes, which {{neutralize}} reactive electrophiles {{and act as}} indirect antioxidants, {{appears to be an}} effective means for achieving protection against a variety of carcinogens in animals and humans. Transcriptional control of the expression of these enzymes is mediated, at least in part, through the antioxidant response element (ARE) found in the regulatory regions of their genes. The transcription factor Nrf 2, which binds to the ARE, appears to be essential for the induction of prototypical phase 2 enzymes such as glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and NAD(P) H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO 1). Constitutive hepatic and gastric activities of GST and NQO 1 were reduced by 50 – 80 % in nrf 2 -deficient mice compared with wild-type mice. Moreover, the 2 - to 5 -fold induction of these enzymes in wild-type mice by the chemoprotective agent <b>oltipraz,</b> which is currently in clinical trials, was almost completely abrogated in the nrf 2 -deficient mice.

The stability of the susceptibility of progeny F 1 4 did not change in relation to generations F 1 to F 5; the progeny was resistant to hycanthone and oxamniquine; but sensitive to niridazole, praziquantel and Olti-praz. We emphasize the importance of the phenomenon of resistance of the worm {{in view of the fact}} that oxamniquine has been widely used in Brazilian areas where mansonic schistosomiasis is endemic...|$|E
40|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to mutagenic substances is {{strongly associated with}} an individual's risk of developing colorectal cancer. Clinical investigation of <b>oltipraz</b> as a chemopreventive agent is supported by its induction of the expression of detoxication enzymes in various tissues, and its protective activity against the formation of chemically induced colorectal tumors in animals. The goals {{of the present study}} were: to determine if <b>oltipraz</b> could induce detoxicating gene expression in human tissues; to identify effective non-toxic doses for more extensive clinical testing; and to establish a relationship between effects in the colon mucosa and those in a more readily available tissue, the peripheral mononuclear cell. 24 evaluable patients at high risk for colorectal cancer were treated in a dose-finding study with <b>oltipraz</b> 125, 250, 500, or 1, 000 mg/m 2 as a single oral dose. Biochemical analysis of sequential blood samples and colon mucosal biopsies revealed increases in glutathione transferase activity at the lower dose levels. These effects were not observed at the higher doses. More pronounced changes were observed in detoxicating enzyme gene expression in both tissues at all doses. Peripheral mononuclear cell and colon mRNA content for gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) and DT-diaphorase increased after dosing to reach a peak on day 2 - 4 after treatment, and declined to baseline in the subsequent 7 - 10 d. The extent of induction of gene expression in colon mucosa reached a peak of 5. 75 -fold for gamma-GCS, and a peak of 4. 14 -fold for DT-diaphorase at 250 mg/m 2; higher doses were not more effective. Levels of gamma-GCS and DT-diaphorase correlated closely (P < or = 0. 001) between peripheral mononuclear cells and colon mucosa both at baseline and at peak. These findings demonstrate that the administration of minimally toxic agents at low doses may modulate the expression of detoxicating genes in the tissues of individuals at high risk for cancer. Furthermore, peripheral mononuclear cells may be used as a noninvasive surrogate endpoint biomarker for the transcriptional response of normal colon mucosa to drug administration...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{mechanisms}} of protection against carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, {{and other forms of}} toxicity mediated by carcinogens is the induction of enzymes involved in their metabolism, particularly phase 2 enzymes such as glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), UDP-glucuronosyl transferases, and quinone reductases. Animal studies indicate that induction of phase 2 enzymes is a sufficient condition for obtaining chemoprevention and can be achieved by administering any of a diverse array of naturally-occurring and synthetic chemopreventive agents. Indeed, monitoring of enzyme induction has led to the recognition or isolation of novel, potent chemopreventive agents such as 1, 2 -dithiole- 3 -thiones, terpenoids and the isoth-iocyanate sulforaphane. For example, <b>oltipraz,</b> a substituted 1, 2 -dithiole- 3 -thione originally developed as an antischistosomal agent, possesses chemopreventive activity against different classes of carcinogens targeting multiple organs. Mechanistic studies in rodent models for chemoprevention of aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) -induced hepatocarcinogenesis by <b>oltipraz</b> indicates that increased expression of phase 2 genes is of central importance, although inhibition of phase 1 activation of AFB 1 can also contribute to protection. Exposure of rodents to 1, 2 -dithiole- 3 -thiones triggers nuclear accumulation of the transcription factor Nrf 2 and its enhanced binding to the “antioxidant response element ” (ARE), leading to transcriptional activation of a score of genes involved in carcinogen detoxication and attenuation of oxidative stress. Nrf 2 -deficient mice fail to induce many of these genes in response to dithiolethiones; moreover, basal expression of these genes is typically repressed. To test the hypothesis tha...|$|E
40|$|Seventy three {{children}} (6 - 15 years) and 75 adults (18 - 47 years) with active schistosomiasis mansoni {{were treated with}} <b>oltipraz.</b> All cases had at least 100 eggs per gram of feces {{as determined by the}} Kato-Katz technique. Children and adults were divided in two groups receiving respectively 25 or 30 mg/kg, as a single oral dose. Clinical examination, laboratories tests (haemogram, urinalysis, hepatic and kidney functions tests, glycemia, cholesterol, triglicerides, lipoprotein — HLD and LDL) and ECG were performed before, 3 or 7 days and 1 month after treatment. Parasitological control with 3 daily coprological examinations, was done on the 1 st, 3 rd j 6 th month after drug administration. Giddiness, somnolence, headache, nausea, vomiting and abdominal distress were the most frequent side effects. Pain in the finger tips that need further investigations also occurred. No significant alteration in complementary tests were observed, whereas eosinophilia 1 month after treatment was detected, probably indicating worm death. The cure rate in children was 81. 8 % and 74. 2 % with 25 and 30 mg/kg respectively, and in adults 75. 0 % and 81. 2 % of the patients. No statistical significant difference was observed between cure rate and side effects at different dosages employed, neither between adults nor children. In all groups the percentage of egg reduction in feces in the non cured patients was higher than 96. 0 %.

Following seven daily doses (i. g.), all compounds except 2 -methylselenazolidine- 4 (R) -carboxylic acid (MSCA) increased thioredoxin reductase activity (43 – 92 %) but only for 2 -oxoselenazolidine- 4 (R) -carboxylic acid (OSCA) was there an accompanying increase in mRNA. No compound enhanced glutathione peroxidase activity, although sodium selenite significantly elevated the mRNA of this enzyme. <b>Oltipraz</b> was an efficacious inducer of both thioredoxin reductase and glutathione peroxidase mRNAs. Sodium selenite, selenazolidine- 4 (R) -carboxylic acid (SCA), and OSCA elevated NAD(P) H-quinone oxidoreductase mRNA but only for OSCA was the elevation in mRNA accompanied by an increase in enzyme activity. l-Selenocystine significantly increased this activity without increasing mRNA levels. Sodium selenite, l-selenocystine, l-selenomethionine, and Se-methyl-l-selenocysteine all enhanced glutathione S-transferase activity. The increased activity with sodium selenite was accompanied by increases in mRNAs of Gst �, Gst � and Gst � classes, while for l-selenocystine and Se-methyl-l-selenocysteine, only an elevation in the mRNA for the Gst � class was observed.

40|$|A {{review of}} almost 2000 {{studies showed that}} the large {{majority}} of 39 putative cancer chemopreventive agents induced "spontaneous" apoptosis. Inhibition of the programmed cell death triggered by a variety of stimuli was consistently reported only with ascorbic acid, alpha-tocopherol, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC). We performed experimental studies in rodents exposed to cigarette smoke, either mainstream (MCS) or environmental (ECS), and UV-A/B-containing light. The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug sulindac did not affect the apoptotic process in the skin of light-exposed mice and in the lungs of ECS-exposed mice. Likewise, 5, 6 -benzoflavone, indole- 3 -carbinol, 1, 2 -dithiole- 3 -thione and <b>oltipraz</b> failed to modulate apoptosis in the respiratory tract of ECS-exposed rats. Phenethyl isothiocyanate further enhanced the frequency of apoptosis in pulmonary alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells, and upregulated several genes in the lung of ECS-exposed rats. Both individually and in combination with <b>oltipraz,</b> NAC inhibited apoptosis in the respiratory tract of rats exposed either to MCS or ECS. Moreover, NAC attenuated the ECS-related overexpression of proapoptotic genes and normalized the levels of proapoptotic proteins in rat lung. The transplacental administration of NAC to mice considerably attenuated gene overexpression in the liver of fetuses exposed to ECS throughout pregnancy. Inhibition of apoptosis by chemopreventive agents reflects their ability to counteract certain upstream signals, such as genotoxic damage, redox imbalances, and other forms of cellular stress that trigger apoptosis. On the other hand, enhancement of apoptosis is a double-edged sword, since it represents a protective mechanism in carcinogenesis but may contribute to the pathogenesis of other degenerative diseases. We suggest that stimulation of apoptosis by so many chemopreventive agents, as reported in the literature, may often reflect the occurrence of toxic effects at high doses...|$|E
40|$|Multidrug {{resistance}} protein 4 (MRP 4; ABCC 4) is an ATP binding cassette transporter {{that facilitates}} the excretion of bile salt conjugates and other conjugated steroids in hepatocytes and renal proximal tubule epithelium. MRP 4 /Mrp 4 undergoes adaptive upregulation {{in response to}} oxidative and cholestatic liver injury in human and animal models of cholestasis. However, the molecular mechanism of this regulation remains to be determined. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and NF-E 2 -related factor 2 (Nrf 2) play important roles in protecting cells from oxidative stress. Here we examine the role of these two nuclear factors in the regulation of the expression of human MRP 4. HepG 2 cells and human hepatocytes were treated with the AhR and Nrf 2 activators, 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), 3 -methylcholanthrene (3 -MC), or <b>oltipraz</b> and other nuclear receptor agonists. TCDD, 3 -MC, and <b>oltipraz</b> significantly increased MRP 4 expression at mRNA and protein levels. Computer program analysis revealed three Xenobiotic response element (XRE) and one Maf response element sites within the first 500 bp of the MRP 4 proximal promoter. Luciferase reporter assay detected strong promoter activity (53 -fold higher than vector control) in this region. TCDD and 3 -MC also induced promoter activity in the reporter assays. Mutation {{of any of these}} XRE sites significantly decreased MRP 4 promoter activity in reporter assays, although XRE 2 demonstrated the strongest effects on both basal and TCDD-inducible activity. EMSA and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further confirmed that both AhR and Nrf 2 bind to the proximal promoter of MRP 4. Our findings indicate that AhR and Nrf 2 play important roles in regulating MRP 4 expression and suggest that agents that activate their activity may be of therapeutic benefit for cholestasis...|$|E

Scientists are working on ways to keep the deadly toxin out of the food supply. Two techniques under development identify aflatoxin-tainted corn by using infrared light to elicit telltale sounds and light from contaminated kernels.
