5|$|CryoSat-2 {{was built}} as a {{replacement}} for CryoSat-1, whose Rokot carrier rocket was unable to achieve orbit, resulting in the loss of the satellite. Compared to its predecessor, CryoSat-2 features software upgrades, greater battery capacity and an updated instrument package. Its main instrument is an interferometric radar range-finder with twin antennas, which measures the height difference between the upper surface <b>of</b> <b>floating</b> ice and surrounding water. This is often known as 'free-board'.|$|E
5|$|In September, {{as part of}} her {{opening speech}} for the 66th United Nations Debate, and also in an article for the Financial Times, Brazilian {{president}} Dilma Rousseff called for the currency war to be ended by increased use <b>of</b> <b>floating</b> currencies and greater cooperation and solidarity among major economies, with exchange rate policies set for the good of all rather than having individual nations striving to gain an advantage for themselves.|$|E
5|$|The {{blood that}} spurts {{out of the}} Klingon's wounds was created using {{computer}} generated imagery; the animators {{had to make sure}} that the blood floated in a convincing manner while still looking interesting and not too gory. The effects artist looked at NASA footage <b>of</b> <b>floating</b> globules of water to inform the physics of the blood particles. Initially, the blood was to be colored green, but the filmmakers realized that McCoy had referred to Spock as green-blooded.|$|E
50|$|Wiplinger {{was an avid}} {{floatplane}} pilot, and he {{was familiar}} with the dominant line <b>of</b> light-aircraft <b>floats</b> <b>of</b> the era, EDO. He sought an EDO dealership, but was turned down. He determined to fabricate his own line <b>of</b> aircraft <b>floats,</b> and that activity soon became the company's (at the time called Wipline, Inc.) main focus. The production <b>of</b> Wipline <b>floats</b> commened in 1960, though the first set wasn't sold until 1962. By 2013 the company had delivered over 2000 sets <b>of</b> <b>floats,</b> ranging in capacity from Cubs to Twin Otters. However, along with the manufacture and installation <b>of</b> <b>floats,</b> the company gradually returned to its original role of aircraft servicing, maintenance, modifications, painting and interior completions.|$|R

5|$|Melting <b>of</b> <b>floating</b> {{ice shelves}} (ice that {{originated}} on the land) {{does not in}} itself contribute much to sea-level rise (since the ice displaces only its own mass of water). However it is the outflow of the ice from the land to form the ice shelf which causes a rise in global sea level. This effect is offset by snow falling back onto the continent. Recent decades have witnessed several dramatic collapses of large ice shelves around the coast of Antarctica, especially along the Antarctic Peninsula. Concerns have been raised that disruption of ice shelves may result in increased glacial outflow from the continental ice mass.|$|E
5|$|The {{fictional world}} of Blue Wing Blitz is {{composed}} <b>of</b> <b>floating</b> islands, and usage of aircraft is widespread. Most {{of the islands}} are owned and ruled by the expansionist Ordia Empire, which possess superior aircraft. One of the independent states is the Esk Republic, a rich agrarian nation which supplies food to other countries, such as the United Federation of Roggina or the Kingdoms of Mackai and Peag. At {{the beginning of the}} game, Trund, the Prime Minister of Esk, assembles a rebel force to reclaim territories menaced by Ordia.|$|E
5|$|The {{harmonium}} {{was out of}} {{tune with}} everything. It wasn't even in tune with itself. She insisted on playing it on everything {{so we had to}} figure out ways to separate her voice from it as much as possible and then find instrumental voices that would be compatible with the harmonium track... As an arranger you're usually trying to take the songs and put a structure on them, but what I thought was valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left you with a sort <b>of</b> <b>floating</b> free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became more abstract.|$|E

5|$|It {{was clear}} from the {{beginning}} of the CryoSat programme that an extensive series of measurements would be needed, both to understand interaction of the radar waves with the surface of the ice caps and to relate the measured freeboard <b>of</b> <b>floating</b> sea ice with its thickness. This latter, in particular, would have to take account of snow loading. For sea ice, which moves as it is blown by the wind, it was also necessary to develop techniques which could give consistent results when measured from platforms travelling at different speed (scientists on the surface, helicopter-towed sounders, aircraft-borne radars and CryoSat itself). A number of campaigns were performed under a programme called CRYOVEX which aimed to address each of the identified areas of uncertainty. These campaigns continued through the development of the original CryoSat and were planned to continue after its launch.|$|E
5|$|Other {{rationales}} {{for the failure}} of the forward rate unbiasedness hypothesis include considering the conditional bias to be an exogenous variable explained by a policy aimed at smoothing interest rates and stabilizing exchange rates, or considering that an economy allowing for discrete changes could facilitate excess returns in the forward market. Some researchers have contested empirical failures of the hypothesis and have sought to explain conflicting evidence as resulting from contaminated data and even inappropriate selections of the time length of forward contracts. Economists demonstrated that the forward rate could serve as a useful proxy for future spot exchange rates between currencies with liquidity premia that average out to zero during the onset <b>of</b> <b>floating</b> exchange rate regimes in the 1970s. Research examining the introduction of endogenous breaks to test the structural stability of cointegrated spot and forward exchange rate time series have found some evidence to support forward rate unbiasedness in both the short and long term.|$|E
5|$|Salanoia durrelli {{has been}} {{recorded}} at Andreba, a marshy area at 750m (2460ft) above sea level on the eastern coast of Lac Alaotra. The nearest occurrence of the brown-tailed mongoose is about 55km (35mi) from Alaotra. The first observed specimen was swimming; it may have fled from human activity on the shore. The two others were caught on mats <b>of</b> <b>floating</b> vegetation. Thus, S.durrelli occurs in a marsh habitatâ€”quite different from the forest-dwelling brown-tailed mongoose. S.durrelli may use its robust dentition to feed on prey with hard parts, such as crustaceans and molluscs, in addition to small vertebrates, rather than the insects that the more gracile-toothed brown-tailed mongoose eats. Indeed, the two specimens of S.durrelli were captured using traps baited with fish and meat. S.durrelli is similar in many respects to the larger mainland African marsh mongoose (Atilax paludinosa), a carnivorous wetland-dweller that also uses mats of vegetation to eat and sleep on.|$|E

5|$|The realistic-looking {{effects of}} the astronauts {{floating}} weightless in space and inside the spacecraft were accomplished by suspending the actors from wires attached {{to the top of}} the set, and placing the camera underneath them. The actors' bodies blocked the camera's view of the suspension wires, creating a very believable appearance <b>of</b> <b>floating.</b> For the shot of Poole floating into the pod's arms during Bowman's rescue attempt, a stuntman replaced a dummy on the wire to realistically portray the movements of an unconscious human, and was shot in slow motion to enhance the illusion of drifting through space. The scene showing Bowman entering the emergency airlock from the E.V.A. pod was done in a similar way: an off-camera stagehand, standing on a platform, held the wire suspending Dullea above the camera positioned at the bottom of the vertically configured airlock. At the proper moment, the stagehand first loosened his grip on the wire, causing Dullea to fall toward the camera, then, while holding the wire firmly, he jumped off the platform, causing Dullea to ascend back up toward the hatch.|$|E
5|$|Titan uses Jaguar's 200 cabinets, {{covering}} 404 square meters (4,352 ft2), with replaced internals and upgraded networking. Reusing Jaguar's {{power and}} cooling systems saved approximately $20 million. Power is provided to each cabinet at three-phase 480 V. This requires thinner cables than the US standard 208 V, saving $1 million in copper. At its peak, Titan draws 8.2 MW, 1.2 MW more than Jaguar, but runs almost {{ten times as}} fast in terms <b>of</b> <b>floating</b> point calculations. In {{the event of a}} power failure, carbon fiber flywheel power storage can keep the networking and storage infrastructure running for up to 16 seconds. After 2 seconds without power, diesel generators fire up, taking approximately 7 seconds to reach full power. They can provide power indefinitely. The generators are designed only to keep the networking and storage components powered so that a reboot is much quicker; the generators are not capable of powering the processing infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|The special {{visual effects}} for Raiders were {{provided}} by Industrial Light & Magic and include: a matte shot to establish the Pan Am flying boat {{in the water and}} miniature work to show the plane taking off and flying, superimposed over a map; animation effects for the beam in the Tanis map room; and a miniature car and passengers superimposed over a matte painting for a shot of a Nazi car being forced off a cliff. The bulk of effects shots were featured in the climactic sequence wherein the Ark of the Covenant (which was designed by Brian Muir and Keith Short) is opened and God's wrath is unleashed. This sequence featured animation, a woman to portray a beautiful spirit's face, rod puppet spirits moved through water to convey a sense <b>of</b> <b>floating,</b> a matte painting of the island, and cloud tank effects to portray clouds. The melting of Toht's head was done by exposing a gelatine and plaster model of Ronald Lacey's head to a heat lamp with an under-cranked camera, while Dietrich's crushed head was a hollow model from which air was withdrawn. When the film was originally submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America, it received an R rating because of the scene in which Belloq's head explodes. The filmmakers were able to receive a PG rating when they added a veil of fire over the exploding head scene. (PG-13 rating was not created until 1984.) The firestorm that cleanses the canyon at the finish was a miniature canyon filmed upside down.|$|E
