5|$|The 1973 war {{convinced}} the Israelis {{of the necessity}} of negotiations with the Arabs. This unprecedented willingness, coupled with Sadat's diplomatic initiatives and intercession by the United States to break barriers <b>of</b> <b>mistrust</b> between Egypt and Israel, made possible the long series of discussions between both nations. The negotiations ultimately resulted in the 1978 Camp David Agreements, and the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel in 1979. Thus, without resorting to another major war, Sadat had been able to regain the Sinai through diplomatic means.|$|E
5|$|Asad was apprised {{of this on}} {{the evening}} of 7 December, when {{messages}} arrived at Balkh that the Turgesh and their allies, some 30,000 strong, were at Jazza. Asad ordered signal fires to be lit and mobilized his Syrian troops, although he had to pay each man twenty dirhams to persuade them to fight. The Umayyad governor initially refused to call upon the help of the local Khurasani Arabs, indicating the level <b>of</b> <b>mistrust</b> existing by now between the latter and the representatives of the Umayyad regime; in the end, however, he relented, and gathered a force of 7,000 men. In the meantime, Suluk attacked Khulm, but after being repelled marched on to Peroz Nakhsher/Peroz Bakhshin. Bypassing Balkh, the Turgesh seized the capital of Juzjan, and then dispersed and sent out mounted raiding parties in all directions, with some reaching as far as Marw al-Rudh. This was possibly done in search of forage, since such a large army could not otherwise be sustained during the winter. Against the expectations of Ibn Surayj, however, the ruler of Juzjan elected to side with Asad, who, informed of these events by the governor of Khulm, set out to engage the Turgesh.|$|E
5|$|Khalid's {{strategy}} of {{withdrawing from the}} occupied areas and concentrating all of his troops for a decisive battle forced the Byzantines to concentrate their five armies in response. The Byzantines had for centuries avoided engaging in large-scale decisive battles, and the concentration of their forces created logistical strains for which the empire was ill-prepared. Damascus was the closest logistical base, but Mansur, leader of Damascus, could not fully supply the massive Byzantine army that was gathered at the Yarmouk plain. Several clashes were reported with local citizens over supply requisition, as summer was at an end {{and there was a}} decline of pasturage. Greek court sources accused Vahan of treason for his disobedience to Heraclius' command not to engage in large-scale battle with Arabs. Given the massing of the Muslim armies at Yarmouk, however, Vahan {{had little choice but to}} respond in kind. Relations between the various Byzantine commanders were also fraught with tension. There was a struggle for power between Trithurios and Vahan, Jarajis, and Qanatir (Buccinator). Jabalah, the Christian Arab leader, was largely ignored, to the detriment of the Byzantines given his knowledge of the local terrain. An atmosphere <b>of</b> <b>mistrust</b> thus existed between the Romans, Greeks, Armenians, and Arabs. Longstanding ecclesiastical feuds between the Monophysite and Chalcedonian factions, while of negligible direct impact, certainly inflamed underlying tensions. The effect of these feuds was decreased coordination and planning, one of the reasons for the catastrophic Byzantine defeat.|$|E

25|$|Peter V. Verigin {{was killed}} in a bomb {{explosion}} on October 29, 1924 on a scheduled passenger train en route to British Columbia. The government had initially stated that the crime was perpetrated by people within the Doukhobor community, although the Doukhobors' customary refusal to cooperate with Canadian authorities due to fear of intersect violence culminated in no arrests being made. To date, it is still unknown who was responsible for the bombing. Thus, while the Doukhobors were initially welcomed by the Canadian government, this assassination, as well as Doukhobors' beliefs regarding communal living and no tolerance for schooling, and other beliefs considered offensive or unacceptable, created an air <b>of</b> <b>mistrust</b> between government authorities and Doukhobors which would last for decades.|$|E

The individual is likely to have a greater fear of walking alone at night. Griffin notes that people who view heavy amount of television think [...] "that five percent of society is involved in law enforcement", which is four percentage points higher than actuality. Finally, heavy television watchers are more <b>mistrusting</b> <b>of</b> people than light or medium television viewers. This suspicious view on the world is called the mean world syndrome.

25|$|At present Northern Ireland {{still faces}} {{policing}} issues, though {{not to the}} extent of the Troubles. There are concerns about harassment by police of children aged 14‚Äì18 in low socio-economic areas of Northern Ireland which has led to a deep level <b>of</b> <b>mistrust</b> between the youth and the police. Further, Catholics in Northern Ireland find that they are treated differently by police due to the police force being largely Protestant. 48% of Catholics that were surveyed in Northern Ireland reported harassment by the police. Instances of harassment include police officials spitting on individuals or enforcing laws in a discriminatory fashion, for example only to those who are Catholic. The Northern Ireland Police force has moved away from police brutality given the focus on accountability for the past and the significant decrease {{in the use of the}} baton amongst police members (guns are rarely used) however harassment continues to be a key issue for Northern Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Now in {{parliament}} the elected members grouped into a formal parliamentary party - the Austrian Green Party. Meissner-Blau was elected {{the first federal}} spokesperson {{and leader of the}} party at the inaugural party conference in Klagenfurt on February 12, 1987. The party initially proved to be structurally complex and continued to suffer from factional infighting. Activism by Greens in the late 1980s hampered the image of the parliamentary party, and there emerged a degree <b>of</b> <b>mistrust</b> between the suit-and-tie parliamentary wing and the more activist grass-roots party base. Meissner-Blau however served as a popular and moderating leader of the party. She served on a number of parliamentary committees and through speeches and legislative activism she assisted in establishing a unified parliamentary voice and cultivating a professional image for the group. After two years as leader and securing effective consolidation of the movement, she retired from the party, leaving her parliamentary seat on December 6, 1988.|$|E
25|$|The Red Flag riots {{occurred}} {{as a result}} of a number of changes within Australian society at the time. By 1918 there had been a growing anti-war and trade union movement. Additionally, {{as a result of}} the 1917 Russian revolution and the subsequent Brest‚ÄìLitovsk Treaty in March 1918, there was a climate <b>of</b> <b>mistrust</b> and fear within maintstream Australia towards the Russian community and a concern that certain elements might attempt to institute a similar type of revolution in Australia. These fears were compounded by increased industrial action and an almost xenophobic fear of non Anglo-Australians, which was in part due to the tensions caused by the war, but also partly due to the prevailing national psyche at the time. As a result of these fears, and concerns within the government about the effect of the trade union movement upon wartime production, the War Precautions Act had increasingly been used to settle labour disputes and although in some cases it could be seen that this was necessary to maintain wartime production, there were others that saw it as an attempt to suppress the trade unions.|$|E

The data suggest that, while some employees perceive trust and mistrust as two ends of a continuum, others see them as distinct concepts.

The paper concludes with a discussion regarding the co-existence <b>of</b> trust and <b>mistrust</b> and the explanatory value of organisational justice theory in understanding this...|$|R
25|$|Despite historical, {{cultural}} and ethnic links between them, relations between India and Pakistan have {{been plagued by}} years <b>of</b> <b>mistrust</b> and suspicion ever since the partition of India in 1947. The principal source of contention between India and its western neighbour has been the Kashmir conflict. After an invasion by Pashtun tribesmen and Pakistani paramilitary forces, the Hindu Maharaja of the Dogra Kingdom of Jammu and Kashmir, Hari Singh, and its Muslim Prime Minister, Sheikh Abdullah, signed an Instrument of Accession with New Delhi. The First Kashmir War started after the Indian Army entered Srinagar, {{the capital of the}} state, to secure the area from the invading forces. The war ended in December 1948 with the Line of Control dividing the erstwhile princely state into territories administered by Pakistan (northern and western areas) and India (southern, central and northeastern areas). Pakistan contested the legality of the Instrument of Accession since the Dogra Kingdom has signed a standstill agreement with it. The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 started following the failure of Pakistan's Operation Gibraltar, which was designed to infiltrate forces into Jammu and Kashmir to precipitate an insurgency against rule by India. The five-week war caused thousands of casualties on both sides. It ended in a United Nations (UN) mandated ceasefire and the subsequent issuance of the Tashkent Declaration.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to explore the relationship between attitudes toward help seeking, the ethnicity of the psychological help provider, and the level <b>of</b> cultural <b>mistrust</b> toward Jews. A sample of 102 Israeli Arab undergraduate students from Haifa, Israel, participated in this study. It was hypothesized that attitudes toward help seeking, as measured by Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help-Short Form (ATSPPH-S) and the Beliefs About Psychological Services (BAPS), will be related to the ethnicity of the psychological help provider and to the level <b>of</b> cultural <b>mistrust</b> toward Jews. A 2 x 2 between subjects multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was employed. No significant relationship was found between attitudes toward help seeking, the ethnicity of the psychological help provider, and the level <b>of</b> cultural <b>mistrust</b> toward Jews. However, ANOVAs revealed that Freshmen had more favorable attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help as measured by ATSPPH-S than fourth and fifth year students and that sophomores had more favorable attitudes toward seeking psychological help as measured by BAPS than fourth and fifth year students. The results of the logistic regression indicated that Muslim and Christian participants are {{three times more likely to}} choose an Arab help provider than Druze participants. Further, the probability of choosing an Arab psychological help provider increased significantly as the participant‚Äôs level <b>of</b> cultural <b>mistrust,</b> in the domains of Politics and Law and Interpersonal Relations increased. On the other hand, the probability of choosing an Arab psychological help provider decreased significantly when participants had previous psychological help, and when their level <b>of</b> cultural <b>mistrust</b> increased in the domain of Business and Work. Results indicated strong significant correlations between attitudes toward help seeking and variables such as father‚Äôs highest level of education, previous psychological help, age, and year in school. Significant correlations between beliefs about psychological help and year in school and gender were found.
