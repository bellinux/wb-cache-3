40|$|Ever tighter {{limits on}} {{pollutant}} emissions {{and the need}} to improve energy conversion efficiency have made the application of gasoline direct injection (GDI) feasible for a much wider scale of spark ignition engines. Changing the way fuel is delivered to the engine has thus provided increased flexibility but also challenges, such as higher particulate emissions. Therefore, alternative injection control strategies need to be investigated in order to obtain optimum performance and reduced environmental impact. In this study, experiments were carried out on a single-cylinder GDI optical engine fuelled with commercial gasoline in lean-burn conditions. The single-cylinder was equipped with the head of a commercial turbocharged engine with similar geometrical specifications (bore, stroke, compression ratio) and wall guided fuel injection. Optical accessibility was ensured through a conventional elongated hollow Bowditch piston and an <b>optical</b> <b>crown,</b> accommodating a fused-silica window. Experimental tests were performed at fixed engine speed and injection pressure, whereas the injection timing and the number of injections were adjusted to investigate their influence on combustion and emissions. UV-visible digital imaging was applied in order to follow the combustion process, from ignition to the late combustion phase. All the optical data were correlated with thermodynamic analysis and measurements of exhaust emissions. Split injection strategies (i. e. two injections per cycle) with respect to single injection increased combustion efficiency and stability thanks to an improvement of fuel air mixing. As a consequence, significant reduction in soot formation and exhaust emission with acceptable penalty in terms of HC and NOx were measured...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen {{has been}} largely {{proposed}} as a possible alternative fuel for internal combustion engines. Its wide flammability range allows higher engine efficiency with leaner operation than conventional fuels, for both reduced toxic emissions and no CO 2 gases. Independently, Homogenous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) also allows higher thermal efficiency and lower fuel consumption with reduced NOX emissions when compared to Spark-Ignition (SI) engine operation. For HCCI combustion, a mixture of air and fuel is supplied to the cylinder and autoignition occurs from compression; engine is operated throttle-less and load {{is controlled by the}} quality of the mixture, avoiding the large fluid-dynamic losses in the intake manifold of SI engines. HCCI can be induced and controlled by varying the mixture temperature, either by Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) or intake air pre-heating. A combination of HCCI combustion with hydrogen fuelling has great potential for virtually zero CO 2 and NOX emissions. Nevertheless, combustion on such a fast burning fuel with wide flammability limits and high octane number implies many disadvantages, such as control of backfiring and speed of autoignition and there is almost no literature on the subject, particularly in optical engines. Experiments were conducted in a single-cylinder research engine equipped with both Port Fuel Injection (PFI) and Direct Injection (DI) systems running at 1000 RPM. Optical access to in-cylinder phenomena was enabled through an extended piston and <b>optical</b> <b>crown.</b> Combustion images were acquired by a high-speed camera at 1 °or 2 °crank angle resolution for a series of engine cycles. Spark-ignition tests were initially carried out to benchmark the operation of the engine with hydrogen against gasoline. DI of hydrogen after intake valve closure was found to be preferable in order to overcome problems related to backfiring and air displacement from hydrogens low density. HCCI combustion of hydrogen was initially enabled by means of a pilot port injection of n-heptane preceding the main direct injection of hydrogen, along with intake air preheating. Sole hydrogen fuelling HCCI was finally achieved and made sustainable, even at the low compression ratio of the optical engine by means of closed-valve DI, in synergy with air-pre-heating and negative valve overlap to promote internal EGR. Various operating conditions were analysed, such as fuelling in the range of air excess ratio 1. 2 - 3. 0 and intake air temperatures of 200 - 400 °C. Finally, both single and double injections per cycle were compared to identify their effects on combustion development. Copyright © 2009 SAE International...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we report {{the use of}} {{adaptive}} optics to correct for sample induced aberrations in optical microscopy, crucially comparing individual pixel-by-pixel correction against a single correction for an entire optical section. Sample induced optical aberrations in slices of rat brain tissue were corrected with a deformable membrane mirror. Using axial resolution measurements, we demonstrate that a single aberration correction per optical slice achieves around 80 % of the maximum possible improvement compared to individual pixel-by-pixel correction in both confocal and multiphoton microscopy. A single aberration correction per depth, compared to pixel-by-pixel aberration correction, significantly decreases scan times and therefore reduces photobleaching and phototoxic effects enabling more rapid microscopy with active aberration correction.

25|$|The {{most common}} type of <b>optical</b> glass is <b>crown</b> glass, which has an index of {{refraction}} of about 1.52. An optimal single-layer coating would have to be made of a material with an index of about 1.23. Unfortunately, there are no solid materials with such a low refractive index. The closest materials with good physical properties for a coating are magnesium fluoride, MgF2 (with an index of 1.38), and fluoropolymers (which can have indices as low as 1.30, but are more difficult to apply). MgF2 on a crown glass surface gives a reflectance of about 1%, compared to 4% for bare glass. MgF2 coatings perform much better on higher-index glasses, especially those with index of refraction close to 1.9. MgF2 coatings are commonly used because they are cheap, and when they are designed for a wavelength {{in the middle of the}} visible band, they give reasonably good anti-reflection over the entire band. Researchers have produced films of mesoporous silica nanoparticles with refractive indices as low as 1.12, which function as antireflection coatings.|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is now emerging as {{a powerful tool for}} the investigation of unsteady fluid mechanics. At the same time, the study and optimisation of in-cylinder flow processes in automotive Internal Combustion (IC) engines is of increasing importance in the design of improved combustion systems with lower emissions and favourable power and efficiency characteristics. This thesis describes the development and application of PIV as a routine diagnostic tool for the investigation of in-cylinder flows in a production geometry single cylinder research engine exhibiting "barrel swirl" or "tumbling" in-cylinder fluid motion. The work has involved the design and installation of a complete PIV engine facility, based around a four-valve, four-stroke Rover research engine equipped with piston <b>crown</b> <b>optical</b> access and a glass cylinder liner. Novel techniques for the on-line monitoring of important experimental parameters have been developed which permit the reliable acquisition of high spatial resolution PIV data from both horizontal and vertical measurement planes within the engine cylinder. A novel optical correction technique has been developed to control the severe particle image degradation which was experienced when imaging vertical planes within the glass cylinder. A simple means for selection of an appropriate corrective lens for this application is described, together with an experimental evaluation of the lens performance. A representative set of PIV images and data from both horizontal and vertical planes are then presented. These have been selected from a comprehensive set of flow mapping experiments in the motored engine. The data are discussed with reference to the work of others in engines of similar geometry and have shed new light on the detailed processes involved in the formation and breakdown of barrel swirl. Initial PIV measurements ahead of a flame under part load, skip fired conditions have also been made in the engine. This has demonstrated the possibility of investigating incylinder flow behaviour under conditions approaching those in a fully firing, production geometry optical engine. Finally, limitations in the PIV technique employed in this work and methods of overcoming them are described and the prospects for further work are discussed...|$|R
