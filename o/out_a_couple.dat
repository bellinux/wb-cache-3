Flower hit 127 not out off 93 balls, as Upul Chandana {{especially}} got to be punished, conceding 64 runs from 9 overs. In reply, Alex Tudor snared <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of early wickets, Gloucestershire lost wickets at regular intervals, and even a quick hit-out from Chandana - who scored 32 off 30 balls - {{was not enough to}} take a win from the Eagles, their fifth of the season. Essex thus went top of the National League table along with Middlesex.|$|E
25|$|BBC Two {{also has}} {{regional}} {{variations in the}} nations: Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. These versions of BBC Two share the same idents, but with the nation name in the BBC Two box. BBC Two Scotland shows a lot of specifically Scottish programming on the channel, {{as well as its}} sister channel BBC One Scotland, and the schedules are often mixed around to match. BBC Two Northern Ireland and BBC Two Wales both have the option to opt out of the main network schedule, but generally stick to it, only opting <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of times each week. Until December 2008, BBC Wales broadcast a special, digital-only channel, BBC 2W, which contained more opt-outs than analogue-only BBC Two Wales. BBC Scotland occasionally broadcast Gaelic-language programmes under the banner BBC Two Alba.|$|E

25|$|Somerset Sabres {{completed}} their run by springing the final upset to beat Lancashire Lightning in the Twenty20 Cup final. It should perhaps have been renamed Sixteen16, because rain {{earlier in the}} day delayed the schedule and meant that the final had been shortened to 16 overs a side, while the semi-finals had both been 20 overs. However, Somerset didn't mind - their strongest batsmen were their numbers one and two, Graeme Smith and Marcus Trescothick, and the more relative impact these two would have, the better for the Sabres. Their task was made easier, though, as Somerset fast bowler Andrew Caddick dug <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of early Lancashire wickets, which was followed a run-out and two wickets in two balls from Richard Johnson, as Lancashire crawled to 41 for 5.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, Millikan {{referred}} I. H. Lyons {{from the}} National Postal Meter Company to Arnold Beckman. Lyons wanted a non-clogging ink so that postage could be printed by machines, {{instead of having}} clerks lick stamps. Beckman's solution was to make ink with butyric acid, a malodorous substance. Because of this ingredient, no manufacturer wanted to manufacture it. Beckman decided to make it himself. He started the National Inking Appliance Company, obtaining space in a garage owned by instrument maker Fred Henson and hiring two Caltech students, Robert Barton and Henry Fracker. Beckman developed and took <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of patents for re-inking typewriter ribbons, but marketing them was not successful. This was Beckman's first experience at running a company and marketing a product, and while this first product failed, Beckman repurposed the company for another product.|$|E
25|$|Andy Flower {{took the}} Gloucestershire Gladiators' bowlers for 127 runs in 93 balls at The County Ground in Chelmsford {{as he and}} Ronnie Irani paired up for 139 to send Essex Eagles to a final score of 271 for 7. Upul Chandana got the most {{expensive}} figures, with 64 runs off nine overs, but James Averis also conceded six an over – and unlike Chandana, {{he did not take}} a wicket. In reply, Alex Tudor snared <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of wickets in the first 20 minutes, and Gloucestershire lost nine men for 182 after three wickets from Pakistani spinner Danish Kaneria. Even a hit-out from Chandana – who scored 32 off 30 balls, his highest score in six innings in 2005 – was not enough to take a win from the Eagles, their fifth of the season. Essex thus went top of the National League table along with Middlesex.|$|E

500|$|Announcing {{a change}} of name in January 1988, Bill Drummond had said [...] "We might put <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of 12" [...] records under the name The K.L.F., these will be rap free just pure dance music, so don't expect to see them {{reviewed}} in the music papers". As predicted, [...] "Burn the Beat" [...] and [...] "Burn the Bastards" [...] attracted little attention from the music press.|$|E
500|$|Sander {{considered}} [...] "ShutDOWN" [...] as [...] "the absolute {{highlight of}} the album", comparing it to the Porcupine Tree track [...] "Russia on Ice". Bollenberg listed his favorite track as [...] "Hello, Helicopter!": [...] "it once again gets so very close to authentic Porcupine Tree with Portnoy introducing some tribal rhythms that go ever so well {{with the rest of}} the material. I simply melt once that superb sound of the Fender Rhodes enters, taking turns with synthesizer tweaks." [...] Gordon described the instrumental parts of the album as [...] "powerful and purposeful: an integral part of each composition rather than an excuse to merely 'jam.'" [...] Sander praised the tracks [...] "The New Math" [...] and [...] "Dirt from a Holy Place", but criticized the more experimental [...] "Horseshoes and B-52s": [...] "to me it sometimes sounds like some random cutting and pasting was done on this track, leaving <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of seconds here and there." [...] He criticized the track's video as [...] "nearly unbearable to watch. If some video games are bad for people with epilepsy, this video is going to instantly kill them." ...|$|E
500|$|This simple tactic proved unstoppable. Soon, he had {{surpassed the}} 50-point barrier, causing arena speaker Dave Zinkoff {{to fire up}} the {{previously}} sleepy crowd. Chamberlain also kept his cool despite getting perpetually triple and quadruple-teamed by the Knicks, who did not shy away from hard fouls to distract the center. McGuire was irate and demanded that the referees call more fouls, but Chamberlain could not be stopped. He scored another 28 points to lift his Warriors to a commanding 125–106 lead {{by the end of}} the third quarter. His own total stood at 69, nine shy of his previous scoring record. The Knicks' third center, Dave Budd, who alternated with the foul-troubled Imhoff at pivot, later stated that resistance was futile: [...] "You couldn't play [...] conventionally because he was so big. The only thing you could attempt to do was either front him, and in that case they'd try to lob it in to him, or beat him down the floor and set up where he wanted to get and force him <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of extra steps. The guy weighed 300 or 270 , so that wasn't easy, either." [...] Chamberlain now realized he could break his own 73-point scoring record (for a regulation 48-minute game) or his record 78 points, set in triple overtime.|$|E

500|$|The cast found <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> {{of weeks}} before filming the episode that parts would be in animation. The {{animated}} portions were produced with Zoic Studios. Over an eight-week period, the studio defined the primary Fringe characters into their animated counterparts, and used footage of the actors and fight scene choreography to provide motion for the characters. The animators used a stand-in for Nimoy so {{that he did not}} have to fly to Vancouver from Los Angeles. The studio aimed to achieve a mixed look between stylized and authenticity to allow them to focus on animating the characters' emotions. The work also include recreating some of the settings already established from Fringe, such as Bell's office. Other parts of Olivia's dreamscape were handpainted scenes, projected onto 3D plates and used within the animation software. Andrew Orloff, Zoic's creative director commented, [...] "This project was one of the most intensive and rewarding we have worked on in Zoic’s history. It was an incredible undertaking, from the amazing writers at Fringe to the animation production that is both steeped in tradition and groundbreaking." [...] The episode ultimately contained sixteen minutes of animation; executive producer Jeff Pinkner noted that the amount of man hours placed into the episode was [...] "by far" [...] the longest the series has had to date. The writers have cited Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Waltz with Bashir as influences for the episode.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic's {{music video}} for [...] "Smells Like Nirvana", the second verse is subtitled {{as a way}} to mock the {{supposed}} unintelligibility of the song. One of the lines is [...] "It's hard to bargle nawdle zouss???" [...] (with three question marks), which has no meaning, but is explained by the following line, [...] "With all these marbles in my mouth". While singing the latter, Yankovic indeed spits <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of marbles.|$|E
2500|$|Dennis {{was one of}} two {{cast members}} who knew the {{identity}} of the culprit; he was told minutes before he filmed the scene in which Paul was pushed. The rest of the cast found <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of weeks after the 6000th episode was broadcast. The person responsible for the attempted murder was revealed to be Rebecca Robinson (Jane Hall) during the episode broadcast on 27 September 2010. Hall revealed that she had known her character was responsible from the beginning. The [...] "Who Pushed P.R.?" [...] storyline was well received by critics and viewers. Despite low ratings for the 6000th episode in Australia, the storyline provided the show with a small ratings increase in the UK.|$|E

2500|$|Several episodes have {{deviated}} from this formula: a fourth-season episode explored {{the issue of}} mold in the household, and Holmes {{was brought in to}} investigate the matter after the homeowner had done some investigative work on their own; a fifth-season episode saw Holmes and crew build a common fence for 52 households, while a sixth-season episode saw Holmes and crew clean up and restore a house that had been rented out and, unknown to the homeowner, turned into a marijuana grow-op. [...] The sixth-season Pasadena 911 two-hour episode also saw Mike and senior contractor Damon Bennett travel to Los Angeles to help <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> in need after Holmes' own appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.|$|E
2500|$|In 1915, writer Santos Cifuentes {{wrote an}} article titled [...] "Hacia el americanismo musical - La musica en Colombia" [...] (Towards a musical Americanism - Music in Colombia) In it, he {{mentions}} the Colombian tiple. Unfamiliar with the instrument Cifuentes points <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of flaws, but his writing is of historic value since it explains that the tiple has by this time 12 strings. [...] (The ten string tiple still survives as the [...] "American Tiple", often {{also known as the}} [...] "Martin Tiple", after the chief manufacturer of this type in the states, the Martin Guitar Company. [...] Besides having fewer strings the American Tiple differs in being smaller than the tiple Colombiano, nearer the size of a baritone ukulele, than a guitar.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{name change}} {{accompanied}} {{a change in}} Drummond and Cauty's musical direction.

King Boy D also claimed that he and Rockman Rock were [...] "pissed off at selves" [...] for letting [...] "people expect us to lead some sort of crusade for sampling". In 1990 he recalled that [...] "We wanted to make [...] something that was ... pure dance music, without any reference points, without any nod {{to the history of}} rock and roll. It was the type of music that by early '87 was really exciting me... we weren't able to get our first KLF records out until late '88".|$|E

2500|$|In 1802, Putnam {{purchased}} {{an acre of}} {{land from}} Henry Walton beside Congress Spring and hired carpenters to build the first hotel of Saratoga Springs. Completed and opened in 1803, the three-story guesthouse was named [...] "Putnam's Tavern and Boarding House", though designated [...] "Putnam's Folly" [...] by locals for its [...] "pretentiousness" [...] and his [...] "optimism and ambition". The guesthouse was rather conspicuous, for the entire area was blanketed in wilderness. At the time, the village comprised [...] "a few log cabins, and the visitors were all invalids". New settlers in the area {{had the opportunity to}} buy plots of Putnam's property, and they instantly sold <b>out.</b> <b>A</b> <b>couple</b> years later, Putnam expanded the hotel, including a parlor, dining room, and ballroom. The guesthouse's name was later changed to [...] "Union Hall". It was owned by Putnam's progeny until 1864, when it was sold to the Leland Brothers, who renamed it [...] "Grand Union" [...] in 1869.|$|E
2500|$|The Grateful Dead formed {{during the}} era when bands {{such as the}} Beatles, the Beach Boys and the Rolling Stones were {{dominating}} the airwaves. [...] "The Beatles were why we turned from a jug band into a rock 'n' roll band," [...] said Bob Weir. [...] "What we saw them doing was impossibly attractive. I couldn't {{think of anything else}} more worth doing." [...] Former folk-scene star Bob Dylan had recently put <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of records featuring electric instrumentation. Grateful Dead members have said that it was after attending a concert by the touring New York City band the Lovin' Spoonful that they decided to [...] "go electric" [...] and look for a dirtier sound. Gradually, many of the East-Coast American folk musicians, formerly luminaries of the coffee-house scene, were moving in the electric direction. It was natural for Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir, each of whom had been immersed in the American folk music revival of the late 1950s and early 1960s, to be open-minded toward electric guitars.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the word [...] "gothic" [...] {{was used to}} {{describe}} the atmosphere of post-punk bands like Siouxsie and the Banshees, Magazine and Joy Division. In a live review about a Siouxsie and the Banshees' concert in July 1978, critic Nick Kent wrote that concerning their performance, [...] "parallels and comparisons can now be drawn with gothic rock architects like the Doors and, certainly, early Velvet Underground". In March 1979, Kent used the gothic adjective in his review of Magazine's second album, Secondhand Daylight. Kent noted that there was [...] "a new austere sense of authority" [...] to their music, with a [...] "dank neo-Gothic sound". Later that year, Martin Hannett described Joy Division as [...] "dancing music with gothic overtones" [...] and in September, their manager Tony Wilson described their music as [...] "gothic" [...] on the television show Something Else. In 1980, Melody Maker wrote that [...] "Joy Division are masters of this gothic gloom". When their final album Closer came <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of months after the death of their singer, Sounds noted in its review that there were [...] "dark strokes of gothic rock".|$|E
