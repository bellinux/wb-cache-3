He fought back with the help <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and recovered his strength, confidence, and pride before {{he died of a}} heart attack five years later. In the end, I think he found comfort in knowing that what he did saved some airmen's lives, and that was worth more to him than four stars.|$|E

Months before this, Madonna noticed changes in her mother's {{behavior}} and personality from the attentive homemaker she was, but did not understand the reasons. Mrs. Ciccone, at a loss to explain her dire medical condition, would often begin to cry when questioned by Madonna, at which point Madonna would respond by wrapping her arms around her mother tenderly. [...] "I remember feeling stronger than she was", Madonna recalled, [...] "I was so little and yet I felt like she was the child." [...] Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying. [...] "There was so much left unsaid, so many untangled and unresolved emotions, of remorse, guilt, loss, anger, confusion....
