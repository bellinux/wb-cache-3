Critics said the brothers were greedy and unfair and compared their actions unfavorably to European inventors, who worked more openly. Supporters said the brothers were protecting their interests and were justified in expecting fair compensation for the years of work leading to their successful invention. Their 10-year friendship with Octave Chanute, already strained by tension <b>over</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> credit, if any, he might deserve for their success, collapsed after he publicly criticized their actions.|$|E

5|$|For {{eight years}} after the fire, One Meridian Plaza sat vacant and damaged—in the center of Philadelphia's {{business}} district. The building was caught in litigation between the owners and the insurance company <b>over</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> the insurers would pay the owners and how repairs or demolition would proceed. Businesses near the empty high-rise closed or moved and the city sued the owners {{to do something with}} the building. After lawsuits were settled, the building was declared a total loss and began to be dismantled in 1998. At the time of its demolition in 1999, One Meridian Plaza was the third-tallest destroyed building in the world.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the storm, more than 1,000 Electricity Supply Board (ESB) {{personnel}} were deployed to restore power. In some areas, locals worked together to provide others with fresh food after electricity was lost. Fire brigades were sent on patrol to quell any looting. In Galway, ESB repair crews worked through labor and supply shortages to restore power and telephone service despite recent strikes in the company. By September 23, officials in the city appealed to the Government for funding to deal with the aftermath of the hurricane. Uncertainty over whether some of the cost could be footed by landowners themselves resulted in disagreement <b>over</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> aid to request. Due to the severity of damage to the electrical grid, there were numerous requests made to the ESB to build underground power cables, especially in Galway.|$|E

50|$|In {{the great}} {{compilations}} of ecclesiastical law that {{arose in the}} East since the 3rd century, the Church Orders many canons were attributed to Hippolytus, for example in the Canons of Hippolytus or the Constitutions through Hippolytus. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> of this material is genuinely his, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of it worked <b>over,</b> and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of it wrongly attributed to him, {{can no longer be}} determined beyond dispute, however a great deal was incorporated into the Fetha Negest, which once served as the constitutional basis of law in Ethiopia — where he is still remembered as Abulides. During the early 20th century the work known as The Egyptian Church Order was identified as the Apostolic Tradition and attributed to Hippolytus; nowaday this attribution is hotly contested.|$|R

25|$|There is some dispute <b>over</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> direct {{operational}} control Haig maintained at this time, Tim Travers in particular arguing that he allowed his Army Commanders (Plumer, Byng, Horne, Birdwood and Rawlinson) a very free hand, whilst {{at the same}} time Ferdinand Foch, whose role had initially been confined to advice and deployment of reserves, was exerting ever-greater influence over strategy. Haig was irritated that Foch insisted that Plumer's Second Army remain part of an Army Group commanded by the King of the Belgians, so that the French and Belgians could take credit for liberating Brussels.|$|E

However, the manuscripts appended to the second edition suggest that Jane Austen was intensely interested in revising her manuscripts and was perhaps less content than Austen-Leigh described her.

Notwithstanding the roominess of her castle, she was at present living somewhat incommodiously, owing partly to the stagnation caused by her recent bereavement, and partly to the necessity for overhauling the De Stancy lumber piled in those vast and gloomy chambers before they could be made tolerable to nineteenth-century fastidiousness.|$|R

25|$|Following the Six-Day War, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 242 which {{proposed}} {{a peaceful solution}} to the Arab-Israeli conflict. The resolution was accepted by Israel, Jordan, and Egypt, but rejected by Syria until 1972–73 and the Yom Kippur War. To this day, Resolution 242 remains controversial due to conflicting interpretations <b>over</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> territory Israel {{would be required to}} withdraw from in order to conform with the resolution. Also, after the Israeli occupation of the West Bank following the war, Palestinian nationalism substantially increased. Armed resistance was encouraged from within the newly occupied territories and from the Arab nations that lost in the war.|$|E
25|$|Parallel {{to events}} in Germany, a {{movement}} began in Switzerland {{under the leadership}} of Huldrych Zwingli. Zwingli was a scholar and preacher, who in 1518 moved to Zurich. Although the two movements agreed on many issues of theology, some unresolved differences kept them separate. A long-standing resentment between the German states and the Swiss Confederation led to heated debate <b>over</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> Zwingli owed his ideas to Lutheranism. The German Prince Philip of Hesse saw potential in creating an alliance between Zwingli and Luther. A meeting was held in his castle in 1529, now known as the Colloquy of Marburg, which has become infamous for its failure. The two men could not come to any agreement due to their disputation over one key doctrine.|$|E

By varying these hardware parameters, we obtain a hierarchy of time bounds for worst-case permutation routing...|$|R
25|$|For {{a dog to}} be {{considered}} for a Police Department, they must first pass a basic obedience training course. They must be able to obey the commands of their handler without hesitation. This allows the officer to have complete control <b>over</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> force the dog should use against a suspect. Dogs trained in Europe are usually given commands in the country's native language. Dogs are initially trained with this language for basic behavior, so, it is easier for the officer to learn new words/commands, rather than retraining the dog to new commands. This is contrary to the popular belief that Police Dogs are trained in a different language so that a suspect cannot command the dog against the officer.|$|E
25|$|During the Quaternary Period, {{the total}} volume of land ice, sea level, and global {{temperature}} has fluctuated initially on 41,000- and more recently on 100,000-year time scales, as evidenced most clearly by ice cores for the past 800,000 years and marine sediment cores for the earlier period. Over the past 740,000 years there have been eight glacial cycles. The entire Quaternary Period, starting 2.58 Ma, {{is referred to as}} an ice age because at least one permanent large ice sheet—the Antarctic ice sheet—has existed continuously. There is uncertainty <b>over</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of Greenland was covered by ice during the previous and earlier interglacials. During the colder episodes—referred to as glacial periods—large ice sheets at least 4km thick at their maximum also existed in Europe, North America, and Siberia.

25|$|The debate <b>over</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of Genji was {{actually}} written by Murasaki Shikibu {{has gone on}} for centuries and is unlikely to ever be settled unless some major archival discovery is made. It is generally accepted that the tale was finished in its present form by 1021, when the author of the Sarashina Nikki wrote a diary entry about her joy at acquiring a complete copy of the tale. She writes that there are over 50 chapters and mentions a character introduced {{at the end of the}} work, so if other authors besides Murasaki Shikibu did work on the tale, the work was done very near to the time of her writing. Murasaki Shikibu's own diary includes a reference to the tale, and indeed the application to herself of the name 'Murasaki' in an allusion to the main female character. That entry confirms that some if not all of the diary was available in 1008 when internal evidence suggests convincingly that the entry was written.|$|E
50|$|From {{work that}} has been done along the flawed axis {{described}} above, it is said that was until recently generally assumed that children's difficulties with divorce, while common, were short-lived. However, recent authors have argued that a major cost to children comes long after: when they attempt to form stable marriages themselves. There is extensive and heated debate <b>over</b> just <b>how</b> <b>much</b> harm, just <b>how</b> many children are harmed to what extent, what factors mediate the harm, and so on. Professor Mavis Hetherington of the University of Virginia reports that 70% of children coming from divorced families consider divorce an adequate answer to marital problems (even if children are present), compared to only 40% of children from non-divorced families.|$|R

25|$|However, debate <b>over</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> {{the program}} helped to develop {{affordable}} {{housing in the}} city continued. Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, along with other advocacy groups, worried {{that the loss of}} the tax break would make affordable housing too expensive to build in the city, and that the city would have to pay more to build such units. From when Mayor de Blasio took office in January 2014 to the expiration of the program in January 2016, developers received financing for 13,929 affordable units, of which 5,006 utilized the 421-a abatement program. In response to this issue, Governor Cuomo brought both union leaders and real estate executives together to create a deal on paying union-level wages on 421-a projects. At the conclusion of negotiations, unions and real estate developers reached an agreement to pay workers $60/hr on covered projects in Manhattan and $45/hr on covered projects within a mile of the East River waterfront in Queens and Brooklyn. As such, the bill was submitted to the state legislature for approval. The program was officially revived with the passage of New York State's $153.1 billion budget in April 2017.|$|E
25|$|There is some dispute <b>over</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> direct {{operational}} control Haig maintained in the Hundred Days, Tim Travers arguing that he exercised “a symbolic form of leadership”, allowing his Army Commanders (Plumer, Byng, Horne, Birdwood and Rawlinson) a very free hand, whilst {{at the same}} time Ferdinand Foch, whose role had initially been confined to advice and deployment of reserves, was exerting ever-greater influence over strategy. Robin Prior argues that by the second half of 1918 both Lloyd George and Haig were “moving steadily to the sidelines”, although he also concedes that Haig intervened in operations much less now he knew the BEF to be a fine fighting instrument and “he proved far more effective as a commander” as a result. By contrast Sheffield argues that Haig was Foch’s principal subordinate—they met sixty times between April and November—and influenced his strategy (in Wiest's view Foch was also “a buffer between Haig and his political tormentors in London”.) “At last (Haig) was able to behave as the sort of “arms-length” Commander-in-Chief that was his ideal: setting broad objectives” but devolving detailed planning of battles. Besides, “he had presided over the transformation of the army” and “Haig’s performance as a general improved as the army matured. He was … doing fewer things better”. GHQ also {{played a key role in}} sequencing the attacks of the armies in late September, and keeping them fully supplied.|$|E

(6e-7a) Socrates applauds this definition, because it is expressed in a general form, but criticizes it saying that the gods disagree among themselves {{as to what is}} [...] "pleasing". This means that a given action, disputed by the gods, would be both pious and impious at the same time - a logical impossibility. Euthyphro argues against Socrates' criticism, by noting that not even the gods would disagree, among themselves, that someone who kills without justification should be punished. Yet Socrates argues that disputes would still arise - <b>over</b> just <b>how</b> <b>much</b> justification actually existed; hence, the same action could be pious and impious; again, Euthyphro's definition cannot be a definition of [...] "piety".|$|R
