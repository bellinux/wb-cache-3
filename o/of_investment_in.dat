5|$|Solid waste {{management}} {{is one of}} key compelling issues facing Gazans today. These challenges are attributed to several factors; the lack <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> environmental systems, less attention was given to environmental projects, {{and the absence of}} law enforcement and the tendency towards crisis management. One of the main aspects of this problem is the huge quantities of rubble and debris generated as a result of Israeli bombardments.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} events in 2006 pushed {{renewable}} energy up the political agenda, including the US mid-term elections in November, which confirmed clean energy as a mainstream issue. Also in 2006, the Stern Review made a strong economic case for investing in low carbon technologies now, and argued that economic growth need not be incompatible with cutting energy consumption. According to a trend analysis from the United Nations Environment Programme, climate change concerns coupled with recent high oil prices and increasing government support are driving increasing rates <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries.|$|E

5|$|For decades Salford's {{economy was}} heavily {{dependent}} on manufacturing industry, especially textiles and engineering. Since the Second World War however, Salford has experienced decades of growing unemployment as these sectors diminished and new sectors chose to locate in out of town locations with better transport links. Between 1965 and 1991 the city lost over 49,000jobs, or more than 32% of its employment base. Several factors contributed to this decline, not least changes in the national and international economies, {{the introduction of new}} technology and the concentration <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> London and South East England. The biggest job losses were experienced in Salford's traditional industries and although the service sector expanded during this period, it was unable to compensate for the decline in manufacturing.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, the Norwegian state was {{severely}} weakened. In 1389 Norway {{entered into a}} personal union with Denmark and Sweden in the Kalmar Union. As the kings resided in Denmark, Norway was gradually reduced to a provincial status, and after the Reformation most of its separate institutions were abolished. The Danish government in Copenhagen regarded Norway as a backward province to be exploited, but not worthy <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> monumental architecture. Hence, ambitious Renaissance architecture is unusual in Norway compared to other European countries.|$|E
5|$|Morales' {{second term}} was heavily {{affected}} by infighting and dissent from {{within his own}} support base, as indigenous and leftist activists came to oppose {{a number of the}} governments' reforms. In May 2010, Morales' government announced a 5% rise in the minimum wage. The Bolivian Workers' Central (COB) felt this insufficient given the rise in the cost of living, and called a general strike. Protesters clashed with police, although the government refused to increase the rise, accusing protesters of being pawns of the right. In August 2010, violent protests then broke out in southern Potosí over widespread unemployment and a lack <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> infrastructure.|$|E
40|$|Development {{policies}} have {{been a problem for}} economists for a long time. Latin American Structuralists emphasized the role <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> economic infrastructure as a crucial policy to promote development, while the New Growth Literature has mainly emphasized the role <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> human capital. This paper relies on a model in the Endogenous Growth tradition to show that these two alternative policies are not distributionally neutral.

The emperor and his officials intervened at times of crisis to ensure the provisioning of the capital, and to keep down the price of cereals.

5|$|The {{holes in}} the cuticle which allow for this {{digestive}} mechanism pose a challenge for the plant, since they serve as breaks in the cuticle (waxy layer) that protects the plant from desiccation. As a result, P. moranensis is usually found in relatively humid environments. The production of the stalked capture glands and sessile digestive glands is also costly. A {{recent study found that}} the density of these respective glands can be correlated to environmental gradients. For example, capture gland density was found to be highest where prey availability was low, whereas digestive glands density showed direct correlation to prey availability. These results suggest that the amount <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> carnivorous features is an adaptation to the environmental gradients.|$|E

The results suggest the existence of the context- independent paths that are common to both groups; however, there is evidence that some of the impacts <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> telecoms are dependent on the level of economic development. The results of the investigation offer valuable insights to decision and policy makers tasked with the responsibility of improving the micro- and macroeconomic impacts <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> telecoms...|$|R

40|$|This study evaluates {{technical}} efficiency (TE) levels for rural households under {{high and low}} levels <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> soil conservation in El Salvador and Honduras. To correct for potential self-selectivity bias a household-level switching regression framework is implemented to estimate separate stochastic production frontiers {{for the two groups}} of households under analysis. The main results indicate that a systematic difference exists between the two studied groups. Specifically, households with higher levels <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> soil conservation show higher average TE than those with a lower level <b>of</b> <b>investments.</b> Constrains <b>in</b> the rural land and credit markets appear to be the reason behind these differences. Our estimations indicate that for farms with lower levels <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> soil conservation access to credit is a significant factor explaining the sources of inefficiency. Conversely, households with higher levels <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> soil conservation present the highest partial output elasticity for land, the highest levels of TE and the smallest farms.
