40|$|The aims of {{this project}} were {{completed}} successfully, and they included the continued monitoring of transplanted green ant colonies at Howard Springs, the production of instructive materials for cashew farmers, and {{the implementation of the}} green ant technology in a cashew plantations at LaBelle Downs Station. Field monitoring showed that the transplanted ant colonies, on average, persisted in the cashew orchards for three cashew cropping seasons. Compared with the costs associated with the insecticide spray area, using green ant colonies to manage the main insect pests allows cashew growers to achieve a savings of $ 235 /ha/year in maintenance costs. Apart from better quality of <b>cashew</b> <b>nuts,</b> <b>trees</b> protected by transplanted ant colonies also produced yields of 861 kg/ha/year more <b>cashew</b> <b>nuts</b> than <b>trees</b> protected by insecticides. The combined benefits of the green ant technology account to at least $ 1500 /ha/year compared to the use of insecticides. Colony age is an important factor responsible for the period of persistence of the colony in cashew orchards. Our results indicate that colonies between the ages of 1. 5 and 2 years are suitable to transplant, and the age is easily determined in the field. A booklet "Why and how to use green ants to control the main cashew insect pests - Manual for Australian cashew growers" has been written to facilitate the implementation of green ant technology. It covers all aspects of appropriately using green ants to control insect pests in cashew plantations. A series of posters has been made based on the contents of the booklet to highlight the most important procedures of the ant technology.

40|$|<b>Cashew</b> <b>nut</b> allergy can be {{a severe}} food allergy of which the {{prevalence}} appears to be increasing. The aim of this thesis was a comprehensive molecular and serological characterisation of the <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> allergens Ana o 1, 2 and 3 for improved diagnosis and characterisation of patient populations. Chapter 1 in this thesis provides background information on <b>cashew</b> <b>nuts,</b> allergy, the allergens Ana o 1, 2 and 3, the effect of heat treatments on <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> proteins, the digestibility of <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> proteins, cross-reactivity between <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> proteins and other <b>tree</b> <b>nuts,</b> and the detection of <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> in food products. Subsequently, in Chapter 2, a review is presented {{on the topic of}} epithelial protein and allergen transport. This review describes multiple pathways of intestinal protein transport, sums up existing experimental data concerning protein and peptide transport, and presents different methods to study this. Interestingly, the pathway of (allergenic) protein transport can differ between sensitized and non-sensitized persons. In sensitized persons, protein transport occurs transcellularly via enterocytes, and paracellularly with the involvement of mast cells, while in non-sensitized persons microfold cells and enterocytes are considered most important. In the next three chapters, <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> allergens were studied. <b>Cashew</b> <b>nut</b> allergy and <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> allergens were chosen because of a high number of undiagnosed <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> allergic children reported at the children’s hospital “Kinderhaven”, in Rotterdam, an outpatient clinic that is involved in this study. Chapter 3 describes a protocol for the purification of Ana o 1, 2 and 3 from <b>cashew</b> <b>nuts.</b> Ana o 1 and 3 were purified by protein extraction, salt precipitation and filtering over a 30 kDa molecular weight membrane. Ana o 2 was purified by protein extraction followed by gel filtration chromatography. These purified proteins were characterised by SDS-PAGE, western blot, glycoprotein stain, and protein identification. In this chapter also more in-depth analysis was performed on the N- and C-termini of the large and small subunits of Ana o 3. These N- and C-termini of Ana o 3, as well as the SDS-PAGE protein profiles were compared between <b>cashew</b> <b>nuts</b> of different origins in Chapter 4. In this chapter also the effects of different heat treatments on the electrophoretic behaviour of <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> allergens from various origins were studied, using both 1 D and 2 D electrophoresis. In these data no significant differences were detected between the electrophoresis patterns of Ana o 1, 2 or 3 in the various origins of <b>cashew</b> <b>nuts.</b> Some small but significant differences in Ana o 1, 2 and 3 content, however, were detected between the differently heated <b>cashew</b> <b>nuts.</b> No major differences in N- and C-terminal micro-heterogeneity were detected between <b>cashew</b> <b>nuts</b> of different origins. Next, in Chapter 5, the <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> allergens Ana o 1, 2 and 3 were produced as recombinant proteins using a yeast (P. pastoris) production system. This procedure was used as recombinant allergens often produce higher yields of higher purity compared to native purified allergens. The recombinant proteins were compared to the native <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> proteins for their glycosylation pattern, IgE binding capacity, and 2 D electrophoresis profile. In Chapter 6, the major findings of this thesis are discussed. An overview of the protein characteristics (e. g. 1 D and 2 D electrophoresis profile, glycosylation, IgE binding, pepsin-digestibility) was provided, as well as a discussion on the clinical benefits that can be derived from the results obtained in this thesis. Also some additional results are presented, studying the serologic cross-reactivity between <b>cashew</b> <b>nuts</b> and other <b>tree</b> <b>nuts</b> and Anacardiaceae nuts and fruits. This thesis provides an in-depth study regarding the protein characteristics of the <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> allergens Ana o 1, 2 and 3. Using the allergens that were purified in this thesis project, the serum IgE levels of Ana o 1, 2 and 3 could be measured in cashew nut-allergic children. The allergens were also recombinantly produced to obtain higher quantity of allergens for regular use in diagnostics of <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> allergy. The results from this thesis can potentially expand clinical patient characterisation with measurements of IgE levels to purified and recombinantly produced major <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> allergens. These results might have applications for other food allergens or patient populations...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Cashew</b> <b>nut,</b> {{pistachio}} nut and mango {{belong to the}} Anacardiaceae family and are botanically related. Therefore, <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> sensitised children are frequently advised to eliminate <b>cashew</b> <b>nuts</b> and {{pistachio nut}}s from their diet. The ‘Improvement of Diagnostic mEthods for ALlergy assessment (IDEAL trial number NTR 3572) study showed that <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> sensitised children were co-sensitised to pistachio nut in 98 % of cases and to mango in 21 % of cases. The aim of this follow-up study to IDEAL is to assess the clinical relevance of co-sensitisation to pistachio nut and mango in <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> sensitised children. Methods: Children were recruited from the study: ‘Improvement of Diagnostic mEthods for ALlergy assessment (IDEAL trial number NTR 3572). Inclusion criterion for the IDEAL study was sensitization to <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> as demonstrated by either SPT or sIgE, and a clinical history of reactions to <b>cashew</b> <b>nuts</b> or no previous (known) exposure.

This study also investigated the possibility of using pure biofuel in an unmodified naturally aspirated diesel engine. The outcome of this study showed that adding hexanol at 10 % and 20 % (by volume) to <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> shell biodiesel results in a reduction in emissions. In addition, a significant improvement in brake thermal efficiency and reduction in brake-specific fuel consumptions were achieved. Hence, it could be concluded that hexanol could be a viable and promising additive for improving the drawbacks of biodiesel when it was used to fuel an unmodified diesel engine.|$|R
40|$|Thorough {{knowledge}} of the physical properties of <b>cashew</b> <b>nuts</b> {{in its present form}} is necessary in the design of its shelling machine. A study was carried out {{to determine the effects of}} pre-treatment by hot oil roasting and steam boiling on the physical properties of <b>cashew</b> <b>nut.</b> Samples of <b>cashew</b> <b>nuts</b> obtained from five plantations in Iseyin area of Oyo State and Iwo in Osun State in the South-Western Nigeria were used in this work. About 3 kg of nuts were picked from 20 randomly selected trees in each of the plantations. The <b>cashew</b> <b>nuts</b> were subjected to pre-treatment by steam boiling and hot oil roasting. The physical properties of raw and pre-treated <b>cashew</b> <b>nuts</b> were determined using standard methods. The results showed that nuts from South-Western Nigeria, which were used for the experiment, could be classified as medium large and extra large ie 22 - 35 mm. The pre-shelling treatment showed significant difference (P< 0. 05) in the means of length and width of <b>cashew</b> <b>nut,</b> and no significant difference for thickness, aspect ratio and sphericity index. The treatment showed significant difference (P< 0. 05) in true and bulk densities but showed no difference in the porosities of the nuts. The moisture content of raw kernel was significantly different (P< 0. 05) from that of roasted and steam-boiled kernels. The physical properties of <b>cashew</b> <b>nuts</b> were found to be affected by pre-treatment by hot oil roasting and steam boiling...|$|R
40|$|The {{cashew tree}} (Anacardium occidentale) is a branchy {{evergreen}} tree native to tropical areas that {{grows in a}} wide range of soils and has a 25 year life span. <b>Cashew</b> <b>nuts</b> rank third in the the world production of edible nuts and represent a major source of alkenyl phenolic compounds. The fruit of the tree consists of an outer shell (epicarp), a tight fitting inner shell (endocarp), testa and the kernel. The pericarp of the fruit contains a strongly vesicant liquid that is mostly anacardic acids and cardols, which has to be removed before obtaining the valuable <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> kernel. In current <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> processing techniques, much of the phenolic liquid is wasted or damaged through heat treatment steps and many parts of the <b>nut</b> and <b>tree</b> are ineffectively utilized. As part of research philosophy, we are examining the application of supercritical fluids to improve the processing of renewable resources. In this work, we examing the reactive phase behavior of the <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> material and some of the phenolic liquid solubility characteristics. Reactive phase behavior is the characteristic phase behavior of a material in the presence of a solvent during reacting conditions. The reactive phase behavior of many polymers and biological materials in water will be especially important in developing new agricultural-based processes. Sasaki et al. [1], found that cellulose could be completely dissolved in water without acids, bases, or other catalysts as mixture...|$|R

40|$|Background: The double-blind, {{placebo-controlled}} food {{challenge test}} (DBPCFC) is {{the gold standard}} in <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> allergy. This test is costly, time consuming and not without side effects. Analysis of IgE reactivity to <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> components may {{reduce the need for}} food challenge tests. Methods: In a prospective and multicentre study, children with suspected <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> allergy underwent a DBPCFC with <b>cashew</b> <b>nut.</b> Specific IgE to <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> and to the components Ana o 1, 2 and 3 were determined. A skin prick test (SPT) with <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> extract was performed. The association between the outcome of the food challenge test and specific IgE to Ana o 1, 2 and 3 was assessed with logistic regression analyses, unadjusted and adjusted for other diagnostic variables. Discriminative ability was quantified with a concordance index (c). Results: A total of 173 children (103 boys, 60 %) with a median age of 9 years were included. About 79 % had a positive challenge test outcome. A steep rise in the risk of a positive challenge was observed for specific IgE to each individual component Ana o 1, 2 and 3 with estimated risks up to approximately 100 %. Median values of Ana o 1, 2, 3 were 1. 29 kU/l (range 0 - 100 kU/l), 4. 77 kU/l (range 0 - 100 kU/l) and 8. 33 kU/l (range 0 - 100 kU/l) respectively and varied significantly (p < 0. 001). Specific IgE to Ana o 1, 2 and 3 was better distinguished between cashew-allergic and tolerant children (c = 0. 87, 0. 85 and 0. 89, respectively) than specific IgE to <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> or SPT (c = 0. 76 and 0. 83, respectively).
