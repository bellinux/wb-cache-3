5|$|Wind {{direction}} is usually {{expressed in terms}} of the direction from which it originates. For example, a northerly wind blows from the north to the south. Weather vanes pivot to indicate the direction of the wind. At airports, windsocks indicate wind direction, and {{can also be used to}} estimate wind speed by the angle of hang. Wind speed is measured by anemometers, most commonly using rotating cups or propellers. When a high measurement frequency is needed (such as in research applications), wind can be measured by the propagation speed of ultrasound signals or by the effect of ventilation on the resistance of a heated wire. Another type of anemometer uses pitot tubes that take advantage of the pressure differential between an inner tube and an <b>outer</b> <b>tube</b> that is exposed to the wind to determine the dynamic pressure, which is then used to compute the wind speed.|$|E
25|$|Measurements {{showed that}} the vortex whistle was created by a {{rotating}} asymmetric vortex which created a rotating force vector in {{the plane of the}} exit and a rotating dipole sound field. The phenomenon of swirl instability has been shown to occur in other situations. One was the flow separation on the upper side of delta-shaped airfoils of high speed aircraft (Concorde), The angle of attack of the leading edge resulted in a swirl flow that became unstable. Another is the flow within cyclone separators; the swirling flow there occurs in an annular region between two tubes. The flow reverses at the closed end of the <b>outer</b> <b>tube</b> and exits through the inner tube. Under certain conditions, the flow in the reversal region becomes unstable, resulting in a period rotating force on the <b>outer</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{circulation}} in a Yarrow boiler depended on a temperature {{difference between the}} inner and <b>outer</b> <b>tube</b> rows of a bank, and particularly upon the rates of boiling. Whilst this is easy to maintain at low powers, a higher pressure Yarrow boiler will tend to have less temperature difference and thus will have less effective circulation. Some later and higher-pressure boilers were fitted with external downcomers, outside the heated flue area.|$|E
40|$|High {{pressure}} Raman {{experiments were}} performed on a bundled double-wall carbon nanotubes (DWNTs) up to p = 9. 50 GPa using 532 nm (2. 33 eV) and 632. 8 nm (1. 96 eV) laser excitation energies. The intensity of the radial breathing modes of the <b>outer</b> <b>tubes</b> decreases rapidly but remained observable up to p = 9. 33 GPa, exhibiting a similar behaviour (but less pronounced) to that of single-wall carbon nanotubes which undergo a shape distortion at higher pressures. The inner tubes sustain pressure of atleast 9. 50 GPa. The detailed examination of the Radial breathing mode (RBM) of the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>tubes</b> {{as a function of}} pressure by Raman spectroscopy provides information concerning the pressure response of DWCNTs. The RBM pressure derivatives, dƒçi/dP of the <b>outer</b> <b>tubes</b> are six to ten times larger than those of the inner tubes (6. 3 ¡V 10. 3 vs 1. 5 cm- 1 /GPa) dependent on the laser excitation used. As a consequence, we observed the separation of the tangential modes of the <b>outer</b> <b>tubes</b> from that of the inner ones on pressure increase due to the difference in their pressure derivatives. Upon release of pressure, the Raman peaks are fully reversible with broadening of peaks due to residual pressure-induced deformations present inside the sample. All the above observations evidence that <b>outer</b> <b>tubes</b> in DWNTs act as a protection shield for the inner tube whereas the inner tubes provide the structural stability of the <b>outer</b> <b>tubes</b> upon pressure application.

40|$|The {{pressure}} response of double-wall carbon nanotubes {{has been investigated}} by means of Raman spectroscopy up to 10 GPa.

In addition, the tangential band of the external tubes broadens and decreases in amplitude. The corresponding Raman features of the internal tubes appear to be considerably less sensitive to pressure.

25|$|A molding {{technique}} {{was created by}} Wang et al. for forming a nerve guidance conduit with a multi-channel inner matrix and an <b>outer</b> <b>tube</b> wall from chitosan. In their 2006 study, Wang et al. threaded acupuncture needles through a hollow chitosan tube, where they are {{held in place by}} fixing, on either end, patches created using CAD. A chitosan solution is then injected into the tube and solidified, after which the needles are removed, creating longitudinally oriented channels. A representative scaffold was then created for characterization with 21 channels using acupuncture needles of 400µm in diameter. Upon investigation under a microscope, the channels were found to be approximately circular with slight irregularities; all channels were aligned with the inner diameter of the <b>outer</b> <b>tube</b> wall. It was confirmed by micro-CT imaging that the channels went through {{the entire length of the}} scaffold. Under water absorption, the inner and outer diameters of the scaffold became larger, but the channel diameters did not vary significantly, which is necessary for maintaining the scaffold shape that guides neurite extension. The inner structure provides an increase in compressive strength compared to a hollow tube alone, which can prevent collapse of the scaffold onto growing neurites. Neuro-2a cells were able to growth on the inner matrix of the scaffold, and they oriented along the channels. Although this method has only been tested on chitosan, it can be tailored to other materials.|$|E
25|$|In {{simplest}} form, {{a condenser}} can {{consist of a}} single tube of glass or metal, where the flow of outside air produces the cooling. In a further simple form, condensers consist of concentric glass tubes, with the tube through which the hot gases begin to pass running {{the length of the}} apparatus. The second tube defines an outer chamber through which air, water, or other cooling fluids can pass to reduce the temperature of the gasses to afford the condensation; hence, the <b>outer</b> <b>tube</b> (or, as designs become more complex, outer cooling chamber) has an inlet and an outlet to allow the cooling fluid to enter and exit.|$|E
25|$|An {{internal}} collet {{can be used}} to lock two telescoping tubes together. In {{this case}} the collet {{is in the form of}} a truncated cone drilled and threaded down the centreline. The collet diameter matches the bore of the inner tube, having the larger end slightly greater than the bore while the smaller diameter is slightly less than the bore. A threaded stud, anchored at its other end to the tube, is then used to pull the collet into the tube. The increasing diameter of the collet forces the inner tube to expand and be pushed against the inner wall of the <b>outer</b> <b>tube</b> thus locking the two tubes together. The inner tube is often slotted to facilitate this expansion.|$|E
40|$|We measure {{resonant}} Raman scattering from 11 individual C(60) -derived double-wall carbon nanotubes all having inner semiconducting (6, 5) <b>tubes</b> {{and various}} <b>outer</b> metallic <b>tubes.</b> The Raman spectra show the radial breathing modes (RBM) {{of the inner}} and the <b>outer</b> <b>tubes</b> to be simultaneously in resonance with the same laser energy. We observe that {{an increase in the}} RBM frequency of the inner tubes is related to an increase in the RBM frequency of the <b>outer</b> <b>tubes.</b> The Raman spectra also contain a sharp G(-) feature that increases in frequency as the nominal diameter of the <b>outer</b> metallic <b>tubes</b> decreases. Finally, the one-phonon second-order D-band mode shows a two-way frequency splitting that decreases with decreasing nominal wall-to-wall distance. We suggest that the stress which increases with decreasing nominal wall-to-wall distance is responsible for the hardening that is observed in the frequencies of the RBM, D and G(-) modes of the inner (6, 5) semiconducting tubes. ...|$|R

The intertube spacing between inner and <b>outer</b> <b>tubes</b> of DWNTs was obtained as 0. 36 ± 0. 01 nm.

25|$|Coaxial cables are {{commonly}} used at audio frequencies and above for convenience. A coaxial cable has a conductive wire inside a conductive tube, separated by a dielectric layer. The current flowing {{on the surface of}} the inner conductor is equal and opposite to the current flowing on the inner surface of the <b>outer</b> <b>tube.</b> The electromagnetic field is thus completely contained within the tube, and (ideally) no energy is lost to radiation or coupling outside the tube. Coaxial cables have acceptably small losses for frequencies up to about 5GHz. For microwave frequencies greater than 5GHz, the losses (due mainly to the electrical resistance of the central conductor) become too large, making waveguides a more efficient medium for transmitting energy. Coaxial cables with an air rather than solid dielectric are preferred as they transmit power with lower loss.|$|E
25|$|Various {{types of}} solar {{collectors}} for residential applications {{are available with}} either direct circulation (i.e., heats water and brings it directly to the home for use) or indirect circulation (i.e., pumps a heat transfer fluid through a heat exchanger, which then heats water that flows into the home) systems. In an evacuated tube solar hot water heater with an indirect circulation system, the evacuated tubes contain a glass <b>outer</b> <b>tube</b> and metal absorber tube attached to a fin. Solar thermal energy is absorbed within the evacuated tubes and is converted into usable concentrated heat. Evacuated glass tubes have a double layer. Inside the glass tube is the copper heat pipe. It is a sealed hollow copper tube that contains {{a small amount of}} thermal transfer fluid (water or glycol mixture) which under low pressure boils at a very low temperature. The copper heat pipe transfers thermal energy from within the solar tube into a copper header. As the solution circulates through the copper header, the temperature rises.|$|E

2500|$|The design {{popularized by}} von Liebig thus {{consisted}} of an inner, straight tube {{surrounded by an}} outer straight tube, with the <b>outer</b> <b>tube</b> having ports for fluid inflow and outflow, and with the two tubes sealed in some fashion at the ends (eventually, by a blown glass ring seal). Its simplicity made it convenient to construct and inexpensive to manufacture, the higher heat capacity of the circulating water (vs. air) allowed for maintaining near to constant temperature in the condenser, and so the Liebig type {{proved to be the}} more efficient condenser—capable of condensing liquid from a much greater flow of incoming vapor—and therefore replaced retorts and air condensers. An added benefit of the simplicity of the straight inner tube design of this condenser type is that it can be [...] "packed" [...] with materials that increase the surface area (and so the number of theoretical plates of the distillation column, see section below), e.g., plastic, ceramic, and metal beads, rings, wool, etc. [...] See Fractional Distillation.|$|E

Laser excitation energies used were 1. 96 eV and 2. 33 eV. High pressure on the sample was achieved using a Membrane Diamond Anvil Cell (MDAC). Pressure dependence of the tube’s Raman peaks were investigated in the pressure range 0 to approximately 10 GPa. Both radial (RBM) and tangential (G band) modes were investigated during pressure increase. The overall trend of {{the intensity of the}} Raman signals is that it decreases when pressure is applied. This behavior is most prominent for the metallic <b>outer</b> <b>tubes.</b> The <b>outer</b> <b>tubes</b> are more affected by pressure than the inner tubes, which are proven by their higher derivative of the Raman peak pressure dependence. Investigating the metallic <b>outer</b> <b>tubes</b> under pressure reveals that some anomaly in the pressure dependence around 5 GPa occur for both RBM and G band. Results show that the Raman peaks of those tubes stop shifting to higher frequencies at approximately 5 GPa and start to downshift until they reach a more or less constant value at elevated pressures. Intensity decrease in this pressure region is also prominent. In order to polymerize DWCNTs a heating system was designed and manufactured. The design was chosen with respect to high temperature treatment of the sample in a MDAC.
