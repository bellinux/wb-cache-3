5|$|An {{observance}} is {{held each}} year to remember the victims <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b> An annual marathon draws thousands, and allows runners to sponsor a victim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b> For the tenth anniversary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing,</b> the city held 24days of activities, including a week-long series of events known as the National Week of Hope from April 17 to 24, 2005. As in previous years, the tenth anniversary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> observances began with a service at 9:02a.m., marking the moment the bomb went off, with the traditional 168seconds of silence—onesecond for each person who was killed {{as a result of}} the blast. The service also included the traditional reading of the names, read by children to symbolize the future of Oklahoma City.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing,</b> the U.S. Congress passed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which {{tightened}} {{the standards for}} habeas corpus in the United States, as well as legislation designed to increase the protection around federal buildings to deter future terrorist attacks. On April 19, 2000, the Oklahoma City National Memorial was dedicated {{on the site of}} the Murrah Federal Building, commemorating the victims <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b> Annual remembrance services are held at the same time of day as the explosion occurred.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> of Banski dvori of 7 October, Croatian {{authorities}} instructed the ZNG to assault and capture JNA barracks in the Zagreb area if commanders considered it possible. The instructions {{did not result}} in attacks in Zagreb itself, but JNA barracks in Samobor were captured by Croatian forces on the day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b> The declaration of the independence of Croatia came into force the next day.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing,</b> Nellie Kehoe had become chronically ill with what resembled tuberculosis, {{for which there}} was no {{effective}} treatment or cure.

5|$|Factories, {{ports and}} other {{strategic}} sites {{used by the}} German war effort were frequent targets of Allied bombers from both the British Royal Air Force (RAF) and American United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). Many of these were located in towns and cities, and inaccuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> resulted in substantial civilian casualties.|$|E

5|$|After {{years of}} debate, Bath Township voters {{approved}} {{creation of the}} consolidated school district in 1922, along {{with the increase in}} property taxes to pay for the new school. When the school opened, it had 236 students enrolled in grades 1–12. All area landowners had to pay higher property taxes. At the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing,</b> the village had about 300 residents.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War Waterloo {{station and}} the nearby Thames bridges were a {{significant}} target for Axis bombing, and there were several near-misses on the Necropolis station during the London Blitz of 1940–41. Although there were several interruptions to the Necropolis train service owing to enemy action elsewhere on the line, the Necropolis station was undamaged {{during the early stages}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> campaign, and services generally continued as normal.|$|E
5|$|In 1854, {{the town}} gained borough status and had its first mayor. In the early 20th century Yeovil had around 11,000 {{inhabitants}} and {{was dominated by}} the defence industry, making it a target of German raids during World War II. The worst <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> was in 1940 and continued until 1942. During that time 107 high explosive bombs fell on the town. 49 people died, 68 houses were totally destroyed and 2,377 damaged.|$|E

5|$|On 18 March 1969, on secret {{orders from}} Nixon, the U.S. Air Force {{carried out the}} bombing of Base Area 353 (in the Fishhook region {{opposite}} South Vietnam's Tây Ninh Province) by 59 B-52 Stratofortress bombers. This strike {{was the first in}} a series of attacks on the sanctuaries that lasted until May 1970. During Operation Menu, the Air Force conducted 3,875 sorties and dropped more than 108,000 tons of ordnance on the eastern border areas. Only five high-ranking Congressional officials were informed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b>|$|E
5|$|On May 27, 2016, 2½ {{months before}} the 71st anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombing of Hiroshima that ended World War II, Obama became the first sitting American {{president}} to visit Hiroshima, Japan. Accompanied by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Obama paid tribute to the victims <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum.|$|E
5|$|Scholars today remain {{divided on}} the merits of the {{electronic}} barrier system and the efficacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> campaigns that it directed. The claims of destruction made by the U.S. Air Force, both during and after the war, were originally taken as given. The only exception to this rule was at the CIA, which discounted Air Force claims at the time by as much as 75 percent. This was understandable {{due to the fact that}} the Vietnamese were basically silent during the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E

5|$|The Allies {{were unaware}} of this and mounted further attacks on the site {{as part of the}} United States Army Air Forces {{experimental}} Operation Aphrodite, involving radio-controlled B-24 Liberators packed with explosives. Two such attacks were mounted but failed; in the second such attack, on 12 August, Lt Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.– the elder brother of future US President John F. Kennedy– was killed when the drone aircraft exploded prematurely. By the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> campaign, over 4,100 tons of bombs had been dropped on Mimoyecques, more than on any other V-weapons site.|$|E
5|$|The first attack upon Kobe was by one B-25 bomber {{as a part}} of the Dolittle Raid on 18 April 1942. With Japan's {{success in}} {{expanding}} its territory through south-east Asia at the time, an attack by foreign aircraft was not expected at the time and it was reported that some residents even waved flags at the plane as it flew overhead, thinking it was a Japanese aircraft. One resident of Hyogo ward was the only fatality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> of Kobe on that day.|$|E
5|$|The interdiction campaigns {{were also}} expensive. Igloo White cost around one billion dollars {{per year to}} operate. The cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> {{operations}} that the sensors supported amounted to approximately 18.2million dollars per week. Those costs {{did not include the}} hundreds of aircraft lost during the interdiction campaigns or the priceless crews that manned them.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} {{debate over the}} {{morality}} of the air campaign against Japan since World WarII. During the war the American public approved <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> of Germany and Japan, and {{the few people who}} criticized the raids were seen as unrealistic or even traitors. Some United States government and military personnel believed that the bombing campaign was morally ambiguous, however, but rarely voiced their views publicly.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{announced}} that the British government concurred {{with the use of}} nuclear weapons against Japan, which would be officially recorded as a decision of the Combined Policy Committee. As the release of information to third parties was also controlled by the Quebec Agreement, discussion then turned to what scientific details would be revealed in the press announcement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b> The meeting also considered what Truman could reveal to Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, at the upcoming Potsdam Conference.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} much {{of two years}} at the writer's workshop at the University of Iowa, teaching one course each term, Vonnegut was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for research in Germany. By the time he won it, in March 1967, he was becoming a well-known writer. He used the funds to travel in Eastern Europe, including to Dresden, where he found many prominent buildings still in ruins. At the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing,</b> Vonnegut had not appreciated the sheer scale of destruction in Dresden; his enlightenment came only slowly as information dribbled out, and based on early figures he {{came to believe that}} 135,000 had died there.|$|E
