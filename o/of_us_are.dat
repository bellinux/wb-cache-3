5|$|This is not {{the world}} of Ally McBeal. It is not about finding love remedially. This is {{a world in which}} too many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> asking what use is love if you find it too late. Yet somehow, {{probably}} because the moral judgments are lightly made, superannuated singletons such as myself can look on and see an advertisement for, rather than a warning against, that famously honourable estate—just as we do when we gaze at the more benign marriages of our friends. In Vanity Fair, Thackeray deliberately wrote a novel without a hero. We respond to Cold Feet because it, on the contrary, does not despise its characters.|$|E

Any man’s good when life treats him well, and bad when it treats him badly, and the best <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> the ones the gods love most.|$|E
25|$|The German {{occupation}} of the Czech areas of Czecho-Slovakia on the Ides of March, in total contravention of the Munich Agreement that had been signed {{less than six months}} before, infuriated British and French public opinion and lost Germany all sympathy. Such was the state of public fury that it appeared possible for several days afterwards that the Chamberlain government might fall due to a backbench rebellion. Even Ribbentrop's standard line that Germany was only reacting to an unjust Versailles treaty, and really only wanted peace with everyone, which had worked so well in the past, failed to carry weight. Reflecting the changed mood, the Conservative M.P Alfred Duff Cooper {{wrote in a letter to}} The Times:"Some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> getting rather tired of the sanctimonious attitude which seeks to take upon our shoulders the blame for every crime committed in Europe. If Germany had been left stronger in 1919 she would sooner have been in a position to do what she is doing today". Moreover, the British government had genuinely believed in the German claim that it was only the Sudetenland that concerned them, and that Germany was not seeking to dominate Europe. By occupying the Czech parts of Czecho-Slovakia, Germany lost all credibility with its claim to be only righting the alleged wrongs of Versailles.|$|E

500|$|LGBT social movements, {{which include}} the Gay and Lesbian Rights Movement, Gay Liberation, lesbian feminism, and {{transgender}} activism, have often garnered celebrity endorsement from many entertainers including Jackson. She has often voiced her support for same-sex marriage, advocating all {{people have the right}} to fall in love. In 2008, Jackson appeared in a public service announcement sponsored by the Logo television network and the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) in response to the E.O. Green School shooting. The announcement discusses the murder of fifteen-year-old Lawrence [...] "Larry" [...] King and the safety of LGBT youth in public schools. Jackson states that [...] "none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> safe, until all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> safe". On April 26, 2008, fellow gay icon Ellen DeGeneres presented Jackson with the Vanguard Award at the 19th Annual GLAAD Media Awards at the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles.|$|E

He also wrote or contributed to ten books, and wrote dozens of general music articles and reviews. Many years later, Gray wrote of Heseltine: [...] "In {{the memory of his}} friends, he is as alive now as he ever was when he trod the earth, and so he will continue to be until the last <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> dead".

[...] However, Chicago Sun-Times critic Hedy Weiss noted that the plays five characters were all [...] "identity-warped", and the show was a [...] "minefield... that feels all too deliberately booby-trapped by the playwright." [...] The play won the Jeff Award—honoring excellence in Chicago Theater—for Best New Play in Chicago 2012.|$|E
500|$|With {{his career}} on hold, Hunt {{continued}} recording new songs and demos, posting {{them on his}} MySpace page, while Popular gained exposure among listeners through online music sharing. In 2009, he released the compilation album Use in Case of Emergency as a free download through his website. It featured previously unreleased material recorded by Hunt prior to Popular. He also continued touring, worked on an autobiographical book of short stories, entitled Tales of Friction, and studied classical piano. Hunt also took up photography after his girlfriend purchased him a camera. He started {{out on the streets}} of Los Angeles, where he photographed subjects on street corners and discarded objects, including furniture and numerous couches he found abandoned on the streets. In an interview for PopMatters, he explained how his photographying of people there inspired him: [...] "It's sad as you can quite imagine. It's also kind of welcoming to me. Sometimes I do get {{a chance to talk to}} them and hear a bit of their story. I'm not the only one out here who had an idea of trying to make it happen. Some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> luckier than others. Some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> more prepared than others. That's just the truth of the situation." [...] Along with photography, he was stimulated creatively after reading Legs McNeil's 1997 book Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk and relating to its themes of artistic frustration and rebelliousness.|$|E

Sadier had also said that she read very little Marx. In contrast, Cornelius Castoriadis, a radical political philosopher but strong critic of Marxism, has been cited as a marking influence in Sadier's thinking. Her side project's name (Monade) and its first album's title (Socialisme ou Barbarie) are also references {{to the work of}} Castoriadis.|$|E
