5|$|A {{graduate}} of Carnegie Tech, Morrison {{became interested in}} physics, which he studied at the University of California, Berkeley, {{under the supervision of}} J. Robert Oppenheimer. He also joined the Communist Party. During World War II he joined the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago, where he worked with Eugene Wigner <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|After he {{finished}} his Ph.D. Morrison took a position as an instructor at San Francisco State College. In 1941 he became an instructor at the University of Illinois. In December 1942, with World War II raging around the globe, he was recruited by Robert F. Christy to join the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago in January 1943. There he worked with Eugene Wigner <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> nuclear reactors.|$|E

5|$|Both entrances {{will feature}} the glass canopy design, {{the first of}} their kind in the subway system. They are {{intended}} to stand out aesthetically. The entrances are interweaved with the Hudson Yards developments, with the main entrance wedged between 50 Hudson Yards {{to the east and}} 55 Hudson Yards to the west. The rest of the Hudson Yards development is located very close to the south of the station. Both entrances are based on a design by architect Toshiko Mori, which itself is based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> smaller station entrances in the Paris Métro.|$|E
5|$|By March 1943 Conant {{decided that}} British help would benefit {{some areas of}} the project. In particular, the Manhattan Project could benefit enough from {{assistance}} from James Chadwick, the discoverer of the neutron, and one or two other British scientists to warrant the risk of revealing weapon design secrets. Bush, Conant and Groves wanted Chadwick and Peierls to discuss bomb design with Robert Oppenheimer, and Kellogg still wanted British comments <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the gaseous diffusion plant.|$|E
5|$|Further {{south in}} Mali, the Great Mosque of Djenné, a {{dramatic}} example of Sahel mudbrick architecture. {{was built in}} 1907, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> an earlier Great Mosque first built on the site in 1280. Mudbrick requires maintenance, and the fundamentalist ruler Seku Amadu had let the previous mosque collapse.|$|E
25|$|Green chemistry, {{also called}} {{sustainable}} chemistry, {{is an area}} of chemistry and chemical engineering focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>designing</b> <b>of</b> products and processes that minimize the use and generation of hazardous substances.

5|$|In late 1937, the D-1 series entered production. However, the DB 600Ga engine with 781kW (1,047hp) {{planned for}} this variant was instead {{allocated}} to Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Bf 110 production lines. Heinkel then opted to use Junkers Jumo engines, and the He 111 V6 was tested with Jumo 210 G engines, but was judged underpowered. However, the improved 745kW (999hp) Jumo 211 A-1 powerplant prompted {{the cancellation of}} the D series altogether and concentration <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the E series.|$|E
5|$|James Paine went on {{to design}} three other Thames bridges after Richmond, at Chertsey (1783), Kew (1783), and Walton (1788).

5|$|Reynolds {{received}} his PhD in physics from Princeton in 1943, writing a thesis of {{the propagation of}} shock waves.

5|$|The Grumman XTSF was a {{proposed}} twin-engine torpedo scout aircraft, designed by Grumman for the United States Navy {{towards the end}} of World War II. Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the Grumman F7F Tigercat fighter, enlarged and {{with the addition of a}} bomb bay, the XTSF was deemed too large for carrier operations, and the project was cancelled before any aircraft were built. Instead, the Navy chose to order the single-engine XTB3F, which became the successful AF Guardian.|$|E
5|$|The Hammond-Harwood House in Annapolis, Maryland (illustration) is {{an example}} of Palladian {{architecture}} in the United States. It is the only existing work of colonial academic architecture that was principally designed from a plate in Andrea Palladio’s Quattro Libri.

5|$|With {{the land}} secured, the campus was {{designed}} {{in a way}} to ensure the maximum collaboration between the different sciences, with buildings laid along radial streets emanating from a central circular plaza, which also hosted administrative buildings. The layout of the campus would eventually be used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the university's logo, created by Max Schiefer, which is essentially a simplified map of the core circle of the campus.

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{experience}} gained from the Mark 1, the developers concluded that computers would be used more in scientific roles than pure maths. They therefore embarked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> a new machine which would include a floating point unit; work began in 1951. The resulting machine, which ran its first program in May 1954, was known as Meg, or the megacycle machine. It was smaller and simpler than the Mark 1, as well as quicker at solving maths problems. Ferranti produced a commercial version marketed as the Ferranti Mercury, in which the Williams tubes were replaced by the more reliable core memory.|$|E
5|$|Aymer married twice; {{his first}} marriage, before 1295, was to Beatrice, {{daughter}} of Raoul de Clermont, Lord of Nesle in Picardy and Constable of France. Beatrice died in 1320, and in 1321 he married Marie de St Pol, daughter of Gui de Châtillon, Count of St Pol and Butler of France. He {{never had any}} legitimate children, but he had an illegitimate son, Henry de Valence, whose mother is unknown. Pembroke's most lasting legacy is probably through his second wife, who in 1347 founded Pembroke College, Cambridge. The family arms are still represented on the dexter side of the college arms. Aymer de Valence was buried in Westminster Abbey, where his tomb can still {{be seen as a}} splendid example of late gothic architecture, elaborating <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the nearby tomb of Edmund Crouchback.|$|E
