500|$|Musicologist Dale Cockrell {{argues that}} [...] "Old Dan Tucker" [...] {{represents}} {{a bridge between}} the percussive blackface songs of the 1830s and the more refined compositions of songwriters such as Stephen Foster. Cockrell says that, unlike previous minstrel songs, [...] "Old Dan Tucker" [...] is meant for more than just dancing; its tune is developed enough to stand on its own. Contemporary critics certainly noticed the difference. Y. S. Nathanson called it [...] "the best <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> denominated the ancient negro ballads. The melody is far superior to anything that had preceded it." [...] Nathanson compared the song to works by Gaetano Donizetti and Daniel Auber.|$|E

Columbia {{was the first}} institution that encouraged me to think rather than memorize. My teachers were notable in that many had gained practical engineering experience outside the university {{and were able to}} share their experience with their students. I am grateful, among others, to Professors Morecroft, Hehre, and Arendt. Much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> subsequently learned and accomplished in engineering is based on the solid foundation of principles I learned from them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although his {{journals}} clarify {{some aspects}} of his work and life, Kierkegaard took care not to reveal too much. Abrupt changes in thought, repetitive writing, and unusual turns of phrase are some among the many tactics he used to throw readers off track. Consequently, there are many varying interpretations of his journals. Kierkegaard did not doubt the importance his journals would have in the future. In December 1849, he wrote: [...] "Were I to die now the effect of {{my life would be}} exceptional; much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> simply jotted down carelessly in the Journals would become of great importance and have a great effect; for then people would have grown reconciled to me and would be able to grant me what was, and is, my right." ...|$|E
2500|$|Slater {{realized}} {{that nothing could}} {{be done with the}} machinery as it stood, and convinced Brown of his knowledge. He promised: [...] "If I do not make as good yarn, as they do in England, I will have nothing for my services, but will throw the whole <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> attempted over the bridge." [...] In 1790, he signed a contract with Brown to replicate the British designs. Their deal provided Slater the funds to build the water frames and associated machinery, with a half share in their capital value and the profits derived from them. By December, the shop was operational with ten to twelve workers. By 1791, Slater had some machinery in operation, despite shortages of tools and skilled mechanics. In 1793, Slater and Brown opened their first factory in Pawtucket.|$|E
2500|$|Lloyd's {{career was}} not all laughs, however. [...] In August 1919, while posing for some promotional still {{photographs}} in the Los Angeles Witzel Photography Studio, he was seriously injured holding a prop bomb thought merely to be a smoke pot. It exploded and mangled his hand, causing him to lose a thumb and forefinger. [...] The blast was severe enough that the cameraman and prop director nearby were also seriously injured. Lloyd was {{in the act of}} lighting a cigarette from the fuse of the bomb when it exploded, also badly burning his face and chest and injuring his eye. [...] Despite the proximity of the blast to his face, he retained his sight. As he recalled in 1930, [...] "I thought I would surely be so disabled that I {{would never be able to}} work again. I didn't suppose that I would have one five-hundredth <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> now. Still I thought, 'Life is worth while. Just to be alive. I still think so." ...|$|E

2500|$|Barbara Wootton wrote Freedom under Planning {{after reading}} an early copy of The Road to Serfdom, {{provided}} {{to her by}} Hayek. In the introduction to her book, Wootton mentioned The Road to Serfdom and claimed that [...] "Much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> written is devoted to criticism of the views put forward by Professor Hayek in this and other books." [...] The central argument made in Freedom under Planning is that [...] "there {{is nothing in the}} conscious planning of economic priorities which is inherently incompatible with the freedoms which mean most to the contemporary Englishman or American. Civil liberties are quite unaffected. We can, if we wish, deliberately plan so as to give the fullest possible scope for the pursuit by individuals and social groups of cultural ends which are in no way state-determined." [...] Wootton criticizes Hayek for claiming that planning must lead to oppression, when, in her view, that is merely one possibility among many. She argues that [...] "there seems hardly better case for taking for granted that planning will bring the worst to the top than for the opposite assumption that the seats of office will be filled with angels". Thus, Wootton acknowledges the possibility that planning may exist alongside tyranny, but claims that it is equally possible to combine planning with freedom. She concludes that [...] "A happy and fruitful marriage between freedom and planning can, in short, be arranged." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 24 February 1964, Morris Berthold Abram, the {{president}} of the American Jewish Committee and supported by a United States representative to the United Nation's Commission on Human Rights, brought Kitchko's work to worldwide attention by attacking the book during a press conference. Shortly afterwards, international criticism was leveled at Kitchko and his book. Communist parties worldwide condemned the work. The French communist newspaper, L'Humanit√© denounced the book and demanded the Soviet Union disavow the work. Gus Hall, the secretary-general of the United States Communist Party, stated [...] "there {{is no doubt in my}} mind about the anti-Semitic character <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> seen. Such stereotyped, slanderous caricatures of the Jewish people must be unequivocally condemned." [...] To exploit this discontent with the Soviet Union, the American Central Intelligence Agency had the book translated into French to be distributed to left-wing groups across Europe. When Khrushchev toured Scandinavia, in the spring of 1964, demonstrations took place against the USSR's treatment of Jews, in part motivated by the publication of Judaism Without Embellishment. In the Ukraine, reaction to the book was also negative. Ukrainian nationalist Mykola Lebed saw the book [...] "as a Soviet attempt to paint Ukrainians with a broad anti-Semitic brush". The result was Ukrainians, especially amongst the former supports of Stepan Bandera, switching from using anti-Semitism as a weapon to use against the Soviet authorities to attacking the Soviet Government for being anti-Semitic.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 November, in an {{interview}} with TIME magazine [...] Morsi said of his 22 November constitutional declaration: [...] "If we had a constitution, then all <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> said or done last week, will stop.... when we have a constitution, what I have issued will stop immediately.... The Constituent Assembly of Egypt rushed to finish its work amid widespread protests against Morsi and his declaration. The rush toward a new constitution spurred a walkout among its drafters, i.e. liberals, human rights activists, and others who were unsatisfied with a range of provisions dealing with {{the role of religion in}} the state, the status of women, and the privileges accorded to the country's army. According to the BBC's Jon Leybe the move was designed to preempt a ruling by Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court on 2 December, which might once again dissolve the assembly. The Brotherhood hoped that the decree replaced by a completely new constitution would be approved on a referendum and put an end to the unrest. Low-level rallies continued in Cairo's Tahrir Square on Wednesday. Dozens of police officers, backed by trucks firing tear gas, arrested numerous protesters, some of whom were beaten by officers as others continued to throw stones at police. The Brotherhood organized counter-demonstrations, including one in Egypt's second city, Alexandria, which attracted a few thousand participants. As protests mounted over Morsi's decision to grant himself sweeping powers until the text of the constitution was ratified in a referendum, the panel tasked with writing the constitution wrapped up its deliberations on Wednesday and readied for a vote on Thursday. By 28 November two more people were killed and hundreds more injured. Egypt Independent reported that one of the dead was Fathy Ghareeb, a founder of the Socialist Popular Alliance Party, who died by suffocation caused by the tear gas fired by the Central Security Forces (CSF) in Tahrir Square. Egypt's Court of Cassation, the country's highest appeals court, the Cairo Appeals Court, and other appeals courts suspended their work until Morsi's decree is rescinded.|$|E
