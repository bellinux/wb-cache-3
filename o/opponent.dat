5|$|These {{moves are}} {{designed}} to be used in flurry combinations. For instance, the player can Seismic Slam an <b>opponent,</b> which pulls in enemies, and progress into a Rising Uppercut, which tosses the <b>opponent</b> into the air. During that toss, the player can charge the Rocket Punch and release as the <b>opponent</b> returns to the ground. Alternatively, the player can launch into the air, pick an <b>opponent</b> to slam, and punch them at close range. The character is built for aggressive playstyles and advanced players.|$|E
5|$|Win on time: In {{games with}} a time control, a player wins if the <b>opponent</b> runs out of time, even if the <b>opponent</b> has a much {{superior}} position, {{as long as the}} player still has a theoretical possibility to checkmate the <b>opponent.</b>|$|E

5|$|Like its predecessors, Super Smash Bros. Brawl {{includes}} various {{modes of}} play {{from the previous}} game designed for a single player. Classic mode, as the name implies, is a classical approach to the game, in which players fight individual characters in a selected order. Each match features an arena or <b>opponent</b> from a particular series, such as The Legend of Zelda or Pokémon. Several matches have a unique battle condition, such as a metal <b>opponent,</b> large <b>opponent</b> or a two-on-two team battle. Similar to Classic mode are All Star mode and Boss Battles, where the player has only one life to defeat all of the playable characters and bosses, respectively.|$|E
5|$|One {{particular}} FFR attack, Poison Kiss, has her blow a large heart-shaped kiss at the <b>opponent</b> that {{travels in}} a sine wave path. If it connects, a quick peep show of Poison in several erotic poses is displayed, and afterwards the <b>opponent</b> is shown stunned with hearts dancing over their head. Defeating an <b>opponent</b> with this attack results in Poison doing a pole dance for her win pose, with her whip {{serving as the}} pole. Though not playable in the beta test of Capcom Fighting All Stars, promotional material released by Capcom for the title show that this move would have been retained for her gameplay. However, in Ultra Street Fighter IV, her Poison Kiss follows up with several slaps and a groin kick when it hits the <b>opponent,</b> similar to her Cross Art move from Street Fighter X Tekken.|$|E

5000|$|A correct clinch also {{involves}} the fighter's forearms pressing against the <b>opponent's</b> collar bone while the hands are around the <b>opponent's</b> head {{rather than the}} <b>opponent's</b> neck.

Additionally, the non-dominant clincher can try to [...] "swim" [...] their arm underneath and inside the <b>opponent's</b> clinch, establishing the previously non-dominant clincher as the dominant clincher.|$|R
