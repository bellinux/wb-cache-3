5|$|As {{early as}} the 1920s Antoine Lacassagne, using {{polonium}} provided by his colleague Marie Curie, showed that the element has a specific pattern of uptake in rabbit tissues, with high concentrations, particularly in liver, kidney, and testes. More recent evidence suggests that this behavior results from polonium substituting for its congener sulfur, also in group 16 of the periodic table, in sulfur-containing amino-acids <b>or</b> <b>related</b> molecules and that similar patterns of distribution occur in human tissues. Polonium is indeed an element naturally present in all humans, contributing appreciably to natural background dose, with wide geographical and cultural variations, and particularly high levels in arctic residents, for example.|$|E
5|$|Communication {{between human}} and horse is {{paramount}} in any equestrian activity; to aid this process horses are usually ridden with a saddle {{on their backs}} to assist the rider with balance and positioning, and a bridle <b>or</b> <b>related</b> headgear to assist the rider in maintaining control. Sometimes horses are ridden without a saddle, and occasionally, horses are trained to perform without a bridle or other headgear. Many horses are also driven, which requires a harness, bridle, and some type of vehicle.|$|E

5|$|He {{finds the}} mixture of bird species {{intermediate}} between those of Java and Australia, with 36 species actually Javan, and 11 closely related; while there are only 13 actually Australian, with 35 closely related. Wallace interprets this to mean that {{a small number of}} birds from Australia, and a larger number from Java, colonised Timor and then evolved into new species endemic to the island. The land mammals were very few in number: the six species were endemic <b>or</b> <b>related</b> to those of Java or the Moluccas, with none from Australia, so he doubts there was ever a land bridge to that continent.|$|E
5|$|Many rodent species, {{particularly}} those that are diurnal and social, have {{a wide range of}} alarm calls that are emitted when they perceive threats. There are both direct and indirect benefits of doing this. A potential predator may stop when it knows it has been detected, or an alarm call can allow conspecifics <b>or</b> <b>related</b> individuals to take evasive action. Several species, for example prairie dogs, have complex anti-predator alarm call systems. These species may have different calls for different predators (e.g. aerial predators or ground-based predators) and each call contains information {{about the nature of the}} precise threat. The urgency of the threat is also conveyed by the acoustic properties of the call.|$|E

5|$|The victory {{strengthened}} Muhammad's {{position in}} Medina and dispelled earlier doubts among his followers. As a result, {{the opposition to}} him became less vocal. Pagans {{who had not yet}} converted were very bitter about the advance of Islam. Two pagans, Asma bint Marwan of the Aws Manat tribe and Abu 'Afak of the 'Amr b. 'Awf tribe, had composed verses taunting and insulting the Muslims. They were killed by people belonging to their own <b>or</b> <b>related</b> clans, and Muhammad did not disapprove of the killings. This report, however, is considered by some to be a fabrication. Most members of those tribes converted to Islam, and little pagan opposition remained.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} a {{secondary}} motive for men, especially young males, for learning the agung: the ability to interact with young, unmarried women. Both Maranao and Maguindanao cultures traditionally adhere to Islamic customs which prohibit dating or causal conversation between the opposite sexes (unless married to <b>or</b> <b>related</b> to by blood) and therefore performances such as kulintang music provided the opportunity for such a connection. Among the Maguindanao, the rhythmic modes of duyog and sinulog a kamamatuan allowed agung players to serenade the young, unmarried women on the kulintang. Tidto, the other rhythmic mode, {{could also be used}} but players rarely use this for serenading since the kulintang player is usually an older woman.|$|E

5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} and an essential nutrient that an organism requires in limited amounts. An organic chemical compound (<b>or</b> <b>related</b> set of compounds) {{is called a}} vitamin when the organism cannot synthesize the compound in sufficient quantities, {{and it must be}} obtained through the diet; thus, the term vitamin is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular organism. For example, ascorbic acid (one form of vitamin C) is a vitamin for humans, but not for most other animals. Vitamin D is essential only for people who do not have adequate skin exposure to sunlight, as ultraviolet light promotes synthesis in skin cells. Supplementation is important for the treatment of certain health problems, but there is little evidence of nutritional benefit when used by otherwise healthy people.|$|E
5|$|Before 2000 BC, the Maya spoke {{a single}} language, dubbed proto-Mayan by linguists. Linguistic {{analysis}} of reconstructed Proto-Mayan vocabulary {{suggests that the}} original Proto-Mayan homeland was in the western or northern Guatemalan Highlands, although the evidence is not conclusive. Proto-Mayan diverged during the Preclassic period to form the major Mayan language groups {{that make up the}} family, including Huastecan, Greater K'iche'an, Greater Q'anjobalan, Mamean, Tz'eltalan-Ch'olan, and Yucatecan. These groups diverged further during the pre-Columbian era to form over 30 languages that have survived into modern times. The language of almost all Classic Maya texts over the entire Maya area has been identified as Ch'olan; Late Preclassic text from Kaminaljuyu, in the highlands, also appears to be in, <b>or</b> <b>related</b> to, Ch'olan. The use of Ch'olan as the language of Maya text does not necessarily indicate that it was the language commonly used by the local populace – it may have been equivalent to Medieval Latin as a ritual or prestige language. Classic Ch'olan may have been the prestige language of the Classic Maya elite, used in inter-polity communication such as diplomacy and trade. By the Postclassic period, Yucatec was also being written in Maya codices alongside Ch'olan.|$|E
5|$|Many fungi produce biologically active compounds, {{several of}} which are toxic to animals or plants and are {{therefore}} called mycotoxins. Of particular relevance to humans are mycotoxins produced by molds causing food spoilage, and poisonous mushrooms (see above). Particularly infamous are the lethal amatoxins in some Amanita mushrooms, and ergot alkaloids, which {{have a long history}} of causing serious epidemics of ergotism (St Anthony's Fire) in people consuming rye <b>or</b> <b>related</b> cereals contaminated with sclerotia of the ergot fungus, Claviceps purpurea. Other notable mycotoxins include the aflatoxins, which are insidious liver toxins and highly carcinogenic metabolites produced by certain Aspergillus species often growing in or on grains and nuts consumed by humans, ochratoxins, patulin, and trichothecenes (e.g., T-2 mycotoxin) and fumonisins, which have significant impact on human food supplies or animal livestock.|$|E
