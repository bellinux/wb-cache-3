40|$|The {{prevention}} of "systemic risk " and {{a collapse of}} the banking system is often cited as an <b>objective</b> <b>and</b> <b>rationale</b> for bank regulation and government guarantees, but guarantees and bailouts change the incentives for bank managers and depositors {{and can lead to}} an increase in bank failures and losses. Is the net balance favorable, and what might be done to improve it? The paper distinguishes among three different concepts of how a systemic collapse might occur: a large exogenous shock, a failure of one or a few major banks transmitted by a chain reaction among interconnected institutions, and the failure of one bank providing information causing a reassessment of other similar institutions. A key issue becomes whether market participants do a reasonably accurate job of distinguishing insolvent banks from temporarily illiquid ones; that is an empirical question, and some of the evidence is examined. The final section of the paper looks at ways, for each type of systemic risk, in which bank supervisors might improve the efficiency of their actions. * Loyola University Chicago and Stanford Law School.

40|$|As {{work environments}} become {{more complex and}} demanding, {{organizations}} are becoming more interested in measuring {{the impact of their}} human resource development programs and initiatives. With this increased attention on data and measurement, human resource professionals have been encouraged to utilize data collection and data analysis techniques to make more <b>objective</b> <b>and</b> <b>rationale</b> human capital decisions and to verify business impact. As a result, the human resource profession has seen {{a significant increase in the}} use of surveys to measure anything from training effectiveness to the efficacy of recruitment procedures. The increase in the use of survey instruments requires that more focused attention is placed on the reliability and validity of data from any instrument used to make important human resource and business decisions. One instrument that is currently being used to measure career plateaus and job fit is the Work Perceptions Profile. The purpose of this research study was to conduct a construct validity analysis of the Work Perceptions Profile data and to determine the factor structure of data from its items. The data in this analysis supported a two-factor model structure with the first factor measuring Work Characteristics and a second factor measuring Performance.

The assessment of knowledge, attitude {{and practice in}} relation to oral hygiene among the supportive staff members would help the professional, to inculcate in their patients the acceptable oral habits to thwart oral diseases as these staff members are a bridge between healthcare professional and the patient. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted at a teaching health care institution in South India. The staff members who gave their consent after detailing the <b>objective</b> <b>and</b> <b>rationale</b> {{of the study were}} included in the study. Data were collected about their oral health knowledge, attitude and oral hygiene practices. Descriptive statistics was calculated. Results: Nearly 79 % brushed their teeth only in the morning; 95 % used a tooth brush and toothpaste regularly. Dental floss (0. 5 %) was the least used cleaning aid. About 57 % of the participants visited the dentist only when necessary. The majority of the participants had no reason for not visiting the dentist. 72 % were aware of the role of sugar in causing dental caries, and 55 % were unaware of the role of fluoride in dental caries.

40|$|BACKGROUND The {{scientific}} {{community has been}} re-evaluating the clinical relevance of hysteroscopy in the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} uterine factors and its role in the infertility work-up, thanks to its potential capability to improve reproductive outcomes and reduce time to pregnancy. <b>OBJECTIVE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>RATIONALE</b> The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the efficacy of diagnostic and operative hysteroscopy in improving the live birth rate (LBR) of infertile women, with and without intrauterine abnormalities, at any stage of the infertility work-up. SEARCH METHODS PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library and the Clinical Trials Registry using Medical Subject Headings and free text terms were searched up to June 2014, without language or year restrictions. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) enrolling infertile women with no suspected intrauterine cavity abnormalities and comparing hysteroscopy versus no hysteroscopy at any stage of the diagnostic work-up, but prior to the first attempt of standard IVF or ICSI or after (one or more) failed attempts of IVF/ICSI were included. RCTs enrolling infertile women with intrauterine abnormalities and comparing operative versus diagnostic hysteroscopy were also included. Risk of bias was assessed using the criteria recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration and the overall quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Results were pooled by meta-analysis using the random effect model. OUTCOMES The primary outcome evaluated was the LBR, while secondary outcomes were pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate and procedure-related complications. Five hundred and eighty-eight records were retrieved after removing duplicates. Nine studies were included, with 2976 participants. Four studies included infertile women with one or more failed IVF/ICSI cycles. Two studies included infertile women who were candidates for their first IVF/ICSI. One study included candidates both for first IVF/ICSI and with one or more failed IVF/ICSI cycles. Two studies included infertile women affected by uterine fibroids and endometrial polyps, who had not received IVF/ICSI nor were candidates. Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. Comparing hysteroscopy with no hysteroscopy prior to any (first or subsequent) IVF/ICSI attempt in infertile women without intrauterine abnormalities, there was very low-quality evidence that hysteroscopy increased LBR (relative risk (RR) 1. 48, 95...|$|E

40|$|Studies {{on urban}} {{sustainability}} policy often analyse what it is, could {{or should be}} in terms of contents, <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> <b>rationale.</b> Often neglected, however, is what sustainability discourse actually "does". For this article, we explored the function of sustainability discourse in a collaborative metropolitan governance process of 1998 - 2014 that resulted in an infrastructural strategy aiming for "sustainable growth" in the Gothenburg Metropolitan Area (GMA). We asked why sustainability had become a hegemonic concept in urban politics despite the paradoxical decoupling of <b>objectives,</b> outputs <b>and</b> outcomes from environmental protection and social equity in policy achievement. We argue that sustainability works as a vehicular idea that brings significant value to fragile governance arenas by functioning as a linguistic political mechanism with no essence other than the capability to attract positive affections for any coalition of actors {{with the power to}} mobilise others. In the GMA, sustainability served as a cohesive and mobilising discourse empowering a coalition of technoeconomic experts to "get things done" and make an unruly city region governable enough to develop infrastructure perceived as crucial for the advancement of economic-growth projects.

APE-POLECAT {{comprised}} the inaugural mission of the high-altitude research aircraft, the M- 55 Geophysica, flights by the DLR Falcon, measurements {{from a number of}} Arctic ground stations, and atmospheric modeling. Both aircraft flew out of Rovaniemi in Finland. The Geophysica was equipped with a payload designed to probe the chemistry and microphysics of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) at, or above, the aircraft altitude (up to 20 km geometric altitude). The Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft und Raumfahrt (DLR) Falcon was fitted with an aerosol lidar called OLEX, which looked upward.

Its {{rationales}} are {{the development}} of a database of knowledge on later-life learning and the use of that database as a means of promoting discussion, understanding, recognition and change in later-life learning. This article discusses the <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> <b>rationale</b> of the ForAge database and considers its intended target audiences. In particular, it argues that the database became eclectic, deliberately identifying and drawing on different “kinds” of knowledge.

The article discusses the justification and operational implications of the inclusion of material according to criteria of “relevance, quality and usefulness” and in both English and in other European languages. The article concludes that the database does not reveal the presence in Europe of a significant volume of fundamental research-based knowledge on later-life learning; that much of the knowledge collected is based on the presumption that later-life learning has second-order goals and that the database usefully hedges its bets on what counts as “knowledge” in the field of later-life learning...|$|R
40|$|This paper (i) {{traces the}} {{historical}} origins of foreign aid, (ii) investigates tren­ds in the volume, composition, allocation {{and quality of}} aid flows, and (iii) reviews the empirical literature on aid allocation. The paper concludes that, historically, aid has served a multitude of objectives. For some donors, the allocation and quality of aid have been largely shaped by concern for the development needs of recipients. By contrast, the foreign aid of some larger donors has been used principally as a foreign and commercial policy tool. Yet while this particular character of aid flows may well have impaired the effectiveness of aid, there is no automatic contradiction between donor <b>and</b> recipient <b>objectives.</b> Perhaps the most important change in the aid picture is the reversal after 1992 of the historic upward trend in aid volumes. This {{may not be a}} problem when smaller aid flows are compensated by private flows, as has happened in several developing countries. Yet it may be a problem in low-income countries without access to private capital, which continue to rely on aid for financial resources. The underlying premises of donor-recipient cooperation are very different when aid resources become more limited, especially when debt service is still a factor of significance. The need to keep <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> <b>rationales</b> clear turn out to be even more important. Foreign Aid; Aid Allocation...|$|R
40|$|Introduction]: An {{uncertain}} future Should European Union (EU) member states ‘re-nationalise’ foreign aid? Considering the dismal {{record of the}} aid managed by the European Commission, this is a legitimate question that European leaders nevertheless seem unwilling to address seriously. Like in America, there is heightened debate across Europe on {{the purpose of the}} aid it provides to developing countries. The current debates on poverty reduction, debt relief and, more broadly, the effectiveness of development assistance have brought renewed light on foreign aid [...] This study argues that the root cause of the current state of affairs is linked to the very process of European integration and the birth defects of European foreign aid policy. Europe has never clearly decided whether it wants development aid to be an instrument of its diplomacy or an autonomous policy with its own <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> <b>rationale.</b> Time has probably come to make such a decision. The reform of the aid it provides is a critical dimension of its foreign policy, a dimension often overlooked by the debates on foreign, security and defence policies. It should be a critical component of any meaningful debate on the reform of EU external relations and added on the agenda of the constitutional convention launched in 2002. The main question arising from recent reforms is who will set development co-operation policy and how will it be translated into operational aid strategies. A corollary question is which organisational structure is most appropriate to achieve the EU’s development goals...|$|R

40|$|Socially {{responsible}} investing (SRI) {{has since}} the late 1990 s, grown to become an important concept in the global financial industry. This growth has mainly been led by institutional investors, such as pension funds and sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) who, in the early 2000 s, {{became aware of the}} necessity of behaving as real owners of companies and of adopting a long-term view of investing. As these investors started to embrace SRI, they steered the understanding of SRI away from the original ethical objects of the concept, towards the more loosely defined concepts of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. This development has resulted in that it today does not existing any universal definition or understanding of what SRI actually refers and how it should be understood. This thesis analyzes the responsible investment frameworks of the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), the New Zealand Superannuation Fund (NZSF) and California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), and compares the three funds’ approach to responsible investing. The comparison is done by comparing the <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> <b>rationales</b> behind the responsible investment frameworks, the actors involved in the establishment and development of the frameworks, the management structures and the SRI strategies that the funds apply. The thesis also discusses what can be achieved with responsible investing by applying the GPFG as an example. By doing this, the thesis contributes {{to a better understanding of}} what responsible investing represent to these actors, how SRI is interpreted across various contexts and locations in the word, and whether responsible investors choose to exclude the same type of companies...|$|R

40|$|The {{pivotal role}} of joint {{attention}} as a preverbal indicator of childhood autism {{and as a}} precursor for later language, play, and social development has been noted by many researchers. Despite the wide and varied literature highlighting the importance of joint attention deficits in young autistic children and calling for intervention approaches, {{only a small number}} of intervention studies exist. Few of these studies specifically target joint attention skills. Moreover, the small numbers of studies which directly teach joint attention do not provide sufficient detail to enable replication of the research. Clear <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> <b>rationales</b> for the treatment are missing and often language is not considered as an outcome variable. The proposed research is an attempt to address this problem, and hence explored the impact of systematically promoting joint attention abilities in verbal autistic preschool children to improve later speech and language trajectories. The intervention sessions were explained by providing information on the general approach during intervention and specific sample tasks. Objectives of the intervention followed developmental trajectories of typically developing children and were clarified by providing rationales. A single subject multiple-baseline design across participants was implemented to evaluate intervention effects on four autistic children. It involved measurements taken from videos of each session of the intervention (coding of joint attention) and outcome variables (coding of language). In addition, there were quantitative measures completed with each child at pre-intervention, post-intervention and follow up stages. These involved an Autism Rating Scale and a battery of language measures. The proposed research had the potential to provide a framework for future research relating to specific intervention programs designed to develop joint attention and language skills in autistic children...|$|R
