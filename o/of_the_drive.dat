5|$|After the kickoff, the Hokie offense {{continued}} the lethargy that had characterized its {{play in the}} first half, as Mike Imoh was stopped for no or little gain on consecutive plays before the Hokies were called for a five-yard illegal procedure penalty. On the next play, Florida State capitalized on the momentum it had gained with Reid's punt-return touchdown as defender Pat Watkins intercepted Marcus Vick's pass, returning it to the FSU 44-yard line. Drew Weatherford and the Seminole offense, with the game's momentum firmly in their favor, wasted no time expanding their lead. Weatherford completed a 6-yard pass, then a 21-yard one, and was aided by a 15-yard facemask penalty against Virginia Tech. Deep inside Virginia Tech territory, the third play <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> was a 14-yard touchdown rush by Leon Washington. The speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive,</b> after a nearly scoreless first half, frustrated the Virginia Tech defense, which committed a 15-yard personal foul after the touchdown. The scoring drive had taken just three plays and 54seconds, and gave Florida State a 173 lead with 10:23 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

5|$|After the missed kick, Cincinnati's offense took to {{the field}} at their 20-yard line. The Bearcats {{were not able to}} gain a first down, however, and went three and out before punting back to Virginia Tech. Following the kick, the Hokies started at their 16-yard line. Tech's first play <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> was a 14-yard pass from Taylor to wide {{receiver}} Jarrett Boykin for a first down, but the Hokies were unable to gain another first down. Tech punted back to Cincinnati, and the ball rolled out of bounds at the Cincinnati 30-yard line. The first play <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> resulted in a short loss, but on the second play, Pike completed a 39-yard pass to Gilyard. The play advanced the Bearcats deep into Virginia Tech territory and gave them a first down. Despite the long play, Cincinnati was unable to gain another first down, and Rogers entered the game to attempt a 44-yard field goal. The kick was partially blocked and fell short, denying the Bearcats three points. With 3:07 remaining in the quarter, Cincinnati still held a 7–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{kicked off}} {{following}} the score, and Tech's offense began work from its 18-yard line. Though quarterback Taylor was sacked {{on the first}} play <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive,</b> the Hokies recovered the lost yardage and gained a first down with the final play of the quarter. With one quarter remaining in the game, Tech held a 35–24 lead.|$|E
5|$|Following Florida State's kickoff and a 38-yard return, Virginia Tech's offense {{began work}} at its 45-yard line.

50|$|One way to {{implement}} a parity drive in a RAID array {{is to use the}} exclusive or, or XOR, function. XOR is a Boolean logic function which means 'one or the other, but not both'. <b>The</b> XOR <b>of</b> all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data <b>drives</b> in <b>the</b> RAID array is written to <b>the</b> parity <b>drive.</b> If one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data <b>drives</b> fails, <b>the</b> XOR <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remaining <b>drives</b> is identical to <b>the</b> data <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lost <b>drive.</b> Therefore, when a drive is lost, recovering <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> is as simple as copying <b>the</b> XOR <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remaining <b>drives</b> to a fresh data drive.|$|R

5|$|Following Stanford's post-touchdown kickoff, Virginia Tech's offense {{took the}} field at its 25-yard line and {{embarked}} upon one of its longest drives {{of the game in}} terms of the number of plays. In the first seven plays <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive,</b> quarterback Taylor was the key component. He threw six passes, completing 3 for 39yards, and ran once, for no gain. On the eighth play <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive,</b> running back Ryan Williams gained one yard, then committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty. Tech's drive faltered after the penalty: Taylor threw an incomplete pass, then was sacked for a 16-yard loss, and the Hokies punted to the Stanford 28-yard line.|$|E

5|$|Needing {{to score}} quickly, Virginia Tech's {{subsequent}} drive consisted primarily of pass plays. Marcus Vick quarterbacked {{the first play}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive,</b> but his pass fell incomplete and he was replaced by Bryan Randall on subsequent plays. Randall completed his first three passes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> for 46yards, pushing the Hokies into California territory. Kevin Jones picked up another first down on two rushes, then Randall completed a 28-yard pass to Chris Shreve for a touchdown that cut California's lead to 49–42. The drive took just two minutes off the clock, leaving 4:26remaining in the game. California received the post-touchdown kickoff and went three and out, leaving {{plenty of time for}} a potential game-tying Virginia Tech drive.|$|E

5|$|The Cornhuskers' offense {{returned}} to the field with 4:58 remaining in the third quarter. Nebraska began at its 39-yard line after the kickoff was returned 23 yards. Frost ran four yards, and Benning earned eight yards with two rushes, giving Nebraska a first down at the Tech 49-yard line. Frost's first pass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> fell incomplete, but Benning ran seven yards and Frost completed his second pass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> for nine yards and another first down, this time to the Tech 33-yard line. Three more rushes created 10 more yards and another first down, but a bigger loss came to the Tech defense when Hokie All-American Cornell Brown was injured. Nebraska's offense inexorably pressed onward, aided by a 15-yard pass interference penalty against Virginia Tech, and Nebraska capitalized on a six-yard rush by Benning, giving Nebraska a touchdown with 20 seconds remaining in the quarter. The extra point was good, and Nebraska {{returned to}} a 10-point lead, 3121.|$|E
5|$|Two running plays gained 11 {{yards and}} a first down, then Tennessee quarterback Jonathan Crompton began {{throwing}} the ball. His first pass the game fell incomplete, and his second was intercepted by Virginia Tech defender Rashad Carmichael, who ran {{it back to the}} Tennessee 44-yard line. Tech's second drive of the game thus began in Tennessee's defensive half. The first play <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> was a 20-yard throw from Taylor to wide receiver Jarrett Boykin. That completed pass was the longest play <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive,</b> which continued through short rushes and passes. On the seventh play after the interception, Williams ran the ball forward one yard, crossing the goal line for the game's first touchdown. Tech placekicker Matt Waldron successfully converted the extra point, and with 6:56 remaining in the first quarter, Tech led 7-0.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} the post-touchdown kickoff, Auburn {{began to run}} out the clock. The Tigers failed {{to pick up a}} first down, and after going three and out, punted the ball back to Virginia Tech. The Hokies started their drive at their two-yard line, and Randall began it successfully by completing a 20-yard pass, rushing for 10yards, then completing a five-yard pass to bring the Hokies near midfield. On the fourth play <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive,</b> however, Randall was intercepted by Auburn's Derrick Graves. The Tigers, their offense again on the field, began running out the clock again. Tech attempted to interrupt Auburn's clock management by calling timeouts after each play, stopping the clock with each timeout. Virginia Tech forced Auburn into a three and out, and the Tigers again punted the ball away with 2:13 remaining.|$|E
5|$|After {{the ball}} {{rolled into the}} end zone for a touchback, Virginia Tech began its final drive at its 20-yard line. On the first play <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive,</b> Bryan Randall {{completed}} an 80-yard touchdown pass to Josh Morgan. The score plus the extra point cut Auburn's lead to 16–13. With time in the game almost exhausted, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an onside kick {{in order to have a}} chance to get another offensive drive. Because the Hokies had used their final timeouts to stop the clock on Auburn's previous drive, Auburn would be free to run out the game's final minutes. Despite the hopes of Virginia Tech for a last-second miracle, the Auburn Tigers recovered the kick, allowing them to run out the clock and clinch a 16–13 victory.|$|E

5|$|As in the {{previous}} two drives, Virginia Tech relied upon its rushing offense: The first five plays <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> were runs by David Wilson, who gained 26 yards. The Hokies then switched gears, surprising Tennessee, whose defense allowed a 30-yard pass completion from Taylor to Boykin. Tech reverted to running plays, but Tennessee again allowed a long gain, as Roberts advanced 21 yards on a run, then Wilson ran three yards into the end zone. The touchdown and extra point gave Virginia Tech a 34-14 lead with 5:14 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|Because Florida State {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Running back David Wilson returned the opening kickoff to the Tech 21-yard line, and the Hokies' offense began the first drive of the second half. The first play of the quarter was a 14-yard pass from Taylor to Coale, beginning a seven-play, 67-yard drive resulting in a touchdown. The culminating play <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> was a 45-yard pass from Taylor to Coale for the touchdown, which extended Tech's lead to 11 points, 28–17, at the 11:24 mark of the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Because Tech {{committed}} a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty following the touchdown, NC State {{was able to}} acquire good field position during the kickoff return, starting their drive at their 44-yard line. On the second play <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive,</b> Erik Kramer completed an 18-yard pass to Nasrallah Worthen, driving State into the Tech side of the field. After a short play, Kramer again completed a long pass, this time to Bobby Crumpler for 24yards. Now inside the Tech red zone, Kramer was tackled for a big loss, losing some of the yardage that he had gained with the previous play. NC State was unable to pick up another first down and sent in Mike Cofer to attempt a 33-yard kick, which was successfully completed. The field goal regained NC State a 2422 lead.|$|E
