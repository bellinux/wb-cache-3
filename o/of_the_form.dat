5|$|A villanelle (also {{known as}} villanesque) is a nineteen-line poetic form {{consisting}} of five tercets {{followed by a}} quatrain. There are two refrains and two repeating rhymes, with {{the first and third}} line of the first tercet repeated alternately until the last stanza, which includes both repeated lines. The villanelle {{is an example of a}} fixed verse form. The word derives from Latin, then Italian, and is related to the initial subject <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> being the pastoral.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} forms {{with a long}} history in many languages, many {{variations}} have been developed, including forms with a quasi-musical poetic diction in Urdu. Ghazals have a classical affinity with Sufism, and a number of major Sufi religious works are written in ghazal form. The relatively steady meter {{and the use of the}} refrain produce an incantatory effect, which complements Sufi mystical themes well. Among the masters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> is Rumi, a 13th-century Persian poet.|$|E

50|$|Plato {{believed}} that long before our bodies ever existed, our souls existed and inhabited heaven, where they became directly acquainted with <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> themselves. Real knowledge, to him, was knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms.</b> But knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> cannot be gained through sensory experience because <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> {{are not in}} the physical world. Therefore, our real knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> must be <b>the</b> memory <b>of</b> our initial acquaintance with <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> in heaven.

5|$|E. Midy {{proved a}} general result about such fractions, now called Midy's theorem, in 1836. The {{publication}} was obscure, {{and it is}} unclear if his proof directly involved 0.999..., {{but at least one}} modern proof by W. G. Leavitt does. If it can be proved that a decimal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> 0.b1b2b3... is a positive integer, then it must be 0.999..., which is then the source of the 9s in the theorem. Investigations in this direction can motivate such concepts as greatest common divisors, modular arithmetic, Fermat primes, order of group elements, and quadratic reciprocity.|$|E
5|$|Evolution {{influences}} {{every aspect}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> and behaviour of organisms. Most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical adaptations {{that are the}} outcome of natural selection. These adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food, avoiding predators or attracting mates. Organisms can also respond to selection by cooperating with each other, usually by aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial symbiosis. In the longer term, evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed.|$|E

Through the 1970s lenong was performed at Ismail Marzuki Hall, drawing considerable audiences, and several lenong performers found mainstream acclaim in the film industry.|$|E
5|$|The Gaussian {{integers}} {{are complex}} numbers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> α=u+vi, where u and v are ordinary integers and i is the square root of negative one. By defining an analog of the Euclidean algorithm, Gaussian integers {{can be shown}} to be uniquely factorizable, by the argument above. This unique factorization is helpful in many applications, such as deriving all Pythagorean triples or proving Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares. In general, the Euclidean algorithm is convenient in such applications, but not essential; for example, the theorems can often be proven by other arguments.|$|E

Two subspecies have been described, although there are doubts regarding the distinctiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> gracilipes from Culebra Island, extinct since 1912.

Thiers and Sundberg classified {{it in the}} section Ponderosa of genus Armillaria due to its inamyloid spores, but noted that its relationship to other species was unclear.

25|$|The {{fundamental}} theorem of arithmetic {{continues to}} hold in unique factorization domains. An {{example of such a}} domain is the Gaussian integers Z, that is, the set of complex numbers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> a+bi where i denotes the imaginary unit and a and b are arbitrary integers. Its prime elements are known as Gaussian primes. Not every prime (in Z) is a Gaussian prime: in the bigger ring Z, 2 factors into the product of the two Gaussian primes (1+i) and (1−i). Rational primes (i.e. prime elements in Z) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> 4k+3 are Gaussian primes, whereas rational primes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> 4k+1 are not.|$|E
