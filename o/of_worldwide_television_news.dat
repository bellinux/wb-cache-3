(Communication Studies) The aim of {{this study}} is to develop {{attitudinal}} scales with which expectations of the viewers of television in Namibia regarding <b>television</b> <b>news</b> as well as the perceived nature of <b>television</b> <b>news</b> in 1990 may be measured. The television viewership of the "Namibian Broadcasting Corporation" (NBC), representing all Namibians regardless of ethnic grouping in posession of television licenses, was used asuniversum. The data obtained may be used to develop a <b>television</b> <b>news</b> model which may satisfy the majority of the population of Namibia. A systems approach was used in this process. The study of <b>television</b> <b>news</b> on a macro-level can best be explained utilising a systems model. A systems model through which an attempt is made to explain the audio-visual transmission of information was thus developed. This model may be applied to television systems within any society. It was found that television is the primary source of news for a majority of targeted viewers. According to the viewers, NBC <b>television</b> <b>news</b> closely approaches an authoritarian <b>television</b> <b>news</b> model. Viewers' expectations are generally not satisfied through NBC <b>television</b> <b>news</b> contents or the visual presentation thereof. It was established that NBC television does not function independently of the government and is neither completely objective nor credible. Generally viewers indicated their expectations of a <b>television</b> <b>news</b> model which should contain elements of a western <b>television</b> <b>news</b> model.

Drawing on wider positions of contemporary social and political theory, it is demonstrated how the `communicative frames' deployed by Indian broadcasters are consequential for the public deliberation and display of conflicts and cultures and we systematically compare these with the communicative frames deployed by <b>television</b> <b>news</b> in five other countries. The article identifies, maps and pursues into the production domain the repertoire of `communicative frames' characterizing Indian <b>television</b> <b>news</b> today and reveals important differences between the public broadcaster Doordarshan and the private network NDTV 24 × 7 {{as well as between}} Indian <b>television</b> <b>news</b> and <b>television</b> <b>news</b> internationally.

500|$|Two November 1993 [...] "Zoomerang" [...] {{shows in}} Sydney were filmed as part <b>of</b> a <b>worldwide</b> <b>television</b> broadcast. The 26 November show {{was to be}} a {{rehearsal}} for the production crew for the official filming the following night. However, Clayton, who began drinking excessively on the latter stages of the tour, suffered an alcoholic blackout from the previous night and was unable to perform. Bass guitar technician Stuart Morgan filled in for him, marking the first time any member of U2 had missed a show. Clayton recovered in time to play the 27 November show, which was broadcast and was the only show used in the resulting video release. The concert was broadcast in the United States on tape-delayed pay-per-view. U2 originally planned to produce the concert with MTV for a January 1994 [...] "triplecast" [...] that would have offered three different perspectives of the show on three separate channels. However, the group cancelled the [...] "triplecast" [...] after realising they had not fully developed the concept.

Nineteen professors in Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan sorted Q statements regarding the quality of local <b>television</b> <b>news.</b> An analysis of their Q sorts found the participants fell into three categories: the Ultra-Critics, the Moderate-Critics, and the Minimal-Critics.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} and {{assesses the}} development of the UK <b>television</b> <b>news</b> industry during the period 1982 - 1998. Its aim is to ascertain {{the degree to which a}} market for <b>television</b> <b>news</b> has developed, how such a market operates, and how it coexists with the 'public service' goals of news provision. A major purpose of the research is to investigate whether 'the market' and 'public service' requirements have to be the conceptual polarities they are commonly supposed to be in much media academic analysis of the <b>television</b> <b>news</b> genre. It has conducted such an analysis through an examination of the development strategies ofthe major news organisations of the BBC, ITN and Sky News, and an assessment of the changes that have taken place to the structure of the news industry as a whole. It places these developments within the determining contexts of Government economic policy and broadcasting regulation. The research method employed was primarily that of the in-depth interview with <b>television</b> <b>news</b> management, politicians and regulators: in other words, those instrumental in directing the strategic development within the <b>television</b> <b>news</b> industry. Its main findings are that there has indeed been a development of market activity within the <b>television</b> <b>news</b> industry, but that the amount of this activity has been limited by the particular economic attributes of the <b>television</b> <b>news</b> product. What makes the provision of <b>television</b> <b>news</b> a worthwhile venture for news organisations is the degree to which <b>television</b> <b>news</b> confers status and political legitimacy upon its provider.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship the <b>television</b> <b>news</b> sequence at four-year colleges and universities has with the employment marketability of those students who major in <b>television</b> <b>news.</b> Both vocational and academic approaches were examined. Three factors were taken into consideration: if the completion of any <b>television</b> <b>news</b> curriculum aids in the <b>television</b> <b>news</b> graduate's employment marketability, if the <b>television</b> <b>news</b> curriculum has merit when weighed against work experience without completion of such a discipline, and if another academic sequence might better prepare the aspiring television journalist. The study is significant in that the field of <b>television</b> <b>news</b> has been glutted {{in recent years by}} an influx of graduates who believe that the work is glamorous and exciting. Many graduates lack the basic verbal and mechanical skills to compete in the job marketplace. The first two chapters discuss the research problem and the factors comprising it. Details of the research design follow, dividing the study into an assessment of the problem and the analysis of the results of a questionnaire that was mailed to 213 <b>television</b> <b>news</b> anchors selected through a stratified random process. A background chapter on various <b>television</b> <b>news</b> curricula is included, with numerous books and periodicals cited.
