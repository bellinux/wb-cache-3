5|$|The Persian army {{seems to}} have made slow {{progress}} through Thrace and Macedon. News of the imminent Persian approach eventually reached Greece in August thanks to a Greek spy. At {{this time of year}} the Spartans, de facto military leaders of the alliance, were celebrating the festival of Carneia. During the Carneia, military activity was forbidden by Spartan law; the Spartans had arrived too late at the Battle of Marathon because of this requirement. It was also the time of the Olympic Games, and therefore the <b>Olympic</b> <b>truce,</b> and thus it would have been doubly sacrilegious for the whole Spartan army to march to war. On this occasion, the ephors decided the urgency was sufficiently great to justify an advance expedition to block the pass, under one of its kings, Leonidas I. Leonidas took with him the 300 men of the royal bodyguard, the Hippeis. This expedition was to try to gather as many other Greek soldiers along the way as possible and to await the arrival of the main Spartan army.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, the UN General Assembly {{granted the}} IOC Permanent Observer status. This {{decision}} enables the IOC {{to be directly}} involved in the UN Agenda and to attend UN General Assembly meetings where it can take the floor. This has provided the possibility to promote sport at a new level. In addition, in 1993, the UN General Assembly approved a Resolution that further solidified IOC–UN cooperation with the decision to revive the <b>Olympic</b> <b>Truce,</b> by adopting a Resolution entitled “Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal,” which calls upon Member States to observe the <b>Olympic</b> <b>Truce</b> before every iteration of the games, and to cooperate with the IOC and the International Paralympic Committee in their efforts to use sport as a tool to promote peace, dialogue and reconciliation in areas of conflict during and beyond the period of the Olympic and Paralympic Games.|$|E

25|$|During the <b>Olympic</b> Games, a <b>truce,</b> or ekecheiria was observed. Three runners, {{known as}} spondophoroi were sent from Elis to the {{participant}} cities at {{each set of}} games to announce {{the beginning of the}} truce. During this period, armies were forbidden from entering Olympia and legal disputes {{and the use of the}} death penalty were forbidden. The truce was primarily designed to allow athletes and visitors to travel safely to the games and was, for the most part, observed. Thucydides wrote of a situation when the Spartans were forbidden from attending the games, and the violators of the truce were fined 2,000 minae for assaulting the city of Lepreum during the period of the ekecheiria. The Spartans disputed the fine and claimed that the truce had not yet taken hold.|$|R
500|$|The Ancient Olympic Games were {{religious}} and athletic festivals held {{every four years}} at the sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia, Greece. Competition was among representatives of several city-states and kingdoms of Ancient Greece. These Games featured mainly athletic but also combat sports such as wrestling and the pankration, horse and chariot racing events. It has been widely written that during the Games, all conflicts among the participating city-states were postponed until the Games were finished. This cessation of hostilities {{was known as the}} <b>Olympic</b> peace or <b>truce.</b> This idea is a modern myth because the Greeks never suspended their wars. The truce did allow those religious pilgrims who were travelling to Olympia to pass through warring territories unmolested because they were protected by Zeus. The origin of the Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend; {{one of the most popular}} myths identifies Heracles and his father Zeus as the progenitors of the Games. According to legend, it was Heracles who first called the Games [...] "Olympic" [...] and established the custom of holding them every four years. The myth continues that after Heracles completed his twelve labours, he built the Olympic Stadium as an honour to Zeus. Following its completion, he walked in a straight line for 200 steps and called this distance a [...] "stadion" [...] ( [...] , Latin: stadium, [...] "stage"), which later became a unit of distance. The most widely accepted inception date for the Ancient Olympics is 776BC; this is based on inscriptions, found at Olympia, listing the winners of a footrace held every four years starting in 776BC. The Ancient Games featured running events, a pentathlon (consisting of a jumping event, discus and javelin throws, a foot race, and wrestling), boxing, wrestling, pankration, and equestrian events. Tradition has it that Coroebus, a cook from the city of Elis, was the first Olympic champion.|$|R

25|$|The IOC {{declined}} {{the request for}} a minute of silence at the opening ceremony, but IOC officials honoured the victims at a ceremony organised by the Israeli embassy and the Jewish community in London during the Olympics on August 6, 2012. A further ceremony was planned in Germany {{on the anniversary of}} the attack on September 5, 2012 at the military airfield of Fürstenfeldbruck. IOC President Rogge led a spontaneous minute of silence during a ceremony on July 23, 2012 which promoted the <b>Olympic</b> <b>truce,</b> marking the first time ever that the IOC honored the Israeli victims in a ceremony inside an Olympic village.|$|E
25|$|While many events {{took place}} in Lillehammer, skating {{took place in}} Hamar, some ice hockey matches were placed in Gjøvik, while Alpine skiing was held in Øyer and Ringebu. Sixty-seven {{countries}} and 1,737 athletes participated in six sports and sixty-one events. Fourteen countries made their debut in the Winter Olympics, of which nine were former Soviet republics. The Games also saw the introduction of stricter qualifying rules, {{reducing the number of}} under-performing participants from warm-weather countries. New events were two new distances in short track speed skating and aerials, while speed skating was moved indoors. Nearly two million people spectated the games, which were the first to have the <b>Olympic</b> <b>truce</b> in effect. The games were succeeded by the 1994 Winter Paralympics from 10 to 19 March.|$|E
25|$|During {{the celebration}} of the games, an <b>Olympic</b> <b>Truce</b> was enacted so that athletes could travel from their cities to the games in safety. The prizes for the victors were olive leaf wreaths or crowns. The games became a {{political}} tool used by city-states to assert dominance over their rivals. Politicians would announce political alliances at the games, and in times of war, priests would offer sacrifices to the gods for victory. The games were also used to help spread Hellenistic culture throughout the Mediterranean. The Olympics also featured religious celebrations. The statue of Zeus at Olympia was counted as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Sculptors and poets would congregate each olympiad to display their works of art to would-be patrons.|$|E

2500|$|A record 67 nations {{participated in}} the 1994 Winter Olympic Games. The Games were the first {{following}} the implementation of stricter qualifying standards, which prevented low-performing athletes from competing without meeting minimum standards. As a consequence, eleven [...] "warm-weather countries" [...] signed up {{to participate in the}} Games, but were ultimately absent as none of their athletes succeeded in qualifying. The number of African athletes fell from nineteen in 1992 to three in 1994. These rules were, however, not applied to bobsled events, enabling the United States Virgin Islands, Monaco, Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica to compete in that sport. On 25 October 1993, the United Nations General Assembly urged its members to observe the <b>Olympic</b> <b>truce</b> from seven days before to seven days after the Olympic games, making the Lillehammer games the first to observe the truce. IOC appealed for a truce in the ongoing Bosnian War and the Siege of Sarajevo, the city that had hosted the 1984 Winter Olympics.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the refusal}} to honour the victims during the opening {{ceremony}} of the Olympics, on July 23 IOC President Jacques Rogge led a minute of silence during a ceremony which promoted the <b>Olympic</b> <b>truce.</b> This {{was the first time}} that the IOC honoured the Israeli victims in a ceremony inside an Olympic village. Rogge started by “honoring the memory of the 11 Israeli Olympians who shared the ideals that have brought us together in this beautiful Olympic village" [...] and said that the Israelis “came to Munich in the spirit of peace and solidarity.” [...] Rogge added, [...] "we owe it to them to keep that spirit alive and to remember them.” In response to Rogge's spontaneous minute of silence, Ilana Romano, the widow of Israeli weightlifter Yossef Romano, said, [...] "He is trying to do the bare minimum,” and called it [...] "shameful." [...] Ankie Spitzer, the widow of Israeli coach Andrei Spitzer, also criticized Rogge, saying, “This is not the right solution, to hold some ceremony in front of 30 or 40 people. We asked for a moment of silence at the opening ceremony, not for someone to mumble something in front of a few dozen people.” At the London commemoration on August 6, Romano told Rogge he had [...] "submitted to terrorism", and would be [...] "written down on the pages of history as ... a president who violated the Olympic charter calls for brotherhood, friendship and peace." [...] Their attacks were applauded by the audience, but afterwards some attendees privately expressed discomfort at the sustained attack on Rogge, and Andrew Gilbert, formerly chair of Limmud International tweeted that “the memorial service for Munich 11 became an anti-IOC rally and heavy-handed humiliation of Rogge".' ...|$|E
