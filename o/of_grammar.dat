5|$|Some {{proponents of}} Saussure's view of {{language}} have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying its basic elements {{and then by}} presenting a formal account of the rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent of such a theory is Noam Chomsky, the originator of the generative theory <b>of</b> <b>grammar,</b> who has defined language as the construction of sentences that can be generated using transformational grammars. Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate feature {{of the human mind}} and to constitute the rudiments of what language is. By way of contrast, such transformational grammars are also commonly used to provide formal definitions of language are commonly used in formal logic, in formal theories <b>of</b> <b>grammar,</b> and in applied computational linguistics. In the philosophy of language, the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as Alfred Tarski, Bertrand Russell, and other formal logicians.|$|E

5|$|Dialectologists {{identify}} many English dialects, {{which usually}} refer to regional varieties {{that differ from}} each other in terms of patterns <b>of</b> <b>grammar,</b> vocabulary, and pronunciation. The pronunciation of particular areas distinguishes dialects as separate regional accents. The major native dialects of English are often divided by linguists into the two extremely general categories of British English (BrE) and North American English (NAE). There also exists a third common major grouping of English varieties: Southern Hemisphere English, the most prominent being Australian and New Zealand English.|$|E

50|$|The 1970 {{framework}} for language variability {{did not include}} a theory of language systems. In 1972, Lieb began work on a general syntax as part of a theory of language systems.

In the Integrational Theory <b>of</b> <b>Grammars,</b> the traditional modern conception <b>of</b> <b>grammars</b> as algorithms was rejected in favour of a conception that has later become known as 'declarative grammar'. The integrational format <b>of</b> <b>grammars</b> construed as empirical axiomatic theories (Lieb 1974, 1976) is also characterized in Lieb (1983: Part G), and more briefly in Lieb (1989).|$|R
5|$|In the High Middle Ages, {{new sources}} of {{education}} arose. Choir and grammar schools were designed to train priests, with an emphasis respectively on music and Latin grammar. The reorganisation of the church {{that began in the}} reign of David I (1124–53) gave the church a clearer diocesan and parochial structure, meaning that the seats of sheriffdoms, such as Perth, received schools that were usually under monastic patrons. Early examples <b>of</b> <b>grammar</b> schools include the High School of Glasgow in 1124 and the High School of Dundee in 1239. These were usually attached to cathedrals or a collegiate church. The newly created diocesan chancellors may have had authority over cathedral schools and schoolmasters within their diocese.|$|E
5|$|Urban elites {{throughout}} the Empire shared a literary culture embued with Greek educational ideals (paideia). Hellenistic cities sponsored schools {{of higher learning}} {{as an expression of}} cultural achievement. Young men from Rome who wished to pursue the highest levels of education often went abroad to study rhetoric and philosophy, mostly to one of several Greek schools in Athens. The curriculum in the East was more likely to include music and physical training along with literacy and numeracy. On the Hellenistic model, Vespasian endowed chairs <b>of</b> <b>grammar,</b> Latin and Greek rhetoric, and philosophy at Rome, and gave teachers special exemptions from taxes and legal penalties, though primary schoolmasters did not receive these benefits. Quintilian held the first chair <b>of</b> <b>grammar.</b> In the eastern empire, Berytus (present-day Beirut) was unusual in offering a Latin education, and became famous for its school of Roman law. The cultural movement known as the Second Sophistic (1st–3rd century AD) promoted the assimilation of Greek and Roman social, educational, and aesthetic values, and the Greek proclivities for which Nero had been criticized were regarded from the time of Hadrian onward as integral to Imperial culture.|$|E
5|$|Alexandre Baudrimont's 40-page study Vocabulaire de la langue des Bohémiens habitant {{les pays}} basques français of 1862, the most {{extensive}} of the early accounts, covers both vocabulary and aspects <b>of</b> <b>grammar.</b> He worked with two female informants, {{a mother and her}} daughter from the Uhart-Mixe area near Saint-Palais, whom he describes as highly fluent. Unfortunately, he was only able to conduct a single session as the women were then told not to cooperate further for the fear of outsiders prying into the secrets of the Romani. There is a certain degree of confusion in Baudrimont's publication—he himself states that he could not always be certain the correct forms were elicited. For example, most of the verb forms he tried to elicit lack the verbal -tu ending and appear to be participles.|$|E

5|$|In medieval Scotland {{education}} {{was dominated by}} the Church and largely aimed at the training and education of clerics. In the later medieval period {{there was a general}} increase in the numbers of educational institutions as well as increasing use by the laity. These included private tuition in the families of lords and wealthy burghers, song schools attached to most major churches and an increasing number <b>of</b> <b>grammar</b> schools, particularly in the expanding burghs. These were almost exclusively aimed at boys, {{but by the end of}} the 15th century Edinburgh also had schools for girls. The growing emphasis on education cumulated with the passing of the Education Act 1496, which decreed that all sons of barons and freeholders of substance should attend grammar schools. All this resulted in an increase in literacy, but which was largely concentrated among a male and wealthy elite, with perhaps 60 per cent of the nobility being literate by the end of the period.|$|E
5|$|In {{opposition}} to the formal theories of the generative school, functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. Formal theories <b>of</b> <b>grammar</b> seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they {{relate to each other}} as systems of formal rules or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out. The framework of cognitive linguistics interprets language in terms of the concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.|$|E

50|$|Over {{the past}} decades, IL has {{developed}} two major linguistic theories: (i) a {{general theory of}} language (the Integrational Theory of Language) that covers both the systematic features of language systems and the phenomenon of language variability in a unified way, and (ii) a theory <b>of</b> <b>grammars</b> (the Integrational Theory <b>of</b> <b>Grammars),</b> understood {{as part of a}} theory of linguistic descriptions. The separation of a theory of language from a theory <b>of</b> <b>grammars</b> is a major feature of IL by which it differs from approaches with a generative orientation. After an initial emphasis on the Integrational Theory <b>of</b> <b>Grammars</b> till the mid-1970s, work in IL has been characterized by a steady and continuous refinement of the Integrational Theory of Language based on empirical data from typologically diverse languages, avoiding basic revisions as they occurred in Chomskyan Generative Grammar.|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} years {{there have been}} many {{attempts}} to fill in the gap between the classes of LL(k) and LR(k) grammars with new classes <b>of</b> deterministically parsable <b>grammars.</b> Almost always the introduction of a new class was accompanied by a parsing method and/or a grammatical transformation fitting the following scheme. If parsers were at the centre of the investigation the new method used to be designed to possess certain advantages with respect to already existing ones. As far as transformations were concerned the intention was to produce methods <b>of</b> transforming <b>grammars</b> into "more easily" parsable ones. The problem of finding classes <b>of</b> context-free <b>grammars</b> which can be transformed to LL(k) grammars has received much attention. Parsing strategies and associated classes <b>of</b> <b>grammars</b> generating LL(k) languages have been extensively studied.
