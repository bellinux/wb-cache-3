5|$|A US {{version of}} the music video was {{directed}} by Tim Hope. The video employs a dream-like animated world, with woodland glades, cartoon flowers which bloom instantly and the air full of clockwork-like insects and birds, but with real people embedded within it. On top of a mountain, a woman (Nerys Davies) waters plants inside a house. The band are aboard a horse carriage that travels through a rural landscape. A small coloured bird flies from the carriage up to the house, lands on the woman's windowsill and flaps its wings as if delivering a message. It transforms into a crow and then into a huge black menacing bird. The bird flies over the house and turns into a black cloud, which pours rain onto the land. The rain burns holes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> it falls on, and crow feathers protrude from the holes. Finally a tornado lifts up the house, spinning it across the sky and then dropping it precisely on a normal suburban street. The video's acclaimed visuals earned Hope an MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction in 2002. It was also nominated for Breakthrough Video.|$|E

He said, [...] "We {{will not}} allow people to separate us from the United States of America {{in dealing with the}} common challenges that we face around the world. I think people have got to remember that the relationship between Britain and America and between a British prime minister and an American president is built <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that we share, the same enduring values about the importance of liberty, opportunity, the dignity of the individual.

500|$|According to American critic Robert Christgau, Maxinquayes groove-oriented and low-tempo music drew {{not only}} on dub but also on lo-fi, ambient techno, and hip hop, while James Hunter from Rolling Stone said Tricky subsumed American hip hop, soul, reggae, and 1980s English rock sounds into [...] "a mercurial style of dance music". Entertainment Weekly critic David Browne {{classified}} the music as an intellectual form of R. Ben Walsh of The Independent called it an experimental album featuring a [...] "heady blend" [...] of soul, rock, punk, hip hop, dub, and electronica. In Tricky's own words, he composed his songs based on a particular sound he liked rather than having a definite song structure in mind: [...] "I couldn't write you a blues track or a hip-hop track if you asked. I just make what I hear and then me and Martina sing all the words on paper, putting the emphasis <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that perhaps shouldn't be sung." [...] Tricky had no concept of pitch, regard for notational conventions and time signatures, or previous experience with sampling, but his approach for Maxinquaye challenged Saunders to rethink his ideas about music production and experiment in ways he had never tried before. Saunders recalled being asked to combine samples of two songs that were 30 beats per minute apart and composed in entirely different keys: [...] " [...] thought differently to anybody I've ever known ... It didn't occur to me that by de-tuning one to slow it down, both might then gel musically at that point. I always think of it like going into a scrapyard and building a car {{out of all the}} bits you can find. You could probably build a car that would work, and although it might be the ugliest you've ever seen, it would have loads of character." ...|$|E
500|$|The glamorous {{world of}} Hollywood also {{reflected}} in her writing, especially in the second track of the same name. Describing it as a metaphor, Madonna said that [...] "in Hollywood you can lose your memory and your vision of the future. You can lose everything because you can lose yourself." [...] The beginning of the album cleared away what was not important for her, so Madonna could concentrate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that did matter. So, {{in contrast to the}} first three tracks, the later songs on American Life also deal with issues close to the singer's heart, like talking about her relationship with her parents on the track [...] "Mother and Father". When Madonna was five, her mother died of breast cancer and the track was [...] "a way of letting go of the sadness and moving on." [...] According to Lucy O'Brien, author of , another concept of American Life was about [...] "nothingness". This was evident in the titles of the songs like [...] "Nobody Knows Me", usage of [...] "no" [...] in [...] "Love Profusion", as well as [...] "Nothing Fails". Usage of the negative tone led Madonna to be sarcastic on people's assumptions about her and emphasize about her knowledge of romantic love. But [...] "Nothing Fails", along with tracks [...] "Intervention" [...] and [...] "X-Static Process," [...] became the centerpiece of the album as a triptych of love songs for Ritchie. Beginning as a humble track that musician-producer Guy Sigsworth wrote for his wife, [...] "Nothing Fails" [...] also has lyrics by singer Jem Archer, who was asked to collaborate with Sigsworth and Madonna during the first collaborative sessions of American Life. The track is followed by the folk-inspired [...] "Intervention" [...] and [...] "X-Static Process," [...] both being reflective and emotional. Her reflective mood continued with the last track [...] "Easy Ride," [...] which was inspired by the imagery of a full-circle and symbolized life for the singer.|$|E

2500|$|Cunningham began {{teaching}} at the City College of New York (19621965) and the Brooklyn Museum Art School (19621980). His Sunday high school scholarship class at BMAS {{came to be known}} for its nontraditional methods of figurative painting, observing directly from nature using a plumb-line and finder, and putting down on the flat surface of the canvas abstracted color-value notes. Students included Peter Colquhoun, Israel Hershberg, Richard Leto and Ephraim Rubenstein. [...] "Francis Cunningham taught us all how to see," [...] said Rubenstein. [...] "He continually implored us to look at nature freshly 'like a new-born babe,' or like 'a man from Mars,' who had never laid eyes before <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> of this earth". Cunningham taught at the Art Students League of New York (19801983). In 1980, he co-founded The New Brooklyn School of Life, Painting, Drawing & Sculpture, Inc., with the sculptor, Barney Hodes. Together they also co-founded with Stuart Pivar The New York Academy of Art (19831985), which continues to operate in 2013.|$|E

[...] Daly's resolution was covered extensively by the local media and elevated the issues of treatment of protests {{in relation to the}} Olympics being held in China, the 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay and the torch ceremonies being held in San Francisco, the only North American stop. The torch relay {{will be the first time}} in Olympics history that protests will accompany the torch as it passes through a U.S. city. [...] Daly stated, [...] "he magnitude of attention paid to the Olympic Games and the torch relay makes the event the appropriate platform to discuss human rights. If someone can look you in the face and tell you the Olympics are limited to the individual competitions that take place, well, that's a good poker player." [...] Daly also criticized the rare decision to set up designated [...] "free-speech zones" [...] stating, [...] "I don't see why we should break from our pattern of how we handle mass protests or demonstrations for China." [...] San Francisco mayor, Gavin Newsom, said he has [...] "very serious concerns" [...] about the situation in Tibet but added San Francisco is [...] "privileged" [...] to be the torch's only stop in North America and that the event should rise above political concerns and that the Games should be a time [...] "to focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that unite us and not divide us." [...] In a later committee meeting supervisors Carmen Chu and Sean Elsbernd amended the resolution to welcome the Global Human Rights Torch Relay on April 5 and the Tibetan Freedom Torch on April 8 and commend [...] "their efforts to raise awareness regarding human rights violations in China and urging the San Francisco City Representatives ... to welcome the Torch in the explicit spirit of Olympism, consistent with the United Nations Charter ... and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights." ...|$|E
