5|$|Anteaters, aardvarks, pangolins, {{echidnas}} and numbats {{have special}} adaptations for {{living on a}} diet <b>of</b> <b>ants.</b> These adaptations include long, sticky tongues to capture ants and strong claws to break into ant nests. Brown bears (Ursus arctos) {{have been found to}} feed on ants. About 12%, 16%, and 4% of their faecal volume in spring, summer, and autumn, respectively, is composed <b>of</b> <b>ants.</b>|$|E
5|$|Predators such {{as other}} ants and the thorny devil lizard (Moloch horridus) {{predominantly}} feed on Ochetellus workers; the number <b>of</b> <b>ants</b> that a thorny devil can consume per minute is around 24 to 45.

5|$|Not {{all forms}} of {{policing}} require {{the presence of a}} queen; it also occurs in a few species <b>of</b> <b>ants</b> which establish a dominance hierarchy of reproductive female workers, where top-ranking individuals reproduce.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{discovery}} of the first Sphecomyrma fossils, there were no fossil records of any ants from Cretaceous amber and the oldest social insects at the time extended back to the Eocene epoch; the earliest known ant at the time was described from a forewing found in the Claiborne Formation in Tennessee. The great diversity of ant fossils found in the Baltic amber and Florissant shales of the Oligocene and in the Sicilian amber of the Miocene have prompted entomologists to search for ants of Cretaceous age that may link ants and non-social wasps together. Such a link may shed light on the early origins <b>of</b> <b>ants,</b> but no fossils of any social insect existed before S. freyi was discovered, thus the early evolution <b>of</b> <b>ants</b> remained a mystery. Only a single hymenopterous Upper Cretaceous fossil {{has been the subject of}} possible significance to the evolution of aculeate wasps and ants. A single forewing was discovered in Siberia and described in 1957 as Cretavus sibiricus, with the author noting that the wing ventation closely resembles those of bethylid or scoliid wasps, of which these families of wasps have close connections with the origin <b>of</b> <b>ants.</b> However, there were several problems: as the fossil was only a single wing, scientists could not explain or answer whether or not the insect had key diagnostic body traits that would even place it within the subclade Aculeata.|$|E
5|$|E. O. Wilson is an American biologist, specialising in {{the study}} <b>of</b> <b>ants,</b> social insects on which he is the world's leading expert. He is known also for his {{pioneering}} work on island biogeography, which relates species richness to island size, an important consideration in nature conservation. Wilson however favours group selection over the Neo-Darwinian kin selection as an explanation of co-operation in social animals.|$|E

5|$|Like all ants, {{they can}} also make use of visual {{landmarks}} when available as well as olfactory and tactile cues to navigate. Some species of ant are {{able to use the}} Earth's magnetic field for navigation. The compound eyes <b>of</b> <b>ants</b> have specialised cells that detect polarised light from the Sun, which is used to determine direction.|$|E
5|$|Not all ants {{have the}} same kind of societies. The Australian bulldog ants are among the biggest and most basal <b>of</b> <b>ants.</b> Like {{virtually}} all ants, they are eusocial, but their social behaviour is poorly developed compared to other species. Each individual hunts alone, using her large eyes instead of chemical senses to find prey.|$|E
5|$|Termites, {{although}} {{sometimes called}} 'white ants', are not ants. They {{belong to the}} sub-order Isoptera within the order Blattodea. Termites are {{more closely related to}} cockroaches and mantids. Termites are eusocial, but differ greatly in the genetics of reproduction. The similarity of their social structure to that <b>of</b> <b>ants</b> is attributed to convergent evolution. Velvet ants look like large ants, but are wingless female wasps.|$|E

5|$|The prey {{does not}} have to be {{attracted}} towards the predator for the predator to benefit: it is sufficient for the predator simply not to be identified as a threat. Wicklerian-Eisnerian mimics may resemble a mutualistic ally, or a species of little significance to the prey such as a commensal. For example, the spider Arachnocoris berytoides resembles Faiditus caudatus, a spider commensal <b>of</b> <b>ants.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{conflict}} between the sexes of a species is seen in some species <b>of</b> <b>ants</b> with these reproducers apparently competing to produce offspring that are as closely related to them as possible. The most extreme form involves the production of clonal offspring. An extreme of sexual conflict is seen in Wasmannia auropunctata, where the queens produce diploid daughters by thelytokous parthenogenesis and males produce clones by a process whereby a diploid egg loses its maternal contribution to produce haploid males who are clones of the father.|$|E
5|$|A number <b>of</b> <b>ants</b> {{have been}} named after Clark. The holotype of Polyrhachis clarki was {{originally}} collected by Clark, {{but it was not}} described until 2013. There, the author of the article named the ant after him. Leptogenys clarki is another ant named after Clark for his contributions towards Australian ants, being described by American entomologist William Morton Wheeler in 1933. Ants he collected that bear his name include Dolichoderus clarki, Plagiolepis clarki and Stigmacros clarki.|$|E

5|$|Ant Island is {{a colony}} <b>of</b> <b>ants</b> {{led by the}} Queen and her daughter, Princess Atta. Every season, {{they are forced to}} give food to a gang of marauding {{grasshoppers}} led by Hopper. One day, when Flik, an individualist and would-be inventor, inadvertently knocks the offering into a stream with his latest invention, a grain harvesting device, Hopper demands twice as much food as compensation. When Flik suggests in earnest that they seek help from other stronger bugs, the other ants see it as an opportunity to remove him and send him off.|$|E
5|$|Ant {{societies}} have division of labour, communication between individuals, {{and an ability}} to solve complex problems. These parallels with human {{societies have}} long been an inspiration and subject of study. Many human cultures make use <b>of</b> <b>ants</b> in cuisine, medication, and rituals. Some species are valued in their role as biological pest control agents. Their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans, however, as they can damage crops and invade buildings. Some species, such as the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), are regarded as invasive species, establishing themselves in areas where they have been introduced accidentally.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{identify}} kin and nestmates {{through their}} scent, {{which comes from}} hydrocarbon-laced secretions that coat their exoskeletons. If an ant is separated from its original colony, it will eventually lose the colony scent. Any ant that enters a colony without a matching scent will be attacked. Also, the reason why two separate colonies <b>of</b> <b>ants</b> will attack each other {{even if they are}} of the same species is because the genes responsible for pheromone production are different between them. The Argentine ant, however, does not have this characteristic, due to lack of genetic diversity, and has become a global pest because of it.|$|E
