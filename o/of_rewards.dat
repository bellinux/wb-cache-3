5|$|Sigmund Freud, {{the founder}} of psychoanalytic theory, {{discussed}} the ego's role in balancing the immediate pleasure-driven desires of the id with the morality-driven choices of the superego. Funder and Block expanded psychoanalytic research on the topic, and found that impulsivity, {{or a lack of}} ego-control, has a stronger effect on one's ability to delay rewards if a reward is more desirable. Finally, environmental and social factors play a role; for example, delay is affected by the self-imposed or external nature of a reward contingency, by the degree of task engagement required during the delay, by early mother-child relationship characteristics, by a person's previous experiences with unreliable promises <b>of</b> <b>rewards</b> (e.g., in poverty), and by contemporary sociocultural expectations and paradigms. Research on animals comprises another body of literature describing delayed gratification characteristics that are not as easily tested in human samples, such as ecological factors affecting the skill.|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe time <b>of</b> <b>reward</b> and the {{temporal}} structure <b>of</b> <b>reward</b> occurrence fundamentally influence behavioral reinforcement and decision processes [1 – 11]. However, despite knowledge about timing in sensory and motor systems [12 – 17], we {{know little about}} temporal mechanisms <b>of</b> neuronal <b>reward</b> processing. In this experiment, visual stimuli predicted different instantaneous probabilities <b>of</b> <b>reward</b> occurrence that resulted in specific temporal reward structures. Licking behavior demonstrated that the animals had developed expectations for the time <b>of</b> <b>reward</b> that reflected the instantaneous reward probabilities. Neurons in the amygdala, a major component <b>of</b> the brain's <b>reward</b> system [18 – 29], showed two types <b>of</b> <b>reward</b> signal, both <b>of</b> which were sensitive to the expected time <b>of</b> <b>reward.</b> First, the time courses of anticipatory activity preceding reward delivery followed the specific instantaneous reward probabilities and thus paralleled {{the temporal}} reward structures. Second, the magnitudes <b>of</b> responses following <b>reward</b> delivery covaried with the instantaneous reward probabilities, reflecting the influence <b>of</b> temporal <b>reward</b> structures at the moment <b>of</b> <b>reward</b> delivery. In being sensitive to temporal reward structure, the <b>reward</b> signals <b>of</b> amygdala neurons reflected the temporally specific expectations <b>of</b> <b>reward.</b> The data demonstrate an active involvement of amygdala neurons in timing processes that are crucial for reward function...|$|R

40|$|Because most {{rewarding}} events are probabilistic and changing, the extinction <b>of</b> probabilistic <b>rewards</b> {{is important for}} survival. It has been proposed that the extinction <b>of</b> probabilistic <b>rewards</b> depends on arousal and the amount <b>of</b> learning <b>of</b> <b>reward</b> values. Midbrain dopamine neurons were suggested {{to play a role}} in both arousal and learning reward values. Despite extensive research on modeling dopaminergic activity in reward learning (e. g. temporal difference models), few studies have been done on modeling its role in arousal. Although temporal difference models capture key characteristics of dopaminergic activity during the extinction <b>of</b> deterministic <b>rewards,</b> they have been less successful at simulating the extinction <b>of</b> probabilistic <b>rewards.</b> By adding an arousal signal to a temporal difference model, we were able to simulate the extinction <b>of</b> probabilistic <b>rewards</b> and its dependence on the amount of learning. Our simulations propose that arousal allows the probability <b>of</b> <b>reward</b> to have lasting effects on the updating <b>of</b> <b>reward</b> value, which slows the extinction <b>of</b> low probability <b>rewards.</b> Using this model, we predicted that, by signaling the prediction error, dopamine determines the learned reward value that has to be extinguished during extinction and participates in regulating the size of the arousal signal that controls the learning rate. These predictions were supported by pharmacological experiments in rats...|$|R

25|$|Unsupervised {{learning}} {{is the ability}} to find patterns in a stream of input. Supervised learning includes both classification and numerical regression. Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in, after seeing a number of examples of things from several categories. Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change. In reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent uses this sequence <b>of</b> <b>rewards</b> and punishments to form a strategy for operating in its problem space. These three types of learning can be analyzed in terms of decision theory, using concepts like utility. The mathematical analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory.|$|E

Barbara Ann Marinak, 2004 Directed by: 	Linda Gambrell, Professor Clemson University This study {{investigated}} the effects <b>of</b> <b>reward</b> proximity and choice <b>of</b> <b>reward</b> on the reading motivation of third-grade average readers. Seventy-five students participated in the study. Participants {{were randomly assigned to}} one of four treatment groups (book/choice, book/no choice, token/choice, token/no choice) and a control group that received no reward. All students who participated in this study were invited to read from one of six trade books that were being considered for purchase in the school library. After making his or her recommendation about the book, each student received a reward or no reward based on treatment condition. The student was then invited to remain in the experimental room and was observed during a 10 -minute free-choice period. During the free-choice period, the child could choose to continue reading from the library book array or choose a jigsaw puzzle or a math game. The effect of the independent variables, proximity <b>of</b> <b>reward</b> and choice <b>of</b> <b>reward,</b> on intrinsic motivation to read was measured with three indicators of task persistence and a question of self-reported enjoyment. The indices of persistence were first activity selected, time spent reading, and number of words read. The self-report measure was the response to a question regarding the "most fun activity" in the experimental room. The present study indicated that the students given a book (proximal reward) and the students who received no reward were more motivated to engage in subsequent reading than the students that received a token (less proximal reward). The findings from the present study indicate that the proximity <b>of</b> the <b>reward</b> to the desired behavior is a particularly salient factor in enhancing motivation. In addition, the findings from the study suggest that less proximal rewards, such as tokens, undermine intrinsic motivation. Finally, although choice has been demonstrated to be a powerful aspect of intrinsic motivation (Deci, 2000; Rigby et al., 1992; Gottfried, 1985; Guthrie & Wigfield, 1997), the choice <b>of</b> <b>reward</b> was not found to be a salient factor in this study. The type <b>of</b> <b>reward</b> (book or token) was a significant factor, while choice <b>of</b> <b>reward</b> had no apparent effect on the intrinsic motivation to read...|$|R
