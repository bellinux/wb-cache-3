5|$|Nagpal was {{suspended}} on 28 July 2013, {{a day after}} she allegedly demolished a wall of an under-construction mosque in Kadalpur village, in the Rabupura area of Greater Noida. The construction of the mosque had not been cleared by the state government. Whether Nagpal was actually involved in the demolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> and whether she was justified in her actions even if she was, are disputed. Her supporters {{and most of the}} media sources claim that Nagpal did not order the demolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> and was not even present at the site when the incident happened. According to them, she was targeted due to her campaign against illegal sand-mining, and allegations of Nagpal's involvement in the demolition are false. However, there are other sources which quote residents of Kadalpur village claiming that Nagpal personally supervised the demolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E

25|$|At its simplest, a {{defensive}} wall {{consists of a}} wall enclosure and its gates. For the most part, <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> were accessible, with <b>the</b> outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> having tall parapets with embrasures or merlons. North <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Alps, this passageway at <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> occasionally had a roof.|$|R

5|$|Battlements {{were most}} often found surmounting curtain {{walls and the}} tops of gatehouses, and {{comprised}} several elements: crenellations, hoardings, machicolations, and loopholes. Crenellation is the collective name for alternating crenels and merlons: gaps and solid blocks {{on top of a}} wall. Hoardings were wooden constructs that projected beyond the wall, allowing defenders to shoot at, or drop objects on, attackers at the base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> without having to lean perilously over the crenellations, thereby exposing themselves to retaliatory fire. Machicolations were stone projections on top of a wall with openings that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at the base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> in a similar fashion to hoardings.|$|E

5|$|Demolitions began {{soon after}} the {{withdrawal}} of the Jacobite threat in 1746. The bastions of the Telfer Wall along Lauriston Place were demolished in 1762, as they were obstructing traffic. The Netherbow survived until 1764, when it too was removed as an obstruction. The West Port and the Potterow Port were removed in the 1780s. By now, the New Town was under construction, and although smuggling of goods through the city walls was still being punished, complaints about the zealousness of the guards were widely circulated. The Old College of the University of Edinburgh (constructed from 1789), and then the Royal Museum of Scotland (constructed from 1861), were built over sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> around the Potterow Port. Forrest Road was laid out in the 1840s, resulting in the loss of another section of the Telfer Wall. During construction works around the Advocates' Library and Parliament House in 1832 and 1845, fragments of walling were uncovered, which were attributed to the King's Wall. Two sections of the increasingly neglected town wall collapsed in the mid-1850s. In 1854, a large portion of wall (20 feet high and 3–4 feet thick), and the embankment against which it was built fell into Leith Wynd between the High Street and Calton Road. A week later the Dean of Guild ordered the removal of a 150 feet stretch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> from that location. In 1856, a lightning strike appears to have been the cause of the collapse of a 40 to 50 feet stretch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> enclosing Greyfriars Kirkyard.|$|E
5|$|Four {{sections}} of the Flodden Wall survive: {{to the north and}} south of the Grassmarket; in Greyfriars Kirkyard; and along Drummond Street and the Pleasance. North of the Grassmarket the wall runs alongside Granny's Green Steps and has been incorporated into later buildings, including the former Greyfriars Mission Kirk. A line of granite paving across the Grassmarket marks the line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> where it was uncovered during construction work in 2008. In the Vennel the last remaining bastion of the town walls survives. The Flodden Tower, as it is sometimes known, comprises two remaining walls with a total length of , pierced by crosslet gunloops and a 19th-century window. Sections of the Flodden Wall can be seen within Greyfriars Kirkyard, adorned with 16th and 17th century tombstones. At the junction of Forrest Road and Bristo Street a line of cobbles and a narrow gap in the later buildings mark the line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> The longest section is in Drummond Street and the Pleasance, where it originally enclosed the Blackfriars Monastery. At the corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> a blocked archway is probably the entrance to a demolished bastion. The site of the Netherbow is marked with an outline of brass blocks at the junction of the Royal Mile and St Mary's Street.|$|E
50|$|Around 1590, during <b>the</b> French Wars <b>of</b> Religion, Caunes was pillaged by Huguenots {{and held}} under siege until {{eventually}} taken by Henri, Duc de Joyeuse. He ordered <b>the</b> demolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Abbey enclosure {{as well as}} <b>the</b> outer ring <b>of</b> town walls; only remnants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> exist today. A map showing <b>the</b> presumed outline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> {{is available from the}} Tourist Office.|$|R
50|$|The Dàjìng Gé Pavillon (上海古城墙和大境阁) is {{a museum}} and ancient temple <b>of</b> Shanghai, {{incorporating}} <b>the</b> last remaining portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old City <b>of</b> Shanghai. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> were dismantled in 1912, and today only this portion remains.|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Second World War, a {{military}} post was erected {{on the site}} and portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> were used to build a small building to garrison troops. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> this building remains intact.|$|R
5|$|In 1709, {{the main}} fort at Viborg {{consisted}} of five frontal bastions named Holtz, Neuport, Klein-Platform, Wasserport and Eleonora, connected by the Viborg town wall, {{in the eastern}} section of the town. The {{western part of the}} town, connected to the main section, had three bastions named Valport, Pansarlax, and Europa. To the west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> between Pansarlax and Europa, there was a ravelin and two caponiers, and to the west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> between Evrop and Eleonora was another ravelin. Both ravelins were, apparently, earthen, but inside the main eastern fort, all structures were stone. Most of the structures {{in the western part of}} the fort were wooden, with the exception of the stone guard tower, named the Petersburg tower. Separate from these fortifications, on the small central island east of the town (now the Zamochnyy Island), was Schloss (Castle) Viborg, which stands to this day. The fort had 151 guns at its defense.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Shlomo Goren {{wrote that}} the {{tradition}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> as a Jewish prayer site was only 300 years old, the Jews being compelled to pray there after being forbidden to assemble on the mount itself.|$|E
5|$|Many {{contemporary}} Orthodox scholars {{rule that}} the area in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> has {{the status of a}} synagogue and must be treated with due respect. This is the view upheld by the authority in charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> As such, men and married women are expected to cover their heads upon approaching the Wall, and to dress appropriately. When departing, the custom is to walk backwards away from the Wall. On Saturdays, it is forbidden to enter the area with electronic devices, including cameras, which infringe on the sanctity of the Sabbath.|$|E
50|$|This {{room was}} created along with Room III. <b>The</b> upper part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> were {{decorated}} with friezes in tempera on canvas by Perino del Vaga. <b>The</b> other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> that were originally painted with paneling are now missing.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to walk upon <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> themselves for roughly half their circumference. Whilst some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> will never be navigable in this way because of their integration into other structures, {{there is a large}} stretch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> that have yet to be made safe for pedestrians.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> {{is around}} 4.2 m and <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> varies between 8 and 12 m. <b>The</b> <b>walls</b> consist <b>of</b> {{internal}} and external stone facing with a core of earth mixes with gravel, pebbles and worked Roman stone recycled from demolished buildings, cemented with water.|$|R

500|$|As {{a result}} of their mixed history, <b>the</b> remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> are owned by various {{different}} organisations and subject to different legal protection. Some parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> are protected as Grade II listed buildings and scheduled monuments, although most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> lack this legal recognition. <b>The</b> multiple ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city <b>walls</b> contributed to what English Heritage considered an [...] "uncoordinated" [...] approach to their conservation. In response, a conservation plan has been created by Worcester City Council, proposing that <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> despite their mixed ownership, should be managed as a single historic monument, and advising that some sections be repaired urgently; as of 2010 this plan was awaiting approval by English Heritage.|$|R
