5|$|Howard Browne, who {{had been}} on a leave of absence from Ziff-Davis to write fiction, took over as editor and began by {{throwing}} away 300,000 words <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> that Palmer had acquired before he left. Browne had ambitions of moving Amazing upmarket, and his argument was strengthened by Street & Smith, one of the longest established and most respected publishers, who shut down all of their pulp magazines in the summer of 1949. The pulps were dying, {{largely as a result of}} the success of pocketbooks, and Street & Smith decided to concentrate on their slick magazines. Some pulps struggled on for a few more years, but Browne was able to persuade Ziff and Davis that the future was in the slicks, and they raised his fiction budget from one cent to a ceiling of five cents per word. Browne managed to get promises of new stories from many well-known authors, including Isaac Asimov and Theodore Sturgeon. He produced a dummy issue in April 1950, and planned to launch the new incarnation of Amazing in April 1951, the 25th anniversary of the first issue. However, the economic impact of the Korean War, which broke out in June 1950, led to budget cuts. The plans were cancelled, and Ziff-Davis never revived the idea.|$|E

40|$|What is {{the role}} <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> in UK manufacturing? We present and {{estimate}} a model <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> that considers separately finished goods and input (i. e. the sum of raw materials and work-in-process) inventories. Our results suggest that both types <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> are used for production level and production cost smoothing. We identify a small but significant negative relationship between inventories and the real interest rate, thus providing support {{for one of the}} textbook channels of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Variance decompositions indicate that technology shocks are the dominant driving factor behind cyclical changes in inventories...|$|R
25|$|The {{benefit of}} these {{formulas}} {{is that the}} first absorbs all overheads of production and raw material costs into a value <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> for reporting.

25|$|Time - The time lags {{present in}} the supply chain, from {{supplier}} to user at every stage, requires that you maintain certain amounts <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> to use in this lead time.

40|$|It {{is usually}} {{accepted}} in economic theory {{that one of}} the main reasons for keeping inventories is to balance supply and demand. However, the experiences of the recent years in Poland indicate that inventories play this role only in a limited way. The present paper is devoted to an interesting problem concerning the possibilities of using the changes <b>of</b> stocks <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> as disequilibrium indicator for particular commodity markets. The analysis covers the changes <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> in a socialized trade; the study, however, is of a more general character and the conclusions also apply to the <b>inventories</b> <b>of</b> finished products in enterprises, and to materials and semi-manufactured goods in the production process.

25|$|Since {{the mid-1990s}} {{increasingly}} sophisticated mathematical {{models have been}} developed such as the dynamic programming formulation pioneered by Talluri and Van Ryzin {{which has led to}} more accurate estimates of bid prices.

25|$|In words, {{you want}} to protect 1 units <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> for the higher valued segment where 1 {{is equal to the}} inverse {{probability}} of demand of the revenue ratio of the lower valued segment to the higher valued segment. This equation defines the EMSRa algorithm which handles the two segment case. EMSRb is smarter and handles multiple segments by comparing the revenue of the lower segment to a demand weighted average of the revenues of the higher segments. Neither of these heuristics produces the exact right answer and increasingly implementations make use of Monte Carlo simulation to find optimal protection levels.|$|E

In 2011 the county lost $599,690 in revenue provided by the federal government, and rather than adjust the annual budget or restore the merchants capital tax, the board approved a 16% personal property tax increase to raise an additional $666,141 of revenue for the county.|$|E
40|$|The paper aims to {{make the}} first step to the {{empirical}} investigation of managers' perception of the role <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> in today's business. In a previous paper [Chikn, A., 2004. The new role <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> in business: real world changes and research consequences. Paper presented at the 13 th International Symposium on <b>Inventories.</b> International Journal <b>of</b> Production Economics, to appear] I have stated {{that there has been a}} gradual paradigm shift in inventory management in the last decades, due to the extensive changes in the economic and business environment. The main point is that the new paradigm assumes a far more complex role <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> than in the traditional approach, leading to a strategic role <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> in a triple role: as contributors to value creation, as means of flexibility and means of control. The new paradigm leads to new needs for research orientation and methodology. The train of thoughts in the earlier conceptual paper is to be checked in practical business environment. This paper reports on a survey of 51 Hungarian companies and explores their view on inventories. The results obtained are reassuring and promising but further research is necessary. <b>Inventory</b> management Role <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> Paradigm change Managerial survey...|$|R

25|$|Regarding the {{traditional}} pull approach to inventory control, {{a number of}} techniques have been developed {{based on the work}} of Ford W. Harris (1913), which came to be known as the economic order quantity (EOQ) model. This model marks the beginning <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> theory, which includes the Wagner-Within procedure, the newsvendor model, base stock model and the Fixed Time Period model. These models usually involve the calculation of cycle stocks and buffer stocks, the latter usually modeled as a function of demand variability. The economic production quantity (EPQ) differs from the EOQ model only in that it assumes a constant fill rate for the part being produced, instead of the instantaneous refilling of the EOQ model.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} costing/valuation <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> can be complex. Whereas in {{the past}} most enterprises ran simple, one-process factories, such enterprises are quite probably in the minority in the 21st century. Where 'one process' factories exist, there is a market for the goods created, which establishes an independent market value for the good. Today, with multistage-process companies, there is much inventory that would once have been finished goods which is now held as 'work in process' (WIP). This needs to be valued in the accounts, but the valuation is a management decision {{since there is no}} market for the partially finished product. This somewhat arbitrary 'valuation' of WIP combined with the allocation of overheads to it has led to some unintended and undesirable results.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis I study the {{contribution}} to firm value <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> management from a risk management perspective. I find {{a significant contribution}} <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> {{to the value of}} risk management especially through the operating flexibility channel. In contrast, I do not find evidence supporting the view <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> a reserve <b>of</b> liquidity. <b>Inventories</b> substitute, albeit not perfectly, derivatives or cash holdings. The substitution between hedging with derivatives and inventory is moderated by the correlation between cash flow and the underlying asset in the derivative contract. Hedge ratios increase with the effectiveness of derivatives. The decision to hedge with cash holdings or inventories is strongly influenced by the degree of complementarity between production factors and by cash flow volatility. In addition, I provide a risk management based explanation of the secular substitution between inventories and cash holdings documented, among others, in Bates et al. (2009), Journal of Finance. In a sample of U. S. firms between 1980 and 2006, I empirically confirm the negative relation between inventories and cash and provide evidence on the poor performance of investment cash flow sensitivities as a measure of financial constraints also in the case <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> investment. This result can be explained by firms' scarce reliance on inventories as a reserve of liquidity. Finally, as an extension of my study, I contrast with empirical data the theoretical predictions of a model on the integrated management <b>of</b> <b>inventories,</b> trade credit and cash holdings...|$|R
