5|$|The {{concept of}} a {{derivative}} can be extended to many other settings. The common thread is that the derivative of a function at a point serves as a linear approximation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>function</b> at that point.|$|E
5|$|Cell theory {{states that}} the cell is the {{fundamental}} unit of life, that all living things are composed {{of one or more}} cells, and that all cells arise from other cells through cell division. In multicellular organisms, every cell in the organism's body derives ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg. The cell is also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes. In addition, the phenomenon of energy flow occurs in cells in processes that are part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>function</b> known as metabolism. Finally, cells contain hereditary information (DNA), which is passed from cell to cell during cell division. Research into the origin of life, abiogenesis, amounts to an attempt to discover the origin of the first cells.|$|E
5|$|Finally, in {{practice}} {{one wants to}} approximate the function with {{a finite number of}} terms, say with a Taylor polynomial or a partial sum of the trigonometric series, respectively. In the case of the Taylor series the error is very small in a neighbourhood of the point where it is computed, while it may be very large at a distant point. In the case of the Fourier series the error is distributed along the domain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E

5|$|The nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>function</b> {{delegated}} by {{a public}} authority is crucial in determining whether such delegation offends the law. Where functions are considered administrative, delegation may not be wrongful. In R. v. Race Relations Board, ex parte Selvarajan (1975), it was accepted that the Board could establish a committee in order to investigate and conduct preliminary inquiries, {{and that it was}} not practical for the whole body to be engaged in such a task. On the other hand, it is an established principle that no tribunal can delegate judicial or quasi-judicial functions such as disciplinary powers.|$|E
5|$|Like {{those of}} most other non-avian theropods, Acrocanthosaurus forelimbs did not {{make contact with the}} ground and were not used for locomotion; instead they served a predatory function. The {{discovery}} of a complete forelimb (NCSM 14345) allowed the first analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>function</b> and range of motion of the forelimb in Acrocanthosaurus. The study examined the bone surfaces which would have articulated with other bones to determine how far the joints could move without dislocating. In many of the joints, the bones did not fit together exactly, indicating the presence of a considerable amount of cartilage in the joints, as is seen in many living archosaurs. Among other findings, the study suggested that, in a resting position, the forelimbs would have hung from the shoulders with the humerus angled backwards slightly, the elbow bent, and the claws facing medially (inwards).|$|E
5|$|Mutation bias {{effects are}} {{superimposed}} on other processes. If selection would favor either {{one out of}} two mutations, {{but there is no}} extra advantage to having both, then the mutation that occurs the most frequently is the one that is most likely to become fixed in a population. Mutations leading to the loss of function of a gene are much more common than mutations that produce a new, fully functional gene. Most loss of function mutations are selected against. But when selection is weak, mutation bias towards loss of function can affect evolution. For example, pigments are no longer useful when animals live in the darkness of caves, and tend to be lost. This kind of loss of function can occur because of mutation bias, and/or because the function had a cost, and once the benefit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>function</b> disappeared, natural selection leads to the loss. Loss of sporulation ability in Bacillus subtilis during laboratory evolution appears to have been caused by mutation bias, rather than natural selection against the cost of maintaining sporulation ability. When there is no selection for loss of function, the speed at which loss evolves depends more on the mutation rate than it does on the effective population size, indicating that it is driven more by mutation bias than by genetic drift. In parasitic organisms, mutation bias leads to selection pressures as seen in Ehrlichia. Mutations are biased towards antigenic variants in outer-membrane proteins.|$|E

50|$|Some compilers (for example, GCC) provide {{built-in}} versions <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>functions</b> in <b>the</b> C standard library; that is, <b>the</b> implementations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>functions</b> {{are written}} into the compiled object file, and the program calls the built-in versions instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>functions</b> in <b>the</b> C library shared object file. This reduces function call overhead, especially if function calls are replaced with inline variants, and allows other forms <b>of</b> optimization (as <b>the</b> compiler knows <b>the</b> control-flow characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> built-in variants), but may cause confusion when debugging (for example, the built-in versions cannot be replaced with instrumented variants).|$|R

25|$|In {{the context}} of complex dynamics, a topic of mathematics, the Julia set and the Fatou set are two {{complementary}} sets (Julia 'laces' and Fatou 'dusts') defined from a function.
