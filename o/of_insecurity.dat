5|$|The {{subject of}} the {{emergence}} of castles is a complex matter which has led to considerable debate. Discussions have typically attributed the rise of the castle to a reaction to attacks by Magyars, Muslims, and Vikings and a need for private defence. The breakdown of the Carolingian Empire led to the privatisation of government, and local lords assumed responsibility for the economy and justice. However, while castles proliferated in the 9th and 10th centuries the link between periods <b>of</b> <b>insecurity</b> and building fortifications is not always straightforward. Some high concentrations of castles occur in secure places, while some border regions had relatively few castles.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the individual military punishments, the army took further internal measures to {{lower the risk of}} another insurrection. According to Maurice Rives, 10,000 Vietnamese troops were given transfers to different zones. This meant that more than 80% of Tonkin's approximately 12,000 Tirailleurs Tonkinois were moved, a transfer of enormous proportions, indicating the extent <b>of</b> <b>insecurity</b> among French commanders towards Vietnamese troops, {{and the extent to which}} they were willing to go to make future Yen Bays impossible. One possible rationale for this measure was to break up any undiscovered VNQDĐ cells and to sever personal ties, within units and between soldiers and civilians in their local district. The mass transfer of soldiers also had the effect of creating a state of constant mobilisation, denying troops the time and opportunity for anti-colonial organisation.|$|E
5|$|The {{referendum}} was {{the last}} phase in the power struggle between Bảo Đại and his prime minister. Bảo Đại disliked Diệm and had frequently attempted to undermine him, having appointed him only {{because he was a}} conduit to American aid. At the time, the country was going through a period <b>of</b> <b>insecurity,</b> as Vietnam had been temporarily partitioned {{as a result of the}} 1954 Geneva Accords that ended the First Indochina War. The State of Vietnam controlled the southern half of the country, pending national elections that were intended to reunify the country under a common government. Still, the Vietnamese National Army was not in full control of southern Vietnam; the Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo religious sects ran their own administrations in the countryside supported by private armies, while the Bình Xuyên organised crime syndicate controlled the streets of Saigon. Despite interference from these groups, Bảo Đại, and even French officials, Diệm managed to subdue the private armies and consolidate government control over the country by mid-1955.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Within the {{extensive}} food insecurity literature, little {{work has been}} done regarding (a) the depth and severity <b>of</b> food <b>insecurity</b> and (b) the food <b>insecurity</b> <b>of</b> American Indians. This paper addresses both these topics with data from the 2001 to 2004 Core Food Security Module of the Current Population Survey. To measure food insecurity, three axiomatically derived measures <b>of</b> food <b>insecurity</b> are used. As expected, given the worse economic conditions facing American Indians, their food insecurity levels are generally higher than non-American Indians. However, the magnitude and significance of these differences differ depending on the choice <b>of</b> food <b>insecurity</b> measure...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{interactions}} between the risk <b>of</b> food <b>insecurity</b> and the decision to health insure in the Palestinian Territories. The risk of adverse health conditions is insurable; the risk <b>of</b> food <b>insecurity</b> is a background risk and no market insurance exists. The vulnerability to food insecurity influences the individual utility from health insuring. We present a competing risk model to reveal this interdependence. We specify the empirical model as a bivariate probit model and evaluate the impact <b>of</b> food <b>insecurity</b> on the household decision to health insure. We find evidence of significant complementarity between the risk <b>of</b> food <b>insecurity</b> and the propensity to health insure. The predicted conditional probabilities reveal that the propensity to health insure is higher in presence <b>of</b> food <b>insecurity</b> among Palestinian households. This study shows that, in presence of a background risk, there are complementarities among risks that policy should be mindful of. ...|$|R

For example, San Isidro {{has the lowest}} perception <b>of</b> <b>insecurity</b> (21.4%), while Rimac has the highest perception <b>of</b> <b>insecurity</b> (85%), according to a 2012 survey. The five districts with the lowest perception <b>of</b> <b>insecurity</b> are San Isidro, San Borja, Miraflores, La Molina and Jesus Maria. The districts with the highest perception <b>of</b> <b>insecurity</b> are Rimac, San Juan de Miraflores, La Victoria, Comas and Ate.|$|E

40|$|The {{increased}} flexibility on {{the labour}} market {{has given rise}} to feelings <b>of</b> job <b>insecurity</b> in many individuals. The stress literature suggests that the fear of losing one's job could be as detrimental as losing the job itself, and numerous studies indicate that job insecurity may indeed have important consequences for both the individual and the organization. However, the effects <b>of</b> job <b>insecurity</b> are typically greater with regard to short-term rather than long-term consequences. Therefore, the aim {{of this article is to}} investigate if short-term consequences (job satisfaction and organizational commitment) mediate the impact <b>of</b> job <b>insecurity</b> on long-term outcomes (mental health complaints and turnover intention). Survey data from four European countries show that the effect <b>of</b> job <b>insecurity</b> on turnover intention is mediated by organizational commitment and job satisfaction. In contrast, it appears that work attitudes partially mediate the effect <b>of</b> job <b>insecurity</b> on mental health complaints...|$|R
40|$|Along {{with the}} {{increased}} flexibilization of the labour market in Europe, {{there has been a}} change in the permanence and security <b>of</b> employment. Job <b>insecurity</b> is constituted by a subjectively experienced threat of having to give up one's job sooner than one would like. The experience <b>of</b> job <b>insecurity</b> has been linked to decreasing well-being, negative attitudes towards one's job and organization, and reluctance to stay with the organization. The present study investigates what groups experience higher levels <b>of</b> job <b>insecurity</b> than others. Survey data from four European countries (Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden) were used to determine what characterizes individuals who experience high levels <b>of</b> job <b>insecurity.</b> The results show that employees in jobs characterized by manual labour, contingent workers, and to some extent older workers and those with lower levels of education, experience higher levels <b>of</b> job <b>insecurity.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Plug in hybrid {{electric}} vehicles (PHEVs) {{can be a}} strategic source to mitigate risk <b>of</b> supply <b>insecurity</b> in an active distribution network. This study proposes a new methodology to quantify the risk <b>of</b> supply <b>insecurity</b> with weather condition based operation of PHEVs in an active distribution network. The approach divides operating characteristics of PHEVs into charging, discharging and null. Operation of PHEVs with change in weather conditions, intermittent characteristics of distributed generation, sector customer demand characteristics and random outages of components are modelled on Markovchain Monte Carlo simulation. A set of case studies are performed considering distributed operation of PHEVs as oppose to central operation of conventional units. Results suggest that distributed operation of PHEVs can potentially mitigate risk <b>of</b> supply <b>insecurity</b> <b>of</b> moderately stressed networks. Highly stressed networks, which are operated with PHEVs, need supplementary supports from conventional units to mitigate risk <b>of</b> supply <b>insecurity...</b>|$|R

40|$|The authors {{develop an}} {{explicitly}} forward-looking indicator <b>of</b> food <b>insecurity</b> {{that takes into}} account both current dietary inadequacy and vulnerability to dietary inadequacy in the future.

The authors evaluate the performance, relative to their dynamic bemchmark, of three readily available alternative indicators: an agricultural production index, a dietary diversity index, and a coping strategy index. Despite the uneven performance of these indexes relative to the individual components of the dynamic food insecurity indicator developed in the paper, they all demonstrate strong associations with that indicator.
