40|$|There is {{a pile of}} n ∈ Z + matches on the table. Players in turn pick 1, 2 or 3 matches until no matches remain. The {{player who}} at this time has an odd number <b>of</b> <b>matches</b> wins the game. (i) Who wins the game for n = 15 ? When the game starts, both players possess an even number <b>of</b> <b>matches,</b> namely 0. Important to note is that each {{successive}} turn in the game depends on wheter the active player has an odd or even number <b>of</b> <b>matches.</b> In fact, {{it turns out that}} this property, together with the number <b>of</b> remaining <b>matches,</b> completely determines the next step by the active player (that is, how many matches to pick); if a winning strategy for this player exists at all. This allows us to create a table that correlates these two game state properties with the number <b>of</b> <b>matches</b> that should be picked next. See Table 1. This table was created assuming that the total number <b>of</b> <b>matches</b> in the game is odd. The value for l indicates the number <b>of</b> <b>matches</b> left on the table. ”Odd ” and ”Even ” indicate what the active player should do if he possesses an odd or even number <b>of</b> <b>matches</b> respectively. For l ∈{ 1, 2, 3 } we reasoned about the sensible number <b>of</b> <b>matches</b> to pick; dots indicate that we verified that no winning strategy exists in such state. For l ≥ 4, the number <b>of</b> <b>matches</b> to pick was determined by referencing the table columns for l − 1, l − 2 and l − 3. Arrows a, b and c indicate how this is done. For example, arrow a assumes the active player possesses an even number <b>of</b> <b>matches,</b> while l = 7 matche...|$|R
