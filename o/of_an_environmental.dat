5|$|The {{section of}} Highway404 north of Stouffville Road {{was the subject}} of {{considerable}} controversy when work began to clear the route on 15 May 1981 before the completion <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>environmental</b> impact assessment.

5|$|In 1909, Theodore Roosevelt {{created the}} Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge (HINWR), which {{is under the}} {{jurisdiction}} of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Throughout the 1980s, the National Marine Fisheries Service completed various versions <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>Environmental</b> Impact Statement that designated the Northwest Hawaiian Islands as a critical habitat for the Hawaiian monk seal. The designation prohibited lobster fishing in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands and Laysan Island. In 2006, a Presidential Proclamation established the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, which incorporated the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve, the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge, and the Battle of Midway National Memorial, thus creating the largest marine protected area in the world and affording the Hawaiian monk seal further protection.|$|E
5|$|Romm {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} Middletown, New York, the {{youngest}} of three sons of Al Romm (1926–1999), managing editor of the Times Herald-Record newspaper, and Ethel Grodzins Romm, an author, journalist, retired project manager, former CEO <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>environmental</b> technology company and chair of the Lyceum Society of the New York Academy of Sciences. Romm's brother David was the host and producer of Shockwave Radio Theater on KFAI-FM and his brother Daniel is a physician.

5|$|Yorkshire {{police officer}} Ronald Craven (Bob Peck) is {{returning}} {{home with his}} daughter Emma (Joanne Whalley) having picked her up from a meeting <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>environmental</b> organisation at her university campus. On the doorstep of their home Emma is shot dead. The police concentrate their effort {{on the theory that}} her murder was a botched attempt on Craven's life by a criminal he had been responsible for convicting. However, as Craven goes through Emma's belongings, he discovers a geiger counter and a gun. He also learns that Emma's body and her possessions are radioactive. Travelling to London to assist with the inquiry, he is contacted by Pendleton (Charles Kay), a polished official “attached to the Prime Minister's office”, who informs him that Emma was known to them as a terrorist and that it may have been her, not Craven, who was the gunman's target.|$|E
5|$|By 1973, {{construction}} was progressing {{on the western}} quadrant between I-15 in Murray and SR-201 (at the time US-40A/US-50A). Land acquisition was also taking place {{for the rest of}} the southeastern quadrant between 300 East in Murray and 4600 South in Holladay. However, a citizens' group named Cottonwood Inc. halted right-of-way acquirements due to the lack <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>environmental</b> impact statement (EIS). Also controversial was a proposed cloverleaf interchange at 2000 East. By mid-1975, an EIS was released with four main alternatives: a no-build alternative which would leave a gap in the southeast quadrant, building the road along the modern-day path (at about 6400 South), moving the southern portion southwest through Fort Union and Midvale to 7200 South, or extending the eastern portion further south to Sandy and then west along 9000 South. Cottonwood Inc. filed a lawsuit challenging the EIS. Meanwhile, I-215 from SR-201 in the western quadrant to 280 East in Murray opened in November 1976.|$|E
5|$|Caldwell {{is perhaps}} best {{known as one of}} the {{principal}} architects of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the first act of its kind in the world, signed into law on January 1, 1970. In drafting A National Policy on the Environment in 1968 as consultant to Senator Henry Jackson, the head of the powerful Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, Caldwell realized that more was needed than a mere a policy statement: an “action-forcing mechanism” would be necessary to secure federal agency compliance with the Act’s requirements. The origin of the requirement for preparation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>environmental</b> impact statement (EIS) has been attributed to Caldwell, whose testimony at the Senate hearing in April 1969 laid the groundwork for inclusion of provisions requiring an evaluation of the effects of all major federal projects significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. In these “detailed statements,” as they were termed in the Act, all reasonably foreseeable social, economic, and environmental effects of a proposed action and any possible alternatives to it must be identified and assessed before any federal action takes place.|$|E
