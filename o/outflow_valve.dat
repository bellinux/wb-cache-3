For this purpose, pneumatic TAHs (vacuum formed pellethane housing, hard double flap hinged inflow valves, soft trileaflet polyurethane <b>outflow</b> <b>valves)</b> had their blood-exposed surfaces either modified with polymeric phospholipids or unmodified before evaluation in bovine experiments. Orthotopic implantation of the TAHs was performed with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) using tip-to-tip heparin surface coated perfusion equipment and very low systemic heparinization (50 IU/kg bodyweight). After weaning from CPB and stabilizing hemodynamics, circulating heparin was neutralized with protamine (1 : 1). All animals were totally supported for 24 hours before elective sacrifice. No heparin was added at any time during support. Mean activated coagulation time (ACT) was 167 +/- 24 s at baseline before heparinization for CPB, 330 +/- 45 s at the end of CPB, 181 +/- 25 s after 1 hour of support, 180 +/- 31 s after 6 hours, and 185 +/- 28 s after 18 hours. After explantation, the TAHs perfused without anticoagulation were carefully analyzed. Atrial cuff coverage with red clot was 30 +/- 21 % for artificial surfaces modified by biomembrane mimicry versus 100 +/- 0 % for standard control surfaces (p< 0. 01). The number of macroscopic deposits found on the inflow valves was 1. 33 +/- 0. 47 for surfaces modified by biomembrane mimicry versus 3. 83 +/- 1. 86 for standard control surfaces (p< 0. 05).

50|$|A 2003 {{flight of}} a Boeing 737 between Marseilles and London Gatwick {{showed that a}} cabin-wide {{pressurization}} fault can go unrecognized by the flight crew. A problem was first noticed when the crew began to feel some discomfort in their ears. This was shortly followed by the cabin altitude warning horn which indicated that the cabin altitude had exceeded 10,000 feet and this was seen to continue to climb on the cockpit gauge. At the same time, the primary AUTO mode of the pressure control failed, shortly followed by the secondary STBY mode. The crew selected the first manual pressure control mode, but were unable to control the cabin altitude. An emergency descent and subsequent diversion to Lyon was carried out. The failure of the pressurization control system was traced to burnt electrical wiring in the area aft of the aft cargo hold. The wiring loom had been damaged by abrasion with either a p-clip or 'zip' strap that, over time, exposed the conductors, leading to short circuits and subsequent burning of the wires.

50|$|The Learjet 25 {{cabin is}} {{pressurized}} to enable high altitude operations {{without the use}} of supplemental oxygen. The cabin pressure is provided by the conditioned air entering the cabin through the distribution ducts and controlled by modulating the amount of air exhausted from the cabin. During ground operations, a solenoid limits the pressure differential to 0.25 psi in order to ensure normal functioning of the door and emergency exit. The pressure differential at final cruising altitude will be maintained at 8.7 psi difference between pressure altitude and cabin altitude. A rate controller enables the crew to select the rate pressurization of the cabin within preset limits. The normal pressure relief valve will open at 8.9 psi differential pressure and the safety <b>outflow</b> <b>valve</b> will open at 9.2 psi differential pressure which is the maximum allowable differential pressure.Oxygen is contained in a pressurized bottle located in the dorsal fin of the aircraft. The use of oxygen is only required for emergency in case of depressurization of the cabin or contamination of the cabin air. Oxygen is always available for the crew and can be made available to the passengers manually or automatically. The oxygen storage cylinder has a capacity of 38 cubic feet and is stored at 1800 psi. An oxygen rupture disc will relieve oxygen pressure if the oxygen cylinder pressure reaches 2700 to 3000 psi. A green overboard indicator on the outside surface of the dorsal fin will be ruptured or missing to indicate that the rupture disc is not intact.|$|E

40|$|Abstract__ In {{the normal}} heart both {{left and right}} {{ventricle}} have a valve at the atrio-ventricular connection and at the ventriculo-arterial connection. In the left ventricle the inflow valve is the mitral valve and the <b>outflow</b> <b>valve</b> is the aortic valve. In the right ventricle the inflow valve is the tricuspid valve and the <b>outflow</b> <b>valve</b> is the pulmonary valve. These heart valves ascertain that blood only flows in one direction through the heart. The valves are made of strong, thin flaps of tissue, called leaflets. The valves control the blood flow through the heart by opening and closing the leaflets during the contractions of the heart. Heart valve disease occurs when {{one or more of}} the heart valves do not work correctly because of valvular stenosis or valvular regurgitation, or a combination of the two. Valvular stenosis occurs when a heart valve doesn’t fully open due to stiff or fused leaflets or when a valve is congenitally too small. This limits the amount of blood that can flow through the valve. Valvular regurgitation, also known as valvular insufficiency, occurs when a valve does not close properly. This will lead to blood leaking back through the valve when it should be closed. All four heart valves can develop stenosis, regurgitation of a combination of both stenosis and regurgitation. In case heart valve disease is not treated, it can have negative impact on a person’s quality of life and may even become life-threatening. During the past decades, great advances in the surgical treatment of heart valves disease have been achieved. This thesis will focus on the surgical treatment of aortic and pulmonary valve disease...|$|E

40|$|In chick {{and mouse}} embryogenesis, a {{population}} of cells described as the secondary heart field (SHF) adds both myocardium and smooth muscle to the developing cardiac outflow tract (OFT). Following this addition, at approximately HH stage 22 in chick embryos, for example, the SHF can be identified architecturally by an overlapping seam at the arterial pole, where beating myocardium forms a junction with the smooth muscle of the arterial system. Previously, using either immunohistochemistry or nitric oxide indicators such as diaminofluorescein 2 -diacetate, we have shown that a similar overlapping architecture also exists in the arterial pole of zebrafish and some shark species.

40|$|Objectives: Two {{methods have}} been {{described}} to assess fetal cardiac output (CO).

Recently CO has been assessed using 3 D spatio-temporal image correlation (STIC) to measure stroke volume. We aimed to compare the reproducibility of these techniques. Methods: In 27 women with singleton pregnancies, examinations were performed in three gestational age groups: 13 - 15, 19 - 21 and > 30 weeks of gestation. Each mother was scanned once. Using 2 D pulsed wave Doppler the duration of flow and average flow velocity in systole were measured through aortic and pulmonary valves. We averaged values from three consecutive Doppler complexes. The outlet valve diameters were measured and the cardiac output was calculated for each valve. The measurements were repeated to assess reproducibility. In the same women, we acquired STIC volumes of the fetal heart. The volume measurements were made using the 3 D Slice method by one observer. Using 2 mm slices the circumference of the ventricles was traced {{at the end of}} systole and diastole to calculate ventricular volume before and after contractions to calculate stroke volume and hence cardiac output. The measurements were repeated to assess reproducibility. Results: The root mean square difference of log (CO) of repeat measurements ranged between 0. 12 and 0. 21 using Doppler compared to 0. 7 to 1. 47 using STIC.

It is assumed that proper mixing is achieved by keeping the material in the blender tank at an appropriate level to achieve a suitable residence time.

40|$|Numerous {{physical}} {{models of the}} cardiovascular system have been devised for instructional purposes. In {{most or all of}} these models, the system is “open”; i. e., the liquid is exposed to atmospheric pressure {{at some point in the}} circuit, usually in the reservoir which represents the right atrium. The model to be described is a “closed ” system, comprised of four principal components: a pump, an arterial capacitance, a peripheral resistance, and a venous capacitance. The pump is servo-controlled, such that “cardiac output ” is a function of venous pressure (Frank-Starling mechanism). Also, because the model is a closed system, the venous pressure is a function of the cardiac output. The model there-fore assists the student in gaining insight into the interrelationships be-tween cardiac output and venous return. The student is able to construct “cardiac output ” and “venous return’ ” curves, as described by Guyton (1, 2), and to determine how these curves are affected by changes in a variety of circulatory variables, such as peripheral resistance, blood volume, and myocardial contractility. THE MECHANICAL MODEL The physical model is depicted schematically in Figure 1. The analog of the heart is a piston pump (Harvard Apparatus Co., model 1405) in which systole comprises 35 % of the cycle duration, and diastole occupies the remaining 65 %. The pump is equipped with silastic ball valves (Vi and Vo, the inflow and <b>outflow</b> <b>valves).</b> Stroke volume and heart rate are continuously variable (dials A and B). By special re-quest, the pump is equipped with a modulated control (Harvard Apparatus Co.) which regulates the stroke frequency. The electrical analog of the venous pressure is fed back to the modulated control through a cir-cuit (box C attached to pump) which must be designed specifically for the type of recorder being used to register venous pressure.

Patients: Mechanical valves (six tilting disc valves and two bileaflet valves) were implanted in eight patients previously operated on for tetralogy of Fallot (n = 7) and truncus arteriosus (n = 1), with severe right ventricular dysfunction caused by massive pulmonary regurgitation. Results: All patients survived prosthesis implantation and are currently well. At follow-up (3 months to 9 years), they do not show signs of valve failure, and right ventricular function has dramatically improved in all but one, who still shows moderate ventricular hypokinesia. Conclusion: After operative correction of congenital heart defects in selected patients who show severe dysfunction of the right ventricle caused by pulmonary regurgitation/stenosis, mechanical valves may represent an alternative to bioprosthetic valves. The selection of the valve type is still a matter of debate.

40|$|The torque {{characteristics}} of variable fill hydraulic dynamometers are investigated, particularly {{the phenomenon of}} self-emptying of Froude F type machines under open loop control. An integrated one-dimensional model is adapted from fluid coupling and torque converter theory to cover the steady-state case, and extended to the non-linear open loop dynamic cases by incorporating varying fluid fill and the dynamic governing equations for dynamometers. Two feedback systems are included to predict the closed loop behaviour of the machines. The effect of geometric variations on the steady-state torque capacity of dynamometers is given {{and the cause of}} the self-emptying phenomenon determined. It is found that the increase in working compartment fluid pressure with shaft speed leads to the fluid outflow rate becoming greater than the supplied inflow rate. Thus the fluid fill decreases. This phenomenon is further investigated using a dynamic model, consisting of a system of first order differential equations. The Adams-Bashforth Predictor Adams-Moulton Corrector numerical method is used to solve the system of equations. In addition to the self-emptying characteristic investigation, the differences between steady state and dynamic model predictions and the system responses to changes of set point and disturbances of its inputs (driving torque, <b>outflow</b> <b>valve</b> position, fluid inflow rate) are studied. To enable closed loop performance prediction, models of two feedback system are incorporated: a back pressure water outlet valve driven by a machine-speed oil-pump, and an electrohydraulic butterfly valve governed by direct digital control.

Since 1966 a conduit of homograft ascending aorta with its valve {{has been used}} for reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow. This technique has been applied to 123 operations for pulmonary autograft replacement of the aortic valve, 48 operations for correction of severe Fallot's tetralogy or pulmonary atresia, five operations for truncus arteriosus, two operations for transposition of the great arteries with ventricular septal defect, and six operations for tricuspid atresia or common ventricle. Ease of insertion and satisfactory function have encouraged us in the use of this form of conduit...|$|R
40|$|Three {{hundred and}} five {{patients}} routinely {{referred to a}} general hospital were surveyed to assess the advantages of cross-sectional echocardiography (CSE) over the conventional M mode method. CSE provided a dynamic display of {{the movement of the}} heart, particularly left ventricular function, and facilitated the location of cardiac structures. It was valuable in assessing the degree of mitral stenosis and the type of left ventricular <b>outflow</b> obstruction. Mitral <b>valve</b> prolapse, pericardial effusion, intracardiac tumours and congential heart disease were more easily diagnosed than by M mode techniques, but the origin of the basal systolic murmur still remained a problem. It was concluded that the 2 systems were complementary, and that CSE provided important additional information which improved the diagnostic capability of echocardiography...|$|R
40|$|SummaryPercutaneous {{pulmonary}} valve implantation {{now has a}} {{key role}} in the setting of dysfunctional right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduits or failing bioprosthetic pulmonary valves. However, despite the excellent results obtained with the two devices available currently (the Melody® valve [Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA] and the Edwards SAPIEN® valve [Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA]), many patients eligible for pulmonary valve replacement remain unsuitable for percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation, mainly because of large native outflow tracts. Accordingly, one of the major challenges for the future is to expand percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation to a broader population of patients. Moving forward, there is important ongoing research that is intended to improve patient outcomes, expand percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation therapy and continue to reduce the number of open-heart surgeries in this population. In this review, we underline the limitations and issues associated with the devices available currently, and we focus on the development of new strategies (such as hybrid approaches or magnetic resonance-guided procedures), new devices (such as right ventricular outflow tract reducers or the novel Native <b>Outflow</b> Tract <b>valved</b> stent from Medtronic) and new technologies (such as tissue-engineered valves), which may help to take up these challenges and represent the future of transcatheter valve implantation...|$|R
