He has answered all of <b>our</b> <b>questions</b> without hesitancy, and we are making every effort to find out if he is telling the truth or is covering up information. We are convinced that thus far the man has told the truth, and if all of his story is found to be true beyond the shadow of a doubt, we can no longer hold him as a suspect." [...] Gonzaullas also stated, [...] "Our duty is not only to apprehend violators of the law, but also to protect innocent persons. When we make an arrest in this case and charges are filed, there must be no mistake. We must get the right man or no man at all." [...] On Friday, May 3, the Gazette reported Gonzaullas' announcement that, [...] "This man has been completely eliminated. He has been checked and double checked and he couldn't have had anything to do with the murder cases here." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2007, Perverted-Justice {{was criticized}} {{following}} a sting operation in Collin County, Texas {{that resulted in}} the charges against 23 suspected online sex predators being dropped. Collin County Assistant District Attorney Greg Davis said the cases were dropped after Perverted-Justice failed to provide enough usable evidence. [...] "In many cases, we could not prosecute because Perverted Justice refused to answer <b>our</b> <b>questions,</b> refused to participate as witnesses, or refused to turn over potential evidence." [...] Susan Etheridge, director of the Children's Advocacy Center in Plano, Texas, was not surprised the cases were thrown out. She doubts the efficacy of a citizen-based group in conducting such a sting, [...] "I know that law enforcement works very hard to find and prosecute Internet predators. When citizens do it -- I don't know whether that can work. Perhaps policing is best left to the police." [...] Responding to the criticism, members of Perverted-Justice have stated on their website that they were never asked for the relevant evidence, never refused to provide witnesses, and answered all the Murphy Prosecutor's questions. They describe the Collin County District Attorney's Office as [...] "corrupt", [...] "inept", and [...] "incompetent", while labeling Collin County, Texas DA Greg Davis [...] "the biggest liar we've ever dealt with in our lives." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ali Muhammad {{was born}} on October 20, 1819, in Shiraz to a middle-class {{merchant}} of the city. His father was Muhammad Ridá, {{and his mother was}} Fátimih (1800–1881), a daughter of a prominent merchant in Shiraz. She later became a Bahá'í. His father died while he was quite young and he was raised by his maternal uncle, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid `Alí, who was also a merchant. He claimed to be a descendant from Muhammad (a sayyid) through Husayn ibn Ali through both his parents. When he was in Shiraz his uncle sent him to maktab (primary school) and he was there for six or seven years. Sometime between when he was 15 and 20, he joined his uncle in the family business, a trading house, and became a merchant in the city of Bushehr, Iran, near the Persian Gulf. Some of his earlier writings suggest that he did not enjoy the business and instead applied himself to the study of religious literature. One of his contemporary followers described him as [...] "very taciturn, and [...] would never utter a word unless it was absolutely necessary. He did not even answer <b>our</b> <b>questions.</b> He was constantly absorbed in his own thoughts, and was preoccupied with repetition of his prayers and verses. He is described as a handsome man with a thin beard, dressed in clean clothes, wearing a green shawl and a black turban." ...|$|E

We then investigate quantitatively the contribution of this question classifier to a feature driven question answering system.

60|$|And so Charley, {{with great}} discontent, came round, and was {{for some time}} evidently very uncomfortable; but as the evening went on, he became more at his ease, {{although}} it was ridiculous to hear the difference between his loud, jovial tone {{when he spoke to}} Harry, and his shy, disconnected way of speaking when he answered <b>our</b> <b>questions.</b>|$|E

6000|$|It {{was just}} then that Boyce came in. So {{soon as he}} spoke Davidson exclaimed: [...] "Old Boyce! Dead too! What a lark!"

He answered <b>our</b> <b>questions,</b> and asked us some of his own, but his attention seemed distracted by his hallucination about a beach and a ship. He kept interpolating observations concerning some boat and the davits and sails filling with the wind. It made one feel queer, in the dusky laboratory, to hear him saying such things.|$|E
6000|$|Before {{the smell}} of the deserted, oozing rooms, before that old {{creature}} leading us on and on, negligent of all <b>our</b> <b>questions,</b> and talking to the air, as though we were not, we felt such discomfort that we soon made to go out again into such freshness as there was on that day of dismal heat. Then realising, it seemed, that she was losing us, our old guide turned; for the first time looking in our faces, she smiled, and said in her sweet, weak voice, like the sound from the strings of a spinet long unplayed on: [...] "Don' you wahnd to see the dome-room: an' all the other rooms right here, of this old-time place?" ...|$|E

6000|$|A convulsive restlessness again {{seized upon}} the psychic, and [...] "Maudie" [...] {{asked us to}} sing. I hummed softly, in order to hear {{anything}} that might take place. A minute clicking sound at once developed, as though some one were lightly beating the cone with a key. These clicks answered <b>our</b> <b>questions.</b> It was [...] "Wilbur" [...] once more.

60|$|So we made {{ourselves}} into a society for asking questions. One {{of us was}} to visit a man-of-war; another was to hide herself in a scholar's study; another was to attend a meeting of business men; while all were to read books, look at pictures, go to concerts, keep our eyes open in the streets, and ask questions perpetually. We were very young. You can judge of our simplicity when I tell you that before parting that night we agreed that the objects of life were to produce good people and good books. <b>Our</b> <b>questions</b> were to be directed to finding out how far these objects were now attained by men. We vowed solemnly {{that we would not}} bear a single child until we were satisfied.|$|E
6000|$|We felt it proper, however, {{to shift}} the subject, and asked the Prince a few {{questions}} in regard to his views on American politics. We soon found that His Highness, although {{this is his first}} visit to this continent, is a keen student of our institutions and our political life. Indeed, His Altitude showed by his answers to <b>our</b> <b>questions</b> that he is as well informed about our politics as we are ourselves. On being asked what he viewed as the uppermost tendency in our political life of to-day, the Prince replied thoughtfully that he didn't know. To our inquiry as to whether in his opinion democracy was moving forward or backward, the Prince, after a moment of reflection, answered that he had no idea. On our asking which of the generals of our Civil War was regarded in Europe as the greatest strategist, His Highness answered without hesitation, [...] "George Washington." ...|$|E

60|$|From {{the ferry}} {{we had a}} walk of half a mile, more or less, to a cottage, where we found another young girl, whose {{business}} it is to show the Abbey. She was of another mould than the ferry-maiden,--a queer, shy, plaintive sort of a body,--and answered all <b>our</b> <b>questions</b> in a low, wailing tone. Passing through an apple-orchard, we were not long in reaching the Abbey, the ruins of which are much more extensive and more picturesque than those of Melrose, being overrun with bushes and shrubbery, and twined about with ivy, and all such vegetation as belongs, naturally, to old walls. There are {{the remains of the}} refectory, and other domestic parts of the Abbey, as well as the church, and all in delightful state of decay,--not so far gone but that we had bits of its former grandeur in the columns and broken arches, and in some portions of the edifice that still retain a roof.|$|E
60|$|He had {{received}} another stroke. He {{had lost his}} voice, or he was losing it. He had only intermittent use of it. As he phrased it, the wires were like the stock market, now up, now down. Occasionally the wires were up and he spoke as well as ever, though slowly and heavily. Then speech would suddenly desert him, {{in the middle of}} a sentence perhaps, and for hours, sometimes, we would wait for the connection to be re-established. He complained of great pain in his head, and it was during this period that he arranged a system of communication against the time when speech should leave him altogether—one pressure of the hand for “yes,” two for “no.” It was well that it was arranged, for by evening his voice had gone from him. By hand pressures, after that, he answered <b>our</b> <b>questions,</b> and when he wished to speak he scrawled his thoughts with his left hand, quite legibly, on a sheet of paper.|$|E
