40|$|An in-pile {{corrosion}} test loop is described {{which is used}} to study the effect of reactor radiation on the corrosion of materials of construction and the chemical stability of fuel solutions of interest to the Aqueous Homogeneous Reactor Program at ORNL. Aqueous solutions of uranyl sulfate are circulated in the loop by means of a 5 -gpm canned-rotor pump, and the pump loop is designed for operation at temperatures to 300 ts C and pressures to 2000 psia while exposed to reactor radiation in beam-hole facilities of the LITR and <b>ORR.</b> <b>Operation</b> of the first loop in-pile was begun in October 1954, and since that time 17 other in-pile loop experiments were completed. Design criteria of the pump loop and its associated auxiliary equipment and instrumentation are described. In-pile operating procedures, safety features, and operating experience are presented. A cost summary of the design, fabrication, and installation of the loop and experimental facillties is also included. (auth...|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} is the combined Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study Report {{for the lower}} Watts Bar Reservoir (LWBR) Operable Unit (OU). The LWBR is located in Roane, Rhea, and Meigs counties, Tennessee, and consists of Watts Bar Reservoir downstream of the Clinch river. This area has received hazardous substances released {{over a period of}} 50 years from the US Department of Energy`s Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR), a National Priority List site established under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). As required by this law, the ORR and all off-site areas that have received contaminants, including LWBR, must be investigated to determine the risk to {{human health and the environment}} resulting from these releases, the need for any remedial action to reduce these risks, and the remedial actions that are most feasible for implementation in this OU. Contaminants from the ORR are primarily transported to the LWBR via the Clinch River. There is little data regarding the quantities of most contaminants potentially released from the ORR to the Clinch River, particularly for the early years of <b>ORR</b> <b>operations.</b> Estimates of the quantities released during this period are available for most radionuclides and some inorganic contaminants, indicating that releases 30 to 50 years ago were much higher than today. Since the early 1970 s, the release of potential contaminants has been monitored for compliance with environmental law and reported in the annual environmental monitoring reports for the ORR...|$|R
40|$|The US Department of Energy {{currently}} oversees {{activities on}} the Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR), a government-owned, contractor-operated facility. Three sites compose the reservation: the Oak Ridge Y- 12 Plant, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and East Tennessee Technology Park (formerly the K- 25 Site). The ORR {{was established in the}} early 1940 s as part of the Manhattan Project, a secret undertaking that produced the materials for the first atomic bombs. The reservation`s role has evolved over the years, and it continues to adapt to meet the changing defense, energy, and research needs of the US. Both the work carried out for the war effort and subsequent research, development, and production activities have produced (and continue to produce) radiological and hazardous wastes. This document contains a summary of environmental monitoring {{activities on the}} ORR and its surroundings. Environmental monitoring on the ORR consists of two major activities: effluent monitoring and environmental surveillance. Effluent monitoring involves the collection and analysis of samples or measurements of liquid and gaseous effluents prior to release into the environment; these measurements allow the quantification and official reporting of contaminants, assessment of radiation exposures to the public, and demonstration of compliance with applicable standards and permit requirements. Environmental surveillance consists of the collection and analysis of environmental samples from the site and its environs; this provides direct measurement of contaminants in air, water, groundwater, soil, foods, biota, and other media subsequent to effluent release into the environment. Environmental surveillance data verify ORR`s compliance status and, combined with data from effluent monitoring, allow the determination of chemical and radiation dose/exposure assessment of <b>ORR</b> <b>operations</b> and effects, if any, on the local environment...|$|R
40|$|The Oak Ridge Reservation Annual Site Environmental Report is {{prepared}} animally and presents summary environmental data to (1) characterize environmental performance, (2) summarize environmental occurrences reported during the year, (3) confirm compliance with environmental standards and requirements, and (4) highlight significant program activities. The report fulfills the requirement contained in DOE Order 231. 1 A, Environment, Safety and Health Reporting (DOE 2004) that an integrated annual site environmental report be prepared. The results summarized {{in this report}} are based on data collected prior to and through 2009. This report {{is not intended to}} nor does it present the results of all environmental monitoring associated with the ORR. Data collected for other site and regulatory purposes, such as environmental restoration/remedial investigation reports, waste management characterization sampling data, and environmental permit compliance data, are presented in other documents that have been prepared in accordance with applicable DOE guidance and/or laws and are referenced herein as appropriate. Appendix A to this report identifies corrections to the 2008 report. Appendix B contains a glossary of technical terms that may be useful for understanding the terminology used in this document. Environmental monitoring on the ORR consists primarily of two major activities: effluent monitoring and environmental surveillance. Effluent monitoring involves the collection and analysis of samples or measurements of liquid and gaseous effluents at the points of release to the environment; these measurements allow the quantification and official reporting of contaminant levels, assessment of radiation and chemical exposures to the public, and demonstration of compliance with applicable standards and permit requirements. Environmental surveillance consists of direct measurements and collection and analysis of samples taken from the site and its environs exclusive of effluents; these activities provide information on contaminant concentrations in air, water, groundwater, soil, foods, biota, and other media. Environmental surveillance data support determinations regarding environmental compliance and, when combined with data from effluent monitoring, support chemical and radiation dose and exposure assessments regarding the potential effects of <b>ORR</b> <b>operations,</b> if any, on the local environment...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the clinical efficacy of sorafenib as preoperative neoadjuvant therapy {{in patients with}} high risk renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Clinical data of 18 patients with high risk RCC who received surgery done successfully after preoperative neoadjuvant therapy with sorafenib in Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) from April 2007 to October 2013 have been reviewed and analyzed in this study. Among the 18 patients there were 13 male and 5 female, with a median age of 54. 6 years. The objective response rate (<b>ORR)</b> of the <b>operation</b> on the selected patients is very high (94. 4 %), including 4 cases (22. 2 %) of partial response (PR) and 13 cases (72. 2 %) of stable disease (SD). After preoperative sorafenib treatment, the average tumor size of the 18 patients decreased from 7. 8 cm (ranging from 3. 6 to 19. 2 cm) to 6. 2 cm (ranging from 2. 4 to 16. 8 cm), and the median value of average tumor CT value decreased from 61 HU to 52 HU. Among the 5 patients who had IVC tumor thrombi, the grades of tumor thrombi in 2 patients who were grade II before sorafenib treatment became grade I and grade 0 respectively, 2 patients of grade III both became grade II. Preoperative neoadjuvant therapy with sorafenib for high risk RCC patients can significantly decrease primary tumor volume as well as tumor thrombus, which could help the nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) or radical nephrectomy to be done successfully...|$|R
40|$|DOE {{needs to}} {{continue}} the safe and efficient management of SNF on ORR, based on the requirement for future SNF storage capacity {{and implementation of the}} ROD for the PEIS. DOE is proposing to implement the ROD through proper management of SNF on ORR, including the possible construction and operation of a dry cask storage facility. This report describes the potentially affected environment and analyzes impacts on various resources due to the proposed action. The information provided in this report is intended to support the Environmental Assessment being prepared for the proposed activities. Construction of the dry cask storage facility would result in minimal or no impacts on groundwater, surface water, and ecological resources. Contaminated soils excavated during construction would result in negligible risk to human health and to biota. Except for noise from trucks and equipment, operation of the dry cask storage facility would not be expected to have any impact on vegetation, wildlife, or rare plants or animals. Noise impacts would be minimal. Operation exposures to the average SNF storage facility worker would not exceed approximately 0. 40 mSv/year (40 mrem/year). The off-site population dose within an 80 -km (50 -mile) radius of <b>ORR</b> from SNF <b>operations</b> would be less than 0. 052 person-Sv/year (5. 2 person-rem/year). Impacts from incident-free transportation on ORR would be less than 1. 36 X 10 {sup - 4 } occupational fatal cancers and 4. 28 X 10 {sup - 6 } public fatal cancers. Credible accident scenarios that would result in the greatest probable risks would cause less than one in a million cancer fatalities to workers and the public...|$|R
40|$|Zone 1 is a 1400 -acre area {{outside the}} fence {{of the main}} plant at The East Tennessee Technology Park (ETTP) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The Record of Decision for Interim Actions in Zone, ETTP (Zone 1 Interim ROD) (DOE 2002) {{identifies}} the remedial actions for contaminated soil, buried waste, and subsurface infrastructure necessary to protect human health and to limit further contamination of groundwater. Since the Zone 1 Interim Record of Decision (ROD) was signed, new information has been obtained that requires the remedy to be modified as follows: (1) Change the end use in Contractor's Spoil Area (CSA) from unrestricted industrial to recreational; (2) Remove Exposure Units (EU 5) ZI- 50, 51, and 52 from {{the scope of the}} Zone I Interim ROD; (3) Change the end use of the duct bank corridor from unrestricted industrial to restricted industrial; and (4) Remove restriction for the disturbance of soils below 10 feet in Exposure Unit (EU) Z 1 - 04. In accordance with 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 300. 435, these scope modifications are a 'significant' change to the Zone 1 Interim ROD. In accordance with CERCLA Sect. 117 (c) and 40 CFR 300. 435 (c) (2) (i), such a significant change is documented with an Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD). The purpose of this ESD is to make the changes listed above. This ESD is part of the Administrative Record file, and it, and other information supporting the selected remedy, {{can be found at the}} DOE Information Center, 475 Oak Ridge Turnpike, Oak Ridge, Tennessee 37830, from 8 : 00 a. m. to 5 : 00 p. m., Monday through Friday. The ORR is located in Roane and Anderson counties, within and adjacent to the corporate city limits of Oak Ridge, Tennessee. ETTP is located in Roane County near the northwest corner of the <b>ORR.</b> ETTP began <b>operation</b> during World War II as part of the Manhattan Project. The original mission of ETTP was to produce enriched uranium for use in atomic weapons. The plant produced enriched uranium from 1945 until 1985. Uranium production was terminated in 1987. ORR was placed on the National Priorities List in 1989, so remediation activities are conducted under CERCLA. The primary contaminants of concern at ETTP follow: (1) In groundwater - volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at multiple locations (trichloroethene is generally the most prevalent compound); (2) In sediment - inorganic elements, radionuclides, and polychlorinated biphenyls; (3) In soil - inorganic elements, radionuclides, semivolatile organic compounds (particularly the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), and VOCs; and (4) In facilities - radionuclides and polychlorinated biphenyls (abandoned facilities also pose a safety and health hazard to workers.) The purposes of the remedial actions selected in the Zone 1 Interim ROD are to allow unrestricted industrial use down to 10 feet and to remediate potential sources of groundwater contamination. Following is a summary of the major components of the Zone 1 Interim ROD remedy: (1) Excavation of the Blair Quarry burial area and associated contaminated soil; (2) Excavation of miscellaneous contaminated soil in the K- 895 Cylinder Destruct Facility area and in the Powerhouse Area; (3) Removal of sludge and demolition of the K- 710 sludge beds and Imhoff tanks; (4) Implementation of land use controls (LUCs); and (5) Characterization of soil and remediation of areas that exceed remediation levels...|$|R
