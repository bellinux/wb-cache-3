Femtosecond decay is detected at higher emission energies, while at lower energies a fluorescence rise time (∼ 3 ps) was observed that {{is dependent on the}} solvent’s polarity. A strong excitation energy dependence of the decay pattern was also observed. Different synthetic functional groups that comprise the macromolecular dendrimer structure were investigated. The mechanism, which describes the complex dynamics in the dendrimer system, was found {{to be associated with the}} excitation of the attached chromophore nitroaminostilbene.

40|$|Entangled {{states of}} light have been {{utilized}} successfully {{in a wide}} variety of experiments and applications. This dissertation will discuss the application of entangled states of light toward spectroscopy wherein entangled pairs of photons generated via the process of spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) are utilized to excite entangled two-photon absorption (ETPA) in organic molecules. An enhancement of the brightness of the SPDC entangled photon source under focused pumping conditions is discussed for the purpose of maximizing the entangled-pair flux available in these experiments. The entangled-pair flux utilized in ETPA experiments, however, still constitutes approximately 10 orders of magnitude fewer photons than any classical counterpart requires. Further, the effects of various conditions under which entangled photons are generated via the process of SPDC, specifically the phase-matching conditions and their resulting impact on the interaction of said photons with matter is presented. It is shown that spatial indistinguishability of entangled photons generated via SPDC is a necessary requirement for ETPA in organic nonlinear optical materials. Investigations of the ETPA response of a wide range of organic dendritic materials with differing geometry, donor-acceptor strength, and charge-transfer character are also presented, where it was observed that materials whose classical TPA cross-section is attributed to a dipole transition, without involvement of an intermediate state, were nearly transparent to entangled photons. In addition, the premiere demonstration of fluorescence from an <b>organic</b> <b>dendrimer</b> subsequent to two-photon excitation by entangled pairs of photons is presented. A novel, high geometric efficiency, spherically-enclosed optical collection system for collection of fluorescence photons is introduced, which is utilized to circumvent any drawbacks related to the weak quantum yield of the organic materials, and it is observed that the dependence of the rate of fluorescence collected from the material on the entangled excitation flux follows that of the ETPA response of the material. This is the first ever demonstration of the ETPEF phenomenon in any kind of material, and these novel results have widespread impact in applications ranging from spectroscopy to chemical and biological sensing, where the demonstration of the ETPEF phenomenon enables advancement in fields such as quantum imaging and microscopy...|$|E

The first generation organic benzyl alcohol and bromide wedges have been prepared, and a first generation <b>organic</b> <b>dendrimer</b> was synthesised. The preparation of novel organochromium dendrimers has been investigated. Several chromium arene complexes were prepared by different routes, and the halogenation methodology was thoroughly explored with various reagents. The target compound, a chromium complexed first generation dendritic wedge, was not accessible {{by any of the}} methods investigated. The novel compound (dibenzyl ether) bis[tricarbonylchromium(O) ] has been prepared by two routes and the crystal structure of this complex was determined. Several other chromium arene complexes were synthesised, and the crystal structure of one of these, (benzyl methyl ether) tricarbonylchromium(O), was determined. The structure and properties of the organic and organochromium dendrimers {{have been investigated}} by molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics techniques. The existing CHARMm polymer force field was extended to include parameters for the tricarbonylchromium moiety. The two crystal structures solved as part of the synthetic effort, were used in this regard. The accuracy of the new parameters was assessed by simulation of the crystal structure of (dibenzyl ether) bis[tricarbonylchromium(O) ]. The important ether linkage torsion angle parameter, which plays {{a significant role in the}} topology of the dendrimer, was singled out for refinement. The torsion angle was parameterised with the model compound benzyl phenyl ether, by fitting the CHARMm results for rotation about the dihedral, to ab initio torsional data. Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed on generations one through five of the organic and organochromium dendrimers. The radius of gyration and RMS variation were investigated as a function of generation for both dendrimer series. The radius of gyration was found to increase exponentially with generation, whereas the relationship of RMS variation to generation was not as well defined. Density distributions were calculated for all five generations of the organic and organometallic dendrimers. In addition, the distribution of the monomers from each generation within the dendrimer was analysed. In the later generation dendrimers, the monomers belonging to the earlier generations are extended, while the terminal groups are mobile and found in all regions of the dendrimer. The solvent accessible surface was calculated for the organochromium dendrimers. It was concluded from these results that although the terminal groups are mobile, the majority of these monomers remain on the periphery of the dendrimer, or in solvent accessible areas...|$|E

40|$|A {{custom-built}} surface sol-gel {{pumping system}} {{was built for}} applying conformal sol-gel based coatings with controlled thicknesses on three-dimensional (3 -D) nanostructured templates. The 3 -D templates utilized in this work were derived from biological species, such as diatoms and butterfly wings, {{as well as a}} synthetic photoresist polymer (SU- 8). Tin oxide coatings were applied on silica-based diatom frustules using the automated surface sol-gel pumping system. An <b>organic</b> <b>dendrimer</b> method was developed for amplifying hydroxyl groups on the silica-based frustule surfaces to enhance the surface sol-gel deposition process. Conformal tin oxide coatings with controlled thicknesses were obtained on the hydroxyl amplified frustule surfaces; however, little if any deposition was observed on the frustules that were not subjected to the hydroxyl amplification process. The automated surface sol-gel system was also utilized to apply multicomponent tin oxide-doped titania alkoxide chemistries on the wing scales of a blue Morpho butterfly. The alkoxide solutions reacted directly with the OH functionalities provided by the native chitin chemistry of the scales. The tin oxide served as a rutile nucleating agent which allowed the titania to completely crystallize in the high refractive index rutile titania phase with doping concentrations of tin oxide as low as 7 mol % after annealing at 450 oC. The tin oxide-doped titania coatings were both nanocrystalline and nanothick and replicated the nanostructured scales {{with a high degree of}} precision. Undoped titania coatings applied on the scales required a heat treatment of 900 oC to crystallize the coating in the rutile titania phase which led to adverse coarsening effects which destroyed the nanostructed features of the scales. Tin oxide-doped titania coatings were also deposited on 3 -D SU- 8 photonic crystal structures. The coating was crystallized in an acidic solution at 80 oC which led to the formation of rutile titania inverse opal photonic crystal structures which maintained the overall structure and ordering of the template. Barium titanate and europium-doped barium titanate coatings were applied on diatom frustules using a conventional reflux/evaporation deposition process. The silica-based diatom frustules had to first be converted into magnesia/silicon composite replicas using a gas/solid displacement reaction to render the template chemically compatible with the barium titanate-based coating. Conformal titanate-based coatings were obtained on the magnesia frustule replicas possessing uncontrolled thicknesses and excess inorganic particles using the reflux/evaporation deposition process. The europium-doped barium titanate coated frustules exhibited bright red photoluminescent properties upon stimulation with an ultraviolet light source. Ph. D.

40|$|We {{present a}} study of the {{picosecond}} fluorescence dynamics of pi-conjugated semiconducting <b>organic</b> <b>dendrimers</b> in the solid state. By varying the degree of branching within the dendrons, referred to as the dendrimer generation, a control of intermolecular spacing of the emissive core and therefore of the lattice parameter for Forster-type energy transfer is achieved. This allows a distinction between spectral diffusion and excimer formation as the two main sources of spectral broadening in organic semiconductors. Whereas Forster-type dispersive spectral relaxation is independent of temperature but strongly dependent on the interchromophore distance, excimer formation is also strongly thermally activated due to temperature-dependent conformational changes and the influence of thermally activated dynamic disorder. The rapid spectral diffusion allows a determination of the excimer rise in the emission, which is shown to have a profound impact on the steady state luminescence properties of dendrimer films. We show that the dendrimer generation not only allows a microscopic control of intermolecular interactions but also a direct control of the rate of spectral diffusion.

40|$|This thesis {{was focused}} on the {{investigation}} of the linear optical properties of novel two photon absorbers for biomedical applications. Substituted imidazole and imidazopyridine derivatives, and <b>organic</b> <b>dendrimers</b> were studied as potential fluorophores for two photon bioimaging. The results obtained showed superior luminescence properties for sulphonamido imidazole derivatives compared to other substituted imidazoles. Imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridines exhibited an important dependence on the substitution pattern of their luminescence properties. Substitution at imidazole ring led to a higher fluorescence yield than the substitution at the pyridine one. Bis-imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridines of Donor-Acceptor-Donor type were examined. Bis-imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridines dimerized at C 3 position had better luminescence properties than those dimerized at C 5, displaying high emission yields and important 2 PA cross sections. Phosphazene-based dendrimers with fluorene branches and cationic charges on the periphery were also examined. Due to aggregation phenomena in polar solvents, the dendrimers registered a significant loss of luminescence with respect to fluorene chromophore model. An improved design of more rigid chromophores yields enhanced luminescence properties which, connected to large 2 PA cross-sections, make this compounds valuable as fluorophores in bioimaging. The photophysical study of several ketocoumarine initiators, designed for the fabrication of small dimension prostheses by two photon polymerization (2 PP) was carried out. The compounds showed low emission yields, indicative of a high population of the triplet excited state, which is the active state in producing the reactive species. Their efficiency in 2 PP was proved by fabrication of microstructures and their biocompatibility was tested in the collaborator’s laboratory. In the frame of the 2 PA photorelease of drugs, three fluorene-based dyads have been investigated. They were designed to release the gamma-aminobutyric acid via two photon induced electron transfer. The experimental data in polar solvents showed a fast electron transfer followed by an almost equally fast back electron transfer process, which indicate a poor optimization of the system. ...|$|R

The identification of catalytic active sites is a very vivid area of investigation encompassing a variety of disciplines, from basic research to applied engineering.

Academic and industrial scientists are searching for a detailed understanding of light harvesting and find tools to control the electron transfer between donor and acceptor molecules. Due to their electronic properties and the ability to tune their absorption ranges, conjugated dendrimers combined with polymers are used extensively {{in the formation of the}} active layer (donor- acceptor) in <b>organic</b> photovoltaic [1]. <b>Dendrimers</b> and hyperbranched polymers are considered to be the leading materials used in the application of organic solar cells. They are low viscosity with high molecular weights, good solubility and mutifunctionality. Dendrimers are perfect monodisperse macromelcular (tree-like structures) with high branched three-dimensional structures: core, branches, and end groups [1, 2]. Organic bulk-heterojunction structure (OBHJ) consist of donor and acceptor (active layer) blend together deposited between two electrodes in order to gain a large interface area between donor and acceptor [3]. However, charge mobility through the OBHJ active layer strongly depends on the morphology of surface of the active layer. thus, dendrimers materials with their small size and monodisperse nature leads to a high degree of ordering in organic solar cell devices and thus high carrier mobilities [2, 3].

40|$|Organic ? ordered {{mesoporous}} silica (OMS) hybrid materials have attracted great interest {{due to their}} potential applications for gas separations, and heterogeneous catalysis. Amine-functionalized OMS materials are active {{in a variety of}} base-catalyzed reactions. The key to successfully achieving the desired reactivity is the ability to rationally tether the targeted organic functionality onto the OMS surface. Understanding the organic-inorganic interface is crucial for rational design of heterogeneous catalysts, because the local structure and molecule dynamics are paramount in determining the reactivity of the organic groups attached to the OMS surface. This dissertation focuses on three goals that will lead to a description of the organic-OMS interface and designing hybrid catalysts: 1) Determining the dynamics of organic groups attached to the OMS surface, 2) Catalytic testing to understand how the local structure and dynamics of the organic moiety influence the catalytic properties of organic-OMS catalysts, 3) Designing more active hybrid catalysts by introducing higher loadings of <b>organic</b> group using <b>dendrimer</b> structures. Solid-state NMR is uniquely suited for quantifying dynamics in the milli- to nano-second time scale. Deuterium (2 H) NMR is a powerful tool to obtain detailed information about the dynamics or organic molecules. In this study, several simple functional groups isotopically labeled with deuterium have been attached to MCM- 41 and SBA- 15. The spectra display different molecular motions for different organic moieties. The results have indicated that the interactions between the functional groups and silanol groups on the surface influence the mobility of the organic fragments. Also, the porosity of the solid supports effects dynamics via confinement. The catalytic properties of simple amine groups attached to MCM- 41, containing primary, secondary, and tertiary amines have been compared in the Nitroaldol (Henry) reaction. The effects of amine identity, structure, loading, presence of surface silanols, and the substrate topology on the catalytic properties have been investigated. The dramatic decrease of the activity of amine-functionalized MCM- 41 by capping the residual silanol groups with hexamethyldisilazane was ascribed to the decrease of the interactions of hydrogen bonding between the amine functional groups and surface silanols. The result was consistent with the changes of the molecular motions shown by 2 H NMR measurements. Fabricating OMS hybrid materials with high densities of organic functional groups leads to challenges in realizing uniform, catalytically active sites. Our group has immobilized melamine-based dendrimers on the surfaces of amine-functionalized SBA- 15 materials by iterative synthesis procedures. The current studies in this dissertation mainly describe the catalytic properties of these dendrimers on SBA- 15 and MCM- 41 in the Nitroaldol (Henry) reaction, the transesterification reaction of triglycerides and methanol to synthesize methyl esters, and the cross aldol reaction between acetone and 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural.
