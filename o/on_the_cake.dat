Paris Saint-Germain's defence of the League Cup {{continued}} against Nancy after the draw for the last-16, quarter-finals and semi-finals was made. Péguy Luyindula scored both goals in Paris Saint-Germain's victory over Nancy to send the holders {{through to the}} quarter-finals of the League Cup. In a dramatic twist of fate, Paris Saint-Germain hosted Lens in the pick of the quarter-final draw.

Late goals from Souleymane Diawara and Wendel added to David Bellion's first-half strike put the icing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> as Bordeaux cruised past Paris Saint-Germain in the League Cup semi-final at the Parc des Princes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the return}} {{leg of the}} quarter final tie, the Mariners {{demolished}} Salgaocar 4–0 riding on a brace from Haitian playmaker Sony Norde and goals from Katsumi Yusa and Jeje Lalpekhlua. It was Katsumi Yusa who started the scoring in the 25th minute reaching {{at the end of}} a Sony Norde cross and tapping it easily into an open net. Minutes away from the half time whistle Sony Norde scored his first of the match and the tournament as he beautifully cut in from the left and put the ball in the net past the goalkeeper to ensure that Bagan went into the lemon break with a 3-goal advantage on aggregate. The Green and Maroon brigade started off the second half, where they ended the first. It was a piece of individual brilliance by Haitian playmaker Sony Norde as he went past three Salgaocar defenders and put the ball in the net with relative ease to score his second of the night. In the final minute of the match, a beautiful through ball from Cornell Glen saw Jeje Lalpekhlua tap it in with utter ease to put the icing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> of the Green and Maroon victory.|$|E

In the late 19th century historians investigated the origins of the legend. It was suggested that the twins had genuinely existed but had been joined at the hip only rather than at both the hip and shoulder, and that they had lived in the 16th rather than the 12th century.|$|E
