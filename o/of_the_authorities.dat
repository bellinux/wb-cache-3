5|$|Although {{the custom}} had {{no basis in}} law and {{frequently}} resulted in prosecution, particularly from the mid-19th century onwards, the attitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> was equivocal. At least one early 19th-century magistrate is on record as stating {{that he did not}} believe he had the right to prevent wife sales, and there were cases of local Poor Law Commissioners forcing husbands to sell their wives, rather than having to maintain the family in workhouses.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe's {{homosexual}} {{activities from}} time to time came to the attention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authorities,</b> and were investigated by the police; information was added to his MI5 file, but in no case was action taken against him. In 1971 he survived a party inquiry after a complaint against him by Norman Scott, a riding instructor and would-be model. Scott maintained that in the early 1960s he had been in a sexual relationship with Thorpe, who had subsequently mistreated him. The inquiry dismissed the allegations.|$|E
5|$|After Germany {{occupied}} Hungary in March 1944, the genocidal policies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> {{were applied}} comprehensively. Hungarian Jews {{were subjected to}} starvation and death marches, and those that had remained {{in the occupied territories}} were transported to extermination camps. From 26 April 1944, the remaining Jews in Bačka and Baranja, mostly women, but including children and the elderly, were rounded up into local concentration camps then moved to larger camps in Hungary proper. Between 14,000 and 15,000 Jews from Bačka, Baranja and other parts of Hungary were collected at Baja and Bácsalmás then transported to Auschwitz where most were killed. In September 1944, the workforce of the Bor mine was force-marched for several weeks back to extermination camps where the survivors were killed. One of the two groups of workers numbered 2,500, but only a few survived.|$|E

5|$|At 9:00pm three Guards regiments {{arrived on}} the scene. Although the troops {{assisted}} in crowd control, their arrival was also a reaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> to fears of a possible insurrection, for which the destruction of parliament could have signalled the first step. The three European revolutions of 1830—the French, Belgian and Polish actions—were still of concern, as were the unrest from the Captain Swing riots, and the recent passing of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, which altered the relief provided by the workhouse system.|$|E

5|$|On {{his arrival}} in New Zealand Stenhouse learned that nothing had been heard from Shackleton and the Weddell Sea party since their {{departure}} from South Georgia in December 1914; it seemed probable that both arms of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition were requiring relief. Stenhouse was informed by the expedition offices in London that funds had long since been exhausted and that money for the necessary work on Aurora {{would have to be}} found elsewhere.

5|$|The {{first to}} arrive at the crime scene were the {{municipal}} authorities of Los Cabos, followed by the Mexican Armed Forces and the federal and state police forces. Upon the arrival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authorities,</b> Francisco Rafael's wife—in between tears—informed them of the former drug lord's identity. The autopsy revealed that Francisco Rafael died of severe traumatic brain injury from shots in the thorax and head with a FN Five-seven pistol. The murder of Francisco Rafael initially fell under state jurisdiction because he was not wanted by the federal government when he was killed. Therefore, the murder investigation was started by the Baja California Sur authorities and not by the Office of the General Prosecutor (PGR). However, the PGR joined the case after it was requested by the state authorities.|$|E
5|$|Aqil {{secured a}} durable {{alliance}} with the Beni Sakhr, consecrated through his marriage to a woman from the tribe. From Transjordan, he and his band of irregulars raided areas {{on both sides of}} the Jordan River until he was invited back to the Galilee by Acre's kaimakam in 1847. The latter had sought to neutralize Aqil and his allies' marauding activities, and thus pardoned Aqil. He was also given command of 75 bashi-bazouk in Lower Galilee. Thereafter, he was commissioned with overseeing that region's security. In particular, the successive governors of Acre entrusted him with protecting the Galilee's trade routes and maintaining general security in the area, which he did successfully. With time, he became an unofficial mutasallim (tax collector) for much of northern Palestine, including the Jezreel Valley, Safad, Tiberias and Nazareth. The tax he collected was not on behalf <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authorities,</b> but rather a tribute payment (khuwwa) to receive his protection. While this unofficial system proved successful in guaranteeing local security, later historians criticized it as akin to a protection racket.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{opted to}} field an {{unchanged}} lineup for the Second Test at Lord's, {{the home of}} cricket. Before the match, Barnes wagered £8 at 15/1 on himself to score a century, and trained especially diligently in the lead-up to the Lord's fixture. He was motivated because the Australian Board of Control had given his wife rare permission to attend the match, and the refusal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> at Lord's {{to allow him to}} practise there when he was in London a year earlier; Barnes saw a strong personal performance as an ideal response to what he regarded as a snub. On the first morning, Bradman won the toss and elected to bat, and Barnes continued his run of low scores since the First Test. The first over bowled by Bedser to Barnes was watchfully played to complete a maiden. The debutant Alec Coxon opened the bowling with Bedser and removed Barnes for a duck in his second over, caught by Len Hutton at short fine leg. Barnes tried to knock the short delivery through square leg but misjudged the pace of the wicket and played his shot too early, mishitting the ball to Hutton, and leaving Australia at 1/3. They eventually reached 350 and bowled England out for 215 early on the third day.|$|E

5|$|Despite the ruthlessness and {{determination}} of the supporters of the coup, the rebels failed to take any major cities with the critical exception of Seville which provided a landing point for Franco’s African troops. The primarily conservative and Catholic areas of Old Castile and León fell quickly, and in Pamplona they celebrated the uprising {{as if it were}} a festival. The government retained control of Málaga, Jaén and Almería. Cadiz was taken for the rebels with the help of the first troops from the Army of Africa. In Madrid they were hemmed into the Montaña barracks. The barracks fell the next day, with much bloodshed. Republican leader Santiago Casares Quiroga was replaced by José Giral who ordered the distribution of weapons among the civilian population. This facilitated the defeat of the army insurrection in the main industrial centres, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and other main cities in the Mediterranean area, but it allowed the anarchists to arm themselves and take control of Barcelona and large swathes of Aragon and Catalonia. In Barcelona, the official government lost control of security, essential services and welfare. However, the anarchists held back from demanding too much political power, which could have had even more serious consequences. General Goded surrendered in Barcelona and was later condemned to death, despite broadcasting a message explaining his captivity over the radio at the request <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authorities.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eyre and {{the crew}} were landed and marched to Antibes, where they were imprisoned with the crew of a Sardinian frigate that had been {{captured}} the day before Speedy. The crew had been imprisoned on Martin's flagship Sans Culotte and had been severely treated, with their captain, Ross, not being allowed to wash or shave. The British were placed in a dungeon at Antibes, with only straw to lie on, awaiting the decision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authorities.</b> After three weeks in this state, they were marched to Aix-en-Provence and were confined in the prison there. After a month imprisoned in Aix, Maximilien Robespierre fell and the Reign of Terror came to an end. The British were paroled. Eyre and the officers were taken to Romans, in Dauphiné where Eyre remained until May 1795 when he was released {{in exchange for a}} French officer. He faced a court-martial for the loss of Speedy, but was honourably acquitted.|$|E
5|$|Once it was {{determined}} that the mountain was the highest point in the region, the succession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> that held control over it took an interest in its name and changed it periodically for symbolic reasons. In 1896, as part of Austria-Hungary, the highest peak of the Carpathians received its first government-sponsored name − after the contemporary head of state Emperor Francis Joseph I. Guidebooks sometimes did not catch up on these name changes. After the dissolution of the monarchy in 1918, the mountain continued to be known simply as Gerlachovský štít because it belonged to the village of Gerlachov. The Polish government, claiming the territory of the High Tatras for Poland, simultaneously called the mountain Szczyt Polski (Polish Peak), but never gained control over it. The new Czechoslovak government changed the name to Štít legionárov (Legionnaires Peak) in honor of the Czechoslovak Legions in 1923, but the name was dropped in favor of the earlier Gerlachovský štít in 1932. As a result of the Communist coup d'état in 1948, the mountain was renamed once more − to Stalinov štít (Stalin Peak) in 1949. Its traditional name Gerlachovský štít was restored yet again a decade later and has remained unchanged through the present.|$|E

5|$|The Latvian {{government}} took {{a number of}} steps {{in order to try}} to bring the situation under control, and in 2006 not only were the events planned by right wing organizations not approved, but the monument was fenced off, according to an announcement by Riga city council, for restoration. The monument was indeed restored in 2006, but this statement was later questioned, as politicians named various other reasons for the change of date, the enclosed area was much larger than needed for restoration, and the weather appeared inappropriate for restoration work. Therefore, the government was criticized by the Latvian press for being unable to ensure public safety and freedom of speech. The unapproved events took place despite the ban. On November 23, 2006, the law requiring the approval <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> for public gatherings was ruled unconstitutional. In the future years the government mobilized the police force to guard the neighborhood of the monument and the events were relatively peaceful.|$|E
