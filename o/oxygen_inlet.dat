The objective is to obtain the expression that would predict the conversion performance of the catalysts for different values of the SCR process parameters, namely temperature, <b>inlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentration and <b>inlet</b> ammonia concentration. The NOx emission, its formation and control methods are discussed briefly and then the fundamentals of the SCR process are described. Heat transfer based and chemical kinetics based SCR process models are discussed and widely used rate order based model are reviewed. Based on the experimental data, regression analysis was performed that gives an expression for predicting the SCR rate for the complete temperature range and the rate order with respect to <b>inlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> and ammonia concentration. The average activation energy for the SCR process was calculated and optimum operating conditions were determined {{for each of the}} catalyst. The applicable operating range for the catalyst depends on the NO conversion {{as well as on the}} ammonia slip and the N 2 O and NO 2 emission. The regression analysis was repeated for the applicable range and an expression was obtained that can be used to estimate the catalyst performance. For the Cu-ZSM- 5, the best performance was observed for 400 oC, 660 ppm inlet ammonia concentration and 0. 1 % <b>inlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentration. For the V based honeycomb monolith catalyst, the best performance was observed for 300 oC, 264 ppm inlet ammonia concentration and 3 % <b>inlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentration. For the V-Ti based PLIC catalyst, the best performance was observed for 350 oC, 330 ppm inlet ammonia concentration and 3 % <b>inlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentration. For the V-Ti-W based honeycomb monolith catalyst, the best performance was observed for 300 oC, 330 ppm inlet ammonia concentration and 3 % <b>inlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentration. The conversion performance of all of these catalysts is satisfactory for the industrial application. At the operating conditions listed above, the N 2 O emission is less than 20 ppm and the NO 2 emission is less than 10 ppm. The results were validated by comparing the findings with the similar work by other research groups. The mechanism of SCR process is discussed for each of the catalyst. The probable reactions are listed and adsorption and desorption process are studied. The various mechanisms proposed by the researchers are discussed briefly. It is concluded that V-Ti-W and Cu-ZSM- 5 catalyst are very promising for SCR of NOx. The expressions can be used to estimate the conversion performance and can be utilized for optimal design and operation. The expressions relate the SCR rate to the input parameters such as temperature and <b>inlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> and ammonia concentration hence by controlling these parameters desired NOx reduction can be achieved with minimal cost and emission...|$|R

Central composite experimental design (CCD) and response surface methodology (RSM) were utilized {{to determine the}} best operating condition for maximum ethylene production. The design led to three surface responses describing the dependence of methane conversion, ethylene yield, and ethylene selectivity on operating temperature (737 - 913 Â°C), <b>inlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentration (6. 2 - 23. 8 vol. %) and F/W (9280 - 35, 720 ml/g h).

After the chlorine activation step at 440 °C the oxygen free sample shows a strong sulfur diffusion whereas samples with low <b>oxygen</b> <b>inlet</b> show a suppressed diffusion.

40|$|Sewage sludge is an {{inevitable}} waste stream from wastewater treatment and its disposal is complicated due to specific characteristics of its composition. Sewage sludge combustion/incineration {{is the only}} suitable way for disposal of large volumes of sewage sludge containing POPs and some heavy metals. Sewage sludge combustion reduces the volume of such waste and causes destruction of organic contaminants. Oxy-fuel combustion is a technology for simplifying CO 2 sequestration from the flue gas by using nearly pure oxygen instead of air for the combustion. In order to control the combustion temperature, part of the flue gas is recycled to combustion chamber. The paper brings information about investigation {{of the effects of}} combustion temperature and concentration of <b>oxygen</b> in <b>inlet</b> combustion media on the emissions of NOx, N 2 O and SO 2 in FB combustion of sewage sludge. The experimental results have shown that an increase in combustion temperature leads to an increase in NOx and to a decrease in N 2 O emissions in the temperature range 750 – 930 °C. The lowest SO 2 emissions were measured in the temperature interval from 800 to 820 °C in all experiments with different <b>oxygen</b> concentration in <b>inlet</b> gas.

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to obtain data on the {{efficiency}} of nitric oxide (NO) reduction by reburning under oxy-fuel conditions. The work {{was carried out in}} a 100 kW test facility fired with propane. The data were analyzed by means of a combustion model, which included {{a detailed description of the}} reburning chemistry. The importance of several combustion parameters on the reburning efficiency was studied: <b>inlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentration, flue gas recycle ratio, temperature, and stoichiometric ratio. The <b>inlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentration was kept between 25 and 37 vol % and the burner stoichiometric ratio between 0. 7 and 1. 15. NO was injected in the oxidizer. As expected, similar to air-firing, reburning in oxy-fuel is favored by substoichiometric conditions. A decrease in combustion temperature, caused by a lowered stoichiometric ratio, is shown to be advantageous for reduction of NO under oxy-fuel conditions. The effect of <b>inlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentration on reburning is not significant as long as the combustion conditions are fuel-lean. However, the amount of recycled flue gas, which increases with decreasing oxygen content, significantly improves the total reduction. Instead, when the stoichiometric ratio is decreased, the recycle flow of the flue gas is reduced, which, to some extent, counteracts the otherwise positive effect of fuel-rich conditions in the flame zone in oxy-fuel conditions. Thus, during oxygen-rich combustion, the total reburning efficiency in oxy-fuel combustion is superior to once-through reburning in air-firing, but during substoichiometric conditions, the reduction in air and oxy-fuel combustion is comparable...|$|R

On increasing the O 2 content, the CO selectivity decreases. An increase of the oxygen content anticipates the activation of the H 2 oxidation, thus competing with CO oxidation. Conversely, at low values of the O 2 content, the H 2 oxidation is activated only after an almost complete CO oxidation is obtained. From the results it appears that the temperature control and management in the reactor is a key for increasing the CO selectivity at high CO conversion...|$|E

40|$|Oxy-fuel {{combustion}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} promising technologies to capture CO 2 from power plants. The concept is to burn the fuel in a mixture of oxygen and recirculated flue gases instead of air. The resulting flue gases will then mainly be composed by CO 2 and H 2 O. One interesting feature of oxy-fuel combustion is that the emission of NOx may be heavily reduced by reburning reactions due to the recycle of flue gases. In addition, experiments performed in Chalmers 100 kWth oxy-fuel unit with propane as a fuel showed a strongly increased reduction of NO when <b>inlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentration was increased above 35 %. Under these conditions an increased soot formation was also observed. Therefore, could be inferred that soot formation could play some role in the reduction of NO and interactions between nitrogen and soot chemistry might take place. The aim of this work is to identify and describe possible interactions that could take place, of interest to explain the observed NO reduction trends. The investigation is based on combustion modeling, with focus on chemistry. Detailed reaction mechanisms from literature, relevant to nitrogen and soot chemistry were implemented and the sensitivity of results to combustion conditions was investigated. The modeling results showed that temperature, <b>inlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentration and mixing assumptions are important to radical pool and to determine the rates of key-reactions in both soot and nitrogen chemistry. In particular, an increasing soot formation was observed when local temperature and <b>inlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentration were increased in the model, with major importance of the former. In the same way, when the local stoichiometry was changed to a more oxygen-lean environment, the soot formation increased. On the other hand, nitrogen oxides showed characteristic trends in the reactor in all the simulations, with chemistry-based sections clearly detectable. The outlet NO concentration increased when the flame and post-flame temperature increased, whereas decreased when <b>inlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentration was increased. Stoichiometry acted on the local NO concentration and reburning, with low impact on outlet NO. However, the homogeneous NO reduction was not as high as in experiments, confirming the possible intervention of other phenomena, such as soot-NO interactions. The mechanisms that were identified in this work consisted essentially in homogeneous and heterogeneous ones. Homogeneous interactions that take place on a soot precursors’ level, mainly seen as competition for radicals between reburning and gas-phase soot chemistry. Heterogeneous interactions involving soot particles both as reactants and as catalyzers could be seen in flame and post flame regions. In conclusion, interactions could be a key-process to explain the enhanced NO reduction seen in the experiments at high <b>inlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentrations...|$|R

The first igniter tested was an impinging injection, spark-initiated torch igniter, {{and the second}} was a microwave-generated plasma igniter. The purpose of the ignition tests was to define the ignition limits under vacuum conditions and characterize the transient start-up performance {{as a function of}} propellant mixture ratio (MR), mass flow rates, inlet temperatures, and pre-ignition chamber pressure. In addition, for the impinging igniter two different spark plugs were tested, and for the microwave igniter the magnetron filament warm-up time and the magnetron input power were both varied. The results gathered from these tests indicated that the impinging igniter is capable of operating over an MR range of 2 - 27, with methane and <b>oxygen</b> <b>inlet</b> temperatures as low as - 161 F and - 233 F, respectively. The microwave igniter was tested over an MR range of 2 - 9, with methane and <b>oxygen</b> <b>inlet</b> temperatures as low as - 90 F and - 200 F, respectively. The microwave igniter achieved ignition over this range, although an upper ignition limit was determined for the oxidizer mass flow rate. In general, the torch exhaust temperatures for the microwave igniter were not as high as those attained with the impinging igniter. The microwave igniter, however, was hot-fired 17 times and was still operational, whereas the impinging igniter spark plugs experienced thermal shock and erosion over nine hot-fire tests. It was concluded that for the microwave igniter better mixing of the propellants might be required in order to both raise the torch exhaust temperature and decrease the required magnetron input power, and for the impinging igniter the spark plug position within the igniter chamber should be varied in future tests to identify a more optimal location.

The conducted experiments include a comprehensive parameter study: NO was {{injected into the}} recycled flue-gas, the inlet oxygen concentration was varied between 25 and 37 vol. % and the stoichiometric ratios at the burner inlet ranged from 0. 7 and 1. 15. The respective influence of inlet oxygen concentration and burner stoichiometry on once-through and total reduction of NO was measured. Furthermore, concentration and temperature in the furnace were mapped to identify important differences between oxy and air-fired conditions.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental kinetic {{study for the}} oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) over a Mn/Na 2 WO 4 /SiO 2 catalyst prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. Because the catalyst is a reducible metal oxide, {{the stability of the}} catalyst has been assessed by Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA). These experiments show that the catalyst has to be pre-treated with oxygen in order to obtain high C 2 selectivity (around 85 %) and that a low oxygen partial pressure during the OCM reactions is already sufficient to maintain the catalyst stable in the oxidized state. The catalyst has subsequently been tested in a micro-catalytic fixed bed reactor. The overall reaction orders and rate constants of the primary reactions were determined by measuring the intrinsic reaction rates at different methane and <b>oxygen</b> <b>inlet</b> concentrations. It was found that the reaction order in oxygen for the coupling reaction is 0. 38, while the reaction order in oxygen for ethylene oxidation approaches unity, indicating that low oxygen concentration levels are beneficial for obtaining a high C 2 selectivity (up to 80 – 90 %). Such a low oxygen concentration can be obtained with distributive feeding in a membrane reactor. Based on the experiments and least-squares minimization, a simplified reaction mechanism is proposed, where the dependency of the ethane (coupling) and carbon dioxide (oxidation) production rates and the secondary ethylene production and C 2 oxidation rates can be described with power-law type reaction rate expressions...|$|E

40|$|In {{the case}} of plasma ion {{assisted}} deposition (PIAD) processes either quartz crystal monitoring or optical monitoring are commonly applied to control thickness of the layers. For several oxide layer materials the final stoichiometry of the deposited film is extremely sensitive to the <b>oxygen</b> gas <b>inlet</b> during the deposition process. It is well known, that under these circumstances, variations in the reaction gas flow or in deposition rates may cause unwanted variations of the stoichiometry of the coating.

For this reason, the correlation between optical performance of the coating and emission spectra of the APS-plasma measured by a separate analyzer has been investigated. The synchronization in recording in-situ transmission spectra and plasma emission spectra was achieved by developing a common trigger unit for both spectrum analyzers.

Unbalanced (UB) and balanced (B) cathodes were utilized and the time-averaged power delivered to the plasma was set to either 400 or 800 W. The total energy flux was measured in situ thanks to a heat flux sensor located at the substrate position. First, the energy flux exhibits a hysteresis when the <b>oxygen</b> <b>inlet</b> is increased and then decreased. In a second step, the normalized energy flux (φnorm) was calculated by {{taking into account the}} number of Ti atoms deposited per time unit and the discharge regimes were compared accordingly. Regardless of the sputtering method, the film phase constitution evolves from pure anatase to rutile rich anatase/rutile phase mixtures as φnorm is increased. φnorm is the highest for UB-HiPIMS configuration. A surprising result is that the energy flux related to the B-DCMS discharge at 800 W is higher than the one measured for the UB-DCMS, at the same power. The enhanced plasma confinement for the balanced cathode promotes the heating of the target surface. The contribution of the IR photon flux emitted by the hot surface to the total energy flux is significantly increased. From this result, it appears that this contribution should be taken into account when discussing thin film final features...|$|E
40|$|THE {{apparatus}} to {{be described}} represents an attempt to develop a simple, cheap halothane vaporizer {{which could be used}} without modifi-cation of existing anaesthetic equipment and which would allow accurate but economical use of halo-thane. An earlier version of this vaporizer has been described (Cole, 1959) and the present model has already been referred to (Cole, 1960). The aim of the present paper is to describe the vaporizer and to record experiences of performance after ex-tensive use by the writer and by a number of other anaesthetists to whom vaporizers have been supplied. The vaporizer (fig. 1) consists of a metal assembly into which is screwed a 100 -ml bottle with a suitable washer intervening. The pro-jecting side tube is the <b>oxygen</b> <b>inlet.</b> Oxygen enters here, passes through ducts drilled in the metal and then through a vertical tube 8. 25 cm long to escape through a jet 1. 5 mm in diameter 2 cm above the bottom of the bottle. A safety valve which is spring loaded to open at 5 lb. /sq. in., is set in the metal cap and is connected with the oxygen duct so that if the pressure exceeds that figure only oxygen escapes. The oxygen and halothane mixture leaves the apparatus through a metal tube which terminates in a yoke block. Before use the apparatus is filled with halothane to a level just below the inlet pipe (about 22 ml), screwed into the cyclopropane yoke, and connec-ted to a supply of oxygen. It is now possible to pass a halothane and oxygen mixture through the cyclopropane flowmeter. The amounts of oxygen and halothane vapour flowing per minute for different readings of the flowmeter are shown in table I. The readings were made with the halothane maintained at a temperature of 18. 3 *C (65 "F) as this was felt to be the most useful temperature for calibration. In use the concentrated halothane vapour is metered by the cyclopropane flowmeter and i...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{contracts}} {{have been issued}} by the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to explore candidate technologies considered to be important for the Next Generation Launch Technology (NGLT) effort. One aspect of the NGLT effort is to explore the potential of incorporating non-toxic propellants for Reaction Control Subsystems (RCS). Contract NAS 8 - 01109 has been issued to Aerojet to develop a dual thrust Reaction Control Engine (RCE) that utilizes liquid oxygen and ethanol as the propellants. The dual thrust RCE incorporates a primary thrust level of 870 lbf, and a vernier thrust level of 10 - 30 lbf. Aerojet has designed and tested a workhorse LOX igniter to determine LOX/Ethanol ignition characteristics {{as part of a}} risk mitigation effort for the dual thrust RCE design. The objective of the ignition testing was to demonstrate successfid ignition from GOX to LOX, encompassing potential two-phase flow conditions. The workhorse igniter was designed to accommodate the full LOX design flowrate, as well as a reduced GOX flowrate. It was reasoned that the initial LOX flow through the igniter would flash to GOX due to the inherent heat stored in the hardware, causing a reduced oxygen flowrate because of a choked, or sonic, flow condition through the injection elements. As LOX flow continued, the inherent heat of the test hardware would be removed and the hardware would chill-in, with the injected oxygen flow transitioning from cold GOX through two-phase flow to subcooled LOX. Pressure and temperature instrumentation permitted oxygen state points to be determined, and gas-side igniter chamber thermocouples provided chamber thermal profile characteristics. The cold flow chamber pressure (P(sub c)) for each test was determined and coupled with the igniter chamber diameter (D(sub c)) to calculate the characteristic quench parameter (P(sub c) x D(sub c)), which was plotted as a function of core mixture ratio, MR(sub c). Ignition limits were determined over a broad range of valve inlet conditions, and ignition was demonstrated with <b>oxygen</b> <b>inlet</b> conditions that ranged from subcooled 173 R LOX to 480 R GQX. Once ignited at cold GOX conditions, combustion was continuous as the hardware chilled in and the core mixture ratio transitioned from values near 1. 0 to over 12. 5...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{discuss in}} this paper the {{potential}} of a method for NOx suppression from power plants based on microgas turbines. The method {{is based on the}} mild combustion concept but needs to be adapted to the actual operating parameters of the microturbine, thus resulting in an effective employment of the flue gas recirculation for diluting the <b>oxygen</b> in the <b>inlet</b> air. The results are first presented on a thermodynamic basis, and some cases are then analyzed with a computational fluid dynamics simulation. Both approaches suggest good perspectives for the nitric oxide control but also highlight some disadvantages in terms of increase in carbon species. _DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 2718232...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{directed}} at examining the effects of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), water/N 2 /CO 2 injections and oxygen enrichment on availability destroyed because of combustion in simple systems like those of constant pressure and constant volume. Higher cooled EGR fractions lead to higher availability destruction for reactant temperatures less than 2000 K. The availability destroyed for 40 % EGR at 300 K for constant pressure and constant volume combustion was 36 % and 33 %, respectively. Neglecting the chemical availability in the products, the equivalence ratio and reactant temperature that corresponded to the lowest availability destruction varied from 0. 8 to 1. 0 and 800 K to 1300 K, respectively, depending on the EGR fraction. The fraction of the reactant availability destroyed increased with {{the complexity of the}} fuel. The trends stayed the same for the different EGR fractions for the eight fuels that were analyzed. Higher injected water fractions lead to higher availability destruction for reactant temperatures less than 1000 K. The availability destroyed for a 40 % injected water fraction at 300 K for constant pressure combustion was 36 %. The product temperature ranged from 2300 K to 450 K at a reactant temperature of 300 K for injected fractions from 0 % to 90 %. For a 40 % injected fraction at a reactant temperature of 300 K, water injection and cooled EGR resulted in the greatest destruction of availability (about 36 %) with CO 2 injection leading to the least destruction (about 32 %). Constant volume combustion destroyed less availability compared to constant pressure combustion at a reactant pressure of 50 kPa. At a higher reactant pressure of 5000 kPa, constant pressure combustion destroyed less availability compared to constant volume combustion for reactant temperatures past 1000 K. Higher fractions of <b>oxygen</b> in the <b>inlet</b> lead to higher product temperatures that lead to lower availability destruction. For 40 % <b>oxygen</b> in <b>inlet,</b> the product temperature increased to 2900 K and the availability destroyed dropped to 25 % at a reactant temperature of 300 K for constant pressure combustion...|$|R
40|$|High Temperature Air Combustion is {{a recent}} {{development}} in the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels which promises high efficiencies. The principal feature of HiTAC is combustion at extremely low oxygen concentration levels with air preheating to high temperatures to maintain stable combustion. Experiments show that, under these conditions, the flame volume expands and the peak temperature decreases. In the present paper, these features of High Temperature Air Combustion are simulated in a 300 kW natural gas burner. Simulation was done by varying the operation condition such as oxidant temperature and the <b>inlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentration. The oxidant temperature was varied at 300 K, 600 K, 900 K, 1200 K and 1500 K. The oxygen concentration was varied at 5...|$|R
