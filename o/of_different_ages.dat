Beatrix Potter's 1908 The Tale of Jemima Puddle-duck created an enduringly popular bird heroine.

5|$|Majungasaurus, being {{known from}} many well-preserved {{specimens}} <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>ages,</b> is well studied {{in regards to}} its growth and development. Throughout ontogeny, the skull of Majungasaurus (more specifically, the jugal, postorbital, and quadratojugal) seems to have become taller and more robust; additionally, the skull bones became more fused and the eye sockets became proportionally smaller. This indicates a shift in dietary preferences between juveniles and adults.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} ceratopsians, {{especially}} Centrosaurus and its relatives, {{appear to have}} been gregarious, living in herds. This is suggested by bonebed finds with the remains of many individuals <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>ages.</b> Like modern migratory herds, they would have had a significant effect on their environment, as well as serving as a major food source for predators.|$|E

5|$|Limusaurus was {{originally}} {{described as a}} basal ceratosaurian, with both it and Elaphrosaurus being recovered as the most basal ceratosaurians in various phylogenetic analyses. However, subsequent research has placed it in the more derived group Abelisauroidea, specifically {{as a member of}} the Noasauridae. An analysis conducted in the study of multiple individuals <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>ages</b> found Limusaurus and Elaphrosaurus to group in the clade Elaphrosaurinae, within the family Nodosauridae. Nodosauridae was placed in a position outside Neoceratosauria, the group containing Ceratosaurus and Abelisauridae. The phylogenetics within Noasauridae, from the version of the analysis with separate specimens of Limusaurus, are shown below. It is notable that all the juvenile specimens grouped to the exclusion of adult specimens, showing that its anatomy changed significantly through growth.|$|E

5|$|The find of {{a herd of}} six Psittacosaurus {{individuals}} {{killed and}} buried by a volcanic mudflow indicates the presence {{of at least two}} age groups from two distinct clutches gathered together. This find has been taken as evidence for group fidelity and gregariousness extending beyond the nest; the earliest such evidence for any ceratopsian. Even very young psittacosaur teeth appear worn, indicating they chewed their own food and may have been precocial. Another juvenile-only cluster shows that specimens <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>ages</b> grouped together. These juveniles may have associated together as a close knit, mixed-age herd either for protection, to enhance their foraging, or as putative helpers at the parental nest. There is no evidence for parental care.|$|E

5|$|Studies of {{specimens}} of Pinacosaurus <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>ages</b> found that during ontogenetic development, the ribs of juvenile ankylosaurs fused with their vertebrae. The forelimbs strongly increased in robustness, while the hindlimbs {{did not become}} larger relative {{to the rest of}} the skeleton, further evidence that the arms bore most of the weight. In the cervical halfrings, the underlying bone band developed outgrowths connecting it with the underlying osteoderms, which simultaneously fused to each other. On the skull, the middle bone plates first ossified at the snout and the rear rim; gradually the ossification extended towards the middle regions. On the rest of the body, the ossification process progressed from the neck onwards in the direction of the tail. Young ankylosaurs are commonly found together but adults are found separate, suggesting they were solitary.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} noted traits of Cabernet Sauvignon is its {{affinity}} for oak, either during fermentation or in barrel aging. In addition to having a softening effect on the grape's naturally high tannins, the unique wood flavors of vanilla and spice complement the natural grape flavors of blackcurrant and tobacco. The particular success of Cabernet-based Bordeaux blends in the 225 liter (59 gallon) barrique were a significant influence in making that barrel size one {{of the most}} popular worldwide. In winemaking, the decision for the degree of oak influence (as well as which type of oak) will have a strong impact on the resulting wine. American oak, particularly from new barrels, imparts stronger oak flavors that are less subtle than those imparted by French oak. Even within the American oak family, the location of the oak source also plays a role with oak from the state of Oregon having more pronounced influence on Cabernet Sauvignon than oak from Missouri, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Winemakers often use a variety of oak barrels from different locations and <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>ages</b> and blend the wine as if they are blending different grape varieties.|$|E

The {{results show that the}} aged people prefer recreation in woodland; the middle-aged prefer recreation in water area; the youth and children prefer recreation in grassland. Comparing with other time periods, the aged, middle-aged, youth, and children respectively prefer to conduct their ecological leisure activities from 7 am to 9 am, from 7 pm to 9 pm, from 1 pm to 3 pm, and from 10 am to 12 am separately...|$|R
