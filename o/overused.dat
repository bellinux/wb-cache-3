40|$|Objectives: Preventive {{approaches}} for <b>overuse</b> injuries in sports {{will be more}} successful when synchronised with athletes' and coaches' beliefs. We interviewed athletes and coaches {{in order to better}} characterize their beliefs about the definition of an <b>overuse</b> injury, as well as the intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors that underlie <b>overuse</b> injuries. Design: Qualitative study using in-depth interviews in athletes and coaches of different sports. Methods: Athletes who had experienced <b>overuse</b> injuries and coaches who trained athletes who had sustained <b>overuse</b> injuries from sports clubs were invited to participate through interview. We explored each participant's individual definition of an <b>overuse</b> injury and the beliefs concerning the intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors concerning <b>overuse</b> injuries were explored. Results: After nine athletes and nine coaches, sample size saturation was confirmed. Athletes and coaches integrate somatic as well as psychological and sociological factors into the definition of and risk factors for <b>overuse</b> injuries. Intrinsic factors for an <b>overuse</b> injury were related to physical factors, technique, psychological factors and heredity. The extrinsic factors were related to situational, social and training factors, as well as the individual coach. Conclusions: Athletes and coaches have a holistic view on the definition of <b>overuse</b> injuries, and the intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors for <b>overuse</b> injuries. If preventive {{approaches for}} <b>overuse</b> injuries are developed and implemented, they should incorporate physical factors, as well as incorporate psychological and social factors. Based on the input of coaches and athletes, the latter are important risk factors for <b>overuse</b> injuries. (C) 2011 Sports Medicine Australia. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Though {{mountain}} bikers are at significant risk for <b>overuse</b> injury, there is minimal quality research describing this relationship. Single-speed mountain biking, {{in which participants}} pedal a bike with only a single gear, may place riders at even greater risk for <b>overuse</b> problems due to the disproportionate physical effort associated {{with this type of}} riding. The focus {{of this study was to}} provide additional perspective on <b>overuse</b> injuries sustained by {{mountain bikers}} and to determine if single-speed mountain biking places participants at greater risk for <b>overuse</b> conditions. Four hundred and four (404) mountain bikers were surveyed concerning <b>overuse</b> injuries sustained during the previous year. Findings indicate that 63 % of respondents reported an <b>overuse</b> injury affecting at least one area with the most commonly reported areas being the lumbar spine, knees, hand/wrist, and cervical spine. Individuals riding single-speed mountain bikes did not have a higher incidence of <b>overuse</b> injuries than riders of multiple-geared bikes. However, respondents who split time between riding single-speed and multiple-geared bikes were significantly more likely to report an <b>overuse</b> syndrome than those only riding single-speed or multiple-geared bikes (p = 0. 0104). This group of riders may be at greater risk for <b>overuse</b> injury due to excessive fatigue and poor biomechanics...|$|R

5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} nature {{is indicated by}} the use of the expression ecosystem services to highlight the market relevance of an increasingly scarce natural world that can no longer be regarded as both unlimited and free. In general, as a commodity or service becomes more scarce the price increases and this acts as a restraint that encourages frugality, technical innovation and alternative products. However, this only applies when the product or service falls within the market system. As ecosystem services are generally treated as economic externalities they are unpriced and therefore <b>overused</b> and degraded, a situation sometimes referred to as the Tragedy of the Commons.|$|E
40|$|<b>Overuse,</b> {{which is}} defined as the {{provision}} of medical services that are more likely to cause harm than good, is a pervasive problem. Direct measurement of <b>overuse</b> through documentation of delivery of inappropriate services is challenging given the difficulty of defining appropriate care for patients with individual preferences and needs; <b>overuse</b> can also be measured indirectly through examination of unwarranted geographical variations in prevalence of procedures and care intensity. Despite the challenges, the high prevalence of <b>overuse</b> is well documented in high-income countries across a wide range of services and is increasingly recognised in low-income countries. <b>Overuse</b> of unneeded services can harm patients physically and psychologically, and can harm health systems by wasting resources and deflecting investments in both public health and social spending, which is known to contribute to health. Although harms from <b>overuse</b> have not been well quantified and trends have not been well described, <b>overuse</b> is likely to be increasing worldwide...|$|R

5|$|The player's primary {{weapon is}} a ghostly {{version of the}} Soul Reaver sword, {{referred}} to as the wraith-blade. The wraith-blade is symbiotically bound to Raziel, and can be summoned or dismissed {{at any time in the}} material world, but, if <b>overused,</b> the sword can turn against Raziel, siphoning his health. Other weapons include claws, swords and spears. As the game progresses, the player encounters magical forges which imbue the wraith-blade with elemental powers associated with darkness, light, air, and fire. These enhancements have various uses, but are only available in the material realm. If Raziel shifts, he loses his active elemental imbuement, and must re-forge the blade at locations scattered throughout the game world.|$|E

In fact, IGN felt that Donkey Kong 64 was not as pretty as Banjo-Kazooie, especially in its water and backgrounds, though it still ranked among the console's prettiest games. The setting is barren and nondescript at first, and only later introduces lighting effects and richer textures. IGN hoped for more from Rare, and while its reviewer praised the game's particle effects (e.g., in the desert wind), he considered the game's dynamic lighting <b>overused.</b> N64 Magazine said that the enhanced effects were most often used for decoration, though they also played some role in puzzles based on illuminating paths. Reviewers noted graphical difficulties even with the extra memory, such as frame rate slowdowns and distant features not appearing in any detail, though overall they considered the added graphical flourishes commendable. GameSpot also saw a lack of variety in the game's environment.|$|E
5|$|Guard {{units were}} {{generally}} neglected when the United States Air Force was created. Despite {{the introduction of}} jet fighters, the Guard units were left with generally <b>overused</b> World War II propeller aircraft, and had few funds for training. As the Cold War intensified, the Air Force looked to the Guard to fill United States-based interception missions and started overhauling their organization. Although the Massachusetts Air National Guard wasn't federalized for the Korean War, many airmen volunteered for active duty and flew in Korea. On 1 November 1950, the 67th Fighter Wing was inactivated and replaced by the 102d Fighter Wing, including just the 101st and 131st squadrons and their associated support units, {{and at some point}} before 1961 the wing was renamed a Tactical Fighter Wing. Additionally, the wing kept the 567th, and the 1801st. The squadrons were issued F-84B Thunderjets, but these were recalled and replaced by F-51 Mustangs which were flown until 1954 when the F-94 Starfire replaced the Mustangs. In 1952 the 253rd Combat Communications Group was activated and added to the 102d. In 1958 the Wing converted to the F-86H Sabre.|$|E
40|$|<b>Overuse</b> {{injuries}} are {{a serious problem}} in junior tennis. Gaining insight in age-specific risk factors can contribute to prevention. The developmental cognitive processes that take place during adolescence make talented players more inclined to take risks. This {{may be even more}} pronounced in the high performance culture in which they move. Therefore, this study focuses on the relationship between risk-taking and <b>overuse</b> injuries in talented tennis players. Seventy-three talented tennis players (45 boys and 28 girls, age 11 - 14 years) were monitored for 32 weeks, using the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Centre Questionnaire on Health Problems. Risk-taking was measured {{at the start of the}} season with the Iowa Gambling Task. Linear regression analyses were executed to predict (a) <b>overuse</b> injuries, (b) time loss <b>overuse</b> injuries and (c) <b>overuse</b> severity, by risk-taking, exposure time, and injury history. In boys, risk-taking contributed significantly to time loss <b>overuse</b> injuries [F(1, 39) = 7. 764, P = 0. 008, R- 2 = 0. 15] and to <b>overuse</b> severity [F(1, 39) = 5. 683, P = 0. 022, with an R- 2 of 0. 13] In girls, time loss <b>overuse</b> injuries [F(1, 23) = 6. 889, P = 0. 018, R- 2 = 0. 20] and <b>overuse</b> severity [F(1, 23) = 7. 287, P = 0. 013, R- 2 = 0. 24] were predicted by exposure time.

40|$|This study's {{objective}} was to collect items from experienced sports physicians, relating to the presence and severity of <b>overuse</b> wrist injuries in young athletes, for developing a measurement instrument for signals of <b>overuse</b> wrist injury. Seven Dutch elite sports physicians involved in guidance and treatment of young athletes in wrist-loading sports (gymnastics, tennis, judo, field hockey, volleyball and rowing) participated in a focus group. They discussed signals and limitations related to <b>overuse</b> wrist injuries in young athletes. Data were coded and categorised into signals and limitations with subcategories, using an inductive approach. Of the resulting 61 signals and limitations in nineteen (sub) categories, 20 were considered important, forming a comprehensive item set for identifying <b>overuse</b> wrist injury in young athletes. Signals such as pain, "click", crepitations, swelling and limited range of motion were marked useful for early identification of <b>overuse</b> wrist injury. Limitations in movement and performance were considered indicative of severe <b>overuse</b> injury but less relevant for initial injury identification. The focus group provided 17 important signals and 3 important limitations indicative of <b>overuse</b> wrist injury. These {{provide the basis for}} a valid measurement instrument for identifying <b>overuse</b> wrist injury in young athletes, with equal emphasis on pain and on other symptom...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{migraine}} {{patients are}} at risk of developing a medication <b>overuse.</b> Brain functional studies in these patients have demonstrated an orbitofrontal hypometabolism, persistent after <b>overuse</b> cessation. Orbitofrontal dysfunction is also present in addiction and thus could predispose migraineurs to medication <b>overuse.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate if orbitofrontal dysfunction can be demonstrated in patients with chronic migraine and medication <b>overuse</b> by performing a systematic neuropsychological evaluation focused on tests that assess frontal lobe function. Second, to establish whether it is related to the outcome of these patients. We prospectively studied 42 chronic migraine patients with medication <b>overuse,</b> 42 episodic migraineurs and 41 controls on a battery of neuropsychological tasks evaluating the orbitofrontal and dorsolateral functioning. Depression, anxiety, and personality traits were also assessed. Chronic migraineurs with medication <b>overuse</b> showed a significant impairment in orbitofrontal task performance and higher depression scores as compared to episodic migraineurs and controls. Dorsolateral dysfunction was present in both groups of migraneurs, who also had higher rates of anxiety as compared to controls. After 1  year of follow-up, migraine patient’s outcome was classified according to their medication <b>overuse</b> status. A negative outcome that included persistent or new-onset medication <b>overuse</b> was present in 34 % of migraineurs and was associated with baseline poor orbitofrontal task performance, and with mild dorsolateral dysfunction, higher rates of depression, anxiety and neuroticism-anxiety traits. Formal education and years with migraine did not influence outcome. Orbitofrontal dysfunction is present in patients with chronic migraine and medication <b>overuse,</b> and associates with a poor outcome at 1  year of follow-up. Neuropsychological evaluation in migraine may help to detect patients prone to <b>overuse</b> so that appropriate therapeutic attitudes can be taken...|$|R

Public school buildings acted as shelters, and were for refuge only, meaning they did not provide food, cots, blankets, medications or other comfort items. Roughly one-third of Oahu's population participated in the evacuation, though many others went {{to the house of}} a family member or friend for shelter. The execution of the evacuations went well, beginning with the vulnerable coastal area.

40|$|When {{analysing}} {{the legitimacy}} of the welfare state, perceptions of the <b>overuse</b> and underuse of welfare are of great importance. Previous literature suggests that many people perceive <b>overuse</b> (misuse or fraud), and there is evidence that people also perceive underuse (non-take-up) of welfare benefits. Perceptions of <b>overuse</b> have therefore been called ‘the Achilles’ heel of welfare state legitimacy'. We analyse data from the European Social Survey for 25 countries and investigate the occurrence and the individual and contextual determinants of <b>overuse</b> and underuse perceptions. We find that both <b>overuse</b> and underuse perceptions are prevalent in all European countries. However, whereas <b>overuse</b> perceptions are more related to ideology, collective images of welfare recipients and selective welfare regimes, underuse perceptions are more shaped by self-interest and the levels of unemployment and social spending in a country. Instead of one Achilles' heel, welfare state legitimacy seems to have two weak spots. Key words: Benefit abuse, European Social Survey, non-take-up, welfare attitudes, welfare state...|$|R
40|$|Background: Antibiotics misuse is {{currently}} {{one of the}} major public health issues worldwide. This misuse can lead to the development of bacterial resistance, increasing the burden of chronic diseases, rising costs of health services, and the development of side effects.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the frequency of}} <b>overuse</b> injuries in climbing among the general climbers, to {{investigate the}} risk factors for <b>overuse</b> injuries and {{to find the most}} frequent injury locations of the body. METHOD: 207 climbers of all ages and levels where asked to fill out a questionnaire. The questionnaire focused on exposure to climbing in number of climbing years, level and training frequency. Further the climbers were asked if they did any other sports, if they had sustained any <b>overuse</b> injury and the characteristics of the different <b>overuse</b> syndromes. Statistical analysis included simple cross tabulations and multiple logistic regressions. RESULT: 47 % of the climbers have sustained one or more <b>overuse</b> injuries. Most of the injuries are located to the fingers (45 %). 22 % of the injuries are located in the elbow and 16 % in the shoulder. <b>Overuse</b> injuries in the upper extremities are responsible for a total of 94 % of the <b>overuse</b> injuries due to climbing.

5|$|Sussex {{began their}} run-chase well; Barclay and Gehan Mendis scored 93 runs together, {{surviving}} a spell of attacking fast bowling from Garner and Dredge early on. Mendis had broken his thumb {{shortly before the}} final, and in the third over, it was fractured again, but he continued to bat. When Somerset did make a breakthrough, after 24 overs, they collected four wickets for the addition of seventeen runs. Mendis was the first man out, caught by Marks off the bowling of Graham Burgess, followed by Barclay who was caught hooking a delivery from Botham. Miandad was dismissed without scoring, and shortly thereafter, Imran was caught and bowled by Botham for three. Rose then chose to replace his bowlers, and against the less incisive bowling of Keith Jennings and Burgess, Parker and Paul Phillipson were able to establish a 97-run partnership, which brought Sussex to within five runs of their winning target, before Phillipson was by caught by the wicket-keeper, Derek Taylor off the bowling of Dredge. Woodcock thought that Botham in particular bowled too short against Phillipson, who he suggested would have been susceptible to a yorker. In Wisden, Eric Hill opined that Botham's short-pitched bowling, which was a feature of his play late in the season, was due to him being <b>overused</b> by England and Somerset through the year. Parker scored the winning runs to secure a five-wicket victory for Sussex with 41 deliveries remaining.|$|E

We focused on popular wrist-loading youth sports-gymnastics, tennis, field hockey, volleyball, judo and rowing. Systematic review. We conducted a literature search on athletes aged < 18  years performing wrist-loading focus sports. Prevalence, incidence and/or risk factor ORs for <b>overuse</b> wrist injuries were extracted directly or calculated from reported data. The search identified six studies on prevalence, five on incidence, and one on risk factors. Prevalence rates were 32 - 73 % for wrist pain and 10 - 28 % for <b>overuse</b> wrist injury. Incidence rates were 7 - 9 % for wrist pain and 0. 02 - 26 % for <b>overuse</b> wrist injury. The three criteria associated with wrist pain were (with OR) : age of 10 - 14  years (11. 5), training intensity (1. 2), and earlier onset of gymnastics training (1. 97). Prevalence and incidence of <b>overuse</b> wrist injuries was high in multiple studies of gymnasts, and largely unknown in other wrist-loading focus sports.
