30|$|IPCC in {{its fifth}} {{assessment}} report {{have used a}} new set of scenarios called Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) (Vuuren, et al. 2011, Moss, et al. 2010) based on a set of scenarios of anthropogenic forcings which are used for the new climate model simulations carried out under the framework of the CMIP 5. RCPs have been developed using Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) that typically include economic, demographic, energy and simple climate components. Before AR 5, IPCC has been using climate change scenario based <b>on</b> <b>Special</b> <b>Report</b> on Emission Scenarios (SRES) published in 2000 (IPCC Working Group III 2000). In contrast to the AR 4, the climate change from the RCP scenarios in the AR 5 is framed as a combination of adaptation and mitigation (IPCC 2013). They produce a range of responses from ongoing warming, to approximately stabilize forcing, to a stringent mitigation scenario that stabilizes and then slowly reduces the RF after mid- 21 st century. Four RCPs have been used in AR 5 to represent future scenarios. They are RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6 and RCP 8.5. In all RCPs, atmospheric CO 2 concentrations are higher in 2100 relative to present day {{as a result of a}} further increase of cumulative emissions of CO 2 to the atmosphere during the 21 st century. RCP 2.6 (van Vuuren et al. 2006; van Vuuren et al. 2007) is a low emission scenario where Radiative forcing (RF) reaches 3.1  W/m 2 before it returns to 2.6  W/m 2 by 2100; RCP 4.5 (Smith and Wigley 2006; Clarke et al. 2007; Wise et al. 2009) is an intermediate emission scenario where RF stabilizes shortly after year 2100 to 4.5  W/m 2; RCP 6 (Fujino et al. 2006; Hijioka et al. 2008) is also an intermediate emission scenario in which RF stabilizes after 2100 to 6  W/m 2. RCP 8.5 (Riahi et al. 2007; Rao and Riahi 2006) is a high emission scenario which has rising RF leading to 8.5  W/m 2 by 2100.|$|E

The {{research was}} conducted at the hydraulic laboratory of KULeuven, Belgium and the Hydrology and Water resources division of the Civil Engineering Department, Makerere University Kampala, Uganda. This research {{was linked to the}} FRIEND/Nile research activities being condcuted by the River Nile basin riparian country. The author has been a team member. The Ugandan Ministry of Water and Environment provided the external supports including data. Climate is indubitably a key driver of change determining different characteristics and distributions of natural and managed systems. Change in climate is hypothesized to be a result of mainly increase in greenhouse gases concentrations in the atmosphere and has been widely documented in literatures as involving increase in global temperature. Human activities, primarily burning of fossil fuels andclearing of forests are also widely documented to have greatly intensified thenatural greenhouse effect resulting into an enhancement of global warming. Dueto global warming, several of the constituents of the components of the climatesystem, including hydrological cycle, will be severely perturbed. Scientistsaround the globe are using climate models such as Global Climate Models (GCMs) to facilitate the understanding of the changes in the climate system withoptimistic attempts to project future climate based on, for example,socioeconomic scenarios. Corroborated studies have conspicuously shown thatchange in climate is a real threat to a global society and its environment. Thethreat is mainly extremes of climate such as severe droughts and prolonged orintense wet spells resulting into floods, among others, which have very strongnegative impacts on both natural and managed systems. Change inclimate may potentially alter the frequency, quantity, location and duration ofhydrological regimes. Changed hydrological extremes will have significantimplications on the planning and design of hydraulic structures and generalcharacteristics of water resources such as quantities and qualities. Thechanges could aggravate periodic and cyclic shortfalls of water supply inaddition to other factors such as landuse malpractices. Increasingaccumulation and availability of climate related information such as scientificpublications and more especially the data for future possible climate statesobtained through application of GCMs and past climate are rapidly driving theclimate change impacts studies to the next level. The demand for hydrologicalimplications of climate change is one big area of concern because of thesignificant role hydrology plays in the sustainability of human and ecologicallives. The main objective of this study was thus to investigate the possibleimpacts of climate change on the hydrological extremes and water resources inthe upper Nile basin, Lake Victoria catchments, with a yawning focus on thehydrological consequences for the River Katonga and River Ruizi catchmentresponses. Investigation oftrends in the historical hydrometeorological records formed the first objectiveof this study. Trend analysis results do not only provide information on thegeneral direction of observed change but also unravel significant changes thathave occurred over and above the expected natural climate variability and may linkthem to past consequences. Sincethe effects of climate change are unleashedmore through the occurrence of extremes, the presence of a significant lineartrend in a long term climate record of extremes may provide evidence of asignificant shift from the natural trend to that which is enhanced by, forexample, anthropogenic forcing. Analysis of long term records of extremes forrainfall, temperature and streamflows from selected stations within the studyarea were considered in this study. The findings indicated that these extremesare generally experiencing a positive trend. Albeit positive trend wasgenerally demonstrated in the extremes for the selected variables, the presenceof significant linear trend was only manifested in the extremes of the data forthe stations located in the northern and eastern parts of the Lake Victoriabasin. This may suggest that the monotony in the linear trend is probably anindicator of the sensitivity of the regions extremes to climate change due topossible external enhancement of the natural climate agitation. The latter hasimplications for flood risks if the trend is maintained. Furthermore, thehigher significant anomalies for the 1990 s as compared to that of the 1960 s maysuggest a more intense enhancement of the change in the natural variability inthe recent climate. Correlation between change in the extremes of rainfall andthat of the minimum temperature was demonstrated to be stronger compared toother variables. This may suggest that in the absence of extreme rainfall data,minimum temperature may be a good indicator of the rainfall extremes. The credibilityof the GCMs in representing the current and past climate needs to be assessedbefore the GCM data are employed to aid assessment of hydrological impacts ofclimate change. Thus, the second objective {{of this study was to}} test thereliability of the GCMs based on their simulation runs for the 20 th century(present day climate). The present day simulations were evaluated against theobserved hydrometeorological records using mainly statistical metrics. Thefindings showed that several GCMs are quite implausible with respect tosimulation of the climate of the Lake Victoria basin and more tasks still lieahead for the climate modelers. However, the evaluation results for some of theGCMs provided motivation for their employment in the impact assessment for theregion. Change inhydrological regimes due to projected change in climate necessitates comparingthe future hydrological time series with that of the current or observedclimate. GCMs directly provide future hydrological time series such as rainfalland temperature based <b>on</b> <b>Special</b> <b>Report</b> on Emission Scenarios (SRES) of theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Nevertheless, the scales in theGCM experimental runs still need to be similar with the one needed for thestudy of local hydrology if a meaningful comparison is being sought. Conventionapproach to match the scales in GCMs with that of the hydrology at catchmentlevel is through what is termed downscaling. The third objective of the studywas to formulate a methodology for the improvement of the perturbation approachfor downscaling rainfall. The innovated technique ensures the extraction ofclimate change signals at larger scale and transferring them to local scale iscarried out while accounting for the climate change signals of the wet spellsin the time series. The results demonstrated the plausibility of the technique. The downscaledhydrometeorological variables enabled the investigation of climate changeimpacts on rainfall in the study area. The fourth objective was to analyzechange in rainfall extremes because of their apparent manifestation in the faceof climate change. Extremes from selected stations across the study area wereconsidered and comparison was done based mainly on extreme value analysis. Thefindings showed that the magnitude of rainfall extremes are projected to bealtered significantly with the extremes for the eastern part of the LakeVictoria basin increasing higher than those for the western part. The rainfallextremes for the south and the southwestern parts of the basin are projected todecrease. Analysis of the possible change in rainfallIntensity-duration-frequency (IDF) relationships was also carried out usingextreme value technique. The results showed that change in the IDF would havesignificant implications for hydraulic design practices and other relatedengineering applications. The otherobjective was to carry out a rigorous analysis of the possible hydrologicalresponses of the River Katonga and Ruizi catchments, given possible futureclimate states, based on rainfall-runoff model simulations. The rainfall-runoffmodel was driven by the downscaled variables from a suit of selected GCM runsunder three different SRES scenarios code-named A 1, A 1 B and B 1 of the IPCC andfor two different future periods, 2050 s and 2090 s. Since the focus of the studywas centered on high flows, considerable efforts were devoted to ensure thatthe development of the rainfall-runoff model take into account good fits withthe high flow peaks during calibration and validation stages. Impacts ofclimate change on the streamflows from the two catchments were executed bycomparing the future streamflows with that of the present day (control) streamflows. The results showed that the hydrological response of therespective catchment is likely to underscore the integrity of the water balanceof the catchments. The water balance of each of the two catchments is projectedto experience a significant deficit and may severely affect the hydrologicdemands from the two catchments in addition to other constraints. Furthermore,the flood frequency is projected to be affected and this has implications onthe engineering practices and other water resources planning involving floodfrequency estimations. In conclusive remarks, assessment of the possibleimpacts of climate change on the hydrological extremes and water resources ofthe upper Nile basin was carried out based on a suit of GCM runs, which werealso used for AR 4 IPCC. This should set the stage for the subsequent relevantresearch tasks that seek to address hydrological impacts of climate change forthe region. Water managers in the catchments are advised to take a step thatmay lead to the revision of the current relevant hydraulic design guidelines inorder to take into account the future hydrologic risks imposed by change inclimate. In addition, a collaborative effort is needed across relevant researchdisciplines and the responsible water agencies in the region for a moreholistic and integrated research syntheses that can, unanimously, translateinto a regional strategy and policy for adaptation to climate change. It shouldbe noted also that a number of uncertainty sources are known and constitute oneof the most setbacks in climate change impacts assessment, which cannot beshirked.
