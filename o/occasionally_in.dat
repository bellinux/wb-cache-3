5|$|Bodyline {{continued}} to be bowled <b>occasionally</b> <b>in</b> the 1933 English season—most notably by Nottinghamshire, who had Carr, Voce and Larwood in their team.

5|$|Béla {{appointed}} his son-in-law, Rostislav Mikhailovich Ban of Macsó (Mačva, Serbia) in 1254. Rostislav's {{task was}} the creation of a buffer zone along the southern borders. He occupied Bosnia already in the year of his appointment and forced Tzar Michael Asen I of Bulgaria to cede Belgrade and Barancs (Braničevo, Serbia) in 1255.

5|$|Chinese, Indian and Comorian {{minorities}} {{are present in}} Madagascar, {{as well as a}} small European (primarily French) populace. Emigration in the late 20th century has reduced these minority populations, <b>occasionally</b> <b>in</b> abrupt waves, such as the exodus of Comorans in 1976, following anti-Comoran riots in Mahajanga. By comparison, there has been no significant emigration of Malagasy peoples. The number of Europeans has declined since independence, reduced from 68,430 in 1958 to 17,000 three decades later. There were an estimated 25,000Comorans, 18,000Indians, and 9,000Chinese living in Madagascar in the mid-1980s.|$|E

In Indonesian cuisine, especially in Indonesian gulés (curries), cubeb is frequently used.|$|E
5|$|Elementary {{education}} was widely available {{throughout most of}} the Byzantine Empire's existence, in towns and <b>occasionally</b> <b>in</b> the countryside. This, in turn, ensured that literacy was much more widespread than in Western Europe, at least until the twelfth century. Secondary {{education was}} confined to the larger cities while higher education was the exclusive provenance of Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|In earlier times, when large {{populations of}} {{springbok}} roamed the Kalahari desert and Karoo, millions of migrating springbok formed herds hundreds of kilometres long {{that could take}} several days to pass a town. These mass treks, known as trekbokken in Afrikaans, took place during long periods of drought. Herds could efficiently retrace their paths to their territories after long migrations. Trekbokken is still observed <b>occasionally</b> <b>in</b> Botswana, though on a much smaller scale than earlier.|$|E

5|$|Red maple's rapid growth, ease of transplanting, {{attractive}} form, {{and value}} for wildlife (in the eastern US) {{has made it}} one of the most extensively planted trees. In parts of the Pacific Northwest, it is one of the most common introduced trees. Its popularity in cultivation stems from its vigorous habit, its attractive and early red flowers, and most importantly, its flaming red fall foliage. The tree was introduced into the United Kingdom in 1656 and shortly thereafter entered cultivation. There it is frequently found in many parks and gardens, as well as <b>occasionally</b> <b>in</b> churchyards.|$|E
5|$|The Itchy & Scratchy Show {{is a show}} {{within a}} show that appears <b>occasionally</b> <b>in</b> episodes of The Simpsons.

Itchy & Scratchy airs as a segment on The Krusty the Clown Show, and also aired on its brief replacements, Sideshow Bob's Cavalcade of Whimsy and Gabbo.|$|E
5|$|The {{mushroom}} {{grows in}} grassland habitats, especially wetter areas. But unlike P.cubensis, the fungus does not grow directly on dung; rather, it is a saprobic species that feeds off decaying grass roots. It is widely {{distributed in the}} temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe, and has been reported <b>occasionally</b> <b>in</b> temperate areas of the Southern Hemisphere as well. The earliest reliable history of P.semilanceata intoxication dates back to 1799 in London, and in the 1960s the mushroom was the first European species confirmed to contain psilocybin.|$|E

5|$|The {{species is}} common in spruce-fir and spruce-moorland forests and in spruce forests and plantations. Together with spruces, the fungus is also common in {{different}} European beech and oak-European hornbeam forests, {{but also on the}} forest edges, on clearings and in clearcut meadows and even on juniper heathers and in parkland. There are scarcely any habitats where the spruce is common, while the fungus is not found there. The fungus is very common in young spruce forests that are 10 to 20 years old, where it occurs on forest path edges <b>occasionally</b> <b>in</b> masses.|$|E
5|$|The striped honeyeater {{has most}} often been {{observed}} singly or in twos, and <b>occasionally</b> <b>in</b> small flocks. When not breeding {{it has been}} recorded feeding in loose mobile groups, drinking in mixed groups with miners, and travelling in small groups. It engages in {{a high level of}} social activity, including perching closely and allopreening, and when feeding in groups chasing, calling and scolding. The non-breeding striped honeyeater is vocal, calling while feeding and perching, though only occasionally calling in flight. It has been recorded engaged in a display of wing raising and calling, and performing duets and call-and-response song.|$|E
5|$|Xenon {{is used in}} {{light-emitting}} devices called xenon flash lamps, used in photographic {{flashes and}} stroboscopic lamps; to excite the active medium in lasers which then generate coherent light; and, <b>occasionally,</b> <b>in</b> bactericidal lamps. The first solid-state laser, invented in 1960, was pumped by a xenon flash lamp, and lasers used to power inertial confinement fusion are also pumped by xenon flash lamps.|$|E
