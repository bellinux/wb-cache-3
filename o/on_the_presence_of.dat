5|$|Although {{paleontology}} became established around 1800, earlier thinkers {{had noticed}} {{aspects of the}} fossil record. The ancient Greek philosopher Xenophanes (570–480 BC) concluded from fossil sea shells that some areas of land were once under water. During the Middle Ages the Persian naturalist Ibn Sina, known as Avicenna in Europe, discussed fossils and proposed a theory of petrifying fluids on which Albert of Saxony elaborated in the 14th century. The Chinese naturalist Shen Kuo (1031–1095) proposed a theory of climate change based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> petrified bamboo in regions that in his time were too dry for bamboo.|$|E
5|$|Biochrons for aetosaur genera {{have been}} {{developed}} for dating strata in the Chinle Group of the southwestern United States. Up to 13 genera of aetosaurs are known from the Chinle Group, with most occurring in multiple localities and over short time spans. In 1996, paleontologists Spencer G. Lucas and Andrew B. Heckert recognized five biochrons based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> aetosaurs throughout the Chinle Group. The number of biochrons grew to 11 in a 2007 study by Heckert and Lucas along with Adrian P. Hunt and Justin A. Spielmann. These biochrons occurred from the Otischalkian LVF to the Apachean LVF and included genera such as Longosuchus, Tecovasuchus, and Typothorax.|$|E

5|$|Conservation {{efforts for}} Hydnellum are {{hindered}} {{by the fact}} that some species are difficult to discriminate in the field, making it hard to determine an appropriate conservation status. Techniques based on species-specific PCR primers and DNA extraction from soil have been developed to detect the mycelia of various Hydnellum species without having to rely <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> fruitbodies, which may help conservation efforts as well as improve understanding of below-ground ecology. Similar techniques have been used to show that, in the case of H.aurantiacum and H.caeruleum, the fungus can persist below the ground for at least four years without producing fruitbodies.|$|E

5|$|Periyar {{claimed that}} Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada {{came from the}} same mother {{language}} of Old Tamil. He explained that the Tamil language is called by four different names since it is spoken in four different Dravidian states. Nevertheless, current understanding of Dravidian languages contains statements contradicting such claims. For example, the currently known classification of Dravidian languages provides the following distinct classes: Southern (including Tamil–Kannada (Malayalam) and Tulu); Central (including Telugu–Kui and Kolami–Parji); and, Northern (including Kurukh–Malto and Brahui). Additionally, statements <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> evidence for linking Dravidian languages and Indo-European languages are available.|$|E
5|$|The Cambridge Water Company were {{a company}} {{responsible}} for providing potable water to the inhabitants of Cambridge and the surrounding areas. In 1976, they purchased a borehole outside Sawston to deal with rising demand. In 1980, a European Directive was issued requiring nations of the European Community to establish standards <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> perchloroethene (PCE) in water, which the United Kingdom did in 1982.

5|$|The {{origins of}} Ma-on were {{from an area}} of {{convection}} that meandered near Wake Island on July 9. The disturbance slowly consolidated and developed a low-level circulation. Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> low wind shear and generally favorable environmental conditions, tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated that the system would develop into a tropical cyclone. Early on July 11, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, and {{a few hours later}} the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) reported the formation of a tropical depression about halfway between Wake Island and the Northern Marianas Islands. The JTWC followed suit and initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 08W.|$|E

5|$|Despite his successes, al-Mu'tadid's reign was {{ultimately}} {{too short to}} effect a lasting reversal of the Caliphate's fortunes, and the revival that he spearheaded was too dependent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> capable personalities {{at the helm of}} the state. The brief reign of his less able son and heir, al-Muktafi, still saw some major gains, notably the annexation of the Tulunid domains, but his later successors lacked his energy, and new enemies appeared in the form of the Qarmatians. In addition, the factionalism within the bureaucracy, that had become apparent during the later years of al-Mu'tadid's reign, would debilitate the Abbasid government for decades to come, eventually leading to the subjugation of the Caliphate to a series of military strongmen and culminating in the conquest of Baghdad by the Buyids in 946.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 it was {{proposed}} that large theropods like Tyrannosaurus had teeth covered in lips like modern day lizards, {{rather than having}} bare teeth like crocodiles. This was based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> enamel, which according to this theory, may have to remain hydrated, an issue not faced by aquatic species like crocodilians or toothless species like birds, which have lipless mouths and toothless beaks. Based on comparisons of bone texture of Daspletosaurus with crocodilians, a 2017 theory suggests that Tyrannosaurus and other tyrannosaurids {{may not have had}} lips at all and instead had large, flat scales that left no room for lips. The skull of Daspletosaurus also suggests that tyrannosaurids including Tyrannosaurus had integumentary sensory organs similar to crocodilians likely used in touch, temperature readings, prey detection and precise control of jaw movements.|$|E
5|$|Many eusauropods, {{including}} Dinheirosaurus {{have been}} found in the Late Jurassic of Europe. The sauropods are from {{around the base of the}} Tithonian as based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> Anchispirocyclina lusitanica. One sauropod, a diplodocid currently based on an unnamed specimen including vertebrae and some bones, is clearly different from Dinheirosaurus and Losillasaurus, confirming the presence of a least two and possibly more diplodocids in the Late Jurassic of Spain and Portugal. This is unique in the variety of diplodocoids in all Europe, with the only other genera possibly non-diplodocoid (Cetiosauriscus), or classified in Rebbachisauridae. This suggests that the biogeography of primitive sauropods is incomplete, with possible primitive eusauropods and diplodocids surviving in the Late Jurassic, potentially until the Berriasian.|$|E

5|$|Many prokaryotic {{genes are}} {{organized}} into operons, with multiple protein-coding sequences that are transcribed as a unit. The genes in an operon are transcribed {{as a continuous}} messenger RNA, {{referred to as a}} polycistronic mRNA. The term cistron in this context is equivalent to gene. The transcription of an operon’s mRNA is often controlled by a repressor that can occur in an active or inactive state depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> certain specific metabolites. When active, the repressor binds to a DNA sequence {{at the beginning of the}} operon, called the operator region, and represses transcription of the operon; when the repressor is inactive transcription of the operon can occur (see e.g. Lac operon). The products of operon genes typically have related functions and are involved in the same regulatory network.|$|E

5|$|The Bird Community Index, {{a measure}} of the quality of a habitat based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> songbirds, has been tested for most of the {{watershed}} of Nescopeck Creek. The Bird Community Index was high in one area near the source of Nescopeck Creek. In all other areas of the watershed, the index was low to medium. One of the lowest values is near Nescopeck Creek's mouth. The Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (HBI) has been measured for a number of sites along Nescopeck Creek and its tributaries. Upstream of the Jeddo Tunnel, Little Nescopeck Creek B has a high HBI. However, just downstream of the Jeddo Tunnel, the HBI drops off by a large amount. Black Creek has an HBI of 0 to 6.6, and this tributary's biodiversity is lower at its headwaters than at its confluence with Nescopeck Creek. Nescopeck Creek's HBI is from 1.7 to 5.4, depending on the site. In Nescopeck Creek, the total number of macroinvertebrate taxa at several sites ranges from 5 to 26. In Little Nescopeck Creek, the values range from 1 to 18. In Black Creek, the number ranges from 0 to 11.|$|E
