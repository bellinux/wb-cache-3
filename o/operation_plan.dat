5|$|A {{military}} <b>operation</b> <b>plan</b> for {{the invasion}} of Ireland in support of Operation Sea Lion was drawn up by the Germans in August 1940. Occupied Ireland was to be ruled along with Britain in a temporary administrative system divided into six military-economic commands, {{with one of the}} headquarters being situated in Dublin. Ireland's future position in the New Order is unclear, but it is known that Hitler would have united Ulster with the Irish state.|$|E

5|$|The {{next year}} the Namibian War of Independence began when the South-West Africa People's Organisation's (SWAPO) {{military}} wing – the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) – began guerrilla attacks on South African forces, infiltrating from bases in Zambia. The first attack was the battle at Omugulugwombashe on 26 August, and the war was a classic insurgent-counterinsurgent <b>operation.</b> <b>PLAN</b> initially established bases in northern Namibia; they were later {{forced out of the}} country by the South African Defence Force (SADF), subsequently operating from bases in southern Angola and Zambia.

5|$|The Finnish Defence Forces' {{military}} <b>operation</b> <b>plan</b> {{against the}} Soviet Union was named Venäjän keskitys ("Russian Concentration"; VK) in the 1920s. In the latest 1934 plan, the Finns saw two possible scenarios. In the VK1 scenario, the Soviets would mobilize all along their western border, and would deploy only limited forces against Finland. In {{this case the}} Finns would make counterattacks across the border. The VK2 scenario envisaged a much more unfavourable situation for the Finns. The main defense line {{would be on the}} Karelian Isthmus, the Finnish forces would repel Soviet attacks in favourable positions, and destroy the enemy by counterattacks. In the Winter War, the VK2 scenario was flexible and its basis proved correct, but the Finnish General staff badly underestimated the numerical superiority of the Red Army.|$|E

40|$|Continuity of <b>operations</b> <b>planning</b> for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) is {{critical}} for institution sustainability. The absence of such planning can result in an HBCU closing {{for an extended period}} of time after a disaster resulting in loss of revenue, research projects, students, faculty, and staff. There is a void of information on the extent of continuity of <b>operations</b> <b>planning</b> at HBCUs and how these institutions would continue functioning after a disaster. Using resilience theory as the foundation, the purpose of this qualitative case study was to explore the extent of continuity of <b>operations</b> <b>planning</b> at HBCUs in Alabama in the event of a disaster and explore opportunities to strengthen continuity planning for the future. Four HBCUs were chosen in the State of Alabama for this research. Data were collected through interviews with 5 individuals with information on continuity of <b>operations</b> <b>planning</b> at the universities selected. These data were inductively coded and subjected to thematic analysis. The results of this study indicate comprehensive continuity of <b>operations</b> <b>planning</b> is not taking place, and planners at these institutions perceive they do not have the guidance needed for effective planning and the time to conduct planning activities. It is recommended the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) develop a guideline for continuity of <b>operations</b> <b>planning</b> applicable to higher education. It is further recommended that HBCU leadership insure planners have adequate time and resources to devote to continuity of <b>operations</b> <b>planning.</b> This study fosters positive social change by bringing an awareness to FEMA and HBCU leadership of the need and importance of continuity of <b>operations</b> <b>planning</b> for institutional sustainability...|$|R

Prime Minister Sopoaga stated that Tuvalu appeared capable of handling the disaster on its own and urged that international relief be focused on Vanuatu. Tuvalu's Disaster Coordinator, Suneo Silu, said the priority island is Nui as sources of fresh water were contaminated. On March17, the Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced a donation of US$61,000 in aid to Tuvalu. UNICEF and Australia delivered aid to Tuvalu.|$|E
25|$|On 18 December 2008, Chinese {{authorities}} deployed People's Liberation Army Navy {{vessels to}} escort Chinese shipping in the Gulf of Aden. This deployment {{came after a}} series of attacks and attempted hijackings on Chinese vessels by Somali pirates. Reports suggest two destroyers (Type 052C 171 Haikou and Type 052B 169 Wuhan) and a supply ship are the ones being used. This move was welcomed by the international community as the warships complement a multinational fleet already operating along the coast of Africa. Since this <b>operation</b> <b>PLAN</b> has sought the leadership of the ‘Shared Awareness and Deconfliction (SHADE)' body, which would require {{an increase in the number}} of ships contributing to the anti-piracy fleet. This is the first time Chinese warships have deployed outside the Asia-Pacific region for a military operation since Zheng He's expeditions in the 15th century.|$|E

25|$|The war minister, Ismail Enver, devised an <b>operation</b> <b>plan</b> {{while he}} was at the Department of War in Istanbul. His {{strategy}} was based on German principles copied from Napoleon. Enver's plan involved a single envelopment using three Corps. On the right flank, XI Corps would fix the Russians in place and conduct feint attacks. In the center, IX Corps would fight in the direction of Sarikamish Pass. Assistant Chief of Staff Colonel Hafız Hakkı’s X Corps, which was to be on the left flank, would drive to Oltu, cross the Allahuekber Mountains, cut the Kars road, and drive the Russians to the Aras Valley, where the Russian forces would be destroyed by all three Corps attacking in concert. Meanwhile, a detachment unit under Stange Bey would conduct highly visible operations to distract and pin Russian units. Success depended on all troops arriving at their specified objectives at the correct moment. The first part of the plan was fulfilled when the Russians concentrated their forces at Sarikamish and Köprüköy after the Bergmann Offensive.|$|E
