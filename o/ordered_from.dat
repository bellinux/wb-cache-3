5|$|American {{analysts were}} elated when they {{discovered}} {{that the number of}} trucks ordered by North Vietnam from its communist allies in late 1971 exceeded those of previous years. 6,000 vehicles had been <b>ordered</b> <b>from</b> the Soviet Union alone (as opposed to the usual 3,000) and this seemed to indicate that the enemy was hurting for transportation and that the campaign was working. However, since 80 percent of the vehicles arrived in North Vietnam at least six weeks before the launching of the Nguyen Hue Offensive (known to the U.S. as the Easter Offensive, they probably reflected anticipated losses.|$|E

The Chilean congress responded by allocating money for its own dreadnoughts, which were <b>ordered</b> <b>from</b> the United Kingdom despite a strong push from the American government for the contracts, probably due to Chile's traditionally strong ties with the British.|$|E

Cöln was built by the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Bremen. Wiesbaden and Rostock were built at AG Vulcan in Stettin, and Leipzig, Ersatz Cöln, and Ersatz Emden were <b>ordered</b> <b>from</b> the AG Weser dockyard in Bremen.

5|$|Germany and the Netherlands were {{eventually}} {{able to reach}} an agreement where Germany would release plans and drawings based upon their ideas for a battlecruiser, in return for a guarantee that all needed equipment would be <b>ordered</b> <b>from</b> German firms. With their assistance (mainly through NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw), a rough design was formulated by February 1940. A visit to Italy prompted a rethink of the internal layout, which led to a set of drawings dated 19 April 1940. This is the last known design produced prior to Germany's invasion and occupation of the Netherlands. Final plans for the ships were never completed, and the ships were never constructed.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, the Prussian Navy sent then-Korvettenkapitän Alexander von Monts to Austria {{to examine}} the new Whitehead torpedoes then being {{developed}} there. Albrecht von Stosch, {{the commander in chief}} of the new Imperial German Navy, approved a plan to develop a torpedo arm for the German fleet, and placed Monts in charge of the program in 1873. That year, Stosch's naval construction program called for a tender for the new torpedo boats. The tender was <b>ordered</b> <b>from</b> the British firm the Thames Iron Works, and named Zieten. She was to be the last major warship purchased by the German navy from a foreign shipyard.|$|E
