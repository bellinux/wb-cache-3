5|$|The plant {{now known}} as <b>Opuntia</b> <b>ficus-indica,</b> or the Indian fig cactus, {{has long been an}} {{important}} source of food. The original species is thought to have come from central Mexico, although this is now obscure because the indigenous people of southern North America developed and distributed a range of horticultural varieties (cultivars), including forms of the species and hybrids with other opuntias. Both the fruit and pads are eaten, the former often under the Spanish name tuna, the latter under the name nopal. Cultivated forms are often significantly less spiny or even spineless. The nopal industry in Mexico was said to be worth US$150million in 2007. The Indian fig cactus was probably already present in the Caribbean when the Spanish arrived, and was soon after brought to Europe. It spread rapidly in the Mediterranean area, both naturally and by being introduced—so much so, early botanists assumed it was native to the area. Outside the Americas, the Indian fig cactus is an important commercial crop in Sicily, Algeria and other North African countries. Fruits of other opuntias are also eaten, generally under the same name, tuna. Flower buds, particularly of Cylindropuntia species, are also consumed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Opuntia</b> <b>ficus-indica</b> {{is being}} {{advantageously}} used in Tunisia and Algeria to slow and direct sand movement {{and enhance the}} restoration of vegetative cover, minimizing deterioration of built terraces with its deep and strong rooting system.|$|E
25|$|<b>Opuntia</b> <b>ficus-indica</b> is polyploid, {{hermaphrodite}} and autogamous. As Opuntia species grow in semi-arid environments, {{the main}} limiting {{factor in their}} environment is water. They have developed a number of adaptations to dry conditions, notably succulence.|$|E
25|$|As {{the fruits}} of <b>Opuntia</b> <b>ficus-indica</b> are delicate, {{they need to be}} {{carefully}} harvested by hand. The small spines on the fruits are removed by rubbing them on an abrasive surface or sweeping them through grass. Before consumption, they are peeled and sliced.|$|E
25|$|The {{perennial}} shrub <b>Opuntia</b> <b>ficus-indica</b> {{can grow}} up to 3-5m height, with thick, succulent and oblong to spatulate stems called cladodes. It has a water-repellent and sun-reflecting waxy epidermis. Cladodes that are 1–2 years old produce flowers, the fruit's colours ranging from pale green to deep red.|$|E
25|$|One {{benefit of}} <b>Opuntia</b> <b>ficus-indica</b> for {{human and animal}} {{consumption}} is its water content in an arid environment, containing about 85% water as an important source for wildlife. The seeds contain 3-10% of protein and 6-13% of fatty acids, mainly linoleic acid. As the fruit contains vitamin C (containing 25–30mg per 100g), it was once used to mitigate scurvy. There are high levels of selenium in Opuntia.|$|E
25|$|The pads of {{the plant}} (mainly used as fodder) {{also need to be}} {{harvested}} by hand. The pads are cut with a knife, detaching the pad from the plant in the joint. If <b>Opuntia</b> <b>ficus-indica</b> is cultivated for forage production, spineless cultivars are preferred. However, also wild types {{of the plant}}s are used as fodder. In these cases, the spines need to be removed from the pads to avoid damage to the animals. Mostly, this is achieved by burning the spines off the pads.|$|E
25|$|Sicily {{has long}} been noted for its fertile soil due to the {{volcanic}} eruptions {{in the past and}} present. The local agriculture is also helped by the pleasant climate of the island. The main agricultural products are wheat, citrons, oranges (Arancia Rossa di Sicilia IGP), lemons, tomatoes (Pomodoro di Pachino IGP), olives, olive oil, artichokes, <b>Opuntia</b> <b>ficus-indica</b> (Fico d'India dell'Etna DOP), almonds, grapes, pistachios (Pistacchio di Bronte DOP) and wine. Cattle and sheep are raised. The cheese productions are particularly important thanks to the Ragusano DOP and the Pecorino Siciliano DOP. Ragusa is noted for its honey (Miele Ibleo) and chocolate (Cioccolato di Modica IGP) productions.|$|E
25|$|O. ficus-indica is {{sensitive}} to lack of oxygen in the root zone, requiring well-drained soils. <b>Opuntia</b> <b>ficus-indica</b> is similar to CAM species which are not salt-tolerant in their root zone where growth may cease under high salt concentration. O. ficus-indica grows usually in regions where relative humidity is above 60% and saturation deficit occurs. O. ficus-indica is absent in regions where there is less than 40% humidity {{for more than a}} month. Mean daily temperature required to develop is at least 1.5-2°C. At -10 to -12°C, prickly pear growth is inhibited even if it is exposed to these temperatures only for a few minutes. The maximum temperature limit of prickly pear is above 50°C.|$|E
25|$|Dactylopius coccus is {{native to}} {{tropical}} and subtropical South America and Mexico, where their host cacti grow natively. They have been widely introduced to many regions where their host cacti also grow. About 200 species of Opuntia cacti are known, {{and while it is}} possible to cultivate cochineal on almost all of them, the most common is <b>Opuntia</b> <b>ficus-indica.</b> D. coccus has only been noted on Opuntia species, including O. amyclaea, O. atropes, O. cantabrigiensis, O. brasilienis, O. ficus-indica, O. fuliginosa, O. jaliscana, O. leucotricha, O. lindheimeri, O. microdasys, O. megacantha, O. pilifera, O. robusta, O. sarca, O. schikendantzii, O. stricta, O. streptacantha, and O. tomentosa. Feeding cochineals can damage and kill the plant. Other cochineal species feed on many of the same Opuntia, and the wide range of hosts reported for D. coccus likely is because of the difficulty in distinguishing it from other Dactylopius species.|$|E
25|$|In current research, the {{significant}} relationship between immune factors and hangover severity is the most convincing among all factors so far studied. An imbalance of the immune system, in particular of cytokine metabolism {{has been identified as}} playing a role in the pathophysiology of the hangover state. Especially the hangover symptoms nausea, headache, and fatigue have been suggested to be mediated by changes in the immune system. The concentration of several cytokines {{have been found to be}} significantly increased in the blood after alcohol consumption. These include interleukin 12 (IL-12), interferon gamma (IFNγ) and interleukin 10 (IL-10). Some pharmacological studies such as on tolfenamic acid and <b>Opuntia</b> <b>ficus-indica</b> (OFI) have also indicated an involvement of the immune system. These studies suggest that the presence and severity of hangover symptoms can probably be reduced by administration of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor such as aspirin or ibuprofen.|$|E
500|$|Europeans first {{encountered}} cacti {{when they arrived}} in the New World late in the 15th century. Their first landfalls were in the West Indies, where relatively few cactus genera are found; {{one of the most}} common is the genus Melocactus. Thus, melocacti were possibly among the first cacti seen by Europeans. Melocactus species were present in English collections of cacti before the end of the 16th century (by 1570 according to one source,) where they were called Echinomelocactus, later shortened to Melocactus by Joseph Pitton de Tourneville in the early 18th century. Cacti, both purely ornamental species and those with edible fruit, continued to arrive in Europe, so Carl Linnaeus was able to name 22 species by 1753. One of these, his Cactus opuntia (now part of <b>Opuntia</b> <b>ficus-indica),</b> was described as [...] "" [...] (with larger fruit ... now in Spain and Portugal), indicative of its early use in Europe.|$|E

2500|$|The most commercially {{valuable}} use for <b>Opuntia</b> <b>ficus-indica</b> {{today is}} for the large, sweet fruits, called tunas. [...] Areas with significant tuna-growing cultivation include Mexico, the Mediterranean Basin, Middle East and northern Africa. The cactus grows wild and cultivated to heights of 12–16ft (4–5 m). In Namibia, O. ficus-indica is a common drought-resistant fodder plant.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Opuntia</b> <b>ficus-indica</b> {{are planted}} in hedges {{to provide a}} cheap but {{effective}} erosion control in the Mediterranean basin. Under those hedges and adjacent areas soil physical properties, nitrogen and organic matter are considerably improved. Structural stability of the soil is enhanced, runoff and erosion are reduced, while water storage capacity and permeability is enhanced.|$|E
2500|$|Saint Helena {{produces}} {{what is said}} to be {{the most}} expensive coffee in the world. It also produces and exports Tungi Spirit, made from the fruit of the prickly or cactus pears, <b>Opuntia</b> <b>ficus-indica</b> ("Tungi" [...] is the local St Helenian name for the plant). Like Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha, Saint Helena is permitted to issue its own postage stamps, an enterprise that provides a significant income.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Opuntia</b> <b>ficus-indica</b> is {{a species}} of cactus {{that has long been}} a domesticated crop plant {{important}} in agricultural economies throughout arid and semiarid parts of the world. It is thought probably to have originated in Mexico. Some of the common English names for the plant and its fruit are [...] Indian fig opuntia, Barbary fig, cactus pear, spineless cactus, and prickly pear, although this last name has also been applied to other less common Opuntia species. In Mexican Spanish, the plant is called nopal, while the fruit is called tuna, which are names also used in American English, especially as culinary terms.|$|E
2500|$|Pest plants {{including}} Blackberry (Rubus fruticosus), bridal creeper (Asparagus asparagoides), furze (Ulex europaeus) and paterson’s curse (Echium plantagineum) {{have been}} identified as problematic weeds within the park that pose a threat to native flora populations. [...] St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) and prickly pear (<b>Opuntia</b> <b>ficus-indica)</b> occurring in the Mt Pilot Range have been brought under control but continued management is required. [...] Pest animals known to occur within the park include the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and feral cat (Felis catus). [...] Foxes and cats pose serious predation risks to native fauna while rabbits impact on native flora and are notorious for the degree of soil disturbance caused by burrowing.|$|E
2500|$|Moreover, the {{original}} {{meanings of the}} symbols were different in numerous aspects. The eagle was {{a representation of the}} sun god Huitzilopochtli, who was very important, as the Mexicas referred to themselves as the [...] "People of the Sun". The cactus (<b>Opuntia</b> <b>ficus-indica),</b> full of its fruits, called [...] "nochtli" [...] in Nahuatl, represent the island of Tenochtitlan. To the Mexicas, the snake represented wisdom, and it had strong connotations with the god Quetzalcoatl. The story of the snake was derived from an incorrect translation of the Crónica mexicáyotl by Fernando Alvarado Tezozómoc. In the story, the Nahuatl text ihuan cohuatl izomocayan, [...] "the snake hisses", was mistranslated as [...] "the snake is torn". Based on this, Father Diego Durán reinterpreted the legend so that the eagle represents all that is good and right, while the snake represents evil and sin. Despite its inaccuracy, the new legend was adopted because it conformed with European heraldic tradition. To the Europeans it would represent the struggle between good and evil. Although this interpretation does not conform to pre-Columbian traditions, it was an element that could be used by the first missionaries for the purposes of evangelism and the conversion of the native peoples.|$|E
