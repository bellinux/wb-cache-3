He trained as a psychologist {{and focused on the}} impacts <b>of</b> <b>religious</b> <b>experience.</b> Persinger {{is the author of the}} book Neuropsychological Basis of Human Belief, and since its publication he has researched and examined the physiological and neurological causes of religious belief systems. Normand Carrey received education as a medical doctor and specialized in psychiatry. He became a child psychiatrist, and worked out of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. Carrey has conducted studies into psychological resilience, and has taught physicians in a psychiatry residency program in the field of family therapy.

In the theoretical part firstly the general term <b>of</b> the <b>religious</b> <b>experience</b> is determined further the definition <b>of</b> the extraordinary <b>religious</b> <b>experiences</b> follows.

25|$|The {{psychology}} {{of religion is}} concerned with the psychological principles operative in religious communities and practitioners. William James's The Varieties <b>of</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Experience</b> analyzed personal experience as contrasted with the social phenomenon of religion. Some issues of concern to the psychologist of religions are the psychological nature of religious conversion, the making of religious decisions, religion and happiness, and the psychological factors in evaluating religious claims.|$|E
25|$|American {{psychologist}} and philosopher William James (1842–1910) is regarded by most psychologists of religion as {{the founder of}} the field. He {{served as president of the}} American Psychological Association, and wrote one of the first psychology textbooks. In the psychology of religion, James' influence endures. His Varieties <b>of</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Experience</b> is considered to be the classic work in the field, and references to James' ideas are common at professional conferences.|$|E
25|$|An objectivist {{would argue}} that the <b>religious</b> <b>experience</b> is a proof of God's existence. However, others have criticised the {{reliability}} <b>of</b> <b>religious</b> <b>experiences.</b> The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes asked how it was possible {{to tell the difference between}} talking to God in a dream, and dreaming about talking to God.|$|R
5000|$|Accounts <b>of</b> <b>religious</b> <b>experiences</b> often speak <b>of</b> a [...] "call" [...] from God, or a [...] "pull" [...] {{from some}} Higher Power; this {{sometimes}} starts a [...] "dialogue" [...] between the man woman and this [...] "higher Source"...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{interest}} in the psychopharmacological underpinnings <b>of</b> <b>religious</b> <b>experiences</b> has led to both the laboratory characterizations of drug-induced mystical events and psychobiological models <b>of</b> <b>religious</b> <b>experiences</b> rooted in evolution and fitness. Our examination of this literature suggests that these theories may be congruent only within more modern religious and cultural settings and are not generalizable to all historical beliefs, {{as would be expected}} from an evolutionarily conserved biological mechanism. The strong influence of culture on the subjective effects of drugs as well as religious thoughts argues against the concept of a common pathway in the brain uniquely responsible for these experiences. Rather, the role of personal beliefs, expectations and experiences may interject bias into the interpretation of psychoactive drug action as a reflection <b>of</b> biologically based <b>religious</b> thought. Thus, psychobiological research proposing specific brain mechanisms should consider anthropological and historical data to address alternative explanations to the "fitness" <b>of</b> <b>religious</b> thought. A psychobiological model <b>of</b> the <b>religious</b> <b>experience</b> based on the concept of cognitive unbinding seems to accommodate these data better than that of a specific brain locus of religion...|$|R
25|$|I {{should say}} the {{defendants}} have {{done just that}} {{for which they are}} indicted. If I might agree to their conviction without creating a precedent, I cheerfully would do so.

But that does not dispose of the constitutional question whether misrepresentation <b>of</b> <b>religious</b> <b>experience</b> or belief is prosecutable; it rather emphasizes the danger of such prosecutions.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, {{interest}} in reincarnation {{had been introduced}} into the nascent discipline of psychology, {{largely due to the}} influence of William James, who raised aspects of the philosophy of mind, comparative religion, the psychology <b>of</b> <b>religious</b> <b>experience</b> and the nature of empiricism. James was influential in the founding of the American Society for Psychical Research (ASPR) in New York City in 1885, three years after the British Society for Psychical Research (SPR) was inaugurated in London, leading to systematic, critical investigation of paranormal phenomena.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, this {{development}} of a pagan order created the foundations of a bridge of reconciliation over which paganism and Christianity could meet. Likewise, Julian’s persecution of Christians, who by pagan standards were simply part of a different cult, was quite an un-pagan attitude that transformed paganism into a religion that accepted only one form <b>of</b> <b>religious</b> <b>experience</b> while excluding all others—such as Christianity. In trying to compete with Christianity in this manner, Julian fundamentally {{changed the nature of}} pagan worship. That is, he made paganism a religion, whereas it once had been only a system of tradition.|$|E

50|$|James had {{relatively}} {{little interest in}} the legitimacy or illegitimacy <b>of</b> <b>religious</b> <b>experiences.</b> Further, despite James' examples being almost exclusively drawn from Christianity, he did not mean to limit his ideas to any single religion. <b>Religious</b> <b>experiences</b> are something that people sometimes have under certain conditions. In James' description, these conditions are likely to be psychological or pharmaceutical rather than cultural.|$|R

500|$|Chekhov's contemporaries {{believed}} Ivan's epiphany {{in the end}} of [...] "The Student" [...] {{represented a}} [...] "conversion" [...] for the agnostic author himself. This was echoed a century later when metropolitan bishop Veniamin (Fedchenkov) wrote, [...] "nowhere does Chekhov write ill about the Orthodox clergy". According to Veniamin, the effect of [...] "The Student" [...] is indescribably moving, even to nonbelievers. Andrey Shcherbenok wrote that Ivan's reinvigoration with beauty and truth at the story's end has been viewed as [...] " [...] with the authorial perspective" [...] but that [...] "The problem with this interpretation is that the narrative agency in 'The Student' is so fluid {{that it is difficult to}} separate the voice of the authorial narrator from that of a hero." [...] Mark Stanley Swift commented that Veniamin's reading of the story [...] "confuses the poignant portrayal of the faithful and the intimate depiction <b>of</b> <b>religious</b> <b>experience</b> for personal belief on the part of the author". Cathy Popkin presented an alternate interpretation of the story's ending, writing that Ivan's epiphany may have instead been intended by Chekhov to be [...] "a transitory result of [...] youthful impetuosity, a phase of no lasting significance". Robert Louis Jackson wrote that Chekhov may have changed the story's title from its first publication (when it was called [...] "In the Evening") to its second [...] "not simply because the story moves from darkness to light... but because with respect to the essential lessons of life he believed that the human being is an eternal student, forever failing, forever drawing a deep spiritual breath, and forever restarting the journey".|$|E

I decided to use as my technique the un-timed, unstructured interview, supplemented if necessary by questions designed only to clarify and elucidate. As a former personal counsellor, I was aware of the necessity of being warm, non-judgemental and empathetically (and in this context silently) encouraging. I asked my volunteers to tell me about any ‘relatively short, intense spiritual experience’ they might have had, the attendant circumstances and any possible ‘triggers’, and what had been the final effects or outcomes. To provide some quantitative data it was proposed to ask participants to rate aspects of their experiences on a scale of 1 to 5...|$|R
