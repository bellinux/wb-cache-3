5|$|Fans {{were excited}} by the character's reveal, and {{professional}} players praised the balance of his move set. <b>Other</b> <b>critics</b> considered Doomfist too vulnerable to be viable, and insufficiently exciting to rekindle the interest of old players.|$|E

5000|$|He {{is widely}} {{recognized}} {{for his work}} in a variety of so-called [...] "post-rock" [...] bands, namely Radian, Trapist, and Autistic Daughters, [...] among <b>others.</b> <b>Critic</b> Brian Olewnick has called Brandlmayr's work [...] "extraordinarily precise".|$|R
6000|$|She {{expressed}} {{it as the}} poor lady's <b>other</b> <b>critic</b> had done, but this didn't shut my mouth. [...] "Ah, then, {{in spite of the}} people, you did notice. What do you mean by 'all over the place'?" ...|$|R
5|$|Headley did {{not play}} any {{first-class}} cricket in the West Indies in 1933–34, but returned to Jamaica in readiness for the 1934–35 MCC tour. The visiting team, under the captaincy of Bob Wyatt, was stronger than English teams that had previously toured the Caribbean; despite some shortcomings, Wisden and <b>other</b> <b>critics</b> considered it strong enough for the task in hand.|$|E
5|$|In her 2006 book on Opus Dei, Maggy Whitehouse, a non-Catholic journalist, {{argues that}} the {{relative}} autonomy of each director and center has resulted in mistakes at the local level. She recommends greater consistency and transparency for Opus Dei, which she sees as having learned the lesson of greater openness when it faced {{the issues raised by}} The Da Vinci Code and <b>other</b> <b>critics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Solo {{received}} mixed reviews, with {{a number}} of critics pointing to the convoluted and unstirring plot. <b>Other</b> <b>critics</b> saw the book as being equal with, or superior to, Fleming's stronger novels. The book sold well, appearing in the top ten-selling book lists in the UK.|$|E
5000|$|Bowling {{has said}} the film is {{inspired}} by The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Switchblade Sisters, Raquel Welch, Doris Wishman, and Joey Ramone, among <b>others.</b> <b>Critics</b> have {{described it as a}} [...] "feminist slasher movie" [...] and reminiscent of a [...] "beach movie".|$|R
50|$|In 2008, Lane {{was named}} one of the top 30 critics in the world by More Intelligent Life, the web version of the {{lifestyle}} publication from The Economist. As of 2010, the movie review aggregation website Metacritic weighted Lane's movie reviews higher than any <b>other</b> <b>critic's.</b>|$|R
5000|$|It {{has also}} been noted that, except for the [...] "Ellos", none of the invaders is truly evil; they are noble beings forced {{to carry out the}} orders of <b>others.</b> <b>Critics</b> believe Oesterheld was conceptually attacking the Dirty War or writing an allegory of class struggle.|$|R
5|$|Arkham Origins was {{considered}} an incremental installment for the series, rather than a transformative one. GameSpot said that Arkham City expanded on Arkham Asylum by applying the game mechanics to a larger open-world setting, but criticized Arkham Origins for replicating Arkham City without moving the series forward. <b>Other</b> <b>critics</b> agreed, saying that the game's well-received elements from the previous game were not significantly developed or augmented and it was routine rather than inspired. However, other reviewers rated it {{on a par with}} Arkham City.|$|E
5|$|Chartjackers {{garnered}} a viewing figures peak {{of almost}} half a million with its final episode and was critically panned by reviewers. Some commentators felt that the programme's concept was ridiculous and doomed from the start, others felt that the series showed a contempt for music and the general public, and <b>other</b> <b>critics</b> questioned whether {{the point of the}} project was to raise money for charity or for the four bloggers to promote themselves. The show was nominated for a 2010 Broadcast Digital Award in the Best Multi-Platform Project category, but lost out to The Operation...Surgery Live.|$|E
5|$|Critics of the ESRB have {{asserted}} that the organization has {{a conflict of interest}} because of its vested interest in the video game industry, and that the ESRB does not rate certain games, such as the Grand Theft Auto series, harshly enough for their violent or sexual content in order to protect their commercial viability. Contrarily, <b>other</b> <b>critics</b> have argued that, at the same time, the ESRB rates certain games too strongly for their content, and that its influence has stifled the viability of adult-oriented video games due to the board's restrictions on how they are marketed and sold.|$|E
5000|$|The show {{featured}} two {{critics who}} would present short clips of movies in current release then debate {{the merits of}} the films, energetically defending their remarks if the <b>other</b> <b>critic</b> disagreed. A designated [...] "dog of the week" [...] was also featured, with [...] "Spot the Wonder Dog" [...] barking on cue as an introduction.|$|R
25|$|<b>Other</b> {{business}} <b>critics</b> {{argue that}} the RMA is destructive of property rights.|$|R
2500|$|The Real Inspector Hound {{opens with}} two theatre critics, Moon and Birdboot. Since Moon's superior, Higgs, is unavailable, Moon is {{called upon to}} review the production. The <b>other</b> <b>critic,</b> Birdboot, seems to have an {{interest}} in the young actress playing Felicity Cunningham. Birdboot states that he is a [...] "respectable married man", yet Moon's comments direct the audience to doubt this statement.|$|R
5|$|Despite debuting with {{moderate}} viewing figures, {{the departure of}} Carell affected the show's ratings, which fell as the season progressed. The season ranked as the eighty-seventh most watched television series during the 2011–12 television year and saw a dramatic decrease in ratings from the previous season. Critical reception was polarized. Many critics argued that the series should have ended after the departure of Carell; many also felt that the season recycled storylines from past episodes. <b>Other</b> <b>critics</b> were more positive, complimenting various actors and their characters. It {{marked the first time}} since season one that the show did not receive any Emmy nominations.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Leigh and Laurence Olivier {{performed}} {{two plays}} about Cleopatra, William Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra and George Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra, alternating the play each night and winning good reviews. They took the productions to New York, where they performed a {{season at the}} Ziegfeld Theatre into 1952. The reviews there were also mostly positive, but film critic Kenneth Tynan angered them when he suggested that Leigh's was a mediocre talent that forced Olivier to compromise his own. Tynan's diatribe almost precipitated another collapse; Leigh, terrified of failure and intent on achieving greatness, dwelt on his comments and ignored the positive reviews of <b>other</b> <b>critics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Insurrection was the highest-grossing film on {{its opening}} weekend, making $70.1 {{million in the}} United States and Canada and an {{additional}} $42.4 million in other territories, for a theatrical run of about $112.5 million worldwide. Critical responses to the film were mixed; the performance of Patrick Stewart and the directing of Jonathan Frakes were praised, while <b>other</b> <b>critics</b> compared it to an extended episode of the television series. Insurrection was nominated for both a Saturn Award and a Hugo Award, but the only award it received was a Youth in Film Award for Michael Welch.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{publication}} of Fisher's work, the term has been picked up by <b>other</b> literary <b>critics.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Both Sissela Bok and Jay Parini {{reviewed}} the 1987 edition along with new biographies of Sartre. Bok noted that her [...] "perspective, rooted, as was Sartre's, in philosophy and in literature" [...] was {{necessary in order}} to understand Sartre's [...] "role and his intellectual legacy". Similarly, Parini concluded in The Hudson Review that Murdoch [...] "has understood Sartre better than any <b>other</b> <b>critic</b> thus far".|$|R
50|$|<b>Other</b> textual <b>critics</b> {{gave more}} {{examples}} of conflation (Matthew 27:41, John 18:40, Acts 20:28, and Romans 6:12).|$|R
5|$|LGBT rights activists, {{human rights}} activists, and <b>other</b> <b>critics</b> {{stated that the}} broad and vague wording of the law, which was {{characterized}} as a ban on gay propaganda by the media, made {{it a crime to}} publicly make statements or distribute materials in support of LGBT rights, hold pride parades or similar demonstrations, state that gay relationships are equal to heterosexual relationships, or according to Human Rights Campaign (HRC) president Chad Griffin, even display LGBT symbols such as the rainbow flag or kiss a same-sex partner in public. The first arrest made under the law involved a person who publicly protested with a sign containing a pro-LGBT message.|$|E
5|$|Lie is {{considered}} influential to the colony's journalism, linguistics, and literature. According to the Malaysian scholar Ahmad Adam, {{he is best}} remembered for his literary works. Several of his writings were printed multiple times, and Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari was adapted for the stage and screen. However, {{as a result of}} the language politics in the Indies and independent Indonesia, his work has become marginalised. When several of his writings were revealed as uncredited adaptations of existing works, Lie was criticised as unoriginal. <b>Other</b> <b>critics,</b> however, have found evidence of innovation in his writing style and handling of plots.|$|E
5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>critics</b> emphasise {{that the}} letter's object, Lord Molesworth, was {{targeted}} to bind the higher and lower classes together. Using Molesworth, a religious dissenter, a nobleman, and {{the opposite of}} Swift, the Drapier unites all of the various people of Ireland in a common nationalist cause. Instead of defending charges against himself, the Drapier is calling up more support for the Irish cause; he seeks attention so that the greater liberty of Ireland will be respected.|$|E
25|$|However, Brave New World also {{received}} negative responses from <b>other</b> contemporary <b>critics,</b> although {{his work was}} later embraced.|$|R
5000|$|On the <b>other</b> hand, <b>critic</b> Jeffrey Westhoff {{disliked the}} film and stated: [...] "Some books should remain books." ...|$|R
50|$|In 2005, the Chico News & Review {{started the}} Chico Area Music Celebration (CAMMIES) {{to honor the}} vibrant, eclectic music scene in Butte County, California. Winners are {{selected}} by CN&R readers in a list of musical genres, including Singer-songwriter, Hard Rock/Metal, Blues, Jam/R&B/Funk, Rap, Punk/Ska and <b>others.</b> <b>Critics</b> vote for winners in more specific areas, e.g. Best Male/Female vocalist, Best Guitarist, Best Drummer, Best Local CD, Local Badass, etc.|$|R
5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>critics</b> even {{in later}} years insisted that the {{character}} of Shylock is that of an outsider separated from society, that the Jewish Shylock represented an older form of justice, meant to be supplanted by the Christian view, represented by Portia, who argued for the prevalence of mercy. Shylock, these critics maintained, must be removed {{in order to allow}} society to attain a Christian form of peace. Hazlitt's view, however, has remained as a valid countervailing concept of the play, one that does not arrive at easy conclusions or take sides readily.|$|E
5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>critics</b> view Motörhead as {{the first}} {{significant}} exponent of the movement and the first band to fully implement a crossover between punk rock and heavy metal. Their fast music, the renunciation of technical virtuosity in favour of sheer loudness, and their uncompromising attitude were welcomed equally by punks and heavy metal fans. Motörhead were supported by many NWOBHM bands on tour, and they also shared the stage with Lemmy's friends punk band The Damned. Motörhead's musical style became very popular during the NWOBHM, making them a fundamental reference for the nascent movement and for musicians of various metal subgenres in the following decades.|$|E
5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>critics,</b> {{especially}} women who identify as feminists but sharply differ with Dworkin's style or positions, have offered nuanced views, suggesting that Dworkin {{called attention to}} real and important problems, but that her legacy as a whole had been destructive to the women's movement. Her work and activism on pornography—especially {{in the form of}} the Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance—drew heavy criticism from groups such as the Feminist Anti-Censorship Task Force (FACT) and even some fellow anti-pornography feminists, who criticized the Dworkin–MacKinnon legal approach as undermining civil rights.|$|E
50|$|<b>Others</b> <b>critics</b> have {{expressed}} similar {{doubts about the}} reality of Tolentino's biographical claims, such as being advised to write in English by Samuel Beckett, given {{the quality of his}} writing in Portuguese. Some, such as the poet and critic Ivan Junqueira, do not consider the issues mentioned above as real cases of plagiarism and hoaxing inTolentino's career, highlighting instead his mastery of the art of pastiching the classics.|$|R
50|$|<b>Other</b> major <b>critics</b> {{included}} Paul Elmer More and Irving Babbitt, {{although neither}} of these was as vitriolic as Sherman.|$|R
50|$|Berendt was awarded, amongst <b>others,</b> the <b>critic's</b> {{award of}} German television, the culture award of Poland, and twice the Bundesfilmpreis.|$|R
