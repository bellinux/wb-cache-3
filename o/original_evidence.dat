5|$|Laws {{dealing with}} digital {{evidence}} {{are concerned with}} two issues: integrity and authenticity. Integrity is ensuring {{that the act of}} seizing and acquiring digital media does not modify the evidence (either the original or the copy). Authenticity refers to the ability to confirm the integrity of information; for example that the imaged media matches the <b>original</b> <b>evidence.</b> The ease with which digital media can be modified means that documenting the chain of custody from the crime scene, through analysis and, ultimately, to the court, (a form of audit trail) is important to establish the authenticity of evidence.|$|E

500|$|Pending retrial, Glasser {{was free}} on $2,500 bail. Attorney General Francis Biddle {{appointed}} Edward A. Kelly {{as a special}} assistant to consider whether Glasser should be retried. Kelly recommended that Glasser not be retried, and Biddle wrote to Judge Evan Alfred Evans of the Seventh Circuit asking him to assign a judge to the nol pros motion; Judge Evans assigned himself. Over the protests of Judge Evans, all charges against Glasser were dropped on January 6, 1943. Kelly argued to Judge Evans {{that there would be}} insufficient evidence at a retrial because much of the <b>original</b> <b>evidence</b> would not be admissible if Glasser were retried alone. Judge Evans was [...] "suspicious" [...] of the motion and [...] "all but argued that the case had been fixed." [...] Glasser returned to private practice.|$|E
40|$|AbstractFor {{the case}} of {{evidence}} ordered in a complete directed acyclic graph this paper presents a new algorithm with lower computational complexity for Dempster's rule than that of step-by-step application of Dempster's rule. In this problem, every <b>original</b> pair of <b>evidences,</b> has a corresponding evidence against the simultaneous belief in both propositions. In this case, it is uncertain whether the propositions of any two evidences are in logical conflict. The <b>original</b> <b>evidences</b> {{are associated with the}} vertices and the additional evidences are associated with the edges. The <b>original</b> <b>evidences</b> are ordered, i. e., for every pair of evidences it is determinable which of the two evidences is the earlier one. We are interested in finding the most probable completely specified path through the graph, where transitions are possible only from lower- to higher-ranked vertices. The path is here a representation for a sequence of states, for instance a sequence of snapshots of a physical object's track. A completely specified path means that the path includes no other vertices than those stated in the path representation, as opposed to an incompletely specified path that may also include other vertices than those stated. In a hierarchical network of all subsets of the frame, i. e., of all incompletely specified paths, the <b>original</b> and additional <b>evidences</b> support subsets that are not disjoint, thus {{it is not possible to}} prune the network to a tree. Instead of propagating belief, the new algorithm reasons about the logical conditions of a completely specified path through the graph. The new algorithm is O(|Θ| log|Θ|), compared to O(|Θ|log|Θ|) of the classic brute force algorithm. After a detailed presentation of the reasoning behind the new algorithm we conclude that it is feasible to reason without approximation about completely specified paths through a complete directed acyclic graph...|$|R

First, because of the fuzziness of information received by sensors, membership functions are introduced to describe the fault template mode in model database and features extracted from sensor observations; then the degrees of matching between them are obtained using random set model of fuzzy information, which can be transformed into BPAs. Second, cosine similarity measure of evidence is introduced to compute confidence degree of <b>evidence.</b> Finally, <b>original</b> <b>evidences</b> are modified according to the confidence degree. The diagnosis results of rotor system show that the proposed method can improve the accuracy of decision-making...|$|R

500|$|Giuseppe Conlon, Sarah's husband, {{was convicted}} in 1976 along with six members of the Maguire family (the seven being dubbed the Maguire Seven) of running an IRA bomb factory in North London, {{on the basis of}} {{forensic}} evidence. Each was sentenced to up to 14 years in jail, served their sentences, and with the exception of Giuseppe Conlon who died in 1980, were released. The Maguire Seven's first appeal, in 1977, was turned down, but a later appeal, prompted by the release of the Guildford Four, found that test kits used to detect traces of explosives had been contaminated. In 1991, the Court of Appeal quashed their convictions after it was ruled the <b>original</b> <b>evidence</b> against them was unsafe. On 9 February 2005, then Prime Minister Tony Blair issued a public apology to the Maguire Seven and the Guildford Four for the miscarriages of justice they had suffered, saying that he was [...] "very sorry that they were subject to such an ordeal and such an injustice", and that [...] "they deserve to be completely and publicly exonerated." ...|$|E

Storing, however, argues that the case against Lee's authorship is also weak. Work produced since Wood's paper has been mixed in its attribution of the pamphlets, with some writers not naming an author and others citing the work as Lee's. Authors who have taken the time to comment on the debate generally concur with Wood, and no scholar has attempted a substantial refutation of Wood's paper. Walter Bennett, editor of a 1979 edition of the Federal Farmer, disagrees with Wood on many points but concludes that the evidence for Lee is not [...] "sufficient to justify continuing this attribution."

40|$|As the Internet becomes {{larger in}} scale, more complex in {{structure}} and more diversified in traffic, {{the number of}} crimes that utilize computer technologies is also increasing at a phenomenal rate. To react to {{the increasing number of}} computer crimes, the field of computer and network forensics has emerged. The general purpose of network forensics is to find malicious users or activities by gathering and dissecting firm evidences about computer crimes, e. g., hacking. However, due to the large volume of Internet traffic, not all the traffic captured and analyzed is valuable for investigation or confirmation. After analyzing some existing network forensics methods to identify common shortcomings, we propose in this paper a new network forensics method that uses a combination of network vulnerability and network evidence graph. In our proposed method, we use vulnerability evidence and reasoning algorithm to reconstruct attack scenarios and then backtrack the network packets to find the <b>original</b> <b>evidences.</b> Our proposed method can reconstruct attack scenarios effectively and then identify multi-staged attacks through evidential reasoning. Results of experiments show that the evidence graph constructed using our method is more complete and credible while possessing the reasoning capability...|$|R
