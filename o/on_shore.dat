Most of the bridge crew were killed or wounded by the blast, including First Lieutenant Victor Crutchley, who staggered to the wheel and attempted to force the ship to make the full turn into the channel.

5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} at Dwarka, both <b>on</b> <b>shore</b> {{and offshore}} in the Arabian Sea, {{have been performed}} by the Archaeological Survey of India. The first investigations carried out on land in 1963 revealed many artifacts. Excavations done at two sites on the seaward side of Dwarka brought to light submerged settlements, a large stone-built jetty, and triangular stone anchors with three holes. The settlements are {{in the form of}} exterior and interior walls, and fort bastions. From the typological classification of the anchors it is inferred that Dwarka had flourished as a port during the period of the Middle kingdoms of India. Coastal erosion was probably the cause of the destruction of what was an ancient port.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Civil War, all aircraft, equipment, materiel, and {{facilities}} belonging to the Liberian Air Force were badly damaged, rendering the force inoperable. During the Civil War the Taylor government made a variety of different air support arrangements; a seemingly inoperable Mil Mi-2 and Mil Mi-8, one in Anti-Terrorist Unit markings, could be seen at Spriggs Payne Airport in central Monrovia in mid-2005, apparently a hangover from the war. Meanwhile, during the Taylor era, the Navy consisted of a couple of small patrol craft.

40|$|Epilithic biofilm <b>on</b> rocky <b>shores</b> is {{regulated}} by physico-chemical and biological factors and is {{important as a}} source of food for benthic organisms. The influences of environmental and grazing pressure on spatial variability of biomass of biofilm were evaluated <b>on</b> <b>shores</b> <b>on</b> the north coast of Sao Paulo State (SE Brazil). A general trend of greater abundance of microalgae was observed lower <b>on</b> the <b>shore,</b> but neither of the environmental factors evaluated (wave exposure and shore level) showed consistent effects, and differences were found among specific shores or times (September 2007 and March 2008). The abundance of slow-moving grazers (limpets and littorinids) showed a negative correlation with chlorophyll a concentration <b>on</b> <b>shores.</b> However, experimental exclusion of these grazers failed to show consistent results at small spatial scales. Observations of divergent abundances of the isopod Ligia exotica and biomass of biofilm on isolated boulders <b>on</b> <b>shores</b> led to a short exclusion experiment, where the grazing pressure by L. exotica significantly decreased microalgal biomass. The result suggests that grazing activities of this fast-moving consumer probably mask the influence of slow-moving grazers at small spatial scales, while both have an additive effect at larger scales that masks environmental influences. This is the first evaluation {{of the impact of the}} fast-moving herbivore L. exotica on microalgal biomass <b>on</b> rocky <b>shores</b> and opens an interesting discussion about the role of these organisms in subtropical coastal environments.

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{patterns in the}} distribution and demography of the barnacle Chthamalus stellatus (Poli) at different spatial scales in the northwest Mediterranean. Preliminary data indicated that the abundance and size of barnacles decreased from high-shore to low-shore habitats. The generality of these patterns was investigated at several locations (10 s to 100 s of km apart), at several sites within locations (100 s to 1000 s of m apart) and at different times, patterns {{were consistent with the}} preliminary observations, despite considerable spatial and temporal variability at small and large spatial scales. The following models were proposed to explain the observed patterns: (1) recruitment was intrinsically greater high <b>on</b> the <b>shore,</b> (2) limitation of recruitment due to pre-emption of the substratum was greater low than high <b>on</b> the <b>shore,</b> (3) environmental conditions reduce growth low <b>on</b> the <b>shore,</b> and (4) mortality was greater low <b>on</b> the <b>shore.</b> The predictions of these models were tested by examining patterns of recruitment, growth and mortality of barnacles and availability of free space in relation to height <b>on</b> the <b>shore,</b> at several spatial scales and through time. Successful recruitment of barnacles was observed at different heights <b>on</b> the <b>shore</b> where resident organisms were removed, despite a trend toward a larger number of recruits high <b>on</b> the <b>shore</b> at 1 location (Livorno). Availability of bare rock for recruitment was greater high <b>on</b> the <b>shore,</b> implying that pre-emption of the substratum was more intense low <b>on</b> the <b>shore.</b> There was no evidence to suggest that barnacles grew faster <b>on</b> the high <b>shore</b> than <b>on</b> the low <b>shore.</b> The opposite pattern was observed for young barnacles in several cases. Mortality rates were generally greater in low-shore than high-shore habitats for young and for adult barnacles. Patterns emerged over a background of considerable spatial and temporal variation. These results emphasized the importance of pre-emption of space and mortality of juveniles in generating patterns in the distribution and structure of populations of barnacles <b>on</b> rocky <b>shores</b> in the northwest Mediterranean...|$|R
5|$|Female California {{sea lions}} have a 12-month {{reproductive}} cycle, {{consisting of a}} 9-month actual gestation and a 3-month delayed implantation of the fertilized egg before giving birth in June or July. Interbirth intervals are particularly long for this species, being 21 days for sea lions off California and more than 30 days for sea lions in the Gulf of California. Females remain with their pups <b>on</b> <b>shore</b> for 10 days and nurse them. After this, females will go on foraging trips lasting as long as three days, returning to nurse their pups {{for up to a}} day. Pups left <b>on</b> <b>shore</b> tend to gather in nurseries to socialize and play. When returning from a trip, females call their pups with distinctive calls to which the pups will reply in kind. A mother and pup can distinguish each other's calls from those of other mothers and pups. At first, reunions largely depend on the efforts of the mothers. However, as pups get older, they get more involved in reunions. Older pups may sometimes join their mothers during their foraging trips. Adult male California sea lions play no role in raising pups, but they do take more interest in them than adult males of other otariid species; they have even been observed to help shield swimming pups from predators. Pups are weaned by a year but can continue to suckle for another year.|$|E
