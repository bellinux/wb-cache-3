40|$|S ince the 1990 s {{researchers}} have considered {{as the dominant}} view on family obligation a set of responsibilities, duties, and <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> and assistance,that adult children should assume when parents are old or infirm. This concept is limited, because it assumes that family obligation is salient only in one period of life: when parents reach old age and are infirm. In contrast, a relational approach to family obligation considers family relationships as central to understanding children’s duties and responsibilities. Following Stein, family obligation {{can be defined as}} felt obligation: expectations for appropriate and negotiated behaviour, perceived within the context of specific personal relationships with kin across life course. Felt obligation is conceptualized in five dimensions: a duty to maintain contact, assistance, avoidance of conflict, personal sharing, and self-sufficiency. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to analyze perceptions of felt obligation in intergenerational relationships (parent–child and family of origin) in different phases of the family life cycle in a specific cultural context (Italy). The sample was composed of 92 parents with children of different ages (infants, school-aged children, and young adults). The measure addressed the five dimensions of felt obligation, all assessed in various phases of family life. Results indicated differences in dimensions of felt obligation between intergenerational relationships (both parent–child and with family of origin). Some of these differences, such as self-sufficiency and personal sharing, assumed more importance and salience in some periods of the life cycle than in others...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{fiduciary}} duty, derived from common law, {{was introduced to}} the Company Law of People’s Republic of China in 2005. The fiduciary duty plays an extremely important role in common law, particularly in U. S. corporate law. For this reason, one might have expected dramatic consequences from its introduction to Chinese law. In reality, however, few fiduciary lawsuits have been brought to the courts of China since 2005. There are three main reasons for the rarity of due care lawsuits. First, Chinese fiduciary law has neither clear content nor a practical enforcement. This is especially true of the body of fiduciary law that deals with the duty of care. This makes it difficult for lawyers to decide whether pursuing a due care lawsuit is worthwhile and for judges to establish a legal doctrine for applying and enforcing the law. Second, the traditionally harmonious culture of China discourages filing lawsuits against directors. Shareholders thus prefer other ways to solve problems, such as simply selling their stocks. Third, Chinese law imposes severe restrictions on derivative lawsuits. One such restriction is the requirement for shareholder(s) to have held at least 1 % of company stock for at least 180 consecutive days in order to be eligible for filing a derivative lawsuit. This dissertation examines China’s problematic duty-of-care law and demonstrates that it is in dire need of revision by introspecting the duty of care in Delaware and the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> of a good administrator in Taiwan. In any case, however, one cannot simply transplant a common law concept to civil law without also making a substantial effort to explain the law and adapt it to fit its new context. Otherwise, the law will inevitably suffer either from vagueness or ambiguity, both of which are sure sources of confusion. Therefore, the ambition of this dissertation is to provide the Chinese world a practical reform of the duty-of-care law that fits in the Chinese society...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject matter}} of this thesis is the {{liability}} of the sea carrier in the international carriage of goods by sea. Chapter One: discuses the nature of liability of the sea carrier under the Hague/Visby Rules and Hamburg Rules. The Hague/Visby Rules define the term “Carrier” as including the owner or the charterer who enters into contract of carriage with the shipper, while Hamburg Rules widen the definition to include any person by whom or on whose name contract of carriage of goods by sea has been concluded with a shipper. The Hague/Visby scheme of liability is built on specific obligations by which the carrier is bound, i. e. the obligation to issue a bill of lading, obligation to exercise due diligence, to provide a seaworthy ship and the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> of cargo. The failure of the carrier in the fulfillment of the obligations will expose him to cargo claims by shippers or cargo owners in cases of loss or damage to cargo. He will be held as liable for damages unless he proves that he is exempted form liability by virtue {{of one of the}} seventeen exceptions provided for in Article IV. The most significant of them are: fire; perils of the sea; force majeure, nautical fault; acts and omissions of the shipper. Hamburg Rules introduce a relatively simple scheme of liability based on the “presumed fault” by the carrier his agents or servants. Thus in cases of loss or damage to cargo the carrier is held to be liable unless he proves that he, his servants and agents were not at fault. Chapter Two: considers the scope of liability under the Hague/Visby Rules. They cover bills of lading which are issued in contracting state or which incorporate the Rules by paramount clause. They cover the international outward carriage only. While under Hamburg Rules it is immaterial whether or not a bill of lading has been issued. The Rules cover contract of carriage concluded in a contracting state or if the port of loading or port of discharge is in a contracting state. Moreover if the optional port of discharge is in a contracting state. Similarly, it can be incorporated by paramount clause in the bill of lading. Hamburg Rules cover the inward and outward international carriage. The period of application under the Hague/Visby Rules is limited from the time of loading till the time of discharge, i. e. “tackle to tackle” period, while Hamburg Rules cover the entire voyage until the goods are handed over or put in disposal of the cargo owner. The Hague/Visby Rules do not provide for liability in cases of delay in delivery. They exclude the live animals and deck cargo from the definition of goods. While Hamburg Rules provide for liability of carrier in cases of delay in delivery. They bring all cargoes under their umbrella. Thus they provide for liability of the carrier in cases of live animals and deck cargo. Both conventions provide for liability for shipment of dangerous cargoes. The well known doctrine of deviation under the common law is still in use under the Hague/Visby Rules. It operates to hold the carrier as in a fundamental breach of contract unless he proves that he deviates to save life or property at sea. Hamburg Rules do not recognize the doctrine of deviation. Chapter Three: considers the limits of liability and limits of actions. The same system of calculating the limit of liability is valid under both conventions, i. e. the dual system of per package, per kilo. The former is for goods with high value compared to their weight, while the latter is suitable for bulk cargoes. Although the Hague/Visby Rules introduce a provision for calculating limit of liability in containerized goods, i. e. according to the items enumerated on the bill of lading, the position is still ambiguous. The unit of account is Poincare franc which is replaced by the additional Protocol ١٩٧٩ by the Special Drawing Right (SDR) and so forth under Hamburg Rules. The limits should be broken when the carrier is in default of negligence, recklessness or intentional acts. Moreover, the carrier cannot be benefited by the limits of liability under the Hague/Visby Rules if he is in default i. e. in cases of fundamental breach of contract such as deviations or stowage on deck without shippers consent...|$|E

We refer to this phenomenon as moral alchemy and suggest that it arises because moral <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> entail recursively valuing loved ones’ values, thus allowing propositions with no moral weight in themselves to become morally charged. Within this framework, we predict that when people believe a loved one cares about a behavior {{more than they do}} themselves, the moral imperative to care about the loved one's interests will raise the value of that behavior, such that people {{will be more likely to}} infer that third parties will see the behavior as wrong (Experiment 1) and the behavior itself as more morally important (Experiment 2) than when the same behaviors are considered outside the context <b>of</b> a <b>caring</b> relationship.

A phenomenological methodology was used in this study, with the aim of gaining more understanding, firstly about what is experienced by Senior Citizens as beneficial and not beneficial in regards to support in general and secondly about the challenges of later stages of life from Senior Citizens’ perspective, especially without expected support of offspring. In-depth interviews were conducted with eight Jewish women, aged over 75, who find themselves in such a position. Their experiences are described in terms of social, practical, emotional and spiritual support as well as in terms of the contextual experiences that necessitate support. The overall experience was found to be one of managing aloneness and dealing with the loss of family and its accompanying sense of belonging. It includes constantly missing one’s family, trying to keep in satisfyingly regular contact and trying to comprehend, justify and accept their emigration in terms of expected intergenerational roles. It demands adjusting to constant changes in supports and in one’s independence and identity and finding the motivation to strive to remain alive and discover meaning in the painful situation. In the face of all this, there is also a discovery of previously unsuspected new strengths in being able to cope with these difficulties and an exciting new sense of liberation in catering only for oneself.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the various notions of community, {{and of the}} 'natural lottery' as well as investigating the role that 'self-causation' plays in communal obligations. In examining community, two opposing views are juxtaposed: (1) the view that community consists merely of persons united by duties of refraining from harm one to another, resulting in autonomy based justice which makes freedom an absolute condition of morality; and (2) a broader view which sees the concept of community as entailing <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> beneficence, resulting in beneficence based justice and which, therefore, sees freedom as a value to be cautiously traded with other values. In examining the 'natural lottery' {{in the light of}} community, the various consequences of viewing the lottery in various ways and the impact that our view of community has on these consequences, is explored. A third option, the option that the 'natural lottery' as the cause of illness and health is a shaky concept, is offered. Self-causation of illness and its linkage to concepts of community and of the 'natural lottery' is then briefly examined. It is concluded that (1) community implies a social contract which, in order to be conceived in the first place, necessitates more than a minimalist ethic: to come about, a degree of beneficence inspiring trust is presupposed; (2) conceiving community narrowly is neither what we ordinarily do when we think of the term nor, for that matter, workable in our world; (3) thinking of the 'natural lottery' as the main determinant of health or disease can be shown to be false: in our world, disease is, to a large degree at least, a social construct; and (4) blaming self-causation for many of today's illnesses has superficial merit but causation is far too complex to permit such a simplistic notion practical application (except, perhaps, that substances known to cause excess harm might be taxed and the tax used for health purposes). The paper concludes by affirming that <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> for the welfare of all members of the community (regardless of their contribution to their own misfortune), far more than duties of simply refraining from harm one to another, enables communities to survive. ...|$|R

After {{a consideration of the}} historical evolution and nature <b>of</b> the implied <b>obligations,</b> the standards <b>of</b> performance imposed under them at common law is considered before going on to how the peculiar nature <b>of</b> the <b>obligations</b> lead to modified results under the general contract law rules for the construction of exclusion clauses. The discussion proceeds to the standards <b>of</b> the <b>obligations</b> imposed on the carrier by the Hague and Hague-Visby Rules to exercise due diligence to make the vessel seaworthy and to properly and carefully carry the cargo. There is a consideration of the significance of the overriding, as well as the non-delegable nature <b>of</b> these <b>obligations.</b> In particular, whether or not a carrier whose breach <b>of</b> an implied <b>obligation</b> is a cause of the loss or damage to cargo, can rely on the exceptions provided by the Rules is considered in depth. The final sections of the thesis deal with the principles of causation and onus of proof applied in sea cargo claims and how they impact upon the interface between the implied obligations and exclusion clauses. The analysis of causation examines how liability is determined where the carrier's breach <b>of</b> an implied <b>obligation</b> co-operates with or is intervened upon by an excepted peril to produce the loss or damage to cargo. With respect to onus of proof, the issue considered is which party bears the legal burden on proof or disproof of the breach of an implied obligation: must the cargo owner establish affirmatively that the particular breach asserted caused his loss or is it for the carrier, as part of his defence, and claim for exemption from liability. to negative breach? The thesis advances two principal arguments. First, it is argued that because of the development <b>of</b> the implied <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> seaworthiness, <b>care</b> <b>of</b> cargo and non-deviation from route as important obligations which underlie the carriage contract, strict and utmost <b>care</b> standards <b>of</b> performance are imposed under them at common law and under the Hague-Visby Rules respectively. Secondly, it is argued that the result of these high standards of performance {{is that there is a}} "risk" approach to liability which explains the peculiar rules of construction, causation and onus of proof which import restriction on the effect of sea carriers' exclusion clauses.

Professor Kathleen Daly provides an overview; in her aptly titled essay, 2 ̆ 2 Gender and Sentencing: What We Know and Don 2 ̆ 7 t Know From Empirical Research, 2 ̆ 2 she reviews the literature (including data from her own studies) and discusses the difficulties of comparing women and men. Because gender is reflected in occupational status, role in offenses, and a host of other variables, it is difficult to determine what, if any, effects gender has, qua gender. As she puts it, 2 ̆ 2 [m]ost sentencing criteria are, in fact, gender-linked. 2 ̆ 2 The federal sentencing guidelines do not assume women are the 2 ̆ 2 presumptive subjects 2 ̆ 2 of sentencing; instead the prevailing assumption is that men are defendants. Norms of so-called 2 ̆ 2 neutrality 2 ̆ 2 are not in practice neutral because women and men are not currently similarly situated outside the criminal justice system. Daly finds that, while women and men are treated similarly in some respects, women and men with <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> for others (2 ̆ 2 familied women 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 familied men 2 ̆ 2) are not treated similarly...|$|R
5000|$|The occasionalism of Geulincx is ethical {{rather than}} cosmological in its inception. The first tract of his Ethics {{is a study}} of what in his terms are the {{cardinal}} virtues. Virtue according to Geulincx is the love of God and of Reason (III, 16-17; 29). The cardinal virtues are the properties of virtue which immediately flow from its very essence and {{have nothing to do}} with externals: diligence, obedience, justice, humility (III, 17). Humility divides his view of the world into two parts: one, the understanding of our relation to the world; and the other, the concept of our relation to God. Humility consists in the knowledge of self and the forsaking of self. I find in myself nothing that is my own but to know and to will. I therefore must be conscious of all that I do, and that of which I am not conscious is not the product of my own causality. Hence the universal principle of causality--quod nescis quo modo fiat, non facis—if you do not know how a thing is done then you do not do it. He also states a form of this principle in his Metaphysica vera. Since then, the movements of my body take place without my knowing how the nervous impulse passes to the muscles and there-causes them to contract I do not cause my own bodily actions. [...] "I am therefore a mere spectator of this machine. In it I form naught and renew naught, I neither make anything here nor destroy it. Everything is the work of someone else" [...] (III, 33). This one is the Deity who sees and knows all things. The second part of Geulincx's philosophy is connected with Occasionalism as the effect with the cause. Its guiding principle is: Where you can do nothing there also you should desire nothing (III, 222). This leads to a mysticism and asceticism which however must not be taken too seriously for it is tempered by the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> for the body and propagating the species.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: This {{case report}} aims {{to address the}} ethical issues and <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> {{enforcing}} medical <b>care</b> onto psychiatric patients under the Queensland Mental Health Act 2000 Involuntary Treatment Order (ITO), and will also present Queensland's legal standpoint and limitations on providing this care under the Act. Case Presentation: PF, a 47 year old male {{with a history of}} depression and recent diagnosis of Gleason 7 prostate cancer was admitted to the acute mental health unit following an intentional overdose of alprazolam. His risk to himself prompted the application of an ITO. Although PF was due for investigation of his recently diagnosed prostate cancer, he refused following his suicide attempt. Conclusion: Although an ITO allows for enforcement of psychiatric treatment, no legal allowances exist for enforcement <b>of</b> medical <b>care.</b> In situations where medical conditions may be indirectly detrimental to a person's mental health, ethically appropriate techniques should be employed...|$|R
40|$|This Monograph {{derives from}} {{research}} undertaken during my appointment as a Visiting Scholar at The Poynter Center for The Study of Ethics and American Institutions, Indiana University, Bloomington in July-August, 2000. The thesis of this Monograph is that before contemporary society can confront the issue <b>of</b> health <b>care</b> rationing for the elderly, it must seek {{to integrate the}} disciplines of moral and ethical reasoning with the qualitative formulations of needs and resources. Until such a point is reached, however, the greatest danger to avoid is the perpetuation of non-decisions regarding health care treatment. Such 2 ̆ 2 decisions 2 ̆ 2 all too frequently result in the non-treatment of elderly patients and institutional residents because of an inability to assess effectively the equitable and efficient allocation of the scarce health care resources which are available. The real moral question raised from this debate is not whether too much treatment or too little is offered. Rather, it is how to optimize {{the appropriateness of the}} treatment; and therein lies the moral <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> health <b>care</b> as well. However difficult or tragic the allocative decisions are to make, taking no action is perhaps the most pernicious conduct of all. Society must realize that aging is not a disease, but an inherent part of human life...|$|R
40|$|The {{ethical issues}} that are {{associated}} with interprofessional relationships in health care affect the care that patients receive in an institutional setting. There are many components of difference that affect relationships, but this work focuses on sexual difference and how it is revealed in the discourse <b>of</b> health <b>care.</b> Since the ethical <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> health <b>care</b> providers historically have been derived from the roles of those professionals, the patient and provider relationship is described to establish the <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> nurses, physical therapists, and physicians to patients. Because health care principles traditionally have been narrowly interpreted and applied, as well as limited in choosing ethical cases for analysis, the traditional ethical frameworks of principlism and casuistry have been insufficient in addressing the ethical concerns that arise from interprofessional relationships. A feminine ethic <b>of</b> <b>care</b> is also inadequate in addressing these concerns because it is not sensitive to sexual difference and because it involves the possibility of promoting self-sacrifice. Luce Irigaray uses a technique of mimesis to expose and undermine sexual indifference in several western texts to explain how woman's voice has been overlooked in a culture based on masculine discourse. Her phenomenological interpretation of woman's body as being fluid, multiple, and intermediate is associated with those health care professions that are grounded in maternal nurturing and touching. These qualities are also revealed in the gendered discourse that permeates health care. Using Irigaray's work on feminine imaginary and gendered discourse, health care ethical issues can be analyzed at a deeper level than via principlism, casuistry, or care. By recognizing how the gendered nature <b>of</b> health <b>care</b> discourse prevents the female voice from contributing to the decision-making process, new and creative possibilities for approaching ethical issues can be developed to provide the patient with care based on a broader interpretation of the issues. A case study based on a patient at the end-of-life is used to illustrate how the recognition of the role of sexual difference in ethical analysis can affect how decisions about patient care are made...|$|R
