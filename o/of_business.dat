40|$|This study investigates three {{important}} {{issues in a}} family business: (1) Whether {{there is a significant}} difference, relative to their goals and atti-tudes, between owners <b>of</b> <b>businesses</b> with family participation and owners <b>of</b> <b>businesses</b> without family participation; (2) whether owners <b>of</b> <b>businesses</b> with family participation perceive higher levels of business-family conflict than owners <b>of</b> <b>businesses</b> without family participation; and (3) whether owners <b>of</b> <b>businesses</b> with family participation view business-family conflict as a significant impediment to their business performance. We conducted a sur-vey <b>of</b> 231 small <b>business</b> owners in midsize cities in the northeastern and midwestern United States. Of the total sample, 118 are businesses in which two or more family members are employed. This study examines both the reported conflict and the positives of family-member involvement. The find-ings indicate that there is no overall difference in business-related goals be-tween the two groups, but that owners <b>of</b> <b>businesses</b> with family participation do experience significantly more business-family conflict. The study also con-cludes that this conflict is generally well managed and does not interfere with business objectives. In fact, the authors conclude that owners <b>of</b> <b>businesses</b> with family participation see the involvement of family members as a posi-tive. Managerial implications and research suggestions are also discussed...|$|R
