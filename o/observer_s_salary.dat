40|$|Excerpt] Salaries, promotions, {{and salary}} growth {{of men and}} women in a large, diversified firm were {{examined}} for the years 1980 through 1986. Consistent with other studies, men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> average <b>salary</b> was higher than women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> average <b>salary.</b> However, statistical adjustment for gender differences in-education, tenure, time at level, experience, and job level substantially reduced the salary advantage of men over women. Although the average salary of men was higher than that of women in 1980 and 1986, women actually received greater numbers of promotions, as well as larger percentage salary increases between 1980 and 1986. One reason for women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>salary</b> growth advantage was the higher average performance ratings of women between 1980 and 1986.

40|$|Forty-four Iowa {{school board}} presidents and superintendents {{from the same}} school districts were {{surveyed}} to investigate and analyze perceptions of {{the manner in which}} superintendents are currently being awarded salary increases and the preferred or ideal manner in which salary increases should be awarded. Secondly, a sample of board members, administrators, teachers, students, and support staff from these same forty-four school districts {{were asked to respond to}} a Perceived Quality instrument concerning a quality rating of the school districts. The results of these surveys were composed to determine whether a correlation existed between the current and ideal manner of awarding salary increases to superintendents and the perceived quality rating of the school. This study was implemented to test the theory of W. Edwards Deming that merit or performance will destroy the organization;The results of the study indicate the following conclusions in the current practice of awarding salary increases: (1) Board presidents and superintendents agreed that increases or decreases in student population have little effect in determining salary increases. (2) Board presidents and superintendents felt that teacher negotiated contract settlements have a large impact on the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>salary</b> increase. (3) Board presidents and superintendents agreed that standardized testing should not be used in determining salary increases. (4) Board presidents and, to a lesser degree, superintendents felt that the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 s performance on the job description has an impact on salary increases;In the ideal or preferred manner of awarding superintendent salary increases, the following was found: (1) Increase or decrease of student population should have little effect on salary increases. (2) Board presidents felt that the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>salary</b> increase should be related to the teacher negotiated contract settlement, while superintendents felt that the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>salary</b> increase should be separate from the teacher negotiated settlement. (3) Board presidents felt that the performance on the job description should be heavily considered for salary increases. Superintendents placed a significantly lower level of importance than do board presidents for compensation increases based upon job performance. Both board presidents and superintendents agreed that standardized test scores should not be a factor. (4) A slight negative correlation was found when comparing the perceived quality rating of a school district with performance-based pay for the superintendent.

Since loss of privacy means that we gain new information about a person, it seems natural to measure the loss of privacy by the amount of information that we gained.

French Calvinists present a unique and unstudied challenge to this narrative because much unlike other mainstream Protestants, the French Reformed Churches adopted John Calvin 2 ̆ 7 s ideas to the situation in France. Relying on the authority of their Christian religion, Huguenot leaders across France created a new fiscal policy in which they determined how much their members should pay and, using these funds in combination with the consistory, enforced what historians now call social discipline.
