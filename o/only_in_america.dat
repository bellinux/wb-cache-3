Norton was raised Episcopalian. He graduated in 1987 from Columbia's Wilde Lake High School, where his classmates included New York City Council member Mark Levine and best-selling author Robert Kolker. He attended Yale University, where he was a competitive rower and acted in university productions alongside Ron Livingston and Paul Giamatti, graduating in 1991 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in History. After graduation, Norton worked in Osaka, Japan, consulting for his grandfather's company, Enterprise Community Partners, and speaks some Japanese. He appeared in an EFL textbook, <b>Only</b> <b>in</b> <b>America,</b> used by Nova, a formerly major English language school in Japan. He moved to New York City to star in the Off-Broadway theater, breaking through with his 1993 involvement in Edward Albee's Fragments, at the Signature Theatre Company.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{features}} of this trade was the exchange of a great array of domesticated plants and animals between the Old World and the New and vice versa. Some that were introduced to America included wine, wheat, barley, apples, cattle, sheep, pigs, horses, donkeys, and many others. The Old World received from America such things as maize, potatoes, chili peppers, tomatoes, tobacco, beans, squash, cacao (chocolate), vanilla, avocados, pineapples, chewing gum, rubber, peanuts, cashews, Brazil nuts, pecans, blueberries, strawberries, quinoa, amaranth, chia, agave and so on. The result of these exchanges, known generally as the Columbian Exchange, was to significantly improve the agricultural potential of not <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>America,</b> but also that of Europe and Asia.|$|E

500|$|A more {{accurate}} biography of Poe {{did not appear}} until John Henry Ingram's of 1875. Even so, historians continued to use Griswold's depiction {{as a model for}} their own biographies of Poe, including W. H. Davenport in 1880, Thomas R. Slicer in 1909, and Augustus Hopkins Strong in 1916. Many used Poe as a cautionary tale against alcohol and drugs. In 1941, Arthur Hobson Quinn presented evidence that Griswold had forged and re-written a number of Poe's letters that were included in his [...] "Memoir of the Author". By then, Griswold's depiction of Poe was entrenched {{in the mind of the}} public, not <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>America</b> but around the world, and this distorted image of Poe has become part of the Poe legend despite attempts to dispel it.|$|E
500|$|In a February 11, 2011 Entertainment Weekly article, veteran script {{supervisor}} Sandy Schklair {{announced that}} he desired credit for directing The Room. Schklair told EW shortly after being hired on as script supervisor, Wiseau became too engrossed with his acting duties to direct the film properly; according to Schklair, Wiseau then asked him to [...] "tell the actors what to do, and yell 'Action' and 'Cut' and tell the cameraman what shots to get." [...] The script supervisor {{also said that he}} had a conversation with Wiseau in which he refused to give up the title of [...] "director", but asked Schklair to [...] "direct [...] movie." [...] The story is corroborated by {{at least one of the}} film's actors, who requested anonymity for the story. Wiseau has dismissed Schklair's comments. Greg Sestero's memoir The Disaster Artist about the making of The Room partially corroborates Schklair's version of events, describing him taking charge of numerous sequences in which Wiseau found himself unable to remember lines properly or adequately interact with the rest of the cast, but jokes that claiming directorial credit was like [...] "claiming to have been the Hindenburg's principal aeronautics engineer". Wiseau said of Schklair's assertion, [...] "Well, this is so laughable that… you know what? I don’t know, probably <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>America</b> it can happen, this kind of stuff." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Rula Jebreal, a Palestinian {{journalist}} {{and foreign policy}} analyst, Ayaan Hirsi Ali's criticism applies mostly to [...] "Wahhabism", the strain of Islam most familiar to Hirsi Ali, and not to Islam as a whole. Jebreal added that Ali's [...] "outbursts" [...] are originated from her own pains, [...] "physical scars inflicted on her body during childhood," [...] which were justified by a radical version of the religion into which she was born. Jebreal wrote: [...] " [...] To endorse Hirsi Ali so unabashedly is to insult and mock a billion Muslims". [...] "It's {{time to listen to}} what is being said by the Muslim voices of peace and tolerance. Ayaan Hirsi Ali is not one of them," [...] she added.

[...] The single charted at number seven on the UK Singles Chart, which gained the band their eleventh top ten single. It was announced that The Saturdays had signed to Island Def Jam and Mercury Records to release future music in the United States.

I should, too, call it a signal instance of democratic humanity's luck that it has such enemies to contend with--so candid, so fervid, so heroic. But why do I say enemies? Upon the whole is not Tennyson--and was not Carlyle (like an honest and stern physician)--the true friend of our age? ...|$|E

6000|$|It is <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>America</b> that {{precisely}} such {{a success}} as Garfield's {{is possible for}} people who spring, as he did, from {{the midst of the}} people. In old-settled and wealthy countries we must be content, at best, with slower and less lofty promotion. But the lesson of Garfield's life is not for America only, but for the whole world of workers everywhere. The same qualities which procured his success there will produce a different, but still a solid success, anywhere else. As Garfield himself fittingly put it, with his usual keen American common sense, [...] "There is no more common thought among young people than the foolish one, that by-and-by something will turn up by which they will suddenly achieve fame or fortune. No, young gentlemen; things don't turn up in this world unless somebody turns them up." ...|$|E
60|$|The great {{deliverer}} King William the Third, to whom Lord Marney was {{a systematic}} traitor, made the {{descendant of the}} Ecclesiastical Commissioner of Henry the Eighth an English earl; and from that time until the period of our history, though the Marney family had never produced one individual eminent for civil or military abilities, though the country was not indebted to them for a single statesman, orator, successful warrior, great lawyer, learned divine, eminent author, illustrious man of science, they had contrived, if not to engross any great share of public admiration and love, at least to monopolise no contemptible portion of public money and public dignities. During the seventy years of almost unbroken whig rule, from the accession of the House of Hanover to the fall of Mr Fox, Marney Abbey had furnished a never-failing crop of lord privy seals, lord presidents, and lord lieutenants. The family had had their due quota of garters and governments and bishoprics; admirals without fleets, and generals who fought <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>America.</b> They had glittered in great embassies with clever secretaries at their elbow, and had once governed Ireland when to govern Ireland was only to apportion the public plunder to a corrupt senate.|$|E
60|$|From 1857 to 1861, Garfield {{remained}} at Hiram, teaching and working very hard. His salary, though {{a good one}} for the time and place, was still humble according to our English notions; but it sufficed for his needs; and as yet it would have seemed hardly credible that in only twenty years the Ohio schoolmaster would rise to be President of the United States. Indeed, it is <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>America,</b> that country of peculiarly unencumbered political action, where every kind of talent is most rapidly recognized and utilized, that this particular form of swift promotion is really possible. But while Garfield was still at his Institute, {{he was taking a}} vigorous part in local politics, especially on the slavery question. Whenever there was a political meeting at Hiram, the young schoolmaster was always called upon to take the anti-slavery side; and he delivered himself so effectively upon this favourite topic that he began to be looked upon as a rising political character. In America, politics are less confined to any one class than in Europe; and there would be nothing unusual in the selection of a schoolmaster who could talk to a seat in the local or general legislature. The practice of paying members makes it possible for comparatively poor men to offer themselves as candidates; and politics are thus a career, {{in the sense of a}} livelihood, far more than in any other country.|$|E

60|$|Before {{examining}} {{this opinion}} {{on grounds of}} principle, it is worth while to bestow a moment’s consideration upon it as a question of fact. Is it true that the wages of manufacturing labor are lower in foreign countries than in England, in any sense in which low wages are an advantage to the capitalist? The artisan of Ghent or Lyons may earn less wages in a day, but does he not do less work? Degrees of efficiency considered, does his labor cost less to his employer? Though wages may be lower on the Continent, is not the Cost of Labor, which is the real element in the competition, very nearly the same? That it is so seems the opinion of competent judges, and is confirmed by the very little difference {{in the rate of}} profit between England and the Continental countries. But, if so, the opinion is absurd that English producers can be undersold by their Continental rivals from this cause. It is <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>America</b> that the supposition is prima facie admissible. In America wages are much higher than in England, if we mean by wages the daily earnings of a laborer; but the productive power of American labor is so great—its efficiency, combined with the favorable circumstances in which it is exerted, makes it worth so much to the purchaser—that the Cost of Labor is lower in America than in England; as is proved {{by the fact that the}} general rate of profits and of interest is very much higher.|$|E
60|$|If {{we leave}} this {{question}} apart, I {{think it will}} be the experience of the careful observer that there is a summit of healthful looks in England, which we do not touch in America, whatever the large table-land or foot-hill average we reach; and in like manner there is an exceptional distinction of presence as one encounters it, rarely enough, in the London streets, which one never encounters with us. I am not envying the one, or at least not regretting the other. Distinction is the one thing for which I think humanity certainly pays too much; <b>only,</b> <b>in</b> <b>America,</b> we pay too much for too many other things to take any great comfort in our want of distinction. I own the truth without grief or shame, while I enjoy the sight of distinction in England as I enjoy other spectacles for which I cannot help letting the English pay too much. I was not appreciably the poorer myself, perhaps I was actually the richer, in seeing, one fine chill Sunday afternoon, in the aristocratic region where I was taking my walk, the encounter of an elderly gentleman and lady who bowed to each other on the pavement before me, and then went and came their several ways. In him I saw that his distinction was passive and resided largely in his drab spats, but hers I beheld active, positive, as she marched my way with the tall cane that helped her steps, herself tall in proportion, with a head, ashen gray, held high, and a straight well-fitted figure dressed in such keeping that there was nothing for the eye to dwell on in her various black. She looked not only authoritative; people often do that with us; she looked authorized; she had been empowered by the vested rights and interests to look so her whole life; one could not be mistaken in her, any more than in the black trees and their electric-green buds in the high-fenced square, or in the vast, high, heavy, handsome houses where, in the cellary or sepulchral cold, she would presently resume the rheumatic pangs of which the comparative warmth of the outer air had momentarily relieved her stately bulk.|$|E
6000|$|This romance was Transformation, {{which he}} wrote out during the {{following}} winter in Rome, and re-wrote during the several months that he spent in England, chiefly at Leamington, before returning to America. The Villa Montauto figures, in fact, in this tale as the castle of Monte-Beni, the patrimonial dwelling of the hero. [...] "I take some credit to myself," [...] he wrote to the same friend, on returning to Rome, [...] "for having sternly shut myself up {{for an hour or}} two every day, and come to close grips with a romance which I have been trying to tear out of my mind." [...] And later in the same winter he says--"I shall go home, I fear, with a heavy heart, not expecting to be very well contented there.... If I were but a hundred times richer than I am, how very comfortable I could be! I consider it a great piece of good fortune that I have had experience of the discomforts and miseries of Italy, and did not go directly home from England. Anything will seem like a Paradise after a Roman winter." [...] But he got away at last, late in the spring, carrying his novel with him, and the book was published, after, as I say, he had worked it over, mainly during some weeks that he passed at the little watering-place of Redcar, on the Yorkshire coast, in February of the following year. It was issued primarily in England; the American edition immediately followed. It is an odd fact that in the two countries the book came out under different titles. The title that the author had bestowed upon it did not satisfy the English publishers, who requested him to provide it with another; so that it is <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>America</b> that the work bears the name of The Marble Fawn. Hawthorne's choice of this appellation is, by the way, rather singular, for it completely fails to characterise the story, the subject of which is the living faun, the faun of flesh and blood, the unfortunate Donatello. His marble counterpart is mentioned only in the opening chapter. On the other hand Hawthorne complained that Transformation [...] "gives one the idea of Harlequin in a pantomime." [...] Under either name, however, the book was a great success, and it has probably become the most popular of Hawthorne's four novels. It is part of the intellectual equipment of the Anglo-Saxon visitor to Rome, and is read by every English-speaking traveller who arrives there, who has been there, or who expects to go.|$|E
