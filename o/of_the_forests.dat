5|$|The {{network of}} roads and railroads that the {{division}} had built allowed for future development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forests,</b> which facilitated {{the growth of}} the lumber industry in the Pacific Northwest {{for the remainder of the}} 20thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Cherry Springs State Park and the {{surrounding}} Susquehannock State Forest have recovered from the clearcutting of the lumber era. However, the composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> has changed, {{so that there are}} now more hardwoods, including sugar maple and black cherry, and fewer eastern white pine and eastern hemlock. The park also has apple trees from the CCC orchard. Over 400species of birds have been found in Pennsylvania, including 186that breed in the state. Birds such as ospreys, hawks, owls, nightjars, and bald eagles have returned to the park and state forest, and saw-whet owls have been studied in the park.|$|E
5|$|The {{availability}} of food reflects the seasonal nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> {{in which they}} live. During the hot season, fruit, flowers, and young leaves are more abundant, whereas the cold, wet season offers more young leaves and flowers. Despite this, the diet changes little between seasons, except that females will consume more high-protein, low-fiber items, such as young leaves and flowers, during pregnancy and lactation in order to offset the energy costs of reproduction. Nectar is only available sporadically, yet constitutes a major food source when the flowers bloom. The nectar of the traveller's palm (Ravenala madagascariensis) is a favorite among ruffed lemurs.|$|E
50|$|The {{topography}} generally slopes {{toward the}} south with four major topographical features dominating <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b> Sun Mountain in <b>the</b> northeast corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> and Sand Ridge on <b>the</b> <b>forest’s</b> northern border are highly visible features. <b>The</b> eastern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> {{is dominated by}} a large pumice plain while lava flows are the main feature in the northwest. In addition, two year-around creeks shape <b>the</b> character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b> Sun Creek runs through <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest,</b> and over time, has cut a small canyon through <b>the</b> <b>forest’s</b> central plains.

5|$|The early European {{economy of}} the Catlins during the 1830s and 1840s centred on whaling and sealing. The {{exploitation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> for timber started in the 1860s with {{the rapid growth of}} the city of Dunedin {{as a result of the}} goldrush of 1861–62. In the early 1870s more timber cargo was loaded at Owaka than at any other New Zealand port. Forestry and sawmilling declined in the late 1880s once the easily accessible timber had been removed. The extension of the railway beyond Owaka breathed new life into these industries, however, with activity peaking during the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his success}} in winning the war, William had far less success in {{restoring}} royal power following the peace. In part, this was because William was unable to offer significant patronage, despite the expectations from the loyalist barons {{that they would be}} rewarded. William attempted to enforce the traditional rights of the Crown to approve marriages and wardships, but with little success. Nonetheless, William was able to reconstitute the royal bench of judges and reopen the royal exchequer. The government issued the Charter of the Forest, which attempted to reform the royal governance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forests.</b> The regency and Llywelyn came to agreement on the Treaty of Worcester in 1218, but its generous terms – Llywelyn became effectively Henry's justiciar across Wales – underlined the weakness of the English Crown.|$|E
5|$|Emerald, Pandour, and Drake {{then pushed}} up the river, {{sometimes}} in less water than the frigates required to float properly, until on 5 May they arrived {{close to the}} forts Leyden and Frederici. The British landed a detachment of troops under Hughes some distance away, which marching under the cover <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> and swamps, launched an attack {{that resulted in the}} swift capture of the two forts. By this time, most of the squadron had managed to work its way up the river as far as Frederici, Maitland was advancing along the Commewine River, and with troops poised to attack the fort of New Amsterdam, the Batavian commandant, Lieutenant-Colonel Batenburg, duly surrendered.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> soils <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> at <b>the</b> Vorskla {{developed}} on different parent materials, {{especially on the}} loam, which is found in <b>the</b> eastern half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b> In <b>the</b> northwestern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> and old Alluviumsande play a role. They are distributed on <b>the</b> river terraces <b>of</b> Gotnja and Loknja. At the southern and south-eastern edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> a oligozänischer Sandy loam is common parent rock. In some places in <b>the</b> southern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest,</b> a rust-colored sound comes out. The oligozänische Sandy loam and the rust-colored clay are there starting materials of soil formation, where erosion has removed the Loess. Under the oligozänischen clay are rocks from the Cretaceous, which do not appear on the surface in <b>the</b> territory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{topography}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> {{varies from}} rolling upland sites to extensive swamps {{in the southern}} and northeastern portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b> <b>The</b> <b>forest</b> is divided between two watersheds: the Willow River and Lower Tamarack River along with <b>the</b> southern two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest,</b> eventually feed into the St. Croix River, whereas, the numerous streams in the northern one-third portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> lead to Lake Superior. <b>The</b> area's old-growth <b>forest</b> was logged throughout the nineteenth century, with the Willow, Tamarack, and Nemadji Rivers being used to drive logs down the St. Croix to sawmills in Stillwater. <b>The</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> came under <b>the</b> ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state after tax forfeitures in the early 1900s.|$|R

Thranduil claimed <b>the</b> {{northern}} regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> as far south as the mountains in <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> (<b>the</b> Emyn Duir), and Celeborn took <b>the</b> southern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> below <b>the</b> Narrows, calling it East Lórien.|$|R
5|$|In 1860, a {{much closer}} gold rush {{occurred}} in the San Bernardino Mountains when prospector William Holcomb discovered significant deposits, just over the northern drainage divide of the Santa Ana River. This discovery exploded into a full-scale gold mining operation in days. The Santa Ana River served as a conduit for miners traveling to the region and many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> in the upper basin experienced clearcutting {{as a result of}} the high resource demands of the boom. Gold was also discovered in Lytle Creek in that same year. Following the gold rush, the cultivation of citrus became the mainstay of the economy of the lower Santa Ana River area. Through the late 19th century, citrus fields covered much of the coastal plain and led to the naming of Orange County.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Bauer {{was asked}} by the Åhlén & Åkerlund {{publishing}} house (now Bonnier Group) to illustrate their new series of books, Among Gnomes and Trolls. The books would be published annually, and contain stories by prominent Swedish authors. The majority of Bauer's pictures for the book were full-page watercolor illustrations in a muted color scheme; he also contributed with covers, vignettes and other smaller illustrations. Bauer's most significant creatures, the trolls, were rendered in shades of gray, green, and brown, the colors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forests,</b> as if these beings had grown from the landscape itself. Due to the limitiations of the technology available to his printers, the 1907–10 editions were produced in just two colors: black and yellow. Some of Bauer's original paintings for these prints were in full color.|$|E
5|$|In total, 415 {{types of}} plants and 86 species of {{mushroom}} are recorded in the area. A number of local flower types are considered endemic to the Balkans, such as Dianthus deltoides and Allium breviradum. On the other hand, many endemic plants of central and northern Greece grow also in the park, like the Centaurea vlachorum. Moreover, rare species <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> of Pindus mountains, typical of the lower geological layers, are Minuartia baldaci, Bornmuellera tymphaea, Campanula hawkinsiana, Viola dukadjinica and Silene pindicola. The most important places for the gathering of rare plants are the northern slopes of the peaks of Aftia, Flegga and Kapetan Kleidi. All the above places are very steep and difficult for grazing animals and therefore natural regeneration of the forest {{in this area is}} progressing normally and many rare plants are conserved. The serpentine soil, which is dominant {{in the area of the}} Pindus National Park also favors the growing of rare endemic plant species.|$|E

5|$|Its name {{derives from}} potlatch, {{a type of}} {{ceremony}} held by the indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest; one such tribe lived along the river {{for hundreds of years}} before the arrival of whites. Pioneers settled the watershed and established farms and ranches in the late 19th century. After that, logging eliminated most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> within the watershed and the ecology of the river is {{still in the process of}} recovery. Fishing, hiking and camping are popular recreational activities on the river; 14 percent the watershed lies on public lands. Before logging and agriculture, many varieties of riparian and forest plants once populated the catchment, and several species of fish still swim the river and its tributaries.|$|E
5|$|Mouflon (Ovis aries orientalis) was {{introduced}} from 1962–1964, {{and a plan}} to release axis deer (Axis axis) in 1964 was prevented only by protests from the ranching industry, who {{said that they would}} damage crops and spread disease. The hunting industry fought back, and the back-and-forth between the ranchers and hunters eventually gave way to a rise in public environmental concern. With the development of astronomical facilities on Mauna Kea commencing, conservationists demanded protection of Mauna Kea's ecosystem. A plan was proposed to fence 25% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> for protection, and manage the remaining 75% for game hunting. Despite opposition from conservationists the plan was put into action. While the land was partitioned no money was allocated for the building of the fence. In the midst of this wrangling the Endangered Species Act was passed; the National Audubon Society and Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund filed a lawsuit against the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, claiming that they were violating federal law, in the landmark case Palila v. Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources (1978).|$|E
5|$|Strandzha Nature Park was {{established}} on 25 January 1995 to protect ecosystems and biodiversity, {{as well as}} the traditional cultural, historical and folklore heritage of the region. Before 1995 the protection of the region had been fragmented, consisting of isolated nature reserves and protected areas. The park is administered by a directorate based in Malko Tarnovo and subordinated to the Executive Forest Agency of the Ministry of Environment and Water of Bulgaria. The directorate implements the state policy for the management and control of the protected area, aiming at the long-term conservation of the unique nature and ensuring the sustainable social and economic development of the region. It monitors the management and conservation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forests,</b> game, and fish resources while encouraging tourism and environmental protection.|$|E
30|$|Research on <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> {{dynamics}} <b>of</b> native araucarian forests {{is still}} incipient, mainly because most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> fragments are poorly structured. To {{gain a better}} understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> dynamics, growth models have been developed to evaluate the structure and composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> over time. These powerful tools can be used to explore how <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> will change in response to adversity and stand conditions (Newton 2007).|$|R
50|$|The area {{harvested}} {{each year}} translates to 0.4% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> area in British Columbia, and 0.8% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> {{area that is}} suitable for harvesting.|$|R

5|$|The {{climate of}} Strandzha is {{influenced}} by the proximity of the Black, Marmara and Aegean seas which clearly distinguishes the local climate from that of the rest of Bulgaria. The region is among the warmest in the country with temperatures rarely falling below 0°C in winter and rising above 24°C in summer due to the cooling effect of the Black Sea. The average temperature drops with the rising elevation in the interior which creates conditions for more frequent and longer-lasting mists, heavier snowfall and earlier frosts. In winter frequent fogs lead to hard rime and the icing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> at altitudes above 50.|$|E
5|$|The {{headwaters}} of the Snake River and the high mountains elsewhere in the watershed were historically heavily forested. These include aspen, Douglas fir, and spruce fir, comprising about 20% of the historic watershed. At the base of mountains and in the Lost River basin, sagebrush was and is the predominant vegetation cover. Because of deforestation, up to one quarter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> have {{been taken over by}} sagebrush, leaving the remaining forests to cover about 15% of the watershed. However, the lodgepole pine has increased in number, taking over historic stands of other conifers. There are also up to 118 species of rare or endemic plants that occur in the Snake River watershed.|$|E
5|$|Tree {{trunks and}} {{branches}} are ornamented with {{many species of}} ferns, Lycopodium, lichens, and orchids. Old man's beard (Usnea barbata) hanging from branches adds to the beauty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forests.</b> About 16 of the orchid species being endemic. Other notable plants include shrubs such as Rhodomyrtus tomentosa, Gaultheria fragrantissima, herbs, Exacum trinervium, E. walkeri, Drosera indica, and tree ferns Cyathea spp. Anzia, a foliose lichen genus belonging to Parmeliaceae family, which had not been recorded in Sri Lanka before, was discovered here in 2007. There are conflicting views on how the grasslands of the park came into being, whether man-made or natural. It is now believed that the grasslands on the dry slopes were created by forest clearance and fires while grasslands in low-lying areas were naturally created by wet conditions, frost and soil erosion.|$|E

5|$|Vikos-Aoös also {{contains}} a variety of suitable habitats that support dense populations of amphibians and reptiles. Vipera ursinii lives in the subalpine meadows and is considered a threatened taxon. The amphibian alpine newts (Triturus alpestris), living in the alpine lakes of the Tymfi region, mostly in Drakolimni, are associated with local folktales of dragons and dragon battles. Yellow-bellied toads (Bombina variegata) are also common in that same area. Numerous fish, such as brown trout, roach, and barbel {{are to be found}} in the park's rivers. Regarding invertebrate species, due to the structural complexity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> and the co-existence of various small biotopes, i.e. streams, ponds, forest openings, rocky sites, dead trees, old pollards, and coppices, a very diverse fauna exists. This occurs especially at the various ecotones, including often very specialized species.|$|E
5|$|Belgium {{continued}} to rule Ruanda-Urundi (of which Rwanda formed the northern part) as a UN Trust Territory after the Second World War, with {{a mandate to}} oversee eventual independence. Tension escalated between the Tutsi, who favoured early independence, and the Hutu emancipation movement, culminating in the 1959 Rwandan Revolution: Hutu activists began killing Tutsi and destroying their houses, forcing more than 100,000 people to seek refuge in neighbouring countries. In 1961, the suddenly pro-Hutu Belgians held a referendum in which the country voted to abolish the monarchy. Rwanda was separated from Burundi and gained independence in 1962. Cycles of violence followed, with exiled Tutsi attacking from neighbouring countries and the Hutu retaliating with large-scale slaughter and repression of the Tutsi. In 1973, Juvénal Habyarimana took power in a military coup. Pro-Hutu discrimination continued, but there was greater economic prosperity and a reduced amount of violence against Tutsi. The Twa remained marginalised, and by 1990 were almost entirely forced out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> by the government; many became beggars. Rwanda's population had increased from 1.6million people in 1934 to 7.1million in 1989, leading to competition for land.|$|E
5|$|Neville was {{appointed}} as Chief Forester under King Richard I in 1198. As the official {{in charge of}} the royal forests, he held one of the four great offices of the state: the others were the justiciar, the chancellor, and the treasurer. The forester was responsible for enforcing the forest law– the special law that applied to the royal forests– and presided over the forest justices, who held forest eyres. There was also a special forest exchequer, or forest treasury. In 1198 Neville presided over an Assize of the Forest that was described by the chronicler Roger of Howden as greatly oppressive. The revenues could be considerable; in 1198 the forest eyre brought in £1,980. Neville stated in 1208 that over the previous {{six and a half years}} the amount raised by the various revenues <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> had been £15,000; in 1212 it had been £4,486. Forest law was resented by the king's subjects, not just for its severity but also because of the large extent of the kingdom that it encompassed. It covered not just woodlands, but by the end of the 12th century between a quarter and a third of the whole kingdom. This extent enabled the Norman and Angevin kings to use the harsh punishments of forest law to extract large sums of money for their government.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{eastern end}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> is bordered by the Tăietura Turcului, an {{artificial}} valley that divides {{the hill from}} north to south and contains a traffic road. <b>The</b> west end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> reaches <b>the</b> northeastern slope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dealul Melcilor, nearby <b>the</b> Mujai <b>Forest,</b> which extends further westward.
