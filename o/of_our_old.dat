25|$|In Spring 1916 the {{division}} {{was moved to}} the Vimy Ridge sector near Arras. This was quiet to begin with, but in April intensive mining operations were begun by both sides, and on 20 May the Germans attacked and took some ground from {{the division}}. The 1/21st and 1/24th Bns counter-attacked on the evening of 23 May. The 1/24th was held up, but A Company of the First Surreys went ahead and recaptured the old line, holding it for about an hour and causing heavy casualties to the enemy. However, they were unsupported by flanking forces and were compelled to return: 'Nothing was left to show for this gallant and costly action beyond a few yards <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>old</b> front line'. To hold its position against German counter-attack {{at the end of the}} action, the battalion had to be reinforced by a company of the 1/22nd Londons, by the divisional engineers and pioneers and by the tunnelling companies. The First Surreys suffered 187 casualties of all ranks in this action.|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} with TSR, Gygax had often {{mentioned}} the mysterious Castle Greyhawk which formed the centre of his own home campaign. But despite all of his written output over the previous 30 years, Gygax had never published details of the castle. In 2003, Gygax {{announced that he was}} again partnering with Rob Kuntz to publish the original and previously unpublished details of Castle Greyhawk and the City of Greyhawk in 6 volumes, although the project would use the rules for Castles and Crusades rather than D. As Gygax wrote in an on-line forum: [...] "I have laid out a new schematic of castle and dungeon levels based on both my original design of 13 levels plus side adjuncts, and the 'New Greyhawk Castle' that resulted when Rob and I combined our efforts and added a lot of new levels too. From that Rob will draft the level plans for the newest version of the work. Meantime, I am collecting all the most salient feature, encounters, tricks, traps, etc. for inclusion on the various levels. So the end result will be what is essentially the best <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>old</b> work in a coherent presentation usable by all DMs, the material having all the known and yet to be discussed features of the original work that are outstanding... I hope." [...] Since Wizards of the Coast, which had bought TSR in 1997, still owned the rights to the name [...] "Greyhawk", Gygax changed the name of Castle Greyhawk to [...] "Castle Zagyg", a reverse homophone of his own name, and also changed the name of the nearby city to [...] "Yggsburgh", a play on his initials [...] "E.G.G." ...|$|E

2500|$|Betjeman {{responded to}} {{architecture}} as the visible manifestation of society's spiritual {{life as well}} as its political and economic structure. He attacked speculators and bureaucrats for what he saw as their rapacity and lack of imagination. In the preface of his collection of architectural essays First and Last Loves he says, [...] "We accept the collapse of the fabrics <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>old</b> churches, the thieving of lead and objects from them, the commandeering and butchery of our scenery by the services, the despoiling of landscaped parks and the abandonment to a fate worse than the workhouse of our country houses, because we are convinced we must save money." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pavel Annenkov {{considered}} Ioann and Fyodor as [...] "loosely based upon" [...] characters, being {{perfectly fine}} {{but only in}} representing their era, not their own historical selves. [...] "They are as loose as King Lear or Hamlet were and, if they do belong more to Russian history than those two belong to English history, that is because no other reality than that <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>Old</b> Russia could have inspired [...] in such a way, bringing him such colors, such an essence to freely draw from," [...] the critic wrote. It was the generic closeness of Tolstoy's plays to the Russia of old, Annenkov argued, that made them historic in the truest sense of the word, for [...] "their significance as living testimony to the spirit those people and their times is beyond doubt".|$|E
2500|$|The {{small village}} of Loxley, now {{a suburb of}} western Sheffield, lies within Hallamshire. A 1637 survey by John Harrison of the estates in or near Sheffield {{belonging}} to the Earl of Arundel states that a place called little Haggas croft in Loxley Firth contained [...] "the foundacion of a house or cottage where Robin Hood was born". Antiquarian Joseph Hunter—writing in 1819—reaffirmed this local tradition, stating that Loxley Chase has [...] "the fairest pretensions to be the Locksley <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>old</b> ballads, where was born that redoubtable hero Robin Hood." [...] In many legends Robin Hood {{is said to have}} been a displaced son of the lord of Hallamshire, who at this period in history resided at his manor at Loxley. This also ties in with the traditional idea of Robin Hood being related to Scottish nobility, if not distantly, because the lords of Hallamshire were descendants of the early medieval kings of Scotland through the Earl of Huntingdon.|$|E

2500|$|At 11:00a.m. on 28 July, Austria {{declared}} war on Serbia. Following instructions from Bethmann Hollweg, von Tschirschky did not present Wilhelm’s [...] "Stop in Belgrade" [...] proposal until noon. At 1:00am on 29 July 1914 the first shots of the First World War were fired by the Austrian monitor SMS Bodrog, which bombarded Belgrade in response to Serbian sappers blowing up the railway bridge over the river Sava which linked the two countries. In Russia, partial mobilization was ordered for the four military districts bordering Austria-Hungary. Wilhelm sent a telegram to Nicholas asking for Russian support for the Austrian war against Serbia. Nicholas replied: [...] "Am glad you are back... I appeal to you to help me. An ignoble war has been declared on a weak country... Soon I shall be overwhelmed by pressure brought upon me... to take extreme measures which will lead to war.
