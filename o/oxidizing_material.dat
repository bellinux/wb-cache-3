As part of a closure plan for an old unlined landfill without any gas management measures, an innovative biocover system was established. The system was designed based on a conceptual model of the gas emission patterns established through an initial baseline study. The study included construction of gas collection trenches along {{the slopes of the}} landfill where the majority of the methane emissions occurred. Local compost materials were tested as to their usefulness as bioactive methane <b>oxidizing</b> <b>material</b> and a suitable compost mixture was selected. Whole site methane emission quantifications based on combined tracer release and downwind measurements in combination with several local experimental activities (gas composition within biocover layers, flux chamber based emission measurements and logging of compost temperatures) proved that the biocover system had an average mitigation efficiency of approximately 80 %. The study showed that the system also had a high efficiency during winter periods with temperatures below freezing. An economic analysis indicated that the mitigation costs of the biocover system were competitive to other existing greenhouse gas mitigation options. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Possible {{interpretations of}} the results of the Viking Biology Experiments suggest that greater than 1 ppm of a {{thermally}} labile oxidant, perhaps H 2 O 2, and about 10 ppm of a thermally stable oxidant are present in the martian soil. We reexamine these results and discuss implications for future missions, the search for organics on Mars, and the possible health and engineering effects for human exploration. We conclude that further characterization of the reactivity of the martian regolith materials is warrented-although if our present understanding is correct the oxidant does not pose a hazard to humans. There are difficulties in explaining the reactivity of the Martian soil by oxidants. Most bulk phase compounds that are capable of oxidizing H 2 O to O 2 per the Gas Exchange Experiment (GEx) are thermally labile or unstable against reduction by atmospheric CO 2. Models invoking trapped O 2 or peroxynitrates (NOO 2 (-)) require an unlikely geologic history for the Viking Lander 2 site. Most suggested oxidants, including H 2 O 2, are expected to decompose rapidly under martian UV. Nonetheless, we conclude that the best model for the martian soil contains oxidants produced by heterogeneous chemical reactions with a photochemically produced atmospheric oxidant. The GEx results may be due to catalytic decomposition of an unstable <b>oxidizing</b> <b>material</b> by H 2 O.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} Pacific Northwest Laboratory`s {{fiscal year}} (FY) 1995 progress toward {{developing and implementing}} methods to identify and quantify cyanide species in ferrocyanide tank waste. This work was conducted for Westinghouse Hanfbrd Company`s (WHC`s) Ferrocyanide Safety Program. Currently, there are 18 high-level waste storage tanks at the US Department of Energy`s Hanford Site that are on a Ferrocyanide Tank Watchlist because they contain an estimated 1000 g-moles or more of precipitated ferrocyanide. In the presence of <b>oxidizing</b> <b>material</b> such as sodium nitrate or nitrite, ferrocyanide {{can be made to}} react exothermally by heating it to high temperatures or by applying an electrical spark of sufficient energy (Cady 1993). However, fuel, oxidizers, and temperature are all important parameters. If fuel, oxidizers, or high temperatures (initiators) are not present in sufficient amounts, then a runaway or propagating reaction cannot occur. To bound the safety concern, methods are needed to definitively measure and quantitate ferrocyanide concentration present within the actual waste. The target analyte concentration for cyanide in waste is approximately 0. 1 to 15 wt % (as cyanide) in the original undiluted sample. After dissolution of the original sample and appropriate dilutions, the concentration range of interest in the analytical solutions can vary between 0. 001 to 0. 1 wt % (as cyanide). In FY 1992, 1993, and 1994, two solution (wet) methods were developed based on Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and ion chromatography (IC); these methods were chosen for further development activities.

In spite of this, the potential valuable application prospect still inspired scientists to devote themselves to mimicking the distinctive surface nanostructure of butterfly wings. The colorful butterfly wing surface has been fabricated using soft lithography technique [28], low-temperature atomic layer deposition [29], colloidal self-assembly, sputtering and atomic layer deposition, even combining all these layer deposition techniques together [30].

Few researchers showed solicitude for the bionic fabricating of the super light trapping architectures in butterfly wings.

40|$|A {{discovery}} Unreviewed Safety Question (USQ) {{was declared}} on the underground waste storage tanks at the Hanford Site in May 1996. The USQ was for condensed-phase organic-nitrate reactions (sometimes called organic complexant reactions) in the tanks. This paper outlines the steps taken {{to close the}} USQ, and resolve the related safety issue. Several processes were used at the Hanford Site to extract and/or process plutonium. These processes resulted in organic complexants (for chelating multivalent cations) and organic extraction solvents {{being sent to the}} underground waste storage tanks. This paper addresses the organic complexant hazard. The organic complexants are in waste matrices that include inert material, diluents, and potential oxidizers. In the presence of <b>oxidizing</b> <b>material,</b> the complexant salts can be made to react exothermically by heating to high temperatures or by applying an external ignition source of sufficient energy. The first organic complexant hazard assessments focused on determining whether a hulk runaway reaction could occur, similar to the 1957 accident at Kyshtm (a reprocessing plant in the former U. S. S. R.). Early analyses (1977 through 1994) examined organic-nitrate reaction onset temperatures and concluded that a bulk runaway reaction could not occur at the Hanford Site because tank temperatures were well below that necessary for bulk runaway. Therefore, it was believed that organic-nitrate reactions were adequately described in the then current Authorization Basis (AB). Subsequent studies examined a different accident scenario, propagation resulting from an external ignition source (e. g., lightning or welding slag) that initiates a combustion front that propagates through the organic waste. A USQ evaluation determined that localized high energy ignition sources were credible, and that point source ignition of organic complexant waste was not adequately addressed i n the then existing AB. Consequently, the USQ was declared on the underground storage tanks in May 1996 for condensed-phase organic-nitrate reactions. At {{the same time that the}} operating contractor recommended that the U. S.

The analysis of WS 2 and WS 2 -based films by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) can be challenging, due to contamination and <b>oxidized</b> <b>material</b> on the surface. The investigations have traditionally therefore included sputter etching by ion bombardment, which however leads to changes of the remaining material.

High-resolution reference measurements for crystalline WS 2 and metallic W are also presented. The W–S films were analyzed before and after sputter cleaning by Ar+ ion bombardment, using photon energies of 3 and 6 keV. The as-deposited films were found to consist mainly of a WSx phase, similar to WS 2 but with a broader range of chemical states. It is shown that ion bombardment of the surface not only removes the outermost <b>oxidized</b> <b>material,</b> but also leads to preferential sputtering of sulfur and the formation of metallic tungsten. The results are of strong interest for the analysis of WS 2 -based materials, as they demonstrate that spectra from sputter-cleaned films include effects of sputter damage, and may not be representative of the original sample...|$|R

Rapid wear of the <b>oxidized</b> <b>material</b> leaves a surface whose properties are the same as non-oxidized material.
