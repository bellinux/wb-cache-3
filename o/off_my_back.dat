All of sudden I'm diagnosed manic-depressive. 'Let's put Axl on medication.' Well, the medication doesn't help me deal with stress.

2500|$|The Nuggets won the Northwest Division {{and placed}} 2nd in the Western Conference, {{finishing}} {{the season with}} a franchise record-tying 54 wins (54–28 overall). Anthony averaged 22.8 ppg and made a career high 37.1% of his shots from three-point range. After losing in 5 straight playoff appearances (2004–2008), on April 29, 2009, Anthony won his first playoff series when the Nuggets beat the New Orleans Hornets at home 107–86 where Anthony finished with a playoff career high 34 points and 4 steals. In a post-game conference Anthony said [...] "Yeah, finally.. Took me 5 years to get that gorilla <b>off</b> <b>my</b> <b>back,</b> it's a great feeling." [...] The Nuggets beat the Hornets in five games {{in the first round of}} the playoffs and proceeded to beat the Dallas Mavericks 4–1 in the conference semifinals with Anthony scoring 30 points in a solid game 5 performance. In the third game of the semifinals, Anthony made a last second three-point shot to give the Nuggets the win after being down by 2 points (103–105). Denver advanced to the conference finals for the first time since 1985 but was eliminated, 4–2, by the eventual NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers on his birthday.|$|E

5000|$|A {{scheduling}} {{conflict between}} {{a tour of}} Australia and a television role with Tom Clancy provoked Liam to leave the group in early 1976. Tom allegedly accepted a television role over the tour of Australia, {{even though he had}} already signed a contract to do the tour. When confronted over the conflict, Liam later recalled Tom telling him, [...] "Get <b>off</b> <b>my</b> fucking <b>back,</b> little brother." [...] Soon afterwards, their sister Cait Clancy O'Connell was killed in a car crash. After the funeral in Ireland, Liam told his brothers {{that they would have to}} find a replacement for him. [...] "I'm not going to work with you anymore—I can't be the 'little brother' anymore," [...] Liam said, according to an interview in The Yellow Bittern. Louis Killen left as well, and Paddy and Tom decided to take a short hiatus from singing.|$|R
6000|$|... "That may be true," [...] replied Lightfoot's friend. [...] "I don't {{doubt it}} is true. But {{you are willing}} to take {{advantage}} of the fact that the dogs of some one else have broken the law. You knew that those dogs had driven that Deer into the Big River and you promptly took advantage of the fact to try to reach that Deer before he could get across. You are not hunting for the pleasure of hunting but just to kill. You don't know the meaning of justice or fairness. Now get <b>off</b> <b>my</b> land. Get <b>back</b> into your boat and <b>off</b> <b>my</b> land as quick as you can. That Deer is not very far from here and so tired that he cannot move. Just as long as he will stay here, he will be safe, and I hope he will stay until this miserable hunting season is ended. Now go." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Ah, that is true, {{but there}} is a vast {{difference}} between laughing and smiling under water. But is it not singular that you should doubt the only incident in the story which I personally verified? I happened to be in lodgings at the seaside while writing that story, and, after penning the passage you refer to, I went down to the shore, pulled <b>off</b> <b>my</b> clothes, dived to the bottom, turned on <b>my</b> <b>back,</b> and, looking up, I smiled and winked." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{turned and}} looked at me. [...] "Ha, old Ten Per Cent!" [...] he called out, struggling. [...] "It's you, then, is it? Never, never to you, sir!" [...] And as he spoke, he somehow flung his arms {{straight}} out behind him, and let the dust-coat slip off, which it easily did, the sleeves being new and smoothly silk-lined. The suddenness of the movement threw me completely <b>off</b> <b>my</b> guard, and <b>off</b> <b>my</b> legs as well. I was clinging to the coat and holding him. As the support gave way I rolled over backward, in the mud of the street, and hurt <b>my</b> <b>back</b> seriously. As for Colonel Clay, with a nervous laugh, he bolted off at full speed in his evening coat, and vanished round a corner.|$|R

6000|$|... "But {{by and by}} the irrepressible alarm {{invented a}} new kink. One winter's night we were flung out of bed by the sudden music of that awful gong, and when we hobbled to the annunciator, turned up the gas, and saw the word 'Nursery' exposed, Mrs. McWilliams fainted dead away, and I came {{precious}} near {{doing the same thing}} myself. I seized my shotgun, and stood timing the coachman whilst that appalling buzzing went on. I knew that his gong had flung him out, too, and that he would be along with his gun as soon as he could jump into his clothes. When I judged that the time was ripe, I crept to the room next the nursery, glanced through the window, and saw the dim outline of the coachman in the yard below, standing at present-arms and waiting for a chance. Then I hopped into the nursery and fired, and in the same instant the coachman fired at the red flash of my gun. Both of us were successful; I crippled a nurse, and he shot <b>off</b> all <b>my</b> <b>back</b> hair. We turned up the gas, and telephoned for a surgeon. There was not a sign of a burglar, and no window had been raised. One glass was absent, but that was where the coachman's charge had come through. Here was a fine mystery--a burglar alarm 'going off' at midnight of its own accord, and not a burglar in the neighborhood! ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But these fellows, now," [...] said Jonathan, with a curious, {{appealing}} manner--"these fellows {{with their}} seventy pounds! Perhaps, Mr. Archer, {{they were no}} true thieves after all, but just {{people who had been}} robbed and tried to get their own again. What was that you said, about all England and the taxes?

6000|$|... 'HOUND! do you mutiny?' screamed he, and, at {{the same}} time, gave me a lash across the face with the cane, which had the {{anticipated}} effect of producing a struggle.

60|$|For {{a moment}} I was too stunned to act.

At last, with my jacket torn nearly <b>off</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> and blood dripping from my wrists, I was hauled backwards in the bight of a rope and cords passed round my ankles and my arms.|$|E

The weir and lock, the last {{remaining}} on the Thames, were removed that year leaving the mooring cuts which are still in use. There was a lock keeper at the weir and a walkway across which is the precedent for the current bridge. The flash lock was notoriously difficult and Thacker quoted Henry Taunt: [...] "I recollect one winter in passing this very weir, when lying on <b>my</b> <b>back</b> in the boat to get through, scraping a fair amount of skin <b>off</b> <b>my</b> nose and face though contact with the bridge whilst going under it." ...|$|R
