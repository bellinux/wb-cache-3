5|$|HMS Defender was a D-class {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. The ship was initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet before she {{was transferred to the}} China Station in early 1935. She was temporarily deployed in the Red Sea during late 1935 during the Abyssinia Crisis, before returning to her assigned station where she remained until mid-1939. Defender was transferred back to the Mediterranean Fleet just before World War II began in September 1939. She briefly was assigned to West Africa for convoy escort duties in 1940 before returning to the Mediterranean. The ship participated in the Battles of Calabria, Cape Spartivento, and Cape Matapan over the next year without damage. Defender assisted in the evacuations from Greece and Crete in April–May 1941, before she began running supply missions to Tobruk, Libya in June. The ship was badly damaged by a German bomber <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> missions and had to be scuttled by her consort on 11 July 1941.|$|E
5|$|The Team of the Year Award {{was first}} {{presented}} in 1960, {{six years after}} the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award was introduced. The first recipient of the award was the Cooper Formula One Racing team. The England national rugby union team and the Ryder Cup team have won the award the most times; both teams have won five times and have shared the award <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> occasions. Liverpool F.C. have won the award three times. The award has been shared on two occasions—by the British women's 4x400m relay team and the British Ryder Cup team in 1969, and by the England national rugby union team and the British men's 4x400m relay team in 1991. Teams have varied greatly in size. The smallest winning team has been two members; the figure skating duo of Torvill and Dean in 1982 and 1983, and the Olympic men's coxless rowing pair of Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent in 1992 and 1996. The largest winning team was in 2012; the British representatives at the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.|$|E

25|$|Britannia {{was built}} in South Carolina (probably Charleston) in 1772. Prior to 1798, Britannia sailed between London and South Carolina, or simply served as a transport. In 1798 she changed {{ownership}} and began a sequence of whaling voyages. Between 1798 and 1807 she {{made a number of}} whaling voyages to the South Seas whale fishery, and the coast of South Africa. <b>On</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> voyages a French privateer captured her, but Britannia was recaptured almost immediately. Between 1808 and 1816, the last year in which she is listed, she returned to operating as a London-based transport.|$|E

25|$|Melody Roulette—A wheel was spun onstage to {{determine}} a cash prize for identifying the tune. Early in both the daytime and syndicated versions the wheel contained categories. Each contestant selected a category before each spin and received $100 if the wheel stopped on their choice. However, the categories were later replaced by money amounts ranging from $20–$1,000 from 1974–76, $50–$1,000 from 1976–77, and $100–$1,000 from 1977–81 on the syndicated series and $50–$500 on the 1977 daytime series. Also, during early playings on the syndicated version, each contestant selected a $200 space on the wheel. If the wheel landed <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> spaces, that contestant won $200 automatically {{prior to the start}} of the tune.|$|E

25|$|Having {{successfully}} completed {{his trip to}} Alaska, Caamaño was sent, after a brief stay in San Blas, across the Pacific Ocean to the Philippines. From 1794 to 1807 he served at various posts between México and Perú, having married <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> trips the Ecuadorian, Francisca de Arteta Santistevan, who gave him eight children. In 1820 he was still living in Guayaquil, the birthplace of his youngest daughter, but nothing is known of the date and place of his death. Some of his descendants, the Caamaño family, have been historically prominent in Ecuador, most notably his grandson, José Plácido Caamaño, who {{became president of the}} Republic. Also noted is his great-grandson, Jacinto Jijón y Caamaño, a noted aristocrat, historian and politician; as well as another great-grandson, the poet Ernesto Noboa y Caamaño, among others.|$|E
25|$|He also {{suffered}} a form slump in Tests, {{but that was}} not quite as brutal, and he was never dropped from the Test team. Despite recording eight single-figure scores between the 1982–83 tour of New Zealand {{and the end of the}} 1983–84, but that period also included three Test fifties. <b>On</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> occasions, at Wellington, he carried his bat through the Sri Lankan innings. And he paid up for his lean streak with his second Test century on the 1984 tour of England. Batting for eleven hours in a match frequently interrupted by rain, he eked out 190, which gave Sri Lanka a 121-run first innings lead. However, that had taken four days to achieve, and Sri Lanka opted to bat out the fifth day for a draw. Wettimuny only made 13 in the second innings, but he had set a new Sri Lankan record highest score, which stood until Brendon Kuruppu passed it with Sri Lanka's first Test double century in a 1986–87 Test against New Zealand. The 190 also made an imprint in the minds of English cricket fans, as he was made Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1985, the first Sri Lankan to be thus honoured, and only the fifth Sri Lankan to date. In fact, he became the first Sri Lankan to score a test century at Lord's Cricket Ground.|$|E

500|$|Bradman's game evolved with experience. He {{temporarily}} adapted {{his technique}} during the Bodyline series, deliberately {{moving around the}} crease {{in an attempt to}} score from the short-pitched deliveries. At his peak, in the mid-1930s, he had the ability to switch between a defensive and attacking approach as the occasion demanded. After the Second World War, he adjusted to bat within the limitations set by his age, becoming a steady [...] "accumulator" [...] of runs. However, Bradman never truly mastered batting on sticky wickets. Wisden commented, [...] "f there really is a blemish on his amazing record it is... the absence of a significant innings <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> 'sticky dogs' of old".|$|E
500|$|Doug Williams {{completed}} only 5 of 19 {{passes for}} 60 yards with four interceptions before being pulled {{in favor of}} Mike Rae. Bears quarterback Mike Phipps completed six passes, all to Dave Williams. The Bears scored <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> receptions, and on a Walter Payton run. The Buccaneers' Williams was nearly ejected from the game after throwing Bears lineman Mike Hartenstine to the ground by his face mask after a Gary Fencik interception. The Bears' five interceptions were their most against the Buccaneers. The Buccaneers' play was later described as [...] "flat" [...] by Bears players. Wally Chambers dismissed talk of the team's inexperience, noting the intensity with which the team had played against the Giants two weeks prior. The last time the Buccaneers had been shut out previous to this game was the last game of their 0–26 losing streak in 1977, also against the Bears.|$|E
500|$|The Beach Boys {{recorded}} {{using what}} was predominantly radio broadcasting equipment, which lacked {{many of the}} technical elements and effects found in an established studio. This led to unconventional ways of achieving particular sounds at the home, such {{as a replacement for}} what would be achieved by an echo chamber. The album's engineer Jim Lockert recalled how [...] "Brian's swimming pool had a leak in it and was empty, so we put a microphone in the bottom of this damn near Olympic-size pool and the guys laid down inside the pool and sang so the sound would go down the wall of the concrete pool into the microphone – and {{that was part of the}} vocals <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> songs." [...] Some recording accidents were used to their advantage, such as in [...] "With Me Tonight", which contains an informal link between the verse and chorus by way of a voice saying [...] "good", as in [...] "good take", spoken by the band's road manager Arnie Geller from the control room. Lockert has spoken about other peculiarities of the sessions, including vocals being tracked in the shower. Due to this eclectic mix of recording paraphernalia and idiosyncratic methods of tracking the sounds, Smiley Smile possesses an unusual sound.|$|E
