25|$|The {{difficulty}} of procuring disks of glass (especially of flint glass) of suitable purity and homogeneity limited the diameter and light gathering {{power of the}} lenses found in the achromatic telescope. It was in vain that the French Academy of Sciences offered prizes for large perfect disks of <b>optical</b> <b>flint</b> glass.|$|E
5000|$|After {{successfully}} {{defending a}} legal {{challenge to the}} patent he held for the achromatic lens the business prospered and he successfully sued his rivals for patent infringement. [...] Dollond's reputation, especially with his father being a Fellow of the Royal Society {{as a result of}} his development and patenting of the achromat, provided the company with the de facto right of refusal on the best <b>optical</b> <b>flint</b> glass. [...] This privilege permitted Dollond to maintain an edge in quality over competitor's telescopes and optical instruments for many years.|$|E
5000|$|On 18 January 2003, {{the devastating}} Canberra {{firestorm}} hit Mount Stromlo (which {{was surrounded by}} a plantation pine forest), destroying five telescopes, workshops, seven homes, and the heritage-listed administration building. [...] The only telescope to escape the fires was the 1886 15-centimetre Farnham telescope. Relics from the fire are preserved {{in the collection of the}} National Museum of Australia. They include a melted telescope mirror and a piece of melted <b>optical</b> glass (<b>flint).</b> The latter has pieces of charcoal and wire fused into it from the fierce heat of the fire.|$|R
40|$|Particle {{tracks were}} {{investigated}} {{in the glass}} plate of a neutral density (clear <b>flint)</b> <b>optical</b> filter housed in the Surveyor 3 TV camera but exposed directly to space. The track density vs depth curve was determined and descends sharply from approximately 2. 6 million tracks/sq cm {{at a depth of}} 3. 6 mg/sq cm to about 35 /sq cm at 700 mg/sq cm. Several tracks were of V-shapes characteristic of high energy induced fission. The erosion rate on the moon due to solar wind ions was determined from the energy spectrum, and was found to be low (0 to 2 x 10 to the minus 8 th power cm/yr) ...|$|R
