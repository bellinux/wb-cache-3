5|$|The show's title {{character}} is {{portrayed in the}} two pilots by Pal, the MGM film Lassie. Thereafter, five of his male descendants played the role. His son Lassie Junior performed through the Jeff years and first two Timmy years before retiring in 1959 to battle cancer. Though he recovered, Lassie Junior never worked the show again. His son Spook was rushed into the series while his brother Baby was in training for the role. Spook was inadequately prepared and never became comfortable on the set after an <b>overhead</b> <b>light</b> crashed to the floor on his first day. Weatherwax, however, coaxed a natural and seemingly confident performance from the frightened dog, and some regard Spook's portrayal as Weatherwax's finest work. Spook played the role {{in the spring and}} fall of 1960. Baby, son of Lassie Junior and brother to Spook, worked the show for six years. He appeared in the last Timmy years, and two of the Forest Service seasons. Baby died at eight years of age, the only Lassie not to live at least seventeen years. He was followed in the role by Mire who played Lassie for five years. He portrayed the fictional collie in the syndicated seasons.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{shadowing}} effect produced by surrounding buildings onto the premises of civil buildings that have natural <b>overhead</b> <b>lighting</b> systems is under consideration. The authors demonstrate {{the need to take}} account of this effect in the course of illumination design according to the construction legislation. The authors also project the efficiency improvement of new designs of advanced <b>overhead</b> <b>lighting</b> elements. The authors have also compiled an overview of the present-day status quo in the design of natural lighting systems that incorporate <b>overhead</b> <b>lighting</b> elements, including roof monitors and skylights used in modern urban design. Due to the need for maximal fl oor space, public buildings (supermarkets, restaurants, entertainment centres, etc.), being restricted in height by specific urban conditions, have to go underground - either entirely, or with only a few stories above the ground level. This trend drives attention to <b>overhead</b> <b>lighting</b> systems as the only source of natural lighting of the interior premises. Hence, the authors insist on the relevant need to elaborate a new approach to the calculation of the daylight factor values in the premises that have <b>overhead</b> <b>lighting</b> systems with account for shading and reflecting effects of surrounding buildings...|$|R

25|$|Beirut National Museum is the {{principal}} museum of archaeology in Lebanon. The collection was begun after World War I, and the museum was officially opened in 1942. The museum has collections totaling about 100,000 objects, {{most of which are}} antiquities and medieval finds from excavations undertaken by the Directorate General of Antiquities. About 1300 artifacts are exhibited, ranging in date from prehistoric times to the medieval Mamluk period. The museum was designed in a French-inspired Egyptian Revival architecture and built with Lebanese Ochre limestone. It comprises a basement, a ground floor, a mezzanine floor and a terrace; the central block is covered by a glass roof, above the mezzanine, giving natural <b>overhead</b> <b>light.</b> The whole site is approximately 5,500 square meters (59,000 sq ft), and the exhibition floor space totals 6,000 square meters (65,000 sq ft). The immediately adjoining museum annexes and administrative offices occupy about 1,000 square meters (11,000 sq ft). The museum displays follow a chronological circuit beginning in Prehistory and ending in the Ottoman era. The circuit begins on the ground floor where 83 large objects are displayed, these include sarcophagi, mosaics statues and reliefs. The upper floor displays 1243 small and medium-sized artifacts arranged by chronological order and by theme in modern showcases with soft lighting and magnifying glasses that emphasize the aesthetic aspect of the artifacts.|$|E

2500|$|A star {{sapphire}} {{is a type}} of sapphire that {{exhibits a}} star-like phenomenon known as asterism; red stones are known as [...] "star rubies". Star sapphires contain intersecting needle-like inclusions following the underlying crystal structure that causes the appearance of a six-rayed [...] "star"-shaped pattern when viewed with a single <b>overhead</b> <b>light</b> source. The inclusion is often the mineral rutile, a mineral composed primarily of titanium dioxide. The stones are cut en cabochon, typically with the center of the star {{near the top of the}} dome. Occasionally, twelve-rayed stars are found, typically because two different sets of inclusions are found within the same stone, such as a combination of fine needles of rutile with small platelets of hematite; the first results in a whitish star and the second results in a golden-colored star. During crystallisation, the two types of inclusions become preferentially oriented in different directions within the crystal, thereby forming two six-rayed stars that are superimposed upon each other to form a twelve-rayed star. Misshapen stars or 12-rayed stars may also form as a result of twinning.|$|E
2500|$|Candlestick Park was {{frequently}} beshrouded in fog, {{both inside and}} out, {{coming in from the}} Pacific Ocean seven miles to the west (through {{what is known as the}} [...] "Alemany Gap", a wide gorge ocean winds come through in lieu of major topographical obstacles). A foghorn was eventually situated and sounded inside the stadium between innings, adding to Candlestick's already notorious meteorological reputation. Winds would whirl around in the parking lot at other times while it would be calm inside the stadium. Even with its cold, windy and foggy reputation, it stood its ground when the ground below it shook violently just before the scheduled start of [...] Game 3 of the 1989 World Series. At 5:04pm, the Loma Prieta earthquake shook the San Francisco Bay Area during the pregame ceremonies. For 15 seconds the stadium rocked, and it was feared that one or more of the huge <b>overhead</b> <b>light</b> towers might fall on spectators in the stands; but only minor injuries were reported and the stadium's structure was deemed safe ten days later.|$|E
2500|$|The Crossrail route {{planned to}} open in 2018 will form a new east-west cross-London route which will join onto the Great Western Main Line and cross the West London Line [...] south of Willesden Junction at Old Oak Common. A new station, Old Oak Common railway station, is planned at this site to provide an {{interchange}} between Crossrail, the GWML and High Speed 2. Due to the proximity of Willesden Junction, {{it has been suggested}} that an interchange could be added with the North London, Bakerloo, Watford DC and West London Lines. A 2010 Department for Transport command paper highlights opportunities for interchanges at Old Oak Common with London Underground, London Overground and Southern's cross-London services, while a report prepared by Terry Farrell and Partners for the Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham proposes the construction of an <b>overhead</b> <b>light</b> rail, automated people mover or personal rapid transit system linking [...] "Old Oak Central" [...] with Willesden Junction.

2500|$|A 1976 AMC Pacer Hatchback {{was used}} in the 1992 movie Wayne's World, and again in the 1993 movie Wayne's World 2. The Pacer used in both movies was painted bright blue with flame decals, with stock steel wheels and wheel covers in the front, and {{aftermarket}} chrome-plated steel wheels in the rear. It featured a two-tone light blue-and-beige vinyl interior, as well as a licorice dispenser mounted in place of the <b>overhead</b> <b>light</b> in the headliner. The car is used throughout both movies, however, the car is seen the most in the first Wayne's World movie in the introductory scene, where Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers) inserts a cassette tape into the stereo of the Pacer, and Wayne, Garth Algar (Dana Carvey), and his friends rock out and head bang to [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] by Queen. Modifications to the movie car included interior camera mounts, tow hooks welded to the front subframe, and the removal of the HVAC system. The rear wheel wells were modified to accommodate aftermarket speaker boxes, the aforementioned licorice dispenser was added, and an additional cup holder was added to the Pacer's dashboard. The car used an AMC 258 c.i. six-cylinder engine and an automatic transmission.|$|E
60|$|Tedham {{was sitting}} in the chair I had shown him when I brought him in, and in the half-light of one gas-burner in the {{chandelier}} he looked, with his rough, clean clothes, and his slouch hat lying in his lap, like some sort of decent workingman; his features, refined by the mental suffering he had undergone, and the pallor of a complexion so seldom exposed to the open air, gave him the effect of a workingman just out of the hospital. His eyes were deep in their sockets, and showed fine shadows in the <b>overhead</b> <b>light,</b> and I must say he looked very interesting.|$|E

The place was enormous--larger than any building you have ever seen--and in one place there was the old gate of Capri, caught into the wall of a gallery high <b>overhead.</b> <b>Light</b> girders, stems and threads of gold, burst from the pillars like fountains, streamed like an Aurora across the roof and interlaced, like--like conjuring tricks. All about the great circle for the dancers there were beautiful figures, strange dragons, and intricate and wonderful grotesques bearing lights. The place was inundated with artificial light that shamed the newborn day. And as we went through the throng the people turned about and looked at us, for all through the world my name and face were known, and how I had suddenly thrown up pride and struggle to come to this place. And they looked also at the lady beside me, though half the story of how at last she had come to me was unknown or mistold. And few of the men who were there, I know, but judged me a happy man, {{in spite of all the}} shame and dishonour that had come upon my name.|$|E
