5|$|Protactinium {{exhibits}} two valence states; the +5 is stable, and the +4 state easily oxidizes to protactinium(V). Thus tetravalent protactinium in solutions {{is obtained}} {{by the action of}} strong reducing agents in a hydrogen atmosphere. Tetravalent protactinium is chemically similar to uranium(IV) and thorium(IV). Fluorides, phosphates, hypophosphate, iodate and phenylarsonates of protactinium(IV) are insoluble in water and dilute acids. Protactinium forms soluble carbonates. The hydrolytic properties of pentavalent protactinium are close to those of tantalum(V) and niobium(V). The complex chemical behavior of protactinium is a consequence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> of the filling of the 5f shell in this element.|$|E

5|$|The Muisca {{period is}} {{commonly}} set commencing from 800 AD and lasting until the Spanish {{conquest of the}} Muisca in 1537, although regional variations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> dates are noted. The Early Muisca Period, roughly defined from 800 to 1000 AD, showed an increase in long-distance trade with the Caribbean coastal indigenous populations, mummification {{and the introduction of}} goldworking. The transition between Early Muisca and Late Muisca is defined by a more complex society, interregional trade of pottery, population growth and settlements of larger sizes closer to the agricultural lands. When the Spanish conquistadors arrived on the Altiplano, they described a concentration of settlements on the flatlands of the Bogotá savanna.|$|E

40|$|We give an {{intuitive}} though general explanation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finite-size effect in scale-free networks in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> degree distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> network.

We use two different approaches: the deterministic mean-field approximation used by Barabási and Albert (but {{taking into account}} <b>the</b> nodes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> network), and <b>the</b> probability distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> each node, which considers the stochastic process. Numerical simulations show that <b>the</b> accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> predictions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mean-field approximation depend on <b>the</b> contribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dispersion in the final distribution.
