Making matters worse, the local mining companies had again reduced wages, and railroad and industry owners imposed similar cuts for rail and manufacturing workers.

This prompted Canada's Immigration Minister, Jason Kenney, to denounce Suzuki as [...] "xenophobic", labelling his comments as [...] "toxic".|$|E
40|$|The {{concepts}} of demography {{provide a means}} of combining the ecological approach to population growth with the genetical approach to natural selection. We have utilized the demographic theory of natural selection developed by Norton and Charlesworth to analyze life history schedules of births and deaths for populations of genotypes in Drosophila pseudoobscura. <b>Our</b> <b>populations</b> illustrate a stable genetic equilibrium, an unstable genetic equilibrium, and a case of no equilibrium. We have estimated population growth rates and Darwinian fitnesses of the genotypes and have explored the role of population growth in determining natural selection. The age-specific rates of births and deaths provide insights into components of selection. Both viability and fertility are important components in <b>our</b> <b>populations...</b>|$|R

However, {{it is important that}} there are many who believe in them {{and will continue to do}} so in spite of any official pronouncement which may be made. This whole affair has demonstrated that there is a fair proportion of <b>our</b> <b>population</b> which is mentally conditioned to acceptance of the incredible. Thus we arrive at two danger points which, in a situation of international tension, seem to have National Security implications.” ...|$|E
2500|$|There is {{debate over}} whether {{immigration}} can slow the ageing of Australia's population. In a research paper entitled Population Futures for Australia: the Policy Alternatives, Peter McDonald claims that [...] "it is demographic nonsense to believe that immigration can help to keep <b>our</b> <b>population</b> young." [...] However, according to Creedy and Alvarado (p. 99), by 2031 {{there will be a}} 1.1 per cent fall in the proportion of the population aged over 65 if net migration rate is 80,000 per year. If net migration rate is 170,000 per year, the proportion of the population aged over 65 would reduce by 3.1 per cent. As of 2007 during the leadership of John Howard, the net migration rate was 160,000 per year.|$|E

2500|$|To {{the extent}} that lawyer {{advertising}} might be said to encourage frivolous lawsuits, the Court countered that the American Bar Association had observed that the [...] "middle 70% of <b>our</b> <b>population</b> is not being reached or served adequately by the legal profession," [...] suggesting that {{a vast number of}} meritorious cases are being stifled for want of a lawyer willing and able to assist the client in bringing suit. [...] Bans on advertising, moreover, are ineffective means of reducing lawyer overhead and of maintaining the quality of legal services provided. [...] Finally, {{there was no reason to}} believe that allowing lawyers to advertise would result in a tidal wave of disingenuous claims for the state bar to investigate and prosecute, as Justice Powell feared would happen. [...] "For every attorney who overreaches through advertising, there will be thousands of others who will be candid and honest and straightforward." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the Commonwealth Treasury, {{immigration}} {{can reduce}} {{the average age of}} the Australian population: [...] "The level of net overseas migration is important: net inflows of migrants to Australia reduce the rate of population ageing because migrants are younger on average than the resident population. Currently, around 85 per cent of migrants are aged under 40 when they migrate to Australia, compared to around 55 per cent for the resident population." [...] Ross Gittins, an economics columnist at Fairfax Media, has said that the Government's focus on skilled migration has in fact reduced the average age of migrants. [...] "More than half are aged 15 to 34, compared with 28 per cent of <b>our</b> <b>population.</b> Only 2 per cent of permanent immigrants are 65 or older, compared with 13 per cent of our population." [...] Because of these statistics, Gittens claims that immigration is slowing the ageing of the Australian population and that the [...] "net benefit to the economy is a lot more clear-cut." ...|$|E
2500|$|The largest {{hindrance}} {{to effectively}} organizing the militia was the scattered population of only 14,273; and of this number, {{the majority were}} scattered around the state on isolated farms. The only real town in Arkansas in 1820 was Arkansas Post, a tiny village {{of no more than}} forty houses. To make matters worse, there were few roads in Territorial Arkansas, thereby making communication with the militiamen very difficult. Adjutant General A. P. Spencer noted that some militia units were unable to drill since [...] "the extent of Territory they cover is [...] great to muster them at one point..." [...] As late as 1827, Governor George Izard was complaining of the difficulty of organizing the rural Arkansans into a cohesive militia force: [...] "The scattered state of <b>our</b> <b>Population</b> here and the constant changes of Residence among the Inhabitants make it impractical to organize the Militia in such a manner as may render their Service prompt and efficient".|$|E

2500|$|No {{meeting of}} the {{territorial}} legislature occurred during McCord's time in office. He did however submit an annual report on September 30, 1897. The report highlighted the Arizona's need for irrigation and listed several potential dam sites. McCord also suggested the Federal government should assist in effort to build the needed infrastructure. [...] The economic section of report listed all the territory's mines and gave information on agricultural and cattle ranching industries. In addition to the sugar beets being grown near Yuma, McCord suggested tobacco and peanuts as potential new crops. In reference to Arizona's statehood effort, McCord wrote [...] "While <b>our</b> <b>population</b> is not so numerous as some might {{think it should be}} to entitle us to be intrusted with self-government, yet we claim and insist that what we make up in quality what we lack in quantity". McCord also used the report to recommend construction of a permanent territorial capital building to provide a safe location for governmental record storage.|$|E
