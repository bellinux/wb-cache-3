40|$|IntroductionAlcohol {{consumption}} {{has been}} identified as a risk factor for many cancers but less {{attention has been paid to}} the fraction <b>of</b> those <b>cancers</b> that are attributable to alcohol consumption. In this study, we evaluated the incidence and population attributable fraction (PAF) <b>of</b> <b>cancers</b> associated with alcohol consumption in Nigeria. MethodsWe obtained data on incidence <b>of</b> <b>cancers</b> from two population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) in Nigeria and identified cancer sites for which there is strong evidence of an association with alcohol consumption based on the International Agency for Research on Cancer Monograph 100 E. We computed the PAF for each cancer site by age and sex, using prevalence and relative risk estimates from previous studies. ResultsBetween 2012 and 2014 study period, the PBCRs reported 4, 336 <b>cancer</b> cases <b>of</b> which 1, 627 occurred in males, and 2, 709 occurred in females. Of these, a total <b>of</b> 1, 808 <b>cancer</b> cases, 339 in males and 1, 469 in females, were associated with alcohol intake. The age standardized incidence rate (ASR) <b>of</b> alcohol associated <b>cancers</b> was 77. 3 per 100, 000. Only 4. 3 % (186 / 4, 336) <b>of</b> all <b>cancer</b> cases or 10. 3 % (186 / 1, 808) <b>of</b> alcohol associated <b>cancers</b> were attributable to alcohol consumption. Some 42. 5 % (79 / 186) <b>of</b> these <b>cancers</b> occurred in males while 57. 5 % (107 / 186) occurred in females. The ASR <b>of</b> <b>cancers</b> attributable to alcohol in this population was 7. 2 per 100, 000. The commonest cancers attributable to alcohol consumption were <b>cancers</b> <b>of</b> the oral cavity and pharynx in men and <b>cancer</b> <b>of</b> the breast in women. ConclusionOur study shows that 4. 3 % <b>of</b> incident <b>cancers</b> in Nigeria can be prevented by avoiding alcohol consumption. While the incidence <b>of</b> <b>cancers</b> associated with alcohol intake is high, the proportion attributable to alcohol consumption is much lower suggesting that the number <b>of</b> <b>cancers</b> that may be prevented by eliminating alcohol intake in this population is relatively low...|$|R
