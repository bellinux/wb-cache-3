50|$|The bridge {{underwent}} a major rehabilitation in 2016. This work raised concerns among bridge preservationists, as it included alterations that {{put at risk}} the bridge's distinctive <b>overhead</b> <b>bracing,</b> which is not found on other bridges in the state. Alterations also include rebuilding the road deck to increase the weight limit to seven tons (from the previous five).|$|E
50|$|The Allan truss, {{designed}} by Percy Allan, is partly {{based on the}} Howe truss. The first Allan truss wascompleted on 13 August 1894 over Glennies Creek at Camberwell, New South Wales and the last Allan truss bridge was built over Mill Creek near Wisemans Ferry in 1929. Completed in March 1895, the Tharwa Bridge located at Tharwa, Australian Capital Territory, was the second Allan truss bridge to be built, the oldest surviving bridge in the Australian Capital Territory and the oldest, longest continuously used Allan truss bridge. Completed in November 1895, the Hampden Bridge in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, Australia, {{the first of the}} Allan truss bridges with <b>overhead</b> <b>bracing,</b> was originally designed as a steel bridge but was constructed with timber to reduce cost. In his design, Allan used Australian ironbark for its strength. A similar bridge also {{designed by}} Percy Allen is the Victoria Bridge on Prince Street, Picton, New South Wales. Also constructed of ironbark, the bridge is still in use today for pedestrian and light traffic.|$|E
40|$|Lateral {{torsional}} buckling {{is a key}} factor in the design of steel girders. Stability can be enhanced by cross‐bracing, reducing the effective length and thus increasing the ultimate capacity. U‐frames are an option often used to brace the girders, when designing through type of bridges and where <b>overhead</b> <b>bracing</b> is not practical. This paper investigates the effect of the U‐frame spacing on the stability of the parallel girders. Eigenvalue buckling analysis was undertaken with four different spacings of the U‐frames. Results were extracted from finite element analysis, interpreted and conclusions drawn...|$|E
50|$|Each truss is 103.7 metres long, 12.6 metres {{high in the}} middle, 8.2 metres wide, {{and weighs}} {{approximately}} 606 tonnes. Their design employs a double-intersection web system of diagonal members, based on the Linville system developed in the United States in the 1860s. They are strengthened by horizontal wind bracing at roadway level, and by elaborate <b>overhead</b> cross <b>bracing.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge is}} the second one to span the river at Goondiwindi. It was erected in 1914-1915 and {{replaced}} a timber structure which served the border river crossing from 1878. The bridge was built {{at the expense of}} both colonies, at a cost of £12,325/5/-, but on the responsibility of Queensland. It consists of two 120ft. spans of hogbacked steel-lattice girders, <b>braced</b> <b>overhead</b> with steel lattice bracing. The roadway has a width of 20ft. in the clear, and is carried above the highest known flood level.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} is {{an arrangement of}} pens. On the lower level, {{the north end of}} the barn has the main entrance. To the east is a permanent stairway to the upper level. Symmetrically from this northern bay are eight equally spaced stalls, each with a gate at the barn's center and containing a door and window on the outer wall. At each of the points of intersection of the inner stall walls are large posts that extend to an <b>overhead</b> beam, which <b>braces</b> the floor joists of the upper level. The center of the barn is left open for movement of animals.|$|R
50|$|The Dodd Ford Bridge {{is one of}} {{only two}} {{surviving}} bridges known to have been built by Johnson while he operated as a contractor under his own name. In its design and engineering it is a conventional, pin-connected, nine-panel, 148.5 ft, steel truss of the overhead Pratt variety. During {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth centuries, this general type of truss was commonly used throughout the United States for highway crossings of approximately 90 to 150 feet in length. Reflecting the prevailing bridge-engineering practices of its time, this bridge has relatively light construction by later automobile-inspired standards. The bridge employs laced channel sections for vertical compression members, paired eyebars for horizontal tension members and lower chord members, angle sections for <b>overhead</b> sway <b>bracing</b> and portal bracing, and crossed eyebars for top-lateral and bottom-lateral bracing. The bridge further evokes its period by virtue of its narrow 15 ft roadway with a plank deck supported on wood stringers. Such design was later prohibited by the Minnesota Highway Commission (established in 1905). The Commission advocated a 16-foot minimum roadway, steel stringers, and preferred a reinforced-concrete deck.|$|R
