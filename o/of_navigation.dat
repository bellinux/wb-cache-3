5|$|Among the anecdotes <b>of</b> <b>navigation</b> by bioluminescence, the Apollo 13 {{astronaut}} Jim Lovell recounted how as a navy pilot he {{had found}} {{his way back to}} his aircraft carrier USS Shangri-La when his navigation systems failed.

30|$|The {{channel is}} an {{important}} part of the water transport system, whose navigation environment has a significant impact on the safe <b>navigation</b> <b>of</b> the ship. Frequent accidents <b>of</b> channel <b>navigation</b> have not only caused great losses to the country, but also hindered the sustainable development of channels. How to protect the safety <b>of</b> shipping <b>navigation</b> environment {{is an important}} research work on safety management of shipping channel. There are many factors affecting the safety <b>of</b> the channel <b>navigation</b> environment. In order to ensure the safety <b>of</b> channel <b>navigation,</b> these influencing factors should be analyzed and studied to provide a scientific and reasonable judging basis for the safety evaluation <b>of</b> the channel <b>navigation</b> environment.|$|R
5|$|As {{the project}} name suggests, the mobile robot is a cobot – a {{collaborative}} robot. During phases <b>of</b> <b>navigation</b> and inspection, a human operator accompanies the robot; {{he can take}} control if necessary, add inspection tasks, note a defect {{that is not in}} the list of robot checks, or validate the results. In the case of pre-flight inspections, the diagnosis of the walk-around is sent to the pilot who decides whether or not to take off.|$|E
5|$|At the {{opposite}} end, at Ysgwrfa, the final five locks before Glynneath have been severed by a realignment {{of the road}} and the construction of a culvert, but the road has carried a lot less traffic since the A465 bypass was opened, and could possibly be rerouted along its original course, where the bridge over the canal still exists. The Neath Canal Act has not been repealed, and so there is still a right <b>of</b> <b>navigation</b> along this section, which should ease the process of reinstating it. The terminus would then be near the Lamb and Flag public house, south of the final two locks, which are unlikely to be restored.|$|E
5|$|Blackburn {{was also}} a zealous {{advocate}} for improved river navigation. He persuaded the legislature to apply a $100,000 allocation from the U.S. Congress to the improvement <b>of</b> <b>navigation</b> along the Kentucky River and gave concurrent jurisdiction over the Big Sandy and Licking Rivers {{to the federal government}} so they could be improved as well. Legislators also approved construction of a canal around the Cumberland Falls and improvements along the Tradewater River.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, the Highfield {{location}} of the College meant it was directly in the war zone itself.

The School <b>of</b> <b>Navigation</b> at the College was relocated to the communal rooms of South Stoneham House {{for the duration of}} the war, and afterwards was moved to Warsash; in 1970 the school became independent of the University (instead it is affiliated to Southampton Solent University) and is known as the Warsash Maritime Academy.|$|E
5|$|During this time, St. Anthony, on {{the east}} side, was {{separate}} from Minneapolis, on the west side. As a result of inferior management of the water power, St. Anthony found its manufacturing district declining. Some people and organizations started to talk about merging the two cities. A citizens' committee recommended merging the two cities in 1866, but a vote on this issue was rejected in 1867. Minneapolis incorporated as a city in 1867. The two cities found themselves competing with St. Paul, which had a larger population, the head <b>of</b> <b>navigation</b> of the Mississippi River, and more access to railroads.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Base {{theoretical}} concepts <b>of</b> interpreting <b>navigation</b> are given. Algorithms <b>of</b> interpreting <b>navigation</b> are offered. These algorithms permit: 1. To set a way {{of mobile}} robot’s movement in mode of a sequence of commands <b>of</b> interpreting <b>navigation</b> (not in coordinate mode). 2. To make absolute interpretation of visible vertixes during movement without notation of a way (if there is certain restrictions on type of terrain and parameters of movement of the robot). 	Special points and the special situations on terrain for problems <b>of</b> interpreting <b>navigation</b> for 2 D statment are considered and their classification is given.

40|$|The T-Ten European program aims at {{optimizing}} {{the transport}} logistics in Europe by promoting alternative transport modes. Navigation transport offers a competitive and environmentally friendly alternative. Hence, it is foresaw an increase <b>of</b> the <b>navigation</b> transport demand {{that it will}} be necessary to accommodate. This will be very challenging particularly in a global change context where less available water resource is expected. A constraint satisfaction problem based on flow graph is proposed in this paper to study the resilience <b>of</b> inland <b>navigation</b> networks against increase <b>of</b> the <b>navigation</b> demand and extreme events. Drought and flood scenarios are simulated considering an network composed <b>of</b> five interconnected <b>navigation</b> reaches.

5|$|The Bristol and Exeter Railway {{opened in}} late 1853, {{and the effects}} on the Parrett Navigation were immediate. Despite {{petitions}} from users of the Westport Canal to keep their section open for navigation, the Commissioners opted to abandon the entire navigation; however, the Westport Canal was maintained for drain purposes only. Some boats continued to use the river to reach Langport and beyond until {{the early years of}} the 20th century. There is still a public right <b>of</b> <b>navigation</b> as far as Oath Lock, but very few private boats use the river, largely due to the fierce tides in the estuary and a lack of moorings along its route.|$|E
5|$|The Environment Agency is the {{navigation}} {{authority for the}} river, which is navigable as far upstream as Crowland, and with very shallow draught to West Deeping Bridge, where further progress is hindered by the derelict lock around the weir. The traditional head <b>of</b> <b>navigation</b> was Wharf Road in Stamford. The management of the lower river has been intimately tied up with the drainage of Deeping Fen, and the river remains important to the Welland and Deepings Internal Drainage Board, for whom it provides the final conduit to the sea for pumped water.|$|E

Raynolds sited and oversaw the installation of dozens of lighthouses in the Great Lakes area, where he served as the superintending engineer from 1864 to 1870. Raynolds was promoted to permanent rank of lieutenant colonel in the Corps of Engineers on March 7, 1867.
