5|$|With {{his film}} career behind him, Whale found himself at a loose end. He {{was offered the}} {{occasional}} job, including the opportunity to direct Since You Went Away for David O. Selznick, but turned them down. Lewis, meanwhile, was busier than ever with his production duties and often worked late hours, leaving Whale lonely and bored. Lewis bought him a supply <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> <b>and</b> canvasses and Whale re-discovered his love of painting. Eventually he built a large studio for himself.|$|E
5|$|The cousins {{went back}} to the {{farmhouse}} to search for the source of the red paint on the silencer. In the kitchen they found marks in the red paint {{on the underside of the}} mantelpiece above the Aga cooker. DI Cook, a scenes-of-crime officer, took a paint sample from the mantelpiece on 14 August. This was found to contain the same 15 layers <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> <b>and</b> varnish that were in the paint flake found on the silencer. Casts were taken of the marks on the mantel, and the marks were deemed consistent with the silencer having come into contact several times with the mantelpiece. The implication was that the silencer had scratched the mantelpiece during a fight for the gun.|$|E
5|$|Reborning {{involves}} numerous {{time consuming}} steps. The most basic {{form of the}} process involves taking a vinyl doll, adding multiple hand painted layers <b>of</b> <b>paint,</b> <b>and</b> adding other physical features to the doll. Artists can pick different brands to best suit the doll they wish to create. Reborn artists can also buy reborn doll kits that are sculpted by reborn sculpt artists. A kit includes the vinyl doll parts. Customers can then purchase a reborn doll by choosing a kit (name) by sculptor (name) and have it reborned by a reborn artist (name) e.g. Adam by Mary reborned by Ann. Consumers can purchase {{a wide range of}} supplies for creating their own reborn. Making a doll from a kit allows artists to omit some steps in the fabrication process and begin with a blank canvas. Many supplies are needed for both external and internal modifications of reborns to make the doll seem more realistic.|$|E

5|$|The battle finally ceased when a shell from Virginia {{struck the}} pilot house of Monitor and exploded, driving {{fragments}} <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> <b>and</b> iron through the viewing slits into Worden's eyes and temporarily blinding him. As {{no one else}} could see to command the ship, Monitor was forced to draw off. The executive officer, Lieutenant Samuel Dana Greene, took over, and Monitor returned to the fight. In the period of command confusion, however, the crew of Virginia believed that their opponent had withdrawn. Although Minnesota was still aground, the falling tide meant that she was out of reach. Furthermore, Virginia had suffered enough damage to require extensive repair. Convinced that his ship had won the day, Jones ordered her back to Norfolk. At about this time, Monitor returned, only to discover her opponent apparently giving up the fight. Convinced that Virginia was quitting, with orders only to protect Minnesota and not to risk his ship unnecessarily, Greene did not pursue. Thus, each side misinterpreted the moves of the other, and as a result each claimed victory.|$|E

25|$|In 1930, {{following}} {{his older brother}} Charles Pollock, he moved to New York City where they both studied under Thomas Hart Benton at the Art Students League. Benton's rural American subject matter had little influence on Pollock's work, but his rhythmic use <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> <b>and</b> his fierce independence were more lasting. In the early 1930s, Pollock spent a summer touring the Western United States together with Glen Rounds, a fellow art student, and Benton, their teacher.|$|E
25|$|John C. Demps {{was named}} {{principal}} in 1976. Drainage renovations were completed in 1980, improving swampy conditions on campus {{which had been}} prone to flooding. In 1986, BCHS received a $24,500 federal grant and implemented a campaign to restore the school's image and spirit. The buildings received a fresh coat <b>of</b> <b>paint,</b> <b>and</b> parents, students and staff re-discovered the words to the fight song thanks to Mary Ann Frey, a teacher who was a 1968 graduate. In January 1987, Barbara Paonessa {{became the first woman}} (and longest-serving) principal until May 2003. An Army Junior ROTC program was established in 1988.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, the Calvi family {{commissioned}} the New York-based investigation company Kroll Associates {{to investigate the}} circumstances of Calvi's death. The case was assigned to Jeff Katz, who was then a senior case manager for the company in London. As part of his two-year investigation, Katz instructed former Home Office forensic scientists, including Angela Gallop, to undertake forensic tests. As a result, {{it was found that}} Calvi could not have hanged himself from the scaffolding because the lack <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> <b>and</b> rust on his shoes proved that he had not walked on the scaffolding. In October 1992, the forensic report was submitted to the Home Secretary and the City of London Police, who dismissed it at the time.|$|E

25|$|Ryder {{used his}} {{materials}} liberally and without care. His paintings, which he often worked on {{for ten years}} or more, were built up of layers <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> <b>and</b> varnish applied {{on top of each}} other. He would often paint into wet varnish, or apply a layer of fast-drying paint over a layer of slow-drying paint. The result is that paintings by Ryder remain unstable and become much darker over time; they crack readily, do not fully dry even after decades, and sometimes completely disintegrate. Because of this, and because some Ryder paintings were completed or reworked by others after his death, many Ryder paintings appear very different today than they did when first created. Many of his paintings suffered damage even during Ryder's lifetime, and he tried to restore them in his later years.|$|E
25|$|The {{roots of}} {{traditional}} Qajar painting {{can be found}} in the style of painting that arose during the preceding Safavid empire. During this time, there was a great deal of European influence on Persian culture, especially in the arts of the royalty and noble classes. European art was undergoing a period of realism and this can be seen in the depiction of objects especially by Qajar artists. The European influence is very well evidenced in the preëminent position and prestige of oil painting. While oil paintings had been par for the course during previous periods of Persian art, it was the influence of the European masters, like Rubens and Rembrandt, the true masters of oil portraiture, that raised it to the highest level. Heavy application <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> <b>and</b> dark, rich, saturated colors are elements of Qajar painting that owe their influences directly to the European style.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{producing}} his first Brushstroke work, Lichtenstein spun his upcoming {{work as a}} satire of Abstract Expressionism.

[...] Years after the series was completed, Lichtenstein claimed the source for the series was Renaissance artist Frans Hals, a painterly artist whose brushstrokes descended from hallowed examples of European art as an inspiration to abstract expressionism.|$|E
