Secondary minerals include hematite, phyllosilicates (clay minerals), goethite, jarosite, iron sulfate minerals, <b>opaline</b> silica, and gypsum.

50|$|Only {{about a dozen}} {{reports of}} <b>opalines</b> in fishes have been published, and even fewer on <b>opalines</b> from reptile or {{salamander}} hosts. Their scarcity outside of anuran hosts had led many to speculate that the others are just incidental infestations—maybe the infested snake had just eaten an infested frog, for example. However, <b>opalines</b> {{have been found in}} saltwater fish which have no access to anurans. Also, the populations of <b>opalines</b> in fish hosts are often very high, suggesting that they are probably reproducing in the fish host.|$|R
5000|$|Lacking a mouth, <b>opalines</b> feed {{by taking}} in {{nutrients}} from their surroundings by pinocytosis. While the <b>opalines</b> are {{often referred to}} as [...] "parasites", two lines of evidence suggest that they are actually commensals which do no harm to their anuran hosts.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>opalines</b> are a {{small group}} of {{peculiar}} heterokonts, currently assigned to the family Opalinidae, in the order Slopalinida. Their name is derived from the opalescent appearance of these microscopic organisms when illuminated with full sunlight (p. 247). [...] Most <b>opalines</b> live as endocommensals in the large intestine and cloaca of anurans (frogs and toads), though they are sometimes found in fish, reptiles, molluscs and insects. The unusual features of the <b>opalines,</b> first observed by Antoine van Leeuwenhoek in 1683, has led to much debate regarding their phylogenetic position among the protists.|$|R
25|$|Some of {{the mineral}} classes {{detected}} may have formed in environments suitable (i.e., enough {{water and the}} proper pH) for life. The mineral smectite (a phyllosilicate) forms in near-neutral waters. Phyllosilicates and carbonates are good for preserving organic matter, so they may contain evidence of past life. Sulfate deposits preserve chemical and morphological fossils, and fossils of microorganisms form in iron oxides like hematite. The presence of <b>opaline</b> silica points toward a hydrothermal environment that could support life. Silica is also excellent for preserving evidence of microbes.|$|E
25|$|The {{scarlet-chested parrot}} is {{becoming}} more common in captivity, {{and is one of}} the more popular species of the genus Neophema in captivity both in Australia and overseas. Their quiet temperament and small size increase their appeal as aviary birds. Many mutations are seen, including the red-fronted, par blue, sea green (Sydney Blue), white fronted blue (Recessive), cinnamon (sex-linked), and more rarely lutino and fallow. <b>Opaline</b> (sex-link) and Edged (dominant) mutations are also now available in most countries. Although the species has more mutations than any other member of the genus, they tend to be frail healthwise and short-lived. Scarlet-chested parrots are also vulnerable to Candida infections in aviculture.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Opaline</b> silica {{and iron}} {{sulphate}} minerals form in acidic (low pH) solutions.

5000|$|They {{are found}} almost {{exclusively}} in the large intestine and cloaca.

It was an autumn day with an <b>opaline</b> atmosphere, a veiled, semi-opaque, lustrous day, with fiery points and flashes of red sunlight on the roofs and windows opposite, while the trees of the square with all their leaves gone were like tracings of indian ink on a sheet of tissue paper. It was one of those London days that have the charm of mysterious amenity, of fascinating softness.

60|$|Moreover, in the fresh-water {{rotten-stone}} beds of Bilin, Ehrenberg had traced out the metamorphosis, effected apparently by {{the action}} of percolating water, of the primitively loose and friable deposit of organized particles, in which the silex exists in the hydrated or soluble condition.

5000|$|Mr Terrill, {{who lived}} near Adelaide, paired the hen to a Blue Silver (the Australian {{name at the}} time for the variety now known as Dilute Skyblue or White) and bred three cocks and a hen in 1934, all Light Green in appearance.

The first two pairings {{produced}} six <b>Opalines,</b> all hens, and the third several <b>Opalines,</b> both cocks and hens. [...] The name 'Opaline' was suggested in 1936 by Mr R J Byfield of Hobart, Tasmania, on being particularly impressed by the vividness of colour shown by these young birds in nest feather.

50|$|The {{complete}} {{renovation of}} the Bouillon Racine took place in 1996 thanks to the Compagnons du Tour de France. It then called upon old expertise of almost lost techniques and skills. Bevelled mirrors, painted <b>opalines,</b> stained glass, carved woodworks, marble mosaics and gold-leaf lettering provide the public with the pleasure of a rich place, as much by its beauty as by its conviviality.

40|$|Although {{the genus}} Blastocystis is only little known, it has {{recently}} {{attracted much attention}} of protistologists and parasitologists.

60|$|Wind in hidden gullies, and {{the talk}} of lapsing waters on the hillside, filled all the spaces of the night. The high-road lay at my feet, fifty yards or so below my boulder.

60|$|While we {{were still}} on very high ground, and before the descent toward Argentière began, we looked up toward a {{neighboring}} mountain-top, and saw exquisite prismatic colors playing about some white clouds which were so delicate as to almost resemble gossamer webs. The faint pinks and greens were peculiarly beautiful; none of the colors were deep, they were the lightest shades. They were bewitching commingled. We sat down to study and enjoy this singular spectacle. The tints remained during several minutes--flitting, changing, melting into each other; paling almost away for a moment, then reflushing--a shifting, restless, unstable succession of soft <b>opaline</b> gleams, shimmering over that air film of white cloud, and {{turning it into a}} fabric dainty enough to clothe an angel with.|$|E

50|$|Sexual and asexual phases in larval anuran host. Once cysts are {{eaten by}} {{foraging}} tadpoles, they excyst (hatch) to yield gamonts. The gamonts divide further, including a meiotic division, to yield haploid gametes. Each gamete {{has only one}} nucleus and may be either a microgamete or a macrogamete. Conjugation occurs between one microgamete and one macrogamate, to yield a diploid zygocyst with one nucleus. The zygocyst has two possible fates. It may be shed along with the feces of the tadpole host; and if eaten by another tadpole, it will excyst (hatch) to yield more gamonts in the new host. Alternatively, the zygocyst may excyst in its original host and grow into a multinucleate protrophont. In this case, the protrophont grows into a trophont and the whole cycle starts over again. The cycle from protrophont to cyst may occur in either the tadpole or adult hosts. Some {{evidence suggests that the}} life cycle transitions of <b>opalines</b> may be governed by the hormonal cycles of the host.|$|R
