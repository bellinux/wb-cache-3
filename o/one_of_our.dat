5|$|A {{spiral galaxy}} is {{organized}} into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a prominent bulge or {{bar at the}} center, and trailing bright arms that spiral outward. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint. Spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by a halo of older stars. Both the Milky Way and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> nearest galaxy neighbors, the Andromeda Galaxy, are spiral galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Before the Dawn is beautifully done, a grand {{genealogy}} {{of modern}} humanity, rooted in fact but spiced with an appropriate measure of speculation and hypothesis.

This is a brilliant book, by <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> best science journalists.|$|E

5|$|WHEN {{on board}} HMS Beagle, as naturalist, I was much struck with certain {{facts in the}} {{distribution}} of the inhabitants of South America, and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent.

5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> favourite tracks.|$|E
5|$|Consuls {{were each}} {{assigned}} {{two of the}} four legions to command, rarely employing all four legions at once to the same assignment. However, the Senate feared a real threat and not only deployed all four legions to the field but all eight, including allies. Ordinarily, each of the two consuls would command his own portion of the army, but since the two armies were combined into one, Roman law required them to alternate their command on a daily basis. The traditional account puts Varro in command {{on the day of the}} battle, and much of the blame for the defeat has been laid on his shoulders. However, his low origins seem to be exaggerated in the sources, and Varro may have been made a scapegoat by the aristocratic establishment. He lacked the powerful descendants that Paullus had, descendants who were willing and able to protect his reputation— most notably, Paullus was the grandfather of Scipio Aemilianus, the patron of Polybius (<b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> main sources of this history).|$|E

5|$|My father... was {{the richest}} man in Palestine. He marketed about ten percent of all the citrus crops sent from Palestine to Europe—especially to England and Germany. He owned a summer house in Marseilles, France, and another house in İskenderun, then in Syria and {{afterwards}} Turkey, and a number of houses in Palestine itself. Most of the time we lived in Jaffa. Our house had about twenty rooms, and we children would go down to swim in the sea. We also had stables with Arabian horses, and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> homes in Ashkelon even had a large swimming pool. I think we must have been the only family in Palestine with a private swimming pool.|$|E
5|$|We {{always start}} out with a musical idea. Great effort goes into {{creating}} a solid melodic core. We both play the keyboards and program, but in general Mikkel plays the instruments and controls Pro Tools, while Tor has the executive overlook as well as lyrical input. However, we both are hands on and have no rules or limitations. When we have some killer beats and musical starting points, we hook up with <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> favorite topline writers, who gets cracking on the lyrics and melody. We make sure there's a lot of melody in the track, so it can inspire the writer. Together with the topline writer we work, often tweek and simplify the song, and never quit before we feel we've got a killer hook.|$|E
5|$|While {{the speech}} {{revolves}} around the life of Neaira, this is of little importance to {{the substance of the}} accusations. The details seem {{to be part of the}} speech in the hope that the salacious accusations will hide the weakness of Apollodorus' case. The accuracy of the evidence given in the speech has been questioned, and is known to contain both lies and inaccuracies. Despite this, the speech tells us much about the life of an accomplished hetaera, and is extremely valuable to historians as a source on women's lives in classical Greece. Indeed, it is our most reliable extant source on prostitution in the classical world, and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> best sources on women's lives and gender relations in general for the period.|$|E

40|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ours,</b> {{published}} in 1922, won the Pulitzer Prize, {{but only after}} it received mixed reviews, ranging from 2 ̆ 2 amazingly rich 2 ̆ 2 to 2 ̆ 2 deadly dull. 2 ̆ 2 Throughout her life, Cather considered it her favorite although critics liked it least of her novels. The disparity between critical versus public response and between its official devaluation versus its writer 2 ̆ 7 s high regard prompted me to explore <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ours</b> 2 ̆ 7 2 ̆ 2 story. 2 ̆ 2 ^ Employing an historical approach, this dissertation attempts to illuminate and clarify <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ours</b> by locating it as an historical element, by studying its sources, and by tracing its composition. Using a biographical approach, I trace Cather 2 ̆ 7 s life {{as it relates to}} the novel, then broadening the questions of historical criticism, I interpret how the novel reflects the historical forces that influenced it. ^ My historical approach reflects principles of new historicism. The novel invites the questions of the feminist critic, exploring the role of gender in its composition and reception. Briefly touching on psychoanalytical criticism, I suggest avenues in which Claude 2 ̆ 7 s, as well as others 2 ̆ 7, actions and motives parallel those of Cather and the American culture. Because the war defined much of American culture during the years portrayed in the novel, I interpret ways in which culture influenced both the novel 2 ̆ 7 s plot and its reception. ^ By examining Cather 2 ̆ 7 s development of stories of male duality, beginning with Alexander 2 ̆ 7 s Bridge, continuing through four stories in Youth and the Bright Medusa, and followed by The Professor 2 ̆ 7 s House, I place <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ours</b> within Cather 2 ̆ 7 s oeuvre. ^ In a broader context, I show how <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ours</b> fits into an American literary context of post-war novels, specifically The Age of Innocence and Babbitt, that examine changes in American society immediately after the war. ^ Finally, I move to a pedagogical approach as I relate my use of the novel in the classroom and ways in which students develop their critical responses to it. ...|$|R
