40|$|The new bus <b>operation</b> <b>mode</b> {{has been}} {{implemented}} in Macao from 1 st August, 2011 onwards. In the new <b>operation</b> <b>mode,</b> Government becomes the operator of all bus routes while bus companies have switched their roles to service providers. The major {{objective of this}} new bus <b>operation</b> <b>mode</b> is to enhance bus ridership and minimize the uses of private vehicles. This objective {{has come to the}} main aim of this dissertation, which is to investigate whether the new bus <b>operation</b> <b>mode</b> has achieved the Government’s targets by analyzing the impacts on residents’ transportation mode choices after the change of bus <b>operation</b> <b>mode.</b> This study is essential to the Government because it can be a milestone for the Transport Bureau {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the new bus <b>operation</b> <b>mode</b> so as to arrange the public transportation system to fulfill the needs of the residents. If public transportation is considered as safe, convenient and efficient, local citizens will be more willing to ride on public transportation instead of private vehicles. Questionnaire survey and interview had been applied in this study. There were four main findings from the questionnaire. Firstly, the most influential factors affecting Macao residents to make mode choices are time and distance. Secondly, residents are less satisfied with the new bus <b>operation</b> <b>mode</b> compared to the old bus <b>operation</b> <b>mode</b> in terms of the satisfaction scores ranked by the respondents while significant differences in satisfaction scores towards different bus operators are recorded. Thirdly, the new bus <b>operation</b> <b>mode</b> is not effective for the time being from the perspective of the respondents. Fourthly, nearly none commuters driving their own cars or motorcycles to commute before the new bus <b>operation</b> <b>mode</b> are willing to change to buses after the commencement of the new bus <b>operation</b> <b>mode.</b> In other words, it can be concluded that the new bus <b>operation</b> <b>mode</b> does not increase ridership on buses, especially for commuters who drive their own vehicles to commute. The main reasons for the currently ineffectiveness of new bus <b>operation</b> <b>mode</b> are the high expectations for the new bus <b>operation</b> <b>mode</b> and the negative impacts caused by the increase of bus frequency. In order to change the public belief that the bus services are still not reliable and effective, the Transport Bureau in Macao has to apply measures to rebuild the confidence of bus passengers on bus services and to reduce the travel time on bus journeys. Once these suggested measures are implemented, passengers will be more willing to ride on buses and the targets of the new bus <b>operation</b> <b>mode</b> can be achieved. published_or_final_versionUrban Planning and DesignMasterMaster of Science in Urban Plannin...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: if {{the power}} system is {{disturbed}} {{by a large}} disturbance, its damping characteristics would change due to the nonlinear factor during the dynamic process and the redistribution of power flow after the accident <b>operation</b> <b>mode.</b> In this paper, the impact of <b>operation</b> <b>mode</b> after an accident and the nonlinear factor for large disturbance dynamic stability of grid are studied respectively. And then, by simulation comparison, it concludes that if nonlinear parts of automatic regulating devices have little impact on the grid damping characteristics after the grid suffers large disturbance, large disturbance dynamic stability of grid is mainly determined by the grid damping characteristics under <b>operation</b> <b>mode</b> after an accident. Finally, conclusions are verified through a practical <b>operation</b> <b>mode</b> of North China Power Grid according to simulation...|$|R
