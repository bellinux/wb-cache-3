25|$|The {{left hand}} panel's frame is inscribed {{with the words}} MELOS DEO LAUS ("Music in Praise of God"), the frame of to the right with LAUDATE EUM IN CORDIS ET <b>ORGANO</b> ("Praise him with {{stringed}} instruments and organs"). A number of art historians have defined the figures as angels based on their positioning and role within the overall context of the registers. They are sexless and possess cherub faces, which contrast with the realistic depictions of the other full-sized non-divine females in the work; Eve in the same register and Lysbette Borluut in the outer panels. The angels are dressed in elaborately brocaded ecclesiastical copes or chasubles, mostly painted in reds and greens. Their robes indicate that they are intended as representative of the celebration of mass before the altar in the lower central panel.|$|E

In this respect, Alkan was a key source of inspiration; Sorabji admired his [...] "orchestral" [...] writing for the piano and was influenced by his Concerto for Solo Piano and his Symphony for Solo Piano.|$|E

500|$|The cantata is {{structured}} in eight movements and takes about 28 minutes to perform. The instrumentation reflects the festive occasion {{for which it}} was written. Bach scored the work for four vocal soloists (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T) and bass) (B), a four-part choir, and a Baroque orchestra of three trumpets (Tr), timpani (Ti), two oboes (Ob), two violins (Vl) (violin solo in movement 3), violas (Va), an obbligato organ (Org) and basso continuo (Bc). The autograph score is titled: [...] "Bey der Rahts-Wahl / 1731. / Wir dancken dir, Gott, wir dancken dir. / à / 4 Voci. / 3 Trombe / Tamburi / 2 Hautbois / 2 Violini / Viola / e / Continuo / con <b>Organo</b> obligato / di / Joh.Seb:Bach.|$|E
500|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements, {{beginning with}} chorale fantasia, {{followed by a}} series of alternating recitatives and arias and concluded by a chorale. He scored it for three vocal soloists (soprano (S), tenor (T) and bass (B)), violins (Vl), two [...] violas (Va), and basso continuo (Bc), including cello (Vc) and bassoon (Fg). The autograph score is titled: [...] "Dominica 1. Adventus Xsti. / Nun komm der Heyden Heyland. / â [...] / due Violini / due Viole / Violoncello / è & / Fagotto. / Sopr: Alto. Tenore è Baßo / Col' / <b>Organo.</b> / da / Joh Sebast Bach / anno. / 1714". The duration is given as 18 minutes. According to the Bach scholar Christoph Wolff, the use of two viola parts is French style. Dürr notes that perhaps the strings were doubled by oboes, at least in the Leipzig performance, in a practise that was [...] "not always marked in the score".|$|E

2500|$|Glass {{containers}} typically receive two surface coatings, {{one at the}} hot end, {{just before}} annealing and one at the cold end just after annealing. At the hot end a very thin layer [...] of tin(IV) oxide is applied either using a safe organic compound or inorganic stannic chloride. Tin based systems {{are not the only}} ones used, although the most popular. Titanium tetrachloride or <b>organo</b> titanates can also be used. In all cases the coating renders the surface of the glass more adhesive to the cold end coating. At the cold end a layer of typically, polyethylene wax, is applied via a water based emulsion. This makes the glass slippery, protecting it from scratching and stopping containers from sticking together when they are moved on a conveyor. The resultant invisible combined coating gives a virtually unscratchable surface to the glass. Due to reduction of in-service surface damage, the coatings often are described as strengtheners, however a more correct definition might be strength-retaining coatings.|$|E
2500|$|In 1910 Larramendi {{decided to}} run on Traditionalist ticket for the Cortes; as he was {{unrelated}} to Asturias, {{it is not clear}} why he chose the district of Oviedo.

The following year he tried his chances in local elections in Valencia; this time banking on support of local Carlists like [...] and , the latter running a daily Diario de Valencia; the bid proved unsuccessful. In Madrid he engaged in launching a periodical of Traditionalist youth, which eventually materialized as Juventud – <b>Organo</b> de las Juventudes Tradicionalistas. Given lack of broader Carlist base in Madrid the initiative proved to be short-lived, and the weekly was issued in 1912-1913 only. Nevertheless, Larramendi was already well known among conservative youth of the capital: [...] "quién no conoce al simpático y cultisimo Larramendi?" [...] – asked one of the periodicals. With ease of writing, by the mid-1910s he supplied Carlist periodicals as far as Tortosa, Castellón, Alicante and Badajoz, let alone other titles in Madrid.|$|E
6000|$|I {{should have}} been glad to meet the author of these {{delightful}} histories, but in his absence we fared well enough with the sacristan. When, {{a few hours before}} we left Verona, we came for a last look it the beautiful sepulchres, he recognized us, and seeing a sketch-book in the party, he invited us within the inclosure again, and then ran and fetched chairs for us to sit upon--nay, even placed chairs for us to rest our feet on. Winning and exuberant courtesy of the Italian race! If I had never acknowledged it before, I must do homage to it now, remembering the sweetness of the sacristans and custodians of Verona. They were all men of the most sympathetic natures. He at San Zenone seemed never to have met with real friends till we expressed pleasure in the magnificent Mantegna, which is the pride of his church. [...] "What coloring!" [...] he cried, and then triumphantly took us into the crypt: [...] "What a magnificent crypt! What works they executed in those days, there!" [...] At San Giorgio Maggiore, where there are a Tintoretto and a Veronese, and four horrible swindling big pictures by Romanino, I discovered to my great dismay that I had in my pocket but five soldi, which I offered with much abasement and many apologies to the sacristan; but he received them {{as if they had been}} so many napoleons, prayed me not to speak of embarrassment, and declared that his labors in our behalf had been nothing but pleasure. At Santa Maria in <b>Organo,</b> where are the wonderful intagli of Fra Giovanni da Verona, the sacristan fully shared our sorrow that the best pictures could not be unveiled as it was Holy Week. He was also moved with us at the gradual decay of the intagli, and led us to believe that, to a man of so much sensibility, the general ruinous state of the church was an inexpressible affliction; and we rejoiced for his sake that it should possess at least one piece of art in perfect repair. This was a modern work, that day exposed for the first time, and it represented in a group of wooden figures The Death of St. Joseph. The Virgin and Christ supported the dying saint on either hand; and as the whole was vividly colored, and rays of glory in pink and yellow gauze descended upon Joseph's head, nothing could have been more impressive.|$|E

40|$|In {{the western}} European towns the {{presence}} {{of members of the}} nobility in their institutions of local government was not a very widespread phenomenon during the Late Middle Ages. It can only be perceived in a great scale in very few regions, mainly in the kingdom of Castile and in Italy. In this article the author gives account of the main signs of the political control that the nobility exercised over the institutions of local government in the Castilian towns. He then pays attention to the important differences that in this respect existed during the Late Middle Ages between these towns and those of other kingdoms of western Europe, where the nobility didn't participate in the institutions of local government. He proposes some exemples taken from the kingdoms of the Crown of Aragon, the German Empire, France and England, leaving out of his consideration the case of the urban republics in Italy because of their specifical character, derived from their important degree of autonomy. En las ciudades de la Europa occidental durante el período bajomedieval la presencia de miembros de la nobleza en los <b>órganos</b> de gobierno local fue un fenómeno poco frecuente, que sólo se constata a gran escala en unos pocos ámbitos, de entre los que cabe destacar dos: la Corona de Castilla e Italia. En este artículo el autor da cuenta de las principales manifestaciones del control político ejercido por la nobleza sobre los <b>órganos</b> de gobierno de las ciudades castellanas. Y presta atención a las importantes diferencias que a este respecto se dieron en los siglos bajomedievales entre estas ciudades y las de otros reinos europeos occidentales, donde la nobleza no participó en los <b>órganos</b> de gobierno urbano.
