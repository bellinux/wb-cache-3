5|$|Trollope refused. Hugo's {{novel was}} {{published}} in The Gentleman's Magazine, beginning in May 1869. However, {{by the end of}} June, the sale of <b>Once</b> <b>A</b> <b>Week</b> <b>to</b> a new publisher was in progress. Rather than serialising The Vicar in the magazine, Bradbury and Evans issued it in eleven monthly shilling numbers, running from July 1869 to May 1870. Trollope could not object to this mode of independent publication; but it was one that had fallen out of favour with the public, and Trollope suffered a loss of reputation and readership as a result. He also suffered a pecuniary loss of £300, agreeing for reasons unspecified to accept only £2500 for the novel.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{while working}} as a model, Blank was scouted by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) {{official}} John Laurinaitis, who was interested in signing her to a contract. As a result, WWE contacted her modeling agency and invited her to their then-developmental territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), for a tryout. Despite having no previous wrestling experience, she was offered a contract, which she signed in May 2006. Even after being called up to WWE's main roster, she continued to fly back and forth to OVW's base of Louisville, Kentucky <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>to</b> work shows; first as a ring announcer and referee, then as a wrestler. One of her first matches took place at the September 6 television tapings, where she participated in a Divas battle royal, which was won by ODB. In late 2007, she also made appearance in Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), another developmental territory.|$|E

The School Council, which met <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>to</b> plan school activities, consisted of seven students, three administrators, and three faculty.

25|$|Outpatient {{treatment}} involves periodic {{visits to}} a psychiatrist for consultation {{in his or her}} office, or at a community-based outpatient clinic. Initial appointments, at which the psychiatrist conducts a psychiatric assessment or evaluation of the patient, are typically 45 to 75 minutes in length. Follow-up appointments are generally shorter in duration, i.e., 15 to 30 minutes, with a focus on making medication adjustments, reviewing potential medication interactions, considering the impact of other medical disorders on the patient's mental and emotional functioning, and counseling patients regarding changes they might make to facilitate healing and remission of symptoms (e.g., exercise, cognitive therapy techniques, sleep hygiene—to name just a few). The frequency with which a psychiatrist sees people in treatment varies widely, from <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>to</b> twice a year, depending on the type, severity and stability of each person's condition, and depending on what the clinician and patient decide would be best.|$|E
25|$|The dalem is an {{enclosed}} structure typically subdivided along a north-south axis into different domains. In {{the case of}} kampung and limasan models this is a simple distinction between {{the front and rear}} parts of the omah, but in joglo houses, a more complex division is used to divide the front, middle, and back of the house. The dalem is often dark, lit only by light from the doorway. The eastern part of the front portion of the dalem is where family chores are performed and where {{all the members of the}} family sleep, on a large bamboo bed, prior to the puberty of the children. The middle section of the dalem in joglo houses is defined by the four principal house posts which forms the tumpang sari of the joglo roof. In modern day, the area has no specific usage, but traditionally, this area was where incense was burnt <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>to</b> honor the rice goddess Sri. The space below the tumpang sari is also the place where the bride and bridegroom are seated during their marriage ceremony.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after moving}} into this {{location}} the people running it began subjecting Genie to extreme {{physical and psychological}} abuse, causing her language skills to rapidly regress and making her return to her coping mechanism of silence. The incident with the largest impact occurred when they severely beat her for vomiting {{and told her that}} if she did it again she would never see her mother, which rapidly accelerated her regression and made her extremely scared of opening her mouth for anything, including speaking, out of fear of vomiting and facing more punishment. As she still wanted to communicate with people she knew, she began almost exclusively using the sign language she learned while living with the Riglers. During this time Curtiss was the only person who had worked with Genie to have any regular contact with her, meeting <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>to</b> continue testing, and she wrote that Genie's language skills severely deteriorated due to the abuse she endured. Curtiss later recalled that during this time Genie frenetically signed to her on a variety of topics, but said she could not bring herself to open her mouth so she could speak. At one point, she refused to talk for five months.|$|E

500|$|Trimmer also {{founded and}} oversaw charity schools in her neighborhood. She {{directed}} promising students from her Sunday schools, which met only <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> <b>to</b> these charity schools, which met {{several times a}} week. As she wrote in her journal, these schools seemed to her to [...] "afford a happy prospect of rescuing many poor children from vice and profligacy". While the Sunday schools were funded by subscription, that is, donations from people within the parish, the charity schools were largely funded by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge (SPCK), which had funded the first charity schools around a century earlier. Trimmer criticized the rote learning {{that went on in}} traditional charity schools and tried to institute a more dynamic catechetical method in her own schools that would stimulate students to ask questions. She wrote in her journal, [...] "my earnest desire is to compose a course of teaching for Charity Schools, by which the children may learn in reality, and not by rote, the principles of the Christian Religion, as taught in the Scriptures". Trimmer also established schools of industry to which she directed her less promising pupils. These schools would teach girls, for example, how to knit and spin. Initially, Trimmer believed that the schools would turn a profit since the girls would spin and knit all day long; however, the girls were unskilled and turned out poor products that could not be sold. Trimmer viewed this project as a failure.|$|E
500|$|Takeda {{was first}} shown the project while {{still working on}} Xenosaga: The Animation, a work load he {{estimated}} at six months. Once work on the anime had finished, Takeda and Takahashi began work on the script. Takahashi created the draft based on his original plans for the Xenosaga storyline, which had needed substantial alteration for the original Episode I and Episode II due to both design and time limitations. The scenario for Episode I required little alteration as it was relatively unaltered from Takahashi's initial draft. For Episode II, more substantial alterations were made such as rearranging flashback sequences so the story would maintain an uninterrupted flow, and greatly expanding information concerning the Immigrant Fleet faction and the origins of central character Jr.. During the [...] "beta" [...] period of script development, the scenario for Episode II only made up 30% of the whole game, which {{was seen as a}} drastic imbalance requiring rewrites to address it. To better connect the two storylines, characters from Episode II were given minor cameos within the events of Episode I. A major change was the shift to the viewpoint of main protagonist Shion Uzuki, as Episode II originally portrayed events from the perspective of Jr., a concession that enabled events to be fleshed out. Despite these changes, keeping the narrative consistent with the in-development Xenosaga Episode III was a necessity. Ultimately the scenario came close to what Takahashi originally intended for Episode I and Episode II. The total writing work on Xenosaga I & II lasted over six months, with Takeda needing to visit Monolith Soft's offices <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>to</b> discuss the script.|$|E

500|$|The {{recording}} and release of Neighborhoods was delayed multiple times. The recording's delay {{was due to}} the way the band chose to work — in bits and pieces, alone and together, in a pair of California studios — in addition to each member's busy schedules. The album was recorded at both DeLonge's studio in San Diego and in Los Angeles by Hoppus and Barker. [...] Recording in separate studios was DeLonge's idea, and ideas were exchanged via e-mail. Various engineers met up in person to trade files on hard drives. Although the three musicians were rarely in the same room while recording, opting to work on their parts individually, DeLonge asserted that the method of recording was a more efficient way of working considering the schedules, not {{due to a lack of}} unity within the band. In addition, Barker was releasing a solo record, DeLonge was involved in Angels & Airwaves, and Hoppus had to fly to New York City <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>to</b> film his television show, Hoppus on Music. The record was the band's first to be self-produced, due to the death of long-time producer Jerry Finn in 2008. Not only did Finn helm their last three studio albums, but he served as an invaluable member of the band: part adviser, part impartial observer, he helped smooth out tensions and hone their sound. [...] "I honestly still feel like he’s in the studio with us, because for me, personally, everything that was about {{recording and}} being in a studio, I learned from Jerry," [...] said Hoppus. Instead of a producer, each band member had their own dedicated sound engineer. DeLonge, who was against using a producer after self-producing most of his Angels & Airwaves records, described the band situation as [...] "very democratic," [...] noting that he learned during the recording process to [...] "let go and be okay with not being able to control everything." ...|$|E
