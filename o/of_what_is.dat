40|$|Surgical {{results can}} be {{assessed}} as a function <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> aimed for, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> done, and <b>what</b> <b>was</b> achieved.

5|$|According to the 1st and 2nd century {{geographer}} Ptolemy, Deva was in {{the lands}} of the Cornovii. Their land bordered that of the Brigantes {{in the north and}} the Ordovices in the west and included parts <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now Cheshire, Shropshire, and north Wales. When the Romans' treaty with the Brigantes– who occupied most <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now Northern England– failed the Romans embarked on military conquest of the area. The campaigns were initially led by Sextus Julius Frontinus and later Gnaeus Julius Agricola. Their expansion into the north of Britannia during the reign of Vespasian meant that the Romans needed a new military base. Chester was a strategic site for a fortress, commanding access to the sea via the River Dee and dividing the Brigantes from the Ordovices. Legio II Adiutrix was sent to Chester and began the construction of a legionary fortress in the mid AD70s.|$|E
