5|$|Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455 U.S. 130 (1982), {{was a case}} {{in which}} the Supreme Court of the United States holding that an Indian tribe has the {{authority}} to impose taxes on non-Indians that are conducting business <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> as an inherent power under their tribal sovereignty.|$|E
5|$|The case arose when a Minnesota county taxed an Indian's {{mobile home}} located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation.</b> The Court {{ruled that the}} state {{did not have the}} {{authority}} to impose such a tax or, more generally, to regulate behavior <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation.</b> Bryan has become a landmark case that has led to Indian gaming on reservations and altered the economic status of almost every Indian tribe. Later decisions, citing Bryan, ruled that Public Law 280 allows states to enact prohibitions, or crimes, that would apply on reservations, but could not impose regulations on conduct that was otherwise allowed. The case has also called into question the ability of the states to impose any sort of regulations on tribal reservations, such as labor standards and certain traffic regulations.|$|E
5|$|As the {{particularly}} severe {{winter of}} 1922–23 started to close in, Marquis considered {{that the task}} had gone from difficult to impossible. He resigned his post and returned to Whitehall on September27, having spent only ten weeks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation.</b> He arrived {{back in time to}} attend the wedding of his daughter Minnie-Ellen.|$|E
50|$|As of 2000 {{there were}} around 2,000 {{enrolled}} {{members in the}} tribe, with over 1,300 living <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservations.</b> <b>The</b> Tribe includes some Black Seminoles, including 50 living on Fort Pierce Reservation.|$|R
50|$|The Dawes Act of 1887 was {{an effort}} to {{integrate}} Indians into the mainstream; the majority accepted integration and were absorbed into American society, leaving a trace of Indian ancestry in millions of American families. Those who refused to assimilate remained in poverty <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservations,</b> supported by Federal food, medicine and schooling. In 1934, U.S. policy was reversed again by the Indian Reorganization Act which attempted to protect tribal and communal life <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservations.</b>|$|R
25|$|The coal field {{received}} {{increased attention}} beginning in 1950 when the Navajo - Hopi Long Range Rehabilitation Act was enacted {{in response to}} dire economic conditions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservations.</b> <b>The</b> Act promoted economic development and better utilization of the reservations’ natural resources.|$|R
5|$|In August 1874, Carpenter became {{involved}} in fighting at Anadarko Reservation, Wichita, Indian Territory. This fighting is considered {{the first of many}} clashes during the Red River War (1874–75). Carpenter, with Troops H & I was sent to support Fort Sill and by using aggressive patrols engaged several Kiowa and Comanche raiding parties. The relatively peaceful Wichita Indians <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> were targets of the hostile Indians because of their increasing positive status under pacification.|$|E
5|$|As of 2005, South Dakota has {{the lowest}} per capita total state tax rate in the United States. The state does not levy {{personal}} or corporate income taxes, inheritance taxes, or taxes on intangible personal property. The state sales tax rate is 4.5 percent. Various localities have local levies so in some areas the rate is 6 percent. The state sales tax {{does not apply to}} sales to Indians on Indian reservations, but many reservations have a compact with the state. Businesses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> collect the tax and the state refunds to the Indian Tribes the percentage of sales tax collections relating to the ratio of Indian population to total population in the county or area affected. Ad valorem property taxes are local taxes and are a large source of funding for school systems, counties, municipalities and other local government units. The South Dakota Special Tax Division regulates some taxes including cigarette and alcohol-related taxes.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this period that Marquis became {{interested}} in the Battle of the Little Bighorn and the death of Custer. This interest became an obsession that was to last the rest of his life. The battle site was only twenty-five miles to the west on the Crow Indian Reservation. All the participants of the battle on the US side had died in action, but very little had been published in the way of Indian accounts. Most information had come from soldiers who only witnessed the aftermath. Marquis realized that {{there were a number of}} Cheyenne participants of the battle still alive <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation.</b> However, interviewing them at length seemed too difficult at this time. There was the language barrier, and Marquis was busy as a doctor trying to cover a large area.|$|E
50|$|In 1856, the U.S. {{government}} forcibly relocated the Takelma {{who survived}} the Rogue Indian Wars to <b>the</b> Coast Indian <b>Reservation</b> (today <b>the</b> Siletz <b>Reservation)</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rainy northern Oregon coast, an environment {{much different from the}} dry oak and chaparral country that they knew. Many died <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way to <b>the</b> Siletz <b>Reservation</b> and <b>the</b> Grand Ronde Indian Reservation, which now exists as Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon. And many died <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservations</b> from disease, despair and inadequate diet. Indian agents taught the surviving Takelma farming skills and discouraged them from speaking their own language, believing that their best chance for productive lives depended on their learning useful skills and <b>the</b> English language. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservations,</b> <b>the</b> Takelma lived with Native Americans from different cultures; and their intermarriage with people of other cultures, both <b>on</b> and off <b>the</b> <b>reservation,</b> worked against <b>the</b> transmission of Takelman language and culture to Takelman descendants.|$|R
50|$|He is also Director of the Native American Youth Leadership Alliance, {{working to}} build youth leaders {{among the people}} of <b>the</b> <b>reservations.</b> He has noted that a high {{percentage}} of residents <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservations</b> are under age 18.|$|R
50|$|In 1904, the {{government}} of the United States debated over finding a home for the Chippewa of Montana <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Flathead <b>Reservation,</b> but <b>the</b> bill was not ratified. Rocky Boy was obviously upset about the failure and those Chippewa living <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Flathead <b>Reservation,</b> even more so. They would continue to live <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Flathead <b>Reservation</b> as Rocky Boy continued the quest to find a new <b>Reservation</b> for <b>the</b> landless Chippewa of Montana. The Chippewa of <b>the</b> Flathead <b>Reservation</b> were not <b>the</b> only tribe to be forced by the United States to assimilate among the Kootenai and Salish, so were the Nez Perce. Though the attempt by Rocky Boy to preserve the Chippewa Tribal Status <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Flathead <b>Reservation</b> failed, today over 100 Chippewa are still clinging to their Anishinabe identity <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Flathead <b>Reservation.</b>|$|R
5|$|Prior to the {{establishment}} of the Wind River Indian Reservation, the U.S. Cavalry constructed Fort Brown <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> lands, which was subsequently renamed Fort Washakie. During the late 19th century, the fort was staffed by African-American members of the U.S. Cavalry, better known as the Buffalo Soldiers, including the second African-American graduated from the United States Military Academy, John Hanks Alexander. Chief Washakie is buried at the fort, which is located immediately east of the forest boundary. Rumor has it that Sacajawea, the Shoshone Indian who provided invaluable assistance to Meriwether Lewis and William Clark during the Lewis and Clark Expedition, is also buried here, but it is now considered that this is unlikely and that her actual burial place was Fort Lisa in North Dakota.|$|E
5|$|Russell Bryan was an {{enrolled}} {{member of}} the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, which is a component band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. He married Helen Charwood in 1957. Helen was an enrolled {{member of the}} Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe, which was {{also a part of}} the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. They raised their children on reservation land and lived in a mobile home which they purchased in 1971. The mobile home was located on the Greater Leech Lake Indian Reservation near Squaw Lake in Itasca County, Minnesota. Bryan's mobile home, had it not been <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation,</b> would have been subject to taxes from Itasca County. In June 1972, Itasca County notified Bryan that the mobile home was subject to US$147.95 in taxes. The Bryans could not afford to pay the tax, and contacted the Leech Lake Reservation Legal Services Project (Legal Services) for help, noting that the mobile home was on Indian land.|$|E
25|$|Tribal {{census data}} from 1999 {{show that the}} Makah Tribe has 1,214 {{enrolled}} members; some 1,079 live <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation.</b> The unemployment rate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> is approximately 51%.|$|E
50|$|Whilst {{the electoral}} {{fortunes}} of the party in East Pakistan was highly dependent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservations</b> for minority communities, the party politically opposed communal reservation of assembly seats.|$|R
25|$|With the aid {{of federal}} troops, Neighbors managed to protect <b>the</b> Indians <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservations,</b> {{successfully}} thwarting an attack on 23 May 1859 by John Baylor and 250 marauders.|$|R
50|$|Due to poor living {{conditions}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservations,</b> <b>the</b> Lakota struggled greatly to survive. In some cases, Indian agents were corrupt, undertaking fraud and stealing Lakota supplies/annuities. By 1889 {{they were in}} despair, and looked for change.|$|R
25|$|Rinehart {{replaced}} Samuel B. Parrish, who {{was well}} respected by the Native American people living <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation.</b> In contrast to Parrish’s administration, Rinehart was in continuous {{conflict with the}} Native Americans living <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> {{from the time he}} arrived. According to Sarah Winnemucca, he required the native residents to turn their crops over to the government and then issued government ration to them. This often left reservation farmers with less food than they produced. Two senior chiefs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation,</b> Egan and Oytes, also complained that Rinehart illegally sold liqueur to reservation residents. When white settlers began grazing their livestock on reservation lands, Rinehart made no effort to evict them. He even allowed one rancher to cut timber <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> without requiring any payment.|$|E

5000|$|The loss of {{this land}} had a {{dramatic}} effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Indians who lived <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservations.</b> Most of <b>the</b> land was unable to be harvested (to allow the trees to be cut down for wood, etc.) before the land was flooded over with water. [...] One visitor to <b>the</b> <b>reservations</b> later asked why there were so few older Indians <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservations,</b> {{and was told that}} [...] "the old people had died of heartache" [...] after the construction of the dam and the loss of the reservations' land. As of 2015, poverty remains a problem for the displaced populations in the Dakotas, who are still seeking compensation for the loss of the towns submerged under Lake Oahe, and the loss of their traditional ways of life.|$|R
5000|$|Three {{reservations}} {{were acquired}} for Fort Church 1939-1942, which was initially named the Sakonnet Point Military <b>Reservation.</b> <b>The</b> West <b>Reservation</b> was at <b>the</b> Sakonnet Golf Club, <b>the</b> East <b>Reservation</b> was near Briggs Marsh and South Main Road, and <b>the</b> South <b>Reservation</b> was near Sakonnet Point itself. Battery Gray, or Battery Construction Number (BCN) 107, was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> West <b>Reservation</b> {{and had two}} 16-inch guns. Battery Reilly was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> East <b>Reservation</b> with two casemated 8-inch guns. BCN 212 with two 6-inch guns was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> South <b>Reservation,</b> along with two [...] "Panama mounts" [...] (circular concrete platforms) for towed 155 mm guns.|$|R
5000|$|They {{also have}} the small Passamaquoddy Pleasant Point <b>Reservation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Passamaquoddy Bay, between Eastport, Maine and Perry, Maine. The {{population}} was 749 at the 2010 census. Most of the tribe's nearly 3700 members do not live <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservations.</b>|$|R
25|$|The 2010 census {{reported}} {{a population of}} 10,405 living <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> lands. The population density is 3.47 people per square mile (1.34 people/km²).|$|E
25|$|Afterward, as the {{remaining}} Kiowa {{went to the}} reservation, the younger Dohäsan lived {{with his family in}} peace <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> near Fort Sill until his death.|$|E
25|$|Power outages {{began with}} a storm in December {{knocking}} down around 5,000 power poles, and was accelerated by an ice storm Jan. 22 knocking down another 3,000 power lines <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation.</b>|$|E
50|$|As a {{term for}} woman squaw has been carried over the length and breadth of the United States and in Canada, and is even in use by Indians <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservations</b> of <b>the</b> W., who have taken it from the whites.|$|R
50|$|Simultaneously, {{almost every}} Christian {{denomination}} opened churches <b>on</b> or near <b>the</b> <b>reservations</b> and actively tried {{to convert the}} Indians away from their own traditions. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> Crow <b>reservation</b> each family was arbitrarily assigned {{to become a member}} of one of the churches.|$|R
50|$|The tribe {{has since}} become more open to intermarriage. It also permits non-tribal spouses (including white or black) to live <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservations,</b> unlike in earlier times. It {{requires}} tribal members to have a documented blood quantum of at least one-quarter Seminole ancestry.|$|R
25|$|After graduation, he and Mitch McVicker {{moved to}} a Navajo {{reservation}} in Tse Bonito, New Mexico to teach music to children. Rich and McVicker {{lived in a small}} hogan <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> until Mullin's death in 1997.|$|E
25|$|In 1893, two Wisconsin Synod missionaries {{began work}} in Arizona at Peridot and Old San Carlos in the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation among the Apache people. Congregations were soon established. Currently {{there are nine}} Wisconsin Synod congregations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{stress of}} the {{relocation}} is credited as a contributing factor to the divorce of Denomie's parents, {{and he went to}} live with his mother, at the age of five, in Minneapolis. In the summers and winters he visited his grandparents <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Fry Bread House is a {{restaurant}} in Phoenix, Arizona, serving Indian fry bread, a Native American staple made from white flour, baking powder, salt and lard or Crisco. The ingredients reflect the commodities doled out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservations</b> by <b>the</b> U.S. federal government.|$|R
5000|$|The short two-year {{terms of}} office can make it {{difficult}} for elected officials to carry out projects over the long term. In addition, BIA officials and police retain roles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservations,</b> which <b>the</b> historian Akim Reinhardt calls a form of [...] "indirect colonialism".|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of main-stream dams also affected other Native American tribes living along <b>the</b> Missouri River <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Fort Berthold, Cheyenne River, Standing Rock, Crow Creek, and Lower Brule Indian <b>reservations.</b> <b>The</b> Garrison, Oahe, and Fort Randall dams created a reservoir that eliminated 90 percent of timber and 75 percent of wildlife <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservations.</b>|$|R
