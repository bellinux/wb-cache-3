500|$|In 1807, the United States {{government}} {{bought the}} [...] of land {{upon which the}} lighthouse stands from Daniel Fayerweather for $200. The government appropriated $5000 for the light station in February 1807 and contracted Abisha Woodward to construct the light. The first Black Rock Harbor Light was a 40-foot (12.1 meter) octagonal wooden tower built in 1808. Abisha Woodward, who previously constructed the 1801 New London Harbor Light and the 1802 Falkner Island Light, constructed a wooden tower that was lit and made operational by October 1808. The lightkeeper's home was a small -story home built {{on the opposite side}} of a marsh, several hundred feet away from the tower. Another brick structure was built to house the oil. [...] The total cost of the wooden lighthouse, and likely the accompanying keeper's house and <b>oil</b> <b>house,</b> was listed at $4604.69.|$|E
2500|$|The {{light has}} an {{attached}} fog signal building, <b>oil</b> <b>house</b> and storage building. [...] There are davits {{to raise and}} lower boats.|$|E
2500|$|An <b>oil</b> <b>house</b> {{was built}} in 1904, in order to {{properly}} store the flammable materials used to illuminate the light. [...] Aside from the lighthouse and the <b>oil</b> <b>house,</b> no other structure has survived to the present day. [...] The mound of earth that formed {{the foundation of the}} outer battery appears as none other than a sand dune– no other hint of the early settlement, the military post, nor the oil factory can be found on Long Point today.|$|E

50|$|Built in 1890, Cape Meares Light {{served as}} the light station for Tillamook Bay. When it was built, the {{lighthouse}} complex included two keeper's <b>houses,</b> two <b>oil</b> <b>houses,</b> and two cisterns, and {{was connected to the}} light by a 1000 ft boardwalk. Later additions included an attached workroom in 1895 and a garage in 1934. The light itself was iron-plated, and due to its exposure to the elements, it required frequent repainting over the years. No foghorn was ever installed at Cape Meares. In 1934, the light received electricity. Now unnecessary, the <b>oil</b> <b>houses</b> were removed.|$|R
2500|$|Other {{historic}} structures: an 1861 steel lamp <b>oil</b> <b>house</b> and a 1910 alcohol {{house have}} remained on the site since they were constructed. [...] They were used to store fuel sources for the light before it was electrified in 1931.|$|E
2500|$|The Port Sanilac Light complex {{currently}} {{consists of}} five historic structures. [...] In {{addition to the}} light tower and ornate brick Lighthouse keeper's residence, the brick <b>oil</b> <b>house,</b> wooden outhouse, and well also survive. [...] The well is covered by a safety platform of wooden planks.|$|E
2500|$|The {{lighthouse}} was decommissioned {{and torn}} down in 1947, {{replaced by a}} skeleton tower. [...] The keeper's house was also destroyed. [...] This tower continues to exhibit a white flashing light, visible for , from [...] above sea level. [...] The only surviving structure from the lighthouse station is a stone <b>oil</b> <b>house,</b> and its door and roof are missing.|$|E
2500|$|Buildings at the lightstation {{included}} {{the tower and}} dwelling, fog signal building, boat <b>house,</b> barn, three <b>oil</b> <b>houses,</b> two privy's and a Diaphone fog signal. [...] The fog signal building fell into the lake due to erosion in 1943.|$|R

50|$|A {{previous}} skeletal, wooden {{structure was}} constructed in 1891 has since been demolished. Historical brick Queen Anne style keepers quarters (1896) are collocated with the current lighthouse.

50|$|In 1896 {{a wooden}} keeper’s house was built, {{as well as}} a storage shed and <b>oil</b> <b>house.</b> Unfortunately with the {{changing}} times and no need to man the light station it was decided in 1961 to raze the buildings leaving just the tower and <b>oil</b> <b>house.</b>|$|E

The project is about a design improvement of industrialcompact mixers. This project is accomplished with Xylem, one of the main suppliers of compact mixers in theindustry, located at Emmaboda, Sweden. The company has a problem with the existing designof the two part, <b>oil</b> <b>housing</b> and entrance cover, in 4610 / 20 compact mixers. The 4610 / 20 compact mixers has suffered from quality problems which affect the production and the endcustomer because of the existing design of these part. The aim {{of this study is to}} improve thequality of the product by redesigning of <b>oil</b> <b>housing</b> and entrance cover. In addition to theredesigning of these parts, another important purpose of the project is to produce these partsfrom different material than existing one. The computer aided design programs are widely used, Solid Works, during the project. Forselection of a new material a wide literature research has been accomplished...|$|R
