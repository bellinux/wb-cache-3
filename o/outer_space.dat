5|$|<b>Outer</b> <b>space,</b> also simply called space, {{refers to}} the {{relatively}} empty regions of the universe outside the atmospheres of celestial bodies. <b>Outer</b> <b>space</b> is used to distinguish it from airspace (and terrestrial locations). There is no discrete boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and space, as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude. <b>Outer</b> <b>space</b> within the Solar System is called interplanetary space, which passes over into interstellar space at {{what is known as}} the heliopause.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Outer</b> <b>Space</b> Treaty {{provides}} the basic framework for international space law. It covers the legal use of <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> by nation states, and includes in its definition of <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> the Moon and other celestial bodies. The treaty states that <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> is free for all nation states {{to explore and}} {{is not subject to}} claims of national sovereignty. It also prohibits the deployment of nuclear weapons in <b>outer</b> <b>space.</b> The treaty was passed by the United Nations General Assembly in 1963 and signed in 1967 by the USSR, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. As of January 1, 2008 the treaty has been ratified by 98 states and signed by an additional 27 states.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1958, <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> {{has been}} the subject of {{multiple}} resolutions by the United Nations General Assembly. Of these, more than 50 have been concerning the international co-operation in the peaceful uses of <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> and preventing an arms race in space. Four additional space law treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the UN's Committee on the Peaceful Uses of <b>Outer</b> <b>Space.</b> Still, there remains no legal prohibition against deploying conventional weapons in space, and anti-satellite weapons have been successfully tested by the US, USSR and China. The 1979 Moon Treaty turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies (including the orbits around such bodies) over to the international community. However, this treaty has not been ratified by any nation that currently practices manned spaceflight.|$|E

40|$|During {{the process}} of {{accessing}} services provided within urban interior and <b>outer</b> <b>spaces</b> the elderly and disabled individuals encounter with a myriad of problems due to the limitations posed by structured environments. This limitation hinders elderly and disabled individuals from mobility without assistance, which in turn negatively affects their full participation to urban and social life. Rearrangement of urban spaces {{to meet the needs}} of elderly and disabled individuals would correspondingly bolster life quality of the entire range of users. Within the scope of present research, as mandated by universal design principles to stick to plans and designs approaches inclusive for all users, it is aimed to conduct evaluations on the use of urban <b>outer</b> <b>spaces</b> situated within Konya city center. In the hypothetical and theoretical part of this paper, the perception of disability throughout historical process has been examined from a sociological perspective. In addition, concept of universal design, its principles and gravity have also been elaborated. In the part dealing with the case study, <b>outer</b> <b>spaces</b> within Konya city center have been analyzed with respect to universal design principles and a range of suggestions have been developed...|$|R

5|$|Jonathan Gems, who had {{previously}} written multiple unproduced screenplays for director Tim Burton, came up with his own idea for a Mars Attacks film in 1993. The writer pitched both concepts of Mars Attacks and Dinosaurs Attack! to Burton, who both decided that Dinosaurs Attack! would be too similar to Jurassic Park (1993). Burton, who was busy preparing Ed Wood (1994), believed that Mars Attacks! would be a perfect opportunity {{to pay homage to}} the films of Edward D. Wood, Jr., especially Plan 9 from <b>Outer</b> <b>Space</b> (1959), and other 1950s science fiction B movies, such as Invaders from Mars (1953), It Came from <b>Outer</b> <b>Space</b> (1953), The War of the Worlds (1953), Target Earth (1954), Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) and Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (1956).|$|E

50|$|Frequently, {{the main}} belt's armor plates were {{supplemented}} with a torpedo bulkhead spaced several meters behind the main belt, designed {{to maintain the}} ship's watertight integrity even if the main belt was penetrated. Furthermore, the <b>outer</b> <b>spaces</b> around the main belt in some designs were filled with storage tanks that could contain fuel oil, seawater, or fresh water. The liquids in these tanks absorb or scatter much of the explosive force of warheads and shells. In other designs, the <b>outer</b> <b>spaces</b> were left empty, allowing some the initial blast wave to dissipate, while the inner liquid layers then absorbed shrapnel and spread the shock wave out over a larger area. To deal with the leakage from the tanks and incoming seawater, an armored holding bulkhead prevented liquid from entering {{other parts of the}} ship. This multilayer design is featured in the cross-sectional drawings of Tirpitz and King George V.|$|R

5|$|<b>Outer</b> <b>space</b> is {{the closest}} known {{approximation}} to a perfect vacuum. It has effectively no friction, allowing stars, planets and moons to move freely along their ideal orbits. However, even the deep vacuum of intergalactic space is not devoid of matter, as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter. By comparison, the air humans breathe contains about 1025 molecules per cubic meter. The low density of matter in <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered: the mean free path of a photon in intergalactic space is about 1023km, or 10 billion light years. In spite of this, extinction, which is the absorption and scattering of photons by dust and gas, {{is an important factor}} in galactic and intergalactic astronomy.|$|E
