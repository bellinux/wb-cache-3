Emmanuel Rivoire increased the resolution to 1280×800 pixels and Chahi created more detailed backgrounds.

The game still supports the original 320×200 resolution, as well as the original background art (as an <b>option),</b> <b>and</b> it features twice as many checkpoints as the original, which makes it somewhat easier, as well as newly remixed sounds.|$|E
5|$|Air is {{a romance}} visual novel {{in which the}} player assumes the role of three characters. Much of its {{gameplay}} is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue.

However, if the player reaches a bad end to a storyline, the player does not have this <b>option</b> <b>and</b> must reload the game at the last saved point.|$|E

The increased commissioning of wind power is being accompanied by record low prices for forthcoming renewable electric power.

To resolve such problems, this paper proposes a system framework for dynamic integration of <b>options</b> <b>and</b> algorithms based on the model management system perspective. Specifically, the detailed mapping relationships between the parameters of <b>options</b> <b>and</b> those of algorithms are managed with a separate mapping table, so the addition or the modification is easily incorporated only with altering the table withou...|$|R

At 16:00, on August 29, Washington held a meeting with his generals.

5|$|Following the season, the Rangers did not {{exercise}} their <b>option,</b> <b>and</b> traded Fleury's playing {{rights to the}} San Jose Sharks, which entitled the Sharks to a compensatory draft pick if Fleury signed elsewhere.

Two days prior {{to the opening of}} the 2002–03 season, he was suspended by the NHL for violating the terms of the league's substance abuse program. The Blackhawks hired one of Fleury's friends, also a recovering alcoholic, to ensure that he attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and abided by the terms of the NHL's aftercare program.|$|E

Theobald of Blois, his close ally, may have also felt that he was in favour with Henry. William Clito, who was King Louis's preferred choice, remained opposed to Henry and was therefore unsuitable. Henry may have also considered his own illegitimate son, Robert of Gloucester, as a possible candidate, but English tradition and custom would have looked unfavourably on this.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{the game}} was {{developed}} on natural grass turf. However, in 1976, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) made artificial pitches mandatory at all major competitions. The 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal {{was the first of}} these; however at this time few players had seen or played on synthetic pitches. Although it is still permissible to play on natural turf all national competitions and international matches must be played on an artificial surface. Elite-level competitions, such as the Olympic Games and World Cup, require a water-based playing surface. However, due to water conservation efforts, this is not seen as a long-term sustainable <b>option</b> <b>and</b> alternative elite surfaces that do not require water are being researched.|$|E

Perry promoted the third <b>option</b> <b>and</b> Arthur Meighen, the acting Minister for Justice, therefore proposed merging the mounted police and the Dominion Police, placing them under Perry's command. This idea was turned down by Borden, who believed, incorrectly, that the merger would be unacceptable to Perry, whom he thought still wanted a military future for the force.|$|E

5|$|Phimosis is the {{inability}} to retract the foreskin over the glans penis. At birth, the foreskin cannot be retracted due to adhesions between the foreskin and glans, and this is considered normal (physiological phimosis). Over time the foreskin naturally separates from the glans, {{and a majority of}} boys are able to retract the foreskin by age three. Less than one percent are still having problems at age 18. If {{the inability}} to do so becomes problematic (pathological phimosis) circumcision is a treatment option. This pathological phimosis may be due to scarring from the skin disease balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO), repeated episodes of balanoposthitis or forced retraction of the foreskin. Steroid creams are also a reasonable <b>option</b> <b>and</b> may prevent the need for surgery including in those with mild BXO. The procedure may also be used to prevent the development of phimosis. Phimosis is also a complication that can result from circumcision.|$|E
5|$|Safety {{features}} on Lexus models range from {{stability and handling}} programs (Vehicle Stability Control and Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management) to backup cameras, swivel headlights, and sonar warning systems. The Lexus Pre-Collision System (PCS) integrates multiple safety systems. In 2007, Lexus introduced the first car safety systems with infrared and pedestrian detection capabilities, lane keep assist, a Driver Monitoring System with facial recognition monitoring of driver attentiveness, and rear pre-collision whiplash protection, {{as part of the}} LS 460 PCS. As a safety precaution, Lexus GPS navigation systems in many regions feature a motion lockout when the vehicle reaches a set speed; to prevent distraction, navigation inputs are limited, while voice input and certain buttons are still accessible. This safety feature has attracted criticism because passengers cannot use certain functions when the vehicle is in motion. Pre-2007 models came with a hidden manufacturer override <b>option,</b> <b>and</b> updated European models allow operation in motion.|$|E
