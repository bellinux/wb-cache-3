40|$|Two natural ideas we {{have about}} {{justification}} are that we are justified by basing our beliefs on good reasons, rather than wishful thinking or blind prejudice, and that justification makes our beliefs objectively likely to be true. Despite their appeal, respecting both of these ideas is impossible if we think that <b>one's</b> <b>reasons</b> for belief are determined entirely by one's psychological states, such as one's beliefs and experiences, and not by how the world is around <b>one.</b> If <b>one's</b> <b>reasons</b> are isolated from the world, it seems {{that they could not}} make our beliefs likely to be true. This is why the debate between epistemic internalists, who think that justification is determined just by states of the believer, and externalists, who deny this, seems so intractable. Internalists are motivated by the intuition that justification is determined by the subject's reasons for belief, whereas externalists are motivated by the intuition that justification makes our beliefs objectively likely to be true. I argue that the key to resolving this dispute is to reject the view that <b>one's</b> <b>reasons</b> are determined entirely by one's psychological states in favor of the view that <b>one's</b> <b>reasons</b> are facts - including facts of the world around one. We can then accept both the idea that justification is a matter of the subject's reasons for belief and the idea that justification makes one's beliefs objectively likely to be true. On this view <b>one's</b> <b>reasons</b> (the facts of the world around us) can make one's beliefs likely to be true. The result is a theory of justification that captures the motivations both of traditional forms of internalism and traditional forms of externalism, while avoiding the characteristic problems those views face...|$|R

5|$|Conversely, DST can {{adversely}} affect farmers, parents of young children, and others whose hours are {{set by the}} sun and they have traditionally opposed the practice, although some farmers are neutral. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> why farmers oppose DST is that grain is best harvested after dew evaporates, so when field hands arrive and leave earlier in summer their labor is less valuable. Dairy farmers are another group who complain of the change. Their cows {{are sensitive to the}} timing of milking, so delivering milk earlier disrupts their systems. Today some farmers' groups are in favor of DST.|$|E

5|$|Ecology is {{the study}} of the {{distribution}} and abundance of living organisms, the interaction between them and their environment. An organism shares an environment that includes other organisms and biotic factors as well as local abiotic factors (non-living) such as climate and ecology. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> that biological systems can be difficult to study is that so many different interactions with other organisms and the environment are possible, even on small scales. A microscopic bacterium responding to a local sugar gradient is responding to its environment as much as a lion searching for food in the African savanna. For any species, behaviors can be co-operative, competitive, parasitic, or symbiotic. Matters become more complex when two or more species interact in an ecosystem.|$|E

40|$|There are two {{approaches}} to reasoning about distributed algorithms.

On the one hand, operational reasoning about events and causality affords an intuitive way to think about and understand distributed algorithms. On the other hand, assertional proof techniques allow such intuitive understanding to be used to guide and structure formal correctness proofs.

There are no extant drawings or descriptions of machinery and sets for the Restoration theatre, although some documentation exists for court masques from {{the first half of the}} 17th century, notably the work of Inigo Jones and his pupil John Webb. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> for the lack of information for the public theatres is that stage effects, and particularly machines, were trade secrets.

5|$|In Africa, the HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} {{has been}} the major cause of falling life expectancy. There is currently a crisis of decreasing number of available care workers for an increasing population requiring care. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> why this phenomenon occurs is because HIV/AIDS affects working age people the most, {{and there has been}} evidence to show that women are affected at a younger age and in greater numbers. Another reason is due to the influx of HIV/AIDS, government-led health policies are breaking down, increasing the amount of care work and community work that women have to do. Because of the lack of care workers available, the very young and the very old have also started participating in care work, resulting in poorer quality of care.|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} with the concentration of activity within the Dairi, the Greater Palace began {{to be regarded as}} increasingly unsafe, especially by night. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> may be the prevalent superstition of the period: uninhabited buildings were avoided for fear of spirits and ghosts, and even the great Buraku-in compound was thought to be haunted. In addition, the level of actual security maintained at the palace went into decline, and by the early 11th century only one palace gate, the Yōmeimon in the east, appears to have been guarded. Hence burglary and even violent crime became a problem within the palace by the first half of 11th century.|$|E
