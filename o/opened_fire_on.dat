5|$|No. 4 Commando {{made the}} {{crossing}} to Dieppe on board HMS Prins Albert. The crossing was uneventful and at 04:50 just before daybreak Group one landed unopposed. Using two Bangalore torpedos to blow {{a hole in}} the barbed wire, they managed to scale the cliffs. As they approached the battery at 05:45 it <b>opened</b> <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> the main landing force coming ashore at Dieppe. This was 30 minutes before Group one was expected {{to be in a position}} but Mills-Roberts responded by speeding up the advance to get their guns into action sooner. Once in position they <b>opened</b> <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> the battery with their mortars, Bren machine guns and sniper rifles.

5|$|Severely damaged, Topaze {{was unable}} to {{effectively}} respond, the only serious danger to the British ships coming from the battery onshore. By 17:10 Jason and Hazard had joined Cleopatra, the brig bombarding the battery while Jason <b>opened</b> <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> {{the other side of}} the French ship, causing further damage. Recognising that his situation was hopeless, Lahalle surrendered at 17:20. As the French colours fell, approximately a third of the 430 soldiers and sailors on board Topaze attempted to escape captivity by diving overboard and swimming for the shore. Many drowned, and more were killed when Jason <b>opened</b> <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> the swimmers, although exact losses in the water are unknown. The remainder of the survivors, including Lahalle, totalled almost 300 men and were all made prisoners of war. The badly damaged Topaze was towed out of the bay and taken to a British port for repairs.|$|E

5|$|Abu Nidal's {{most infamous}} {{operation}} was the 1985 {{attack on the}} Rome and Vienna airports. On 27 December, at 08:15 GMT, four gunmen <b>opened</b> <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> the El Al ticket counter at the Leonardo Da Vinci International Airport in Rome, killing 16 and wounding 99. In Vienna International Airport a few minutes later, three men threw hand grenades at passengers waiting to check into a flight to Tel Aviv, killing four and wounding 39. According to Seale, the gunmen had been told the people in civilian clothes at the check-in counter were Israeli pilots returning from a training mission.|$|E
5|$|At 15:00 Lhermitte {{ordered the}} masts on Preneuse {{to be cut}} away and the frigate and battery then <b>opened</b> <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> Adamant, which was {{carefully}} sailing through the coastal shoals {{in an effort to}} engage the beached French ship. For more than two hours Hotham's ship worked its way inshore until at 17:30 it was well positioned to open fire, unleashing its broadside on the wrecked Preneuse. By 17:45 it was clear that further resistance was futile and Lhermitte struck his colours. Preneuse had surrendered, but was likely damaged beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|Between 17:48 and 17:52, 11 German dreadnoughts, {{including}} Rheinland, {{engaged and}} <b>opened</b> <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> the British 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, though {{the range and}} poor visibility prevented effective fire, which was soon checked. Some ten minutes later Rheinland again <b>opened</b> <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> the British cruisers, targeting what was most likely , though without success. By 20:15, the German fleet had faced the deployed Grand Fleet {{for a second time}} and was forced to turn away; in doing so, the order of the German line was reversed, with Rheinland third from the front, behind Westfalen and Nassau. At 21:22, crewmen aboard Rheinland and Westfalen, the two leading ships in the German line, spotted two torpedo tracks {{that turned out to be}} imaginary. The ships were then forced to slow down in order to allow the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group to pass ahead. Around 22:00, Rheinland and Westfalen observed unidentified light forces in the gathering darkness. After flashing a challenge via searchlight that was ignored, the two ships turned away to starboard in order to evade any torpedoes that might have been fired. The rest of I Battle Squadron followed them.|$|E
