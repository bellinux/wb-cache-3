5|$|Patrick {{gets on the}} bus to go {{home but}} accidentally leaves SpongeBob behind. After several {{unsuccessful}} attempts {{to get on the}} bus, SpongeBob heads to a bus station and waits in a very long line. By the time he reaches the front, he finds out that the next bus leaves in 5 seconds; he misses it, then learns that it was the last one and he is stuck there until morning. He becomes frightened by a raspberry sound coming from <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance,</b> and he dashes back to the cliff in terror. Finally, the raspberry sound's maker is revealed to be a friendly-looking anglerfish creature, who has retrieved SpongeBob's glove balloon. The creature blows up the balloon and ties it to SpongeBob's wrist, which allows him to rise up the cliff and float back to Bikini Bottom. The episode ends with Patrick {{on his way back to}} Rock Bottom, thinking SpongeBob is still there.|$|E

25|$|After {{witnessing}} {{the death of}} Conquering Bear at the Grattan massacre, Crazy Horse began to get trance visions. Curly went out on a vision quest to seek guidance but without going through the traditional procedures first. In his vision, a warrior on his horse rode out of a lake and the horse seemed to float and dance throughout the vision. He wore simple clothing, no face paint, his hair down with just a feather in it, and a small brown stone behind his ear. Bullets and arrows flew around him as he charged forward, but {{neither he nor his}} horse were hit. A thunderstorm came over the warrior, and his people grabbed hold of his arms trying to hold him back. The warrior broke their hold and then lightning struck him, leaving a lightning symbol on his cheek, and white marks like hailstones appeared on his body. The warrior told Curly that as long he dressed modestly, his tribesmen did not touch him, and he did not take any scalps or war trophies, then he would not be harmed in battle. As the vision ended, he heard a red-tailed hawk shrieking <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance.</b> Curly’s father later interpreted the vision and said that the warrior was going to be him. The lightning bolt on his cheek and the hailstones on his body were to become his war paint. Curly was to follow the warrior’s role to dress modestly and to do as the warrior's prophecy said so he would be unharmed in battle. For the most part, the vision was true and Crazy Horse was rarely harmed in battle, except for when he was struck by an arrow after taking two enemy scalps. He was shot in the face by No Water when Little Big Man tried to hold Crazy Horse back to prevent a fight from breaking out, and he was held back by one of his tribesmen—according to some reports, Little Big Man himself—when he was stabbed by a bayonet the night he died.|$|E

25|$|The second Indian raid was {{conducted}} on the same target by eight Canberras led by Wing Commander Surinder Singh, which again left the airport's terminal and other buildings untouched. Two transport aircraft—a Lockheed Constellation belonging to the Portuguese airline TAP and a Douglas DC-4 belonging to the Goan airline TAIP—were parked on the apron. On the night of 18 December, the Portuguese used both aircraft to evacuate the families of some government and military officials <b>in</b> spite of <b>the</b> heavily damaged runway. During the first hours of the evening, airport workers hastily recovered part of the runway. The first aircraft to leave was the TAP Constellation commanded by Manuel Correia Reis, which took off using only 700 metres; the debris from the runway damaged the fuselage with 25 holes and a flat tire. To take <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short <b>distance,</b> <b>the</b> TAP pilots had jettisoned all the extra seats and other unwanted equipment so that they could do a 'short take-off'.

Rob Evanoff of All About Jazz called the song [...] "an uplifting soul ride", and stated that it evokes an image of [...] "a musical train seen far <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance,</b> slowly getting bigger as it gets closer". Evanoff also compared the track's style to the jam-sound of Pink Floyd, and wrote [...] "it surrounds you with a deep thick infectious groove that, at first, shadows and then envelopes your senses {{in such a way}} that is equal bits liberating, intoxicating and hypnotic…you close your eyes and are transported into another dimension". On the song's lyrics, one critic wrote that [...] "D'Angelo disses all neo-soul wannabes by calmly singing 'Bring the drama playa/Give me all U got'". [...] "Devil's Pie" [...] is a funk and hip hop diatribe with a lyrical theme concerning hip hop excess, and it is accompanied by P-Funk style harmonies and low-key singing by D'Angelo. It is a bass-driven track produced by DJ Premier, who contributes to its hip hop texture. The song's theme also incorporates religious imagery into its message of social strife.

500|$|Following the {{shoreline}} beginning at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi on the bay's southeastern peninsula, {{the features of}} the bay can be best described. Moving northwest from the air station, Oso Bay must be crossed at its confluence with Corpus Christi Bay. On {{the other side of the}} meeting is Ward Island (actually a peninsula), where Texas A University–Corpus Christi is found. Further northwest, the shore begins to curve and <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> across the bay, the skyline of Corpus Christi is visible. Following the shore, the land dips inward and forms Emerald Cove, where a seawall has been constructed. Out in the bay, the Alta Vista Reef can be spotted from this location. Moving north along the shore, the seawall continues into the main city, until it reaches Industrial Canal, which has been dredged south of Nueces Bay and extends into the main bay to Port Aransas. [...] Another seawall, which starts in Emerald Cove with gaps at places such as a spoils island that can be viewed in the bay and the canal, is slightly out in the water. This seawall ends when it reaches land at the southern portion of Corpus Christi Beach. North of the canal, Corpus Christi Beach is found along the shore to Rincon Point, where Corpus Christi Bay opens to Nueces Bay and must be crossed using the Nueces Bay Causeway to Indian Point near Portland, from where Indian Reef juts from offshore. Past Portland, the shore curves to the southeast where the large La Quinta Island forms on the backdrop of industrial plants in Ingleside. The La Quinta Channel has been dredged between the island and the shore and meets the Jewell Fulton canal at the confluence of Kinney Bayou. Ingleside Cove is formed in this area between La Quinta Island and an island named Ingleside Point. The shore then curves to the southwest where Ingleside on the Bay is located on southern shore of the bay's northeastern peninsula. To the southeast, a series of islands form the boundary between Corpus Christi and Redfish Bays.|$|E
60|$|As I {{threw my}} eyes {{along the edge}} of the surf I {{remember}} that I was startled, as Robinson Crusoe might have been, by the sense that human life was within the magic circle of my solitude. Afar <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> remote <b>distance</b> of <b>the</b> beach, appearing like sea-nymphs, or some airier things such as might tread upon the feathery spray, was a group of girls. Hardly had I beheld them, when they passed into the shadow of the rocks and vanished. To comfort myself--for truly I would fain have gazed a while longer--I made acquaintance with a flock of beach-birds. These little citizens of the sea and air preceded me by about a stone's-throw along the strand, seeking, I suppose, for food upon its margin. Yet, with a philosophy which mankind would do well to imitate, they drew a continual pleasure from their toil for a subsistence. The sea was each little bird's great playmate. They chased it downward as it swept back, and again ran up swiftly before the impending wave, which sometimes overtook them and bore them off their feet. But they floated as lightly as one of their own feathers on <b>the</b> breaking crest. <b>In</b> their airy flutterings they seemed to rest on the evanescent spray. Their images--long-legged little figures with gray backs and snowy bosoms--were seen as distinctly as <b>the</b> realities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror of the glistening strand. As I advanced they flew a score or two of yards, and, again alighting, recommenced their dalliance with the surf-wave; and thus they bore me company along the beach, the types of pleasant fantasies, till at its extremity they took wing over the ocean and were gone. After forming a friendship with these small surf-spirits, it is really worth a sigh to find no memorial of them save their multitudinous little tracks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sand.|$|R

As Minnie Mouse backs away with her camera from Mickey, who is posing for the shot, a sultan abducts her from behind a fence.

60|$|A {{hundred and}} seventy {{thousand}} years elapse (as the play-bills put it), {{and then the}} curtain rises afresh upon neolithic Europe. Man meanwhile, loitering somewhere behind <b>the</b> scenes <b>in</b> Asia or Africa (as yet imperfectly explored {{from this point of}} view), had acquired the important arts of sharpening his tomahawks and producing hand-made pottery for his kitchen utensils. When the great ice sheet cleared away he followed the returning summer into Northern Europe, another man, physically, intellectually, and morally, with all the slow accumulations of nearly two thousand centuries (how easily one writes the words! how hard to realise them!) upon his maturer shoulders. Then comes the age of what older antiquaries used to regard as primitive antiquity--the age of the English barrows, of the Danish kitchen middens, of the Swiss lake dwellings. The men who lived in it had domesticated the dog, the cow, the sheep, the goat, and the invaluable pig; they had begun to sow small ancestral wheat and undeveloped barley; they had learnt to weave flax and wear decent clothing: in a word, they had passed from the savage hunting condition to the stage of barbaric herdsmen and agriculturists. That is a comparatively modern period, and yet I suppose we must conclude with Dr. James Geikie that it isn't to be measured by mere calculations of ten or twenty centuries, but of ten or twenty thousand years.

30|$|For the {{conventional}} cellular networks, dynamic switching off of BSs {{has been extensively}} studied in [11, 16, 21 - 26]. A solution proposed in [21] automatically switch off appropriate BSs or sectors, which become the compensation area needed to be covered through the tilting of antennas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neighboring BSs. A novel energy-efficient cellular access network architecture {{based on the principle}} of ecological protocooperation was proposed in [22], which indicates that BSs can cooperatively and dynamically make intelligent decisions based on thresholds for switching between different power modes according to traffic conditions. Similarly, a transmission power increment is required for compensating the areas of switched <b>off</b> BSs. <b>In</b> contrast to these works, the use of coordinated multipoint for MBS switching off without transmission power adjustment from compensating neighboring BSs is presented in [23]. From a game theoretic perspective, the energy efficiency issues in multi-operator mobile networks was studied in [24], where cost-based functions are used to decide the best suitable BSs to remain active. This paper introduces the cost that has to be paid by an operator when its subscribers have to be served by another operator {{due to the fact that}} some BSs have been switched <b>off.</b> <b>In</b> [25], <b>the</b> authors proposed a practical switching on/off-based energy saving algorithm that can be realized distributively. The key principle of the algorithm was to switch off a BS one by one that minimally affect the network by using network impact, which takes into account the additional load increments brought to its neighboring BSs. Distance-based approaches have been developed in [11, 16]. <b>In</b> [11], <b>the</b> authors used two real datasets (i.e., temporal and spatial) to estimate the energy savings, and they used a greedy algorithm by sequentially switching off the BSs with <b>the</b> minimum <b>distance</b> to its nearest active BSs if the coverage is met. A dynamic switching on/off algorithm where the number of active BSs adapts to the network condition was proposed in [16], which was based on BS traffic load and the position of the associated UEs. This algorithm preferentially tests the BS with larger average distance to its associated UEs to be switched off one by one and terminates when UEs of a BS cannot be accepted by <b>the</b> neighboring BSs. <b>In</b> realistic networks, <b>the</b> <b>distances</b> among BSs <b>in</b> homogeneous cellular network can be easily acquired, but the position of UEs may not be easily and accurately acquired. Besides, the policy that the algorithm just stops when one BS fails to transfer its UEs does not seem reasonable as other BSs with larger average distance may be lowly loaded, thus also have the potential to be switched off. It is important to remark that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous works regarding homogeneous cellular network, the decision to switch off BSs was based on either <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> factor or <b>the</b> traffic. However, since we focus on switching <b>off</b> PBSs <b>in</b> Hetnets, <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> between PBS and PUE cannot be accurately or easily obtained due to various reasons, such as technology limits and designing principles. As <b>in</b> some cases, <b>the</b> network side is not aware of the UEs’ position, which is also the desire of <b>the</b> users. Moreover, <b>in</b> addition to <b>the</b> load, other factors such as UEs’ service rate, the historical blocking probability, and the interference conditions should also be considered. Although BS switching off is primarily designed to reduce network energy consumption, it should be noted that the various approaches must ensure that <b>the</b> QoS <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coverage area is not compromised at all times. Emphasizing on this concern, a progressive BS switching on/off technique has been implemented through the coordination of multiple surrounding BSs <b>in</b> [26], where <b>the</b> main finding shows that the duration of BS sleeping and waking up transients is very short, with no significant reduction of the energy savings achievable with sleep mode approaches.|$|R
