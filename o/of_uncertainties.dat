40|$|The Role of Attachment and Intolerance <b>of</b> <b>Uncertainty</b> in the Relationship between Worry and Interpersonal Problems The {{current study}} {{assessed}} a developmental model exploring pathways from attachment problems to interpersonal problems {{in people with}} intolerance <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty,</b> and excessive and uncontrollable worry. The current study utilised Structural Equation Modelling to test a series of paths, including the mediation <b>of</b> intolerance <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> {{on the relationship between}} attachment and worry, as well as the mediation of worry on the relationship between intolerance <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> and interpersonal problems. The current study was able to separate the effects of different variables from interpersonal problems, including intolerance <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> and social anxiety, in order to isolate the effect excessive worry has on interpersonal problems. Results found that, of the attachment subscales of Loved, Role- Reversal/ Enmeshment, and Rejection, only Rejection had a relationship with both excessive worry, and intolerance <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty.</b> This suggests that people with higher levels of rejection during childhood {{were more likely to have}} increased intolerance <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty,</b> and through this, excessive worry. Also, those higher in intolerance <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> were likely to have increased difficulty with being cold and distant, vindictive and self-centered, self- sacrificing, controlling and dominating than those lower on intolerance <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty.</b> However, those higher on excessive and uncontrollable worry were likely to have fewer problems with being cold and distant, vindictive and self- centred than those lower on worry. Additionally, and most interestingly, it was found that those who were higher on intolerance <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> could also have lower levels of being cold and distant, vindictive and self- centred when they also had higher levels of worry. Thus, excessive and uncontrollable worry was a protective factor for those high in intolerance <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> for interpersonal problems...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown that clinically-significant anxiety is {{associated}} with a tendency to apply threat interpretations to stimuli or situations that can plausibly be interpreted in a neutral or benign fashion. Current thinking suggests that biases in appraisal and interpretation are not merely epiphenomena of disorder; but rather, markers and "transmitters" of underlying cognitive vulnerability. Intolerance <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> has been identified as a potential cognitive vulnerability for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), a condition characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry. Individuals who endorse high levels <b>of</b> intolerance <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> hold the view that uncertainty is stressful and upsetting; that uncertainty leads to the inability to take action; that uncertain events are negative and to be avoided; and that being uncertain is unfair. This thesis consists of three independent investigations of the relationship <b>of</b> intolerance <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> to the processing <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty.</b> Using three different paradigms, individuals low and high on intolerance <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> were compared on their appraisals of ambiguous scenarios. Collectively, the findings suggest (1) that individuals high on intolerance <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> appraise ambiguous stimuli and events as less pleasant and more disconcerting relative to individuals low on intolerance of uncertainty; (2) that individuals with high levels <b>of</b> intolerance <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> take longer to evaluate affectively-neutral stimuli compared to individuals with low levels of intolerance of uncertainty; (3) that degree <b>of</b> intolerance <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> is a stronger predictor of appraisals of ambiguous situations than are GAD symptoms and mood variables; (4) that appraisals of ambiguous situations partly mediate the relationship <b>of</b> intolerance <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> to worry; (5) that the appraisals of individuals high on intolerance <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> appear to lack content-specificity; (6) that relative to individuals low on intolerance <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty,</b> those high on intolerance <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> have a greater tendency to use anxious affect as information when appraising potentially threatening situations; and (7) that habitual use of thought suppression is associated with negative appraisals of ambiguous scenarios in individuals high on intolerance <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> only. The findings are discussed within the context of conceptual models of worry and GAD as well as theories of normative decision-making under uncertainty...|$|R

500|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, some African American intellectuals led by Lerone Bennett Jr., {{rejected}} Lincoln's {{role as the}} Great Emancipator. Bennett won wide attention when he called Lincoln a white supremacist in 1968. He noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks. Bennett argued that Lincoln opposed social equality, and proposed sending freed slaves to another country. Defenders, such as authors Dirck and Cashin, retorted {{that he was not}} as bad as most politicians of his day; and that he was a [...] "moral visionary" [...] who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause, as fast as politically possible. The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln-the-emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation. Historian Barry Schwartz wrote in 2009 that Lincoln's image suffered [...] "erosion, fading prestige, benign ridicule" [...] in the late 20th century. On the other hand, Donald opined in his 1996 biography that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability, defined by the poet John Keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were [...] "content in the midst <b>of</b> <b>uncertainties</b> and doubts, and not compelled toward fact or reason".

The paleontologist Thomas Holtz noted that Bakker combined fauna in ways not directly supported by the fossil record; for example, several of the dinosaurs featured in the books lived millions of years after Utahraptor died out. Michael Taylor, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the National Museums of Scotland, panned the book, saying that [...] "Raptor Red is an accurate portrayal only within the context <b>of</b> <b>uncertainties</b> over the reconstruction of fossil animals as living forms ... Bakker's postscript never really admits these uncertainties." [...] David B. Norman criticized the book as [...] "no more than a children's adventure story—and a rather poorly written one at that ... The merging of science and fantasy is at its worst in books like Raptor Red because none but the experts can disentangle fact from fiction; this type of nonsense turns an uninformed reader into a misinformed one." [...] Jay Ingram, from the Discovery Channel, published a rebuttal, saying, [...] "The most {{important point is that}} Bakker's portrayal of the dinosaurs in Raptor Red is vivid—vivid in a way few museum displays or factual accounts can be.
