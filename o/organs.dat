5|$|In {{the first}} volume, the {{specimens}} {{of the cabinet}} were divided into fifteen sections: healthy bones, diseased bones, soft parts about the bones, heart and blood vessels, <b>organs</b> of sense, vocal and respiratory <b>organs,</b> alimentary canal, <b>organs</b> accessory to the alimentary canal, urinary <b>organs,</b> female <b>organs</b> of generation, male <b>organs</b> of generation, utero-gestation, monstrosities, and parasites.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they are}} {{sometimes}} included {{in the category of}} electronic <b>organs,</b> the majority of Hammond <b>organs</b> are, strictly speaking, electric or electromechanical rather than electronic <b>organs,</b> because the sound is produced by moving parts rather than electronic oscillators.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{reproductive}} <b>organs</b> include testicles and ovaries. In most species, gonads are paired <b>organs</b> {{of similar}} size, {{which can be}} partially or totally fused. There {{may also be a}} range of secondary <b>organs</b> that increase reproductive fitness.|$|E
50|$|The Cathedral {{has a large}} <b>organ</b> {{that was}} {{originally}} built by Geo. Kilgen and Son, Inc. in 1915. Originally, the <b>organ</b> had two four manual (keyboard) <b>organ</b> consoles, one in the gallery with the <b>organ,</b> and another console behind the sanctuary. In 1946, Kilgen put a new <b>organ</b> into the Cathedral. The 1946 <b>organ</b> had 77 ranks of pipes, 14 of which came from the older <b>organ.</b> In 1948, an Echo <b>Organ</b> from Carnegie Hall, New York City was installed in the Cathedral. In 1984, the M. P. Moller <b>organ</b> company refurbished the <b>organ.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the course}} of the renovations, the <b>organ</b> firm Seifert (Kevelaer) are {{constructing}} a new cathedral <b>organ</b> system from the existing <b>organ,</b> consisting of a main <b>organ</b> and a choir <b>organ.</b> The system should be complete for the diocese's 1200th jubilee in 2015. The main <b>organ</b> was dismantled in February 2010 to make way for this new <b>organ.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Minster {{has a new}} <b>organ</b> since 2004. This <b>organ</b> {{was built}} by the renowned <b>organ</b> workshop, Rieger of Schwarzach, which was founded by the <b>organ</b> builder Franz Rieger. The {{instrument}} consists of two <b>organ</b> works, which can be operated by a single console. The <b>organ</b> system has 69 registers altogether (5,102 pipes, 95 <b>organ</b> stops).|$|R
5|$|The {{electronic}} organ developed throughout the 20th century. Some pipe <b>organs</b> {{were replaced by}} digital <b>organs</b> because of their lower purchase price, smaller physical size, and minimal maintenance requirements. In the early 1970s, Rodgers Instruments pioneered the hybrid organ, an electronic instrument that incorporates real pipes; other builders such as Allen <b>Organs</b> and Johannus Orgelbouw have since built hybrid <b>organs.</b>|$|E
5|$|The ninth century {{revealed}} the first bagpipes, which spread throughout Europe and had many uses from folk instruments to military instruments. The construction of pneumatic <b>organs</b> evolved in Europe starting in fifth-century Spain, spreading to England in about 700. The resulting instruments varied {{in size and}} use from portable <b>organs</b> worn around the neck to large pipe <b>organs.</b> Literary accounts of <b>organs</b> being played in English Benedictine abbeys {{toward the end of}} the tenth century are the first references to <b>organs</b> being connected to churches. Reed players of the Middle Ages were limited to oboes; no evidence of clarinets exists during this period.|$|E
5|$|Tympanal <b>organs</b> {{or hearing}} <b>organs</b> {{consist of a}} {{membrane}} (tympanum) stretched across a frame backed by an air sac and associated sensory neurons, are found in two families. Several species of the genus Cicindela (Carabidae) have hearing <b>organs</b> on the dorsal surfaces of their first abdominal segments beneath the wings; two tribes in the Dynastinae (within the Scarabaeidae) have hearing <b>organs</b> just beneath their pronotal shields or neck membranes. Both families are sensitive to ultrasonic frequencies, with strong evidence indicating they function to detect the presence of bats by their ultrasonic echolocation.|$|E

50|$|Today this <b>organ</b> {{may be a}} pipe <b>organ</b> (see above), {{a digital}} or {{electronic}} <b>organ</b> that generates the sound with digital signal processing (DSP) chips, {{or a combination of}} pipes and electronics. It may be called a church <b>organ</b> or classical <b>organ</b> to differentiate it from the theater <b>organ,</b> which is a different style of instrument. However, as classical <b>organ</b> repertoire was developed for the pipe <b>organ</b> and in turn influenced its development, the line between a church and a concert <b>organ</b> became harder to draw.|$|R
5|$|Anatomy can {{be studied}} using both {{invasive}} and non-invasive methods {{with the goal of}} obtaining information about the structure and organization of <b>organs</b> and systems. Methods used include dissection, in which a body is opened and its <b>organs</b> studied, and endoscopy, in which a video camera-equipped instrument is inserted through a small incision in the body wall and used to explore the internal <b>organs</b> and other structures. Angiography using X-rays or magnetic resonance angiography are methods to visualize blood vessels.|$|E

5|$|Cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) {{have a more}} {{advanced}} immune system. They have three specialized <b>organs</b> that are unique to Chondrichthyes; the epigonal <b>organs</b> (lymphoid tissue similar to mammalian bone) that surround the gonads, the Leydig's organ {{within the walls of}} their esophagus, and a spiral valve in their intestine. These <b>organs</b> house typical immune cells (granulocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells). They also possess an identifiable thymus and a well-developed spleen (their most important immune organ) where various lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages develop and are stored.|$|E

During 1939 renovations of the lower church, a new two-manual pipe <b>organ</b> was installed in 1939 by the Aeolian-Skinner <b>Organ</b> Company, Inc. of Boston, Massachusetts, and replaced the Müller & Abel <b>organ.</b> [...] "Sometime after 1970, the chapel was closed and the <b>organ</b> was removed." ...|$|R
5|$|Chemicals {{released}} by macrophages can also damage host tissue. TNF-α {{is an important}} chemical that is {{released by}} macrophages that causes the blood in small vessels to clot to prevent an infection from spreading. However, if a bacterial infection spreads to the blood, TNF-α is released into vital <b>organs,</b> which can cause vasodilation {{and a decrease in}} plasma volume; these in turn can be followed by septic shock. During septic shock, TNF-α release causes a blockage of the small vessels that supply blood to the vital <b>organs,</b> and the <b>organs</b> may fail. Septic shock can lead to death.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{introduced}} {{their first}} integrated circuit (IC) model, the Concorde, in 1971. The company had stopped manufacturing tonewheel <b>organs</b> entirely by 1975, {{due to increased}} financial inefficiency, and switched to making IC models full-time. Console models included the 8000 Aurora (1976) and 8000M Aurora (1977), which contained drawbars and a built-in rotating speaker. Spinet <b>organs</b> included the Romance series, manufactured between 1977 and 1983. In 1979, a Japanese offshoot, Nihon Hammond, introduced the X-5, a portable solid-state clone of the B-3.|$|E
5|$|Hammond-Suzuki {{continues}} to manufacture {{a variety of}} <b>organs</b> for both professional players and churches. Other companies, such as Korg, Roland, and Clavia, have also achieved success in providing more lightweight and portable emulations of the original tonewheel <b>organs.</b> The sound of a tonewheel Hammond can also be emulated using modern software such as Native Instruments B4.|$|E
50|$|Multiple <b>organ</b> {{dysfunction}} syndrome (MODS), {{also known}} as multiple <b>organ</b> failure (MOF), total <b>organ</b> failure (TOF) or multisystem <b>organ</b> failure (MSOF), is altered <b>organ</b> function in an acutely ill patient requiring medical intervention to achieve homeostasis.|$|R
50|$|The church {{contains}} an <b>organ</b> which dated from 1802 by George Pike England. A specification of the <b>organ</b> {{can be found}} on the National Pipe <b>Organ</b> Register.

50|$|During the {{restoration}} of the cathedral, the <b>organ</b> builder Franz Breil (Dorsten) built a new <b>organ</b> with 52 registers in four manuals. The instrument was completed in 1960. As well as the usual works (main <b>organ,</b> chair <b>organ,</b> choir <b>organ</b> and pedals), this <b>organ</b> included a unique feature - a Spanish reed <b>organ</b> with three registers, which could be played from the fourth manual.|$|R

5|$|In 1977, at age 36, Kotok married Judith McCoy, a choir {{director}} and piano teacher {{on the faculty}} of the Longy School of Music. They lived in Harvard, Massachusetts, Cambridge, Massachusetts and Cape May, New Jersey. The couple shared a love of 16th and 17th-century music and pipe <b>organs,</b> and toured historic pipe <b>organs</b> in Sweden, Germany, Italy and Mexico. They had a daughter, Leah Kotok, and two stepchildren from Judith's prior marriage, Frederica and Daryl Beck.|$|E

5|$|In the jawless fish (lampreys and hagfish), true lymphoid <b>organs</b> are absent. These fish rely on {{regions of}} lymphoid tissue within other <b>organs</b> to produce immune cells. For example, erythrocytes, macrophages and plasma cells are {{produced}} in the anterior kidney (or pronephros) and {{some areas of the}} gut (where granulocytes mature.) They resemble primitive bone marrow in hagfish.|$|E
5|$|Instrument {{builders}} developed {{other features}} that endure today. For example, while <b>organs</b> with multiple keyboards and pedals already existed, the first <b>organs</b> with solo stops {{emerged in the}} early fifteenth century. These stops were meant to produce a mixture of timbres, a development needed for the complexity of music of the time. Trumpets evolved into their modern form to improve portability, and players used mutes to properly blend into chamber music.|$|E
5|$|It {{may lead}} to nosebleeds, acute and chronic {{digestive}} tract bleeding, and various problems due to the involvement of other <b>organs.</b> Treatment focuses on reducing bleeding from blood vessel lesions, and sometimes surgery or other targeted interventions to remove arteriovenous malformations in <b>organs.</b> Chronic bleeding often requires iron supplements and sometimes blood transfusions. HHT is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion, and occurs in one in 5,000 people.|$|E
