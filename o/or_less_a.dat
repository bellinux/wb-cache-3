5|$|Fleas {{arose in}} the early Cretaceous, most likely as ectoparasites of mammals, {{before moving on to}} other groups {{including}} birds. Each species of flea is more <b>or</b> <b>less</b> <b>a</b> specialist on its host animal species: many species never breed on any other host, though some are less selective. Some families of fleas are exclusive to a single host group: for example, the Malacopsyllidae are found only on armadillos, the Ischnopsyllidae only on bats, and the Chimaeropsyllidae only on elephant shrews. The oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, is a vector of Yersinia pestis, the bacterium which causes bubonic plague. The disease was spread by rodents such as the black rat, which were bitten by fleas that then infected humans. Major outbreaks included the Plague of Justinian and the Black Death, both of which killed a sizeable fraction of the world's population.|$|E
5|$|The {{flesh of}} the cap {{consists}} {{of a number of}} microscopically distinct layers of tissue. The cuticle of the cap (known as the pileipellis) is between 8–10µm thick, and is made of a loose textura intricata, a type of tissue in which the hyphae are irregularly interwoven with distinct spaces between them. The cuticle hyphae are thick-walled to thin-walled, with scattered inconspicuous cystidia measuring 40–55 by 3.5–5.5µm. These cystidia located in the cap (pileocystidia) are cylindrical, thin-walled, yellow in Melzer's reagent, hyaline in KOH, sometimes with amorphous dingy brown material coating the walls. Beneath the cuticle layer is a zone 54–65µm thick, made of very loosely entwined, thin-walled hyphae, 2–3µm in thickness, with clamps at the septa. Below this is a zone 208–221µm in thickness, in which the densely compacted hyphae, 3–8µm in diameter, have swollen, gelatinized walls, and often more <b>or</b> <b>less</b> <b>a</b> vertical orientation. This in turn is followed by a layer 520µm in thickness, formed of loosely interwoven hyphae, 2–8µm in width, some of which have thin walls with clamps at the septa, whilst others have somewhat thickened gelatinized walls. The {{flesh of the}} cap has a layer of upright hyphae bending into a lower layer of interwoven hyphae with diameters of 2.5–8µm. The flesh of the gills {{is similar to that of}} the lower cap.|$|E

25|$|In {{numerical}} analysis, numerical integration {{constitutes a}} broad family of algorithms for calculating the numerical {{value of a}} definite integral, and by extension, the term is also sometimes {{used to describe the}} numerical solution of differential equations. This article focuses on calculation of definite integrals. The term numerical quadrature (often abbreviated to quadrature) is more <b>or</b> <b>less</b> <b>a</b> synonym for numerical integration, especially as applied to one-dimensional integrals. Some authors refer to numerical integration over more than one dimension as cubature; others take quadrature to include higher-dimensional integration.|$|E

25|$|Not many Michelia {{species have}} so far become horticulturally or {{economically}} important, apart for their wood. Both subgenus Magnolia and subgenus Yulania include species of major horticultural importance, and a change of name would be very undesirable for many people, especially in the horticultural branch. In Europe, Magnolia even is more <b>or</b> <b>less</b> <b>a</b> synonym for Yulania, {{since most of the}} cultivated species on this continent have Magnolia (Yulania) denudata as one of their parents. Most taxonomists who acknowledge close relations between Yulania and Michelia therefore support the third option and join Michelia with Magnolia.|$|E

The cavalry of the Bourbon army {{attacked}} fiercely and were almost successful, but the allied troops stood firm. Then the Allies counter-attacked with their infantry and the Spanish army was pushed back. In less than three hours of battle the Allied army won a complete victory. All the artillery (20 cannons) of the Bourbon army and all their colours (73 flags) were seized. Between 5,000 or 6,000 Spanish soldiers were killed or wounded, and another 7,000 were made prisoners. The Allied losses were put as 1,500 men dead or wounded.|$|E

This was seen as more <b>or</b> <b>less</b> <b>a</b> necessity after prospective top babyface Sid Vicious was involved in an incident with Arn Anderson (which resulted in hospitalization of both men) while on tour in England eight weeks before Starrcade and was fired. Flair then placed his career on the line against Big Van Vader for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Flair won the title at Starrcade and was once again made booker. That did not stop WCW from suffering massive financial losses in 1993, however; a staggering $23 million.|$|E

Minnie was again cast as the local tavern dancer who is abducted by Peg-Leg Pedro (Black Pete in his first appearance with a peg-leg). Mickey again comes to the rescue. The short is considered significant for being the last short featuring Mickey and Minnie to be animated by Ub Iwerks.|$|E

25|$|The Hindu sects Saivism and Vaishnavism became dominant, {{replacing}} {{the prevalence of}} Jainism and Buddhism of the previous era. Saivism was patronised more by the Chola kings and became more <b>or</b> <b>less</b> <b>a</b> state religion. Some of the earliest temples that are still standing were built during this period by the Pallavas. The rock-cut temples in Mamallapuram and the majestic Kailasanatha and Vaikuntaperumal temples of Kanchipuram stand testament to the Pallava art. The Cholas, utilising their prodigious wealth earned through their extensive conquests, built long-lasting stone temples including the great Brihadisvara temple of Thanjavur and exquisite bronze sculptures. Temples dedicated to Siva and Vishnu received liberal donations of money, jewels, animals, and land, and thereby became powerful economic institutions.|$|E

Originally a strong supporter of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, he later became a leader of the anti-Thaksin movement. Under his leadership, the PAD was the major player in the 2005–2006 Thai political crisis that led to the 2006 military coup that toppled the Thaksin government. When Thaksin-affiliated parties won the 2007 general election, Sondhi became the major player in the 2008–2009 Thai political crisis, leading the PAD in violent clashes with security forces and anti-PAD protestors as well as the seizure of Government House, Don Muang Airport, and Suvarnabhumi Airport.
