5|$|Since {{bupropion}} is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the CYP2B6 enzyme, {{drug interactions}} with CYP2B6 inhibitors are possible: this includes medications like paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, diazepam, clopidogrel, and <b>orphenadrine.</b> The expected {{result is the}} increase of bupropion and decrease of hydroxybupropion blood concentration. The reverse effect (decrease of bupropion and increase of hydroxybupropion) can be expected with CYP2B6 inducers, such as carbamazepine, clotrimazole, rifampicin, ritonavir, St John's wort, phenobarbital, phenytoin and others. Conversely, because bupropion is itself a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (Ki = 21μM), as is its active metabolite, hydroxybupropion (Ki = 13.3μM), it can slow the clearance of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. As an example, the ratio of dextromethorphan (a drug that is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6) to its major metabolite dextrorphan increased approximately 35-fold when it was administered to people being treated with 300mg/day bupropion, indicative of a major drug interaction with a common over-the-counter medicine.|$|E
25|$|Miscellaneous others including: cocaine, methyldopa, fenfluramine, disulfiram, <b>orphenadrine,</b> pentoxifylline, sodium aurothiomalate, etc.|$|E
25|$|Other common {{spasmolytic}} agents include: methocarbamol, carisoprodol, chlorzoxazone, cyclobenzaprine, gabapentin, metaxalone, and <b>orphenadrine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Adjuvant analgesics, {{also called}} {{atypical}} analgesics, include nefopam, <b>orphenadrine,</b> pregabalin, gabapentin, cyclobenzaprine, hyoscine (scopolamine), {{and other drugs}} possessing anticonvulsant, anticholinergic, and/or antispasmodic properties, {{as well as many}} other drugs with CNS actions. These drugs are used along with analgesics to modulate and/or modify the action of opioids when used against pain, especially of neuropathic origin.|$|E
25|$|Itching tends {{not to be}} {{a severe}} problem when opioids are used for pain relief, but antihistamines are useful for counteracting itching when it occurs. Non-sedating antihistamines such as {{fexofenadine}} are often preferred as they avoid increasing opioid induced drowsiness. However, some sedating antihistamines such as <b>orphenadrine</b> can produce a synergistic pain relieving effect permitting smaller doses of opioids be used. Consequently, several opioid/antihistamine combination products have been marketed, such as Meprozine (meperidine/promethazine) and Diconal (dipipanone/cyclizine), and these may also reduce opioid induced nausea.|$|E
25|$|It {{is also a}} {{moderate}} inhibitor of CYP2D6 and also a substrate for CYP2D6 and hence can inhibit its own metabolism. It can also inhibit the clearance of CYP2D6 substrates such as dextromethorphan and hence also potentiate their effects. Other drugs like codeine and tamoxifen which require CYP2D6-mediated activation into their respective active metabolites may have their therapeutic effects attenuated. Likewise CYP2D6 inhibitors such as paroxetine or fluoxetine can reduce chlorpromazine clearance and hence increase serum levels of chlorpromazine and hence potentially also its adverse effects. Chlorpromazine also reduces phenytoin levels and increases valproic acid levels. It also reduces propranolol clearance and antagonises the therapeutic effects of antidiabetic agents, levodopa (a Parkinson's medication. This is likely {{due to the fact}} that chlorpromazine antagonises the D2 receptor which is one of the receptors dopamine, a levodopa metabolite, activates), amfetamines and anticoagulants. It may also interact with anticholinergic drugs such as <b>orphenadrine</b> to produce hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar).|$|E
25|$|Tolerance to nausea occurs within 7–10 days, {{during which}} antiemetics (e.g. low dose {{haloperidol}} once at night) are very effective. Due to severe side effects such as tardive dyskinesia, haloperidol is now rarely used. A related drug, prochlorperazine {{is more often}} used, although it has similar risks. Stronger antiemetics such as ondansetron or tropisetron are sometimes used when nausea is severe or continuous and disturbing, despite their greater cost. A less expensive alternative is dopamine antagonists such as domperidone and metoclopramide. Domperidone does not cross the blood–brain barrier and produce adverse central antidopaminergic effects, but blocks opioid emetic action in the chemoreceptor trigger zone. (The drug is not available in the U.S.) Some antihistamines with anticholinergic properties (e.g. <b>orphenadrine</b> or diphenhydramine) may also be effective. The first-generation antihistamine hydroxyzine is very commonly used, with the added advantages of not causing movement disorders, and also possessing analgesic-sparing properties. Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol relieves nausea and vomiting; it also produces analgesia that may allow lower doses of opioids with reduced nausea and vomiting.|$|E

2500|$|The use of {{adjuvant}} analgesics is {{an important}} and growing part of the pain-control field and new discoveries are made practically every year. [...] Many of these drugs combat the side-effects of opioid analgesics, an added bonus. [...] For example, antihistamines including <b>orphenadrine</b> combat the release of histamine caused by many opioids. Stimulants such as methylphenidate, caffeine, ephedrine, dextroamphetamine, methamphetamine, and cocaine work against heavy sedation and may elevate mood in distressed patients as do the antidepressants. The use of medicinal cannabis remains a debated issue.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{skeletal}} muscle relaxants {{of that type}} used around the world come {{from a number of}} drug categories and other drugs used primarily for this indication include <b>orphenadrine</b> (anticholinergic), chlorzoxazone, tizanidine (clonidine relative), diazepam, tetrazepam and other benzodiazepines, mephenoxalone, methocarbamol, dantrolene, baclofen, [...] Drugs once but no longer or very rarely used to relax {{skeletal muscle}}s include meprobamate, barbiturates, methaqualone, glutethimide and the like; some subcategories of opioids have muscle relaxant properties, and some are marketed in combination drugs with skeletal and/or smooth muscle relaxants such as whole opium products, some ketobemidone, piritramide and fentanyl preparations and Equagesic.|$|E
2500|$|Amongst analgesics {{there are}} {{a small number of}} agents which act on the central nervous system but not on the opioid {{receptor}} system and therefore have none of the other (narcotic) qualities of opioids although they may produce euphoria by relieving pain—a euphoria that, because of the way it is produced, does not form the basis of habituation, physical dependence, or addiction. [...] Foremost amongst these are nefopam, <b>orphenadrine,</b> and perhaps phenyltoloxamine or some other antihistamines. [...] Tricyclic antidepressants have painkilling effect as well, but they're thought to do so by indirectly activating the endogenous opioid system. Paracetamol is predominantly a centrally acting analgesic (non-narcotic) which mediates its effect by action on descending serotoninergic (5-hydroxy triptaminergic) pathways, to increase 5-HT release (which inhibits release of pain mediators). It also decreases cyclo-oxygenase activity. It has recently been discovered that most or all of the therapeutic efficacy of paracetamol is due to a metabolite, AM404, which enhances the release of serotonin and inhibits the uptake of anandamide.|$|E

50|$|A 2003 Cochrane Review {{of the use}} of {{anticholinergic}} {{drugs to}} improve motor function in Parkinson's disease found that as a class, the drugs are useful for that purpose; it identified one single-site randomised, cross-over study of <b>orphenadrine</b> vs placebo. <b>Orphenadrine</b> and other anticholinergics have largely been superseded by other drugs; they have a use in alleviating motor function symptoms, and appear to help about 20% of people with Parkinson's.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the {{development}} of amantadine in the late 1960s and then other drugs, anticholinergics like <b>orphenadrine</b> were the mainstay of Parkinson's treatment.|$|E

50|$|Tofenacin (INN; Elamol, Tofacine, Tofalin), or {{tofenacin}} hydrochloride (USAN), {{also sometimes}} called mono-N-desmethylorphenadrine, is an antidepressant drug with a tricyclic-like structure which {{was developed and}} marketed in the United Kingdom and Italy in 1971 and 1981, respectively, by Brocades-Stheeman & Pharmacia (now part of Astellas Pharma). It acts as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and based on its close relation to <b>orphenadrine,</b> may also possess anticholinergic and antihistamine properties. In addition to its use as a pharmaceutical medication, tofenacin is the major active metabolite of <b>orphenadrine</b> and likely {{plays a role in}} its beneficial effects against depressive symptoms seen in Parkinsons disease patients.|$|E
50|$|<b>Orphenadrine</b> {{has been}} {{available}} as a citrate salt and a hydrochloride salt; in the US as of February 2016 the citrate form was available in tablets, extended release tablets, and by injection for acute use in a hospital setting.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{drugs are}} often used to help analgesics combat various types of pain, {{and parts of the}} overall pain experience, and are hence called {{adjuvant}} medications. Gabapentin - an anti-epileptic - not only exerts effects alone on neuropathic pain, but can potentiate opiates. [...] While perhaps not prescribed as such, other drugs such as Tagamet (cimetidine) and even simple grapefruit juice may also potentiate opiates, by inhibiting CYP450 enzymes in the liver, thereby slowing metabolism of the drug. In addition, <b>orphenadrine,</b> cyclobenzaprine, trazodone and other drugs with anticholinergic properties are useful in conjunction with opioids for neuropathic pain. <b>Orphenadrine</b> and cyclobenzaprine are also muscle relaxants, and therefore particularly useful in painful musculoskeletal conditions. Clonidine has found use as an analgesic for this same purpose, and all of the mentioned drugs potentiate the effects of opioids overall.|$|E
50|$|Adjuvant analgesics, {{also called}} {{atypical}} analgesics, include nefopam, <b>orphenadrine,</b> pregabalin, gabapentin, cyclobenzaprine, scopolamine, {{and other drugs}} possessing anticonvulsant, anticholinergic, and/or antispasmodic properties, {{as well as many}} other drugs with CNS actions. These drugs are used along with analgesics to modulate and/or modify the action of opioids when used against pain, especially of neuropathic origin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Orphenadrine</b> (sold under many {{brand names}} worldwide) is an {{anticholinergic}} drug of the ethanolamine antihistamine class; it {{is closely related}} to diphenhydramine. It is used to treat muscle pain and to help with motor control in Parkinson's disease, but has largely been superseded by newer drugs. It was discovered and developed in the 1940s.|$|E
50|$|Anticholinergic drugs include benzhexol and <b>orphenadrine.</b> These drugs {{reduce the}} effect of {{acetylcholine}} in the brain by antagonizing cholinergic receptors. This helps restore the acetylcholine/dopamine balance within the brain. Again with these treatments, about 70% of patients taking anticholinergics develop serious side effects, including hallucinations, dyskinetic movements, vision effects, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth and urine retention.|$|E
50|$|Pharmacotherapy may be {{used for}} acute {{musculoskeletal}} conditions when physical therapy is unavailable or has not been fully successful. Another class of antispasmodics for such treatment includes cyclobenzaprine, carisoprodol, diazepam, <b>orphenadrine,</b> and tizanidine. Effectiveness has not been clearly shown for metaxalone, methocarbamol, chlorzoxazone, baclofen, or dantrolene. Applicable conditions include acute back or neck pain, or pain after an injury.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Orphenadrine</b> has {{the side}} effects of the other common antihistamines in large part. Stimulation is {{somewhat}} more common than with other related antihistamines, and is especially common in the elderly. Common side effects include dry mouth, dizziness, drowsiness, upset stomach or vomiting, constipation, urine retention, blurred vision, and headache. [...] Its use in Parkinson's is especially limited by these factors.|$|E
50|$|George Rieveschl was a {{professor}} of chemistry at the University of Cincinnati and led a research program working on antihistamines. In 1943, one of his students, Fred Huber, synthesized diphenhydramine. Rieveschl worked with Parke-Davis to test the compound, and the company licensed the patent from him. In 1947 Parke-Davis hired him as their Director of Research. While he was there, he led the development of <b>orphenadrine,</b> an analog of diphenhydramine.|$|E
50|$|Ketoprofen {{can also}} be used for {{treatment}} of some pain, especially nerve pain such as sciatica, postherpetic neuralgia and referred pain for radiculopathy, {{in the form of a}} cream, ointment, liquid, spray, or gel, which may also contain ketamine and lidocaine, along with other agents which may be useful, such as cyclobenzaprine, amitriptyline, acyclovir, gabapentin, <b>orphenadrine</b> and other drugs used as NSAIDs or adjuvant, atypical or potentiators for pain treatment.|$|E
50|$|Phenyltoloxamine has {{analgesic}} and anti-spasmodic {{properties of}} its own and is used in combination with paracetamol, aspirin and other salicylates and other drugs in proprietary preparations available over the counter for backache, muscle strains and similar conditions. In this respect, it {{is similar to a}} closely related antihistamine, <b>orphenadrine,</b> and both drugs are very closely related to diphenhydramine and to doxylamine, the latter of which is the active ingredient in NyQuil and many other cough preparations.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} of action of nefopam is not well understood, although inhibition of serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake {{is thought to be}} involved in its analgesic effects, and there may be other modes of action such as through histamine H3 receptors and glutamate. Recently, like its analogue <b>orphenadrine</b> which also has analgesic effects, nefopam has been found to act as a voltage-gated sodium channel blocker, and this may in part or fully mediate its antinociceptive effects.|$|E
