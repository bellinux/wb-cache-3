One may say that one allele, all <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>being</b> equal or varying within certain limits, causes greater legs than its alternative. This difference enables the scrutiny of natural selection.|$|E
25|$|Public-key {{algorithms}} {{are based}} on the computational difficulty of various problems. The most famous of these is integer factorization (e.g., the RSA algorithm is based on a problem related to integer factoring), but the discrete logarithm problem is also important. Much public-key cryptanalysis concerns numerical algorithms for solving these computational problems, or some of them, efficiently (i.e., in a practical time). For instance, the best known algorithms for solving the elliptic curve-based version of discrete logarithm are much more time-consuming than the best known algorithms for factoring, at least for problems of more or less equivalent size. Thus, <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>being</b> equal, to achieve an equivalent strength of attack resistance, factoring-based encryption techniques must use larger keys than elliptic curve techniques. For this reason, public-key cryptosystems based on elliptic curves have become popular since their invention in the mid-1990s.|$|E

In general, until the synthesis of dihydromorphine (ca. 1900), the dihydromorphinone class of opioids (1920s), and oxycodone (1916) and similar drugs, {{there were no other}} drugs in the same efficacy range as opium, morphine, and heroin, with synthetics still several years away (pethidine was invented in Germany in 1937) and opioid agonists among the semi-synthetics were analogues and derivatives of codeine such as dihydrocodeine (Paracodin), ethylmorphine (Dionine), and benzylmorphine (Peronine). Even today, morphine is the most sought after prescription narcotic by heroin addicts when heroin is scarce, all <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>being</b> equal; local conditions and user preference may cause hydromorphone, oxymorphone, high-dose oxycodone, or methadone as well as dextromoramide in specific instances such as 1970s Australia, to top that particular list.

Using a sample of 233 Australian credit unions the study uses nonparametric techniques to measure efficiency, followed by parametric techniques to attribute variation in efficiency.

40|$|The divorce between {{profitability}} {{and growth}} that emerged since the 80 s raises a paradox {{that has to}} be explained. The macroeconomic realisation of profits being determined by capitalists’ spendings, the slowdown of accumulation cannot come (theoretically) with a profitability recovery, <b>others</b> <b>things</b> <b>being</b> equal. After having recalled, in a first chapter, that financialisation is only the last avatar of a long trend for capitalism to escape from real economy, we show, in a second chapter, that financialisation leads, for the individual firm, to a reorientation towards shareholders’ profitability claims at the expense of managers and capital accumulation, financial (indebtedness) and real (capacity utilisation) security, and also of workers (real wage). After having faced, in a third chapter, two methodological, embarrassing questions for kaleckian models of growth and distribution (not very plausible and unstable for the most plausible ones), we use, in a fourth chapter, a second macroeconomic approach (stock-flow consistent model) where conflict impacts distribution (conflict inflation) and accumulation (growth/profit trade-off). We show that dividends distribution and share buybacks allow, within the limits permitted by indebtedness, for a stimulation of rentiers’ consumption and for the realisation of profitability claims, in spite of the slowdown of accumulation...|$|R
