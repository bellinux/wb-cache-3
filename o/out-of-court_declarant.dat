40|$|Hearsay is an {{out-of-court}} declaration {{offered to}} prove {{the truth of the}} matter asserted. It is inadmissible because it is uncrossexamined and hence too unreliable for the jury to consider. Where some substitute for cross-examination provides an alternative assurance of reliability, the rule against hearsay may give way and the out-of-court declaration be admitted under one or another of the exceptions to the rule. But hearsay it remains. The evidence is received despite the lack of cross-examination. Concerning confrontation, the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States says that 2 ̆ 2 [i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right [...] . to be confronted with the witnesses against him. 2 ̆ 2 Since an <b>out-of-court</b> <b>declarant</b> cannot be confronted, is hearsay ever admissible against the defendant in a criminal case? What, in short, is the relationship between confrontation and hearsay? Several times over the past seven years, the Supreme Court has taken up this question. Its opinions demonstrate that the Court has yet to find a satisfactory answe...|$|E
40|$|This {{speech was}} {{delivered}} to the Wicomico Co. Bar Association on October 28 th, 2016. It is {{an updated version of}} the 2012 speech, available at [URL]. Overview: Only an out-of-court statement (2 ̆ 2 OCS 2 ̆ 2) offered for {{the truth of the matter}} that was being asserted by the <b>out-of-court</b> <b>declarant</b> (2 ̆ 2 declarant 2 ̆ 2) at the time when s/he made the OCS (2 ̆ 2 TOMA 2 ̆ 2) = hearsay (2 ̆ 2 HS 2 ̆ 2). If evidence is not HS, the HS rule cannot exclude it. The Confrontation Clause also applies only to HS, but even then, only to its subcategory comprising 2 ̆ 2 testimonial hearsay. 2 ̆ 2 Cross-references to 2 ̆ 2 MD-EV 2 ̆ 2 are to section numbers of L. MCLAIN, vols. 5, 6, and 6 A of the Maryland Practice Series, MARYLAND EVIDENCE: STATE AND FEDERAL (Thomson Reuters 3 d ed. 2013 and 2015 - 2016 pocket parts, which were compiled by Leonard Stamm, Esq.), which is available hardbound or on Westlaw. The books are most easily found on Westlaw by searching for 2 ̆ 2 McLain 2 ̆ 2 under 2 ̆ 2 Secondary Sources 2 ̆ 2 in the Maryland database. They contain much more detail than does vol. 7, which is softbound and provides a short overview of the Maryland Rules of Evidence. An earlier version of the charts in this handout is found in section 800 : 0 of the treatise. That version may be accessed on Westlaw by clicking on the PDF icon for each particular chart...|$|E
40|$|Current Confrontation Clause {{doctrine}} is confused-in its reasoning {{more than in}} its results-and Professor Friedman 2 ̆ 7 s proposed alternative would eliminate much of the confusion. 2 ̆ 7 Professor Friedman 2 ̆ 7 s key substantive insight is that the word 2 ̆ 2 witnesses 2 ̆ 2 in the Clause should be construed more narrowly, but that when the Clause does indeed apply, it lays down a bright-line rule, not a mushy balancing test. Professor Friedman 2 ̆ 7 s key methodological insight is that the Confrontation Clause is 2 ̆ 2 very distinct 2 ̆ 2 from ordinary hearsay doctrine. To interpret the Clause properly, we need to look, first and foremost, to constitutional law, not evidence law. All this is, I think, exactly right. But in crafting his proposed alternative, Professor Friedman fails to carry his substantive and methodological insights to their logical conclusions. He argues that 2 ̆ 2 witnesses 2 ̆ 2 under the Confrontation Clause should not encompass all <b>out-of-court</b> <b>declarants,</b> but should include all those who make accusatory statements {{with the understanding that}} those statements will later be presented to a factfinder at trial. Substantively, his definition of 2 ̆ 2 witnesses, 2 ̆ 2 though cleaner and narrower than that adopted by the Supreme Court, is still a tad too broad. Methodologically, his definition unwittingly reflects residual traces of hearsay doctrine and tends to slight constitutional text, history, and structure. Professor Friedman 2 ̆ 7 s proposal is vastly more coherent than current doctrine, but I think we can do better still...|$|R
40|$|The Supreme Court’s {{decision}} in Ohio v. Clark, provides an occasion {{to take stock}} of the Sixth Amendment Right to Confrontation since the court’s landmark 2004 {{decision in}} Crawford v. Washington. Crawford strengthened a defendant’s right to confront his accusers face-to-face, underscoring that cross-examination is the constitutionally preferred method for testing the reliability of accusatory statements. Clark could eliminate that right {{in a wide range of}} cases where, although the reliability of a <b>declarant’s</b> <b>out-of-court</b> statements is critically important, a defendant has no right to confrontation...|$|R
5000|$|Probably {{the most}} famous of Justice Gray's {{opinions}} is Mut. Life Ins. Co. of N.Y. v. Hillmon (1892), which held that a <b>declarant's</b> <b>out-of-court</b> statement of his intention to do something or go somewhere in the future is admissible under the [...] "state-of-mind" [...] hearsay exception. [...] "The letters in question were competent, not as narratives of facts communicated to Walters by others, nor yet as proof that he actually went away from Wichita, but as evidence that, shortly before the time when other evidence tended to show that he went away, he had the intention of going, and of going with Hillmon, which made it more probable both that he did go and that he went with Hillmon, than if there had been no proof of such intention." [...] This holding gained wide acceptance and is now codfied in Rule 803(3) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, as well as the evidence law in most states.|$|R
