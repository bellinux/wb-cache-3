5|$|An {{economic}} downturn was beginning in Canada by 1958. Because <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> instituted the previous year, the budget {{presented by the}} government predicted a small deficit for 1957–58, and a large one, $648million, for the following year. Minister of Finance Fleming and Bank of Canada Governor James Coyne proposed that the wartime Victory Bond issue, which constituted two-thirds of the national debt and which was due to be redeemed by 1967, be refinanced to a longer term. After considerable indecision on Diefenbaker's part, a nationwide campaign took place, and 90% of the bonds were converted. However, this transaction led {{to an increase in}} the money supply, which in future years would hamper the government's efforts to respond to unemployment.|$|E

This combination of opening up of the economy, fiscal and monetary stabilisation created an entrepreneurial climate in Iceland that spurred record {{economic growth in the}} country, with the real average income of individual households increasing by more than 17%, but was also a factor that resulted in the 2008–2012 Icelandic financial crisis.|$|E

Measured for fiscal years 2001-2008, Federal spending under President Bush averaged 19.0% of GDP, just below his predecessor President Bill Clinton at 19.2% GDP, although tax receipts were substantially lower at 17.1% GDP versus 18.4% GDP. Income tax revenues averaged 7.7% GDP under Bush, versus 8.5% GDP under Clinton. The sizable {{national debt}} increases during his Administration represented a reversal from a sizable surplus projection by the Congressional Budget Office just prior to his taking office.|$|E

25|$|Melissa Bean, of Barrington was the {{incumbent}} {{representative of the}} 8th district, having displaced Phil Crane in the 2004 election. Bean {{is considered to be}} one of the more conservative Democrats currently serving in the House, having voted the Democratic Party line only 79.5% during the first 18 months of her term. Only 26 Democratic Representatives, out of 201 serving during her first term, had more conservative voting records. Bean identifies as a Blue Dog Democrat, meaning she tends to be slightly more socially conservative, and much more fiscally conservative, than other Democrats in the House. Indeed, Bean was one of the few Democratic supporters of the Central American Free Trade Agreement, a move which cost her the endorsement of the AFL-CIO. She also voted to extend a package <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> passed by the Republican-controlled congress, a dramatic break from the Democratic Party's official position on the cuts. However, her fiscally conservative voting record earned Bean the endorsement of the United States Chamber of Commerce. The organization, composed mainly of small businesses, rarely endorses Democrats, feeling that the positions advocated by the Party are harmful to businesses.|$|E

In early 1998, he was a serious contender for the 2000 United States presidential election, but his campaign possibilities faltered, and he instead endorsed eventual winner George W. Bush. [...] Kemp continued his political advocacy for reform of taxation, Social Security and education. When a 1997 budget surplus was earmarked for debt repayment, Kemp opposed the plan in favor <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts.</b> Along with John Ashcroft and Alan Krueger, he endorsed reform of payroll taxes to eliminate double taxation. In addition to his fiscal and economic policies, Kemp advocated against abortion when Congress was considering a bill banning intact dilation and extractions. He also advocated for retired NFL veterans {{on issues such as}} cardiovascular screening, assisted living, disability benefits, and the 2007 joint replacement program. He argued in support of reforming immigration laws. In the late 1990s, Kemp also was a vocal advocate for free market reform in Africa, arguing that the continent had great economic growth potential if it could shed autocratic and statist governmental policies.|$|E

Second, we document that the degree of income uncertainty facing the typical individual orfamily is large. Third, we show that, for plausible utility function parameters and distributions of future income, the MPC out <b>of</b> a <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> is quantitatively large. Indeed, the MPC out <b>of</b> a <b>tax</b> <b>cut,</b> coupled with a future income tax increase, can be closer to the Keynesian value that ignores the future tax liabilities than to the Ricardian value that treats future taxes as if they were lump-sum. ...|$|R

He ended the oil windfall profits tax in 1988. In 1982, Reagan agreed to a rollback <b>of</b> corporate <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> and a smaller rollback <b>of</b> individual income <b>tax</b> <b>cuts.</b> The 1982, <b>tax</b> increase undid a third <b>of</b> the initial <b>tax</b> <b>cut.</b> In 1983, Reagan instituted a payroll tax increase on Social Security and Medicare hospital insurance.

500|$|As governor, Johnson {{followed}} a strict small-government approach. According to former New Mexico Republican National Committee member Mickey D. Barnett, [...] "Any time someone approached him about legislation for some purpose, his first response always {{was to ask}} if government {{should be involved in}} that to begin with." [...] He vetoed 200 of 424 bills passed in his first six months in office—a national record of 47% of all legislation—and used the line-item veto on most remaining bills. [...] In office, Johnson fulfilled his campaign promise to reduce the 10% annual growth of the state budget. [...] In his first budget, Johnson proposed a wide range <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts,</b> including a repeal of the prescription drug tax, a $47 million income tax cut, and a 6-cents-per-gallon gasoline tax cut. However, of these, only the gasoline tax cut was passed. During the November 1995 federal government shutdown, he joined 20 other Republican governors who called on the Republican leadership in Congress to stand firm against the Clinton administration in budget negotiations; in the article reporting on the letter and concomitant news conference he was quoted as calling for eliminating the budget deficit through proportional cuts across the budget. Although Johnson worked to reduce overall state spending, in his first term he raised education spending by nearly a third. [...] When drop-out rates and test scores showed little improvement, Johnson changed his tactics and began advocating school vouchers—a key issue in budget battles of his second term as governor.|$|E

Collectively called [...] "Reaganomics", these economic policies were established through several pieces of legislation passed between 1980 and 1987.|$|E
