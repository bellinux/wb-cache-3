5|$|After McKinley's inauguration, {{increases}} in gold availability from new discoveries and improved refining methods {{led to a}} considerable increase in the money supply. Even so, in 1900, Congress passed the Gold Standard Act, formally placing the United States on that standard. Although Bryan ran again <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>silver</b> platform in the 1900 presidential election, the issue failed to produce the same resonance with the voters. McKinley won more easily than in 1896, making inroads in the silver West.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland's agrarian and silverite enemies {{gained control}} of the Democratic party in 1896, repudiated his {{administration}} and the gold standard, and nominated William Jennings Bryan <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Silver</b> Platform. Cleveland silently supported the Gold Democrats' third-party ticket that promised to defend the gold standard, limit government and oppose high tariffs, but he declined their nomination for a third term. The party won only 100,000 votes in the general election, and William McKinley, the Republican nominee, triumphed easily over Bryan. Agrarians nominated Bryan again in 1900. In 1904 the conservatives, with Cleveland's support, re{{gained control of}} the Democratic Party and nominated Alton B. Parker.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, a large {{quantity}} of unissued Morgan dollars {{was discovered in}} the Treasury vaults, including issues once thought rare. Individuals began purchasing large quantities of the pieces at face value, and eventually the Treasury ceased exchanging silver certificates for silver coin. Beginning in the 1970s, the Treasury conducted a sale of silver dollars minted at the Carson City Mint through the General Services Administration. In 2006, Morgan's reverse design was used <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>silver</b> dollar issued to commemorate the old San Francisco Mint building.|$|E

Released after a five-year absence, it garnered wide acclaim from critics. Anderson's sixth film, the drama The Master (2012), was released to critical acclaim.

5|$|In 1902, {{during the}} {{presidency}} of Julio Argentino Roca, Belgrano's body was exhumed from the atrium of Santo Domingo, to be moved into a mausoleum. This was done on 4 September, by a government commission which included Dr. Joaquín V. González (ministry of interior), Pablo Riccheri (ministry of war), Gabriel L. Souto (president of the commission), Fray Modesto Becco (from the convent), Carlos Vega Belgrano and coronel Manuel Belgrano (descendants of Belgrano), Dr. Armando Claros (subsecretary of the Interior), Dr. Marcial Quiroga (Health Inspector of the Army), Dr. Carlos Malbrán (president of the National Department of Health), Coronel Justo Domínguez, and doctors Luis Peluffo and C. Massot (Arsenal of War). The exhumation revealed a number of preserved bones, pieces of wood, and nails. The bones were placed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>silver</b> plate, and the following day {{there was a great}} controversy in the press: the newspaper La Prensa announced that Joaquín V. González and Riccheri had stolen a pair of teeth. Both were returned the following day. Gonzalez declared that he intended to show the tooth to his friends, and Riccheri that he took one to Belgrano's biographer, Bartolomé Mitre.|$|E
5|$|Wodehouse's {{early period}} {{as a writer}} {{came to an end}} in 1908 with the {{serialisation}} of The Lost Lambs, published the following year in book form as {{the second half of the}} novel Mike. The work begins as a conventional school story, but Wodehouse introduces a new and strikingly original character, Psmith, whose creation both Evelyn Waugh and George Orwell regarded as a watershed in Wodehouse's development. Wodehouse said that he based Psmith on the hotelier and impresario Rupert D'Oyly Carte—"the only thing in my literary career which was handed to me <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>silver</b> plate with watercress around it". Wodehouse wrote in the 1970s that a cousin of his who had been at school with Carte told him of the latter's monocle, studied suavity, and stateliness of speech, all of which Wodehouse adopted for his new character. Psmith featured in three more novels: Psmith in the City (1910), a burlesque of banking; Psmith, Journalist (1915) set in New York; and Leave It to Psmith (1923), set at Blandings Castle.|$|E

In these cases, the detached subunits carried only the vexillum, and not the aquila, and were called, therefore, vexillationes. A miniature vexillum, mounted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>silver</b> base, was sometimes awarded to officers as a recognition of their service upon retirement or reassignment.|$|E
25|$|Georgette Heyer, {{author of}} a number of Regency romance novels, {{included}} Brummell as a character in her 1935 novel Regency Buck.
