40|$|The {{dissertation}} ‘An Analysis <b>of</b> Legislative <b>Assistance</b> in the EP’ {{treats the}} problem of unelected parliamentary officials, which assist the elected members in the EP. The main research question is how does the organisational form <b>of</b> legislative <b>assistance</b> affect {{the functioning of the}} EP. The dissertation contributes to a new area of research in legislative studies on the relationship between technocracy and democracy. To gain an insight into the research question, the dissertation is concerned with the institutional design <b>of</b> legislative <b>assistance</b> in two different ways. First, the research project explains the form <b>of</b> legislative <b>assistance</b> in the EP between 1952 and 2013. Second, the dissertation investigates the behavioural consequences (i. e. staff’s frequency <b>of</b> involvement in <b>assistance)</b> <b>of</b> the administrative form in the seventh term (2009 - 2014). Following these aims, the dissertation is divided into two empirical parts. The qualitative part explains the form <b>of</b> legislative <b>assistance</b> in the EP based on new-institutionalists approaches to organisational design and qualitative methods (content analysis of interview and secondary data). The quantitative part investigates how the form <b>of</b> legislative <b>assistance</b> affects the behaviour of staff based on organisation theory and quantitative methods (PCA/regression). A comparison with the national legislatures reveals that in most aspects the organisation <b>of</b> legislative <b>assistance</b> in the EP resembles the one in state-parliaments, while other aspects are exclusive to the EP. State-parliament characteristics were adopted already in the 1950 s due to functional-ideational considerations. Changes were more dynamic in the 1960 s/ 1970 s compared to the 1980 s/ 1990 s. Until the 1980 s, the administrative structures of the EP were responding to political events. Organisational structures significantly determine the frequency staff assist MEPs. To sum up, while the behaviour of staff is conditioned by the organisation <b>of</b> legislative <b>assistance,</b> the organisation itself is conditioned by the historical institutional environment and functional considerations of the EP...|$|R

This article utilizes Swedish annual data on aggregated unemployment and means-tested social assistance recipiency in the period 1946 – 1990 and proposes a multiple time-series approach based on vector error-correction modelling to establish the direction of influence. First, we show that rates of unemployment and receipt <b>of</b> social <b>assistance</b> is co-integrated. Second, we demonstrate that adjustments to the long-run equilibrium are made through adjustments of the unemployment. This indicates that the level of unemployment reacts to changes in rates <b>of</b> social <b>assistance</b> recipiency rather than vice versa. It is also shown that lagged changes in the level of unemployment do not predict changes in rates <b>of</b> social <b>assistance</b> recipients in short-term. Together these findings demonstrate that the number <b>of</b> social <b>assistance</b> recipients does increase the number of unemployed in a period characterized by low unemployment and high employment.
