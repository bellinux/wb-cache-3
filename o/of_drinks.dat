5|$|Storm played {{football}} regularly {{and was a}} good skater and swimmer (once swimming the 12.5-mile length of Windermere). Liverpool F.C. used to train at Melwood {{and he went to}} watch them in training, later putting up a large photo of himself training with the team on his wall at home. He was the captain of Mersey Beat magazine's football team, called the Mersey Beat XI. Storm was born with a stutter (a speech impediment), which did not affect his singing. Because of Storm's bad stammer, his friends never allowed him to tell a joke or to order a round <b>of</b> <b>drinks,</b> as it took too long. He became a cotton salesman (as was Jim McCartney, Paul McCartney's father) before forming a skiffle group.|$|E
5|$|Wine was {{considered}} the basic drink, consumed at all meals and occasions by all classes and was quite inexpensive. Cato the Elder once advised cutting his rations in half to conserve wine for the workforce. Many types <b>of</b> <b>drinks</b> involving grapes and honey were consumed as well. Drinking {{on an empty stomach}} was regarded as boorish and a sure sign for alcoholism, the debilitating physical and psychological effects of which were known to the Romans. An accurate accusation of being an alcoholic was an effective way to discredit political rivals. Prominent Roman alcoholics included Marcus Antonius, and Cicero's own son Marcus (Cicero Minor). Even Cato the Younger was known to be a heavy drinker.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} Peggy's {{day and a}} heated {{argument}} with her boyfriend Abe, over her preoccupation with work and the effect this has on their sex life. The argument ends with Abe's leaving in a huff. After Don pulls Megan away for an impromptu trip to a Howard Johnson's hotel in upstate New York, Peggy has to pitch to the Heinz executives without them and unsuccessfully tries to sell the Heinz executives on her concept. Frustrated, she leaves work, has a couple <b>of</b> <b>drinks,</b> and goes to see the film Born Free (1966). She sees a young man smoking marijuana behind her, partakes herself, and eventually gives him a hand job. She returns to her office to see Ginsberg arguing with his father. After being told off by Ginsberg for eavesdropping, she falls asleep in Don's office. She awakens to a call from Don, who seems alarmed for incomprehensible reasons. Don hangs up on her, and Peggy returns to her office. When Peggy asks about Ginsberg's life, Ginsberg initially {{claims to be a}} Martian, stating that Morris Ginsberg is not his father. Michael was born in a Nazi concentration camp and, after its liberation, Morris claimed him from a Swedish orphanage when Michael was 5 years old. Peggy returns home, affected by this story, and calls Abe. She tells him about Ginsberg and asks him to come over to be with her.|$|E
40|$|The major {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to characterise drink drivers in Queensland and generate profiles <b>of</b> <b>drink</b> drivers within the general driving population, convicted drink drivers, recidivist drink drivers, and crash-involved drink drivers. This profile was part of Phase 1 of the work program of the Impaired Driving Legislation Review Research Sub-Group convened by Queensland Transport, and was conducted to provide background information that could inform other components of the review. Variables of interest included: gender; age; Indigenous status; licence status; frequency <b>of</b> <b>drink</b> driving; BAC at time <b>of</b> <b>drink</b> driving offence; previous convictions; location <b>of</b> <b>drink</b> driving offence; socio-economic status (income and education); employment; purpose of trip; passengers; and vehicle type. While profiles <b>of</b> the <b>drink</b> driving offender were generated {{for each of the four}} "sub-groups" <b>of</b> <b>drink</b> drivers, this paper will present the general profile <b>of</b> the <b>drink</b> driver in Queensland...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} {{study was to examine the}} {{associations}} between a number of individual factors (demographic factors (age and gender), personality factors, risk-taking propensity, attitudes towards drink driving, and perceived legitimacy <b>of</b> <b>drink</b> driving enforcement) and how they influence the self-reported likelihood <b>of</b> <b>drink</b> driving. The second aim of this study was to examine the potential of attitudes mediating the relationship between risk-taking and self-reported likelihood <b>of</b> <b>drink</b> driving. In total, 293 Queensland drivers volunteered to participate in an online survey that assessed their self-reported likelihood to drink drive in the next month, demographics, traffic-related demographics, personality factors, risk-taking propensity, attitudes towards drink driving, and perceived legitimacy <b>of</b> <b>drink</b> driving enforcement. An ordered logistic regression analysis was utilised to evaluate the first {{aim of the}} study; at the first step the demographic variables were entered; at step two the personality and risk-taking were entered; at the third step, the attitudes and perceptions of legitimacy variables were entered. Being a younger driver and having a high risk-taking propensity were related to self-reported likelihood <b>of</b> <b>drink</b> driving. However, when the attitudes variable was entered, these individual factors were no longer significant; with attitudes being the most important predictor <b>of</b> self-reported <b>drink</b> driving likelihood. A significant mediation model was found with the second aim of the study, such that attitudes mediated the relationship between risk-taking and self-reported likelihood <b>of</b> <b>drink</b> driving. Considerable effort and resources are utilised by traffic authorities to reducing drink driving on the Australian road network. Notwithstanding these efforts, some participants still had some positive attitudes towards drink driving and reported that they were likely to drink drive in the future. These findings suggest that more work is needed to address attitudes regarding the dangerousness <b>of</b> <b>drink</b> driving...|$|R
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{arrive in}} Comity after arguing over {{directions}} along the way. They meet a local detective, Angela White (Dana Wheeler-Nicholson), {{and go to}} Boom's funeral. Scully, in a bad mood, is skeptical of these claims. The high school principal, Bob Spitz, interrupts the funeral by ranting Inquisitorial-style about Satanic cults murdering their children when suddenly the coffin starts smoking and catches on fire. Mulder and Scully go into separate rooms to interview Margi and Terri, both of whom offer an identical story about a satanic ceremony where a baby was sacrificed. Scully thinks their stories are cliché and points {{out the fact that}} the belief in a satanic conspiracy is illogical and paranoid. Looking at the latest victim's body, Mulder and Detective White find a burn mark {{in the shape of a}} horned beast; Scully says she doesn't see anything. Mulder goes to see White to apologize for Scully's behavior and the two visit the local astrologist Madame Zirinka who claims the town's crazy behavior is due to the rare planetary alignment of the planets Mars, Uranus, and Mercury. Terri and Margi watch basketball practice, lusting over one of the players, Scott, whose girlfriend is fellow cheerleader Brenda (much to Terri and Margi's displeasure). One of the other players accidentally spills a table <b>of</b> <b>drinks</b> on them, so they cause the basketball to bounce underneath the bleachers and it closes when he goes to get it, killing him. Scully is angry at Mulder for ditching her to be with Detective White.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} the public {{discourse}} around drink spiking has evolved from that of an ‘epidemic’ to an ‘urban myth’. This article examines the narratives of 35 young women interviewed {{in relation to the}} contested issue <b>of</b> <b>drink</b> spiking. The suggestion that young women invoke the drink spiking discourse to provide a feminine framework for the masculine practice of binge drinking is challenged. It is argued that, on the contrary, young women’s accounts <b>of</b> <b>drink</b> spiking are characterised by uncertainty, minimisation, self-blame and a reluctance to disclose their experiences. Further, young women’s fear <b>of</b> <b>drink</b> spiking represents a contemporary extension of the conventional gendered fear of sexual violence. Hence a gendered lens, sensitive to the fear and reality of sexual violence, is a prerequisite to a nuanced interpretation of young women’s accounts <b>of</b> <b>drink</b> spiking within the sexualised environment of the night-time economy...|$|R
40|$|The {{report is}} founded on {{evidence}} obtained directly from victims <b>of</b> <b>drink</b> spiking in addition to data received from police in each Australian jurisdiction and data from the Centre Against Sexual Assault. Natalie Taylor, Jeremy Prichard and Kate Charlton highlight {{the degree to which}} drink spiking is under-reported, a fundamental challenge in measuring the extent <b>of</b> <b>drink</b> spiking in the community. Of significant concern is the finding that while one third <b>of</b> all <b>drink</b> spiking incidents are associated with sexual assault, less than one sixth <b>of</b> suspected <b>drink</b> spiking sexual assaults are believed to be reported to police...|$|R

25|$|Pottery samples {{recovered}} from sites in modern Southwestern United States and Northwestern Mexico have {{tested positive for}} the ratio of methylxanthines associated with those produced by Ilex vomitoria. The same study also identified methylxanthines ratios associated with Theobroma cacao. Neither plants are native to the areas from which the pottery samples were recovered, which suggests trading between areas where those plants are native. The chemical analysis also suggests a possible increase in drinks prepared from cacao after the year 1200, and a decrease in the use <b>of</b> <b>drinks</b> prepared from Ilex vomitoria. Freshwater shells from Texas and Arkansas have been {{recovered from}} Pueblo Bonito, which have been used as possible evidence for the trade of Ilex vomitoria from the east. There are also some stands of Ilex vomitoria in Mesoamerica, so the exact origins of the Ilex vomitoria used to prepare the drinks is currently unknown.|$|E
