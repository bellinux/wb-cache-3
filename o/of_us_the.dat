5|$|The smaller {{time frame}} of {{development}} for Left Behind gave the team {{an opportunity to}} trial mechanics and ideas that {{they were unable to}} test on the main game. With the game's combat, an added feature was to allow players to focus the attention of the Infected towards human enemies, allowing an easier escape. The gameplay was also more focused on the characters, as opposed to the combat, to allow players to relate to them more. The gameplay sequences were designed to contrast with other moments of Ellie's life; for example, the water gun fight with Riley is contrasted to the gunfights with enemies. The team found that creating some gameplay mechanics was a challenge, with even fewer combat scenarios in Left Behind than in The Last <b>of</b> <b>Us.</b> <b>The</b> animation of the masks also presented a challenge, due to the number of joints; it took various iterations before the final design was implemented.|$|E

500|$|For The Last <b>of</b> <b>Us,</b> <b>the</b> {{team had}} to create new engines to satisfy their needs. The {{artificial}} intelligence (AI) was created to coordinate with players on an intimate level, {{as opposed to the}} action elements from their previous projects; the addition of Ellie as AI was also a major contributor to the engine. The team intentionally added a feature in which Ellie remains close to Joel, in order to avoid being conceived as a [...] "burden". Programmer Max Dyckhoff stated that, when working on Ellie as AI, he tried to imagine her experiences throughout the game's events, in an attempt to achieve realism. The enemy AI, {{considered one of the most}} important features of the game, was developed to make random choices; they study their surroundings, finding tactics to attack the player. This uniqueness to gameplay was a factor into the attempt at making players feel emotions towards the enemies. The lighting engine was also re-created to incorporate soft light, in which the sunlight seeps in through spaces and reflects off surfaces. The team found great difficulty in developing the gameplay for The Last of Us, as they felt that every mechanic required thorough analysis. [...] "You feel a lot of pressure to add things to make it 'more fun' and it gets super difficult to keep those out sometimes," [...] Druckmann said. In The Last <b>of</b> <b>Us,</b> <b>the</b> weapon that players have equipped change the behavior of the human NPCs. In addition, the stealth system was intentionally developed to offer a sense of desperation, to make players feel the same.|$|E

500|$|The show, {{as well as}} a {{majority}} of UPN's programs, was officially canceled when the network merged with The WB Television Network (The WB) to form The CW in 2006. Fern Gillespie of The Crisis was critical of UPN's decision to cancel the series given how the network [...] "in one swoop, wiped out five of its eight African American comedies" [...] with the creation of The CW. Gillespie expressed disappointment at the lack of African American sitcoms on the three major networks, saying: [...] "Without that opportunity for some of the younger artists to hone and develop their skills, it will potentially have a generational impact."

500|$|His {{position}} persuaded MTV {{to begin}} airing [...] "Billie Jean" [...] and later [...] "Beat It", (along with Prince's [...] "Little Red Corvette") {{which led to}} a long partnership and later helped other black music artists to gain mainstream recognition. MTV denies claims of racism in their broadcasting. The popularity of his videos, such as [...] "Beat It" [...] and [...] "Billie Jean", helped to place the young channel [...] "on the map" [...] and MTV's focus shifted in favor of pop and R Jackson transformed the medium of music video into an art form and promotional tool through the use of complex story lines, dance routines, special effects and cameo appearances by well known personalities. When the 14-minute-long Thriller video aired, MTV ran it twice an hour to meet demand. The short film marked an increase in scale for music videos and has been routinely named the best music video ever. The popularity of the video sent the album back to number one in the album chart, but Jackson's label did not support the release of the third music video from the album. They were already pleased with its success, so Jackson convinced MTV to fund the project. Author, music critic and journalist Nelson George wrote in 2004, [...] "It's difficult to hear the songs from Thriller and disengage them from the videos. For most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> images define the songs. In fact {{it could be argued that}} Michael is the first artist of the MTV age to have an entire album so intimately connected in the public imagination with its imagery". Short films like Thriller largely remained unique to Jackson, while the group dance sequence in [...] "Beat It" [...] has been frequently imitated.
