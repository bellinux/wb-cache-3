25|$|The {{possibility}} to intervene not only exists during pending <b>opposition</b> <b>proceedings</b> before an Opposition Division (i.e., {{during the first}} instance proceedings), but also during subsequent pending appeal proceedings before a Board of Appeal (i.e., during the second instance proceedings).|$|E

25|$|The {{purpose of}} the <b>opposition</b> <b>proceedings</b> is to give opponents, such as competitors, the {{opportunity}} to challenge the validity of a granted European patent. Opponents may also challenge {{only some of the}} claims of the European patent (although this is in practice rather unusual), therefore limiting the framework of the opposition to the challenged claims.|$|E

25|$|In view of {{the grounds}} of opposition, and in view for {{instance}} of a prior art document introduced into the proceedings by the opponent, the patent proprietor may amend the patent, i.e. the description, claims and drawings of the patent, although amendments may not be filed of right at any stage during the <b>opposition</b> <b>proceedings.</b> The patent proprietor is master of its own patent in {{that the decision to}} amend or not, and how to amend the patent, is a decision of the patent proprietor alone (although the Opposition Division or the opponent may apply pressure to have amendments made). The patent, however, may not be amended in such a manner that the amendment would lead to an extension of the protection conferred by the patent.|$|E
25|$|A {{decision}} of the EPO to revoke a European patent is final (when the opportunity to appeal before the EPO is exhausted), which makes the <b>opposition</b> <b>proceedings</b> at the EPO especially attractive for opponents. In contrast, a {{decision of}} the EPO not to revoke a European patent (the decision instead maintaining the patent as granted or in an amended form) leaves the way open for revocation by the national court. The EPO decision does not create an estoppel precluding a subsequent challenge by an unsuccessful opponent {{at the national level}} (at least before the English courts). The validity of a European patent can be scrutinised both at the national level, before a national court, and at the international level, before the European Patent Office during opposition. The same is not true for infringement proceedings, upon which national courts exercise exclusive jurisdiction.|$|E
2500|$|The patent is {{maintained}} as granted. This is the outcome if {{the opposition is}} rejected or if the Opposition Division decides to discontinue the <b>opposition</b> <b>proceedings.</b> The Opposition Division may decide to discontinue the <b>opposition</b> <b>proceedings</b> notably if the sole opposition or all the oppositions have been withdrawn and the patent proprietor is therefore the only remaining party to the proceedings. The withdrawal of an opposition may result from a settlement reached between the proprietor and the opponent.

This notably means that such person does not acquire the [...] "bundle of procedural rights" [...] created [...] "in respect of the opponent", such as the right to be heard before any decision is taken. Observations by third parties, which must be filed in writing, may be filed by post or online. According to Board of Appeal 3.3.08, the observations have to be signed [...] "in order to allow an identification of the third party" [...] and, unless [...] "adopted by a party to the proceedings as its own" [...] or by the competent organ of the EPO of its own motion, [...] "anonymous third party observations are to be disregarded altogether." ...|$|E

"it {{is within}} the {{discretion}} of the instances of the EPO to raise the objection in opposition or <b>opposition</b> appeal <b>proceedings</b> against proposed amended claims, but this should be done only in clear cases.

25|$|During the <b>opposition,</b> oral <b>proceedings</b> {{may take}} place {{at the request of the}} EPO or at the request of any party to the proceedings, i.e. the {{patentee}} or an opponent. The oral proceedings are held before the Opposition Division itself. They are held in Munich, the Hague or Berlin, and are public unless very particular circumstances apply. This contrasts with oral proceedings held before an Examining Division, which are not public. The list of public oral <b>proceedings</b> in <b>opposition</b> before the EPO is available on its web site. The right to oral proceedings is a specific and codified part of the procedural right to be heard. A decision is often taken at the end of the oral proceedings.|$|R
5000|$|Under {{the case}} {{law of the}} Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office (EPO), a Board cannot put a sole {{appellant}} in a worse position than {{if he had not}} appealed the first instance decision. Hence in relation to appeals, the term [...] "prohibition of reformatio in peius" [...] essentially means that a person should not be placed in a worse position as a result of filing an appeal. Thus, in general, EPO Boards of Appeal are prevented in <b>opposition</b> appeal <b>proceedings</b> from going beyond the request of a sole appellant to put it in a worse position than it was before it appealed. The central case detailing this principle is G 4/93 consolidated with G 9/92.|$|R
2500|$|If {{amendments}} {{are made}} to the patent during the <b>opposition</b> <b>proceedings,</b> the patent (and the invention to which it relates) must {{meet the requirements of}} the EPC. These requirements notably include the requirements of support in the description and clarity (...) , even though those are not listed as grounds of opposition in [...] However, the requirements to be met by the amended patent do not include the requirement of unity of invention (because divisionals cannot be filed after grant).|$|E

[...] "For example, as of 2008, Belgium and France will stay the main proceeding until a final decision has been reached by the EPO whereas in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and in the United Kingdom such a stay is not automatic and in most cases the courts will continue the proceedings notwithstanding the opposition. ... However, in Germany national nullity proceedings cannot be started before the Federal Patent Court until the EPO <b>opposition</b> <b>proceedings</b> have been concluded or the opposition period has expired." ...|$|E

50|$|From the {{technical}} point of view, the Regulation {{brought about a}} number of changes in the areas of graphic representation of the mark, examination proceedings, absolute grounds of refusal, relative grounds of refusal, goods and services, <b>opposition</b> and cancellation <b>proceedings</b> and appeals.

2500|$|Each {{party to}} the <b>opposition</b> <b>proceedings</b> {{normally}} bears the costs it has incurred, unless the Opposition Division (or, in appeal proceedings, the Board of Appeal under [...] ), for reasons of equity, orders a different apportionment of costs. For example, in case T 1306/05, a highly relevant document had been lately filed, without any valid justification, by the opponent during the oral proceedings before the Board of Appeal, thus rendering useless both the oral proceedings and the patent proprietor preparation thereto. A different apportionment of costs has been ordered by the Board of Appeal. The patent proprietor has requested, under [...] and , about €26,000 to be paid by the opponent.|$|E
2500|$|In most jurisdictions, {{there are}} ways for third parties to {{challenge}} the validity of an allowed or issued patent at the national patent office; these are called <b>opposition</b> <b>proceedings.</b> [...] It is also possible to challenge the validity of a patent in court. In either case, the challenging party tries {{to prove that the}} patent should never have been granted. There are several grounds for challenges: the claimed subject matter is not patentable subject matter at all; [...] the claimed subject matter was actually not new, or was obvious to experts in the field, at the time the application was filed; or that some kind of fraud was committed during prosecution with regard to listing of inventors, representations about when discoveries were made, etc. [...] Patents can be found to be invalid {{in whole or in part}} for any of these reasons.|$|E

60|$|The {{place where}} the {{consultation}} was held, at which this appointment was made, was Triparadeisus,[F] in Syria. This was the {{place where the}} expedition of Antipater, coming from Asia Minor, met the army of Egypt on its return. As soon as the junction of the two armies was effected, and the grand council was convened, Eurydice made the most violent <b>opposition</b> to the <b>proceedings.</b> Antipater reproved her for evincing such turbulence and insubordination of spirit. This made her more angry than ever; and when at length Antipater was appointed to the regency, she went out and made a formal harangue to the army, in which she denounced Antipater in the severest terms, and loaded him with criminations and reproaches, and endeavored to incite the soldiers to a revolt. Antipater endeavored to defend himself against these accusations by a calm reply; but the influence which Eurydice's tempestuous eloquence exerted on the minds of the soldiery was too much for him. A very serious riot ensued, which threatened to lead to the most disastrous results. For a time Antipater's life was in most imminent danger, and he was saved only by the interposition of some of the other generals, who hazarded their own lives to rescue him from the enraged soldiery.|$|R
2500|$|When Indian media began {{citing the}} CAG report {{identifying}} the loss at 1.76trillion (short scale), the Indian opposition parties unanimously demanded {{the formation of}} a joint parliamentary committee to investigate the scam. Although the government rejected their demand, when the winter session of Parliament began on 9 November 2010 the opposition again pressed for a JPC; again, their demand was rejected. The demand for a JPC gained further momentum when the CAG report was tabled in Parliament on 16 November 2010. The <b>opposition</b> blocked the <b>proceedings,</b> again pressing for a JPC; the government again rejected their demand, creating an impasse. Speaker of the Lok Sabha Meira Kumar unsuccessfully attempted to resolve the impasse. The winter session of Parliament concluded on 13 December 2010. Although 22 new bills were planned to be introduced, 23 pending bills passed and three bills withdrawn, Parliament functioned for only nine hours. On 22 February 2011, after resisting opposition demands for over three months, the government announced that it would form a JPC. The JPC criticised the CBI for its leniency to the PM, the Attorney General, Dayanidhi Maran and Chidambaram and its reluctance to investigate their roles on 24 July 2012. After questioning former telecom minister Dayanidhi Maran, his brother Kalanithi and the head of Maxis Communications, the CBI alleged that the Maran brothers accrued an illegal 5.50billion by the sale of Sun Direct TV shares at highly [...] "inflated prices".|$|R

60|$|In 1651 {{originated}} {{the policy}} which caused the American Revolution. That policy {{was one of}} taxation, indirect, it is true, but none the less taxation. The first Navigation Act required that colonial exports should be shipped to England in American or English vessels. This {{was followed by a}} long series of acts, regulating and restricting the American trade. Colonists were not allowed to exchange certain articles without paying duties thereon, and custom houses were established and officers appointed. <b>Opposition</b> to these <b>proceedings</b> was ineffectual; and in 1696, in order to expedite the business of taxation, and to establish a better method of ruling the colonies, a board was appointed, called the Lords Commissioners for Trade and Plantations. The royal governors found in this board ready sympathizers, and were not slow to report their grievances, and to insist upon more stringent regulations for enforcing obedience. Some of the retaliative measures employed were the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, the abridgment of the freedom of the press and the prohibition of elections. But the colonists generally succeeded in having their own way in the end, and were not wholly without encouragement and sympathy in the English Parliament. It may be that the war with France, which ended with the fall of Quebec, {{had much to do with}} this rather generous treatment. The Americans, too, were favored by the Whigs, who had been in power for more than seventy years. The policy of this great party was not opposed to the sentiments and ideas of political freedom that had grown up in the colonies; and, although more than half of the Navigation Acts were passed by Whig governments, the leaders had known how to wink at the violation of nearly all of them.|$|R
