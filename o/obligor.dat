25|$|The penal bond {{is another}} type of the bond that was {{historically}} used to assure {{the performance of a}} contract. They are to be distinguished from surety bonds in that they did not require any party to act as surety—having an obligee and <b>obligor</b> sufficed. One historically significant type of penal bond, the penal bond with conditional defeasance, printed the bond (the obligation to pay) {{on the front of the}} document and the condition which would nullify that promise to pay (referred to as the indenture of defeasance—essentially, the contractual obligation) on the back of the document. The penal bond, although an artifact of historical interest, fell out of use by the early part of the nineteenth century in the United States.|$|E

Among active {{states of}} mind, there is, however, one species which merits {{particular}} attention, because {{it forms a}} principal part of the connotation of some important classes of names. I mean volitions, or acts of the will. When we speak of sentient beings by relative names, {{a large portion of}} the connotation of the name usually consists of the actions of those beings; actions past, present, and possible or probable future. Take, for instance, the words Sovereign and Subject. What meaning do these words convey, but that of innumerable actions, done or to be done by the sovereign and the subjects, to or in regard to one another reciprocally? So with the words physician and patient, leader and follower, tutor and pupil. In many cases the words also connote actions which would be done under certain contingencies by persons other than those denoted: as the words mortgagor and mortgagee, <b>obligor</b> and obligee, and many other words expressive of legal relation, which connote what a court of justice would do to enforce the legal obligation if not fulfilled. There are also words which connote actions previously done by persons other than those denoted either by the name itself or by its correlative; as the word brother. From these instances, it may be seen how large a portion of the connotation of names consists of actions. Now what is an action? Not one thing, but a series of two things: the state of mind called a volition, followed by an effect. The volition or intention to produce the effect, is one thing; the effect produced in consequence of the intention, is another thing; the two together constitute the action. I form the purpose of instantly moving my arm; that is a state of my mind: my arm (not being tied or paralytic) moves in obedience to my purpose; that is a physical fact, consequent on a state of mind. The intention, followed by the fact, or (if we prefer the expression) the fact when preceded and caused by the intention, is called the action of moving my arm.|$|E

However, an <b>obligor</b> who has had his solidarity renounced would never be liable for more than his fair portion if an <b>obligor</b> never becomes insolvent. In this way renunciation of solidarity can be viewed as a middle ground between complete obligation in solido and from the complete freedom from obligation that remission of debt results in.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the risk of}} a portfolio comprised of loans, bonds, and financial instruments that are subject to possible default. We are interested in efficiently estimating expected excess loss conditioned on the event that the portfolio incurs large losses over a fixed time horizon; this risk measure {{is often referred to as}} expected shortfall. We consider a heterogeneous mix of <b>obligors</b> and assume a portfolio dependence structure that supports extremal dependence among <b>obligors</b> and does not hinge solely on correlation. We first derive sharp asymptotics that illustrate the implications of extremal dependence among <b>obligors</b> in the risk of the portfolio.

The Commission stated that, “The {{purposes of this}} act are to improve and extend by reciprocal legislation the enforcement of duties of support and to make uniform the law with respect thereto.” URESA sought to enforce the provisions in two ways: criminal enforcement and civil enforcement. Criminal enforcement relied upon the obligee state demanding the extradition of the <b>obligor,</b> or for the <b>obligor</b> to surrender. Civil enforcement relied upon the obligee to initiate proceedings in his/her state. The initiating state would determine if the <b>obligor</b> had a duty of support. If the initiating court upheld the claim, the initiating court would forward {{the case to the}} obligor’s state. The responding state, having personal jurisdiction over the <b>obligor,</b> would provide notice and a hearing for <b>obligor.</b> After this hearing, the responding court would enforce the support order.|$|E

40|$|Monte Carlo {{simulation}} {{is widely}} {{used to measure the}} credit risk in portfolios of loans, corporate bonds, and other instruments subject to possible default. The accurate measurement of credit risk is often a rare-event simulation problem because default probabilities are low for highly rated <b>obligors</b> and because risk management is particularly concerned with rare but significant losses resulting from a large number of defaults. This makes importance sampling (IS) potentially attractive. But the application of IS is complicated by the mechanisms used to model dependence between <b>obligors,</b> and capturing this dependence is essential to a portfolio view of credit risk. This paper provides an IS procedure for the widely used normal copula model of portfolio credit risk. The procedure has two parts: One applies IS conditional on a set of common factors affecting multiple <b>obligors,</b> the other applies IS to the factors themselves. The relative importance of the two parts of the procedure is determined by the strength of the dependence between <b>obligors.</b> We provide both theoretical and numerical support for the method.

At this stage, because the assignee [...] "stands in the shoes" [...] of the assignor, the <b>obligor</b> can raise any defense to the contract that the <b>obligor</b> could have raised against the assignor. Furthermore, the <b>obligor</b> can raise against the assignee counterclaims and setoffs that the <b>obligor</b> had against the assignor. For example, suppose that A makes a contract to paint B's house in exchange for $500. A then assigns the right to receive the $500 to C, to pay off a debt owed to C. However, A does such a careless job painting the house that B has to pay another painter $400 to correct A's work. If C sues B to collect the debt, B can raise his counterclaim for the expenses caused by the poor paint job, and can reduce the amount owed to C by that $400, leaving only $100 to be collected.|$|E

40|$|Between 1988 and 1991, {{variation}} in the amounts of child support awards across states declined, {{with the exception of}} awards for low-income <b>obligors.</b> Nevertheless, there remain enormous differences in the amount of support dictated by state child support guidelines. For lowincome <b>obligors,</b> support awards in 1991 ranged between $ 25 and $ 327, while for the highest-income <b>obligors</b> they ranged between $ 616 and $ 1607. This {{variation in}} awards was not found to result from differences in the cost of living across states. Hence the large differences in support awards across states for <b>obligors</b> in identical family and financial situations give rise to serious equity considerations and suggest the development of a federal standard for setting awards. Further, in many states, nominal and inflation-adjusted support awards declined between 1988 and 199 1. Overall, nonresident parents do not pay a fair share of the costs of raising their children. Given that children now constitute the largest group of individuals living in poverty in the United States, emphasis should be placed on larger awards, expressing child support obligations as a percentage of income, and a child support assurance program.
