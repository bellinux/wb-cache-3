5|$|King and the SCLC {{put into}} {{practice}} many {{of the principles of}} the Christian Left and applied the tactics of nonviolent protest with great success by strategically choosing the method of protest and the places in which protests were carried <b>out.</b> <b>There</b> were often dramatic stand-offs with segregationist authorities, who sometimes turned violent.|$|E
5|$|Whale {{directed}} his final film in 1950, a short subject {{based on the}} William Saroyan one-act play Hello <b>Out</b> <b>There.</b> The film, financed by supermarket heir Huntington Hartford, {{was the story of}} a man in a Texas jail falsely accused of rape and the woman who cleans the jail. Hartford intended for the short to be part of an anthology film along the lines of Quartet. However, attempts to find appropriate short fiction companion pieces to adapt were unsuccessful and Hello <b>Out</b> <b>There</b> was never commercially released.|$|E
5|$|And by {{the time}} they got it all {{organized}} and figured <b>out,</b> <b>there</b> were really only a couple of songs left for me to do anything on. So I came into L.A. for a couple of days and Kasim... came in, as was the routine, and we did maybe three songs... just so that I’d have a few fingerprints on the record. I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|E

5|$|Asked {{what impact}} {{the money would}} have on him, Kinsler said: I'm {{going to play the}} same {{regardless}} of whether I'm making five dollars or $1 trillion. It really doesn't make a difference to me. I'm going to go <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and play hard, and money doesn't bring respect. The way you play the game brings respect.

5|$|Macrae, Ismay and Churchill all saw fit {{to record}} these {{arguments}} over the technical issue of stickiness. As Eden had pointed <b>out,</b> <b>there</b> {{was a lot}} at stake.

What was needed was a hand weapon to deliver a coup de grâce by punching through the armoured plate. The sticky bomb could do the job and little else was available.|$|E
