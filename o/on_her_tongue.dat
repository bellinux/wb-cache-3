2500|$|Crying {{and with}} compassion, {{she began to}} think about the {{foreskin}} of Christ, where it may be located [...] And behold, soon she felt with the greatest sweetness <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue</b> a little piece of skin alike the skin in an egg, which she swallowed. After she had swallowed it, she again felt the little skin <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue</b> with sweetness as before, and again she swallowed it. And this happened to her about a hundred times. And when she felt it so frequently, she was tempted to touch it with her finger. And when she wanted to do so, that little skin went down her throat on its own. And it was told to her that the foreskin was resurrected with the Lord on the day of resurrection. And so great was the sweetness of tasting that little skin that she felt in all [...] limbs and parts of the limbs a sweet transformation.|$|E
6000|$|... "And I'm Mrs. Roberts," [...] Saxon replied, thrilling to the newness of the {{designation}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue.</b> [...] "My first name is Saxon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My lord duke," [...] said Alicia, [...] "so {{as the man}} is straight"--And there, in {{a perfect}} consternation, the voice died <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Geraldine had it <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue's</b> {{end that}} Alice would be difficult, {{for want of}} {{anything}} distinctive, but Felix and Edgar were both jotting something down, and Robina was before-hand with either-- 'Scarlet pimpernel, tortoiseshell butterfly, budgerigar, marmoset.' ...|$|R

50|$|The {{stepmother}} {{returned with}} an ointment {{that would work}} only if the true bride had really been drowned; she put it <b>on</b> <b>her</b> daughter's <b>tongue</b> and found it did not work. The prince found them and said they deserved to die, but the stepdaughter had persuaded him to merely abandon them on a desert island.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Poyser {{hastened to}} {{the door for the}} {{pleasure}} of looking at her darling in a new position, with love in her eyes but reproof <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue.</b>|$|E
60|$|The girl well {{knew this}} goblet {{contained}} a vile poison, one drop of which <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue</b> would cause death; so she hesitated, trembling and shrinking from the ordeal.|$|E
60|$|The storm {{passed as}} quickly as it came, and Alice sat upright casting off the wraps. But once checked with the fact <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue,</b> she found it hard to utter it.|$|E
60|$|It {{would not}} yield to her {{intimate}} {{manipulation of the}} old latch--a bad sign, and the bell re-echoed in vacancy. Again and again she rang, each moment of exclusion awakening a fresh yearning towards the cedar fragrance, every stare of passer-by making her long for the safe shelter of the bay-windowed parlour. At last a step approached, and a greeting for the friendly old servant was <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue's</b> end. Alas! a strange face met her eye, elderly, respectable, but guarded. Miss Charlecote was not at home, not in town, not at Hiltonbury--gone abroad, whither was not known. Mrs. Jones? Dead {{more than a year}} ago. Every reply was followed by an attempt to close the door, and it needed all Lucy's native hardihood, all her ardent craving for her former home, to venture on an entreaty to be admitted for a few minutes. She was answered, that the house might be shown to no one without orders from Mr. Parsons.|$|R
60|$|Bertrade de Montfort did {{not know}} how to answer so ridiculous a sophistry; and, truth to tell, she was more than pleased to hear from the lips of Roger de Conde what bored <b>her</b> <b>on</b> the <b>tongues</b> of other men.|$|R
6000|$|Maisie had it <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue's</b> end {{to return}} once more: [...] "But now he's free." [...] She remembered, however, {{in time that}} one of the things she had known for the last entire hour was that this made no difference. After that, and as if to turn the right way, she was on the point of a blind dash, a weak {{reversion}} to the reminder that it might make a difference, might diminish the crime for Mrs. Beale; till such a reflexion was in its order also quashed by the visibility in Mrs. Wix's face of the collapse produced by her inference from her pupil's manner that after all her pains her pupil didn't even yet adequately understand. Never so much as when confronted had Maisie wanted to understand, and all her thought for a minute centred in the effort to come out with something which should be a disproof of her simplicity. [...] "Just TRUST me, dear; that's all!"--she came out finally with that; and it was perhaps a good sign of her action that with a long, impartial moan Mrs. Wix floated her to bed.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Markham turned with a scowl on {{her face}} and a biting word <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue,</b> but {{something}} in the sweet, round little face of the other woman silenced her, and her brow smoothed out.|$|E
60|$|It was Mary's {{turn now}} to show offense, and a sharp retort was <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue</b> when {{suddenly}} she realized the folly of such a useless quarrel. Instead {{she put her arms}} about Joan and kissed her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, yes. I am {{not like}} to forget it, and nightly do I pray," [...] she went <b>on,</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue</b> outrunning {{discretion}} and betraying her feelings for Galliard, [...] "that God may punish those murderers who wrecked his existence." ...|$|E
6000|$|Rachel again became {{cold and}} stern, {{and did not}} relent at the {{description}} of Charlie's horror and agony; for she was wondering at the audacity of mentioning his grief to the wife of Lady Keith's brother, and thinking that this weak, indulgent mother was the very person to make a foolish, mischievous son, and it was <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue's</b> end {{that she did not}} see to what she was indebted for the favour of such a visit. Perhaps Mrs. Carleton perceived her resentment, for she broke off, and urgently asked if poor dear Lady Keith had alluded to anything that had passed. [...] "Yes," [...] Rachel was is forced to say; and when again pressed as to the manner of alluding, replied, that [...] "she was exceedingly distressed and displeased," [...] with difficulty refraining from saying who had done all the mischief. Mrs. Carleton was in no need of hearing it. [...] "Ah!" [...] she said, [...] "it was right, quite right. It was very wrong of my poor boy. Indeed I am not excusing him, but if you only knew how he blames himself." ...|$|R
40|$|A neonate with a swollen tongue A full-term female infant {{weighing}} 3. 1 kg {{was delivered}} by uncomplicated vaginal delivery and required no resuscitation. She was {{reviewed by the}} neonatal team soon after birth due to a swollen tongue (figure 1). <b>On</b> examination, <b>her</b> <b>tongue</b> was protruding {{and there was a}} large cystic lesion at its tip which transilluminated. She had no other dysmorphic features or associations and her airway was not compromised. She received nasogastric tube feeds because of difficulty latching on. An MRI scan demonstrated a unilocular cyst with no abnor-malities in the surrounding tissue and was suggestive of a mucous retention cyst. The cyst ruptured spontaneously on day 3 of life before going to theatre. She rapidly established breast feeding and was dis...|$|R
60|$|These facts Miss Mary was not slow {{to take a}} {{feminine}} advantage of, in her present humor. But it was somewhat confusing to observe, also, that the beast, despite some faint signs of past dissipation, was amiable-looking,--in fact, a kind of blond Samson, whose corn-colored silken beard apparently had never yet known the touch of barber's razor or Delilah's shears. So that the cutting speech which quivered <b>on</b> <b>her</b> ready <b>tongue</b> died upon <b>her</b> lips, and she contented herself with receiving his stammering apology with supercilious eyelids and the gathered skirts of uncontamination. When she reentered the schoolroom, her eyes fell upon the azaleas with {{a new sense of}} revelation; and then she laughed, and the little people all laughed, and they were all unconsciously very happy.|$|R
60|$|Neither of {{them had}} quite {{anticipated}} the result, namely, that the next morning, Cis, after kissing the Queen's hand as usual, remained kneeling, her bosom heaving, and a little stammering <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue,</b> while tears rose to her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not going}} to be a surgeon, thank heaven; I intend to make perfect hands and arms, not mend damaged ones," [...] {{retorted}} Psyche, in a dignified tone, somewhat marred by a great piece of court-plaster <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, I {{was just}} {{thinking}} that possibly this young Italian girl might {{know something about the}} lugger, and, as she clearly loves the Frenchman, we should get a strong purchase <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue</b> by means of her heart." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1995, {{two decades}} after Lightfoot's {{original}} song was written, singer-songwriter Camille West recorded a parody song with a similar rhythm titled [...] "The Nervous Wreck of Edna Fitzgerald," [...] about a well-to-do family's disastrous day at sea. She recorded and released it <b>on</b> <b>her</b> album Mother <b>Tongue</b> (subtitled [...] "Maternal Madness, Month by Month") that year. Ten years later, after she had joined the band Four Bitchin' Babes, she and the band performed the song live, prefacing it with the comment, [...] "With apologies to Gordon Lightfoot." [...] It was included on their album of that year, Gabby Road.|$|R
6000|$|She {{rolled a}} mouthful of apricot ice reflectively <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue,</b> and then murmured, in a similar aside, [...] "Don't ask me now. Some other time will, do. But I mean what I say. Believe me; I do not speak at random." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will try}} and bring you some mixture for it," [...] said Mrs Carbonel. And then she spoke to Betsy Seddon, who for a wonder had no request <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue,</b> and asked her who the other woman was, in the hedge with the baby.|$|E
60|$|It was <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue</b> {{to speak}} some {{word about the}} hospital; but she felt {{that if she did}} so now, it would be {{tantamount}} to asking him that question which it did not become her to ask; so she repressed the word, and sat in silence.|$|E
6000|$|His {{hand was}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> mouth, {{but that was}} needless, for <b>her</b> <b>tongue</b> clove to its roof, and her power of {{utterance}} was gone. 'I {{have been looking for}} you many nights. Is the house empty? Answer me. Is any one inside?' ...|$|R
5000|$|To {{stop her}} rampage, Shiva awakens from his trance and lies {{down in front}} of Kali. She steps on him, realizes that she had stepped <b>on</b> <b>her</b> husband (which is a sin in Indian culture) and sticks out <b>her</b> <b>tongue</b> in shame.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not she--you know it {{will never}} do to alarm a pulmonary, so Mrs. Budd has held <b>her</b> <b>tongue</b> {{carefully}} <b>on</b> the subject before the young woman.

60|$|She {{had that}} morning {{determined}} {{to check his}} further advances, until she had thoroughly considered her position. The remonstrance was now <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue,</b> but as accident would have it, before the word could be spoken Mrs. Leat was stepping from the last stair to the floor, and no remonstrance came.|$|E
60|$|Miss Panney hesitated. It {{would be}} a bold thing to give the answer that was <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue,</b> but she was no coward, {{and this was a}} crisis of importance. A proper {{impression}} made upon this woman might be productive of more good results than if made upon any one else.|$|E
60|$|She turned {{with a sharp}} word <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue,</b> {{but he was so}} {{frank and}} so handsome, and withal so humble, that she {{instantly}} relented.
