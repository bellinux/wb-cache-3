The composer George Dyson wrote, [...] "In a certain sense the very rebellion he fought was the most obvious fruit of his methods. And in view of what some of these rebels have since achieved, <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> wonder whether there is really anything better a teacher can do for his pupils than drive them into various forms of revolution." [...] The works of some of Stanford's pupils, including Holst and Vaughan Williams, entered the general repertory in Britain, {{and to some extent}} elsewhere, as Stanford's never did. For many years after his death it seemed that Stanford's greatest fame would be as a teacher. Among his achievements at the RCM was the establishment of an opera class, with at least one operatic production every year. From 1885 to 1915 there were 32 productions, all of them conducted by Stanford.|$|E

[...] In 1954, Tallchief was given the role of Sugar Plum Fairy in Balanchine's newly reworked version of The Nutcracker, then an obscure ballet. Her performance of the role helped transform the work into an annual Christmas classic, and the industry's most reliable box-office draw. Critic Walter Terry remarked [...] "Maria Tallchief, as the Sugar Plum Fairy, is herself a creature of magic, dancing the seemingly impossible with effortless beauty of movement, electrifying us with her brilliance, enchanting us with her radiance of being.

2500|$|On November 6, the Sixth Circuit ruled 2–1 that Kentucky's ban on {{same-sex}} marriage does {{not violate the}} constitution. It said it was bound by the U.S. Supreme Court's 1972 action in a similar case, Baker v. Nelson, which dismissed a same-sex couple's marriage claim [...] "for want of a substantial federal question." [...] Writing for the majority, Judge Jeffrey Sutton also dismissed the arguments made on behalf of same-sex couples in this case: [...] "Not one of the plaintiffs' theories, however, makes the case for constitutionalizing the definition of marriage and for removing the issue from the place {{it has been since}} the founding: in the hands of state voters."

The grand prize also contained a spot in the travelling Rock Show '93 and performances at the L'Europe d'Art d'Art festival in Niort, France, the Nordic Rock '93 competition that they also won, and all the major Danish summer festivals. A reviewer from that time remarked, [...] "They are not quite as extroverted as one might have expected, but in return they play much better than one might dare hope for.

2500|$|From {{the time}} of her {{marriage}} through the 1920s Cotton lived mainly in London and Paris, making frequent visits to New York. She showed her work infrequently in New York galleries, instead inviting acquaintances to her studio to see recently completed portraits and ones still in progress. These events, usually afternoon teas, became popular among the social set in which she moved. On the occasions that she did show her work in New York galleries the exhibitions were widely reported in the press. For example, when in 1917 she showed fifteen portraits she had made in Paris over the previous few years, the exhibition attracted notice from the New York Herald, the Christian Science Monitor, the Sun, the Schenectady Gazette, American Art News, and the Fine Arts Journal. Reviewers praised the show in general, saw some unevenness in the quality of her work, and were impressed with both the social standing and attractiveness of her sitters. One influential critic, Henry McBride, said [...] "Mrs. Cotton realizes her personages for us so vividly that <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> run off into personal gossip rather than to thread the tedious intricacies of a discussion of artistic technique." [...] During the years when she made her home abroad Cotton had paintings accepted for exhibition in the annual Paris Salons. Her appearances were infrequent early in her career and nearly annual during the 1920s.|$|E
