40|$|Within {{the context}} of Basic Oxygen Steelmaking, the {{refinement}} of high silicon hot metal is a cumbersome operation due to the strong tendency for slopping as the silicon concentration in the hot metal increases. According to generally recognized steel working practices, this issue could be resolved by a double-deslagging (slag removal) operation. In the present study, a new operating practice has been defined that eliminates slopping and increases productivity. The new tested procedure is a single-slag operation that results in {{a reduction in the}} tap to -tap time and greater gas recovery, affecting neither the slopping control nor the quality of the steel obtained {{at the end of the}} <b>oxygen</b> <b>blow.</b> The feasibility of such a new practice has been verified through a critical analysis of the results from thirty 30 experimental tests carried out at the industrial converters of a steel plant...|$|E

The heat of released from these kind of reactions could help to decrease the electricity needed for fusion of iron and steel for metallurgical purposes in the electrical arc furnaces.

Oxygen forms oxides with the unwanted elements, such as carbon, silicon, phosphorus, and manganese, which appear from various states of the manufacturing process.

40|$|A {{study has}} been {{conducted}} to examine the influence of slag evolution on BOF dephosphorisation. An experimental technique was developed where slag/metal emulsion samples {{were obtained from the}} BOF during processing. The observed evolution of slag composition was consistent with many previous studies, where {{in the first half of}} the blow slags high in (%SiO 2) and low in (%FeO) are generated. During the second half of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>blow,</b> (FeO) generation and lime dissolution improve the slag basicity and contribute to the transfer of phosphorus from metal to slag. Poor levels of phosphorus removal during the centre region of the blow were found to coincide with a minimum in the (%FeO) composition. By the end of blow, 70 % of the mass of phosphorus in the furnace is present in the slag, and the extent of phosphorus removal is proportional to the slag basicity and the (%FeO) concentration in the slag. By utilizing mass balance calculations to estimate the mass of slag in the furnace, it was shown that at tap, approximately 30 % of lime and 50 % of magnesia remain undissolved in a liquid slag saturated in both components. It was concluded that the mass of lime added to the furnace could be reduced without influencing the dissolved concentration of (%CaO), and therefore without deteriorating the extent of dephosphorisation...|$|E

The Transport Gasifier is an advanced circulating fluidized-bed gasifier designed to operate as either a combustor or a gasifier in air- or oxygen-blown mode using a particulate control device (PCD). The Transport Gasifier was operated as a pressurized gasifier in air- and oxygen-blown modes during TC 08. Test Run TC 08 was started on June 9, 2002 and completed on June 29. Both gasifier and PCD operations were stable during the test run with a stable baseline pressure drop. The oxygen feed supply system worked well and the transition from air to <b>oxygen</b> <b>blown</b> was smooth. The gasifier temperature was varied between 1, 710 and 1, 770 F at pressures from 125 to 240 psig. The gasifier operates at lower pressure during oxygen-blown mode due to the supply pressure of the oxygen system. In TC 08, 476 hours of solid circulation and 364 hours of coal feed were attained with 153 hours of pure oxygen feed.

All of these gasifiers were integrated with a combined cycle using a gas turbine firing temperature of 1700 K (2600 F) and a compressor pressure ratio of 16 : 1. Steam turbine throttle conditions were chosen to be 16. 6 MPa/ 811 K (2400 psia/ 1000 F) with a single reheat to 810 K (1000 F).

40|$|The {{production}} of raw steel at SSAB EMEA in Luleå {{is carried out}} in basic oxygen steelmaking furnaces (BOF), where dissolved carbon in pig iron is reduced to a level less than 2 % through the reaction with oxygen. Simultaneously, a slag phase is formed consisting of oxidized impurities from the metal phase and slag formers. To prevent slag from escaping to the steel ladle {{in the end of}} the tapping performance, SSAB EMEA in Luleå uses a slag stopper system consisting of mainly two units; a slag detection device followed by a unit that mechanically is forcing the slag back into the furnace. The latter device utilizes a high pressure of inert nitrogen gas coming from a nozzle that is positioned in front of the tap hole. The slag stopper system was introduced in spring and autumn of 2010 in which the system enables a better control of carried-over slag. To allow for an optimized tapping performance with a low amount of carried-over slag combined with a high iron exchange, metallurgical studies focused on the tapping action were performed during spring 2011. The aim of this thesis was to find which parameters that have the largest influence on carried-over slag by creating a multivariate statistically model. Since no measurements on carried-over slag are normally performed in daily practice, methods to estimate this parameter where searched for in the literature. To get an estimation of carried-over slag, slag samples and measurements on the slag thickness in the ladle were collected. Estimated carried-over slag and iron exchange were considered together with process data when creating statistical models in the computer program SIMCA-P+ 12. 0 (SIMCA). The purpose was to enable an evaluation of the correlations existing among process parameters and the outcome of the tapping performance. When estimated values for carried-over slag were evaluated against a number representing how much slag that had been detected during tapping (SMI), statistical models with the strongest correlations were formed. From these, {{it was found that the}} addition of limestone and the temperature of the steel after <b>oxygen</b> <b>blowing</b> have an indicated strong negative correlation with carried-over slag. A reverse but strong relationship was also indicated for the sulphur content in charged pig iron. With respect to the iron exchange, a strong positive correlation was found with the steel temperature after <b>oxygen</b> <b>blowing</b> according to the model. Under the assumption that the statistical models are true, the temperature of steel seems to be an essential parameter to control and thereby, to achieve an optimized tapping performance in the LD converter. During further evaluation of the models it was indicated that the amount of reduced carry-over slag by adding limestone after <b>oxygen</b> <b>blowing</b> is independent of steel type. According to the model, the correlation between SMI and the amount of LD-slag escaped to the ladle was found to be SMI∙ 177 kg. It was also found that an old tap hole in comparison to a new one would contribute to 80 kg additional amount of LD-slag in the ladle. However, the models must be further evaluated to confirm the indicated correlations between carry-over slag and process parameters. This since some underlying process conditions may have contributed to misleading results. Validerat; 20111011 (anonymous...|$|R

Since the gasifier uses a dry feed system and does not slag the ash, it is particularly well-suited for high moisture fuels such as subbituminous coal and lignite. As of September 2006, the gasifier has achieved over 7, 100 hours of gasification using subbituminous Powder River Basin (PRB) coal and over 700 hours of gasification using lignite. The gasifier has operated in both air <b>blown</b> and <b>oxygen</b> <b>blown</b> modes with both fuels. Using PRB coal in previous test runs, the gasifier yielded raw wet lower heating values of u...|$|R
