5|$|In addition, {{there are}} eight {{different}} neighborhood associations, each of which provides different levels of infrastructure on each street. For example, on 4th Street the street lights are designed as old lamp posts and there are ornamented trash cans with a fleur-de-lis symbol at frequent intervals, while on St. James Court there are gas lamp posts, 3rd and 2nd Streets have small light posts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks,</b> Ouerbacker Court has cast iron decorative gates, and several other streets have basic infrastructure.|$|E

25|$|As on Coney Island, Marsh {{captured}} {{the crowds of}} the bustling inner city life. Marsh {{spent a lot of}} his time <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks,</b> the subways, the nightclubs, bars and restaurants finding the crowds. He also loved to single people out on the trains, in the parks, or in ballrooms to capture a single human figure in isolation {{from the rest of the}} city.|$|E

25|$|The {{divide between}} rich and poor can be seen in areas such as Atenas Street. Here, next to the Palacio de Covian, the site of the Secretary of the Government, there is a {{building}} damaged by the 1985 earthquake in which nine families live illegally. These families do not pay rent and the owner wants to evict them. These families earn money by selling crafts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> in the colonia or by washing clothes. There are families that live on the streets here who survive on 20 pesos a day.|$|E
25|$|In more {{sophisticated}} {{systems such as}} large cities, this concept is further extended: some streets are marked as being one-way, and on those streets all traffic must flow in only one direction, but pedestrians <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> are generally not limited to one-way movement. A driver wishing to reach a destination he already passed must use other streets in order to return. Usage of one-way streets, despite the inconveniences it can bring to individual drivers, can greatly improve traffic flow since they usually allow traffic to move faster and tend to simplify intersections.|$|E
25|$|It was {{difficult}} to promenade in the narrow streets, crowded, without sidewalks and filled with wagons, carts, carriages and animals. At {{the beginning of the}} century Parisians preferred to promenade on the wide Pont Neuf. As the century advanced, they were attracted to the new boulevards, built on the site of the old city walls, and to the new Champs-Élysées, where the first large town houses were being constructed. As the boulevards attracted crowds, they also attracted street entertainers; acrobats, musicians, dancers, and every kind of trained animal performed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Cyclists may travel {{either in}} <b>the</b> street or <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> they must behave {{so as not}} to cause danger to {{pedestrians}} (which is an arbitrary judgment that seems to translate into traveling at walking pace). Moreover, in some of the cities within the greater Los Angeles region, it is illegal to cycle <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk.</b> Cyclists in general should follow the same traffic rules and behavior as motorized vehicles. It is legal for a cyclist to [...] "take a lane" [...] within the State of California, {{and in the case of}} narrow-width lanes it is advisable to do so.|$|R

25|$|Mahjong {{has been}} an {{essential}} part of most local peoples' lives. After every day' s working, people gather their friends in their home or in the tea houses on the street to play Mahjong. On sunny days, local people like to play Mahjong <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> to enjoy the sunshine and also the time with friends. Almost every person plays Mahjong with money: rich people play with more money, and the poor people play with less money. In all, everyone is excited and interested in playing with money.|$|E
25|$|Several {{elements}} recur in {{the films}} series. You can note the main sponsor {{by looking at the}} villain's cars, the security cars, the police cars, the gang's car, and so on. Usually, Toyota has been the main sponsor of the film series, supplying the films with civilian cars parked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks,</b> Crowns as taxis, Toyota Cressida as police cars, Hiace as security vans and money transports, and so on. There have been exceptions, notably Olsenbandens aller siste kupp (The Olsen-Gangs very last coup) from 1982, which was sponsored by Datsun.|$|E
25|$|The Aladdin was {{scheduled}} to reopen on August 17, 2000, at 6:00p.m., with fireworks at 10:00p.m. The opening was delayed while the Clark County building inspector completed its fire safety testing. Another delay was caused by last-minute repairs to the casino surveillance system. This left thousands of Aladdin visitors leaving in disappointment, as well as opening night hotel guests wondering where they'd spend the night. Many high-rollers waited out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> {{in front of the}} Aladdin for hours. Most were unable to even get to their luggage, since the hotel had been locked down for testing. Aladdin employees tried to arrange alternate accommodations for the guests with Paris and Bellagio.|$|E

500|$|Born in Fort Smith, Arkansas on January 24, 1917, Sims {{was one of}} 12 children. The family soon {{relocated}} to Los Angeles, California, where he was raised. Describing his childhood, Sims said, [...] "It was just a whole big dancing family." [...] He learned to dance from his father, {{and said he was}} dancing as soon as he could walk. He began tap-dancing at the age of 3. He attributed some of his early love for tap dancing in particular to his mother, exasperated that he kept wearing out the toes of his shoes, putting steel taps on the shoes. Along with his brothers, Sims was dancing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> of Los Angeles from a young age. At the age of 14, peeping in the windows of a dance school got Sims arrested for loitering, but he was able to dance his way to freedom, convincing a judge that his reason for being on that street was legitimate.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Raymond Wilson {{published}} a book called Jenner of George Street: Sydney's Soul-Winning Sailor {{in an attempt to}} tell the story of Jenner's life accurately. Jenner's family had been finding it painful to have alternate accounts of Jenner's life circulating around the world, so they gave Wilson all the information he desired. Wilson wrote that Jenner was [...] "eccentric... the very antithesis of the 'wise', 'mighty', and 'noble'," [...] but that his life was therefore a good demonstration of 2 Corinthians 12:9, which states that God's [...] "power is made perfect in weakness." [...] Wilson wrote that Jenner's question of [...] "heaven or hell" [...] was very similar to that of Arthur Stace, another Australian street evangelist who wrote the word [...] "Eternity" [...] <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> so people would consider where they would be in eternity. Wilson called Jenner a battler and did not recommend that his readers emulate Jenner's evangelistic activities [...] "unless Divinely fitted in a similar way." [...] Wilson wrote that he [...] "travelled and corresponded widely to ascertain the facts of the story" [...] and that he personally verified the accuracy of the information by retrieving first-hand accounts from all of the major figures in Jenner's life. The people Wilson interviewed included Nancy Dixon; Ann and Angus Carruthers, Jenner's daughter and son-in-law; Murray Wilkes; Ian Boyden; Tas McCarthy; Peter Culver; Noel Stanton; and Mary Stares.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout {{the summer}} of 1950, as many as 200 men were {{involved}} in the final steps of completion of the 1950 Tacoma Narrows Bridge. [...] On July 24, workers from Roebling's Sons were involved in wrapping and caulking the suspender cable bands, and the railings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> were being completed. By August 22, the road deck was taking shape, as workers continued concrete pours for the roadway. Painting began that week, as eleven men worked the paint crew sandblasting and painting the stiffening truss. The bridge received its first coat of [...] "Narrows Green" [...] paint - a grayish-green hue (its predecessor had been painted the same color a decade before). By September 30, workers installed the finishing touches on the toll plazas, including installing sheetrock and plumbing. The midspan and tower hydraulic damping mechanisms were also installed, and workers began removing the catwalks, tower buttresses, and other working platforms.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2016, Verheyden-Hilliard of PCJF argued {{on behalf}} of the A.N.S.W.E.R. Coalition in a case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

The demonstrators specifically sought [...] "access to two key points along the Pennsylvania Avenue parade route — Freedom Plaza and the plaza in front of the newly opened Trump International Hotel at the Old Post Office Pavilion. The court ruled in favor of the government days before the inauguration of Donald Trump, upholding the National Park Service's rules on the location of inaugural parade protests. The court held that while the First Amendment requires the government to allow [...] "ample space for peaceful demonstrations," [...] it did not support A.N.S.W.E.R.'s [...] "claim of a right to displace spectator bleachers with its own demonstration at Freedom Plaza." ...|$|E
2500|$|Germans ordered {{registration}} of all Jews and a word [...] "Jude" [...] was stamped in their identity cards.

For example, Jews {{were forbidden to}} walk <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks,</b> use public transport, enter places of leisure, sports arenas, theaters, museums and libraries. On the street, Jews had to lift their hat to passing Germans. By the end of 1941 all Jews in German-occupied Poland, except the children, had to wear an identifying badge with a blue Star of David. Rabbis were humiliated in [...] "spectacles organised by the German soldiers and police" [...] who used their rifle butts [...] "to make these men dance in their praying shawls." [...] The Germans [...] "disappointed that Poles refused to collaborate", made little attempts {{to set up a}} collaborationist government in Poland, nevertheless, German tabloids printed in Polish routinely ran antisemitic articles that urged local people to adopt an attitude of indifference towards the Jews.|$|E
