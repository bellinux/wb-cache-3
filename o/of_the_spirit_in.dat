5|$|The {{religious}} movement {{believes in}} a moral progression through reincarnation after death: the transmigration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>in</b> {{a human body}} only reflects the degree of spiritual elevation. The reincarnated person has no recollection of the past lives, and can again make progress in his spiritual course that allows him, at the end, to reach the divine state which releases him from the cycle of reincarnation. The harm caused by disease and by people {{is seen as a}} beneficial cure, as the pain can increase one's spiritual progress and thus contribute to one's salvation. The silent prayer is also considered as a way to connect the spirit to consciousness. Antoine, who suffered from disease and demonstrated asceticism and dedication throughout his life, is regarded by followers as a role model to attain salvation.|$|E

25|$|Although spiritual {{direction}} {{is not necessarily}} connected with the sacrament, the sacrament of penance has throughout the centuries been one of its main settings, enabling the Christian to become sensitive to God's presence, deepen the personal relationship with Christ, and attend to the action <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> <b>in</b> one's life. In the 20th century, during the Second Vatican Council, new approaches were taken in the presentation of this sacrament, {{taking into account the}} concern of scrupulosity, or the exaggerated obsessive concern for detail. This further distinguished the role of penance from forms of psychotherapy.|$|E

25|$|While fascism {{accepted}} {{the importance of}} material wealth and power, it condemned materialism which identified as being present in both communism and capitalism and criticized materialism for lacking acknowledgement of the role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit.</b> <b>In</b> particular, fascists criticized capitalism not because of its competitive nature nor support of private property, which fascists supported—but due to its materialism, individualism, alleged bourgeois decadence and alleged indifference to the nation. Fascism denounced Marxism for its advocacy of materialist internationalist class identity, which fascists regarded as an attack upon the emotional and spiritual bonds {{of the nation and}} a threat to the achievement of genuine national solidarity.|$|E
25|$|The Charismatic {{element of}} the Church is seen as being evident {{today as it was}} in the early days of Christianity. Some Catholic Charismatic {{communities}} conduct healing services, gospel power services, outreaches and evangelizations where the presence of the Holy Spirit is believed to be felt, and healings and miracles are said to take place. The mission of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal is to educate believers into the totality of the declaration of the gospels. This is done by a personal relationship with Jesus Christ; a one-to-one relationship with Jesus is seen as a possibility by the Charismatic. He is encouraged to talk to Jesus directly and search for what The Lord is saying so that his life will be one with Him; to walk in the Fruit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> <b>in</b> , this is what the Charismatic understands by giving their life to Jesus. Conscience is seen as an alternative voice of Jesus Christ.|$|E

500|$|Nasser {{was greatly}} {{influenced}} by Egyptian nationalism, as espoused by politician Mustafa Kamel, poet Ahmed Shawqi, and his anti-colonialist instructor at the Royal Military Academy, Aziz al-Masri, to whom Nasser expressed his gratitude in a 1961 newspaper interview. He was especially influenced by Egyptian writer Tawfiq al-Hakim's novel Return <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit,</b> <b>in</b> which al-Hakim wrote that the Egyptian people were only {{in need of a}} [...] "man in whom all their feelings and desires will be represented, and who will be for them a symbol of their objective".

500|$|Previously {{enclosed}} {{and used}} as a vestry and then an organ chamber, the south porch became a chapel in 1903. In 1988, the side chapel was remodelled and dedicated as the Chapel of the Holy Spirit. The parish and the Bicentennial Council of New South Wales funded the redesign which saw {{the removal of the}} infilling from between the columns of the portico and its replacement with stained glass. The award-winning [...] "Creation Window", designed by Australian artist David Wright, spreads across the three walls and represents the interaction of earth, air, fire and water, symbolic of the action <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> <b>in</b> creation, in life and in rebirth in Christ.

500|$|The {{theology}} of the gospel is strongly influenced by Jewish–Christian wisdom teaching. The Holy Spirit is represented {{as a manifestation of}} Divine Wisdom who is called [...] "Mother". The feminine aspect of the Spirit is an indication of Semitic influence on the language of the gospel. The Spirit takes Jesus to Mount Tabor by a single hair, echoing Old Testament themes in the stories of Ezekiel (Ezk.8.3) and Habbakuk (Dan.14.36 LXX). The gospel emphasizes the fulfillment of the prophecy of Isaiah11.2 in Jesus' baptism, but also adopts elements of Jewish Wisdom theology. The Spirit has been gathered in one place at the moment of Jesus' baptism, so that he has become the only Son <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> <b>in</b> which he has found eternal [...] "rest" [...] and reigns forever. The [...] "seek–find" [...] and [...] "rule–rest" [...] language also comes from Jewish Wisdom tradition as stages on the way to salvation during which the believer is encouraged to emulate divine Wisdom.|$|E

The UPCI also maintains the teaching of gender roles, including a belief that women should not cut their hair (1 Corinthians 11:3-15) or wear pants. Inward and outward modesty applies to women and men alike, though UPCI men have fewer dress codes than their female counterparts. Members are discouraged from adorning themselves outwardly with cosmetics or jewelry, biblically defined as [...] "gold, or pearls, or costly array," [...] and should instead show their beauty by their actions (I Timothy 2:8-10).|$|E

2500|$|Pentecostals are continuationists, {{meaning they}} believe {{that all of the}} spiritual gifts, {{including}} the miraculous or [...] "sign gifts", found in , , , and [...] continue to operate within the Church in the present time. Pentecostals place the gifts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> <b>in</b> context with the fruit of the Spirit.

Spiritual gifts are received as a result of the baptism with the Holy Spirit. As gifts freely given by the Holy Spirit, they cannot be earned or merited, and they are not appropriate criteria with which to evaluate one's spiritual life or maturity. Pentecostals see in the biblical writings of Paul an emphasis on having both character and power, exercising the gifts in love.|$|E
