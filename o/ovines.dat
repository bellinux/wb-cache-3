To keep cells and tissues viable, they must be frozen quickly to prevent ice crystal formation. Thus, a large surface area is beneficial. Another limitation is the species being preserved. There have been difficulties using particular methods of cryoconservation with certain species. For example, artificial insemination is more difficult in sheep than cattle, goats, pigs, or horses due to posterior folds in the cervix of <b>ovines.</b> Cryopreservation of embryos is dependent on the species and the stage of development of the embryo. Pig embryos are the most difficult to freeze, thaw, and utilize produce live offspring due to their sensitivity to chilling and high lipid content.|$|E
500|$|Gradually, {{beginning}} in the 19th century, sheep production in the U.S. moved westward. Today, {{the vast majority of}} flocks reside on Western range lands. During this westward migration of the industry, competition between sheep (sometime called [...] "range maggots") and cattle operations grew more heated, eventually erupting into range wars. Other than simple competition for grazing and water rights, cattlemen believed that the secretions of the foot glands of sheep made cattle unwilling to graze on places where sheep had stepped. As sheep production centered on the U.S. western ranges, it became associated with other parts of Western culture, such as the rodeo. In modern America, a minor event in rodeos is mutton busting, in which children compete to see who can stay atop a sheep the longest before falling off. Another effect of the westward movement of sheep flocks in North America was the decline of wild species such as Bighorn sheep (O. canadesis). Most diseases of domestic sheep are transmittable to wild <b>ovines,</b> and such diseases, along with overgrazing and habitat loss, are named as primary factors in the plummeting numbers of wild sheep. Sheep production peaked in North America during the 1940s and 1950s at more than 55 million head.

40|$|Abstract Background Classically, {{progesterone}} {{has been}} thought to act {{only through the}} well-known genomic pathway involving hormone binding to nuclear receptors and subsequent modulation of gene expression. However, there is increasing evidence for rapid, non-genomic effects of progesterone {{in a variety of}} mammalian tissues and it is possible that a membrane PR (mPR) is causing these events. We recently isolated and characterized an <b>ovine</b> mPR referred to as mPR-alpha, distinct from the nuclear PR. Based on predicted structural analysis, the <b>ovine</b> mPR-alpha possesses seven transmembrane domains typical of G protein-coupled receptors. Despite the homology to other reported mPRs, information pertaining to the steroid binding characteristics of the <b>ovine</b> mPR-alpha was lacking. Additionally, the <b>ovine</b> mPR-alpha transcript has been identified in the hypothalamus, pituitary, uterus, ovary and corpus luteum, yet changes in expression of the <b>ovine</b> mPR-alpha in these tissues were not known. Consequently, the purpose of this work was to determine the steroid binding characteristics of the <b>ovine</b> mPR-alpha and to investigate possible changes in expression of the <b>ovine</b> mPR-alpha in reproductive tissues throughout the estrous cycle. Methods Binding studies were performed using crude membrane fractions from CHO cells expressing the mPR-alpha. Using quantitative Real-time PCR we determined the expression pattern of mRNA for the <b>ovine</b> mPR-alpha during the <b>ovine</b> estrous cycle in tissues known to express the mPR-alpha. Jugular blood samples were also collected and analyzed for serum concentrations of P 4 to ensure ewes were at the appropriate stage of their cycle.

Small animals have been the dominant transfusion model but have associated limitations. This study aimed to develop a comprehensive large animal (<b>ovine)</b> model of transfusion encompassing: blood collection, processing and storage, compatibility testing right through to post-transfusion outcomes. Materials and methods: Two units of blood were collected from each of 12 adult male Merino sheep and processed into 24 ovine-packed red blood cell (PRBC) units. Baseline haematological parameters of <b>ovine</b> blood and PRBC cells were analysed. Biochemical changes in <b>ovine</b> PRBCs were characterized during the 42 -day storage period. Immunological compatibility of the blood was confirmed with sera from potential recipient sheep, using a saline and albumin agglutination cross-match. Following confirmation of compatibility, each recipient sheep (n = 12) was transfused with two units of <b>ovine</b> PRBC. Results: Procedures for collecting, processing, cross-matching and transfusing <b>ovine</b> blood were established. Although <b>ovine</b> red blood cells are smaller and higher in number, their mean cell haemoglobin concentration is similar to human red blood cells. <b>Ovine</b> PRBC showed improved storage properties in saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol (SAG-M) compared with previous human PRBC studies.

Like humanCFTR, <b>ovine</b> CFTR formed a weakly inwardly rectifying Cl− channel regulated by PKA-dependentphosphorylation, inhibited by the open-channel blocker glibenclamide. However, for threereasons, <b>ovine</b> CFTR was noticeably more active than human CFTR. First, single-channelconductance was increased. Second, open probability was augmented because the frequencyand duration of channel openings were increased. Third, with enhanced affinity and efficacy, ATPmore strongly stimulated <b>ovine</b> CFTR channel gating. Consistent with these data, the CFTRmodulator phloxine B failed to potentiate <b>ovine</b> CFTR Cl− currents. Similar to its impacton human CFTR, the F 508 del mutation caused a temperature-sensitive folding defect, whichdisrupted <b>ovine</b> CFTR protein processing and reduced membrane stability. However, the F 508 delmutation had reduced impact on <b>ovine</b> CFTR channel gating in contrast to its marked effects on human CFTR.

40|$|Abstract Background The <b>ovine</b> Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) harbors genes {{involved}} in overall resistance/susceptibility {{of the host}} to infectious diseases. Compared to human and mouse, the <b>ovine</b> MHC is interrupted by {{a large piece of}} autosome insertion via a hypothetical chromosome inversion that constitutes ~ 25 % of <b>ovine</b> chromosome 20. The evolutionary consequence of such an inversion and an insertion (inversion/insertion) in relation to MHC function remains unknown. We previously constructed a BAC clone physical map for the <b>ovine</b> MHC exclusive of the insertion region. Here we report the construction of a high-density physical map covering the autosome insertion in order to address the question of what the inversion/insertion had to do with ruminants during the MHC evolution. Results A total of 119 pairs of comparative bovine oligo primers were utilized to screen an <b>ovine</b> BAC library for positive clones and the orders and overlapping relationships of the identified clones were determined by DNA fingerprinting, BAC-end sequencing, and sequence-specific PCR. A total of 368 positive BAC clones were identified and 108 of the effective clones were ordered into an overlapping BAC contig to cover the consensus region between <b>ovine</b> MHC class IIa and IIb. Therefore, a continuous physical map covering the entire <b>ovine</b> autosome inversion/insertion region was successfully constructed. The map confirmed the bovine sequence assembly for the same homologous region. The DNA sequences of 185 BAC-ends have been deposited into NCBI database with the access numbers HR 309252 through HR 309068, corresponding to dbGSS ID 30164010 through 30163826.

The renal artery always appeared single, and before reaching the renal hilus, it bifurcated into sectorial dorsal and ventral arteries, giving rise to the segmentary arteries which varied from 6 to 10 in number in the right kidney and 7 to 11 in the left kidney. These vessels vascularized independent areas in each renal sector, the renal arterial segments, separated by non-vascularized planes. Bilateral symmetry of the arterial segmentation was found in 13. 33 % of cases. In accordance with the arterial characterization, the realization of setoriectomy and segmentectomy on the kidneys of Santa Ines <b>ovines</b> is therefore deemed possible...|$|E

An {{analysis}} of the deaths of "fatty-tailed sheep" bred at the Nioka Research Centre {{has shown that the}} deaths of animals between January 89 and 31 st December 1993, were due to the wormy diarrhoea (43. 8 %), the new-born deaths (19. 4 %) and to unknown causes (14. 28 %).

40|$|The reverse transcription-polymerase chain {{reaction}} (RT-PCR) {{was used to}} determine the patterns of expression for several growth factor ligand and receptor genes during <b>ovine</b> preimplantation development. Transcripts for insulin-like growth factor (IGF) -I, IGF-II, and the receptors for insulin and IGF-I were detected throughout <b>ovine</b> preimplantation development from the 1 -cell to the blastocyst stage. Transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha) transcripts were also detected throughout <b>ovine</b> preimplantation development. The mRNAs encoding basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were detected in all stages of the <b>ovine</b> preimplantation embryo, although the relative abundance of this transcript consistently decreased from the 1 -cell to the blastocyst stage, suggesting that it may represent a maternal transcript in early sheep embryos. Transcripts encoding <b>ovine</b> trophoblast protein (oTP) were detected only within blastocyst-stage embryos. Primary <b>ovine</b> oviduct cell cultures express the transcripts for IGF-II, IGF-I, TGF alpha, bFGF, TGF beta 1, and the receptors for insulin and IGF-I, suggesting that paracrine growth factor circuits may exist between the oviduct epithelium and the early <b>ovine</b> embryo. Transcripts for insulin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and nerve growth factor (NGF) were not detected in any stage of the <b>ovine</b> preimplantation embryo or within the oviduct cell preparations. The expression of growth factor transcripts very early in mammalian development would predict that these molecules fulfil a necessary role(s) in supporting the progression of early embryos through the preimplantation interval. Our future efforts will be directed to understanding the nature of these putative regulatory pathways...|$|R
40|$|The {{manufacturing}} processes of {{royal demolition explosive}} (RDX), or hexahydro- 1, 3, 5 -trinitro- 1, 3, 5 -triazine, have resulted in serious water contamination. As a potential carcinogen, RDX can cause {{a broad range of}} harmful effects to humans and animals. The <b>ovine</b> rumen is capable of rapid degradation of nitroaromatic compounds, including RDX. While ruminal RDX-degrading bacteria have been identified, the genes and pathways responsible for RDX degradation in the rumen have yet to be characterized. In this study, we characterized the metabolic potential of the <b>ovine</b> rumen using metagenomic approaches. Sequences homologous to at least five RDX-degrading genes cloned from environmental samples (diaA, xenA, xenB, xplA, and xplB) were present in the <b>ovine</b> rumen microbiome. Among them, diaA was the most abundant, likely reflective of the predominance of the genus Clostridium in the <b>ovine</b> rumen. At least ten genera known to harbor RDX-degrading microorganisms were detectable. Metagenomic sequences were also annotated using public databases, such as Pfam, COG, and KEGG. Five of the six Pfam protein families known to be responsible for RDX degradation in environmental samples were identified in the <b>ovine</b> rumen. However, increased substrate availability did not appear to enhance the proliferation of RDX-degrading bacteria and alter the microbial composition of the <b>ovine</b> rumen. This implies that the RDX-degrading capacity of the <b>ovine</b> rumen microbiome is likely regulated at the transcription level. Our results provide metagenomic insights into the RDX-degrading potential of the <b>ovine</b> rumen, and they will facilitate the development o...|$|R
40|$|A {{combined}} {{experimental and}} analytical approach {{was taken to}} understand the vibrational characteristics of the <b>ovine</b> head, as a framework to use vibrational measurements to monitor changes in intracranial pressure. Modal analysis was performed on excised <b>ovine</b> heads to establish the spatial and spectral behavior of the head {{as a function of}} the presence of the soft extracranial and intracranial tissues and boundary conditions. Measurements of <b>ovine</b> cranial bone thickness, density, moisture content, and modulus of elasticity provided material property values for incorporation into analytical models of the <b>ovine</b> skull. Simplified spherical models were used in a parametric analysis to determine the sensitivity of the skull to changes in material properties and geometry. A detailed finite element model of the <b>ovine</b> skull was obtained by digitizing the cranial cavity of an <b>ovine</b> skull in 3 D. Isotropic, homogeneous material properties which were measured for <b>ovine</b> cranial bone were incorporated into the detailed geometric model. The calculated modal shapes from the finite element model were validated by high correlations to experimental modal shapes as calculated by the Modal Assurance Criterion. While the finite element model described the vibrational behavior of the head adequately, it was relatively insensitive to increases in internal pressure of 50 cm H 2 O. ...|$|R
