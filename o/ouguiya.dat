50|$|In 1973, ⅕ (1 khoums), 1, 5, 10 and 20 <b>ouguiya</b> coins were introduced. This was {{the only}} year that the khoums was minted, as the <b>ouguiya</b> was worth five CFA Francs a khoums was the {{equivalent}} of the franc (which had no subdivision). The most recent issues were in 2003 (1 <b>ouguiya)</b> and 2004 (other denominations). Coins are minted at the Kremnica mint in Slovakia. The coinage slightly changed in 2009, with a reduced 1 <b>ouguiya</b> in plated composition and a bi-metallic 20 <b>ouguiya</b> issued. A bi-metallic 50 <b>ouguiya</b> was issued December 2010.|$|E
5000|$|Discovered in 2001, Chinguetti {{has proven}} {{reserves}} of about [...] of oil. At {{the end of}} December 2005, authorities estimated that in 2006, the oil profits would be 47 billion <b>ouguiyas</b> (about US$180 million) and represent {{a quarter of the}} state budget, according to RFI.|$|R
50|$|The first Sahrawi pesetas were minted in 1990, {{but they}} were not adopted as the {{national}} coin of Western Sahara until 1997. As this territory is mostly controlled by Morocco, the circulating currency {{in that part of the}} country is the Moroccan dirham, with Algerian dinars and Mauritanian <b>ouguiyas</b> circulating alongside the Sahrawi peseta in the Sahrawi refugee camps and the SADR-controlled part of Western Sahara.|$|R
50|$|In November 2008, Waghef {{and four}} others {{were charged with}} {{intentionally}} bankrupting Air Mauritanie while Waghef was its Director-General. In early December, bail for Waghef and his co-defendants was set at 100 million ouguiyas; this was reportedly {{the highest level of}} bail ever set by a court in Mauritania. Waghef was also charged with corruption in a case involving spoiled food; the bail set in that case was five million <b>ouguiyas.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The khoums (Arabic خمس, [...] "fifth") is the subdivisory {{unit of the}} Mauritanian {{monetary}} system, the <b>Ouguiya.</b> Five khoums make an <b>ouguiya,</b> hence one khoums can {{be expressed}} as 0.2 <b>ouguiya.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The <b>ouguiya</b> was {{introduced}} in 1973, replacing the CFA franc {{at a rate of}} 1 <b>ouguiya</b> = 5 francs.The name [...] "Ouguiya" [...] (أوقية) is the Hassaniya Arabic pronunciation of [...] "Awqiyyah" [...] (أُوقِية), meaning [...] "ounce".|$|E
40|$|Based on two {{national}} household surveys, {{carried out in}} 1990 and 1995 _ 96, a test of stochastic dominance allows to apprehend spacial poverty differences in Mauritania. The results show a relative robustness as for the classification of the social states in terms of poverty of three principal groups. By order descending of poverty, the latter are:(i) the rural sector of the River and the South & South_East;(ii) urban zones of the River and the South & South_East, {{as well as the}} rural Center_North; (iii) Nouakchott and cities of Center_North. This conclusion was obtained with a poverty ligne of 40 402 <b>ouguiyas</b> per capita and per annum - determined by the approach {{of the cost of the}} basic needs -, and is independent of the taking into account of a scale factor of the households different from the unit. In addition, the regression of rural and urban poverty in Mauritania between 1990 and 1996 shows that, for additive measurements, it is stronger in relative terms in the urban sector, compared to the rural sector, whereas the reverse prevails in absolute terms. Moreover, the regional structure of poverty is only changed in rural sector, the area of the River being impoverished, relative at the other rural zones. On the other hand, the relative importance of poverty in the secondary cities is always highest compared to Nouakchott. Such results would tend to show the absence of antagonism between the policies of adjustment and the reduction of poverty and, at the same time, the advisability of focusing the actions in direction of the rural sector in order to fight the latter most effectively.

5000|$|The <b>ouguiya</b> (sign: UM; أوقية; {{currency}} code: MRO), also spelled [...] "ougiya", is {{the currency}} of Mauritania. Each <b>ouguiya</b> constitutes five khoums (singular and plural in English, خمس, meaning [...] "one fifth"). As such {{it is one of}} two circulating currencies, along with the Malagasy ariary, whose division units are not based on a power of ten.|$|E

50|$|In 1973, Mauritania {{replaced}} the CFA franc with the <b>ouguiya</b> {{at a rate}} of 1 <b>ouguiya</b> = 5 francs. Mali readopted the CFA franc in 1984, {{at a rate of}} 1 CFA franc = 2 Malian francs. The former Portuguese colony of Guinea-Bissau adopted the CFA franc in 1997, replacing the Guinea-Bissau peso at a rate of 1 CFA franc = 65 pesos.|$|E
5000|$|Mauritanian law prohibits adult sexual {{relations}} with a child, with penalties of six months {{to two years in}} prison and a 120,000 to 180,000 <b>ouguiya</b> (US$410 to $620) fine. The possession of child pornography is also illegal, with penalties of two months to one year in prison and a 160,000 to 300,000 <b>ouguiya</b> (US$550 to $1,034) fine. Commercial sexual exploitation of children is illegal and conviction carries penalties of two {{to five years in prison}} and a fine of 200,000 to 2 million <b>ouguiya</b> (US$690 to $6,900). In some instances, men from the Middle East contracted [...] "temporary marriages" [...] as a means to traffic and exploit young Mauritanian girls and women in the Middle East.|$|E

50|$|The nationally {{mandated}} minimum {{monthly wage}} for adults, {{which was not}} enforced, was $77 (21,000 <b>ouguiya),</b> which did not provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family.|$|E
50|$|Mauritania and Madagascar {{theoretically}} retain currencies with units whose {{values are}} in the ratio five to one: the Mauritanian <b>ouguiya</b> (MRO) is equivalent to five khoums, and the Malagasy ariary (MGA) to five iraimbilanja.|$|E
50|$|When the <b>ouguiya</b> {{was adapted}} in 1973, it {{replaced}} the CFA franc as 5 francs to the <b>ouguiya,</b> thus a khoums was {{equal to the}} franc. As the franc had no subdivisional unit, all wealths in francs could be converted to ouigiya with no rounding. On the khoums coin (minted in Kremnica Mint, Slovakia), the obverse is in Arabic with {{the date of the}} Islamic calendar and the reverse in French in the Gregorian calendar with national arms on each side, identical to all other Mauritanian coins. However, on the Arabic side, instead of a number like on the other coins, the word خمس is used.|$|E
50|$|Within Nouakchott, the nation's capital, most coins are in fine to {{very fine}} condition; {{banknotes}} of 100 and 200 <b>ouguiya</b> {{tend to be}} in poor to fair condition, larger denominations are in fine to extremely fine condition.|$|E
50|$|The only current non-decimal {{currencies}} are the Malagasy ariary (equal to five iraimbilanja) and the Mauritanian <b>ouguiya</b> (equal to five khoums), {{though in}} practice both {{just have one}} currency unit and no sub-unit because khoums and iraimbilanja are no longer minted.|$|E
50|$|There were no {{government}} restrictions on {{access to the}} Internet or reports that the government monitored email or Internet chat rooms in 2010. Individuals and groups could engage in the peaceful expression of views via the Internet, including by e-mail. There is a law prohibiting child pornography with penalties of two months to one year imprisonment and a 160,000 to 300,000 <b>ouguiya</b> ($550 to $1,034) fine.|$|E
5000|$|In 1973, {{notes were}} {{issued by the}} Central Bank of Mauritania (Banque Centrale de Mauritanie) in {{denominations}} of 100, 200 and 1,000 <b>ouguiya.</b> In 1974, a second series of notes was issued in the same denominations, with 500 <b>ouguiya</b> notes added in 1979. Banknotes have been printed by Giesecke & Devrient in Munich, starting with the second issue. New banknotes were introduced in 2004. These notes have completely new fronts and the vignettes on the backs have been redesigned to accommodate the reduction in size. The 2,000-ouguiya denomination is entirely new. All but the 100- and 200-ouguiya notes have the denomination expressed in Arabic numerals in a holographic patch at right front. The serial numbers for all denominations now appear horizontally at upper left and lower center, and vertically at far right, all formatted with a 2-character prefix, 7-digit serial number, and 1-character suffix. An entirely new 5,000-ouguiya denomination dated 28.11.2009 was introduced on 8 August 2010, followed by a redesigned 2,000-ouguiya note dated 28.11.2011 issued on 1 February 2012.|$|E
50|$|Today {{only two}} {{countries}} in the world use non-decimal currencies. Both of these countries are in Africa. These are Mauritania (1 <b>ouguiya</b> = 5 khoums) and Madagascar (1 ariary = 5 iraimbilanja). However these are only theoretically non-decimal, as in both cases the value of the main unit is so low that the sub-unit is too small to be of any practical use and coins of the sub-unit are no longer used.|$|E
5000|$|The ariary (sign: Ar; ISO 4217 code MGA) is the {{currency}} of Madagascar. It is subdivided into 5 iraimbilanja {{and is one of}} only two non-decimal currencies currently circulating (the other is the Mauritanian <b>ouguiya).</b> The names ariary and iraimbilanja derive from the pre-colonial currency, with ariary being the name for a silver dollar. Iraimbilanja means literally [...] "one iron weight" [...] and was the name of an old coin worth [...] of an ariary.|$|E
50|$|On 13 April 2011, the {{government}} tried its first case under the antislavery law. The defendants were acquitted the same day. On 20 November, the first conviction for slavery was {{obtained in the}} case of two enslaved youths. The master received a sentence of two years' imprisonment, and his family members received suspended sentences. They were also ordered to pay a fine of 1.35 million <b>ouguiya</b> (US$4,655). The mother of the two youths received a one-year suspended sentence.|$|E
50|$|Poorly {{educated and}} trained judges were {{susceptible}} in 2011 to social, financial, and tribal pressures that limited judicial fairness. On 15 May, three juveniles received the death penalty, {{in violation of}} national legislation and ratified international conventions, for {{their role in the}} death of another minor. Observers suggested that the court was influenced by tribal and social factors. On 12 December, the sentences were reduced to 12 years in prison and a combined 1.2 million <b>ouguiya</b> (US$4,130) fine.|$|E
5000|$|Mauritania and Madagascar are {{the only}} {{remaining}} countries that do not use the decimal system; instead, the Mauritanian <b>ouguiya</b> is in theory divided into 5 khoums, while the Malagasy ariary is theoretically divided into 5 iraimbilanja. In these countries, words like dollar or pound [...] "were simply names for given weights of gold." [...] Due to inflation khoums and iraimbilanja have in practice fallen into disuse. (See non-decimal currencies for other historic currencies with non-decimal divisions.) ...|$|E
50|$|Under Shari'a, {{as applied}} in Mauritania, consensual {{same-sex}} sexual activity between men is punishable by death if witnessed by four individuals, and such activity between women is punishable by {{three months to}} two years in prison and a 5,000 to 60,000 <b>ouguiya</b> (US$17 to $207) fine. There were no criminal prosecutions during the year. There was no evidence of societal violence, societal discrimination, or systematic government discrimination based on sexual orientation. There were no organizations advocating for sexual orientation or gender-identity rights, but there were no legal impediments to the operation of such groups.|$|E
50|$|Female genital {{mutilation}} (FGM) was practiced in 2011 by all {{ethnic groups and}} performed on young girls, often on the seventh day after birth and almost always {{before the age of}} six months. The child protection Penal Code states that any act or attempt to damage a female child's sexual organs is punishable by imprisonment and a 120,000 to 300,000 <b>ouguiya</b> (US$410 to $1,034) penalty. The most recent statistics on FGM indicated a decrease in incidence from 71 percent in 2001 to 65 percent in 2007, mainly due to a decline in the practice among urban dwellers. Infibulation, the most severe form of excision, was not practiced.|$|E
50|$|In 1968 Abdallahi {{returned}} to Mauritania to become Director of the Plan. He {{worked on the}} Second Plan for Economic and Social Development. In 1971, he was appointed as Minister of Planning and Industrial Development in September 1971 by the first post-independence President, Moktar Ould Daddah. During the 1970s he served {{in a series of}} positions in the government, including that of Minister of State for the National Economy in 1975 and Minister of Planning and Mines in 1976. As Minister of Planning and Mines he was involved in the nationalization of the iron mines and the introduction of the <b>ouguiya</b> as the nation's currency.|$|E
5000|$|On January 2, 2014, Mkhaitir {{was arrested}} in {{his home in the}} city of Nouadhibou, two days after he wrote an article titled “Religion, Religiosity and Craftsmen” on the website Aqlame {{critical}} of the prophet Muhammad's treatment of non-Arabs relating to the caste system in Mauritania. Clerics issued a fatwa against him and demanded he be executed. [...] A businessman offered a 10,000 <b>ouguiya</b> reward for his death. [...] He was charged with apostasy under Article 306 of the Mauritanian criminal code, and subsequently sentenced to death by firing squad. [...] Mkhaitir would be the first person executed in Mauritania since 1987. [...] Despite repenting and saying shahada, the supreme court upheld his death sentence.|$|E
50|$|In theory, two {{countries}} currently use non-decimal currency: Mauritania (1 <b>ouguiya</b> = 5 khoums) and Madagascar (1 ariary = 5 iraimbilanja). In practice, however, {{the value of}} the main unit in each case is so low (less than 1/1000 of a United States dollar) that the sub-unit is not of any practical use and is rarely seen in circulation. In the case of the iraimbilanja, this is a carryover of the Madagascar's previous currency, the Malagasy franc, which had the ariary as a super unit worth 5 francs, and iraimbilanja was an alternate term for the franc. The last major countries to use non-decimal currencies in practice were the United Kingdom (until 1971), Ireland (1971), Malta (1972) and Nigeria (1973).|$|E
50|$|To take {{advantage}} of the country's sizable iron ore deposits in Zouérat, the new government built a 675-km railway and a mining port. Production began in 1963. The mines were operated by a foreign owned consortium that paid its approximately 3,000 expatriate workers handsomely - their salaries accounted for two-thirds of the country's entire wages bill. When the Mauritanian miners went on a two-month strike in the late 1960s the army intervened and eight miners were killed. Left-wing opposition to the government mounted and some miners formed a clandestine Marxist union in 1973. President Ould Daddah survived the challenge from left-wing opponents by nationalising the company in 1974 and withdrawing from the franc zone, substituting the <b>ouguiya</b> for the CFA.|$|E
50|$|Between 16 March and 19 March 2009 {{and again}} on 25 June 2009 the news Web site Taqadoumy was blocked. On 26 February 2010, Hanevy Ould Dehah, {{director}} of Taqadoumy, received a presidential pardon after being detained since December 2009 despite having served his sentence for crimes against Islam and paying all imposed fines and legal fees. Dehah, who was originally arrested in June 2009 on charges of defamation of presidential candidate Ibrahima Sarr for publishing an article stating that Sarr bought a house with campaign money from General Aziz. Dehah, was sentenced in August 2009 to six months in prison and fined 30,000 <b>ouguiya</b> ($111) for committing acts contrary to Islam and decency. The sentencing judge accused Dehah of creating a space allowing individuals to express anti-Islamic and indecent views, based on a female reader's comments made on the Taqadoumy site calling for increased sexual freedom.|$|E
