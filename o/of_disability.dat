40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the following: (i) associations among children’s prior contact with people with disabilities and the three dimensions of children’s attitudes towards people with disabilities: children’s understanding of and their feelings about people with disabilities and their behavioral intentions to make inclusion decisions; (ii) the relation between children’s behavioral intentions to make inclusion decisions and the demands of activity contexts and the types of disabilities; and (iii) the association between parents’ attitudes and children’s attitudes. Participants included 94 typically developing four- and five-year-old preschoolers. Children’s understanding <b>of</b> <b>disabilities</b> and their prior contact with people with disabilities were found to be positively related to their feelings about people with disabilities; children’s understanding <b>of</b> <b>disabilities</b> was a significant moderator of the relation between their behavioral intentions and activity contexts or types <b>of</b> <b>disabilities.</b> The hypothesized association between parents’ attitudes and children’s attitudes was not significant. Preschoolers may benefit from having more regular contact with people with disabilities to develop positive feelings towards their peers with disabilities, which is also related to their understanding <b>of</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Children’s behavioral intentions to make inclusion decisions need to be understood in relation to their understanding <b>of</b> <b>disabilities,</b> the demand <b>of</b> activity contexts, and types <b>of</b> <b>disabilities...</b>|$|R

5|$|Relapsing-remitting MS is {{characterized}} by unpredictable relapses followed by periods of months to years of relative quiet (remission) with no new signs of disease activity. Deficits that occur during attacks may either resolve or leave problems, the latter in about 40% of attacks and being more common the longer a person has had the disease. This describes the initial course of 80% of individuals with MS. When deficits always resolve between attacks, this is {{sometimes referred to as}} benign MS, although people will still build up some degree <b>of</b> <b>disability</b> in the long term. On the other hand, the term malignant multiple sclerosis is used to describe people with MS having reached significant level <b>of</b> <b>disability</b> in a short period. The relapsing-remitting subtype usually begins with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). In CIS, a person has an attack suggestive of demyelination, but does not fulfill the criteria for multiple sclerosis. 30 to 70% of persons experiencing CIS later develop MS.|$|E

40|$|The {{context in}} which ageing is {{occurring}} in Latin America and the Caribbean countries raises questions about future trajectories in the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>disabilities</b> by age.

The {{aim of this study}} is to analyse the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>disabilities</b> among the individuals 60 years and over in Buenos Aires and to evaluate the differences between groups with different educational levels. The data used come from the study "Health, Welfare and Aging"-SABE (Spanish acronym) - for Buenos Aires. Based on this information, we estimate the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>disabilities</b> by level <b>of</b> education and we analyse the effects of different risk factors on the likelihood <b>of</b> experiencing <b>disability</b> among individuals with different levels of education. The results suggest that educational level acts as a major protector against the risk <b>of</b> experiencing <b>disabilities</b> in ADL and IADL and the relationship would be partially mediated by health profiles of the individuals...|$|R

5|$|A {{person with}} MS can have almost any {{neurological}} symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems {{being the most}} common. The specific symptoms {{are determined by the}} locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation such as tingling, pins and needles or numbness, muscle weakness, blurred vision, very pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain, and bladder and bowel difficulties, among others. Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common. Uhthoff's phenomenon, a worsening of symptoms due to exposure to higher than usual temperatures, and Lhermitte's sign, an electrical sensation that runs down the back when bending the neck, are particularly characteristic of MS. The main measure <b>of</b> <b>disability</b> and severity is the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), with other measures such as the multiple sclerosis functional composite being increasingly used in research.|$|E

5|$|Motor symptoms, if not treated, advance aggressively in {{the early}} stages of the disease and more slowly later. Untreated, {{individuals}} are expected to lose independent ambulation after an average of eight years and be bedridden after ten years. However, it is uncommon to find untreated people nowadays. Medication has improved the prognosis of motor symptoms, while at the same time it is a new source <b>of</b> <b>disability,</b> because of the undesired effects of levodopa after years of use. In people taking levodopa, the progression time of symptoms to a stage of high dependency from caregivers may be over 15 years. However, it is hard to predict what course the disease will take for a given individual. Age is the best predictor of disease progression. The rate of motor decline is greater in those with less impairment at the time of diagnosis, while cognitive impairment is more frequent in those who are over 70 years of age at symptom onset.|$|E

5|$|Schizophrenia is a {{major cause}} <b>of</b> <b>disability,</b> with active {{psychosis}} ranked as the third-most-disabling condition after quadriplegia and dementia and ahead of paraplegia and blindness. Approximately three-fourths of people with schizophrenia have ongoing disability with relapses and 16.7million people globally are deemed to have moderate or severe disability from the condition. Some people do recover completely and others function well in society. Most people with schizophrenia live independently with community support. About 85% are unemployed. Some evidence suggests that paranoid schizophrenia may have a better prospect than other types of schizophrenia for independent living and occupational functioning. In people with a first episode of psychosis a good long-term outcome occurs in 42%, an intermediate outcome in 35% and a poor outcome in 27%. Outcomes for schizophrenia appear better in the developing than the developed world. These conclusions, however, have been questioned.|$|E
