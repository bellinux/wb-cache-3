2500|$|It is {{a common}} misapprehension, {{cultivated}} by Betjeman himself, {{that he did not}} complete his degree because he failed to pass the compulsory holy scripture examination, known colloquially as [...] "Divvers", short for [...] "Divinity". In Hilary term 1928, Betjeman failed Divinity for the second time. He had to leave the university for the Trinity term to prepare for a retake of the exam; he was then allowed to return in October. Betjeman then wrote to the Secretary of the Tutorial Board at Magdalen, G. C. Lee, asking to be entered for the Pass School, a set of examinations taken on rare occasions by undergraduates who are deemed unlikely to achieve an honours degree. In Summoned by Bells Betjeman claims that his tutor, C. S.

2500|$|The station {{activated}} {{its current}} tower in Trafalgar, the tallest structure in Indiana at [...] above ground level, in 1957. [...] The transmitter facility is located farther south than Indianapolis' other major television stations due to Federal Communications Commission regulations {{that require a}} station's transmitter site be located no more than [...] from its city of license – in this case, Bloomington, which is [...] south of Indianapolis. WTTV only provided a grade B ("rimshot") signal to the city's northern suburbs {{and could not be}} seen at all in the far northern portions of the market. As a result, most of these areas <b>only</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> clear signal from channel 4 when cable television arrived in central Indiana in the late 1960s. Because of this rule, when WTTV regained the ABC affiliation, WLBC-TV in Muncie (channel 49, allocation now occupied by PBS member station WIPB) served as the de facto ABC affiliate for {{the northern part of the}} market.|$|E
2500|$|They formed good {{relations}} with the local Inuit who drew knowledgable maps of the region which showed that there was no seaway to the west from where they were, or any further south in the Gulf although there was a narrow strait to the north (Bellot Strait). Following the guidance of the Inuit they experimented with dog sledges and were able to cross the Boothia Peninsula. A small party led by James Ross, including Abernethy, explored northwards but were unable to locate Bellot Strait. Again James Ross chose Abernethy for a westward expedition starting on 17 May 1830, crossing the Boothia Peninsula and the sea ice of James Ross Strait to King William Island, reaching a point at the north of the island which Ross named after Abernethy. They went a way down the northwest coast of the island and then, 200 miles in a direct line from their ship, they returned on 13 June – after a journey of one month they looked like [...] "human skeletons". Abernethy was on another sledging expedition to the south confirming {{that there was no way}} out from the Gulf of Boothia in that direction. Only by September could Victory head north but they <b>only</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> few miles before they were frozen in again for the next winter.|$|E
