40|$|Abstract：The {{centrifugal}} <b>oil</b> <b>purifier</b> {{is used in}} ships for purifying {{the engine}} lubrication oil. The momentum needed for {{the rotation of the}} cylindrical chamber is obtained by jet injections. The dust particles in the oil are separated by the centrifugal forces moving to the inner wall of the rotating cylindrical chamber body. The dust particles are eliminated when the particles are adsorbed onto the surface of the inner wall of the chamber body. The flow characteristics and the physical behaviours of particles in this centrifugal <b>oil</b> <b>purifier</b> have been investigated numerically and the filtration efficiencies have been evaluated. For the calculations, a commercial code has been used and the SST k-ω turbulence model has been adopted. The MRF (Multiple Reference Frame) method has been introduced to consider the rotating effect of the flows. Under various variables, such as particle size, particle density and rotating speed, the filtration efficiencies have been evaluated. It has been verified that the filtration efficiency is increased with the increments of the particle size, the particle density and the rotating speed of the cylindrical chamber...|$|E
40|$|HIGEE (High Gravity Rotary Device) {{rotating}} <b>oil</b> <b>purifier</b> {{which consists}} of two parts: hydrocyclone separator and rotating packed bed (abbr. RPB) {{is considered to be}} capable of removing the solid particle contaminant, moisture and gas simultaneously. As the major unit of HIGEE, the RPB uses centrifugal force to intensify mass transfer. Because of the special structure of RPB, the hydraulic characteristics of the RPB are very important. In this study, the multiphase flow model in porous media of the RPB is presented, and the dynamical oil-water separation in the RPB is simulated using a commercial computational fluid dynamics code. The operating conditions and configuration on the hydraulic performance of the RPB are investigated. The results have indicated that the separation efficiency of HIGEE rotating <b>oil</b> <b>purifier</b> is predominantly affected by operating conditions and the configurations. The best inlet pressure is 0. 002 [*]MPa. When the liquid inlet is placed in the outside of the lower surface of RPB; oil outlet is placed in the upper surface, where it is near the rotation axis; and water outlet is placed {{in the middle of the}} RPB, where it is far away from the oil outlet, the separating efficiency is the best...|$|E

30|$|The use of zeolite (AlPO- 18 (AEI topology), < 500 nm and Na+-X (FAU topology), 60 nm) as <b>oil</b> <b>purifier</b> {{has been}} carried out in our group [9]. The basis of this {{approach}} is that nanozeolites with high surface area and hydrophilic behavior tend to adsorb oxidation products from the lubricant oil and hence produce oil with low oxidation products. Since then, the use of nanosized K+-LTL zeolite (< 400 nm) as eco-friendly antioxidant in soybean oil-based lubricant is reported [3]. The results showed that Linde Type L (LTL) zeolite effectively controls the content of acidic oxidation products in oil, and hence the oxidation process is significantly decelerated. The effect of zeolite nanoparticles in halting oil degradation is obvious in both mineral and soybean-based lubricants. However, the study on the chemical properties of zeolites in halting oil oxidation remains unclear.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Soft sensor is an {{effective}} tool to estimate industrial process variables which are hard to be measured online for the technical or economical reasons. The modeling methods of the sensor {{are related to the}} approximating precision and speed. A soft sensor model with rough set and Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LSSVM) is presented in the paper. The rough set is employed to compress the data for preprocessing, which can get rid of the multicollinearity and reduce the dimension of input variables for the model. To solve the nonlinear and multiple input characteristics of industrial process, the LSSVM is delivered for model regression. The model is applied for moisture content soft sensing of vacuum <b>oil</b> <b>purifier.</b> The result shows that the proposed method features high speed and precise approximation ability, which has better performance of generalization for tracking the trend of the moisture content variety during oil purification...|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 41 - 50 The lube oils in {{self-contained}} reservoirs for turbomachinery in hydrocarbon {{processing plants}} {{are subject to}} contamination and deterioration from airborne dust, component debris, system corrosion, heat, and water. Oil supplies associated with certain gas compression sealing systems are further exposed to potential dilution with lighter hydrocarbons, and gaseous dilutants such as H?S. Excess water and acquired hydrocarbon constituents which adversely influence the viscosity and other characteristics of turbomachinery lube oils must be removed periodically, if machinery distress is to be avoided. As part of a determined effort to maintain the reliability of critically important turbomachinery, a major petrochemical complex has implemented a lube oil quality assurance program. Vacuum distillation equipment is used for oil purification, and periodic analysis of 36 reservoirs is employed to quantify lube oil condition. A major refinery in the same geographic area is developing a program with similar goals. The relevant experience accrued at both facilities is described. What is required to have consistently good results and to obtain the maximum economic benefits is illustrated. This {{can be achieved by}} evaluating and selecting an appropriately designed vacuum <b>oil</b> <b>purifier</b> and following up by implementing a rigorous analysis program...|$|E

For the training of deck department personnel there is an array of bridge simulators, including a 360 degree model and a 270 degree model. Workshops are provided for ropework and other deck associated skills, and simulators are provided for GMDSS training and cargo work. Engine department trainees avail of a fully functional engine room, which includes diesel engines, <b>oil</b> <b>purifiers,</b> air compressors, sewage treatment plant, fresh water generators and other equipment found on board oceangoing vessels.

There is an extensive marine library on site, but with limited access.|$|R
50|$|The {{density is}} also an {{important}} parameter for fuel oils since marine fuels are purified before use to remove water and dirt from the <b>oil.</b> Since the <b>purifiers</b> use centrifugal force, the oil must have a density which is sufficiently different from water. Older purifiers work with a fuel having a maximum of 991 kg/m3; with modern purifiers it is also possible to purify oil with a density of 1010 kg/m3.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{homogenizer}} in {{fuel treatment}} of {{heavy fuel oil}} on board merchant vessel is arguable; it will reduce separation efficiency of fuel contaminants and fuel properties. Therefore this research analyses the effectiveness of homogenizer operated in Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) vessel, MT Bunga Kasturi Lima. The aim {{of this research is}} to compare operational effects on the application of homogenizer against those without the use of homogenizer. The common method for fuel treatment on board the vessel is by using purifier. The separation of impurities and water from heavy fuel oil is essential for good combustion. Actual measurement was captured on board for sludge production, fuel <b>oil</b> sampling for <b>purifier</b> efficiency and fuel properties analyses and main engine exhaust gas sampling while the vessel was sailing from Singapore to Port of Sikka, India and then to Cape Town, South Africa. The range of sludge production reduction is between 17 % to 23 % compared to without homogenizer in operation. Purifier efficiency gives a result between 63 % to 70 % reduction of Aluminum and Silicon for untreated fuel (without homogenizer) and 42 % to 50 % for homogenized fuel (with homogenizer). The saving calculated from the operational data such as valuable fuel oil and less handling fees for sludge disposal were used for Net Present Value (NPV) analysis. The negative NPV was obtained and showed that the installation of homogenizer did not provide economic advantages. Furthermore it could be concluded that the effect from bunker fuel type, homogenizer positioning on board fuel treatment, vessel fuel consumption and sea state condition gave various impact on the effectiveness of homogenizer...|$|R
