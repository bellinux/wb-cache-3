5|$|Representative peers were {{introduced}} in 1707, when the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland were united into the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Britain.</b> At the time, there were 168 English and 154 Scottish peers. The English peers feared that the House of Lords would be swamped by the Scottish element, and consequently {{the election of a}} small number of representative peers to represent Scotland was negotiated. A similar arrangement was adopted when the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Britain</b> and the Kingdom of Ireland merged into the United Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Britain</b> and Ireland in January 1801.|$|E

5|$|The Kingdom of England—which after 1535 {{included}} Wales—ceased being {{a separate}} sovereign state on 1 May 1707, when the Acts of Union {{put into effect}} the terms agreed in the Treaty of Union the previous year, resulting in a political union with the Kingdom of Scotland to create the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Britain.</b> In 1801, Great Britain was united with the Kingdom of Ireland through another Act of Union to become the United Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Britain</b> and Ireland.

5|$|By 50 BC Greek geographers {{were using}} {{equivalents}} of Prettanikē {{as a collective}} name for the British Isles.

Following the end of Roman rule in Britain, the island <b>of</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Britain</b> was left open to invasion by pagan, seafaring warriors such as Germanic-speaking Anglo-Saxons and Jutes from Continental Europe, who gained control in areas around the south east, and to Middle Irish-speaking people migrating from what is today Northern Ireland to the north <b>of</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Britain</b> (modern Scotland), founding Gaelic kingdoms such as Dál Riata and Alba, which would eventually subsume the native Brittonic and Pictish kingdoms and become Scotland.|$|E

5|$|Several other Privy Councils {{have advised}} the sovereign. England and Scotland once had {{separate}} Privy Councils (the Privy Council of England and Privy Council of Scotland). The Acts of Union 1707 united {{the two countries}} into the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Britain</b> and in 1708 the Parliament <b>of</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Britain</b> abolished the Privy Council of Scotland. Thereafter there was one Privy Council <b>of</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Britain</b> sitting in London. Ireland, on the other hand, continued to have a separate Privy Council even after the Act of Union 1800. The Privy Council of Ireland was abolished in 1922, when {{the southern part of}} Ireland separated from the United Kingdom; it was succeeded by the Privy Council of Northern Ireland, which became dormant after the suspension of the Parliament of Northern Ireland in 1972. No further appointments have been made since then, and only four appointees were still living as of May 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Kingdom of Scotland {{emerged as}} an {{independent}} sovereign state in the Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707. By inheritance in 1603, James VI, King of Scots, became King of England and King of Ireland, thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms. Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with the Kingdom of England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Britain.</b> The union also created a new Parliament <b>of</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Britain,</b> which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England. In 1801, Great Britain itself entered into a political union with the Kingdom of Ireland to create the United Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Britain</b> and Ireland.|$|E
