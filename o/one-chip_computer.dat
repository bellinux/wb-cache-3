40|$|Abstract With the {{infiltration}} of computer social field in recent years, {{the application of}} the <b>one-chip</b> <b>computer</b> is moving towards deepening constantly, drive tradition is it measure crescent benefit to upgrade day to control at the same time. The main anti- interference means difference within machine system carried on summary and elucidation to the hardware anti- interference and the software anti- interference from the single slice. The each part of CPUâ€™s reaction of interference signal from the single slice and measures of CPU anti- interference are concluded and summarized. Also a processing of breakdown to the system and the design of self-instauration procedure had been made expatiation and elaborate in detail...|$|E
40|$|Introduction In {{less than}} a generation, the {{performance}} of computing devices has improved by several orders of magnitude. At the same time, their price has dropped dramatically. Today, a complete <b>one-chip</b> <b>computer</b> may be purchased {{for less than the}} price of one hour of work. But the cost of software has not kept pace with falling hardware prices. From 1955 to the early 1990 's, the proportion of system development costs attributable to software rose from 10 % to 90 %. Today, the demand for software greatly exceeds supply. Studies show that demand may outstrip supply by as much as three-to-one. This mismatch is sometimes referred to as a software crisis. The reasons for this software crisis are not difficult to fathom. Hardware is massproduced; the economies of scale and mass production exert constant downward pressure on hardware prices. Falling hardware prices have driven a rapid growth of demand for software. But software is not mass-produced. It is still hand-crafted by a limited s...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: At present, {{microcontrollers}} {{have found}} a broad application in various electronic connections. The scope of the use is very extensive and we can find them in circuits for regulation, control, measurement, amusement, etc. In accordance with the type, these powerful microscopic components (with respect to their possibilities) contain in a single box processor, data and program memories, input and output ports, A/D and D/A converters, synchronous serial port, etc. All functions performed by this controller are controlled by the program which is inserted in the chip. The controlling program is made by the user himself and thus the functions performed by this integrated circuit are specified. The parameters of <b>one-chip</b> <b>computer,</b> where a single box contains processor, data and program memories, etc. in a single integrated circuit allow to use this microchip in connections which would be hardly realized by classic integrated circuits. Owing {{to the use of}} these fast microprocessor, the connections are realized with a minimum number of the other components. ...|$|E
40|$|The work {{describes}} microcontrollers Atmel AVR {{and compares}} {{those with an}} older developmental line of <b>one-chip</b> <b>computers</b> by the same maker. It also describes ways of programming these microcontrollers by the Assembly language and foremost by the Bascom language. The work presented also emphasizes various problems often encountered when using this programming language. Particular attention is given to counters, timers and the pulse-width modulation, which is connected to their use. Part of this project is also application illustrating the programme and the microcontroller...|$|R
