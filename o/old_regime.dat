5|$|Following Haraldr Guðrøðarson's takeover, {{the chronicle}} records that he then drove {{out all of}} the chiefs and nobles of the <b>old</b> <b>regime</b> who had been {{supporters}} of the deceased Haraldr Óláfsson, and then replaced them with men whom the latter had previously exiled.|$|E
5|$|An era in {{the history}} of California closed yesterday. The Del Valles of Camulos bade {{farewell}} to the homestead where they have lived in successive generations since Antonio del Valle. It was the passing of the <b>old</b> <b>regime.</b> They are said to be the last of the old Spanish families who held in unbroken succession to the ancestral acres.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, SAS {{announced}} {{that it was going to}} reduce its commission to travel agents from 9 to 5%. Braathens followed, reducing from 8 to 5% from 1 January 1998. However, to try to attract more business passengers, the airline retained the 8% commission on their international routes. At the same time, the Government of Norway abandoned its <b>old</b> <b>regime</b> of negotiating prices with the airlines for state-employed civil servants' flights. Instead, they introduced an annual tender for the routes. It was awarded to SAS, who also won all subsequent tenders. For Braathens SAFE, this meant that state-employed civil servants only flew on routes where SAS did not fly. The contract was worth NOK500 million for SAS.|$|E
50|$|This chapter {{highlights}} the <b>old</b> <b>regimes</b> in crisis, such as France, China, and Russia. These states set the precedent for <b>old</b> <b>regimes</b> in crisis {{and help to}} outline pre-revolutionary conditions and the leading causes. Skocpol’s states that revolutionary crisis are created when the <b>old</b> <b>regimes</b> fail to modernize with the evolving international situation (Skocpol 1979, 48). The reason that the <b>old</b> <b>regimes</b> were in crisis was because the upper classes could not defend against peasant rebellions on a local basis; therefore, they supervise society to maintain order (Skocpol 1979, 48). The landed upper class relied on the monarchical class to bolster their status, prerogatives, and they built their fortune on state services to have such opportunities (Skocpol 1979, 49). Thus, the economic interests of the landed upper classes were in part obstacles to be overcome. These states were caught in a tough situation where the state decided to update their status {{in the international arena}} or fix the domestic class structure among {{the rich and the poor}} (Skocpol 1979, 50).|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} several decades, {{economic}} historians have shown that in the century prior to the great Revolution the French economy was not stagnant. Although the economy {{may not have been}} as buoyant as that of Britain, it was not economic catastrophe that prompted the <b>Old</b> <b>Regime’s</b> political demise. The rehabilitation of the <b>Old</b> <b>Regime’s</b> economy has largely been the work of historians and economists working on particular sectors or particular problems. In their efforts, they have relied upon a cornucopia of archival material and the tools of microeconomics. But there has been no effort to take advantage of advances in macroeconomics to rethink how the French economy changed over the eighteenth century. Guillaume Daudin makes just such an attempt in Commerce et prospérité...|$|R
5|$|On {{the night}} of 27–28 February 1917, Michael {{attempted}} to return to Gatchina from Petrograd, {{where he had been}} in conference with Rodzianko and from where he had telegraphed the Tsar, but revolutionary patrols and sporadic fire prevented his progress. Revolutionaries patrolled the streets, rounding up people connected with the <b>old</b> <b>regime.</b> Michael managed to reach the Winter Palace, where he ordered the guards to withdraw to the Admiralty, because it afforded greater safety and a better tactical position, and because it was a less politically charged location. Michael himself took refuge in the apartment of an acquaintance, Princess Putyatina, on Millionnaya street. In the neighbouring apartments, the Tsar's Chamberlain Nikolai Stolypin and the Procurator of the Holy Synod were detained by revolutionaries and in the house next door General Baron Staekelberg was killed when his house was stormed by a mob.|$|E
5|$|In 1249, Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson was slain by {{a knight}} {{who appears to}} have been an {{accomplice}} of Haraldr Guðrøðarson. Immediately following the assassination, Haraldr Guðrøðarson first appears in the mediaeval Chronicle of Mann, the main historical source for the Crovan dynasty, when it records that he took control of the island-kingdom and replaced the chieftains of the <b>old</b> <b>regime</b> with followers of his own choosing. Although he was recognised as the legitimate ruler of the kingdom by Henry III, King of England at first, he was later summoned to Norway by Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway, for his seizure of the kingdom. Upon his removal from Mann, Haraldr Guðrøðarson is not heard from again. In his absence, Magnús Óláfsson, yet another son of Óláfr, unsuccessfully attempted to seize Mann with Hebridean and Norwegian military support. The leadership of the Manx defenders in this action may have been adherents to Haraldr Guðrøðarson's cause. Even so, Magnús returned two years later and succeeded to the kingship, becoming the last of the sea-kings of the Crovan dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Lodge later {{claimed the}} South Vietnamese {{prosecutors}} {{failed to make}} any case against Cẩn. The Vietnamese leader also {{had to contend with}} {{the other side of the}} arguments, from those who considered themselves to be victims of the Diệm regime. During the trial, Thích Trí Quang, along with other opponents of the <b>old</b> <b>regime,</b> lobbied for a death sentence for Cẩn. He argued that if Cẩn lived, he could regain power along with his late brothers' supporters. He told Lodge that if the Americans did not support a tough sentence, then the Vietnamese Buddhist community's opinion of Washington would fall. Lodge was initially critical of Quang's campaigning against Cẩn. Cẩn was sentenced to death. He appealed to the head of state for clemency; his lawyers used a provision in the legal code to make the appeal. This placed Minh — who was still the titular head of state — in the position of approving a third death in the Ngô family, having already ordered his bodyguard Nguyễn Văn Nhung to execute Diệm and Nhu during the coup.|$|E
25|$|The end {{of history}} is, alas, also {{the end of the}} dustbins of history. There are no longer any dustbins for {{disposing}} of <b>old</b> ideologies, <b>old</b> <b>regimes,</b> <b>old</b> values. Where are we going to throw Marxism, which actually invented the dustbins of history? (Yet there is some justice here since the very people who invented them have fallen in.) Conclusion: if there are no more dustbins of history, this is because History itself has become a dustbin. It has become its own dustbin, just as the planet itself is becoming its own dustbin.|$|R
50|$|Remnants {{from the}} <b>older</b> <b>regime</b> {{and from the}} demonstrations {{themselves}} were also used by artists during the revolution, by transforming a police station into an art gallery or transforming burnt out cars into works of art, for instance. Villas belonging to the Trabelsis, the family of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's wife Leïla Ben Ali, became the target of graffiti artists soon after the regime's downfall.|$|R

5|$|Section 10 {{requires}} the authorisation of any prosecution {{by the director}} of the appropriate prosecution agency before a case can go ahead; this is a shift from the <b>old</b> <b>regime,</b> which required the consent of the Attorney General for England and Wales. Section 11 explains the penalties for individuals and companies found guilty of committing a crime. If an individual is found guilty of a bribery offence, tried as a summary offence, they may be imprisoned for up to 12 months and fined up to £5,000. Someone found guilty on indictment, however, faces up to 10 years' imprisonment and an unlimited fine. The crime of a commercial organisation failing to prevent bribery is punishable by an unlimited fine. In addition, a convicted individual or organisation may be subject to a confiscation order under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, while a company director who is convicted may be disqualified under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986.|$|E

25|$|The old {{judicial}} system, {{based on}} the 13 regional parlements, was suspended in November 1789, and officially abolished in September 1790. The main institutional pillars of the <b>old</b> <b>regime</b> had vanished overnight.|$|E
25|$|Symbolism was {{a device}} to {{distinguish}} the main features of the Revolution and ensure public identification and support. In order to effectively illustrate {{the differences between the}} new Republic and the <b>old</b> <b>regime,</b> the leaders needed to implement a new set of symbols to be celebrated instead of the old religious and monarchical symbolism. To this end, symbols were borrowed from historic cultures and redefined, while those of the <b>old</b> <b>regime</b> were either destroyed or reattributed acceptable characteristics. These revised symbols were used to instil in the public a new sense of tradition and reverence for the Enlightenment and the Republic.|$|E

50|$|The MDF was now {{divided in}} two major {{internal}} tendencies.

The Antall government carried important reforms through that completed Hungary's transition from communist rule, e.g. laws on local administration, {{the status of}} civil servants and redemption of the <b>old</b> <b>regime's</b> wrongs. Still, traditional and religious values and national ideas played {{a greater role in}} the MDF's rhetorics than in its conservative and Christian democratic counterparts in Western European countries.|$|R

25|$|A 2017 National Bureau of Economic Research paper {{found that}} the {{emigration}} of more than 100,000 individuals (predominantly supporters of the <b>Old</b> <b>Regime)</b> during the Revolution had a significant negative impact on income per capita in the 19th century (due to the fragmentation of agricultural holdings) but became positive {{in the second half}} of the 20th century onward (because it facilitated the rise in human capital investments).|$|E
25|$|Some {{vestiges of}} the <b>old</b> <b>regime</b> {{remained}} codified as well, such as the law that Hutu military officials {{were not allowed to}} marry Tutsi women. As well, Habyarimana assured the Hutu majority that a Hutu leader would always be the “leader and protector” of the republic. Thus, Juvénal Habyarimana still defined the terms of the “reconciliation” as Tutsis remained politically subservient under his regime.|$|E
50|$|The most {{significant}} {{event of the}} period for the IUS, however, was the turmoil the organization encountered after the 1989 - 1991 fall of Communism (see also World Federation of Democratic Youth) during which the IUS lost most of its funding. Additionally, in August 1991, the Czechoslovak Minister of the Interior decided to expel the IUS and other Communist front organizations from Czechoslovakia. The reasons given for the expulsion were close ties with the <b>old</b> Communist <b>regime</b> and abuse of tax privileges granted during the <b>old</b> Communist <b>regime.</b>|$|R

40|$|Book synopsis: Across Europe, {{it is in}} {{the context}} of {{primitive}} "country" (counties, duchies, principalities) that nobility affirmed their political vocation. The absorption of these "country" in larger groups did not abolish representation structures (assemblies of states, diets, Cortes) in which the noble body flourished as "representatives babies' territories being of provincialism. This book examines the role that the European nobility played in the phenomena of resistance and renewal of intermediate powers under the <b>old</b> <b>regimes.</b> It extends the discussion beyond 1789 to understand how, in France, the nobility has adapted to the changing territorial frameworks and centralization of power...|$|R
