25|$|I {{had watched}} Ken Barrington – a great Test batsman – {{as a boy}} and when I broke into the England side in the late Seventies he became a father figure. In fact, he was a mentor {{to a lot of}} us then – myself, David Gower, Ian Botham, Mike Gatting. Ken was an England {{selector}} and assistant manager on the West Indies tour of 1981. There were no official coach in those days but it was to Ken that most of us turned. Unlike many retired pros, he never used the words, 'In my day...' On the first night of the Test, he suffered a heart attack in <b>our</b> <b>hotel.</b> I was woken the next morning at around 8am by tour manager Alan Smith and captain Ian Botham. I knew something was wrong, because Both was never up before then. They told me the news. I had tears in my eyes when we went out on to the pitch for the minute's silence and again when I was batting in the second innings. We needed over 500 to win and it soon became apparent that we weren't going to get them. But I kept thinking of him and managed to make a hundred. Kenny was a counsellor, a friend and an inspiration.|$|E
500|$|I {{think the}} {{standard}} of our cricket was really good. We were up to the mark in the finals. We lost as a team. There were a few errors in batting and bowling. We're not really unhappy or bogged down by it. We'll go back to <b>our</b> <b>hotel</b> and enjoy it. That's what sport is all about. the response from our team was great. even the guys who didn't get a chance were completely behind the team. So the spirit was great." ...|$|E
500|$|Turner also {{appeared}} in four films with Clark Gable between 1941 and 1954, beginning with Honky Tonk (1941). The Turner-Gable films' successes were heightened by gossip-column rumors about {{a relationship between the}} two. In January 1942, she began shooting her second picture with Gable, titled Somewhere I'll Find You; however, the production was halted for several weeks after the death of Gable's wife, Carole Lombard, in a plane crash. Meanwhile, the press continued to fuel rumors that Turner and Gable were romantic offscreen, which Turner vehemently denied. Consequently, the publicity generated by this would lead MGM to play up her image as a sex symbol in her following film, a romantic comedy titled Slightly Dangerous (1943). In promotion of Somewhere I'll Find You, Turner embarked on a nationwide war bond tour, during which she returned to her hometown of Wallace, Idaho with her mother, where she was greeted with a large celebration: [...] "We checked into <b>our</b> <b>hotel,</b> and were told that the Mayor had declared a holiday in my honor," [...] she recalled. [...] "A banner stretched across the street read, in large letters, WELCOME HOME, LANA. We'd been in our rooms only a few moments when people who claimed to have known us when we lived in Wallace began knocking on the door." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sandy Smith, {{the editor}} of the 2007 BBC {{television}} programme Panorama, alleged that his team had been subjected to Fair Game tactics from the Church while filming the documentary [...] "Scientology and Me". When the team were filming in the United States, Scientology representatives followed them and repeatedly harangued them. Unknown men also trailed the team, one even appearing at journalist John Sweeney's wedding. Sweeney later complained of being [...] "chased round the streets of Los Angeles by sinister strangers [...] In LA, the moment our hire car left the airport we realised we were being followed by two cars. In <b>our</b> <b>hotel</b> a weird stranger spent every breakfast listening to us." [...] When the crew returned to London, Church executive Mike Rinder was sent from the United States to lobby the BBC, even camping out at their offices.|$|E

There ain't enough big towns and places to work in; besides, at <b>our</b> <b>hotels</b> there ain't the same chance {{of getting to know}} people that there is at home, or in Paris, or in those places. People sit down to a little table to {{themselves}} to their meals, and there is no sort of general meeting-place. You would find it very hard to work it. Got some money, I suppose?' ...|$|R

40|$|Supply Chain Management is at {{the heart}} of {{competitive}} advantage for any organisation. Without Supply Chains, the Hospitality Industry would quickly grind to a halt. There would be no fruit or vegetables in our restaurants, no beer or wine in our bars and no beds or toilets in <b>our</b> <b>hotels.</b> There would be no recycling of glass or the disposal of food products. There would be no customers. Given the importance of Supply Chains to the Hospitality Industry it is perhaps surprising that so little is published about Supply Chains and how Supply Chains can be managed. The aim of this working paper is to define SCM and establish an agenda for undertaking research into this important but neglected topic...|$|R
60|$|The faults of tea, as too {{commonly}} found at <b>our</b> <b>hotels</b> and boarding-houses, {{are that it}} is made in every way the reverse of what it should be. The water is hot, perhaps, but not boiling; the tea has a general flat, stale, smoky taste, devoid of life or spirit; and it is served, usually, with thin milk instead of cream. Cream is as essential to the richness of tea as of coffee. We could wish that the English fashion might generally prevail, of giving the traveler his own kettle of boiling water and his own tea-chest, and letting him make tea for himself. At all events he would then be sure of one merit in his tea,--it would be hot, a very simple and obvious virtue, but one very seldom obtained.|$|R

60|$|A {{thoroughly}} good inn, in {{the days}} of coaching and posting, was a noble place. But no such inn would have been equal to the reception of four or five hundred people, all of them wet through, and half of them dead sick, every day in the year. This is where we shine, in <b>our</b> Pavilionstone <b>Hotel.</b> Again - who, coming and going, pitching and tossing, boating and training, hurrying in, and flying out, could ever have calculated the fees to be paid at an old-fashioned house? In <b>our</b> Pavilionstone <b>Hotel</b> vocabulary, there is no such word as fee. Everything is done for you; every service is provided at a fixed and reasonable charge; all the prices are hung up in all the rooms; and you can make out your own bill beforehand, as well as the book-keeper.|$|R

The company expanded into the fields of fuel wholesaling and truck dealerships. He further served on numerous civic and bank boards and donated to academic and athletic programs at Texas Tech University as well as LCU. A lifelong baseball enthusiast, Griffin is honored with the naming of the Rip Griffin Baseball Park on the Tech campus. The Geneva Griffin Center at the Children's Home of Lubbock is {{named in honor of}} Mrs. Griffin. For four decades, Griffin sponsored the Lubbock Hubber baseball club, a semi-professional team.Griffin once noted that hosting tournaments had varying consequences with more people visiting Lubbock and [...] "they’re going to stay in <b>our</b> <b>hotels,</b> they’re going to eat in our restaurants, and best of all, they’re going to buy gasoline." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you what I saw the other night, girls, in the parlor of one of <b>our</b> <b>hotels.</b> Two middle-aged Quaker ladies came gliding in, with calm, cheerful faces, and lustrous dove-colored silks. By their {{conversation}} I found that they belonged to that class of women among the Friends who devote themselves to traveling on missions of benevolence. They had just completed a tour of all the hospitals for wounded soldiers in the country, where they had been carrying comforts, arranging, advising, and soothing by their cheerful, gentle presence. They were now engaged on another mission, to the lost and erring of their own sex; night after night, guarded by a policeman, they had ventured after midnight into the dance-houses where girls are being led to ruin, and with gentle words of tender, motherly counsel sought to win them from their fatal ways,--telling them where they might go the next day to find friends who would open to them an asylum and aid them to seek a better life.|$|R

6000|$|She was by {{no means}} as unmoved as she gave out.
