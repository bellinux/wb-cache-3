The contestant and chaser are presented with the same multiple choice question, and each locks in their answer, which cannot then be changed; the other has five seconds to answer after them, otherwise they are locked out and do not advance on the gameboard. For each question the contestant answers correctly, the prize money shown on the gameboard moves <b>one</b> <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> to the team bank. Similarly, the chaser moves <b>one</b> <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> to the contestant's prize money with each correct answer. Further questions are asked until the contestant reaches {{the end of the}} board (thus banking the prize money), or the chaser catches the contestant, eliminating them from the game. No movement is made by the contestant or the chaser if an incorrect answer is provided or if they are locked out by the time limit.|$|E

5|$|The goal of elucidating {{pathophysiology}} {{has also}} led to increased interest in the association between risk-SNPs and the gene expression of nearby genes, the so-called expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies.

As a result, major GWA studies by 2011 typically included extensive eQTL analysis. One of the strongest eQTL effects observed for a GWA-identified risk SNP is the SORT1 locus.

40|$|ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Molecular {{methods to}} detect Leishmania parasites are {{considered}} specific and sensitive, but often not applied in endemic areas {{of developing countries}} due to technical complexity. In the present study isothermal, nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA) was coupled to oligochromatography (OC) to develop a simplified detection method for the diagnosis of leishmaniasis. NASBA-OC, detecting Leishmania RNA, was evaluated using clinical samples from visceral leishmaniasis patients from East Africa (n= 30) and cutaneous leishmaniasis from South America (n= 70) and appropriate control samples. RESULTS: Analytical sensitivity was 10 parasites/ml of spiked blood, and 1 parasite/ml of culture. Diagnostic sensitivity of NASBA-OC was 93. 3 % (95 % CI: 76. 5 %- 98. 8 %) and specificity was 100 % (95 % CI: 91. 1 %- 100 %) on blood samples, while sensitivity and specificity on skin biopsy samples was 98. 6 % (95 % CI: 91. 2 %- 99. 9 %) and 100 % (95 % CI: 46. 3 %- 100 %), respectively. CONCLUSION: The NASBA-OC format brings implementation of molecular diagnosis of leishmaniasis in resource poor countries <b>one</b> <b>step</b> <b>close...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{taxonomy}} set out by Bouchet & Rocroi is {{an attempt}} to get <b>one</b> <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> to representing this part of the evolutionary history of the phylum Mollusca. Bouchet & Rocroi's classification system is a hybrid of the pre-existing, more traditional Linnaean taxonomy along with some more recent far-reaching revisions which are based on molecular work and use clades as taxa, (see cladistics). In the past, the taxonomy of gastropods was largely based on the morphological characters of the taxa, such as the shell characteristics (including the protoconch) in shelled species, and the internal anatomy, including the structure of the radula and details of the reproductive system. Recent advances are based more on the molecular characteristics of the DNA and RNA. This shift in emphasis has meant that the newer taxa and their hierarchy are subject to debate, a debate that {{is not likely to be}} resolved soon.|$|E

25|$|In the 1830s, the British were {{firmly entrenched}} in India but by 1837, feared a Russian {{invasion}} through the Khyber and Bolan Passes as the Russian Empire had expanded towards the British dominion. The British sent an envoy to Kabul {{to form an}} alliance with Afghanistan's emir, Dost Muhammad against Russia. The Emir was in favour of an alliance but wanted British help in recapturing Peshawar which the Sikhs had captured in 1834. The British refused to help. Dost Muhammad then started negotiating with the Russians who had also sent an envoy to Kabul. This led the Governor General of India, Lord Auckland to conclude that Dost Muhammad was anti-British. British fears of a Russian invasion of India took <b>one</b> <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> to becoming a reality when negotiations between the Afghans and Russians broke down in 1838.
