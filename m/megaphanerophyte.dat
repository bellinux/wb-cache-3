40|$|AbstractThe {{life form}} and leaf size spectra of plant {{species of the}} Thandiani forests, {{district}} Abbottabad, were studied {{during the summer of}} 2013. These forests host 252 plant species of 97 families. Biological spectra showed that Hemicryptophytes (80 spp., 31. 74 %) were dominant followed by <b>Megaphanerophytes</b> (51 spp., 20. 24 %), Therophytes (49 spp., 19. 44 %) and Nanophanerophytes (45 spp., 17. 86). Hemicryptophytes are the indicators of cold temperate vegetation. At the lower elevations, <b>Megaphanerophytes</b> and Nanophanerophytes were dominant which confirm trees as dominant habit form due to high soil depth, moisture and temperature factors. Data on Leaf spectra in the area showed that Microphyllous (88 spp., 34. 92 %) species were dominant followed by Leptophyllous (74 spp., 29. 36 %) and Nanophyllous (60 spp., 23. 80 %). The Microphyllous plants again are the indicator of cold temperate zone as the area is situated at an elevation of 1191 – 2626 m. Similarly, Nanophylls were dominant at lower elevations. Data on family importance values and diversity among various communities were also recorded. Life form and Leaf spectra studies could be used to understand the micro climatic variation of the region...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of floristic studies conducted in the years 2003 - 2005 within the area of the Polesie National Park. The aim of the research was to compare the flora of initial succession stages in drainage ditches with the flora of neighbouring forest areas undergoing transformation as a result of drainage. Floristic lists were made in four designated study areas as well as in forest phytocoenoses. The results of field investigations were subjected to analysis with regard to the systematic affinity of the flora and proportions of plant life-forms as well as of historical-geographical groups and range groups. In the species composition of the studied drainage ditches hemicryptophytes were the dominant group of plant higher life-forms, whereas in the neighbouring communities the flora was represented by both hemicryptophytes and <b>megaphanerophytes.</b> In historical and geographical terms, the flora of drainage ditches and neighbouring communities represents definitely the group of spontaneophytes. Anthropogenic habitats, which developed within the drainage ditches, were colonised by native flora species characteristic for the Polesie National Park area...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} reveals a {{description}} of floristic features like life form, leaf size spectra and ethnobotany of valley Samahni. This study was carried out during the years 2006 - 2008, in Samahni valley district Bhimber A. K. (Pakistan), using methods consisting of semi-structured interviews employing a check list of questions, questionnaires, direct observations and biological inventories. It provides information about different local plants and their life form and leaf size spectra. 120 plant species recorded belonging to 46 families. Poaceae is the dominating with 14 members. Among these {{the most of the}} plants are used to cure common diseases like diarrhea, earache, fever, jaundice, flu, cough and other skin diseases. Snake bite, wound healing and burning of body part are also treated with local herbs. Many plants are used for multiple purposes like as medicines, food, fodder, fuel, furniture and shelter. Due to deforestation vegetation is eliminating rapidly. But the efforts and knowledge about plant wealth conservation is at initial stages. <b>Megaphanerophytes</b> are dominating followed by therophytes. Hemicryptophytes, Nanophanerophytes and Geophytes come after these respectively. All the types of vegetation depend upon presence of trees. In leaf size spectra Microphyllous are dominant followed by Megaphyllous. This work can be the base for advance research in different fields like phytochemistry, molecular biochemistry and antimicrobial plant secondary metabolites. For further research this ethnobotanical work is very important because it has come into existence with large experience of ancient history...|$|R
40|$|In Chinese botanical literature, {{the term}} “tropical monsoon forest” is {{explained}} and used inconsistently {{and is often}} confused with tropical rain forest. My objective is to clarify {{differences between the two}} forests. Schimper defined tropical monsoon forest as being more or less leafless during the dry season and considered it a transitional vegetation type between tropical rain forest and savanna in terms of physiognomy and distribution. I compared tropical monsoon forest and rain forest in physiognomy, floristic composition and geographical elements to describe and characterize the monsoon forest in Yunnan, China. The tropical monsoon forest in Yunnan occurs mainly on river banks and in basins of several large rivers below 1 000 m altitude. The forest has one or two tree layers, and trees of at least the top layer are deciduous in the dry season. In life forms, the forest is rich in hemicryptophytes and relatively rich in geophytes and therophytes, but less rich in woody lianas and almost lacks <b>megaphanerophytes</b> and chamaephytes compared to tropical rain forest. In leaf size and form, the forest has more microphyllous leaves and compound leaves (24 % and 44 % of tree species, respectively) than tropical rain forest. In terms of floristic elements, the forest has a greater percentage of species of pantropic distribution (30 % of the genera) and tropical Asia and tropical Africa disjunct distribution than tropical rain forest. Thus, the tropical monsoon forest in Yunnan has more diverse geographical elements in its flora and a complicated evolution history...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} 2011 – 2012. It included {{an analysis of the}} spontaneous flora of 7 cemeteries: 3 cemeteries located in the centre of Lublin (Lipowa Street, Unicka Street, and Kalina Street), 1 {{on the outskirts of the}} city (Majdanek), 1 located in a small town (Łęczna), 2 sites are rural cemeteries (Łuszczów, Ostrówek). An inventory was made of spontaneous vascular flora present at the investigated sites. The plants were described in respect of their affiliation to geographical-historical groups, life forms as well as the presence of honey species (polleniferous and nectariferous) and protected species. Within the area of these 7 necropolises, the presence of 382 taxa was found. The number of taxa observed at the individual sites varied between 124 and 274 in the metropolitan zone, 146 in the urban zone, and between 110 and 146 in the rural areas. 			 			The area richest in terms of flora was Majdanek where 274 species of plants were found, while the cemetery in Łuszczów was the least rich – 110 species. The highest precentage of hemicryptophytes was observed in Ostrówek (50. 7 %), the lowest in Lublin – Kalina (40. 3 %). In the case of therophytes, the greatest variation was observed in the urban cemetery in Unicka Street (32. 6 %), while the least varied site was the cemetery in Ostrówek (23. 3 %). The average precentage of geophytes was 12. 1 %, with the greatest number in Łuszczów (16. 4 %), and the smallest one in Majdanek (8. 4 %). Chamaephytes were characterised by a small percentage (between 5. 1 % and 4. 4 %), similarly to nanophanerophytes (6. 2 % to 2. 7 %), and <b>megaphanerophytes</b> (9. 6 %– 1. 8 %). The investigated sites were dominated by apophytes, the percentage of which varied between 52. 3 % in the Lublin cemeteries on Lipowa and Unicka Streets, and 44. 5 % in Ostrówek. 			 			Among anthropophytes, there were mostly archeophytes (between 26. 3 % in Łuszczów and 13. 1 % on Lipowa St. in Lublin). The percentage of diaphytes varied between 16. 5 % in Ostrówek and 7. 2 % in Lublin – Kalina, whereas that of kenophytes was between 15. 1 % in Ostrówek and 8. 2 % in Łęczna. In the case of spontaneophytes, the percentage varied between 8. 8 % in Lublin – Majdanek and 2. 7 % in Łuszczów. The majority, 299 of the taxa found, proved invaluable to insects (polleniferous and nectariferous). Among the plants growing spontaneously in the analysed cemeteries, there were also 11 legally protected species. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is multi-dimensional including floristic composition, ecological characterization, ethnobotany, vegetation structure, biomass productivity, palatability {{and animal}} preferences, mineral and nutritional analysis of some forage plants of Gadoon Hills, District Swabi, Pakistan during 2009 and 2010. There were 260 plant species belonging to 211 genera and 90 families. Asteraceae, Poaceae, Lamiaceae, Rosaceae, Papilionaceae, Brasicaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Moraceae, Polygonaceae and Caryophyllaceae were important {{families in the}} studied area. Acacia modesta, Acacia catechu, Butea frondosa and Mallotus philippensis were the well represented tree species in tropical deciduous and subtropical zones, while Pinus roxburghii, Quercus dilatata, Q. incana, Parratiopsis jacquemontiana, Lonicera quinquilocularis, Cotoneaster bacillaris, Vibernum cotinifolium and Prunus cornuta were common at high altitude. Viscum album and Korthalsella opuntia were the mistletoe and Cuscuta reflexa was the only parasite in Gadoon Hills. Shrubs like Carissa spinarum, Dodonaea viscosa, Gymnosporia royleana, Justicia adhatoda, Otostegia limbata, Sageretia theezans and Zizyphus nummularia were encountered at low altitude while Berberis lycium, Indigofera heterantha and Sarcococa saligna at the temperate zone. Apluda mutica, Aristida adscensionis, Heteropogon contortus, Chrysopogon aucheri and Themeda anathera {{were more or less}} evenly distributed in the investigated area. Some pteridophytes along with other temperate herbs like Berginia ciliate, Bistorta amplexicaulis, Valeriana jatamansii and Viola serpens were also recorded in the temperate forests. The biological spectrum showed that therophytes and <b>megaphanerophytes</b> were the most abundant life forms. Microphylls and leptophylls were dominant in the area. Gadoon Hills have rich plant diversity in relation to local uses. These included medicinal (149 spp.), fodder (82 spp.), fuel wood (59 spp.), vegetable (26 spp.), thatching/ roofing and sheltering (25 spp.), fruit yielding (22 spp.), fencing (17 spp.), ornamental (16 spp.), timber wood and poisonous (14 spp. each), agricultural tools making (10 spp.) and honeybee (8 spp.) Based on cluster analysis the summer and winter vegetation of Gadoon Hills have been classified into three distinct vegetation types i. e. tropical, sub-tropical and temperate zone, occupying different altitudinal confines. Thirteen communities were recognized in each of the summer and winter seasons. The colour of the soil varied from brown to yellowish brown, grey brown. Soils were generally shallow and made up of sandstone and limestone. The texture of the soil varied from sandy to sandy loam. The pH of the soil ranged from 5. 2 to 7. 64 among the summer and winter showing almost no change. Organic matter contents differed insignificantly among the two seasons. Significant differences were observed in mineral contents among the communities while the differences among the seasons were insignificant. The plant communities inhabiting Gadoon Hills during summer and winter were mostly heterogeneous. Heterogeneity might be due to the presence of large number of annuals and habitat degradation, climate, soil conditions, deforestation, overgrazing, trampling and soil erosion in the study area. Seasonal availability of palatable fodder species depended on climate and phenological stage. It was recorded that there were 57 species available in April, 56 in May, 60 in June, 59 in July, 55 in August, 42 in September and 30 species in October. The evergreen perennial species were found throughout the year. Of the total 260 recorded species in the study area, 82 plants were palatable. Among them, 26. 83...|$|R
