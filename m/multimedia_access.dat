Compression with bit rates between 6 kbit/s and 24 kbit/s is addressed. Furthermore the implementation of special effects like independent pitch change and speed change in the decoder is described. 1 Introduction Many applications for very low bit rate storage and transmission of digital audio signals mainly focus on speech signals. Therefore a lot of optimizations for speech codecs operating at bit rates between 6 and 16 kbit/s were carried out during the past years. However there is an increasing interest in extensions which also allow the transmission of music signals in areas like mobile communications or <b>multimedia</b> database <b>access</b> via modem and analog telephone lines [1].

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a novel approach}} to implement <b>multimedia</b> <b>access</b> platforms: reconfigurable oriented co-design. Nowadays we observe a rapid and mutant evolution of multimedia standards and its de facto adoption into many consumer electronics, such as audio/video appliances, digital set-top boxes for TV access networks, mobile technologies and portable digital assistants (PDAs). Among the disadvantages of current <b>multimedia</b> <b>access</b> platforms, we can mention the relative high cost, the very short obsolescence cycles, the communication and computational performance limitations, the large sizes of software components, and system architectures that do not match future multimedia standards requirements. To overcome these, we propose {{the use of a}} reconfigurable computing architecture to implement a family of <b>multimedia</b> <b>access</b> platforms. As an example, we present an implementation of a <b>multimedia</b> <b>access</b> platform that runs a web browser (HTML 3. 2 compatible) over a 32 -bit RISC microprocessor, described using less than 256 Kbytes of data to represent software and hardware components on a FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) ...|$|E
