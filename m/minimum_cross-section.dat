40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study is}} presented {{of the mechanical}} properties of low-density open-cell polymer foams subjected to large deformations. The foams are modelled as three-dimensional frameworks of slender struts. Regular as well as random foams are analyzed, where the latter are generated using the Voronoi technique. The macroscopic mechanical properties are determined for various types of struts properties through unit-cell analyses containing many foam cells per unit-cell. The computations make use of standard Finite Element (FE) techniques. Bending of the struts dominates the mechanical foam response at low strains. Axial deformation of the struts becomes the dominant mechanism at larger tensile strains. Strut buckling becomes the main mechanism at larger compressive strains, and causes {{a significant decrease in}} load carrying capacity of the foam. The large strain mechanical behavior of foams is found to be dependent on the weakest cross-section of the foam appearing in the random foam structure, the so-called "minimum effective cross-section". The <b>minimum</b> effective <b>cross-section</b> determines the tangential foam modulus at large tensile strains. Regular foam structures have a uniform unit-cell cross-section and, as a result, a higher <b>minimum</b> effective <b>cross-section</b> than regular foam structures and, therefore, a higher tangent modulus in the large strain range. ...|$|R

40|$|Conductance histograms are a {{valuable}} tool to study the intrinsic conduction properties of metallic atomic-sized contacts. These histograms show a peak structure, which is characteristic {{of the type of}} metal under investigation. Despite the enormous progress in the understanding of the electronic transport in metallic nanowires, the origin of this peak structure is still a basic open problem. In the present work we tackle this issue, extending our theoretical analysis of Au conductance histograms [Dreher et al., PRB 72, 075435 (2005) ] to different types of metals, namely, Ag, Pt and ferromagnetic Ni. We combine classical molecular dynamics simulations of the breaking of nanocontacts with conductance calculations based on a tight-binding model. This combination gives us access to crucial information such as contact geometries, strain forces, <b>minimum</b> <b>cross-sections,</b> the conductance, transmissions of the individual conduction channels and, in the case of Ni, the spin polarization of the current. We shall also briefly discuss investigations of Al atomic-sized contacts. From our analysis we conclude that the differences in the histograms of these metals are due to (i) the very different electronic structures, which means different atomic orbitals contributing to the transport, and (ii) the different mechanical properties, which in a case like Pt lead to the formation of special structures, namely monoatomic chains. Of particular interest are results for Ni that indicate the absence of any conductance quantization, and show how the current polarization evolves (including large fluctuations) from negative values in thick contacts to even positive values in the tunneling regime after rupture of the contact. Finally, we also present a detailed analysis of the breaking forces of these metallic contacts. Comment: 22 pages, 19 figure...|$|R

40|$|Flying insects use {{the optic}} flow to {{navigate}} safely in unfamiliar environments, especially by adjusting their speed and their clearance from surrounding objects. It {{has not yet}} been established, however, which specific parts of the optical flow field insects use to control their speed. With a view to answering this question, freely flying honeybees were trained to fly along a specially designed tunnel including two successive tapering parts: the first part was tapered in the vertical plane and the second one, in the horizontal plane. The honeybees were found to adjust their speed {{on the basis of the}} optic flow they perceived not only in the lateral and ventral parts of their visual field, but also in the dorsal part. More specifically, the honeybees ’ speed varied monotonically, depending on the <b>minimum</b> <b>cross-section</b> of the tunnel, regardless of whether the narrowing occurred in the horizontal or vertical plane.

40|$|Introduction: The {{type and}} {{severity}} of mandibulofacial abnormalities affects {{the size and shape}} of the pharynx as patients affected by these conditions often have complaints of snoring and respiratory difficulties during sleep. Purpose: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the volume and morphology of nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal and the total airway of patients affected by mandibulofacial abnormalities (unilateral cleft lip and palate [UCLP], and craniometaphyseal dysplasia [CMD]) and to compare them with a matched control group without any mandibulofacial abnormalities. Methods: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) records of 80 patients (30 UCLP and 10 CMD along with 40 age and gender-matched controls) were collected. Volumetric analysis was performed using image segmentation features in MIMICS 15. 0 (Materialise, Levuen, Belgium) to evaluate the nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal and total airway volumes, as well as the airway morphology. Minimum cross-sectional area was determined using InVivo Dental 5. 3 (Anatomage, San Jose, California). Statistical analysis with SPSS 22. 0 (IBM, Armonk, NY) was done to evaluate inter- and intra-operator reliability by using Cronbach 2 ̆ 7 s alpha and paired t-test. Results: Patients affected by UCLP had statistically significant smaller naso-, hypopharyngeal and total airway volumes, smaller <b>minimum</b> <b>cross-section</b> area, and a more circularly shaped oropharynx when compared with the controls. The CMD group presented the same airway shape as UCLP patients and statistically significant smaller volumes of all pharyngeal regions as well as total airway and <b>minimum</b> <b>cross-section</b> area when compared with the controls.
