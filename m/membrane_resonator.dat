This coupling presents an opportunity for manipulating the quantum state of light, connecting different quantum resources, and ultra-sensitive force detectors. A particular enabling platform utilizes high-stress silicon-nitride <b>membrane</b> <b>resonators.</b> Because of its large tensile stress, the membrane exhibits remarkable mechanical quality factors (Qs) that are even {{higher than that of}} single crystalline silicon. The membrane with such high Q combined with robust cryogenic Fabry-Perot cavity enables a variety of quantum optics experiments, such as squeezed light generation. Improving upon these encouraging results requires understanding and engineering the <b>membrane</b> <b>resonators.</b> The <b>membrane</b> dissipation can be classified as the internal loss and the external loss.

40|$|The cochlea is {{an organ}} which {{extracts}} frequency {{information from the}} input sound wave. It also produces nerve signals, which are further analysed by the brain and ultimately lead to perception of the sound. An existing model of the cochlea by Fragni`ere is first analysed by simulation. This passive model is found to have the properties that the living cochlea does {{in terms of the}} frequency response. An analog VLSI circuit implementation of this cochlear model in CMOS weak inversion is proposed, using log-domain filters in current domain. It is fabricated on a chip and a measurement of a basilar membrane section is performed. The measurement shows a reasonable agreement to the model. However, the circuit is found to have a problem related to transistor mismatch, causing different behaviour in identical circuit blocks. An active cochlear model is proposed to overcome this problem. The model incorporates the effect of the outer hair cells in the living cochlea, which controls the quality factor of the basilar membrane filters. The outer hair cells are incorporated as an extra voltage source in series with the basilar <b>membrane</b> <b>resonator.</b> Its value saturates as the input signal becomes larger, making the behaviour rather closer to that of a passive model. The simulation results show this nonlinear phenomenon, which is also seen in the living cochlea.

Reaching this quantum regime entails, i. a., quantum measurement backaction exceeding thermal forces, and thus detectable optomechanical quantum correlations. In particular, we observe ponderomotive squeezing of the output light mediated by a multitude of mechanical resonator modes, with quantum noise suppression up to - 2. 4 dB (- 3. 6 dB if corrected for detection losses) and bandwidths ≲ 90 kHz. The multi-mode nature of the employed membrane and Fabry-Perot resonators lends itself to hybrid entanglement schemes involving multiple electromagnetic, mechanical, and spin degrees of freedom.

When two multiple-frequency HMRs are used, absorption in the range of near 60 % to above 80 % is observed at 403 Hz, 450 Hz, 688 Hz, 863 Hz and 945 Hz. Theoretical predictions agree well with the experimental data.

40|$|Most MEMS {{piezoelectric}} {{vibration energy}} harvesters involve either cantilever-based topologies, doubly-clamped beams or membrane structures. While these traditional designs offer simplicity, their frequency response for broadband excitation are typically inadequate. This paper presents a new integrated cantilever-on-membrane design {{that attempts to}} both optimise the strain distribution on a piezoelectric <b>membrane</b> <b>resonator</b> and improve the power responsiveness of the harvester for broadband excitation. While a classic membrane-based resonator {{has the potential to}} theoretically offer wider operational frequency bandwidth than its cantilever counterpart, the addition of a centred proof mass neutralises its otherwise high strain energy regions. The proposed topology addresses this issue by relocating the proof mass onto subsidiary cantilevers and integrates the merits of both the membrane and the cantilever designs. When experimentally subjected to a band-limited white noise excitation, up to approximately two folds of power enhancement was observed for the new membrane harvester compared to a classic plain membrane device...|$|E

We measure the resonators using both optical and electrical actuation and detection techniques. We find that the resonators can be modeled as flat membranes under tension, and that clamping the membranes on all sides improves agreement with our model and reduces the variation in frequency between identical resonators. The resonance frequency is tunable with both electrostatic gate voltage and temperature, and quality factors improve dramatically with cooling, reaching values up to 9000 at 10 K. These measurements show {{that it is possible}} to produce large arrays of CVD-grown graphene resonators with reproducible properties and the same excellent electrical and mechanical properties previously reported for exfoliated graphene...|$|R
40|$|We {{measure the}} quality factor Q of {{electrically}} driven few-layer graphene drumhead resonators, providing an experimental demonstration that Q ~ 1 /T, where T is the temperature. We develop {{a model that}} includes intermodal coupling and tensioned graphene resonators. Because the resonators are atomically thin, out-of-plane fluctuations are large. As a result, Q is mainly determined by stochastic frequency broadening rather than frictional damping, in analogy to nuclear magnetic resonance. This model is in good agreement with experiment. Additionally, at larger drives the resonance line width is enhanced by nonlinear damping, in qualitative agreement with recent theory of damping by radiation of in-plane phonons. Parametric amplification produced by periodic thermal expansion from the ac drive voltage yields an anomalously large line width at the largest drives. Our results contribute toward a general framework for understanding the mechanisms of dissipation and spectral line broadening in atomically thin <b>membrane</b> <b>resonators...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{experimental}} realization of perfect sound absorption by sub-wavelength monopole and dipole resonators that exhibit degenerate resonant frequencies. This is achieved through the destructive interference of two resonators' transmission responses, while the matching of their averaged impedances {{to that of}} air implies no backscattering, thereby leading to total absorption. Two examples, both using decorated <b>membrane</b> <b>resonators</b> (DMRs) as the basic units, are presented. The first is a flat panel comprising a DMR {{and a pair of}} coupled DMRs, while the second one is a ventilated short tube containing a DMR in conjunction with a sidewall DMR backed by a cavity.

40|$|Quantum {{transducers}} {{can transfer}} quantum information between different systems. Microwave-optical photon conversion {{is important for}} future quantum networks to interconnect remote superconducting quantum computers with optical fibers. Here we propose a high-speed quantum transducer based on a single-photon emitter in an atomically thin <b>membrane</b> <b>resonator</b> that can couple single microwave photons to single optical photons. The 2 D resonator will be a freestanding van der Waals heterostructure (may consist of graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, or other 2 D materials) that hosts a quantum emitter. The mechanical vibration (phonon) of the 2 D resonator interacts with optical photons by shifting the optical transition frequency of the single-photon emitter with strain or the Stark effect. The mechanical vibration couples to microwave photons by shifting the resonant frequency of a LC circuit that includes the membrane. Thanks to the small mass of the 2 D resonator, both the single-photon optomechanical coupling strength and the electromechanical coupling strength can be about 100 MHz. This provides a way for high-speed quantum state transfer between a microwave photon, a phonon, and an optical photon. Comment: 12 pages, 9 figure...|$|E
40|$|This paper contends to be {{the first}} to report the {{experimental}} observation of up to 28 orders of parametric resonance, which has thus far only been envisioned in the theoretical realm. While theory has long predicted the onset of n orders of parametric resonance, previously reported experimental observations have been limited up to about the first 5 orders. This is due to the rapid narrowing nature of the frequency bandwidth of the higher instability intervals, making practical accessibility increasingly more difficult. Here, the authors have experimentally confirmed up to 28 orders of parametric resonance in a micromachined <b>membrane</b> <b>resonator</b> when electrically undamped. While the implication of this finding spans across the vibration dynamics and transducer application spectrum, the particular significance of this work is to broaden the accumulative operational frequency bandwidth of vibration energy harvesting for enabling self-powered microsystems. Up to 5 orders were recorded when driven at 1. 0 g of acceleration across a matched load of 70 kΩ. With a natural frequency of 980 Hz, the fundamental mode direct resonance had a − 3 dB bandwidth of 55 Hz, in contrast to the 314 Hz for the first order parametric resonance; furthermore, the half power bands of all 5 orders accumulated to 478 Hz...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} feed energy into a system, or - {{equivalently}} - to drive that system with an external input {{is a fundamental}} aspect of light-matter interaction. The key concept in many photonic applications is the "critical coupling" condition: at criticality, all the energy fed to the system via an input channel is dissipated within the system itself. Although this idea was crucial to enhance the efficiency of many devices, it was never considered {{in the context of}} systems operating in a non-perturbative regime. In this so-called strong coupling regime, the matter and light degrees of freedom are in fact mixed into dressed states, leading to new eigenstates called polaritons. Here we demonstrate that the strong coupling regime and the critical coupling condition can indeed coexist; in this situation, which we term strong critical coupling, all the incoming energy is converted into polaritons. A semiclassical theory - equivalently applicable to acoustics or mechanics - reveals that the strong critical coupling corresponds to a special curve in the phase diagram of the coupled light-matter oscillators. In the more general case of a system radiating via two scattering ports, the phenomenology displayed is that of coherent perfect absorption (CPA), which is then naturally understood and described in the framework of critical coupling. Most importantly, we experimentally verify polaritonic CPA in a semiconductor-based intersubband-polariton photonic-crystal <b>membrane</b> <b>resonator.</b> This result opens new avenues in the exploration of polariton physics, making it possible to control the pumping efficiency of a system almost independently of its Rabi energy, i. e., of the energy exchange rate between the electromagnetic field and the material transition...|$|E

The tunability of the reflection is over 23 dB at 388 Hz, and that of the transmission is over 33 dB at 240 Hz and 590 Hz with 600 V of applied voltage.

40|$|Transport of {{acoustic}} phonons {{plays an}} important role in a number of applications, such as thermal management, terahertz phononic filters, and high-frequency mechanical resonators. At the nanoscale, interfaces affect acoustic transport through boundary scattering. The overall aim of this work is to understand how acoustic phonons interact with nanostructured interfaces. We adopt an optical means based on ultrafast lasers to characterize dynamics of phonon (and thermal) transport through interfaces. We examine heat transfer properties of several semiconductor nanostructures using time-domain thermoreflectance and show that forming nanocrystals or nanochannels on the surface reduces the heat conduction rate because of enhanced phonon boundary scattering. Confined acoustic phonon modes may occur in an acoustically isolated medium that is enabled by high acoustic impedance mismatch at the boundaries. We insert a compliant organic (CuPc) film at the Al/Si interface to form a supported <b>membrane</b> <b>resonator.</b> We use femtosecond laser pulses to excite multiple GHz coherent phonon modes in such a cavity. The interfacial CuPc film acts as an acoustic etalon to select certain modes out of the broadband excitation, according to its Fabry-Perot resonances. Our observations have scientific significance in understanding coherent acoustic phonon transport, and support future studies of manipulating high-frequency acoustic energy in nanostructures. Interface irregularities such as roughness affect transport of acoustic phonons due to their short wavelengths. We develop a theoretical model based on perturbation analysis to calculate the specular and quasi-diffuse fields produced by scattering. We evaluate the effect of interface roughness on phonon mode conversion, scattered field distribution, and interface wave generation. We then estimate the performance of a coherent phonon reflector with roughened interfaces. Our findings have novel implications for the design of phononic devices; in addition, our preliminary experimental results confirm the reduction in coherent phonon reflection at roughened interfaces...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} drive a system with an {{external}} input is a fundamental aspect of light-matter interaction. The coherent perfect absorption (CPA) phenomenon extends to the general multibeam interference phenomenology the well-known critical coupling concepts (Haus in Waves and fields in optoelectronics. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, 1984; Yariv and Yeh in Optical Electronics in Modern Communication. Oxford University Press, New York, 2007). The latter detail {{the conditions under which}} the energy of the input field is fed in full to the absorbing element. In a multi-port system, the relative phase of the incoming fields can yield the ultimate control of the absorption, from CPA to complete transparency (coherent perfect transparency, CPT), and also beyond, in amplifying regimes, to laser threshold control (Longhi in Phys Rev A 82 : 031801, 2010; Sun et al. in Phys Rev Lett 112 : 143903, 2014). This interferometric control of absorption can be employed to reach perfect energy feeding into nanoscale systems such as plasmonic nanoparticles (Noh et al. in Phys Rev Lett 108 (18) : 186805, 2012), and multi-port interference can be used to enhance the absorption when they are embedded in a strongly scattering system (Chong and Stone in Phys Rev Lett 107 (16) : 163901, 2011), with potential applications to nanoscale sensing. Here we review the two-port CPA in reference to photonic structures which can resonantly couple to the external fields. A revised two-port theory of CPA is illustrated, which relies on the Scattering Matrix formalism and is valid for all linear two-port systems with reciprocity. Through a semiclassical approach, treating two-port critical coupling conditions in a non-perturbative regime, it is demonstrated that the strong-coupling regime and the critical coupling condition can indeed coexist; in this situation, termed strong critical coupling (Zanotto et al. in Nature Phys 10 (11) : 830 - 834, 2014), all the incoming energy is converted into polaritons. Experimental results are presented, which clearly display the elliptical trace of absorption as function of input unbalance in a thin metallo-dielectric metamaterial, and verify polaritonic CPA in an intersubband polariton photonic crystal <b>membrane</b> <b>resonator.</b> Concluding remarks discuss the future perspectives of CPA with photonic structures...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a barrage of {{interest}} {{in recent years to}} marry the fields of nanomechanics and quantum optics. Mechanical systems provide sensitive and scalable architectures for sensing applications ranging from atomic force microscopy to gravity wave interferometry. Optical resonators driven by low noise lasers provide a quiet and well-understood means to read-out and manipulate mechanical motion, by way of the radiation pressure force. Taken to an extreme, a device consisting of a high-Q nanomechanical oscillator coupled to a high-finesse optical cavity may enable ground-state preparation of the mechanical element, thus paving the way for a new class of quantum technology based on chip-scale phononic devices coupled to optical photons. By way of mutual coupling to the optical field, this architecture may enable coupling of single phonons to real or artificial atoms, an enticing prospect because of the vast "quantum optics toolbox" already developed for cavity quantum electrodynamics. The first step towards these goals [...] - ground-state cooling of the mechanical element in a "cavity optomechanical" system [...] - has very recently been realized in a cryogenic setup. The work presented in this thesis describes an effort to extend this capability to a room temperature apparatus, so that the usual panoply of table-top optical/atomic physics tools can be brought to bear. This requires a mechanical oscillator with exceptionally low dissipation, as well as careful attention to extraneous sources of noise in both the optical and mechanical componentry. Our particular system is based on a high-Q, high-stress silicon nitride membrane coupled to a high-finesse Fabry-Perot cavity. The purpose of this thesis is to record in detail the procedure for characterizing/modeling the physical properties of the <b>membrane</b> <b>resonator,</b> the optical cavity, and their mutual interaction, as well as extraneous sources of noise related to multimode thermal motion of the oscillator, thermal motion of the cavity apparatus, optical absorption, and laser phase fluctuations. Our principle experimental result is the radiation pressure-based cooling of a high order, 4. 8 MHz drum mode of the membrane from room temperature to 100 mK (500 phonons).

40|$|High-stress Si 3 N 4 nanoresonators {{have become}} an {{attractive}} choice for electro- and optomechanical devices. <b>Membrane</b> <b>resonators</b> can achieve quality factor (Q) –frequency (f) products exceeding 1013 Hz, enabling (in principle) quantum coherent operation at room temperature. String-like beam resonators possess smaller Q × f products; however, on account of their significantly lower mass and mode density, they remain a canonical choice for precision force, mass, and charge sensing, and have recently enabled Heisenberg-limited position measurements at cryogenic temperatures. Here we explore two techniques to enhance the Q of a nanomechanical beam. The techniques relate to two main loss mechanisms: internal loss, which dominates for high aspect ratios and f ≲ 100 MHz, and radiation loss, which dominates for low aspect ratios and f ≳ 100 MHz. First, we show that by embedding a nanobeam in a 1 D phononic crystal (PnC), {{it is possible to}} localize its flexural motion and shield it against radiation loss. Using this method, we realize f > 100 MHz modes with Q ≈ 104, consistent with internal loss and contrasting sharply with unshielded beams of similar dimensions. We then study the Q × f product of high-order modes of millimeter-long nanobeams. Taking advantage of the mode-shape dependence of stress-induced “loss dilution”, we realize a f ≈ 4 MHz mode with Q × f ≈ 9 × 1012 Hz. Our results complement recent work on PnC-based “soft-clamping” of nanomembranes, in which mode localization is used to enhance loss dilution. Combining these strategies should enable ultra-low-mass nanobeam oscillators that operate deep in the quantum coherent regime at room temperature...|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{addresses}} {{two major}} fields. First, the dynamic measurement of displacement with {{a resolution of}} micrometers is considered. Second, {{the development of a}} new class of capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (cMUT) is performed. Within the first scope, an exemplary field of application, i. e. the gripper of a robotic handling system, has been chosen. The commonly employed sensor principles for these purposes are reviewed. In addition, a number of three sensor principles has been selected for an experimental investigation. These distance sensors work within a measuring range of 200 µm up to 3 mm and a resolution of a few micrometers was targeted. Their usability has been specified in terms of repeating accuracy (2 ̆ 2 Wiederholpräzision 2 ̆ 2). Going on from this preselection of sensor principles, the ultrasonic transducer has been chosen for further development. The state-of-the-art of ultrasonic transducers for air-borne ultrasound is outlined. The given drawbacks of the prevailing thickness mode resonators motivate the development of different transducer principles. One alternative is given by <b>membrane</b> <b>resonators.</b> Here, the ultrasound is generated by the electrostatic stimulation of the membrane, whereas the detection of ultrasound is performed by the measurement of changes in the capacitance of the transducer. Within this thesis it is shown that the microsystem technology offers advantageous possibilities to manufacture ultrasonic transducers with a number of new distinctive features. In particular, the technologies of surface micromachining were employed to develop a novel transducer set-up Since the fabrication of cMUT by means of microsystem technology emerged in 1994, two varying set-ups have been realized that differ from the present one. In contrast to those, the present set-up of a cMUT is particularly suitable for low voltage applications...|$|R
40|$|The quantum {{control of}} {{mechanical}} resonators requires {{the realization of}} exceptionally low dissipation in conjunction with strong nonlinear interactions. In this thesis, we demonstrate the simultaneous realization of both these features in ultrahigh quality factor silicon nitride membrane resonators, a promising new optomechanical platform in the emerging field of cavity optomechanics. The mechanical properties of the silicon nitride resonators are studied {{through a combination of}} spectroscopic and interferometric imaging techniques. We demonstrate ultrahigh quality factors of 5 x 107 and frequency-quality factor products of 1 x 1014 Hz corresponding to the largest values yet reported for mesoscopic membrane resonators, and an order of magnitude larger than what is required for room temperature quantum control. We perform a study of the limiting dissipation mechanisms as a function of resonator and substrate geometries and identify radiation loss through the supporting substrate as the dominant loss process. We proceed to alleviate radiation loss through the engineering of substrates with phononic bandgaps and present preliminary demonstrations of increased quality factors {{for a wide range of}} membrane modes. We also realize a two-mode parametric nonlinear process, and use it to demonstrate nondegenerate mechanical parametric amplification and two-mode thermomechanical noise squeezing. The observed phenomena show excellent agreement, over five orders of magnitude in displacement, with a two-mode model with the parametric coupling between the modes mediated by an excitation of the supporting substrate platform. The realization of a strong nonlinear interaction in a mechanical platform that is compatible with optomechanical cooling, room temperature quantum control and quantum limited detection is an important step towards the realization of non-classical mechanical states, the observation of entanglement between macroscopic mechanical degrees of freedom and quantum enhanced metrology. The last chapter of this thesis is unrelated to the rest of the work presented in it.

40|$|We create {{squeezed}} {{light by}} exploiting the quantum {{nature of the}} mechanical interaction between laser light and a <b>membrane</b> mechanical <b>resonator</b> embedded in an optical cavity. The radiation pressure shot noise (fluctuating optical force from quantum laser amplitude noise) induces resonator motion well above that of thermally driven motion. This motion imprints a phase shift on the laser light, hence correlating the amplitude and phase noise, a consequence of which is optical squeezing. We experimentally demonstrate strong and continuous optomechanical squeezing of 1. 7 +/- 0. 2 dB below the shot noise level. The peak level of squeezing measured near the mechanical resonance is well described by a model whose parameters are independently calibrated and that includes thermal motion of the membrane with no other classical noise sources.

40|$|Abstract The {{modelling}} {{strategy and}} simulation of flexible components of MEMS are {{addressed in this}} article. A newly developed Cosserat Rod Element (CRE) approach is employed to model the nonlinear dynamic equations of motion for micro resonators. Models constructed using this approach seek to capture the most significant characteristics of a microstructure in a few variables governed by a few ordinary differential equations of motion. A Three-dimensional nonlinear dynamic model with a six-degree-of-freedom for a resonator that comprises a <b>resonator</b> <b>membrane</b> supported by four flexible beams is generated. For illustration, the nonlinear dynamical responses of the resonator with/without external forces and/or torques have been presented through numerical simulations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{acoustic}} properties of a duct resonator tuned by an electro-active <b>membrane.</b> The <b>resonator</b> {{takes the form}} of a side-branch cavity which is attached to a rigid duct and covered by a pre-stretched Dielectric Elastomer (DE) in the neck area. A three-dimensional, analytical model based on the sub-structuring approach is developed to characterize the complex structure-acoustic coupling between the DE membrane and its surrounding acoustic media. We show that such resonator provides sound attenuation in the medium frequency range mainly by means of sound reflection, as a result of the membrane vibration. The prediction accuracy of the proposed model is validated against experimental test. The pre-stretched DE membrane with fixed edges responds to applied voltage change with a varying inner stress and, by the same token, its natural frequency and vibrational response can be tuned to suit particular frequencies of interest. The peaks in the transmission loss (TL) curves can be shifted towards lower frequencies when the voltage applied to the DE membrane is increased. Through simulations on the effect of increasing the voltage level, the TL shifting mechanism and its possible tuning range are analyzed. This paves the way for applying such resonator device for adaptive-passive noise control. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a review and fundamental physical interpretation for the effective densities and moduli of acoustic metamaterials. We introduce the terminology of hidden force and hidden source of volume: the effective density or modulus is negative when the hidden force or source of volume is larger than, and operates in antiphase to, respectively, the force or volume change {{that would be}} obtained in their absence. We demonstrate this ansatz for some established acoustic metamaterials with elements based on <b>membranes,</b> Helmholtz <b>resonators,</b> springs and masses. The hidden force for membrane-based acoustic metamaterials, for instance, is the force from the membrane tension. The hidden source for a Helmholtz-resonator-based metamaterial is the extra air volume injected from the resonator cavity. We also explain the analogous concepts for pure mass-and-spring systems, in which case hidden forces can arise from masses and springs fixed inside other masses, whereas hidden sources - more aptly termed hidden expanders of displacement in this case - can arise from light rigid trusses coupled to extra degrees of freedom for mechanical motion such as the case of coupling to masses that move {{at right angles to}} the wave-propagation direction. This overall picture {{provides a}} powerful tool for conceptual understanding and design of new acoustic metamaterials, and avoids common pitfalls involved in determining the effective parameters of such materials.

40|$|The {{electrical}} actuation of suspended <b>membrane</b> nanomechanical <b>resonators</b> {{incorporated into}} a laser interferometer displacement setup was investigated. Graphene and MoS 2 membranes {{have been used to}} show electrical actuation of both metals and semiconductors. The method to fabricate devices was optimized and the properties of the fabricated devices are documented in order to make future device farication easier when speci?c properties are required. The ?rst experiment performed with the electrical actuation was done in order to investigate the frequency tuning the of the 2 D resonators. Resonance frequencies in the range of 15 - 55 MHz are observed without frequency tuning, where variations are due to differences in diameter and thickness of the suspended drums and the built-in tension. Applying a DC voltage caused both a decrease and an increase in the resonance frequency, depending on the device and the magnitude of the voltage. A maximum (increasing) frequency tuning sensitivity of 7. 62 MHz/V was achieved. Furthermore, the model of interactions in 2 D circular membrane due to electric actuation and DC gate voltage tuning in the linear resonator regime is compared to the measurement results. This comparison gives insight in the interaction between electrostatic spring softening and mechanically induced strain in membranes with different properties. The investigated model was insuf?cient to explain the measured frequency changes due to the applied DC voltages.
