5000|$|Magnetic 3D {{bioprinting}} {{can be used}} {{to screen}} for cardiovascular toxicity, which accounts for 30% of drug withdrawals [...] Vascular smooth muscle cells are magnetically printed into 3D rings to mimic blood vessels that can contract and dilate. This system could potentially replace experiments using ex vivo tissue, which are costly and yield few data per experiment. Furthermore, magnetic 3D bioprinting can use human cells to approximate a human in vivo response better than with an animal model. This has been demonstrated by the bioassay which combines the benefits of 3D bioprinting in building tissue-like structures for study with the speed of <b>magnetic</b> <b>printing.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractA micromagnetic {{analysis}} of <b>magnetic</b> <b>printing</b> onto an exchange-coupled composite (ECC) media was performed with a data signal density of over 2 Tb/in 2. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>printing</b> is a promising method of recording a servo signal onto an ECC media with data signal densities beyond 2 Tb/in 2. The printing performance {{was close to}} 100 % at servo signal densities of 1. 0 and 1. 7 Tb/in 2. There was an optimum intergrain coupling strength in ECC media at each servo signal density, and as the servo signal density increased, the optimum intergrain coupling strength became weaker...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWith the {{increase}} in recording density and capacity of hard-disk drives (HDD), high speed, high precision and low cost servo writing method has become an issue in HDD industry. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>printing</b> was proposed as the ultimate solution for this issue [1 - 3]. There {{are two types of}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>printing</b> methods, which are ‘Bit Printing (BP) ’ and ‘Edge Printing (EP) ’. BP method is conducted by applying external field whose direction is vertical to the plane of both master disk (Master) and perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR) media (Slave). On the other hand, EP method is conducted by applying external field toward down track direction of both master and slave. In BP for bit length shorter than 100 nm, the SNR of perpendicular anisotropic master was higher than isotropic master. And the SNR of EP for the bit length shorter than 50 nm was demonstrated...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Magnetic</b> striped <b>prints</b> were {{expensive}} to produce; each print {{cost at least}} twice as much as a print with a standard optical soundtrack only. Furthermore, these striped prints wore out faster than optical prints and caused more problems in use, such as flakes of oxide clogging the replay heads. Due to these problems, and also because many cinemas never installed the necessary playback equipment, <b>magnetic</b> sound <b>prints</b> started to be made in small quantities for [...] "roadshow" [...] screenings only, with the main release using standard mono optical sound prints. As time went by roadshow screenings were increasingly made using 70 mm film, and the use of striped 35 mm prints declined further. Many CinemaScope films from the 1960s and 1970s were never released in stereo at all. Finally the introduction in 1976 of Dolby Stereo, which provided a similar performance to striped <b>magnetic</b> <b>prints</b> but more reliably and at a far lower cost, caused the 4-track magnetic system to become totally obsolete.|$|R

40|$|Influence of {{recording}} filed direction on transition noise of stacked media was investigated by using <b>magnetic</b> <b>printing</b> for recording and MFM images. Stray field fluctuation along the cross-track {{direction in the}} transition area and dispersion of the transition position of the recorded medium decreased as the applied field angle increased from the perpendicular direction. This shows that the transition noise decreases with increasing in-plane component of the recording filed.

5000|$|Although {{magnetic}} audio was {{of excellent}} quality {{it also had}} significant disadvantages. <b>Magnetic</b> sound <b>prints</b> were expensive, 35mm <b>magnetic</b> <b>prints</b> cost roughly {{twice as much as}} optical sound prints, whilst 70mm prints could cost up to 15 times as much. Furthermore, they wore out faster and were also prone to damage and erasure over time. Because of the high cost of installing magnetic sound reproduction equipment only a minority of movie theaters ever installed it and the magnetic soundheads needed considerable maintenance to keep their performance up to standard. As a consequence the use of the Cinemascope 35mm four-track magnetic sound format decreased significantly {{during the course of the}} 1960s and effectively ended with the success of the Dolby Stereo optical stereo format in the late 1970s. However 70mm film continued to be used for prestigious [...] "roadshow" [...] screenings until the introduction of digital sound on 35mm film in the early 1990s removed one of the major justifications for using this expensive format.|$|R

5000|$|Unlike the {{original}} version of Sensurround, Mod-II (and later, Mod-III) were only for use with mono optical soundtracks. Due {{to the use of}} dbx Type-II noise reduction, MCA eliminated the standard Academy Filter traditionally used on optical prints, thus giving Sensurround an increased frequency response of 16 Hz to 16 kHz and a dynamic range of 86 dB, superior to 70mm <b>magnetic</b> <b>prints</b> of the time. It also allowed a mono optical track to have surround sound effects and MCA began to market the system to other studios and producers as a truly high-fidelity sound and special effects system. Dolby Stereo optical was just beginning to become known in the industry and MCA felt they had a viable competing format. While Warner Bros. and Paramount seriously considered adopting the system, in the end only Universal Studios ever released films using the process.

5000|$|... 35mm 4-Track Magnetic with Optical Track (magoptical): This type of Sensurround print was not usable as a mono optical print. Unlike {{standard}} magoptical prints, {{in which}} the optical track was a mono version of the magnetic stereo tracks, the optical track on <b>magnetic</b> Sensurround <b>prints</b> contained only the control tones. If played as a standard optical print, only the 25 Hz and 35 Hz control tones would be heard. To control the Sensurround System and its volume levels, control tones recorded on the optical track varied from −14 to −6 dB below 100% modulation and activation of the Sensurround System occurred at −16 dB. For program sounds applied to the Sensurround Horns, Track-2 (Center Front) was used, with its level and timing controlled by the 25 Hz control tone. For magnetic playback in mono, Track-2 (Center Front) could be used because Earthquake was mixed with mono dialogue, unlike most stereo films up to that time. For 4-Track equipped theaters that wanted to run Earthquake without Sensurround, the standard 12 kHz CinemaScope switching signal was recorded on Track-4 (surround). Because no noise reduction system was used on <b>magnetic</b> <b>prints</b> at the time, and due to the lower technical performance of the surround channels magnetic track, this switching system was implemented by 20th Century Fox during CinemaScope's development to reduce the hiss and system noise heard from the surround speakers. For Earthquake run in the United States, the surround speakers were disconnected and the Sensurround system was relied upon to produce all the surround sound effects; Track-4 was not used nor even connected to the Sensurround Integrator. In Europe, the surround track {{was used in the}} normal manner, being controlled by the Sensurround Integrator like the other magnetic channels.|$|R

5000|$|Fox {{originally}} intended CinemaScope films to use magnetic stereo sound only, and although in certain areas, such as Los Angeles and New York City, {{the vast majority}} of theaters were equipped for 4-track magnetic sound (4-track magnetic sound achieving nearly 90 percent penetration of theaters in the greater Los Angeles area) the owners of many smaller theaters were dissatisfied with contractually having to install expensive three- or four-track magnetic stereo, and because of the technical nature of sound installations, drive-in theaters had trouble presenting stereophonic sound at all. Due to these conflicts, and because other studios were starting to release anamorphic prints with standard optical soundtracks, Fox revoked their policy of stereo-only presentations in 1957, and added a half-width optical soundtrack, while keeping the magnetic tracks for those theaters that were able to present their films with stereophonic sound. These so-called [...] "mag-optical" [...] prints provided a somewhat sub-standard optical sound and were also expensive to produce.
