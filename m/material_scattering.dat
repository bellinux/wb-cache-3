That is, quantum mechanics plays a small, essentially negligible, role. The very hard radiation from synchrotron radiation sources must be treated quantum mechanically, but that is more a performance than a design matter. In all devices, the multiple scattering of beams from gas molecules is a quantum effect, but by making the vacuum good enough, {{and that is exactly}} what is done in practice, the effect can be made negligible...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonic {{attenuation}} is {{a useful}} tool in characterizing the damage state of different materials. The attenuation coefficients for the incident longitudinal and transverse waves are both derived from the scattering {{cross section of the}} <b>material.</b> <b>Scattering</b> cross section is defined as the ratio of the scattered energy to the incident energy. The incident wave field can be scattered at inclusions, voids and material defects; there is also grain boundary scattering in polycrystalline materials. For accurate material characterization, it is important to distinguish between the different types of scattering and to relate the attenuation to its appropriate source. This study first solves the single scatterer problem using either the Born approximation (for difficult scatterer shapes and for anisotropic scatterers), or the exact solution (in cases where it is necessary to provide an accurate description of the viscoelastic behavior of the surrounding effective medium). Multiple scattering effects are investigated by a differential self-consistent scheme and a self-consistent scheme. Both multiple scattering approaches are applicable for each single scatterer solution. The differential self-consistent scheme describes the scattering cross section dependent on the volume fraction of the scatterers, and is restricted to low volume fractions and materials, where the surrounding material is clearly distinguished from the inclusions. The self-consistent scheme is applicable to high volume fractions of inclusions as well as to polycrystalline materials, where the distinction between surrounding material and inclusions is not possible.

40|$|X-ray {{binary star}} systems are unique {{laboratories}} in which astronomers may observationally refine or confirm some {{basic principles of}} astrophysics. Observations of these systems provide information about the geometry, composition, and other physical conditions existing in the accretion structures present in these binaries. The orbital inclination of the binary system may also be inferred from these observations. ^ The High Speed Photometer (HSP) {{was one of the}} four axial instruments on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) from April, 1990 to December, 1993. We used this instrument to observe the X-ray binary systems HD 153919, Vela XR- 1 and Cyg XR- 1 both photometrically and polarimetrically {{for the first time ever}} in the ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths. The photometric and polarimetric light curves of each target have been constructed by measuring the flux and linear polarization in several different wavelength bands, at several different phases in one binary orbit. The UV radiation is believed to originate closer to the compact secondary star, so that observations in these wavelengths enable astronomers to investigate a different region of the gas streams between the stars than could be done from ground based observatories. ^ The results we obtained from these first-ever UV polarimetric observations provide striking confirmation of Rayleigh (recombined <b>material)</b> <b>scattering</b> from gas streams and stellar wind in these systems. This conclusion is based on the dependence of polarimetric variability with wavelength. There is also strong evidence for the existence of polarized bremsstrahlung radiation in the systems with a neutron star secondary. In addition to these results, we derived new estimates for the orbital inclination, location of the scattering structure relative to the line of centers, and orientation of the orbital angular momentum for the system (and associated confidence intervals for each parameter). These results have been compared to previously published ground based observations. ...|$|E
40|$|Sol-gel {{matrices}} {{may be used}} {{to immobilise}} enzymes, facilitating retention of the catalyst while allowing a flow of substrates and products through the matrix. Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB), a commonly used industrial enzyme, has been shown to have a prolonged catalytic life and enhanced activity when encapsulated in these sol-gel materials. However, the molecular basis for this effect had yet to be elucidated. This study investigated the effect of encapsulating CALB in sol-gel matrices by comparison of CALB in solution with its encapsulated form. Use of complementary techniques revealed the presence of complex interactions between the enzyme and the evolving sol-gel material. 29 Si Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements demonstrated that CALB influenced sol-gel structure by altering silica speciation. Inclusion of CALB also altered the mesoporosity of the matrices as determined using nitrogen sorption and electron microscopy. Correlation of activity assays with 29 Si speciation changes indicated that the catalytic activity of the enzyme in solution was directly involved in sol-gel hydrolysis and condensation reactions. Increased specific activity of CALB in the sol-gel aqueous precursor solution resulted in measurable changes in the gel structure of matrices containing 3. 1 mg of CALB/ml of gel. Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) was used to examine the structure of CALB in solution. The influence of the sol-gel reactants glycerol, sodium fluoride and isopropanol upon the radius of gyration of CALB in solution was determined. SANS was also employed in an investigation of encapsulated CALB molecules which utilised contrast matching of the sol-gel matrix. However, contrast variation studies found that the match point for the silica matrix, both with and without enzyme present, was lower than predicted (~ 35 % vol% D 2 O). Consequently, the contrast match point of the protein was close to that of the encapsulating <b>material.</b> <b>Scattering</b> from the encapsulated protein at this point was therefore minimal; {{it is clear that the}} contrast match point of the protein should be moved through in vivo deuteration in future experiments of this type.

40|$|Fabrics are {{essential}} to our everyday lives. Recently advances in physically based rendering techniques and computing power {{have made it possible}} to accurately model and reproduce their appearance. This has led to many applications in not only computer graphics but also other fields including industrial design, retail, and entertainment. Traditionally, fabrics are treated as infinitely thin 2 D sheets. These surfacebased reflectance models, although being conceptually simple, have insufficient power to describe a fabric's small-scale 3 D geometries, such as disorganized layers of fibers in felts. Thus, these models cannot accurately reproduce the fabric's thickness and fuzziness, limiting the level of realism they can offer. In contrast, volumetric models, which has recently been very successful in modeling fabric appearance, explicitly express those fiber-level structures, upon which greatly varying visual effects, from anisotropic highlights to deep textures, emerge automatically. However, volumetric models are generally difficult to build: one would need to specify spatially varying optical properties at high (e. g., micron) resolutions. This dissertation presents a family of algorithms that introduce a brand new way to automatically build and efficiently render volumetric fabric models at micron-resolution. These models capture rich details at fiber-level, yielding highly realistic renderings even under extreme close-ups. Our first contribution tackles the challenge of automated creation of high fidelity fabric models. Our method uses volume imaging techniques to measure a fabric's detailed structural information. Such information is then combined with a photograph to form a complete model through an appearance matching process. The resulting model offers fabric renderings with unprecedented quality. CT scanning fabric samples can be highly time consuming. Our second contribution aims for creating volumetric models for woven fabrics with complex designs under minimal measurement cost. Our approach starts with building a small database of cloth samples with elementary weave patterns. Then, given an input pattern, a volumetric synthesis stage is performed to form the final volume by copying contents from the database while keeping visible artifacts (such as seams) minimized. Fabric models created by this method have been used by textile researchers at Rhode Island School of Design to preview the appearances of their designs. Our third work focuses on efficient rendering of high-resolution fabric volumes. Based on the observation that these volumes contain repeated structures (i. e., multiple instances of the same content in the database), we precompute light transport information for those structures, and a single precomputation can be reused for many designs synthesized from the same database. During the rendering process, the precomputed information is modularly combined through a Monte Carlo Matrix Inversion (MCMI) framework. This method has accelerated the rendering of thick fabrics by an order of magnitude. Finally, we switch gears and introduce high-order similarity relations to computer graphics. This theory originates in applied physics and studies when two sets of <b>material</b> <b>scattering</b> parameters would lead to identical appearance. We introduce a numerical algorithm to utilize this theory in its general high-order form. The practical usefulness of our method is demonstrated using forward and inverse rendering of translucent media. The approaches presented in this dissertation have created fabric renderings with unprecedented fidelity. Remaining challenges include developing more general synthesis technique to support a wider range of fabric structures (such as knitworks) as well as finding more powerful light transport models and inverse rendering algorithms so that the rendered fabrics match photographs under a wide combination of viewing and lighting configurations. We also believe the techniques introduced in this dissertation can provide valuable insights for developing appearance modeling techniques for general material beyond fabrics...|$|E

40|$|Thermoelectric devices {{with the}} ability to convert {{rejected}} heat into electricity are widely used in nowadays technology. Several studies have been done to improve the efficiency of these devices. However, because of the strong correlation between thermoelectric properties (electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity including lattice and electron counterpart), improving ZT has always been a challenging task. In this study, thermal conductivity of group IV-based binary and ternary alloys such as SiGe, SiSn, GeSn, and SiGeSn has been studied. Phonon Boltzmann Transport Equation has been solved in the relaxation time approximation including intrinsic and extrinsic (in the presence of boundary and interfaces in the low-dimensional <b>material)</b> <b>scattering</b> mechanisms. Full phonon dispersion based on the Adiabatic Bond Charge model has been calculated for Si, Ge, and Sn. Virtual crystal approximation has been adapted to calculate the dispersion of SiGe, SiSn, GeSn, and SiGeSn. Two approaches have been introduced to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity of the materials under study. First, alloying results in a significant reduction of thermal conductivity. But, this reduction has been limited by the mass disorder scattering in the composition range of 0. 2 to 0. 8. Second, nanostructuring technique has been proposed to further reduce the thermal conductivity. Our study shows that, due to the atomic mass difference which gives rise to the elastic mass scattering mechanism, SiSn has the lowest thermal conductivity among the other materials under study. SiSn achieved the thermal conductivity of 1. 18 W/mK at 10 nm at the Sn composition of 0. 18, which is the experimentally stable state of SiSn. The results show that SiSn alloys have the lowest conductivity (3 W/mK) of all the bulk alloys, more than two times lower than SiGe, attributed to the larger difference in mass between the two constituents. In addition, this study demonstrates that thin films offer an additional reduction in thermal conductivity, reaching around 1 W/mK in 20 nm SiSn, GeSn, and ternary SiGeSn films, which is close to the conductivity of amorphous SiO_ 2. This value is lower than the thermal conductivity of SiGe at 10 nm which is 1. 43 W/mK. Having lattice thermal conductivity reduced, electron transport has been studied by solving Boltzmann Transport Equation under low electric field including elastic and inelastic scattering mechanisms. Rode 2 ̆ 7 s iterative method has been applied to the model for obtaining perturbation of distribution function under a low electric field. This study shows that nanostructuring and alloying can reduce κ_ph without significantly changing the other parameters. This is because of the phonon characteristics in solids in which MFP of phonons is much larger than those of electrons, which gives us the possibility of phonons confinement without altering electrons transport. Thermoelectric properties of SiGe in the bulk and nanostructure form have been studied to calculate ZT {{in a wide range of}} temperatures. The results demonstrate that ZT reaches the value of 1. 9 and 1. 58 at the temperatures of 1200 K and 1000 K respectively, with the Ge composition of 0. 2 and carrier concentration of 5 × 10 ^ 19 cm^- 3 at 10 nm thickness. This model can be applied to SiSn and other binary and ternary alloys, to calculate the improved ZT. Hence, we conclude that group IV alloys containing Sn have the potential for high-efficiency TE energy conversion...|$|E
