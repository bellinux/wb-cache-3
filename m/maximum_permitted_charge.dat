5000|$|On February 15, 2006, federal Judge David Bunning sentenced Davis 30 months-—the <b>maximum</b> the <b>charges</b> <b>permitted.</b> Bunning {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} the sentence by citing several factors including Davis' abuse of trust (which he likened to a public corruption case), the division it caused in the community between Davis' supporters and detractors. He also noted an extended sentence would give Davis the opportunity to [...] "do some good" [...] for his fellow inmates and to address his gambling addiction.

40|$|Ground {{vibrations}} {{originating from}} bench blasting may cause damage to slopes, structures, and underground workings {{in close proximity}} to an operating open-pit mine. It is important to monitor and predict ground vibration levels induced by blasting and to take measures to reduce their hazardous effects. The aims of this paper are to determine the weaker protection objects by comparatively studying bench blasting induced vibrations obtained at surface and in an underground tunnel in an open-pit mine and thus to seek vibration control methods to protect engineering objects at the site. Vibrations arising from measurement devices at surface and in an underground tunnel at the Zijinshan Open-Pit Mine were obtained. Comparative analysis of the peak particle velocities shows that, in the greatest majority of cases, surface values are higher than underground values for the same vibration distance. The transmission laws of surface and underground vibrations were established {{depending on the type of}} rock mass, the explosive charge, and the distance. Compared with the Chinese Safety Regulations for Blasting (GB 6722 - 2014), the bench blasting induced vibrations would not currently cause damage to the underground tunnel. According to the maximum allowable peak particle velocities for different objects, the <b>permitted</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>charges</b> per delay are obtained to reduce damage to these objects at different distances...|$|R

50|$|The line {{is divided}} into signal blocks of about 1,500 metres (~1 mi), the {{boundaries}} of which are marked by blue boards printed with a yellow triangle. Dashboard instruments show the <b>maximum</b> <b>permitted</b> speed for a train's current block, {{as well as a}} target speed based on the profile of the line ahead. The <b>maximum</b> <b>permitted</b> speed is based on factors such as the proximity of trains ahead (with steadily decreasing <b>maximum</b> <b>permitted</b> speeds in blocks closer {{to the rear of the}} next train), junction placement, speed restrictions, the top speed of the train and distance from the end of LGV route. Trains at high-speed take several kilometres to stop. Since trains will require more than one signal block to slow down, drivers are alerted to reduce speed gradually, several blocks before any required stop.|$|R
