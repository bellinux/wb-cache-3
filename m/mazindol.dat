5000|$|Given {{the data}} in the above table, one might also be {{interested}} in making the desoxy-mazindol analog. The synthesis for this is facile.

50|$|<b>Mazindol</b> is a {{sympathomimetic}} amine, {{which is}} similar to amphetamine. It stimulates the central nervous system, which increases heart rate and blood pressure, and decreases appetite. Sympathomimetic anoretics (appetite suppressants) are used in the short-term treatment of obesity. Their appetite-reducing effect tends to decrease after a few weeks of treatment. Because of this, these medicines are useful only during the first few weeks of a weight-loss program.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{mechanism}} of action of the sympathomimetics {{in the treatment of}} obesity is not fully known, these medications have pharmacological effects similar to those of amphetamines. Like other sympathomimetic appetite suppressants, <b>mazindol</b> is thought to act as a reuptake inhibitor of norepinephrine. In addition, it inhibits dopamine and serotonin reuptake. The recommended dosage is 2 mg per day for 90 days in patients 40 kg overweight and under; 4 mg a day in patients more than 50 kg overweight; separated into two doses separated by a 12-hour window between each 2 mg dose.|$|E
50|$|Phencyclidine {{and related}} {{drugs such as}} benocyclidine, tenocyclidine, ketamine, and {{dizocilpine}} (MK-801), {{have been shown to}} inhibit the reuptake of the monoamine neurotransmitters. They appear to exert their reuptake inhibition by binding to vaguely characterized allosteric sites on each of the respective monoamine transporters. Benztropine, <b>mazindol,</b> and vanoxerine also bind to these sites and have similar properties. In addition to their high affinity for the main site of the monoamine transporters, several competitive transporter substrates such as cocaine and indatraline have lower affinity for these allosteric sites as well.|$|E
50|$|Preparation starts by {{reaction}} of a substituted benzoylbenzoic acid (1) with ethylenediamine The product 3 can be rationalized {{as being an}} aminal from the initially formed monoamide 2. This is then subjected to reduction with LiAlH4 and-without isolation-air oxidation. Reduction probably proceeds to the mixed aminal/carbinolamine 4; such a product {{would be expected to}} be in equilibrium with the alternate aminal 5. The latter would be expected to predominate because of the greater stability of aldehyde aminals over the corresponding ketone derivatives. Air oxidation of the tetrahydroimidazole to the imidazoline will then remove 5 from the equilibrium. There is thus obtained the anorectic agent <b>mazindol</b> (6).|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{drugs have}} DRI action {{and have been}} or are used clinically specifically for this property: amineptine, dexmethylphenidate, difemetorex, fencamfamine, lefetamine, levophacetoperane, medifoxamine, mesocarb, methylphenidate, nomifensine, pipradrol, prolintane, and pyrovalerone. The following drugs are or have been used clinically and possess only weak DRI action, {{which may or may}} not be clinically-relevant: adrafinil, armodafinil, bupropion, <b>mazindol,</b> modafinil, nefazodone, sertraline, and sibutramine. The following drugs are or have been clinically used but only coincidentally have DRI properties: benzatropine, diphenylpyraline, etybenzatropine, ketamine, nefopam, pethidine (meperidine), and tripelennamine. The following are a selection of some particularly notably abused DRIs: cocaine, ketamine, MDPV, naphyrone, and phencyclidine (PCP). Amphetamines, including amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA, cathinone, methcathinone, mephedrone, and methylone, are all DRIs as well, but are distinct in that they also behave, and potentially more potently as dopamine releasing agents (DRAs) (it should be noted that due to Yerkes-Dodson's law, 'more potently stimulated' may not equal more optimally functionally stimulated). There are very distinct differences in the mode of action between dopamine releasers/substrates & dopamine re-uptake inhibitors; the former are functionally entropy-driven (i.e. relating to hydrophobicity) and the latter are enthalpy-driven (i.e. relating conformational change). Reuptake inhibitors such as cocaine induce hyperpolarization of cloned human DAT upon oocytes that are naturally found on neurons, whereas releasing agents induce de-polarization of the neuron membrane.|$|E

A. de C. V., Mexico City, Mexico; 6 Sección de Estudios de Posgrado e Investigación, Escuela Superior de Medicina, Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Mexico City, Mexico Background: The role of dopaminergic {{system in}} the {{development}} of rheumatoid arthritis-related pain, a major symptom in this disease, has not been explored. Therefore, the antinociceptive effect of <b>mazindol,</b> a dopamine uptake inhibitor, was evaluated in a model of complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) -induced arthritis. Furthermore, as {{studies have shown that the}} dopaminergic system regulates bone metabolism, the effect of <b>mazindol</b> on bone mass and microarchitecture was determined. Methods: Adult ICR male mice received intra-articular injections of either CFA or saline into the right knee joint every week. Spontaneous pain-like behaviors (flinching and guarding) and locomotor activity were assessed at day 26 post-first CFA, following which, a single intraperitoneally (i. p.) administered dose of <b>mazindol</b> was given (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg). Then, the antinociceptive effect of a repeated administration of 3 mg/kg <b>mazindol</b> (daily, i. p.; day 15 –day 26) was evaluated. Additionally, at day 26, the participation of D 1 -like, D 2 -like or opioid receptors in the antinociceptive effect of <b>mazindol</b> was evaluated. The effect of <b>mazindol</b> on bone density and microarchitecture was evaluated by micro-computed tomography. Results: Acute administration of <b>mazindol</b> decreased the spontaneous pain-like behaviors in a dose-dependent manner without reducing the knee edema. However, <b>mazindol</b> at 10 mg/kg significantly increased the locomotor activity; therefore, 3 mg/kg <b>mazindol</b> was used for further studies. Repeated administration of 3 mg/kg <b>mazindol</b> significantly decreased the pain-like behaviors without modifying locomotor activity. The antinociceptive effect of <b>mazindol</b> was blocked by administration of a D 2 -like receptor antagonist (haloperidol), but not by administration of D 1 -like receptor antagonist (SCH 23390) or an opioid receptor antagonist (naloxone). Repeated administration of <b>mazindol</b> did not significantly modify the density and microarchitecture of periarticular bone of the arthritic and nonarthritic knee joints. Conclusion: Results suggest that <b>mazindol</b> via D 2 -like receptors has an antinociceptive role in mice with CFA-induced knee arthritis without modifying the bone health negatively.

40|$|<b>Mazindol</b> (5 -hydroxy- 5 -p-chlorophenyl- 2, 3 -dihydro- 5 H-isoindole) {{although}} not chemically {{related to the}} phenylethylamine group, shows a pharmacological profile {{similar to that of}} amphetamines. in rats these anorectic drugs enhance dopamine (DA) turnover, which is the mechanism that causes anorexia. It has been hypothesized that amphetamine causes a long-lasting depletion of DA, a decrease of dopaminergic transport pumps and nerve terminal degeneration increasing. These actions provide a cellular environment encouraging the autoxidation of DA that may lead to lipid peroxidation and neuronal damage. Considering that both drugs may cause neuronal damage by oxidative mechanisms, this study was conducted to investigate the action of <b>mazindol</b> and methamphetamine on brain cell antioxidant defense system and to investigate whether animal age is important in the antioxidant response to chronic anorectic administration. the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), as well as the total glutathione (GSH) content in brains of rats, were measured. the animals (2 groups with 5 and 18 months old) were treated for 5 months (i. p.) with <b>mazindol</b> (10 mg/kg body weight/day), methamphetamine (2. 5 mg/kg body weight/day) or saline. the results obtained showed no differences between SOD, CAT, GPx activities and GSH content in the brain of animals treated with saline compared with both drugs, either in 10 -month or 23 -month groups. On the other hand, brain total GSH content of old animals was found to be lower than that from young ones, independent of the treatment.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that cocaine and <b>mazindol</b> bind to sep-arate sites on the dopamine transporter. In the present study, we address this issue by examining the inhibition by <b>mazindol</b> of the binding of [3 H]WIN 35, 428 ([3 H] 2 b-carbomethyoxy- 3 b-(4 -fluorophenyl) -tropane), a phenyltropane analog of cocaine, and the inhibition by WIN 35, 428 of [3 H]mazindol binding to the cloned human dopamine transporter expressed in C 6 glioma cells. The design involved the construction of inhibition curves at six widely different radioligand levels, enabling the distinction between the nonlinear hyperbolic competition (i. e., negative allosteric) model and the competitive (i. e., mutually exclusive binding) model. Nonlinear computer curve-fitting analysis indi-cated no difference in the goodness of fit between the two models; the negative allosteric model indicated an extremely high allosteric constant of; $ 100, which practically equates to the competitive model. The present results suggest that com-plex interactions reported between cocaine and <b>mazindol</b> in inhibiting dopamine transport are beyond the level of ligand recognition.

40|$|Obesity is {{a disease}} of excess {{adiposity}} affecting> 17 % of men and > 20 % of women in Britain. Clinically, it is defined by a Body Mass Index (BMI, kg/m 2) of 2 : 30. Obesity is a confounding factor that promotes insulin resistance, hyperinsulinaemia and type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes accounts for > 90 % of all cases of diabetes, with a prevalence of 2 - 6 % of adults in most western societies, a majority of which are overweight or obese. Weight loss in obese patients {{reduces the risk of}} developing diabetes by > 50 %. This thesis has investigated the first part of a two-stage therapeutic intervention against obesity in which adipose tissue lipolysis will be combined with increased energy expenditure: the approach is also designed to consider agents that will benefit glycaemic control in coexistent obesity and diabetes by improving insulin sensitivity. Rodent and human in vitro models of adipocyte biology and skeletal muscle have been developed, characterised and evaluated. They include isolated epididymal and parametrial adipocytes of lean and obese diabetic ob/ob mice, cultured 3 T 3 -Ll preadipocytes, isolated human omental and subcutaneous adipocytes and rat L 6 cultured muscle cells. Compounds investigated for anti-obesity and anti-diabetic properties include M 2 (sibutramine metabolite), 3 -guanidinopropionic acid and <b>mazindol.</b> In vivo studies were undertaken to investigate these compounds further in lean and ob/ob mice. In vivo studies indicated that M 2 and 3 -guanidinopropionic acid reduced body weight gain in ob/ob mice. The three compounds increased lipolysis in adipocytes isolated from lean and ob/ob mice and human adipose depots. The direct action of these compounds was mediated via a pathway involving the f 3 adrenoceptors and components of the lipolytic signalling pathway, including protein kinase A and p 38 MAP kinase. In addition, M 2 and <b>mazindol</b> were capable of increasing glucose uptake into insulin sensitive tissues. M 2 and <b>mazindol</b> can act directly on adipose tissue and skeletal muscle to increase glucose uptake via a pathway involving new protein synthesis and activation of the glucose transporters. The M 2 -stimulated pathway is activated by the conversion of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate by phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase. Thus, M 2, <b>mazindol</b> and 3 -GPA showed pharmacodynamic properties which suggested they might be potential therapeutic treatments for obesity and diabetes...|$|E
