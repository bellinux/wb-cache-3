5000|$|A {{production}} packer {{is designed}} to grip and seal against the casing ID. Gripping is accomplished with <b>metal</b> <b>wedges</b> called [...] "slips." [...] These components have sharpened, carburized teeth that dig into the metal of the casing. Sealing is accomplished with large, cylindrical rubber elements. In situations where the sealed pressure is very high (above 5,000 psi), metal rings are used {{on either side of}} the elements to prevent the rubber from extruding.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} theoretically and numerically {{the efficiency of}} energy coupling from a plasmon generated by a grating coupler {{at one of the}} interfaces of a <b>metal</b> <b>wedge</b> into the plasmonic eigenmode (i. e., symmetric or quasisymmetric plasmon) experiencing nanofocusing in the wedge. Thus the energy efficiency of energy coupling into metallic nanofocusing structure is analyzed. Two different nanofocusing structures with the <b>metal</b> <b>wedge</b> surrounded by a uniform dielectric (symmetric structure) and with the <b>metal</b> <b>wedge</b> enclosed between a substrate and a cladding with different dielectricpermittivities (asymmetric structure) are considered by means of the geometrical optics (adiabatic) approximation. It is demonstrated that the efficiency of the energy coupling from the plasmon generated by the grating into the symmetric or quasisymmetric plasmon experiencing nanofocusing may vary between ∼ 50 % to ∼ 100 %. In particular, even a very small difference (of ∼ 1 %– 2 %) between the permittivities of the substrate and the cladding may result in {{a significant increase in the}} efficiency of the energy coupling (from ∼ 50 % up to ∼ 100 %) into the plasmon experiencing nanofocusing. Distinct beat patterns produced by the interference of the symmetric (quasisymmetric) and antisymmetric (quasiantisymmetric) plasmons are predicted and analyzed with significant oscillations of the magnetic and electric field amplitudes at both the <b>metal</b> <b>wedge</b> interfaces. Physical interpretations of the predicted effects are based upon the behavior, dispersion, and dissipation of the symmetric (quasisymmetric) and antisymmetric (quasiantisymmetric) filmplasmons in the nanofocusing <b>metal</b> <b>wedge.</b> The obtained results will be important for optimizing metallic nanofocusing structures and minimizing coupling and dissipative losses...|$|R
50|$|Each set {{consists}} of a <b>metal</b> <b>wedge</b> (the plug), and two shims (the feathers). The feathers are wide at the bottom, and tapered and curved at the top. When the two feathers are placed {{on either side of}} the plug, the combined width of the set is the same at both ends.|$|R

The wheels and gears are mounted in a four-post wrought iron frame.

50|$|Slips is {{a device}} used to grip {{and hold the}} upper part of a drill string to the drill floor on an oil rig. The slips are {{constructed}} as a collection of <b>metal</b> <b>wedges,</b> hinged together to form a circular shape around the drill pipe. On the inside surface, the slips normally has replaceable steel teeth that grips the pipe. The outsides of the slips are tapered and meets a similar taper on the drill floor. Usually the pipe goes through a Rotary table - machinery that makes the pipe rotate.|$|E
50|$|In December 1914, French aviator Roland Garros asked Saulnier {{to install}} his {{synchronization}} gear on Garros' Morane-Saulnier Type L. Unfortunately the gas-operated Hotchkiss machine gun he was provided had an erratic {{rate of fire}} and {{it was impossible to}} synchronize it with a spinning propeller. As an interim measure, the propeller blades were armored and fitted with <b>metal</b> <b>wedges</b> to protect the pilot from ricochets. Garros' modified monoplane was first flown in March 1915 and he began combat operations soon thereafter. Garros scored three victories in three weeks before he himself was downed on 18 April and his airplane, along with its synchronization gear and propeller was captured by the Germans.|$|E
40|$|Objective:this study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the fixation of the trabecular <b>metal</b> <b>wedge</b> in patients undergoing revision of total hip arthroplasty. Methods:twenty-three cases with minimum grading of Paprosky II-B that were operated between July 2008 and February 2013 were evaluated. These cases were evaluated based on radiographs before the operation, immediately after the operation and later on after the operation. Loss of fixation {{was defined as a}} change in the abduction angle of the component greater than 10 ° or any mobilization greater than 6 mm. Results:it was found that there was 100 % fixation of the acetabula after a mean of 29. 5 months. One case underwent removal of the implanted components due to infection. Conclusions:there is still no consensus regarding the best option for reconstructing hips with bone loss. However, revision using a trabecular <b>metal</b> <b>wedge</b> has presented excellent short-and medium-term results. This qualifies it as an important tool for achieving a fixed and stable acetabular component...|$|R
25|$|In its {{earliest}} days the intelligent design movement {{was called the}} 'wedge movement'. The wedge metaphor, attributed to Johnson, {{is that of a}} <b>metal</b> <b>wedge</b> splitting a log and represents using an aggressive public relations programme to create an opening for the supernatural in the public's understanding of science.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the possibility of}} efficient adiabatic nano-focusing of plasmons by a sharp triangular <b>metal</b> <b>wedge.</b> Geometrical optics approach and the approximation of continuous electrodynamics are used for the analysis. In particular, it is demonstrated that both the phase and group velocities of an incident anti-symmetric (with respect to the magnetic field) plasmon tend to zero {{at the tip of}} the wedge, and the plasmon adiabatically slows down, eventually dissipating in the metal. Typically, the amplitude of the plasmon significantly increases near the wedge tip, but this increase is finite even in the absence of dissipation in the metal. The dependence of the local field enhancement near the tip on structural parameters, dissipation in the metal, angle of incidence, etc. is analyzed in this paper. It is also shown that an anti-symmetric film plasmon can effectively be guided by a triangular <b>metal</b> <b>wedge,</b> forming a wedge plasmon mode that is localized near the tip of the wedge and propagates along this tip. A new existence condition for these localized wedge plasmons is derived and discussed...|$|R
50|$|The {{normal speed}} of a turbo {{generator}} is 1500 or 3000 rpm with four or two poles and at 50 Hz. Salient rotors will be very noisy and {{with a lot of}} windage loss. The rotating parts of a turbo generator are subjected to high mechanical stresses because of the high operation speed. To make the rotor mechanically resistant in large turbo-alternators, the rotor is normally forged from solid steel and alloys like chromium-nickel-steel or chromium-nickel-molybdenum are used. The overhang of windings at the periphery will be secured by steel retaining rings. Heavy non-magnetic <b>metal</b> <b>wedges</b> on top of the slots hold the field windings against centrifugal forces. Hard composition insulating materials, like mica and asbestos, are normally used in the slots of rotor. These material can withstand high temperatures and high crushing forces.|$|E
5000|$|Circa 1803, {{according}} to William Pattee's History of Old Braintree and Quincy (1878) Josiah Bemis, George Stearns, and Michael Wild developed a splitting method similar in concept to the plug and feather method. This technique for splitting stone (referred to by modern researchers as the [...] "Flat Wedge Method") entailed cutting slots {{in a shallow}} line into the stone using a cape chisel struck with a large hammer. Small, flat <b>metal</b> <b>wedges</b> were then driven between shims made of sheet iron. The method of feathers and plugs began to be employed around this time, and spread rapidly throughout the region. Evidence of stone split with both methods indicate the evolution of this technique. The method using the cape chisel created long rectangular slots, whereas the newer method, using a plug drill, left round holes.|$|E

40|$|We report {{numerical}} analysis and experimental observation of strongly localized plasmons {{guided by a}} triangular <b>metal</b> <b>wedge.</b> Dispersion and dissipation of such wedge plasmons are analyzed using the finite-difference time-domain algorithm. Experimental observation is conducted by the end-fire excitation and near-field detection of the predicted plasmons on a 40 degree silver nano-wedge. Good agreement with the theoretically predicted propagation distances is demonstrated. Differences between the theoretical and experimental field distribution are explained by insufficient resolution of the near-field optical probe...|$|R
5000|$|In rock climbing, a nut (or chock or chockstone) is a <b>metal</b> <b>wedge</b> {{threaded}} on a {{wire and}} is used for protection by wedging it into {{a crack in the}} rock. Quickdraws are clipped to the nut wire by the ascending climber and the rope threads through the quickdraw. Nuts {{come in a variety of}} sizes and styles, and several different brands are made by competing manufacturers. Most nuts are made of aluminum. Larger nuts may be threaded on Dyneema cord instead of wire, but this has become unusual.|$|R
5000|$|A {{staple remover}} is {{a device that}} allows for the quick removal of a staple from a {{material}} without causing damage. The best-known form of staple remover, designed for light-gauge staples, consists essentially of a) two opposing, pivot-mounted pairs of thin, steep wedges and b) a spring that returns the device to the open position after use. Although a simple <b>metal</b> <b>wedge</b> {{can be used for}} the same purpose, and although some staplers (especially small ones about 1.5 in long) feature such a wedge at their hinge end, use of the wedge tends to tear fragile papers.|$|R
5000|$|Whilst {{checking}} the pier foundations {{to see if}} the river bed was being scoured from around them, Noble had become aware that some diagonal tie bars were 'chattering', and in October 1878 had begun remedying this. Diagonal bracing was by flat bars running from one lug at a column section top to two sling plates bolted to a lug {{at the base of the}} equivalent section on an adjacent column. The bar and sling plates all had a matching longitudinal slot in them. The tie bar was placed between the sling plates with all three slots aligned and overlapping, and then a gib was driven through all three slots and secured. Two [...] "cotters" [...] (<b>metal</b> <b>wedges)</b> were then positioned to fill the rest of the slot overlap, and driven in hard to put the tie under tension.|$|E
5000|$|In December 1914 {{the famous}} French aviator Roland Garros, then serving with Escadrille 23, worked with Raymond Saulnier {{to create a}} gun synchronizer, using the gas {{operated}} Hotchkiss light machine gun. However the firing rate fluctuated {{too much for the}} synchronizer to function properly. As an interim measure, they then designed a [...] "safety backup" [...] in the form of braced [...] "deflectors" [...] (<b>metal</b> <b>wedges)</b> fitted to the rear surfaces of the propeller blades at the points where they could be struck by a bullet. Garros took his Type L fighter into combat with the deflectors in March 1915 and achieved immediate success, shooting down three German aircraft in April, a noteworthy feat at the time. The copper and brass-jacketed bullets that the French used were not likely to damage the harder steel of the wedges themselves. On 18 April 1915, Garros' deflector-equipped Type L force-landed behind German lines and was captured before he could burn it.|$|E
5000|$|On the Tay Bridge the {{diagonal}} bracing was {{by means of}} flat bars running from one lug at the column section top (an {{integral part of the}} column casting) to two sling plates bolted to {{the diagonal}}ly opposite lug. Bar and sling plates all had a matching longitudinal slot in them; the tie bar was placed between the sling plates with all three slots aligned and overlapping and a gib driven through all three slots and secured. Two cotters (<b>metal</b> <b>wedges)</b> were then positioned to fill the rest of the slot overlap, and driven in hard to put the tie under tension. Horizontal bracing was provided by (wrought iron) channel iron. The various bolt heads were too close to each other, and to the column for easy tightening up with spanners; this coupled with lack of precision in the preparation of the channel iron braces led to various on site fitting expedients (one of them described by a witness to the enquiry as [...] "about as slovenly a piece of work as ever I saw in my life").) ...|$|E
60|$|As for {{the fairy}} arrows, {{we know that}} even in ancient Etruria they were looked on as magical, for we {{sometimes}} see their points set, as amulets, in the gold of Etruscan necklaces. In Perugia the arrowheads are still sold as charms. All educated people, of course, have long been aware that the <b>metal</b> <b>wedge</b> is a celt, or ancient bronze axe-head, {{and that it was}} not fairies, but the forgotten peoples of this island who used the arrows with the tips of flint.

40|$|The Author(s) 2014. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract This paper describes the plasmonic modes in the parabolic cylinder geometry as a theoretical complement {{to the previous}} paper (J Phys A 42 : 185401) that considered the modes in the circular paraboloidal geometry. In order to identify the plasmonic modes in the parabolic cylinder geom-etry, analytic solutions for surface plasmon polaritons are examined by solving the wave equation for the magnetic field in parabolic cylindrical coordinates using quasi-separation of variables in combination with perturbation methods. The ex-amination of the zeroth-order perturbation equations showed that solutions cannot exist for the parabolic <b>metal</b> <b>wedge</b> but can be obtained for the parabolic metal groove as standing wave solutions indicated by the even and odd symmetries...|$|R
30|$|Other {{methods of}} {{fixation}} {{have also been}} described. In order to fix the medial opening wedge osteotomy, Puddu developed a plate with a <b>metal</b> <b>wedge</b> that inserts into the osteotomy space. The plates have 2 and 4 holes with wedge heights ranging from 5 to 17.5  mm. A bony cut is made under the guide wires to within 1  cm medial of the lateral cortex. Wedges of different heights are driven into place in the osteotomy line. The plate with the appropriate wedge height is inserted anterior to the medial collateral ligament. Cancellous screws {{are used in the}} proximal holes whereas cortical screws for distal holes [36, 37]. In a recent revision, Puddu has produced a different plate where the posterior slope can be altered with an AP height-adjustable wedge block and incorporates a locking system of screws.|$|R
50|$|Enormous {{quantities}} of stone were needed for these structures and {{the remains of}} the numerous quarries used can still be found, especially in the vicinity of Jerusalem’s Old City, notably those to the north known as Solomon's Quarries. Freeing the stones from the bedrock was an elaborate process: Wide grooves were chiseled with metal tools around the intended stone block. The block was then freed up by driving <b>metal</b> <b>wedges</b> into the grooves. The initial dressing of the stone was probably accomplished on site before transport. Many of these stones were very large, weighing between two and five tons. (The largest found, in the Western Wall Tunnel, measures some 12.8 meters in length, 3.4 meters high and 4.3 meters deep; it weighs about 660 tons.) Once moved to the building site, further fine chiseling was done and the blocks were hauled into place using ramps, cranes and crow bars. The stones were laid in dry courses, typically about 1 meter high without the use of any mortar. Each course was set 3 to 5 cm back from the course underneath it. Final dressing and refinements were carried out once the stones had been set in place.|$|E
40|$|Optical plasmon-polariton modes {{confined}} in both transverse dimensions to {{significantly less than}} a wavelength are exhibited in open waveguides structured as sharp <b>metal</b> <b>wedges.</b> The analysis reveals two distinctive modes corresponding to a localized mode on the wedge point and surface mode propagation on the abruptly bent interface.

40|$|Propagating {{two-dimensional}} plasmon modes guided along silver nanoridge waveguides with triangular and inverted triangular {{cross sections}} are investigated in this paper. Mode field profiles, dispersion curves, propagation distances, and figure-of-merits of the plasmon ridge modes are calculated for silver nanoridge waveguides with various triangular and inverted triangular waveguide cross sections. It is {{found that the}} triangular cross section nanoridge waveguide, if designed properly, can have longer propagation distance and higher figure-of-merit than the flat-top nanoridge waveguide of the same width. When the triangle height of the nanoridge is high, the mode approaches to the small angle wedge mode. An inverted triangular cross section nanoridge mode {{can be considered as}} a hybrid mode of two <b>metal</b> <b>wedge</b> plasmon modes. When inverted triangle depth increases, the propagation distance and the figure-of-merit decrease dramatically, suggesting the poorer performance when compared to the flat-top nanoridge plasmon waveguide...|$|R

30|$|Revision {{arthroplasty}} of {{the knee}} {{is one of the}} great challenges in orthopaedic surgery. The number of prosthesis replacements performed is rising, but the surgical procedure is very demanding: there is very little bone substrate and its architectural quality is poor [1]. In response, modular revision prostheses are viewed as an excellent treatment option [2]. The surgical material used in this type of surgery must be very versatile, as total knee revision arthroplasty poses several very complex problems, especially bone loss and insufficient soft tissue. The use of <b>metal</b> <b>wedges</b> and augmentations to compensate for bone loss has become generally accepted, and morselised or structural bone grafts are also commonly employed to treat bone defects [3].|$|E
