5|$|Each {{aircraft}} {{requires a}} month-long packaged <b>maintenance</b> plan (PMP) every 300 flight hours. The stealth system, including its radar absorbing metallic skin, account for almost {{one third of}} <b>maintenance.</b> The canopy was redesigned after the original design lasted an average of 331 hours instead of the required 800 hours.

5|$|Aircraft could undergo <b>maintenance,</b> {{and most}} {{functional}} and equipment tests carried out aboard - {{either in the}} hangar or on the deck. Some components and could be repaired on board, but other work was {{to be carried out}} by the workshops on the engine repair and component repair ships that would accompany the <b>maintenance</b> carrier.|$|E
5|$|All-electric and plug-in hybrid {{vehicles}} {{also have}} lower <b>maintenance</b> costs {{as compared to}} internal combustion vehicles, since electronic systems break down much less often than the mechanical systems in conventional vehicles, and the fewer mechanical systems on board last longer due to the better use of the electric engine. PEVs do not require oil changes and other routine <b>maintenance</b> checks.|$|E

5|$|As a {{long term}} company policy, in {{addition}} to the carrier's main activities, revenues are also generated by providing aircraft <b>maintenance</b> to foreign airlines, and specialist training for both Ethiopian and foreign trainees. Every year, pilots and technicians graduate from both the Pilot School, inaugurated in 1964, and the Aviation <b>Maintenance</b> Technician School, established in 1967. The American Federal Aviation Administration accredited the airline's <b>maintenance</b> division with license No. ETIY 102F.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} RAAF's {{reorganisation}} from a geographically based command-and-control {{system to}} one based on function, No.4 <b>Maintenance</b> Group was superseded by <b>Maintenance</b> Command on 1October 1953. In September 1959, No.1 AD came {{under the control of}} Support Command, formed when <b>Maintenance</b> Command was amalgamated with Training Command. Between June 1950 and October 1960, No.1 AD maintained a detachment at RAAF Station Tocumwal, New South Wales, to store obsolete aircraft awaiting disposal.|$|E
5|$|By 1961, {{when all}} {{airframe}} <b>maintenance</b> at Laverton {{was transferred to}} Nos.2 and 3 Aircraft Depots, No.1 AD had serviced forty-two aircraft types throughout its existence. It continued to maintain aero engines, and began supporting telecommunications equipment as well. The aircraft engine repair facilities at No.1 AD were closed down in 1968. Staff were transferred to No.3 Aircraft Depot at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, {{to prepare for the}} introduction of the General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing bomber to Australian service and concentrate on maintaining the new aircraft's engines. No.1 AD's focus thereafter shifted to ground support, manufacturing, installing, servicing and providing training for navigational, air traffic control, telecommunications and motor transport equipment used by the Air Force and other sections of Defence and government. From 1968 to 1977, the depot was organised into two components, Telecommunications Installation and <b>Maintenance</b> Squadron and Ground Equipment <b>Maintenance</b> Squadron. These were subdivided in February 1977 into Telecommunications Squadron (maintaining ground communications equipment for control towers, transmitters and receiving stations in Australia and the region), Radar Squadron (supporting surveillance systems at RAAF Bases Williamtown, Amberley, Townsville, Darwin and Pearce), Ground Equipment <b>Maintenance</b> Squadron (maintaining motor transport, and other ground-based mechanical and electro-mechanical systems), and Intermediate Level <b>Maintenance</b> Squadron (communications, navigation and other ground-based <b>maintenance</b> at Laverton, as well as spectrometric analysis of oil used by the RAAF in aircraft and other equipment).|$|E

5|$|CAM sailings were {{initially}} limited to North American convoys with aircraft <b>maintenance</b> {{performed by the}} Royal Canadian Air Force at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. CAM ships sailed on Gibraltar and Freetown convoys beginning in September, 1941, after an aircraft <b>maintenance</b> unit was established at the RAF base at North Front, Gibraltar. No CAM aircraft were provided during January and February 1942 after it proved impossible to maintain the catapult-mounted aircraft in flying order during the North Atlantic winter. CAM sailings resumed on 6 March 1942 on North Atlantic convoys and in April on the Arctic Russian convoys with an RAF aircraft <b>maintenance</b> unit in Archangelsk.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, the DISCOM {{consisted}} of a Headquarters Company, a Division Materiel Management Center, a Division Data Center, the 15th Medical Battalion, 15th Adjutant General Battalion, 15th Finance Company, 15th Supply and Transport Battalion, 27th <b>Maintenance</b> Battalion and the 68th Chemical Company. In October 1984, the 1st and 2nd Forward Support Battalions were activated from elements of the three functional battalions attached to the unit. The following year saw the Army of Excellence Reorganization (AOE) transform the remaining elements of the three functional battalions (<b>maintenance,</b> medical, and supply and transport) into the 4th Main Support Battalion. The AOE reorganization also added the 493rd Transportation Company (Aircraft <b>Maintenance)</b> to the Division Support Command. The forward and main support battalions, along with the Aviation <b>Maintenance</b> Company, were redesignated in 1987, becoming the 15th and 115th Forward Support Battalions, 27th Main Support Battalion, and 227th Transportation Company (Aviation <b>Maintenance).</b>|$|E
5|$|Every {{road that}} is {{maintained}} by DelDOT, including Interstate, U.S., and state routes, is assigned a <b>maintenance</b> road number (also {{known as a}} reference number). The <b>maintenance</b> road numbers are only unique in a specific county and some roads can be designated with multiple road numbers. For example, Bryants Corner Road in Kent County is designated as Road 205, Road 103, and Road 219. Suffixed <b>maintenance</b> road numbers exist near their parent roads, often for a short alignment. For example, Woodland Ferry Road in Sussex County is designated Road 78, while Old Sailor Road, a short road branching off from it near Laurel, is designated as Road 78A. The <b>maintenance</b> road numbers are signed with little white markers at intersections showing the two roads that intersect each other and on auxiliary plates below warning signs approaching intersections.|$|E

5|$|Interstate, U.S., {{and state}} routes have <b>maintenance</b> road numbers that {{often do not}} match their signed route numbers.

5|$|<b>Maintenance</b> of the Australian Globemasters is {{undertaken}} {{by both the}} RAAF and Boeing.

It remained unchanged until April1, 1997, when ownership and <b>maintenance</b> of the route was transferred from the state of New York to Steuben County as part of a highway <b>maintenance</b> swap between the two levels of government. In the switch, NY333 and nearby NY432, both maintained by the state, were given to Steuben County in exchange for <b>maintenance</b> of NY415 from Meads Creek Road in Coopers Plains (northwest of Painted Post) to Babcock Hollow Road in Bath as well as for <b>maintenance</b> of Hamilton Street (the original routing of NY17) between US15 and Gang Mills.
