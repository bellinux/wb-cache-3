5|$|The <b>movable</b> type {{invented by}} Bi Sheng was {{ultimately}} trumped {{by the use}} of woodblock printing due to the limitations of the enormous Chinese character writing system, yet <b>movable</b> type printing continued to be used and was improved in later periods. The Yuan dynasty scholar-official Wang Zhen (fl. 1290–1333) implemented a faster typesetting process, improved Bi's baked-clay <b>movable</b> type character set with a wooden one, and experimented with tin-metal <b>movable</b> type. The wealthy printing patron Hua Sui (1439–1513) of the Ming dynasty established China's first metal <b>movable</b> type (using bronze) in 1490. In 1638 the Beijing Gazette switched their printing process from woodblock to <b>movable</b> type printing. Yet it was during the Qing dynasty that massive printing projects began to employ <b>movable</b> type printing. This includes the printing of sixty-six copies of a 5,020 volume long encyclopedia in 1725, the Gujin Tushu Jicheng (Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times), which necessitated the crafting of 250,000 <b>movable</b> type characters cast in bronze. By the 19th century the European style printing press replaced the old Chinese methods of <b>movable</b> type, while traditional woodblock printing in modern East Asia is used sparsely and for aesthetic reasons.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century, metal <b>movable</b> type {{printing}} {{was developed in}} Ming Dynasty China (and earlier in Joseon Korea, by the mid 13th century), and was widely applied in China by at least the 16th century. In Jiangsu and Fujian, wealthy Ming era families sponsored the use of metal {{type printing}} (mostly using bronze). This included the printing works of Hua Sui (1439–1513), who pioneered the first Chinese bronze-type <b>movable</b> printing in the year 1490. In 1718, during the mid Qing Dynasty (1644–1912), the scholar of Tai'an known as Xu Zhiding developed <b>movable</b> type with enamelware instead of earthenware. There was also Zhai Jinsheng (b. 1784), a teacher of Jingxian, Anhui, who spent thirty years making a font of earthenware <b>movable</b> type, and by 1844 he had over 100,000 Chinese writing characters in five sizes.|$|E

5|$|<b>Movable</b> type: The polymath {{scientist}} and official Shen Kuo (1031–1095) of the Song Dynasty (960–1279) {{was the first}} to describe the process of <b>movable</b> type printing in his Dream Pool Essays of 1088. He attributed the innovation of reusable fired clay characters to a little-known artisan named Bi Sheng (990–1051). Bi had experimented with wooden type characters, but their use was not perfected until 1297 to 1298 with the model of the official Wang Zhen (fl. 1290–1333) of the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368), who also arranged written characters by rhyme scheme on the surface of round table compartments. It was not until 1490 with the printed works of Hua Sui (1439–1513) of the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) that the Chinese perfected metal <b>movable</b> type characters, namely bronze. The Qing Dynasty (1644–1912) scholar Xu Zhiding of Tai'an, Shandong developed vitreous enamel <b>movable</b> type printing in 1718.|$|E
5|$|Despite these advances, <b>movable</b> type {{printing}} never gained {{the amount of}} widespread use in East Asia that woodblock printing had achieved since the Chinese Tang Dynasty in the 9th century. With written Chinese, the vast amount of written morpheme characters impeded <b>movable</b> type's acceptance and practical use, and was therefore seen as largely unsatisfactory. Furthermore, the European printing press, first invented by Johannes Gutenberg (1398–1468), was eventually wholly adopted as the standard in China, yet the tradition of woodblock printing remains popular in East Asian countries still.|$|E

40|$|Securities on <b>movables</b> {{are one of}} {{the major}} feature of credit mechanisms. Under {{domestic}} law, this type of guarantee is widely used, specifically in France, Great-Britain and Canada, under different forms. On the other hand, due to legal uncertainties surrounding operations bearing an international character, securities on <b>movables</b> are rarely used in international transactions. Regrettably, this established fact, particularly illustrated by French law, appears to go against modern tendencies to favour the internationalisation of commercial activities. The analysis of the rules of French private international law {{in the light of the}} corresponding rules of English and Canadian law allows us to identify the main obstacles in the international traffic of securities on <b>movables</b> and to propose reforms initiatives. Consequently, the analysis of several ratified or drafted international conventions which are related to some aspects of securities on <b>movables</b> in an international context can bring suitable solutions to problems raised by the internationalisation of securities. This thesis proposes that these international agreements carrying conflict of law rules or uniform substantive law constitute the most promising means of regulating these mechanisms which are directly connected to modern international financing...|$|R
