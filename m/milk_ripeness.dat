40|$|During 48 h {{germination}} {{of wheat}} grains of different ripeness {{the amount of}} RNA in the germinating embryos doubles, while the rate of synthesis is {{to a large extent}} correlated with the level of ribonucleic acids accumulated during the development and ripening of the grain. The highest RNA content was noted in the germs developing from grain harvested at the stage of full ripeness, the lowest - in germs from grain at <b>milk</b> <b>ripeness.</b> Intensity of 3 H-uridine incorporation into the RNA fraction of the germs during 24 -h germination also depends on ripeness. Significantly lower RNA synthesis was noted in germinating embryos from wheat grain harvested during <b>milk</b> <b>ripeness</b> as compared to wax or full ripeness...|$|E
40|$|Triticale (MT- 3) caryopses were {{collected}} at three developmental stages (milk, milk-wax, and full ripeness i. e. 25, 39, 53 days after flowering) and germinated for 72 hours. The highest polyribosome {{contribution to the}} sum total of ribosomes, as well as, the highest 3 H-uridine incorporation into the total ribosomal fraction of embryos (seedlings) were found at full ripeness, lower - at <b>milk</b> <b>ripeness,</b> and the lowest at milk-wax ripeness. Treatment of caryopses with gibberellin-A 3 (GA 3) and benzyloadenine (BA) caused an increase in the percentage of embryonic polyribosomes in caryopses which {{were collected}} at milk and full ripeness. Whereas the significant increase in 3 H-uridine incorporation intothe total ribosomal fractions of embryos (seedlings) was observed only during the germination of the least ripe caryopses. This was characteristic of samples with caryopses at <b>milk</b> <b>ripeness</b> treated with BA, or BA and GA 3 together. The studies proved that the mechanism which prevents the germination of unripe Triticale cyryopses and the formation of polyribosomes which were germination-induced, originated at the final stage of grain development, before its full ripeness...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} our vigour tests was to reveal the {{relationships}} betwen the viability of wheat grains, their germination rate and capacity and respiration intensity. The wheat grain was collected in two ways. The first grain {{was removed from the}} ears immediately after harvest (denoted as series A) and the second grain was left in the ears at room temperature for two weeks after harvest (denoted as series B). This grain was harvested at three stages of <b>ripeness</b> (<b>milk,</b> wax and full ripeness). Our results demonstrated that wheat grain at the full ripeness stage was of better biological quality than that at <b>milk</b> and wax <b>ripeness</b> stages. The grain of series B from all ripeness stages showed a higher viability than the grain of series A. On the other hand, grains at milk, wax and full repeness in series B were more mature than those at milk, wax and full ripeness in series A. Therefore it can be concluded probably that the embryo and endosperm in the latter grains were much more developed and much organic matter was passing from the stalk to the seeds when they were kept in the ear for two weeks after harvest...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a weather-yield model {{developed for the}} purpose of estimating spring barley yield on the basis of dry spells occurring in individual periods between the phenological phases of that plant. For that purpose research material on spring barley, originating from the years 1976 - 1997, was used as well as diurnal sums of precipitation. Five periods were considered in the analysis: sowing-emergence, emergence-tillering, tillering-heading, heading-milk <b>ripeness</b> and <b>milk</b> ripeness-full <b>ripeness.</b> In the study a model of changes in the amount of water available for plant during rainless periods was used. Five measures were adopted for characterisation of the approximation error: correlation coefficient, mean relative error, relative root mean square error, model efficiency and coefficient of residual mass. The analyses performed demonstrated that yield reduction is significantly influenced by rainless periods that occur in the sowing-emergence and tillering-heading inter-phase periods. The adopted criteria for yield reduction estimation show considerable similarity for the emergence-tillering and heading-milk ripeness inter-phase periods. At the same time, their influence on yield reduction is three-fold lower than during the sowing-emergence and tillering-heading inter-phase periods. Analyses performed {{with the use of the}} developed model indicate that yield size is affected by rainless periods of duration longer than 30 % of the inter-phase period.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the yield response factor (Ky) of wheat with respect to deficit irrigation at different growth stages. The experiment was conducted in Shahrekord in three crop growing seasons using randomized complete blocks design with 3 replications. Treatments consisted of five levels of deficit irrigation: E 0 (full irrigation), E 1 (85 %), E 2 (70 %) and E 3 (55 %) of potential evapotranspiration of wheat and E 4 (no irrigation), and were assigned to six growth stages: T 1 (establishment), T 2 (tillering), T 3 (head development), T 4 (flowering), T 5 (<b>milk</b> <b>ripeness)</b> and T 6 (maturity harvest). Potential evapotranspiration was measured using a lysimeter, which was in conditions (soil texture and structure and plant growth) similar to the field. After harvesting the plants, grain yield was measured and wheat yield response factor was calculated. Results of combined analysis of variance showed that grain yield was significantly affected by deficit irrigation at establishment, tillering, head development, flowering and <b>milk</b> <b>ripeness</b> stages. The highest and the lowest grain yields (6354 and 2203 kg/ha, respectively) were obtained in E 0 and E 4 treatments, respectively. Potential evapotranspiration of wheat was 641 mm in this area. Yield response factors (ky) were 0. 55 - 0. 76 in T 1 growth stage, 0. 58 - 0. 97 in T 2, 0. 70 - 1. 43 in T 3, 0. 75 - 1. 45 in T 4, 0. 68 - 0. 95 in T 5 and 0. 52 - 0. 58 in T 6. In general, in all plant growth stages, actual and relative yields decrease as relative evapotranspiration decreases...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Two barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) forage {{varieties}} – Hemus and Karnobat, {{with high}} and low Rubisco content in the fully expanded first leaves (Metodiev and Demirevska-Kepova, 1992), were compared in pot vegetation experiments in respect of yield. Changes {{in the content of}} leaf pigments, the levels of total soluble and Rubisco immunoreactive protein were followed during six phenophases: 3 rd leaf, tillering, stem extension, heading, anthesis and <b>milk</b> <b>ripeness.</b> The results show maintenance of high level of photosynthetic components in the phases critical for grain filling regardless of the differences observed in the primary leaves. Thus, the use of Rubisco as an early selection criterion for improved yield is dubious. The question, whether Rubisco content in leaves during the grain-filling period might be a useful marker for productivity, remains open and needs further investigations...|$|E
40|$|It was found, by {{comparing}} the densitometric profiles of ribosomal proteins of wheat embryos in milk and full grain ripeness, that {{in the process of}} development and ripening of caryopses the percentual proportion of low molecular weight proteins increases at the cost of those of high molecular weight. This concerns both acidic and basic proteins. In electrophoretic separation of ribosomal proteins from embryos of fully ripe seeds by the method of two-dimensional electrophoresis the appearance of three new low molecular weight proteins - an acidic one and two basic ones - was observed. These proteins were not found in the embryos of caryopses of <b>milk</b> <b>ripeness.</b> These results indicate that with development and ripening of wheat caryopses new low molecular weight ribosomal proteins are built into the ribosomes in the embryo. These changes are both quantitative and qualitative...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Drought {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} factors that limit plant productivity. Oxidative stress is a secondary event in many unfavorable environmental conditions. Intracellular proteases have a role in the metabolism reorganisation and nutrient remobilization under stress. In order to under stand the relative significance of oxidative stress and proteolysis in the yield reduction under drought, four varieties of Triticum aestivum L. with different field drought resistance were examined. Methods: A two-year field experiment was conducted. Analyses were performed on the upper most leaf of control plants and plants under water deficitat the stages most critical for yield reduction under drought (from jointing till <b>milk</b> <b>ripeness).</b> Leaf water deficit and electrolyte leakage, malondyaldehyde level, activities and isoenzymes of superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase, leaf protein content and proteolytic activity were studied. Yield components were analyzed. Results: A general trend of increasing the membrane in stability and accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides was observed with some differences among varieties, especially under drought. The anti-oxidative enzyme activities were progressively enhanced, as well as the azocaseinolytic activities. The leaf protein content decreased under drought at the last phase. Differences among varieties were observed in the parameters under study. They were compared to yield components` reduction under water deprivation...|$|E
40|$|Tan spot (Pyrenophora tritici - repentis) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} wheat diseases in Latvia. Significant spreading of this disease was observed from 1998. Field experiments were carried out at the Research and Training Farm "Peterlauki" of the Latvia University of Agriculture, during 1998 - 2003. Development of diseases was observed on 14 winter wheat varieties, dynamics of development was investigated on 'Donskaja polukarlikovaja' and 'Stava'. Assessments of the disease severity were carried out on the upper three leaves each week from the start of stem elongation to full ripening. Tan spot was observed at the stage of stem elongation in 2003, and only after flowering in 1999. Increase of the disease severity was slow until stage of <b>milk</b> <b>ripeness,</b> and only in late stages of wheat development sharp increase of the disease was observed. Total rate of infection (through the session of vegetation) was very slow (0, 01 - 0, 19), but during ripening rate achieved 0, 5 - 0, 6. The main reason of so unequal development of the disease seems changes in amount of infection sources. Other possible reason of rapid increase of the disease development is the relationship between leaf age and susceptibility to the disease. Further research is necessary for better understanding of tan spot life cycle...|$|E
40|$|Caryopses {{collected}} at milk, wax and full ripeness {{as well as}} aged ones stored at air humidity of 30, 60 and 80 per cent were subjected to germination. The more unripe were the caryopses the lower was their germination capacity and dry mass increment of the sprouts, {{the same was true}} for fully ripe but aged caryopses. After 48 h of germination in the presence of radioactive precursors the embryos were removed from the caryopses and used for isolation of the total ribosomal fraction and RNA. Distinct synthesis of three basic total RNA fractions and of the polyribosomal fraction was observed in all samples and in embryos from grain which had completely lost its germination capacity. High radioactivity was recorded in preparations of total RNA and polyribosomal ones from 48 -h sprouts growing from caryopses {{collected at}} <b>milk</b> <b>ripeness</b> and in those of aged caryopses stored under air humidity of 30 and 60 per cent. According to the authors, the depressed amount of latent forms of RNA (preformed mRNA, tRNA and ribosomes) is the cause of intensive 3 H-uridine incorporation into RNA in embryos from unripe and aged caryopses. For germination of grains with a reduced amount of latent forms the biosynthesis mechanisms must be based to a much higher extent on newly synthesised molecules of ribonucleic acids...|$|E
40|$|Triticale var. Lasko embryos, {{isolated}} from grain gathered at <b>milk</b> <b>ripeness,</b> {{the beginning of}} wax ripeness and at full ripeness, were allowed to germinate for 48 h on agar with glucose. The highest incorporation of tritiated adenosine into polyribosomal RNA during germination {{was found in the}} ribosome fractions from embryos of grain gathered at full ripeness, lower incorporation was in preparations from embryos of milk ripe grain and the lowest in preparations from embryos of wax ripe grain. Different tendencies were observed in respect to the synthesis of ribosomal proteins. The highest incorporation of 14 C-amino acids into ribosomal proteins was found in preparations of ribosome fractions from embryos of milk ripe grain, lower in preparations of embryos from fully ripe grain, the lowest in preparations of embryos from wax ripe grain. ABA (10 - 4 M) completely inhibited the external symptoms of germination of immature embryos, while its inhibition of the synthesis of polyribosomal RNA and ribosomal proteins was greater the more mature the embryos that were germinated. The greatest stimulation of precocious germination by exogenous BA and GA 3 was demonstrated in the least mature embryos {{isolated from}} milk ripe grain. Under the influence of both stimulators, an increase of the proportion of polyribosomes in the total ribosome fraction occurred in this sample, as did a rise in the intensity of ribosomal protein synthesis. The incorporation of 3 H-adenosine into polyribosomal RNA, however, was lower than in the control sample. The results obtained suggest that the regulation of precocious germination of triticale embryos by phyto-hormones is not directly related to transcription...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTwo durum (Triticum durum L.), Barakatli- 95 and Garagylchyg- 2; and two bread (Triticum aestivum L.) wheat cultivars, Azamatli- 95 and Giymatli- 2 / 17 with {{different}} sensitivities to drought were {{grown in the}} field on a wide area under normal irrigation and severe water deficit. Drought caused a more pronounced inhibition in photosynthetic parameters in the more sensitive cvs Garagylchyg- 2 and Giymatli- 2 / 17 compared with the tolerant cvs Barakatli- 95 and Azamatli- 95. Upon dehydration, a decline in total chlorophyll and relative water content was evident in all cultivars, especially in later periods of ontogenesis. Potential quantum yield of PS II (Fv/Fm ratio) in cv Azamatli- 95 was maximal during stalk emergency stage {{at the beginning of}} drought. This parameter increased in cv Garagylchyg- 2, while in tolerant cultivar Barakatli- 95 significant changes were not observed. Contrary to other wheat genotypes in Giymatli- 2 / 17 drought caused a decrease in PS II quantum yield. Drought-tolerant cultivars showed a significant increase in CAT activity as compared to control plants. In durum wheat cultivars maximal activity of CAT was observed at the <b>milk</b> <b>ripeness</b> and in bread wheat cultivars at the end of flowering. APX activity also increased in drought-treated leaves: in tolerant wheat genotypes maximal activity occurred at the end of flowering, in sensitive ones at the end of ear formation. GR activity increased in the tolerant cultivars under drought stress at all stages of ontogenesis. SOD activity significantly decreased in sensitive cultivars and remained at the control level or increased in resistant ones.
