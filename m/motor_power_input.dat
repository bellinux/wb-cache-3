40|$|A powered {{lower limb}} prosthesis, which {{consists}} of a four bar mechanism, a torsional spring and a brushed DC motor, was previously designed and fabricated. To regulate the <b>motor</b> <b>power</b> <b>input,</b> a two level controller was proposed and built. The control algorithm includes a higher level finite state controller and lower level PID controllers. To implement the control system, a digital signal processor (DSP) control board and MATLAB Simulink were used to realize the higher level control and a DC motor controller was used to realize the lower level PID control. Sensors were selected to provide the required feedback. The entire control system was implemented on a convenient to carry backpack. Amputee subject testing was performed to obtain some experimental verification of the design. The {{results showed that the}} control system performed consistently with the designed control algorithm and did assist in the amputee’s walking. Compared to a currently available powered prosthesis, this control is simple in structure and able to mimic the nonlinear behavior of the ankle closely...|$|E
40|$|In {{preliminary}} building energy assessments, it {{is often}} desired to estimate a <b>motor's</b> <b>input</b> <b>power.</b> <b>Motor</b> <b>power</b> estimates in this context should be rapid, safe, and noninvasive. Existing methods for <b>motor</b> <b>input</b> <b>power</b> estimation, such as direct measurement (wattmeter), Current Method, and Slip Method were evaluated. If installed equipment displays <b>input</b> <b>power</b> or average current, then using such readings are preferred. If installed equipment does not display <b>input</b> <b>power</b> or current, the application of wattmeters or current clamps is too time-consuming and invasive for the preliminary energy audit. In that case, if a shaft speed measurement is readily available, then the Slip Method is a satisfactory method for estimating <b>motor</b> <b>input</b> <b>power.</b> An analysis of performance data for 459 motors suggests comparable performance for predicting normalized (to the nominal <b>motor</b> <b>input</b> <b>power)</b> <b>motor</b> <b>input</b> <b>power</b> with the Current and Slip Methods: 10. 0 % and 9. 9 % RMSE, respectively. Both of these methods may be improved by applying regression on the predicted variable and/or nameplate parameters. For example, the Slip Method could be improved by applying a second-order regression, thereby reducing the predicted load factor residual RMSE of the data set from 9. 0 % to 8. 2 %. The Current and Slip Methods were also evaluated on two real motors. The normalized (to the nominal <b>motor</b> <b>input</b> <b>power)</b> predicted <b>input</b> <b>power</b> RMSE for the Current Method was on average 15 % for the two motors; for the Slip Method the corresponding average was 17. 5 %. In some cases, shaft speed measurements may not be available. A temperature-based approach for estimating <b>motor</b> <b>input</b> <b>power</b> was investigated. Other required parameters include ambient temperature, motor efficiency, and a motor thermal constant. The temperature approach offers quick, safe, and non-invasive <b>motor</b> <b>power</b> estimation. However, thermal coefficients may vary significantly across motors and a model to predict the thermal coefficients {{has yet to be}} developed. Furthermore, the temperature approach has a very strong dependence on motor efficiency uncertainty. Experiments were performed on two motors to determine their motor thermal constants. If a motor's thermal constants and running efficiency are known, then this method gave <b>motor</b> <b>input</b> <b>power</b> estimates with a RMSE (normalized to the nominal <b>input</b> <b>power)</b> on the order of 4 % for the studied motors...|$|R

40|$|Aiming at the {{drawbacks}} of the optimization and design methods and the practical production goal of least energy consumption, {{a new theory}} is raised that the gas of the layer released energy in the lifting process including two parts: dissolved-gas expansion energy and free-gas expansion energy.

40|$|A {{bacterial}} ftagellum {{is driven}} by a reversible rotary <b>motor.</b> The <b>power</b> <b>input</b> is determined by protonmotive force and proton flux, the power output by torque and speed: interrelationships between these parameters provide important clues to motor mechanisms. Here we describe the relationship between torque and speed at constant protonmotive force. The measurements are analogous to those {{that could be made}} by plugging an electric motor into a constant-voltage outlet, varying the external load, and determining the torque delivered at different speeds. We used suspensions of metabolizing cells of a motile Streptococcus, varied the extemal load by changing the viscosity of the medium, determined motor speed from the frequency of vibration of the cell body, and inferred motor torque from the rate of body rotation. The flagellar bundles rotate more rapidly than formerly supposed, at rates that increase linearly with temperature. The torque delivered by the flagellar motor drops linearly with speed. At high speed, the torque-generating cycle associated with the transfer of one proton appears to dissipate free energy in a series of small steps...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} monitor temperature in neurosurgical bone grinding procedure using the <b>motor</b> electrical <b>power</b> as <b>input.</b> Bone grinding is a critical procedure in the skull base neurosurgery to remove the cranial bone and approach the tumor through the sphenoid sinus. Heat generated during grinding could damage the optic nerve or coagulate the blood in the carotid artery, while direct temperature measurement is difficult. The temperature estimation is realized using a heat conversion model and the thermal model based on finite element analysis (FEA).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a fuzzy logic based slip controller for an induction motor, with efficiency optimization for steady state operation. The speed control is accomplished through a Mandani type fuzzy controller, with 11 rules, taking speed error (built with 5 Membership Functions - M. F.) and speed error variation (3 M.

40|$|A dc {{brushless}} motor driven mixer unit (a vaneaxial fan) {{was designed and}} evaluated for use in cryogenic fluids (liquids and gases). It was found to operate well in all fluids {{in which it was}} tested. The test fluids were liquid and gaseous helium, hydrogen in the liquid phase gas phase and mixtures of the two phases, and liquid nitrogen. It operated for over 100 hr at cryogenic temperatures without damage to the bearings and at the conclusion of testing the condition of the bearings was such that an operational life of 5000 hr appeared possible. The unit demonstrated that (with the brushless dc motor principle) useful pumping of cryogenic fluids could be accomplished with very small <b>power</b> <b>inputs</b> to the mixer motor. During test, the <b>motor</b> <b>input</b> <b>power</b> varied from approximately 0. 5 W to 2. 5 W, depending on fluid density. The high <b>power</b> <b>input</b> produced a mixer efficiency of over 49 percent. In an earlier program (see NASA Report CR- 72365), a mixer using an ac induction motor demonstrated an efficiency of 17. 7 percent under the same conditions, illustrating the advantage of the dc {{brushless motor}} driven unit. The mixer also demonstrated its ability to automatically vary speed {{as a function of the}} density of the fluid being pumped.

50|$|A {{mud motor}} (or {{drilling}} motor) is a progressive cavity {{positive displacement pump}} (PCPD) placed in the drill string to provide additional power to the bit while drilling. The PCPD pump uses drilling fluid (commonly referred to as drilling mud, or just mud) to create eccentric motion in the power section of the motor which is transferred as concentric power to the drill bit (well). The mud motor uses different rotor and stator configurations to provide optimum performance for the desired drilling operation, typically {{increasing the number of}} lobes and length of power assembly for greater horsepower.

50|$|At least 25% of the <b>input</b> <b>power</b> must be {{dissipated}} by {{the cooler}} when peak power is utilized for long periods. In normal case however, the peak power {{is used for}} only short periods, thus the actual cooler capacity required might be considerably less. The oil volume in the hydraulic tank is also acting as a heat accumulator when peak power is used. The system efficiency is very much dependent {{on the type of}} hydraulic work tool equipment, the hydraulic pumps and <b>motors</b> used and <b>power</b> <b>input</b> to the hydraulics may vary a lot. Each circuit must be evaluated and the load cycle estimated. New or modified systems must always be tested in practical work, covering all possible load cycles. An easy way of measuring the actual average power loss in the system is to equip the machine with a test cooler and measure the oil temperature at cooler inlet, oil temperature at cooler outlet and the oil flow through the cooler, when the machine is in normal operating mode. From these figures the test cooler power dissipation can be calculated and this is equal to the power loss when temperatures are stabilized. From this test the actual required cooler can be calculated to reach specified oil temperature in the oil tank. One problem can be to assemble the measuring equipment inline, especially the oil flow meter.|$|R
