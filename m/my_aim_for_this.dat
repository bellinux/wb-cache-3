My conclusion is that Mormon Church is a religious sect. Their organisation has several sect characteristics according to sect definitions; see for example Göran Gustafsson (2000), Mikael Rothstein (1997) and Bryan R. Wilson (1970). Other researchers in religious studies think that the Mormon Church is not a sect but a cult. To a lot of people, researchers in religious studies or not, religious sects are something bad. This is an unbalanced view, because in many cases people should have been alcoholics or a drug addicts if they were not members of a religious sect. There are in all societies religious groups that are dangerous for {{the people who want to}} be within this kind of groups. According to my analysis The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints can’t be seen as a dangerous sect even if the church fit the definition for manipulative sects...|$|E

Japanese university learners of English seem to have grown used to being silently spoonfed, memorizing what the teacher has said or written on the blackboard and having very little chance to use the target language themselves. <b>My</b> <b>aims</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> paper are to find how Japanese English teachers perceive their roles and duties or functions and to learn how much of the time they practise them, using the quantitative method of questionnaires. This study is based on responses from 78 Japanese English teachers at universities and high schools. The data were analysed by using the t-test (an independent sample) on responses to Questions 6 & 7 from these teachers.

I created my own compositions, emphasizing post-tonal music theory techniques as way of exploring how the contemporary sounds might add {{a new dimension to}} Shakespearean classics. I limited myself to one instrument, the cello, {{to make use of the}} instrumental range of what is often seen as the musical instrument that is closest to the human voice.

These explore the coordination and manipulation of pitch class, pitch intervals, and the mod- 12 complement system. 20 th century post-tonal musical influences include Milton Babbitt's "Philomel" (1964), Steve Reich's "Different Trains" (1988), and the fourth movement of Anton Webern's " 5 Sätze Für Streichquartett" (1909).

40|$|Abstract <b>My</b> <b>aim</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> {{paper is}} to analyse the {{character}} Jeeves' obsession with perfect clothing in     P. G. Wodehouse's The Inimitable Jeeves (1923). My method has been to study the historical context of the British aristocracy {{at the time of}} the first publication of the book in 1923, as well as the previous four decades during which the author grew up and decisive changes in the British class society took place. This paper studies sources on the significance of clothing in general, and examines its importance at the time in particular. For my analysis I have borrowed elements from new historicism. The norms, traditions and values of the aristocracy lost in importance during this time, and the aristocracy was divided into individuals who were willing to adopt to these changes and others who fought to defy them. My conclusion is that Jeeves considers the strict dress codes to be an important symbol of the old aristocratic values that he has to defend, in order to legitimize his own position, as he is profoundly devoted to his calling of being a first class valet faithful to the old traditions. Wooster, then, acts as Jeeves' opponent on the matter as he embodies the part of the aristocracy willing to embrace the changes instead...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} is a document influenced by a traditional educational process, which {{is in contrast to}} my educational philosophy, i. e., in regards to my thesis project and my personal beliefs. I attempted to develop a high school based on the individual as the learner, in which he may reinforce his weak areas and strengthen his career goals. This is what I feel education should be, but presently the system forces students to build up school images or stereotype their professors. I took it upon myself to select a project that would challenge my weak areas in order to assure a learning experience during thesis year.

40|$|The goal of Hope, Faith and Trust: Conversations with Tibetans in Exile was {{to create}} a {{documentary}} to serve as a platform for Tibetan refugees living in India to tell, in their own words, the story of the Tibetan peoples 2 ̆ 7 political struggles since the Chinese government occupied Tibet in the 1950 s. To achieve this goal, this project utilized oral-history interviews with Tibetan exiles, gathered as part of the University of Arkansas TEXT Program. The TEXT Program, short for Tibetans in Exile Today, is a study abroad oral-history project in which undergraduate students conduct interviews with Tibetans living in India. The film is comprised of footage shot by TEXT Program students, interviews I shot as part of the TEXT Program, and archival footage and photographs. This fifteen minute documentary is meant to represent the differing opinions of the Tibetan exiled community regarding the past, present, and future of their culture. The TEXT Program itself is the inspiration <b>for</b> <b>this</b> documentary. As the Graduate Assistant for the TEXT Program, I gained a thorough understanding of the plight facing the Tibetan people. I felt compelled to aid the Tibetan cause with this film by not only providing a platform for different Tibetans 2 ̆ 7 points of view to be heard, but also by presenting these opinions intertwined in a hard-hitting, no-nonsense way designed to help the viewer comprehend the severity of the Tibetan political situation, as well as the possible consequences of ignoring this issue. Following my trip to India with the TEXT Program in June 2013, I wanted to help the Tibetans make their story more broadly known to the Western world. The mainstream media offers little coverage of the political struggles of Tibetans and the human rights violations perpetrated by the Chinese government in Tibet. <b>My</b> <b>aim</b> is <b>for</b> <b>this</b> film to help foster support for Tibet 2 ̆ 7 s cause, as well as compassion for beings everywhere who are suffering...|$|R
40|$|SAMMENDRAG This thesis {{examines}} {{a possible}} ‘spiritual vacuum’ within the modernist era (1890 - 1940, approximately). As {{a basis for}} this discussion I have chosen the works of Virginia Woolf’s Mrs Dalloway and T. S. Eliot’s The Waste Land. Through the analysis of these works I discuss at {{what it means to}} be human in a secularized, and rapidly evolving modern society, as well as the consequences these factors may have on the modern individual. <b>My</b> <b>aim</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> thesis is to show that modernist literature, as represented by Woolf and Eliot, highlights this ‘spiritual vacuum’ and a possible search for spirituality, through the particularity of the modernist literary form. Thus, in order to conduct such a discussion, I seek aid in the theories of Martha Nussbaum, and her emphasis on emotions both within the narrative frame, and on its outside. ‘The Search for Spirituality within British Modernism’ is a search for meaning and self-worth in a time where man appeared lost within the ‘newness’ of the modern world. Eliot and Woolf show us a search where the value of the self, the value of literature in itself – and above all – the value of humanism, all aid in providing a meaningful existence for modern man...|$|E

The interviews focused on the parent’s description of their experience of how much influence on the work in their child's pre-school. The interviewed parent’s have experience from six different pre-schools, two of which are specially adapted to suit the needs of disabled children. The study comprise of preschools that handle children who are 1 – 5 years old, since that's where most children are today, when their parents are at work or at school. The parents want to maintain a close relationship to their pre-school. They also want to feel that they are a part of their children’s daily life at the pre-school.

40|$|This project investigates {{representations}} of the sky, atmosphere and weather in Western art in order to ascertain {{the effectiveness of the}} metaphorical use of atmosphere to convey notions of loss and transience. The exegesis examines the historical representation and meaning of the sky and atmospheric phenomena in Western visual art. This includes a critique of Romanticism and the philosophies of the Sublime. The research explores the conceptual underpinnings of the visual depiction of the sky and weather and the philosophical and socio-political discourse within which these works have been framed. It focuses on the differences between the visual apprehension of ‘the sky’ in the Romantic era and the twenty-first century. This research is informed conceptually and methodologically by phenomenology and focuses on contemporary artists whose practice incorporates phenomenological philosophies, collaboration with science and issues of identity. Contemporary German philosopher Gernot Böhme’s new aesthetics and the affective power of atmosphere have been influential in determining the outcomes of this research project. Böhme’s concept of atmosphere proposes a new way of overcoming dualism and intertwining environmental qualities and human states of being. It seeks to overturn the beauty versus the sublime dichotomy and allows for beauty, emotions and feelings to be incorporated back into aesthetics. Two locations were selected in which to conduct field-work for this project: one in the southern hemisphere in Australia, and the other in Scandinavia in the northern hemisphere. This provided a global perspective as well as an opportunity {{to examine the relationship between}} place and identity. I propose that the sky and atmospheric phenomena can act as a powerful metaphor for notions of change and loss. The exegetical research establishes that there is a direct relationship between the way in which the sky is depicted and a society’s cultural beliefs regarding its attitude to nature. The work for the creative component of this project has been derived directly from my embodied physical engagement with the environment and it is intended to express an inner sense of sadness and melancholy about what I am presently witnessing. <b>My</b> <b>aim</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> project is to communicate a sense of loss and an awareness of what we are losing and to encourage further discourse surrounding the looming existential crisis we are facing globally due to the effects of climate change...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Online health {{communities}} {{can offer a}} range of diverse personal health expertise and experiences, yet gathering relevant health information is a significant challenge for members and researchers as each party faces different obstacles. For instance, members face challenges that pertain to text based computer-mediated communication (CMC) and information availability {{as determined by the}} active participation of other members. Similarly, the challenge of making sense of vast amounts of text prevents researchers from reaping the full benefits of the collective knowledge. In my dissertation, I examine the challenges of gathering health information from online health communities in two parts according to the respective stakeholders. I first address the challenge that patient members face during their time of interaction with the online community to gather information. Within the context of CMC in online health communities, I focus on issues associated with topic changes–topic drift—and sustainment of active participation–posting messages to participate in the communities. Next, I address the challenge of processing and making sense of a large amount of collective knowledge shared in online health communities. Within the context of patient-generated text in online cancer communities, I focus on the challenges of automatically understanding patient-generated text using existing natural language processing (NLP) tools. More specifically, <b>my</b> specific <b>aims</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> dissertation are: 1. 	Understand topic drift and its effect on gathering health information from online health communities 2. 	Understand the beneficial effects of vocabulary similarity–homophily of vocabulary usage—associated with active participation in online health communities 3. 	Understand the challenges of automatically processing online community text and automated methods to detect failures I examine these specific aims using two distinct online health communities: cancerconnect. com (a small, private online health community for patients {{with a wide range of}} cancers) and webmd. com (a large, public online health community with many non-cancer, disease-specific sub-communities). One of the most important findings I discovered is that many members of online communities are willing to go the extra mile to help others in similar situations. Yet, many challenges are hindering the experience of gathering health information from online health communities. Although these efforts leave a digital trace that is embedded with diverse personal health expertise and experiences, we still lack the capability to automatically utilize this invaluable information. I contribute to resolving the issues faced by members and researchers; thereby, maximizing the benefits of online health communities and improving the experience of gathering health information from them. I extend the existing knowledge related to topic drift, sustaining active participation, and processing patient-generated text with respect to the experience of gathering health information from online health communities...|$|R

40|$|<b>My</b> <b>aim</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> thesis will be {{to analyze}} one {{small portion of the}} social impact that {{football}} has had in the terms of political ideology. The thesis will be about how football was regulated and 'politicized' during the 40 or so years of communism in Bulgaria and more specifically what were the signs that politicized it. A lot of changes happened after the socialist revolution of 1944 that were meant to seem as if they promoted political equality and freedom. The promotion that happened were mainly, based on uniting people’s identity with a communist ideology through BCP (Българска Комунистическа Партия/Bulgarian Communist Party). The 'puzzle' or problem is that even though the changes did have some positive effect on uniting Bulgarians under a certain ideology what also happened was significant protest against the regime. This thesis will go deeper and show how the BCP used the football club of CSKA to uphold the ideology of communism as victorious and glorious between 1944 and 1989. Various political connotations were linked with the image of CSKA. These connotations were linked not only with the socialist ideology and BCP, but also with signifiers that supported the ideology as the most powerful and successful one. I will see what kind of organizational changes happened to Bulgarian football, and how they were set to make CSKA the champion and the people’s favourite, whilst being a constant threats to rivals. With this I will also answer a question that has been on many Bulgarian’s lips, 'Why was CSKA supported by the BCP so fiercely?' By the end of the thesis my aim is to show how the political theories of Ernesto Laclau can be used to analyze what happened in Bulgaria. And as mentioned above my personal, will is to show how sports and football have a place in academic studies regarding politics. I will use the works of Bulgarian authors like Georgi Markov, to show how many of the symbols and signifiers that were associated with the socialist ideology were also present in football on a microcosmic level. Using Lacla’s theories on hegemony and empty signifiers I will try to explain how many of these signifiers were 'emptied' as such to link the football club of CSKA with that of the political party BCP. Also there were many regulations done to insure that CSKA, a signifier for socialist ideology, would be the dominant force in Bulgarian football. I will start out by giving a historical background of Bulgarian socialism, where I present some of the symbols and institutions that made the ideology what it was. Then move on to a history of political theories from selected authors. I will end my essay by showing how CSKA also came to stand for the symbols noted in the beginning, and how using the theories we can analyze why was it so...|$|E
