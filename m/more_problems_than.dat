5|$|The Tempest {{presents}} {{relatively few}} textual problems {{in comparison with}} many of Shakespeare's other plays. First published in the First Folio in December 1623, the play is first in the volume, leading the section of comedies. The play has more stage directions than any of Shakespeare's other plays, though {{they appear to have}} been written for readers instead of actors. Scholars infer from this that the editors of the volume, John Heminges and Henry Condell, included the directions to aid readers, and they were not necessarily Shakespeare's. Scholars have also wondered about the masque in Act 4, which some think was an interpolated afterthought, possibly added for the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick V in 1613. However, other scholars see this as unlikely, arguing that taking the masque out of the play creates <b>more</b> <b>problems</b> <b>than</b> it solves.|$|E
5|$|VR {{has given}} mixed {{statements}} about the fault-sensitivity of the train. Pentti Kuokkanen, project coordinator of VR Engineering downplayed the problems when questioned about the reliability of another Fiat Ferroviaria multiple unit, the Sm4, in 1999. According to him, the Pendolino had been VR's most reliable passenger train during winter 1998–1999. In 2006, VR's CEO Henri Kuitunen affirmed that the Pendolino was causing serious image problems to VR Group. In 2010, the company's head of traffic control Mauno Haapala stated that the Sm3 was not more fault-sensitive than their other trains. However during winter 2011, VR Group's head of service and production department Pertti Saarela gave a totally different answer, saying that Pendolinos {{are more prone to}} failures especially during winter. It is impossible to know if the train has <b>more</b> <b>problems</b> <b>than</b> VR's other rolling stock, as the company does not give out punctuality statistics for specific train types.|$|E

25|$|The {{logistics}} {{in which}} the delivery of humanitarian occurs can be problematic. For example, an earthquake in 2003 in Bam, Iran left {{tens of thousands of}} people in need of disaster zone aid. Although aid was flown in rapidly, regional belief systems, cultural backgrounds and even language seemed to have been omitted as a source of concern. Items such as religiously prohibited pork, and non-generic forms of medicine that lacked multilingual instructions came flooding in as relief. An implementation of aid can easily be problematic, causing <b>more</b> <b>problems</b> <b>than</b> it solves.|$|E
25|$|The more {{reliable}} Dez Cadena – another fan – then joined as a vocalist. With Cadena on board, Black Flag began national touring in earnest, and arguably saw two peaks: {{first as a}} commercial draw (they sold out the 3,500-seat Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, a feat they {{were never able to}} manage again); and second, perhaps seeing the peak of attention from police in the Los Angeles area, due to the violence associated with Black Flag and punk rock in general. The band members have often insisted, however, that the police instigated far <b>more</b> <b>problems</b> <b>than</b> they solved.|$|E
25|$|Predictor {{models have}} {{consistently}} found that childhood trauma, chronic adversity, and familial stressors increase risk for PTSD {{as well as}} risk for biological markers of risk for PTSD after a traumatic event in adulthood. Experiencing bullying as a child or an adult has been correlated {{with the development of}} PTSD. Peritraumatic dissociation in children is a predictive indicator of the development of PTSD later in life. This effect of childhood trauma, which is not well understood, may be a marker for both traumatic experiences and attachment problems. Proximity to, duration of, and severity of the trauma make an impact, and interpersonal traumas cause <b>more</b> <b>problems</b> <b>than</b> impersonal ones.|$|E

25|$|For many {{children}} with CP, parents are {{heavily involved in}} self-care activities. Self-care activities, such as bathing, dressing, grooming, can be difficult for children with CP as self-care depends primarily on use of the upper limbs. For those living with CP, impaired upper limb function affects almost 50% of children and is considered the main factor contributing to decreased activity and participation. As the hands are used for many self-care tasks, sensory and motor impairments of the hands make daily self-care more difficult. Motor impairments cause <b>more</b> <b>problems</b> <b>than</b> sensory impairments. The most common impairment is that of finger dexterity, which {{is the ability to}} manipulate small objects with the fingers. Compared to other disabilities, people with cerebral palsy generally need more help in performing daily tasks.|$|E
25|$|The besiegers had <b>more</b> <b>problems</b> <b>than</b> {{they had}} {{expected}} {{at the start of}} the siege. During the first days of October there was a huge storm. The camp in the northwest was sited in a traditionally flooded area, and turned into a swamp. The defenders took advantage of the confusion created by the storm to attack during the night, causing extensive damage. Floods in the camp and in the encircling lines required the headquarters and the larger part of the troops to move to the mouth of the river Palmones, where they spent the remainder of October 1342. Soon after the main Christian camp had moved, the Algecireños gathered all their forces in the Villa Vieja to make a desperate attack against their besiegers. The Muslim knights were able to reach the newly established Christian camp and kill many Christian knights including Gutier Díaz de Sandoval and Lope Fernández de Villagrand, vassals of Joan Núñez and Ruy Sánchez de Rojas, vassal of the Master of Santiago.|$|E

500|$|Although a {{prolific}} describer of species, his legacy to myriapod taxonomy has been mixed. Many of Chamberlin's descriptions of centipedes and millipedes were often brief and/or unillustrated, or illustrated in ways which hindered {{their use in}} identification by other researchers. He described some new species based solely on location, or on subtle leg differences now known to change during molting, and many of Chamberlin's names have subsequently been found to be, or are suspected to be, synonyms of species already described. Biologist Richard Hoffman, who worked with Chamberlin on the 1958 checklist, later described Chamberlin as [...] "an exemplar of minimal taxonomy", and stated his taxonomic work on Central American myriapods [...] "introduced far <b>more</b> <b>problems</b> <b>than</b> progress, a pattern which was to persist for many decades to come". Hoffman wrote Chamberlin was [...] "an admitted 'alpha taxonomist' [...] whose main interest was naming new species", although recognized Chamberlin's work with stone centipedes as pioneering, and of a quality unmatched in Chamberlin's later work.|$|E
500|$|In the meantime, it {{had been}} widely {{accepted}} that the 1950 change to the Stockholm Code caused <b>more</b> <b>problems</b> <b>than</b> they solved, and in 1981, the Sydney Code reinstated the validity of pre-1801 names, but created the status of sanctioned name for those used in the foundational works of Persoon and Elias Magnus Fries. Thus Entoloma sinuatum, which Fries had sanctioned, still had {{to be used for}} the species described by Quélet even though Bulliard's name was the older one. At about the same time, Machiel Noordeloos re-examined Bulliard's name in more details, and discovered that not only was it illegitimate (and thus not available for use) because William Hudson had already used it ten years earlier for a different species, but Bulliard's illustration was clearly not an Entoloma, but a species of Pluteus, a genus that is only distantly related to Entoloma. As this made Quélet's name definitely unusable for the Entoloma, and because at the time he and Romagnesi believed there were ground to treat Quélet's [...] "E. lividum" [...] and Persoon's E. sinuatum as separate species, he had to coin a third name for Quélet's species: Entoloma eulividum. He however later changed his mind on this issue, combining again his own Entoloma eulividum and E.sinuatum, so that Persoon's name is now universally recognised. Because it was previously widely used and Quélet had provided a good description and illustration (which, the proposer argued, was better considered as a new species rather than a mere placement of Bulliard's name in another genus), a proposal was made in 1999 to conserve Entoloma lividum and thus restore its use. However, it failed because E. sinuatum had already been in use (if not universally) for many years and was thus a well-known name for the species.|$|E

2500|$|He {{declined}} to reassess the alternative, objective test of entrapment proposed by Justice Owen Roberts in his Sorrells concurrence, {{that the focus}} should be on how the government acted rather than the defendant's state of mind. He believed that such a focus would unnecessarily burden prosecutors as {{they would not be}} able to raise predisposition in response to any defense attempt to examine police conduct; and that lower courts had ruled that juries should be allowed to consider entrapment, not judges as Roberts had proposed. [...] "To dispose of this case on the ground suggested would entail both overruling a leading decision of this Court and brushing aside the possibility that we would be creating <b>more</b> <b>problems</b> <b>than</b> we would supposedly be solving," [...] he said in conclusion.|$|E
2500|$|Bitter {{conflicts}} between Christians and Druzes, {{which had been}} simmering under Ibrahim Pasha's rule (mostly centered on the firmans of 1839 and later more decisively, of 1856, which equalized the status of Muslim and non-Muslim subjects, the former resenting the implied loss of superiority) resurfaced under the new emir. Hence, the sultan deposed Bashir III, on 13 January 1842, and appointed Umar Pasha as governor of Mount Lebanon. This appointment, however, created <b>more</b> <b>problems</b> <b>than</b> it solved. Representatives of the European powers proposed to the sultan that Lebanon be partitioned into Christian and Druze sections. On 7 December 1842, the sultan adopted the proposal and asked the governor of Damascus to divide the region into two districts: a northern district under a Christian deputy governor and a southern district under a Druze deputy governor. This arrangement {{came to be known}} as the [...] "Double Qaimaqamate". Both officials were to be responsible to the governor of Sidon, who resided in Beirut. The Beirut-Damascus highway was the dividing line between the two districts.|$|E
2500|$|For costumes, {{flat storage}} may create <b>more</b> <b>problems</b> <b>than</b> it solves, {{since it is}} {{impossible}} to store them in this manner without forming folds and creases. [...] Therefore, unless the costume is so weakened that it cannot support its own weight, hanging storage is perhaps the best option. [...] Costumes which are unusually heavy (heavily beaded gowns, for instance), or those whose fabric may distort easily (such as some stretch fabrics, or those cut on the bias) should also be stored in flat storage. [...] Garments suitable for hanging should be placed on plastic hangers which have been padded to mimic the shape of human shoulders, and covered with a plastic or cloth cover with an open bottom to allow air circulation while keeping the costume clean. [...] Wooden hangers may have a high acid content, which may cause discolouration or decay to the costume. [...] Likewise, metal hangers do not provide sufficient support, and may lead to distortion of the garments’ shoulders. [...] Therefore, both forms of hanging should be avoided.|$|E
