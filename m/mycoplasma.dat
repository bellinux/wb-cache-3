5|$|Several diseases, like Rat Coronavirus Infection (RCI), Sendai virus, and Murine Respiratory Mycoplasmosis (MRM, <b>Mycoplasma</b> pulmonis), are {{prevalent}} {{simply because}} their highly contagious natures work {{in tandem with}} the way rats are kept in laboratories, pet stores, and by breeders.

Bacterial cells are about one-tenth the size of eukaryotic cells and are typically 0.5–5.0micrometres in length.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that mycoplasma-infected cells are more sensitive to lysis by natural cytotoxic (NC) effector cells and that splenic NC cells release tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) when they lyse sensitive target cells. Here we showed that spleen cells released TNF-alpha when they were incubated with NC-sensitive cells that were infected with <b>mycoplasmas</b> or when they were incubated with <b>mycoplasmas</b> alone, but did not release TNF-alpha when incubated with NC-sensitive cells that were not infected with <b>mycoplasmas.</b> Thus, in the presence of <b>mycoplasmas,</b> spleen cell cultures contain both NC effector cells and free TNF-alpha. Because NC-sensitive cells are also sensitive to free TNF-alpha, when mycoplasma-infected cells were incubated with spleen cells, they were lysed by the combination of NC cells and free TNF-alpha. When NC-sensitive cells that were not infected with <b>mycoplasmas</b> were incubated with spleen cells, they were lysed only by NC effector cells and thus appeared to be less sensitive than mycoplasma-infected cells. These results also suggested that the release of TNF-alpha may be part of a host protective response to <b>mycoplasmas...</b>|$|R
40|$|IT {{is known}} that <b>mycoplasmas</b> may be {{preserved}} in the frozen state, although {{there is only one}} report (Kelton, 1964) concerning the viability of a variety of <b>mycoplasmas</b> after their long-term storage.

5|$|Spiroplasma is a cell wall–deficient {{bacterium}} {{related to}} <b>Mycoplasma,</b> which some think {{may be the}} cause of the TSEs.

5|$|Although {{polyadenylation}} is seen {{in almost}} all organisms, it is not universal. However, the wide distribution of this modification {{and the fact that}} it is present in organisms from all three domains of life implies that the last universal common ancestor of all living organisms, it is presumed, had some form of polyadenylation system. A few organisms do not polyadenylate mRNA, which implies that they have lost their polyadenylation machineries during evolution. Although no examples of eukaryotes that lack polyadenylation are known, mRNAs from the bacterium <b>Mycoplasma</b> gallisepticum and the salt-tolerant archaean Haloferax volcanii lack this modification.|$|E

40|$|<b>Mycoplasmas</b> {{as human}} {{urogenital}} tract pathogens {{are associated with}} infections, reproductive failures and adverse pregnancy outcomes and thus very important to diagnose. Several methods {{have been used to}} detect genitourinary <b>Mycoplasmas,</b> each having their own limitations, advantages and disadvantages. In the present study, researchers used microbial culture and PCR to detect <b>Mycoplasmas</b> in urogenital specimens with the aim of comparing detection rate, sensitivity and specificity of the two methods. It was a descriptive cross sectional pilot study. About 30 urogenital samples including 17 vaginal swabs, 7 male urine and 6 female urine samples were collected from patients referring to hospitals regardless of their disease and studied for <b>Mycoplasmas</b> by culture (using two media: PPLO agar and PPLO broth) and PCR. Of total 30 specimens, <b>Mycoplasmas</b> were detected in 14, 11 and 11 of them using PPLO broth culture medium, PPLO agar culture medium and PCR, respectively. Accordingly, the specificity and specificity of the PCR Method was determined 100 and 95 %, respectively while culture was found to have a sensitivity of 77 % and specificity of 66 %.

40|$|Inhibition of the mitotic {{reaction}} of lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) by certain species of <b>mycoplasmas</b> {{was described by}} Copperman and Morton (1). These investigators showed that suspensions of whole <b>mycoplasmas,</b> as well as aqueous extracts of frozen-thawed organisms (2), prevented the reaction while {{in contact with the}} cells; reactivity was restored when the lymphocytes were washed. In view of the ubiquity of <b>mycoplasmas</b> as contaminants of most tissue culture lines, as well as the possibility that these agents may play roles still unrecognized in the pathogenesis of disease, it is of importance to determine the mechanism underlying this phenomenon. Recent reports have suggested that the <b>mycoplasmas</b> inhibit lymphocyte transformation by competitive metabolism of arginine (3, 4, 5). The present report presents additional evidence that the arg~nlne dihydrolase enzyme system of <b>mycoplasmas</b> is responsible for lymphocyte inhibition. It will also be shown that the response of lymphocytes to antigenic st/mulation is similarly inhibited, and the in vitro production of antibody by lymph node explants is prevented.

5|$|Organisms vary {{in their}} ability to {{synthesize}} the 20 common amino acids. Most bacteria and plants can synthesize all twenty, but mammals can only synthesize eleven nonessential amino acids, so nine essential amino acids must be obtained from food. Some simple parasites, such as the bacteria <b>Mycoplasma</b> pneumoniae, lack all amino acid synthesis and take their amino acids directly from their hosts. All amino acids are synthesized from intermediates in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, or the pentose phosphate pathway. Nitrogen is provided by glutamate and glutamine. Amino acid synthesis depends on the formation of the appropriate alpha-keto acid, which is then transaminated to form an amino acid.|$|E

40|$|<b>Mycoplasmas</b> are {{frequently}} found as contaminants in tissue-cultured cells. Infections may be inapparent or cause severe cytopathic changes.

They cleave thymidine and its related structural inhibitors and also degrade arginine. They inhibit the growth of adenovirus and Rous sarcoma virus and no doubt affect others. A number of antibiotics which are relatively non-toxic for cells in culture are active against <b>mycoplasmas</b> and may be used to cure infected cells. <b>Mycoplasmas</b> interfere with the biochemistry of the cell at many points and no one working with tissue cultures can afford to ignore them.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{study the}} {{occurrence}} of <b>mycoplasmas</b> and ureaplasmas in patients with hypogammaglobulinaemia {{and the relationship of}} these micro-organisms to septic arthritis. METHODS [...] Over a period of about 20 years, 53 men and 38 women with hypogammaglobulinaemia, most of whom were less than 50 years old, were examined clinically and microbiologically. <b>Mycoplasmas</b> and ureaplasmas were sought in the throat, urogenital tract and joints by standard cultural methods, although not consistently in the three sites of all patients. RESULTS [...] Arginine-hydrolysing <b>mycoplasmas</b> and ureaplasmas occurred with similar frequency in the sputum/throat of the hypogammaglobulinaemic patients, but no more often than might be expected in immunocompetent patients. Ureaplasmas, however, dominated in the urogenital tracts of both men and women, being found in 75 % of vaginal specimens. Arginine-hydrolysing <b>mycoplasmas</b> occurred two to six times more frequently and ureaplasmas two to three times more frequently in urine specimens from hypogammaglobulinaemic patients than they did in such specimens from sex- and age-matched non-venereal disease, hospital patients or healthy subjects; these differences were statistically significant (p < 0. 05). Enhanced mucosal colonisation probably increases the chance of spread to distant sites, such as the joints. Of the 91 patients, 21 (23 %) had septic arthritis involving one or more joints. <b>Mycoplasmas</b> and/or ureaplasmas, but not bacteria, were isolated from the joints of eight (38 %) of these patients. However, dissemination to joints apparently had not occurred in some despite the opportunity by virtue of mycoplasmal or ureaplasmal colonisation at a mucosal site. Sometimes antibiotic therapy failed clinically, and microbiologically and recommendations for management are outlined. CONCLUSIONS [...] Hypogammaglobulinaemic patients appear to be more susceptible to colonisation of mucous membranes, especially of the urogenital tract, with <b>mycoplasmas</b> and ureaplasmas than are immunocompetent individuals. These micro-organisms are responsible for about two fifths of the septic arthritides occurring in these patients...|$|R
