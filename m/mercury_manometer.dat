Bottazzi, like Lombroso and Richet, was aware that he had entered upon a long road. He knew that a tired or worried medium was helpless. He called the same circle together for the 20th, willing to try patiently for developments. All came but Lombardi, whose place was taken by M. Jona, an engineer. The second sitting was a wonder.

He was resolute to force 'John,' the supposed 'guide,' to touch the electric button and press the ball of India-rubber that connected with a <b>mercury</b> <b>manometer.</b> He intended to teach the spirit hand to register its actions on a revolving cylinder of smoked tin. He wanted graven records, so that no wiseacre like Harris, here, could say: 'Oh, the thing never moved. You were all hypnotized!'

All I ask is that the bulb of a self-registering manometer be pressed. They say a Morse telegraphic key has been sounded by spirit hands.

5000|$|Arguably, Cushing's {{greatest}} contribution {{came with}} {{his introduction to}} North America of blood pressure measurement. Upon visiting colleague Scipione Riva-Rocci, an Italian physician, Cushing was astonished by Riva-Rocci's non-invasive way of measuring intra-arterial pressure. In 1896, Riva-Rocci developed a wall-mounted <b>mercury</b> <b>manometer</b> linked to a balloon-inflated cuff that would measure the pressure needed to compress arterial systolic pressure, i.e. systolic blood pressure measurement. Riva-Rocci's design {{was based on a}} more primitive version developed by French physician Pierre Potain. Cushing returned to the USA with a sample of Riva-Rocci's sphygmomanometer and blood pressure measurement became a vital sign. The use of the Riva-Rocci sphygmomanometer as a diagnostic tool rapidly spread across the US and western world, a direct contribution by Harvey Cushing. The device's use continued until Russian physician Nikolai Korotkov included diastolic blood pressure measurement in 1905 (after he discovered the famed [...] "Korotkoff sounds") with his improved sphygmomanometer, which also replaced the <b>mercury</b> <b>manometer</b> with a smaller, round dial manometer. Cushing's name is commonly associated with his most famous discovery, Cushing's disease. In 1912 he reported in a study an endocrinological syndrome caused by a malfunction of the pituitary gland which he termed [...] "polyglandular syndrome."

40|$|Characterisation of soil water, in {{particular}} water flow dynamics is fundamental {{in assessing the}} environmental implications to soil management. Soil water characterisation was assessed by measuring soil water content and soil water potential in a draining profile of sandy and loamy soils. <b>Mercury</b> <b>manometers</b> and Neutron probe meter were connected to a 1. 2 m high metal-reinforced container filled with soil samples, to simultaneously measure soil water potential and volumetric water content, respectively. Soil water contents (SWC) were found to decrease monotonically with time, with a rapid decrease in the first 50 hrs of free drainage in both soils. Sandy soil was more prone to huge losses of water than loamy soil attributed to numerous large drainable pores in sandy soil. An appreciable difference of SWC in the upper layer (SWC = 0. 22 cm 3 /cm 3) and the bottom layer (SWC = 0. 35 cm 3 /cm 3), {{in the case of}} loamy soil was attributable to its poor drainage properties.

50|$|A McLeod gauge {{isolates}} {{a sample}} of gas and compresses it in a modified <b>mercury</b> <b>manometer</b> until the pressure is a few millimetres of mercury. The technique is slow and unsuited to continual monitoring, but is capable of good accuracy. Unlike other manometer gauges, the McLeod gauge reading {{is dependent on the}} composition of the gas since the interpretation relies on the sample compressing as an ideal gas. Due to the compression process, the McLeod gauge completely ignores partial pressures from non-ideal vapors that condense, such as pump oils, mercury, and even water if compressed enough.|$|E

50|$|Trevithick's {{response}} was to incorporate two safety valves into future designs, only one {{of which could be}} adjusted by the operator. The adjustable valve comprised a disc covering a small hole {{at the top of the}} boiler above the water level in the steam chest. The force exerted by the steam pressure was equalised by an opposite force created by a weight attached to a pivoted lever. The position of the weight on the lever was adjustable thus allowing the operator to set the maximum steam pressure. Trevithick also added a fusible plug of lead, positioned in the boiler just below the minimum safe water level. Under normal operation the water temperature could not exceed that of boiling water and kept the lead below its melting point. If the water ran low, it exposed the lead plug, and the cooling effect of the water was lost. The temperature would then rise sufficiently to melt the lead, releasing steam into the fire, reducing the boiler pressure and providing an audible alarm in sufficient time for the operator to damp the fire, and let the boiler cool before damage could occur. He also introduced the hydraulic testing of boilers, and the use of a <b>mercury</b> <b>manometer</b> to indicate the pressure.|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{measurement}} of arterial {{blood pressure is}} of great importance for the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} hypertension. Because of the chronic nature of antihypertensive drug therapy, the involvement of the patient in blood pressure control is desirable. Such an involvement, however, is only feasible if simple, user-friendly, and precise blood pressure measurement devices are available. In this study we tested a new wrist cuff oscillometric blood pressure measurement device in 100 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. Blood pressures were simultaneously taken intraarterially (axillary artery) and with a <b>mercury</b> <b>manometer</b> and stethoscope or noninvasive measurement device (OMRON R 3). Intraarterial measurements were directly compared with two measurements taken in random order with either an arm cuff <b>mercury</b> <b>manometer</b> or the wrist cuff device. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure as assessed with the <b>mercury</b> <b>manometer</b> was higher, especially when compared with the intraarterial and the wrist cuff values, which were comparable. Correlations of blood pressure values with intraarterial measurement were 0. 86 systolic and 0. 75 diastolic (P <. 01) for the wrist cuff and 0. 84 systolic (P <. 01) and 0. 59 diastolic (P <. 05) for the <b>mercury</b> <b>manometer</b> measurements.

Both methods overestimated high diastolic values, whereas only the wrist cuff underestimated high systolic values. Thus, the new oscillometric wrist cuff blood pressure measurement device measures arterial blood pressure with great accuracy and reproducibility. As compared with intraarterial values, the wrist cuff device overestimated high diastolic and underestimated high systolic blood pressure values. Blood pressure values as measured by the <b>mercury</b> <b>manometer</b> were higher than intraarterial values and those of the wrist cuff.

50|$|Hydrostatic gauges (such as the <b>mercury</b> column <b>manometer)</b> {{consist of}} a {{vertical}} column of liquid in a tube whose ends are exposed to different pressures.

Any fluid can be used, but mercury is preferred for its high density and low vapour pressure. Simple hydrostatic gauges can measure pressures ranging from 1 torr (100 Pa) to above atmospheric. An important variation is the McLeod gauge which isolates a known volume of vacuum and compresses it to multiply the height variation of the liquid column. The McLeod gauge can measure vacuums as high as 10−6 torr (0.1 mPa), which is the lowest direct measurement of pressure that is possible with current technology. Other vacuum gauges can measure lower pressures, but only indirectly by measurement of other pressure-controlled properties.
