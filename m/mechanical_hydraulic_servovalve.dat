40|$|As a key {{component}} of hydraulic control systems, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>servovalves</b> influence their performance significantly. Unpredictable self-excited noise inside <b>hydraulic</b> <b>servovalves</b> may cause instability and even failure. Being functional, with higher saturation magnetization and increased viscosity when exposed to a magnetic field, magnetic fluids (MFs) have been widely used in dampers, sealing, and biomedical treatment. In this paper, magnetic fluids are applied in the torque motor of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>servovalve</b> to exert damping and resistance for vibration and noise suppression. Construction of the torque motor armature with magnetic fluids is introduced and the forces due to magnetic fluids on the torque motor armature are studied. Based on a bi-viscosity-constituted relationship, a mathematical model of the damping force from magnetic fluids is built when magnetic fluids are filled in the working gaps of the torque motor. Measurements of the properties of an Fe 3 O 4 composite magnetic fluid are carried out to calculate the parameters of this mathematical model and to investigate the influence of magnetic fluids on the vibration characteristics of the armature assembly. The simulated and tested harmonic responses of the armature with and without magnetic fluids show the good suppression effects of magnetic fluids on the self-excited noise inside the servovalve...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{establishes}} a non linear dynamic {{model of a}} two-spool electro <b>hydraulic</b> <b>servovalve.</b> It provides {{the ability to control}} flow into and out of valves independently by two separate spools.

It is likely reduce the valve cost substantially, give higher degree of adjustment and greater safety. In this paper dynamic behavior in respect of armature deflection, spool displacement, chamber pressure, discharge and displacement of the actuator is analyzed using Matlab/Simulink to see if such a low cost servovalve can provide acceptable performance...|$|R

40|$|A warm gas {{thrust vector}} control system was studied to {{optimize}} the injection geometry for a specific engine configuration, and an injection valve was designed capable of meeting the base line requirements. To optimize injection geometry, studies were made to determine the performance effects of varying injection location, angle, port size, and port configuration. Having minimized the injection flow rate required, a warm gas valve was designed to handle the required flow. A direct drive <b>hydraulic</b> <b>servovalve</b> capable of operating with highly contaminated hydraulic fluid was designed.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} areas in the robotics industry is the development of robots capable of working in hazardous environments. As humans cannot safely or cheaply work in these environments, providing a high level of robotic functionality is important. Our work in this area focuses on a fault detection method known as analytical redundancy, or AR. In this paper we discuss the application to a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>servovalve</b> system of our novel rigorous nonlinear AR technique. AR is a model-based state-space technique that is theoretically guaranteed to derive the maximum number of independent tests of the consistency of sensor data with the system model and past control inputs. Conventional linear AR is only valid for linear sampled data systems. However, our new nonlinear AR (NLAR) technique maintains traditional linear AR’s mathematical guarantee to generate the maximum possible number of independent tests in the nonlinear domain. Thus NLAR allows us to gain the benefits of AR testing for nonlinear systems with both continuous and sampled data. National Science FoundationSandia National Laborator...|$|R
