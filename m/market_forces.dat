5|$|<b>Market</b> <b>Forces</b> was {{science fiction}} author Richard K. Morgan's third novel. His first two novels, Altered Carbon (2002) and Broken Angels (2003), {{were the first}} two parts of a trilogy later {{completed}} with Woken Furies (2005). That Takeshi Kovacs trilogy, hardboiled detective fiction set in the 25th century, gave Morgan a reputation for writing excellent action sequences along with a Philip K. Dick Award. Before the third part of the trilogy was published, Morgan worked on his idea for <b>Market</b> <b>Forces,</b> which he conceived of as a short story, then developed as a film script, then as a novel. At the time, Morgan was 38 years old living in Glasgow, Scotland. He has sold the filming rights to Altered Carbon to Warner Bros. (he would also sell the rights to <b>Market</b> <b>Forces</b> to Warner Bros.) allowing him to leave his job as an English teacher at the University of Strathclyde to focus on his writing career.|$|E

5|$|<b>Market</b> <b>Forces</b> was {{published}} by Gollancz in United Kingdom and Del Rey Books in North America. The hardcover was released simultaneously in 2004 along with the ebook and audiobook versions. The audiobook, read unabridged by Simon Vance {{was published}} by Tantor Media in CD and mp3 formats. A tradepaperback version was released by the same publishers in 2007. The book was awarded the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 2005 and nominated for the Arthur C.

5|$|The work of George Akerlof and Janet Yellen on {{efficiency}} wages {{based on}} notions of fairness {{provides an example}} of a feminist model of economic actors. In their work, agents are not hyperrational or isolated, but instead act in concert and with fairness, are capable of experiencing jealousy, and are interested in personal relationships. This work is based on empirical sociology and psychology, and suggests that wages can be influenced by fairness considerations rather than purely <b>market</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|E
5|$|First {{published}} in 2004 by Victor Gollancz Ltd, {{the book is}} Morgan's third novel, the first two {{being part of the}} Takeshi Kovacs series. <b>Market</b> <b>Forces</b> satirises corporate practices and globalisation and carries the theme of competition throughout the story. Violence is used {{as a metaphor for the}} mechanisms underlying capitalism and assumptions about haves and have-nots are challenged. It won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 2005 and was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award. Though book reviewers gave it a mixed reception, Morgan's descriptive writing and action sequences received praise.|$|E

30|$|Though {{a highly}} contested arena in {{education}} policy-making {{in the past}} 30  years, education vouchers, in theory and in practice, {{have been used by}} neoliberalists to induce ‘free’ market competition, remove the monopolistic privileges of public schools, and promote educational choice and student achievement (see Friedman 1962, 1997; Jencks 1970; Lee and Wong 2002). The PEVS works like other education voucher programmes for parents, because it too focuses on empowering them to unleash the vastest amount of <b>market</b> <b>force.</b> But instead of allowing schools to freely respond to the demand of parents, the <b>market</b> <b>force</b> is regulated, and hence helps promote the government’s direct involvement in the private sector, by implicitly directing the <b>market</b> <b>force</b> through limiting the vouchers to a restricted sector of the wholly private ECE market while explicitly tying financial assistance with official quality assessments. This defies the usual agenda of decentralising authority through the endorsement of <b>market</b> <b>force</b> in education vouchers.|$|R

5|$|Historically, {{competitive}} devaluations {{have been}} rare as countries have generally preferred {{to maintain a}} high value for their currency. Countries have generally allowed <b>market</b> <b>forces</b> to work, or have participated in systems of managed exchanges rates. An exception occurred when a currency war {{broke out in the}} 1930s when countries abandoned the gold standard during the Great Depression and used currency devaluations in an attempt to stimulate their economies. Since this effectively pushes unemployment overseas, trading partners quickly retaliated with their own devaluations. The period is considered to have been an adverse situation for all concerned, as unpredictable changes in exchange rates reduced overall international trade.|$|E
5|$|<b>Market</b> <b>Forces</b> is {{a science}} fiction thriller novel by Richard Morgan. Set in 2049, the story follows Chris Faulkner as he starts his new job as a junior {{executive}} at Shorn Associates, working in their Conflict Investment division where the company supports foreign governments {{in exchange for a}} percentage of the country's gross domestic product. Contracts are awarded, and promotions are given to employees, through driving duels in which combatants race vehicles on empty roads and often kill their opponents. With the Shorn-supported Colombian dictator Echevarria expected to transfer power to his son, who is supported by a competing firm, Chris allies Shorn with a rebel group to overthrow the government, though other executives attempt to sabotage his plans.|$|E
5|$|<b>Market</b> <b>Forces</b> is a science-fiction thriller set nearly {{fifty years}} after its writing {{featuring}} a protagonist who fights lethal battles to win contracts for his company and to retain his position within the company. While the story is fictional, the author included a bibliography section that informed the story's satire of globalisation and modern corporate practices. Morgan extrapolates trends in free market capitalism out fifty years {{to a point where}} corporations are unfettered by domestic governments. It is a dystopian vision where large corporations constantly battle to rule entire countries using humans as pawns. The protagonist, Chris Faulkner, {{can be viewed as a}} personification of the story's take on the development of its economic system; the character is written to be likeable but becomes increasing brutal as he invests himself deeper into the corporate culture.|$|E

5|$|Thatcher {{supported}} Lord Rothschild's 1971 {{proposal for}} <b>market</b> <b>forces</b> to affect government funding of research. Although many scientists opposed the proposal, her research background probably made her sceptical of their claim that outsiders should {{not interfere with}} funding. The department evaluated proposals for more local education authorities to close grammar schools and to adopt comprehensive secondary education. Although Thatcher was committed to a tiered secondary modern-grammar school system of education and attempted to preserve grammar schools, during her tenure as Education Secretary she turned down only 326 of 3,612proposals for schools to become comprehensives; the proportion of pupils attending comprehensive schools consequently rose from 32percent to 62percent.|$|E
5|$|A state {{wishing to}} devalue, {{or at least}} check the {{appreciation}} of its currency, must work within {{the constraints of the}} prevailing International monetary system. During the 1930s, countries had relatively more direct control over their exchange rates through the actions of their central banks. Following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s, markets substantially increased in influence, with <b>market</b> <b>forces</b> largely setting the exchange rates for an increasing number of countries. However, a state's central bank can still intervene in the markets to effect a devaluation – if it sells its own currency to buy other currencies then this will cause the value of its own currency to fall – a practice common with states that have a managed exchange rate regime. Less directly, quantitative easing (common in 2009 and 2010), tends to lead to a fall {{in the value of the}} currency even if the central bank does not directly buy any foreign assets.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, a brief boom in textile {{manufacture}} {{was followed}} by periods of chronic economic depression, particularly among textile weavers and spinners (the textile trade was concentrated in Lancashire). Weavers who could have expected to earn 15shillings for a six-day week in 1803, saw their wages cut to 5shillings or even 4s6d by 1818. The industrialists, who were cutting wages without offering relief, blamed <b>market</b> <b>forces</b> generated by the aftershocks of the Napoleonic Wars. Exacerbating matters were the Corn Laws, the first of which was passed in 1815, imposing a tariff on foreign grain in an effort to protect English grain producers. The cost of food rose as people were forced to buy the more expensive and lower quality British grain, and periods of famine and chronic unemployment ensued, increasing the desire for political reform both in Lancashire and in the country at large.|$|E

5|$|From {{the outset}} of his posting, Clarke {{had to deal with}} issues {{regarding}} land and labour. The latter was of major significance at this time in Southern Rhodesia. In response to questioning by the African Association and the Manchester Society for the Protection of Native Races, Chamberlain in 1898 responded that forced labour was not permitted. A year later, Chamberlain was concerned by a chief native commissioner instructing chiefs at an indaba that it was their duty to supply labour. Clarke's subsequent report accused officials of the administration of requisitioning labour by 'pressure only short of force', causing 'discontent amongst the natives'. Clarke's view was that a mutually beneficial relationship between capital and labour was possible through <b>market</b> <b>forces</b> alone, without additional pressure. Chamberlain agreed, although Milner was in favour of compulsory labour even to the extent of 'recommending the corvée'.|$|E
5|$|While {{some of the}} {{conditions}} to allow a currency war were in place at various points throughout this period, countries generally had contrasting priorities and at no point were there enough states simultaneously wanting to devalue for a currency war to break out. On several occasions countries were desperately attempting not to cause a devaluation but to prevent one. So states were striving not against other countries but against <b>market</b> <b>forces</b> that were exerting undesirable downwards pressure on their currencies. Examples include The United Kingdom during Black Wednesday and various tiger economies during the Asian crises of 1997. During the mid-1980s the United States did desire to devalue significantly, but were able to secure the cooperation of other major economies with the Plaza Accord. As free market influences approached their zenith during the 1990s, advanced economies and increasingly transition and even emerging economies moved {{to the view that}} it was best to leave the running of their economies to the markets and not to intervene even to correct a substantial current account deficit.|$|E
5|$|The Commercial Import Program {{was created}} in January 1955, {{immediately}} upon the transfer of France's remaining direct influence over the State of Vietnam to the chief of state, former Emperor Bảo Đại and his Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem. The Americans and Diem feared a communist electoral victory and national polls never took place. In October, Diem proclaimed himself {{the president of the}} newly formed Republic of Vietnam after he won a fraudulent referendum, and the aid continued as the US wanted to build a strong and stable anti-communist state in Southeast Asia. When the program was first introduced, it generated turbulence for merchant importers in Vietnam. As {{a large proportion of the}} imports up to that point had been from France, traders who were dependent on selling French products found themselves in difficulties as their wares would now be more expensive than those of import licenseholders who now had access to cheaper American alternatives. The suppliers of French goods threatened to organize a strike, but this never materialized. At the time, South Vietnam was also suffering from a lack of foreign currency reserves and the CIP was seen as an urgent mechanism of remedying this. The introduction of the CIP brought an unprecedented new level of economic liberalism and capitalism, and at first, the entrepreneurial class struggled to meet the challenges of a deregulated market, leading to a series of significant shortages and surpluses of various goods due to their inexperience in judging <b>market</b> <b>forces</b> and resultant imbalances in the economy. Initially 25,000 applications for import licenses were received, many from speculators. In the early years of the initiative, a proportion of the US funding for the CIP came through the proceeds of the sale of surplus American agricultural products to France.|$|E

5|$|The Resale Prices Bill was {{introduced}} to deny manufacturers and suppliers the power to stipulate the prices at which their goods must be sold by the retailer. At the time, up to forty per cent of goods sold in Britain were subject to such price fixing, {{to the detriment of}} competition and to the disadvantage of the consumer. Douglas-Home, less instinctively liberal on economic matters than Heath, would probably not have sponsored such a proposal unprompted. However, he gave Heath his backing, in the face of opposition from some cabinet colleagues, including Butler, Hailsham and Lloyd, and a substantial number of Conservative backbenchers. They believed the change would benefit supermarkets and other large retailers at the expense of proprietors of small shops. The government was forced to make concessions to avoid defeat. Retail price maintenance would continue to be legal for some goods; these included books, on which it remained in force until <b>market</b> <b>forces</b> led to its abandonment in 1995. Manufacturers and suppliers would also be permitted to refuse to supply any retailer who sold their goods at less than cost price, as a loss leader. The bill had a difficult Parliamentary passage during which the Labour party generally abstained, leaving the Conservatives to vote for or against their own government. The bill received the royal assent in July 1964, but did not become operative until 1965, by which time Douglas-Home, Heath and their colleagues were out of office.|$|E
