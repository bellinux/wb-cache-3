500|$|The {{wealth of}} species of {{well-known}} groups of animals demonstrates {{the depth of}} the biodiversity found at Marojejy National Park. [...] For example, 75 of the 118species of birds (64%) found in or around Marojejy are forest-dwelling birds, a total that surpasses any other mountain site in Madagascar. [...] All of these forest-dependent bird species are endemic to Madagascar and utilize the forest for some portion of their life-cycle. [...] One of these birds is the <b>Madagascar</b> <b>serpent-eagle</b> (Eutriorchis astur), which prior to being reported in 1990, had not been seen by ornithologists since 1932.|$|E
50|$|Masoala harbors {{many other}} novelties, {{such as the}} Madagascar day gecko, leaf-tailed gecko, {{chameleons}} of all sizes, spectacular birds such as the helmet vanga, and rare species such as the red owl and tomato frog. Masoala {{is also home to}} the spectacular day-flying sunset moth, Chrysiridia rhipheus. The <b>Madagascar</b> <b>serpent-eagle</b> was recently rediscovered here, and exists in healthy populations only in this part of north east Madagascar.|$|E

40|$|Two {{independent}} {{cases of}} visual mimicry involving snake-eating eagles as mimics {{and more powerful}} bird-eating hawks as models are proposed. One pair of species is formed by the sympatric West African Serpent-eagle Dryotriorchis spectabilis and Cassinâ€™s Hawk Eagle Spizaetus africanus (= Aquila africana), inhabiting the tropical forests of the African Gulf of Guinea. The second case involves the <b>Madagascar</b> <b>Serpent-eagle</b> Eutriorchis astur and the Madagascar Goshawk Accipiter henstii, both sympatric and endemics of forests in Madagascar. Similarity in plumage colour and pattern {{as well as in}} body size and proportions are remarkable in both cases. The species mimicry pairs are in both cases not closely related phylogenetically and greatly differ in diet, making it unlikely that common ancestry or shared foraging strategies explain the resemblance in plumage coloration and pattern. Mimicry may have evolved because the mimic serpent-eagles obtain (the following hypotheses are not mutually exclusive) : (1) a foraging advantage by deceiving their snake prey as they may not flee from bird-eating raptors such as the models, (2) a lowered predation or harassment by the models or other predators, and/or (3) reduced mobbing by small birds, which tend to avoid birdeating raptors. Alternatively, the similarities in plumage described here {{may be the result of}} random convergence due to constraints in the evolution of plumage colours and patterns in diurnal raptors.
