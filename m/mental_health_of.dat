5|$|Following the {{publication}} of a 2016 interdepartmental report into the issue of mental health in the justice system, McEntee stated her belief that it is unacceptable to send people with mental health issues to prison, and that {{this is an issue that}} must be tackled by the government. She also believes the government should address concerns about the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> unemployed young people.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, as he {{was writing}} Parts II and IV, Joyce's {{progress}} slowed considerably.

40|$|The {{economic}} crisis {{is expected to}} produce secondary <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> effects that may increase suicide and alcohol death rates. However, the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> effects <b>of</b> the {{economic crisis}} can be offset by social welfare and other policy measures. For example, active labour market programmes aimed at helping people retain or regain jobs counteract the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> effects <b>of</b> the economic crisis. Family support programmes contribute to counteracting the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> effects <b>of</b> the crisis. Increasing alcohol prices and restricting alcohol availability reduce the harmful effects on <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> and save lives.

5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of schizophrenia is antipsychotic medications, often {{in combination with}} psychological and social supports. Hospitalization may occur for severe episodes either voluntarily or (if mental health legislation allows it) involuntarily. Long-term hospitalization is uncommon since deinstitutionalization beginning in the 1950s, although it still occurs. Community support services including drop-in centers, visits by members of a community mental health team, supported employment and support groups are common. Some evidence indicates that regular exercise has {{a positive effect on}} the physical and <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> those with schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|By 1926 Joyce had {{completed}} the first {{two parts of the}} book. In that year, he met Eugene and Maria Jolas who offered to serialise the book in their magazine transition. For the next few years, Joyce worked rapidly on the new book, but in the 1930s, progress slowed considerably. This was due to a number of factors, including {{the death of his father}} in 1931, concern over the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> his daughter Lucia, and his own health problems, including failing eyesight. Much of the work was done with the assistance of younger admirers, including Samuel Beckett. For some years, Joyce nursed the eccentric plan of turning over the book to his friend James Stephens to complete, on the grounds that Stephens was born in the same hospital as Joyce exactly one week later, and shared the first name of both Joyce and of Joyce's fictional alter-ego, an example of Joyce's superstitions.|$|E
5|$|The {{extermination}} {{activities of}} the Einsatzgruppen generally followed a standard procedure, with the Einsatzgruppen chief contacting the nearest Wehrmacht unit commander to inform him of the impending action; this was done so they could coordinate and control access to the execution grounds. Initially the victims were shot, but this method proved impracticable for an operation of this scale. Also, after Himmler observed the shooting of 100 Jews at Minsk in August 1941, he grew concerned about the impact such actions were having on the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> his SS men. He decided that alternate methods of killing should be found, which led to introduction of gas vans. However, these were not popular with the men, because removing the dead bodies from the van and burying them was a horrible ordeal. Prisoners or auxiliaries were often assigned to do this task so as to spare the SS men the trauma.|$|E

5|$|The term {{maternal}} deprivation is a catch-phrase summarising {{the early}} work of psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, John Bowlby {{on the effects}} of separating infants and young children from their mother (or mother substitute) although the effect of loss of the mother on the developing child had been considered earlier by Freud and other theorists. Bowlby's work on delinquent and affectionless children and the effects of hospital and institutional care led to his being commissioned to write the World Health Organisation's report on the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> homeless children in post-war Europe whilst he was head of the Department for Children and Parents at the Tavistock Clinic in London after World War II. The result was the monograph Maternal Care and Mental Health published in 1951, which sets out the maternal deprivation hypothesis.|$|E
