5|$|In {{the ninth}} century Orcadian control {{stretched}} into <b>Moray,</b> {{which was a}} semi-independent kingdom {{for much of this}} early period. The <b>Moray</b> rulers MacBeth (1040–1057) and his successor Lulach (1057–1058) became rulers of the entire Scottish kingdom for a time. However, <b>Moray</b> was subjugated by the Scottish kings after 1130, when the native ruler, Óengus of <b>Moray</b> was killed leading a rebellion. Another revolt in 1187 was equally unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|In 1528, Margaret Tudor, now Regent of Scotland for {{her infant}} son James V, married Henry Stewart, 1st Lord Methven, a {{descendant}} of Albany. His brother, Sir James Stewart (c.1513–1554), was made Captain of Doune Castle, and Sir James' son, also James (c.1529–1590), was created Lord Doune in 1570. Lord Doune's son, another James (c.1565–1592), married Elizabeth Stuart, 2nd Countess of <b>Moray</b> around 1580, becoming Earl of <b>Moray</b> himself. The castle thus came to be the seat of its keepers, the Earls of <b>Moray,</b> who owned it until the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|If Malcolm {{exercised}} {{control over}} <b>Moray,</b> {{which is far}} from being generally accepted, then the annals record a number of events pointing to a struggle for power in the north. In 1020, Mac Bethad's father Findláech mac Ruaidrí was killed by the sons of his brother Máel Brigte. It seems that Máel Coluim mac Máil Brigti took control of <b>Moray,</b> for his death is reported in 1029.|$|E

He became Mormaer of <b>Moray</b> – a semi-autonomous lordship – in 1032, and was probably responsible for the death of the previous mormaer, Gille Coemgáin. He subsequently married Gille Coemgáin's widow, Gruoch, although they had no children together.|$|E

5|$|Mary's {{marriage}} to a leading Catholic precipitated Mary's half-brother, the Earl of <b>Moray,</b> to join with other Protestant lords, including Lords Argyll and Glencairn, in open rebellion. Mary set out from Edinburgh on 26 August 1565 to confront them, and on the 30th <b>Moray</b> entered Edinburgh, but left soon afterward having failed to take the castle. Mary returned to Edinburgh the following month to raise more troops. In {{what became known as}} the Chaseabout Raid, Mary and her forces and <b>Moray</b> and the rebellious lords roamed around Scotland without ever engaging in direct combat. Mary's numbers were boosted by the release and restoration to favour of Lord Huntly's son, and the return of James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, from exile in France. Unable to muster sufficient support, in October <b>Moray</b> left Scotland for asylum in England. Mary broadened her privy council, bringing in both Catholics (Bishop of Ross John Lesley and provost of Edinburgh Simon Preston of Craigmillar) and Protestants (the new Lord Huntly, Bishop of Galloway Alexander Gordon, John Maxwell of Terregles and Sir James Balfour).|$|E

5|$|The {{defeat of}} Domnall's {{rebellion}} {{led to more}} conflict between Earl Harald and King William. After 1187, it appears that Scots and Scotto-Norman nobles were being planted in Ross and in Cromarty, as had previously happened in <b>Moray.</b> The de Moravia family, anglicised as <b>Moray</b> or Murray, which later produced Andrew <b>Moray,</b> were granted lands in Ross and Cromarty, and {{they are unlikely to}} have been unique in this award. When King William fell ill in 1195, this may have been the catalyst for the final conflict with Harald, which lasted from 1197 until 1201. As part of this struggle, William granted lands in Caithness to Harald the Young, grandson of Rognvald Kali, in 1197. Harald the Young was killed by Harald Maddadsson the following year.|$|E

5|$|Domhnall was, reputedly, {{the son of}} Raghnall (fl. 1192) son of Somhairle (died 1164). The 17th-century History of the Macdonalds by Hugh MacDonald of Sleat {{claimed that}} Domhnall's father Raghnall had married a {{daughter}} or sister of the early 14th-century hero Thomas Randolph, Earl of <b>Moray.</b> Sellar suggested that this tradition may have derived from a garbled version of reality. Perhaps, Sellar argued, {{his mother was a}} daughter of William fitz Duncan. The latter was another famous Earl of <b>Moray,</b> but one who lived in the 12th- rather than the 14th-century.|$|E
5|$|From the Octagon, Princes Street {{initially}} rises as {{it passes}} through a commercial district formerly {{commonly known as the}} Top 100, crossing the outer Octagon of <b>Moray</b> Place before descending through the original cutting of Bell Hill towards the Exchange. The Top 100 theoretically takes its name from the 100 retail businesses which line Princes Street from the Octagon to the Exchange, although the actual number of businesses is not one hundred. This part of the city is sometimes seen as the creative heart of Dunedin, with numerous art galleries, video production companies, and the city's professional theatre (the Fortune Theatre) all being based in the area from <b>Moray</b> Place to Rattray Street.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} twelfth century, the Earldom of Orkney, {{although}} weakened {{since the time}} of Earl Thorfinn, remained in control of Caithness and was dominant in Sutherland and parts of the Outer Hebrides. Thus the succession of the earldom was of great interest to the Scots king David I. The marriage of Matad and Margaret is believed to have taken place not long before 1134, shortly following David's suppression of a major revolt involving Mormaer Óengus of <b>Moray,</b> grandson of king Lulach, and Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair, the illegitimate son of David's brother Alexander, and the subsequent extension of royal power into the provinces of <b>Moray</b> and Ross. David's nephew William fitz Duncan was appointed to rule <b>Moray,</b> and it has been proposed that Matad, whose power lay in the Scottish kingdom's heartland of Atholl, may also have been granted authority in the new lands north of the Mounth, and that his marriage to Margarat Haakonsdaughter was arranged with this in mind.|$|E
5|$|Letters in the Earl of Kincardine's papers {{show that}} William Bruce was {{in exile in}} Rotterdam during the 1650s with his cousin, Alexander Bruce, brother of the Earl of Kincardine. As Episcopalians, William and Alexander would have sought refuge from the Puritan Commonwealth {{established}} by Oliver Cromwell. In Rotterdam, they were in contact with Sir Robert <b>Moray,</b> a soldier and natural philosopher close to Charles II, who then resided at Maastricht. William Bruce was a merchant, based in the Scottish community in Rotterdam, but travelling widely. He owned a ship with Alexander Bruce and John Hamilton of Grange, and {{was involved in the}} trade of wine, coal and timber between Norway, France, England, Scotland and the Low Countries. He is recorded as having a house and a mistress in La Rochelle. He may have had a son Normand by this mistress, since in 1672 he figures as a witness to the baptism at Holyrood of a William Bruce, son of Normand Bruce, mason. Moreover, the marriage record of Normand Bruce states that he was employed at Balcaskie. In 1658, William and Alexander travelled together from Bremen overland to Maastricht to meet <b>Moray.</b> Alexander Bruce and <b>Moray</b> were founder members of the Royal Society in 1660, and it is likely that architecture featured in their discussions, particularly the new town hall in Maastricht that <b>Moray</b> had recently advised on.|$|E

5|$|The Old Red Sandstone Continent {{became a}} part of the supercontinent Pangaea in the Permian (299–252 Ma), during which proto-Britain {{continued}} to drift northwards. Scotland's climate was arid at this time and some fossils of reptiles have been recovered. However, Permian sandstones are found in only a few places - principally in the south west, on the island of Arran, and on the <b>Moray</b> coast.

5|$|The castle {{deteriorated}} {{through the}} 18th century, and by 1800 Doune was a roofless ruin. It remained so until the 1880s, when George Stuart, 14th Earl of <b>Moray</b> (1816–1895) began repair works. The timber roofs were replaced, and the interiors, including the panelling in the Lord's Hall, were installed. The castle is now maintained by Historic Scotland, having been donated to a predecessor organisation by Douglas Stuart, 20th Earl of <b>Moray,</b> in 1984, and {{is open to}} the public. The castle is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and is a Category A listed building, the highest levels of protection for nationally important built heritage in Scotland.|$|E
