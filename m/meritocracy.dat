40|$|We examine {{theoretically}} and experimentally how a society’s grouping and stratification rules affect {{incentives and}} efficiency, and compare meritocratic and ascriptive grouping. We present a multi-level model of social production, {{and extend the}} usual single-group-level analysis of cooperation to a broadly defined system, in which individuals compete for inclusion in stratified groups based on the contributions they make. Group members share their collective output equally amongst themselves. The mechanism has two pure strategy Nash equilibria, one close to Pareto optimal. The latter equilibrium is asymmetric and rather complex for experimental subjects. Nonetheless, subjects tacitly coordinate this equilibrium very reliably, demonstrating equilibrium’s predictive power and providing empirical support for payoff dominance. Our behavioral findings also point to a <b>meritocracy’s</b> “naturalness” and effectiveness in eliciting high social contributions. The results make a theoretical and empirical case for why social organization {{should be based on}} contribution rather than privilege. They also indicate why societies are increasingly becoming performance-based <b>meritocracies,</b> and are relevant to many forms of contemporary social organization...|$|R

5|$|During {{this period}} greater {{emphasis}} was laid upon {{the civil service}} system of recruiting officials; this was based upon degrees acquired through competitive examinations, {{in an effort to}} select the most capable individuals for governance. Selecting men for office through proven merit was an ancient idea in China. The civil service system became institutionalized on a small scale during the Sui and Tang dynasties, but by the Song period it became virtually the only means for drafting officials into the government. The advent of widespread printing helped to widely circulate Confucian teachings and to educate more and more eligible candidates for the exams. This {{can be seen in the}} number of exam takers for the low-level prefectural exams rising from 30,000 annual candidates in the early 11th century to 400,000 candidates by the late 13th century. The civil service and examination system allowed for greater <b>meritocracy,</b> social mobility, and equality in competition for those wishing to attain an official seat in government. Using statistics gathered by the Song state, Edward A. Kracke, Sudō Yoshiyuki, and Ho Ping-ti supported the hypothesis that simply having a father, grandfather, or great-grandfather who had served as an official of state did not guarantee one would obtain the same level of authority. Robert Hartwell and Robert P. Hymes criticized this model, stating that it places too much emphasis on the role of the nuclear family and considers only three paternal ascendants of exam candidates while ignoring the demographic reality of Song China, the significant proportion of males in each generation that had no surviving sons, and the role of the extended family. Many felt disenfranchised by what they saw as a bureaucratic system that favored the land-holding class able to afford the best education. One of the greatest literary critics of this was the official and famous poet Su Shi. Yet Su was a product of his times, as the identity, habits, and attitudes of the scholar-official had become less aristocratic and more bureaucratic with the transition of the periods from Tang to Song. At the beginning of the dynasty, government posts were disproportionately held by two elite social groups: a founding elite who had ties with the founding emperor and a semi-hereditary professional elite who used long-held clan status, family connections, and marriage alliances to secure appointments. By the late 11th century, the founding elite became obsolete, while political partisanship and factionalism at court undermined the marriage strategies of the professional elite, which dissolved as a distinguishable social group and was replaced by a multitude of gentry families.|$|E

As many theorists have argued, the long-term unemployed struggle to maintain self-esteem. We found that workfare projects that introduce them to voluntary work can help them regain self-respect through four types of emotional labour: feeling respected through their newfound status, enjoying a craft, being able to perform in less stressful working environments, and taking pride in the meaning bestowed by voluntary work. But the emotional labour necessary to experience their situation more positively also increases the risk of experiencing negative emotions, thereby posing new threats to the fragile self-respect of unemployed citizens...|$|R

There are an initiatives such as Outreachy that aim to support more women and other underrepresented gender identities to participate in open source software. However, within the discussion forums of open source projects the topic of gender diversity can be highly controversial and even inflammatory. A central vision in open source software is that because the software is built and maintained on the merit of individual code contributions, open source communities should act as a <b>meritocracy.</b> In a <b>meritocracy,</b> the importance of an individual in the community depends {{on the quality of}} their individual contributions and not demographic factors such as age, race, religion, or gender.

40|$|To {{review the}} history of the Gothic as a counter-Enlightenment discourse, albeit an {{ambivalent}} one, is to see the suitability, if not the inevitability, of the Gothic treatment of education and educators.

Ostensibly democratizing, leveling <b>meritocracies</b> that create conditions for social mobility and prepare students for citizenship in an egalitarian nation, American schools nevertheless remain resistant to democracy and often reproduce rather than challenge the existing class structure. They may, therefore, appear frustratingly classless to the elite and forbiddingly or tantalizingly aristocratic to the middle or working classes. Such tensions animate two works of the Schoolhouse Gothic, Edgar Allan Poe’s “William Wilson” (1839) and Donna Tartt’s The Secret History (1991), texts whose protagonists emerge from school damaged and dangerous, texts in which the promise of democratizing education becomes a grimly parodic threat...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{a society in}} which {{individuals}} gain utility from income and from social approbation. Income is correlated with class. Approbation is given to an unobservable trait, which must be signalled through the agent?s social mobility, i. e. class change. Mobility is driven by a simple mechanism involving inheritance, effort and ability. Thus social structure (class composition) is affected by individuals? quest for approbation, and we study how that affects the emergence and multiplicity of long run social organizations, including hybrid forms of dynasties and <b>meritocracies.</b> Specifically we observe that even though social mobility is driven purely by a meritocratic mechanism, pure dynasties can emerge. We then introduce a feedback between the size of the upper class and its income value, so that effort levels and social structure are jointly endogenous. We derive results on equilibrium effort levels and stationary (when they exist) social structures. Social organization can converge to a unique steady state, multiple long run equilibria or cycles. ...|$|R
40|$|Individuals with {{a higher}} social {{position}} are more tolerant of current income inequality than individuals with a lower social position. Besides this, attitudes towards income inequality are influenced by inequality-legitimising myths in a given society. Little is known about how these two factors interact. This study combines these two lines of research and argues that different social strata are more polarised in their attitudes towards inequality in societies with strong prevalent meritocratic perceptions. We expect lower-status individuals (i. e. with a lower income or education) to experience {{a threat to their}} group esteem and therefore be less likely to support their society’s inequalities in societies with such strong meritocratic perceptions. This hypothesis was tested using data from the International Social Survey Programme 2009 (Social Inequality) on 39 countries. The results show that different social strata are indeed more polarised in their attitudes towards inequality in societies where meritocratic perceptions are more prevalent. Our results are robust for income, but not for education. This suggests that in perceived <b>meritocracies,</b> people regard income as the primary indicator of effort and ability...|$|R
40|$|Universities present {{themselves}} as gender-neutral <b>meritocracies,</b> {{concerned with the}} creation and transmission of scientific, objective knowledge. Yet such structures are overwhelmingly male dominated (Husu, 2001 a). This article firstly outlines the gender profile of those in senior management in Irish universities; secondly explores {{the extent to which}} those in senior management see a gendered organisational culture or women themselves as ‘the problem’; and thirdly locates these patterns within a wider organisational and societal context. The qualitative data is derived from a purposive sample of 40 people in senior management (85 per cent response rate) from Presidential to Dean level; including academics and non-academics; men and women; and across a range of disciplines. It suggests that organisational culture is seen as homosocial, unemotional and conformist mainly but not exclusively by women; whereas men were more likely to focus on women as ‘the problem’. These trends reflect those in other studies (for example Currie and Thiele, 2001; Deem, 1999; Deem et al, 2008). Drawing on Grummell et al’s (2009) work, it suggests that homosociability is an important process in creating and maintaining these patterns. Furthermore, although the President is seen as having the power to affect the gender profile of senior management, there is ambivalence about him actually doing this. The extent to which other stakeholders seem likely to encourage this is also explored...|$|R
