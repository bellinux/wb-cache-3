5|$|After the war, on 18 March 1946, the 'double tenth' {{war crimes}} trial {{was held in}} the Supreme Court Building, before a <b>military</b> <b>court</b> presided over by Lieutenant Colonel S.

5|$|On 3 July 1945 Andersen {{killed two}} German {{prisoners of war}} with his Thompson submachine gun. Andersen had broken into German barracks in Vadheim in Sogn during a {{drinking}} binge, killing the German soldiers Herbert Neumann and Hermann Beckmann. He later claimed to have acted in rage over his wife's death. The Norwegian court system started working on Andersen's case, eventually reaching judge advocate Ivar Follestad. Andersen was defended by Reidar Skau, who was made Supreme Court Justice in 1945. Follestad deemed it necessary to prosecute Andersen, but wanted to pardon him after the verdict. After spending {{more than a year}} in the civilian and <b>military</b> <b>court</b> systems Andersen's murder case reached the top levels of the Royal Norwegian Navy, and on 5 August 1946 it was decided to take the case to the Gulating <b>Military</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal. Three months later Follestad made a decision of non-indictment, despite there being evidence to convict Andersen. In January 1947 the general jurisdiction chief, Thore Horve, also declared for a decision of non-indictment. Follestad and Horve were supported in this by Minister of Defence Jens Christian Hauge, and the decision was made final by royal resolution on 25 April 1947. This led to protests from, amongst others, leading Norwegian psychiatrist Johan Scharffenberg.|$|E

5|$|From 28 December 1945 to 4 January 1946, seven Wehrmacht {{servicemen}} {{were tried}} by a Soviet <b>military</b> <b>court</b> in Leningrad. One of them, Arno Düre, who {{was charged with}} murdering numerous civilians using machine-guns in Soviet villages, confessed to having taken part in burial (though not the execution) of 15,000 to 20,000 Polish POWs in Katyn. For this he was spared execution and was given 15 years of hard labor. His confession was full of absurdities, and thus he was not used as a Soviet prosecution witness during the Nuremberg trials. He later recanted his confession, claiming that {{he was forced to}} confess by the investigators.|$|E

5|$|In late 1939, he {{was accused}} by French {{military}} authorities of helping Palestinian rebels in the revolt, tried by a <b>military</b> <b>court,</b> and sentenced to five years imprisonment in the Citadel of Damascus.

He was released in November 1944. After his release, Darwaza was unable to return to Nablus because British authorities had issued an order preventing him from entering Palestine. As a result, he left for Turkey, mostly staying in Bursa until the end of 1945.|$|E
5|$|Kesselring's own {{trial began}} in Venice on 17 February 1947. The British <b>Military</b> <b>Court</b> was {{presided over by}} Major General Sir Edmund Hakewill-Smith, {{assisted}} by four lieutenant colonels. Colonel Richard C. Halse – who had already obtained {{the death penalty for}} von Mackensen and Kurt Mälzer – was the prosecutor. Kesselring's legal team was headed by Hans Laternser, a skilful German lawyer who specialised in Anglo-Saxon law, had represented several defendants at the Nuremberg Trials, and would later go on to represent Generalfeldmarschall Erich von Manstein. Kesselring's ability to pay his legal team was hampered because his assets had been frozen by the Allies, but his legal costs were eventually met by friends in South America and relatives in Franconia.|$|E

A <b>military</b> <b>court</b> martial was held, and 19 of the soldiers were hung, and 67 others were imprisoned. In spite of the Houston riot, Du Bois and others successfully pressed the Army to accept the officers trained at Spingarn's camp, resulting in over 600 black officers joining the Army in October 1917.|$|E
5|$|The march {{ended in}} a picket {{in front of the}} Banovina building, where the JNA had its {{headquarters}} in Split at the time. The protesters demanded an end to the JNA-imposed blockade of the village of Kijevo.

Four organisers of the protest were arrested a month later by the JNA, tried in a <b>military</b> <b>court</b> and convicted. They were released months later in a prisoner exchange. The protest caused the JNA to withdraw a portion of military equipment previously based in Split to more secure locations and increase its combat readiness there.
