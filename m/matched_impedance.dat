50|$|A {{balanced}} circuit is circuitry {{for use with}} a balanced line or the balanced line itself. Balanced lines are a common method of transmitting many types of electrical communication signals between two points on two wires. In a balanced line the two signal lines are of a <b>matched</b> <b>impedance</b> to help ensure that interference induced in the line is common-mode and can be removed at the receiving end by circuitry with good common-mode rejection. To maintain the balance, circuit blocks which interface to the line, or are connected in the line, must also be balanced.|$|E
50|$|Mismatch loss in {{transmission}} line theory {{is the amount}} of power expressed in decibels that will not be available on the output due to impedance mismatches and signal reflections. A {{transmission line}} that is properly terminated, that is, terminated with the same impedance as that of the characteristic impedance of the transmission line, will have no reflections and therefore no mismatch loss. Mismatch loss represents the amount of power wasted in the system. It can also be thought of as the amount of power gained if the system was perfectly <b>matched.</b> <b>Impedance</b> matching {{is an important part of}} RF system design; however, in practice there will likely be some degree of mismatch loss. In real systems, relatively little loss is due to mismatch loss and is often on the order of 1dB.|$|E

50|$|The {{bones in}} the middle ear provide <b>impedance</b> <b>matching</b> between the eardrum (which is acted upon by {{vibrations}} in air) and the fluid-filled inner ear. Horns are used like transformers, <b>matching</b> the <b>impedance</b> of the transducer to the impedance of the air. This principle is used in both horn loudspeakers and musical instruments. Most loudspeaker systems contain <b>impedance</b> <b>matching</b> mechanisms, especially for low frequencies. Because most driver impedances which are poorly <b>matched</b> to the <b>impedance</b> of free air at low frequencies (and because of out-of-phase cancellations between output from {{the front and rear}} of a speaker cone), loudspeaker enclosures both <b>match</b> <b>impedances</b> and prevent interference.

40|$|Certain {{applications}} such as RFID, on body sensors network, microwave systems usually require good <b>matching</b> <b>impedance,</b> high gain and large bandwidth for their antennas. The aperture coupled antenna is one candidate that can provide high gain large bandwidth and little packaging. Thus, it would {{be of interest to}} enhance the characteristics of a singly-fed aperture antenna used for Zigbee application. In this paper, we are presenting a new design of aperture coupled rectangular patch antenna operating at 2. 45 GHz ISM-band frequency. The objective of this design {{is not limited to the}} improvement of the impedance bandwidth but also to better the coupling involved. The cross-polarisation (X-pol), the backward radiation and the half-power beam width in two orthogonal planes are also examined. The proposed design is based on a new aperture coupling technique in which two slots are fed by a microstrip line and coupled to a parasitic patch radiator etched on the opposite side from the slots. The <b>matching</b> <b>impedance</b> for a conventional aperture coupled microstrip antenna is obtained by the adjustment of the dimension of the slot and the feeding line. Here, the distance separating the slots is employed to control the coupling and modifying the input impedance of the antenna.
