40|$|In closed conduit water systems, {{being able}} to {{accurately}} measure flow is absolutely essential. For many meter designs, including electromagnetic induction meters (also known as <b>magnetic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters),</b> the greatest accuracy is achieved when the device is calibrated correctly. Optimal meter accuracy often depends on the flow conditions associated with the upstream geometry in the pipe system. Manufacturers typically give standards {{for the length of}} straight pipe required upstream of the meter. These standards vary, however, and do not address every possible configuration that may be installed upstream of the straight pipe requirement. An investigation on the effects of the length of straight pipe between a single 90 ° elbow and the upstream side of <b>magnetic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> was completed in this research. Eleven 10 -inch meters were chosen for testing. The procedure included a baseline test with more than forty diameters of straight pipe between the elbow and the meter. The accuracy of the meter was determined over a range of flow velocities typical for operation of this type and size of meter. Further tests were performed with the meter installed only three diameters downstream of the elbow. These tests constitute Phase I. In Phase II, four meters were tested with the upstream pipe length varying from a close-coupled installation to ten diameters of straight pipe between the elbow and the meter to observe variances in accuracy with distance from the elbow. The intent of the research was to show whether manufacturer accuracy specifications are achievable in actual application. It was determined that very few meters meet the manufacturer’s specification for accuracy even when installation requirements were met. Post-factory calibrations and minimization of velocity profile disruption through consideration of upstream geometry is recommended...|$|R
5000|$|Magnetic flow meters, {{often called}} [...] "mag meter"s or [...] "electromag"s, use a {{magnetic}} field applied to the metering tube, which results in a potential difference proportional to the flow velocity perpendicular to the flux lines. The potential difference is sensed by electrodes aligned perpendicular to the flow and the applied magnetic field. The physical principle at work is Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> requires a conducting fluid and a nonconducting pipe liner. The electrodes must not corrode {{in contact with the}} process fluid; some magnetic flowmeters have auxiliary transducers installed to clean the electrodes in place. The applied magnetic field is pulsed, which allows the flowmeter to cancel out the effect of stray voltage in the piping system.|$|E

The project is also responsible for measuring tank waste slurry properties prior to injection into pipeline systems, including the Replacement of Cross-Site Transfer System. This report summarizes studies of {{the appropriateness of the}} instrumentation specified for use in Project W- 211. The instruments were evaluated in a test loop with simulated slurries that covered the range of properties specified in the functional design criteria. The results of the study indicate that the compact nature of the baseline Project W- 211 loop does not result in reduced instrumental accuracy resulting from poor flow profile development. Of the baseline instrumentation, the Micromotion densimeter, the Moore Industries thermocouple, the Fischer and Porter <b>magnetic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter,</b> and the Red Valve Pressure transducer meet the desired instrumental accuracy. An alternate <b>magnetic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> (Yokagawa) gave nearly identical results as the baseline fischer and Porter. The Micromotion flow meter did not meet the desired instrument accuracy but could potentially be calibrated so that it would meet the criteria. The Nametre on-line viscometer did not meet the desired instrumental accuracy and is not recommended as a quantitative instrument although it does provide qualitative information.

40|$|As {{the need}} to manage water {{resources}} increases, the ability to accurately measure use becomes crucial. In industry, measurement inaccuracies can cost either the supplier or consumer {{large amounts of money}} or even result in a depleted resource. Generally, flow meters need a flow profile to be fully developed to optimize measurement accuracy. In order to produce accurate measurements, most flow meters require a straight section of pipe immediately upstream of the meter. The straight pipe helps to develop the flow profile and produces flow conditions that are as ideal as possible. In many field installations, space restrictions lead to meters being installed with reduced straight pipe between a flow disturbance and the meter. Electromagnetic flow meters are referred to by several different names including: <b>magnetic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter,</b> mag meter or mag. The electromagnetic flow meter has grown in popularity in recent years as technology has improved and costs have decreased. Manufacturers commonly claim that their meters can produce highly accurate flow measurements, some as low as ± 0. 10 %, with reduced upstream straight pipe requirements as low as 0 pipe diameters between a disturbance and the meter itself. The results of this study provide quantified error associated with a partially closed butterfly valve on electromagnetic flow meter accuracy. The results show the effect of four valve openings (25 %, 50 %, 75 %, and 100 % open), at five locations downstream of the valve (1, 3, 5, 10, and 20 pipe diameters), and at two different meter orientations to the valve shaft. It was concluded in the study that twenty pipe diameters of length are required to produce accurate measurements (within the manufacturer’s specified accuracy) when a <b>magnetic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> is installed downstream of a throttling butterfly valve. Surprisingly, the largest effect to the meter’s accuracy unexpectedly occurred when the upstream butterfly valve was fully open and not when it was in a throttling position...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "mag meters", are technically a velocity-type water meter, except that they use electromagnetic properties to determine the water flow velocity, rather than the mechanical means used by jet and turbine meters. Mag meters use the physics principle of Faraday's law of induction for measurement, and require AC or DC electricity from a power line or battery to operate the electromagnets. Since mag meters have no mechanical measuring element, they normally have the advantage of being able to measure flow in either direction, and use electronics for measuring and totalizing the <b>flow.</b> Mag <b>meters</b> can also be useful for measuring raw (untreated/unfiltered) water and waste-water, since there is no mechanical measuring element to get clogged or damaged by debris <b>flowing</b> through the <b>meter.</b> Strainers are not required with mag meters, since there is no measuring element in the stream of flow that could be damaged. Since stray electrical energy flowing through the flow tube can cause inaccurate readings, most mag meters are installed with either grounding rings or grounding electrodes to divert stray electricity away from the electrodes used to measure the flow inside the flow tube.|$|R

50|$|Some designs {{require that}} only {{lubricating}} fluid be measured, because the rotors {{are exposed to}} the fluid. PD meters differ from turbine meters in that they handle medium and high-viscosity liquids well. For this reason, they are often used to measure the flow of hydraulic fluids. Compared with orifice-type meters, PD meters require very little straight upstream piping since they are not sensitive to uneven flow distribution across the area of the pipe. Positive displacement <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> can provide better relative accuracy at low flows than orifice-type <b>flow</b> <b>meters.</b> However, a positive displacement meter can be considerably heavier and more costly than non-positive-displacement types such as orifice plates, <b>magnetic</b> or vortex <b>flow</b> <b>meters.</b>|$|R

The preparation of sufficient quantities of selected protein groups for functionality studies and food application tests requires considerable amounts of starting material, particularly in the case of whey-based constituents. Adequate amounts of membrane filtration surface area are, therefore, needed in order to expedite processing time, limit conditions for microbial growth and increase productivity from a product development point of view. With this objective in mind, a series of large pilot plant membrane separation systems based on microfiltration, ultrafiltration and electrodialysis were recently installed and commissioned. Rapid ultrafiltration of whey for the generation of high protein concentrates under a wide variety of conditions, including 'cold' filtration, is facilitated by a MemtechTM spiral wound membrane plant with a maximum surface area of 144 m^ 2 that is accommodated within 3 modules mounted in parallel.

The meters tested included two 72 -inch <b>magnetic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> designated M 001 A and M 001 D, and two 60 -inch venturi meters, designated M 001 E and M 001 W.

Continuous monitoring of the effluent and withdrawal of discrete samples was done at the location of the metering tunnel discharge into the east primary influent channel. Meters M 001 E and M 001 W were tested using the dye dilution technique only. Throughout the testing process all dye dilution samples were analyzed separately using fluorometers operated by both SAFHL and the research and development staff at the MWCC.

The system is started up on water, then sanitized by circulating water at 98  °C for 20  min. After sanitization, the system is cooled down and controlled at the desired operating temperatures for the experiment. The system is equipped with: regenerator bypass on the raw regenerator to allow {{for control of the}} temperature out of the regenerator and cascade hot water to heater product out temperature control to control the feed temperature to the MST inlet. The product is then fed to the inlet nozzle or nozzles of the MST chamber at a controlled pressure (pressure =  800, 000  Pa). Milk droplets are sprayed into the unit, at which time the milk is then heated to temperature within 0.02  s, which establishes the desired effect. The internal temperature of the MST unit is controlled by the cascade temperature control of hot water to internal temperature. This temperature is controlled at a value 10  °C higher than the inlet temperature. The lower jacket is cooled to prevent further heat treatment of the droplets collecting {{on the bottom of the}} MST Chamber. The discharge pump from the MST chamber controls a minimum level in the discharge leg of the MST chamber, and acts as the motive force to push through the downstream pasteurized regenerator and cooling sections of the process, and finally discharged to the destination. The system is controlled for circulation of water, water to product change-over, product discharge, product to water change-over, and clean-in-place (CIP) cycles. The milk is then cooled to 4  °C and expelled from the processor.|$|R
40|$|Electromagnetic {{flowmeters}} (known as {{magnetic flow}} meters) are a widely used type of flowmeter. The accuracy of magnetic flow meters are {{a function of}} several factors, {{not the least of}} which is the flow condition inside the pipe. It has been shown that disturbances in the velocity profile affects the accuracy of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> (Luntta, 1998). Accordingly, manufacturers of magnetic flow meters give installation guidelines. These guidelines help prevent the user from installing the meter in a pipe configuration that is likely to cause the meter to produce inaccurate results. Although most manufacturers provide recommendations about the amount of straight pipe that is necessary upstream of the meter, little is said about the orientation of the meter in relation to upstream disturbances. This study examines the performance of magnetic flow meters when positioned at two different orientations: EIP (electrodes in plane with an upstream 90 -degree short radius elbow) and EOP (electrodes out of plane). Four different meters were included in the study in which a baseline straight pipe test was first performed using over fifty diameters of straight pipe upstream of each meter. The straight pipe test was used to determine the baseline accuracy of each of the meters over a velocity range that is typical for the size and function of the meters. Meters were then installed at five different locations downstream from a 90 -degree short-radius elbow. At each location the meters were tested in two orientations at five different flow rates. The intent of the research is to show that the orientation of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> affects the meter’s ability to produce accurate flow readings when it is installed downstream of a flow disturbance. The results from this research showed a significant shift in measurement accuracy when the meter was in EIP and EOP orientations. All of the meters in the study produced accuracy readings at one point of another that were outside the specified accuracy from the meter manufacturer. Interestingly, the meters that had a larger manufacturer specified accuracy produced smaller shifts in accuracy when comparing the test results under EIP and EOP conditions.

Methods/Statistical Analysis: The investigation was carried out experimentally at three pump speeds (2200 rpm, 2600 rpm, 300 rpm), for three clinker sizes (4 mm, 13 mm, 20 mm) and three slurry concentrations (5 %, 10 %, 15 %). The test loop was incorporated with pressure sensors and <b>magnetic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> and digital output devices. For comparison tests were also carried out with clear water. Findings: The investigations points out that pump speed, clinker size and slurry concentration grossly affect the performance of the pump.

The decrease in the maximum efficiency of the pump at the operating point was observed to be 58 % for clinker size of 20 mm with 5 % slurry concentration at the pump speed of 2200 rpm. The maximum decrement in efficiency at operating point for clinker was found to be 58 % for 20 mm size, 5 % concentration and at 2200 rpm.

40|$|Master of Technology: Civil Engineering In the Faculty of Engineering At the Cape Peninsula University of Technology 2014 Notches, {{particularly}} rectangular and V shaped are {{the cheapest}} and most common devices {{used to measure}} the flow rate of water in open channels. However, they have not been {{used to measure the}} flow rate of non-Newtonian fluids. These viscous fluids behave differently from water. It is difficult to predict the flow rate of such fluids during transportation in open channels due to their complex viscous properties. The aim of this work was to explore the possibility of extending the application of especially rectangular and V-shaped notches to non-Newtonian fluids. The tests reported in this document were carried out in the Flow Process and Rheology Centre laboratory. Notches fitted to the entrance of a 10 m flume and an in-line tube viscometer were calibrated using water. The in-line tube viscometer with 13 and 28 mm diameter tubes was used to determine the fluid rheology. Flow depth was determined using digital depth gauges and flow rate measurements using <b>magnetic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters.</b> Three different non-Newtonian fluids, namely, aqueous solutions of Carboxymethyl Cellulose (CMC) and water-based suspensions of kaolin and bentonite were used as model non-Newtonian test fluids. From these the coefficient of discharge (Cd) values and appropriate non-Newtonian Reynolds numbers for each fluid and concentration were calculated. The experimental values of the coefficient of discharge (Cd) were plotted against three different definitions of the Reynolds number. Under laminar flow conditions, the discharge coefficient exhibited a typical dependence on the Reynolds number with slopes of ~ 0. 43 - 0. 44 for rectangular and V notches respectively. The discharge coefficient was nearly constant in the turbulent flow regime. Single composite power-law functions were used to correlate the Cd-Re relationship for each of the two notch shapes used. Using these correlations, the Cd values could be predicted to within ± 5 % for the rectangular and V notches. This {{is the first time that}} such a prediction has been done for a range of non-Newtonian fluids through sharp crested notches.

It was intended to suggest performance criteria and performance improvement for the effective cooling system. Methods: The measuring instruments consisted of two flow meters, a power meter and thermocouples. An ultrasonic and a <b>magnetic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> measured the flow rate of the water, which was equivalent to heat transfer fluid. The power meter measured electric power in kW consumed by the heat pump system. T-type thermocouples measured the temperature of {{each part of the}} heat pump system. All of measuring instruments were connected to the recorder to store all the data. Results: When the water temperature supplied into the evaporator of the heat pump system was over 20 °C, the cooling Coefficient Of Performance(COP) of the system was higher than 3. 0. As the water temperature supplied into the evaporator, gradually, lowered, the cooling COP, also, decreased, linearly. Especially, when the water temperature supplied into the evaporator was lower than 15 °C, the cooling COP was lower below 2. 5. Conclusions: In order to maintain the cooling COP higher than 3. 0, we suggest that the water temperature supplied into evaporator from the thermal storage tank should be maintained above 20 °C. Also, stratification in the thermal storage tank should be formed well and the circulating pumps and the pipe lines should be arranged in order for the relativ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>magnetic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> {{is one of}} {{the best}} {{possible}} choice for the measurement of flow rate of liquid metals in fast breeder reactors. Due to the associated complexities in the measuring environment, theoretical evaluation of their sensitivity is always preferred. In order to consider the 3 D nature of the problem and the general flow patterns, numerical field computational approach is inevitable. When classical Galerkin's finite element formulation is employed for the solution, it is known to introduce numerical oscillations at high flow rates. The magnetic field produced by the flow induced currents circulate within the fluid and forms the source of this numerical problem. To overcome this, modified methods like stream-line upwind Petrov-Galerkin schemes are generally suggested in the allied areas like fluid dynamics, in which a similar dominance of advective (curl or circulation) component occurs over diffusion (divergence) component. After a careful analysis of the numerical instability through a reduced one dimensional problem, an elegant stable approach is devised. In this scheme, a pole-zero cancellation approach is adopted. The proposed scheme is shown to be absolutely stable. However, at lower flow rates numerical results exhibits small oscillation, which can be controlled by reducing the element size. The source of stability at higher flow rates, as well as, oscillations at lower flow rates are analysed using analytical solution of the associated difference equation. Finally the proposed approach is applied to the original flow meter problem and the solution is shown to be stable. Comment: IET Science, Measurement & Technology, 201...|$|E
40|$|Final {{design of}} the mast was {{completed}} (Task 5). The mast is consisting of two welded plate girders, set next to each other, and spaced 14 -inches apart. Fabrication of the boom will be completed in two parts solely for ease of transportation. The end pivot connection will be made through a single 2 -inch diameter x 4 feet- 8 inch long 316 SS bar. During installation, hard piping make-ups using Chiksan joints will connect the annular section and 4 -inch return line to allow full movement of the mast from horizontal to vertical. Additionally, flexible hoses and piping will be installed to isolate both towers from piping loads and allow recycling operations respectively. Calibration of the prototype Foam Generator Cell has been completed and experiments are now being conducted. We were able to generate up to 95 % quality foam. Work is currently underway to attach the Thermo-Haake RS 300 viscometer and install a view port with a microscope to measure foam bubble size and bubble size distribution. Foam rheology tests (Task 13) were carried out to evaluate the rheological properties of the proposed foam formulation. After successful completion of the first foam test, two sets of rheological tests were conducted at different foam flow rates while keeping other parameters constant (100 psig, 70 F, 80 % quality). The results from these tests are generally {{in agreement with the}} previous foam tests done previously during Task 9. However, an unanticipated observation during these tests was that in both cases, the frictional pressure drop in 2 inch pipe was lower than that in the 3 inch and 4 inch pipes. We also conducted the first foam cuttings transport test during this quarter. Experiments on aerated fluids without cuttings have been completed in ACTF (Task 10). Gas and liquid were injected at different flow rates. Two different sets of experiments were carried out, where the only difference was the temperature. Another set of tests was performed, which covered a wide range of pressure and temperature. Several parameters were measured during these tests including differential pressure and mixture density in the annulus. Flow patterns during the aerated fluids test have been observed through the view port in the annulus and recorded by a video camera. Most of the flow patterns were slug flow. Further increase in gas flow rate changed the wavy flow pattern to slug flow. At this stage, all of the planned cuttings transport tests have been completed. The results clearly show that temperature significantly affects the cuttings transport efficiency of aerated muds, in addition to the liquid flow rate and gas liquid ratio (GLR). Since the printed circuit board is functioning (Task 11) with acceptable noise level we were able to conduct several tests. We used the newly designed pipe test section to conduct tests. We tested to verify that we can distinguish between different depths of sand in a static bed of sand in the pipe section. The results indicated that we can distinguish between different sand levels.

40|$|A {{traditional}} {{sand filter}} {{for treatment of}} household wastewater was constructed {{in the fall of}} 2012 at Biolinja 12, Turku, Finland. Construction work was led and monitored by an authorized wastewater treatment consultant. The filter was placed on a field bordered by open ditches from all sides in order to collect excess rain and snowmelt waters. The filter was constructed and insulated from the environment so that all outflowing water was accounted for. Untreated, mainly municipal, wastewater from Varissuo suburb was pumped from a sewer separately via three septic tanks (volume = 1 m(3) each) into the filters. Normally, wastewater was distributed to ground filters automatically according to pre-programmed schedule. Initially, the daily flow was 1200 L day(- 1) to reflect the average organic load of a household of five persons (load: ca 237 g day(- 1) BOD; 73 g day(- 1) total N; and 10. 4 g day(- 1) total P). Later in the test, the flow rate was decreased first to 900 and then to 600 L day(- 1) to better reflect the average volume produced by five persons. Volumes of inlet wastewater as well as treated water were monitored by <b>magnetic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters.</b> Samples were withdrawn from the inlet water, from the water entering the filters after the third septic tank, and from the outflowing water. After an initial adaption time, the reductions in BOD and chemical oxygen demand were constantly between 92 and 98 %, showing that the biological degradation process in the filters functioned optimally and clearly comply with the national and EU standards. The reduction in total nitrogen and total phosphorus, however, reached required levels only during the first months of testing, apparently when buildup of microbial biomass was still ongoing. After this initial period of 3 months showing satisfactory reduction levels, the reduction of total nitrogen varied between 5 and 25 % and total phosphorus mostly between 50 and 65 %. Nitrification was efficient in the filter, but as indicated by high nitrate levels and poor nitrogen reductions, denitrification was inefficient or absent. During the winter period, the temperature in the filter dropped to near freezing, but at all time points, the flow of water was unaffected by freezing. During snowmelt and heavy rain, occasional flooding was observed. Such situations may lead to dilution rather than purification of the wastewater. In conclusion, the sand filter tested worked well for reduction of the organic load in municipal wastewater but failed to sufficiently reduce nitrogen and phosphorus levels...|$|R

40|$|Strong free-surface vortex flows {{are widely}} {{employed}} in various civil engineering and industrial applications. However, {{a review of}} the state-of-the-art suggests that a number of areas surrounding the underlying flow mechanics in these systems requires additional attention and are therefore explored in this study. The research focuses on experimental and numerical analysis as well as analytical investigations of the flow problem. Experimental modelling was performed in two phases: investigation into the effects of the approach flow geometry and an exploration of the mean three-dimensional velocity fields and secondary flow processes. Twelve geometries of a typical scroll type vortex chamber were constructed and independently tested in a customised hydraulic test rig. Model discharges were monitored using a <b>magnetic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> and the approach flow depths and water surface profiles were monitored using a depth gauge apparatus. The horizontal velocity field in the far- to mid-field was measured using a 2 D particle tracking velocimetry system. Particle streak velocimetry was employed to determine the near-field tangential and axial velocity fields. The results highlighted an explicit dependence of the circulation number NΓ and the discharge number NQ on the approach flow conditions. Two empirical auxiliary parameters 1 ̆d 4581 ̆d 6 fc and 1 ̆d 45 b 1 ̆d 6 fc were proposed and further modelled to yield an alternative depth-discharge equation. The model was validated using a scaled model and a prototype. Scale effects in the physical models were found to be negligible. The investigation of the primary flow field indicated that the tangential velocity field was independent of the sub-surface depth away from the tank boundaries. Using the available velocity data and laser-induced fluorescence images, the radial velocity was observed to be confined at the vessel floor and free-surface. The axial velocity appeared to be concentrated in a downward direction in the core region as well as in a newly observed upward direction at the tank periphery. Further analysis showed that the ideal irrotational tangential velocity model agrees with the experimental data in the far-field. However, large discrepancies were observed in the near-field close to the vortex core. Based on analytical and numerical analysis, it was proposed that the discrepancy was {{as a result of the}} axial velocity gradient in the core region which was not accounted for in the original assumptions of the model. As a result, an alternative tangential velocity profile was devised based on a correction multiplier containing the inverse of the circulation number and the empirical exponent 1 ̆d 45 a. The model relieves the discrepancy of the ideal model by reducing it in areas of strong axial flow to within reasonable levels. iii Three-dimensional numerical modelling of the strong free-surface vortex was performed using an Eulerian-Eulerian homogeneous multiphase flow model in the ANSYS CFX computational fluid dynamics code. The experimental data was used as a benchmark to compare the solutions of the numerical model for various test cases in a single model. The comparison showed that the maximum solution accuracy was obtained using a radially structured mesh and a solution independent mesh density was presented. The model was strongly dependent on the type of turbulence model used. Standard Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations appeared to be highly dissipative and overestimated the generation of turbulence in the core region which generated significant errors in the solution. The modified shear stress transport with curvature correction as well as the Reynolds stress models delivered the greatest model accuracy. It was also found that transient modelling was necessary to resolve the unsteady features of the flow field, namely that of free-surface oscillations and the radial flow field. However, the final comparison using the Reynold Stress models nonetheless rendered a significant error in under predicting the free-surface and over predicting the tangential velocity distribution by approximately 12 and 22...|$|E
40|$|Microfin tubes {{have already}} been widely used for {{air-conditioning}} and refrigeration applications as they ensure a large heat transfer enhancement with a relatively low pressure drop increase. During condensation microfin tubes show a heat transfer enhancement, compared to equivalent smooth tubes under the same operating conditions, that {{is partly due to}} the mere increase in the effective exchange area, and additionally to the turbulence induced in the liquid film by the micro fins and to the surface tension effect on the liquid drainage. The performances of these microfin tubes during condensation of refrigerants have been studied experimentally and theoretically. In this work the authors present their own data when condensing R- 134 a inside two different tubes: a 9. 5 mm outer diameter microfin tube (7. 69 mm inside diameter at the fin tip and 60 fins with 0. 23 mm fin height and 13 ° helix angle) and a plain 8 mm inner diameter tube. Many authors use the so-called Wilson-plot method to measure the heat transfer coefficient of tubes; here, the experimental data have been taken by direct measurement of the wall temperature {{in a wide range of}} operative conditions: mass velocities ranging from 100 to 800 kg/(m 2 s) and vapour quality from 20 to 80 %; saturation temperature was kept constant at 40 °C. The experimental tests were run in a new test section set up at the Dipartimento di Fisica Tecnica of the University of Padova. The test section is a counter flow tube-in-tube condenser, with the refrigerant condensing in the inner tube, against the cold water flowing in the annulus. The measuring sections are 300 mm long and they are instrumented with thermocouples embedded in the tube wall, in the middle of the tube for the microfin tube and at inlet and outlet for the smooth tube. The thermocouples are soldered along the circumference to draw a cross shape. Refrigerant temperatures at inlet and outlet of the test section are measured by means of adiabatic sections, using thermocouples inserted into both the refrigerant flow and the tube wall. The refrigerant flow can be independently controlled by a variable speed gear pump. Two digital strain gauge pressure (absolute and differential) transducers are connected to manometric taps to measure the refrigerant pressure upstream and downstream of the test tube. The refrigerant mass flow rate is measured by a Coriolis effect mass flow meter inserted downstream of the pump. The cooling water flow rate is measured by a <b>magnetic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> and its temperature gain across the instrumented test tube is measured with a copper-constantan thermopile, installed into mixing chambers to assure perfect mixing of the water. There is agreement in the literature that the mechanisms of heat transfer and pressure drop are intimately linked with the prevailing two-phase flow regime. During condensation inside horizontal tubes, the two-phase flow may be dominated by vapour shear or gravity forces. While annular flow pattern is associated with high vapour shear, stratified, wavy and slug flows appear when gravity is the controlling force. In a fully developed annular flow pattern, there is a thin condensate film on the entire tube wall, while the gas phase flows in the central core, and heat transfer is governed by vapour shear and turbulence. Very poor evidence about the effect of microfins on the flow patterns during condensation is given in the open literature. Thus, to investigate the two phase flow pattern during condensation a new test section was built up; it consists of a large brass chamber equipped with three glass windows expressly designed to light and to observe the fluid. The test tube ends up in the chamber, in this way the fluid outlet pattern can be analyzed and recorded with a high shutter digital video camera. The same operative conditions set for heat transfer coefficient measurements are reproduced in the visualization section in order to investigate the specific flow pattern at the outlet vapour quality. For the study of the main flow patterns, in particular focusing on the stratified/annular mode transition, the visualization experimental data are analysed with reference to parameters like dimensionless vapour velocity, Martinelli parameter and void fraction, that are adopted in the main available flow pattern maps. The aim of this work is to link the heat transfer coefficients and in particular the heat transfer enhancement of the microfin tube with the flow pattern during the process. Microfin tube shows different heat transfer enhancement with different mass velocities. Since the available maps are designed only for smooth tubes, the results of this experimental work could be used as a starting point for drawing a new flow pattern map specifically dedicated to enhanced tubes...|$|E

Crossflow {{microfiltration}} is a {{very effective}} and energy efficient separation method allowing separation of very fine particles from liquids. It is mainly used for separation of particles from 0. 1 to 10 microns. These membrane processes are used for separation of solids from liquids in pharmaceutical, chemical, food, and dairy industries {{as well as in}} environmental protection and water treatment (Fadaei et al. 2007, Chellam et al. 2011). Ceramic membranes are often used for treatment of water. These membranes are preferred for their higher chemical, mechanical, and thermal resistance compared with organic membranes. Membranes form a physical barrier to the sludge, bacteria and suspended particles. Microstructural parameters as pore size, pore density, and porosity of the membrane have a great influence on the permeate f lux (Ogunbiyi et al. 2008, Altunkaynak et al. 2010). Zeolites occur in a number of variations such as clinoptilolite and chabazite. Clinoptilolite is the most abundant zeolite and is easily available in more than 40 varieties. Natural and also synthetic zeolites have unique physical, chemical and structural properties. Therefore zeolites are widely used in technological, environmental and agricultural processes. One of the most studied zeolites, clinoptilolite showed the highest selectivity for some heavy metals ions such as Pb 2 +, Cd 2 +, Zn 2 + and Cu+ Babel et al. 2003). In the experiments natural zeolite was used from Nižný Hrabovec in the Slovak Republic. The structure is composed from three-dimensional grid, the main mineral is clinoptilolite. Clinoptilolite is composed of a tetrahedron (SiO 4) 4 - connected by oxygen atoms, and a part of the silicon atoms is replaced with aluminum atoms. The total volume of the cavities of the zeolite is from 24 to 32 %. The volume density is from 1600 to 1800 kg∙m- 3, the density from 2200 to 2440 kg∙m - 3 and the specific surface is from 30 to 60 m 2 ∙g - 1 (www. zeocem. com). For the experimental measurements special laboratory microfiltration apparatus was used. The filtered suspension was pumped using a membrane pump from a reservoir (4 liters volume) into membrane module, in which the ceramic membrane with porosity of 50 nm is placed. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> measured the flow of the suspension. The values of the input and output transmembrane pressure were recorded from gauges. From the membrane module permeate flowed to collecting bottle. The collecting bottle was placed on a labbalance. The monitored data (pressure, suspension flow rate, permeate flow and temperature) were processed by a computer program. The temperature of the suspension was maintained at 25 °C, the pressures were in the range from 40 to 100 kPa and the flow rate of the suspension was 2. 2 m∙s- 1. The measurements were focused on determination of the stability of the microfiltration system using different pressures and different concentrations of suspensions of zeolite. Experiments were performed to determine the permeate fluxin the microfiltration of suspensions of zeolite at concentration of 3 g∙L- 1, 6 g∙L- 1 and 9 g∙L - 1, at a constant pressure of 100 kPa and a constant rate of suspension flow of 2. 2 m∙s- 1. After stabilization of the system, and after the addition of a given concentration of zeolite to the apparatus in all three cases it is possible to see a decrease in membrane flux to a value of about 310 L∙m- 2 ∙h- 1. However this flux has not remained constant, but {{in the course of the}} experiment continued to decrease to a final value of 280 L∙m- 2 h- 1. This decrease indicates that under these conditions there is some fouling of the membrane at relatively low concentrations of the zeolite suspension. Due to membrane fouling experiments with gradual increasing and then decreasing of pressures were performed. In the experiments at a constant suspension f low rate of 2. 2 m∙s- 1 and a constant concentration of zeolite suspension of 3 g∙L- 1 the pressure in the apparatus was gradually varied from 40 to 70 kPa and then back to 60 kPa and 50 kPa. For each of these pressures the system was allowed to stabilize for 30 min. From the comparison of the levels of flow rates at 60 kPa and 50 kPa it may be seen that in both cases a decrease in flux occurs after reduction of pressure. Therefore, it can be concluded that in the microfiltration experiments with the membrane and zeolite used it is preferably to use lower operating pressure of 70 kPa. In the following experiments therefore the pressure of 50 kPa was used. These experiments were carried out at constant pressure and constant rate of 2. 2 m∙s- 1. Concentrations of zeolite were varied by 1 g∙L- 1 to a final concentration of 30 g∙L- 1. The system was stable at low concentrations of zeolites and there was no initial decrease of flow. In the experiments with higher zeolite concentrations has also been shown that even at the highest concentration of used zeolite suspension of 30 g∙L- 1 there was no decrease in membrane flux. This flux was approx. 150 L∙m- 2 ∙h- 1 and further did not decrease. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej. KEYWORDS: crossflow, separation,	liquid...|$|E
