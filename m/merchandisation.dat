40|$|Indian medical {{education}} system has seen {{rapid growth in}} the last two decades. Private medical colleges now account {{for more than half of}} the 270 medical colleges in 2009. This unregulated unequal growth brings two issues to focus: the failing quality of {{medical education}} and implementing effective solutions to address an artificial faculty shortage due to faculty mal-distribution. The menace posed by the unfettered <b>merchandisation</b> of medical education has to be controlled and efforts should be made by the Government to ensure maintenance of standards and check the unplanned growth of substandard medical colleges and substandard education norms in universities or their constituent medical colleges. Since Indian Independence, MCI nor the University Grants Commission nor the constituent universities including the health sciences universities have never attempted to grade medical colleges as per their quality standards hence in the absence of health education quality standards, the student output from recent, hurriedly established recent science institutions is definitely substandard. There is a strong case for a review of the entire system of medical education and examinations in the country. Some solutions like increasing retirement ages of MD faculty to 70 years, sharing of faculty, increasing the total number of MD seats, allowing standard institutions like IIT’s to take over substandard colleges, allowing clinical MDs to teach para-clinical and pre-clinical subjects or temporary merger of specialties may address the widely publicized faculty shortage instead of relying on inadequately qualified MSc. nonmedical faculty...|$|E
40|$|Professeur de littérature américaine à l’Université du Maine (Le Mans). Hélène Aji is Professor of American and Modernist Literature at the Université du Maine (France). In {{addition}} {{to a number of}} articles on Modernist and contemporary American poetry, {{she is the author of}} Ezra Pound et William Carlos Williams: pour une poétique américaine (L’Harmattan, 2001), William Carlos Williams : un plan d’action (Belin, 2004), and a book-length essay on Ford Madox Ford’s The Good Soldier (Armand Colin, 2005). Recently, she was co-editor of L’impersonnel en littérature (Presses Universitaires de Rennes, 2008) and, with Helen M. Dennis, of an issue of the European Journal of English Studies on “Reading the Modernist Past”. Tony Lopez’s poetry is to be inscribed within the context of Postmodernist interrogations as they were shaping up in the late 1990 s around the notions of <b>merchandisation,</b> consumerism, the lessening power and meaningfulness of the signified through the intense circulation of signifiers. Yet it struggles against rather than adheres to the processes of fragmentation and reifying of both objects and signs. Lopez delves into the real so as to highlight and question the strictures of commodity culture’s underlying order. Aesthetic preoccupations are allied to the search for lost ethics and the renewal of ideological discourse. This discourse contradicts the overwhelming rhetoric of the cynical trend of Postmodernism. This article defines Tony Lopez’s work at the turn of the millennium as enforcing a poetics beyond the empty gestures of pastiche and poetical karaoke, tensely negotiating the demands of survival in the consumer society and the quest to impart some meaning to this, our, world...|$|E
