40|$|The {{circumscription}} {{and compromise}} theory of vocational aspirations {{draws attention to}} the possibility that many adolescents may unnecessarily limit their vocational options. This article describes key elements of the theory, particularly its emphasis on children’s perceptions of occupational sextype, and the changes the theory requires in how to conceptualize and assess vocational aspirations. It also describes a theory based Mapping Vocational Challenges 1 (MVC; Lapan, Loehr-Lapan, & Tupper, 1995) activity that helps adolescents map and discuss the beliefs and background factors that can lead them to rule out careers they might actually find interesting and perform well. Perceptions of, and preferences for, gender roles are central to the circumscription and compromise theory of occupational aspirations. The theory postulates that gender is (a) the first element of self-concept against which children judge the desirability of different occupations for people like themselves and (b) the aspect of self that young people are generally least willing to violate when they have to make major compromises in their vocational choices (Gottfredson, 1981, 1996). The theory therefore treats gender self-concept as one among other key individual differences (e. g., Holland, 1997, category of interests, intelligence) that shape young people’s vocational aspirations. Indeed, the theory attributes special salience to gender self-concept in explaining those IThe MVC activities are copyrighted <b>material.</b> <b>Additional</b> <b>information</b> on these activities as well as permission to use them can be obtained from Dr. Richard Lapan, 1...|$|E
40|$|Presented at The Oregon Water Conference, May 24 - 25, 2011, Corvallis, OR. Conventional {{monitoring}} {{to assess}} water quality {{of drinking water}} sources in streams and rivers is typically focused on identifying primary sources and conditions {{that are associated with}} mobilization of contaminants. This approach is often organized as a series of discrete samples collected {{in such a way as}} to capture the influence of specific land use activities or climatic events. Often streamflow data are included to facilitate calculation of loads, which allows the relative contribution from different sources and events to be compared. This approach is limited by the episodic nature of contaminant transport, so that integrating the health risk presented by observed concentrations is challenging with the limited data that are usually available. This limitation is especially pronounced because it does not account for synergistic effects among individual compounds. Other critical limitations include cost, considering the large number of compounds that may be relevant, and the analytical challenge of quantifying the very low concentrations that are typically present. An alternative approach is provided by the use of passive sampling techniques that specifically address the detection level challenge by concentrating contaminants into sorbent material over a long period of deployment, generally on the order of 30 days. These samplers provide an integrated view of contaminant exposure over time, and can better detect trace amounts of chemicals because of the increased mass of <b>material.</b> <b>Additional</b> <b>information</b> on the synergistic effects of chemicals on biota is provided by analysis of metabolic assays, such as the yeast estrogen screen bioassay. A combination of these three approaches in monitoring for drinking water source protection provides a more system-level perspective on transport and behavior of contaminants. This combined approach facilitates more complex understanding of contaminant occurrence and behavior than the simple monitoring of individual chemicals during targeted conditions, without sacrificing that more specific and detailed view. These three alternative modes of sampling are being used to evaluate risks to drinking-water quality in the McKenzie River. Early results demonstrate that the data complement each other and provide different insights. This approach is proposed as a useful foundation for monitoring a range of systems in Oregon that could provide a valuable opportunity for cost-effective collaboration by a number of drinking water providers...|$|E
40|$|The Procellarum KREEP Terrane {{displays}} the highest concentrations of Th on the Moon. However, locations of elevated Th {{in this region}} appear to be random. As observed in the 5 deg per pixel equal-area Th data, and made more evident in the preliminary 2 deg data, Th is enhanced around the craters Aristillus, Aristarchus, Kepler, Mairan, the Apennine Bench formation, and the Fra Mauro region, while noticeably and unexpectedly lower in other locations (e. g., Archimedes, Copernicus, Eratosthenes, and Plato). We have examined {{the composition of the}} materials present in these regions with the goal of understanding the patchy nature to the distribution of Th and ultimately to decipher the geologic processes that have concentrated the Th. At present time, the published resolution of the Lunar Prospector Th gamma-ray data is low (5 deg per pixel), but this will soon be superceded by significantly higher-resolution data (2 deg per pixel). Even at this improved resolution, however, it is difficult to resolve the units that are the major source of Th. In an attempt to circumvent this problem, we employ the higher-resolution Clementine multispectral data for those regions mentioned above. We use the UV-VIS-derived compositional information and the spectral properties of craters, and their ejecta as drill holes through the mare-basalt surface to investigate the thickness and composition of underlying material. With this information we attempt to piece together the stratigraphy and geologic history of the Imbrium-Procellanim region. We processed the five-band multispectral data from the Clementine Mission (415, 750, 900, 950, and 1000 nm) using ISIS software and calibration parameters developed by the USGS, Flagstaff, Arizona. Final image mosaics are in equal-area sinusoidal projection, and have a resolution of 250 m/pixel. Using the method of we produced maps of FeO and Ti 02 composition. Here we examine the Th, FeO, and Ti 02 composition and spectral properties of the craters discussed above and their ejecta, with the goal of describing the materials they excavate. One interpretation for the origin of the high-Th material is that subsurface KREEPy materials have been excavated by impact craters. The material excavated may be either volcanic KREEP (e,g., Apennine Bench Formation), KREEPy impact-melt breccia formed by the Imbrium impact (e. g., Fra Mauro Formation), or other KREEP-rich crustal material. Determining which type of material is responsible for the elevated Th and its extent is important to understanding the premare and possibly the prebasin stratigraphy of the Imbrium-Procellarum Region. Merging the 5 deg. Th data with the shaded relief map, we observe that the highest Th concentrations are not related to pre-Imbrium upper crustal materials. The Apennines, Alpes, and Caucasus Mountains represent the pre-Imbrian highlands material and do not express concentrations of Th, FeO, and TiO 2 as high as the most Th-fich materials exposed within the Procellarum KREEP Terrane. We observe that, in general, these massifs contain 10 - 14 wt% FeO and 4 - 7 ppm Th. Determining whether the Th signal is from KREEP basalts or KREEPy impact-melt breccias cannot be done with the Clementine data because the two rock types are compositionally and mineralogically too similar (e. g., the Th-rich, mafic impact-melt breccias in the Apollo sample collection are dominated by a KREEP-basalt like component. Mapping-the distribution and sizes of craters and whether they display elevated Th concentrations or not, should reveal the depth and thickness of the KREEP-rich materials, and whether they are ubiquitous (i. e., impact-melt breccia) or more randomly distributed; this might be taken as an indicator of localized KREEP-basalt flows. Within the southeastern region of the Imbrium basin, there are two Th hot spots. The first is associated with the crater Aristillus, and the latter with the Apennine Bench Formation. Adjacent to these two hot spots are craters with a lower Th signature: Archimedes and Autolycus. We observe in the ejecta of Aristillus, a region of significantly lower FeO (10 - 14 wt%) relative to the surrounding mare basalt. The crater Autolycus, 50 km to the south, did not excavate similar low-FeO material. We suggest that the lower-FeO material in the ejecta of Aristillus corresponds to Th-rich material; the FeO content observed in Aristillus ejecta is comparable to that of KREEP basalt or mafic impact melt breccia (10 - 12 wt% FeO). We determine that this low FeO, Th-rich material is volcanic KREEP, as opposed to Imbrium impact melt, on the basis that the low-Fe material is exposed more prominently in ejecta in the northern portion of Aristillus. Our assumption is that if the layer underlying Aristillus was continuous, a more widespread and uniform low-Fe signature wouldbe observed in the ejecta deposit. Archimedes, 110 km southwest of Aristillus, impacted the northern portion of the Apennine Bench prior to the eruption of KREEP basalt. Archimedes rim material is not as enriched in Th as the Apennine Bench, and there are differences between the two in FeO concentration and in their continuum slope. Archimedes exhibits a much steeperor "redder" continuum slope than the Apennine Bench. This steepslope suggests the presence of glassy material. The glassy material is concentrated around an unnamed crater on the southern rim of Archimedes (4. 5 W, 28. 2 N) and along the northern rim of Archimedes. We suggest two possibilities, or a combination of the two, to explain the low-Th signal from Archimedes: (1) The Apennine Bench prior to KREEP basalt eruption was lower in Th (4 - 7 ppm, e. g., similar to the Apennine massifs) and KREEP basalts are absent in the rim of Archimedes; or (2) the glassy (possibly pyroclastic) material layering the rim of the Archimedes, dilutes any high-Th material present with low-Th <b>material.</b> (<b>Additional</b> <b>information</b> is contained in the original...|$|E
