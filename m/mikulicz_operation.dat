40|$|A {{retrospective}} study was carried on 66 patients surgically treated for perforated diverticular colonic disease: 22 had acute phlegmon or pericolic abscess and underwent primary resection and anastomosis. Of the remaining 44 patients, who had multiple pericolic and/or pelvic abscesses, or generalized peritonitis, in 30 cases the Hartmann procedure was used, 6 underwent <b>Mikulicz</b> <b>operation,</b> while drainage with proximal colostomy {{was performed in}} 5 cases, and simple suture and drainage in the last 3 cases. Operative mortality was 18. 2 %. Mortality rate was higher in patients treated by colostomy and drainage. The Hartmann procedure and resection-anastomosis patients had a mortality rate of 23. 3 % and 4. 4 % respectively. No mortality was registered among patients treated with suture and drainage...|$|E

40|$|The {{management}} of complicated diverticular {{disease of the}} colon is still not well clear. During the last decade were observed 422 patients with various degree of diverticular disease of the colon, {{all of whom were}} symptomatic. 51 patients underwent surgery : 29 for stenosis or oclusion (24 e 5), 4 for fistulas, 18 for perforation.

The incidence of complications was 17, 6 % 9 cases, 7 following emergency surgery and 2 after elective procedures). The intraoperative mortality was zero, while postoperatively it was 5, 8 % (3 cases, 2 after emergency procedures and 1 following elective surgery). The best results (lowest morbility and mortality rates) occurred with the radical procedures, especially the resection-anastomosis with or without colostomy, which allowed the removal of the septic focus from the peritoneal cavity and thus a rapid recovery in a high number of cases...|$|R
50|$|On 6 April 1904 Sauerbruch and Prof. <b>Mikulicz</b> {{presented}} an <b>operation</b> {{on the open}} thorax in a vacuum chamber, growing famous after succeeding, although the first patient, an old woman soon died. Nevertheless the second operation, performed on an opera singer, proved Sauerbruch's methods viable.|$|R
