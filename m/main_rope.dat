50|$|The {{failure was}} {{investigated}} by the National Park Service with assistance from Chris Harmston, Quality Assurance Manager at Black Diamond Equipment. Harmston concluded that a change in jump site angle probably caused the <b>main</b> jump <b>rope,</b> which consisted of several ropes tied together, to cross and catch on itself at a knot during his fall. This caused the rope to cut itself by melting. Harmston also noted that Osman's rope was in excellent condition, despite it having been left outdoors for some time.|$|R

50|$|Single, double, and twin rope are {{the three}} <b>main</b> <b>rope</b> systems used in ice climbing. The single rope system, which is suited for {{straight}} climbing routes, is {{the most commonly used}} rock climbing system in the world.

Lastly, the twin rope system, which uses two twin ropes in a single rope system, is used for longer multi-pitch routes. Double and twin rope technique is used more frequently in ice climbing because these systems are more redundant, an important consideration given the number of sharp edges the ice climber carries with him. Impact force on ice is an issue, with double ropes gaining popularity over twins.|$|E

There are also tri-cable gondolas that have two stationary cables that support the cabins. They differ from cable cars in that the latter consist only of one or two usually larger cabins, moving up and down, not circulating. Bi and tri cable systems provide greater lateral stability allowing the system to operate in higher cross-winds.|$|R

50|$|In Europe, pitches {{are often}} more complex, and multi-pitch rigging is used extensively. Long drops are broken into smaller pitches. Re-belays and {{deviations}} are used to direct the rope away from areas of sharp rock and from water. Where rope rub cannot be avoided, rope protectors are installed. Traverses are often installed to allow the rigger to reach an area where {{it is possible to}} hang the rope with no rub. Since allowing the rope to rub against the walls is prevented, lighter ropes are used, usually 8-9mm thick. This has the advantage of being lighter and therefore more economical to carry on long or deep trips. Bobbin descenders are quicker to change over at re-belays and are also lighter to carry. Deviations are short length of tape or rope pulling the <b>main</b> <b>rope</b> to one side with a carabiner which can be conveniently unclipped and replaced to allow passing. Rope-walking techniques are less effective in cases of awkward passageways and for changeovers at rebelays.Many caves have been equipped with bolt holes consisting of internally threaded metal inserts fixed into holes drilled in the rock. Subsequent visitors carry their own belay eyelets to bolt into these points. Selecting the best position for bolts needs particular care, the aim often being to achieve a 'Y' shaped rope hang between two bolts on opposite walls. This technique can help to prevent the rope from coming in contact with the rock, shares the load between the two belays, and reduces the shock load should one fail (in comparison {{with the use of a}} slack backup rope).|$|E

Foi utilizada estrutura do tipo long-line com corda {{principal}} medindo 25 m e 10 cordas secundÃrias de 2, 5 m instalaÃÃo a 200 m da costa com profundidade entre 5 e 6 m (marÃ seca). Foram fixadas 12 mudas por corda secundÃria com espaÃamento de 20 cm compondo 12 linhas de profundidade. Com 30 dias realizou-se a pesagem de todas as mudas da estrutura identificadas por corda secundÃria e linha de profundidade. Com 60 e 90 dias a pesagem foi apenas nas linhas de profundidade que apresentavam mudas em melhores condiÃÃes fÃsicas. Nas profundidades testadas de 0, 2 a 2, 4 m, observou-se um melhor desempenho do crescimento como tambÃm melhor aparÃncia e condiÃÃo fÃsica das mudas fixadas de 0, 2 a 1, 2 m, enquanto as fixadas entre 1, 4 a 1, 8 m ou tiveram crescimento inferior ou praticamente nÃo cresceram, e as fixadas no limite inferior entre 2, 0 e 2, 4 m verificou-se atrofiamento das mudas. Os pesos mÃdios obtidos apresentaram diferenÃa estatÃstica significativa (F = 187, 104; p = 0, 05). A TCE demonstrou correlaÃÃo negativa com a profundidade (r = - 0, 95; p = 0, 05; n = 120). Nas profundidades mais prÃximas da superfÃcie de 0, 2 a 0, 6 m favoreceram o crescimento das algas alcanÃando pesos de 167, 5 a 147, 0 g e TCE de 2, 92 e 2, 69 % dia- 1, entre 0, 8 a 1, 2 m pesos de 139, 0 a 124, 0 g e TCE de 2, 29 a 1, 90 % dia- 1, e a partir de 1, 4 m atÃ 2, 4 m pesos de 94, 5 a 59, 5 g e TCE de 0, 9 a 0, 53 % dia- 1. A reduÃÃo nos pesos abaixo de 1, 2 m foi bastante acentuada evidenciando que as algas tiveram detrimento em seu crescimento com a reduÃÃo da intensidade luminosidade apresentando atrofiamento de algumas mudas fixadas nas extremidades das cordas.

As one of the <b>main</b> users of <b>ropes</b> for permanent mooring systems, {{the oil and gas industry}} has opted for these components because they possess performance characteristics and economies of scale which are in many respects superior to steel components. Given this accrued experience, it is unsurprising that several marine renewable energy (MRE) device developers have utilised synthetic ropes, motivated by the need to specify economical, reliable and durable mooring systems. Whilst these components are potentially an enabling technology for the MRE sector, this is a new field of application which can feature highly dynamic mooring tensions and consequently existing certification practices may not be directly applicable. Based on the expertise of the authors, this paper provides a state-of-the-art overview of synthetic ropes in the context of MRE mooring systems, including key information about aspects of specification (performance attributes, classification and testing) as well as application (installation, degradation, maintenance, inspection and decommissioning).

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years coronagraphic and spectroscopic {{observations}} have demonstrated that small-scale eruptions, such as "jets," "narrow coronal mass ejections (CMEs)," "mini CMEs," "streamer puffs," "streamer detachments," and others, occur ubiquitously on the Sun. Nevertheless, the origin of small-scale eruptive events and how these are interrelated with larger scale CMEs have been poorly investigated so far. In this work, we study a series of small-scale side eruptions that occurred during and after a large-scale CME. Observations show that a CME can be associated not only with a single reconnection process, leading to the large-scale phenomenon, but also with many other side reconnections occurring at different locations and times around the <b>main</b> flux <b>rope,</b> possibly induced by the CME expansion in the surrounding corona. White light and EUV observations of a slow CME acquired by the SOHO/LASCO and SOHO/UVCS instruments are analyzed here to characterize the locations of side reconnections induced by the CME. The magnetic reconnection rate M has been estimated from the UVCS data from the ratio between the inflows and outflows observed around the reconnection region, and from the LASCO data from the observed aperture angles between the slow mode shocks (SMSs) associated with the reconnection. It turns out that M 0. 05 at the heliocentric distance of 1. 8 R, while between ~ 2. 5 and 5. 5 R, M values progressively decrease with time/altitude from M ~ 1 down to M ~ 0. 3. Such large values of M are theoretically acceptable only if flux pile-up reconnection is envisaged. The observed occurrence of multiple reconnections associated with a CME is verified by numerical simulations of an eruption occurring within multiple helmet streamers. The simulations confirm that small side reconnections are a consequence of CME expansion against the surrounding coronal streamers. The simulated and observed evolution of aperture angles between the SMSs are in good agreement as well. These results demonstrate the effect of the global coronal magnetic field in the occurrence of small-scale eruptions due to lateral reconnection in a preceding CME event. status: publishe...|$|R
