5|$|The Penokean Mountain Range {{formed in}} the Penokean orogeny 1880 to 1830 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> ago, when an oceanic island arc called the Pembine–Wausau terrane {{collided}} with the southern margin of the Superior craton. From 1880 to 1850 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> ago, the region was volcanically active. This volcanism ceased 1850 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> ago when a fragment of Archean crust arrived from the South at the subduction zone. Collision of this Archean crust in the south with the Superior craton in the North caused a period of intense crustal shortening. Rocks of the Pembine–Wassau terrane were thrust up over and onto the Superior craton, forming a mountain range that covered all but the northernmost portion of Lake Superior, crossed parts of three US states (south-central Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan), and continued to the southernmost tip of Ontario, Canada. Loading of the lithosphere by these thrust sheets caused it to flex downwards, forming a foreland basin at around 1850 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> ago {{in the south and}} 1835 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> ago in the north. The Rove Formation was deposited in the northern basin. In the southern basin, crustal thickening caused high-grade metamorphism of the sedimentary fill by 1830 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> ago. A series of post-orogenic plutons intruded into the overlying rocks 1830 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> ago,; these plutons mark the end of the Penokean orogeny.|$|E
5|$|The first eruptions of Nevado del Ruiz {{occurred}} about 1.8 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> ago at {{the beginning}} of the Pleistocene epoch. Three primary eruption periods in the history of the massif have been identified: ancestral, older and present. During the ancestral period between one million to two <b>million</b> <b>years</b> ago, a complex of large stratovolcanoes was created. Between 1.0 million and 0.8 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> ago, they partially collapsed, forming large (5–10km wide) calderas. During the older period, which lasted from 0.8 million to 0.2 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> ago, a new complex of large stratovolcanoes developed (including Older Ruiz, Tolima, Quindio, and Santa Isabel).

40|$|A 20 <b>million</b> <b>year</b> marine Ca isotope {{record is}} {{constructed}} based on measurements of 36 nannofossil ooze samples from DSDP Site 590. The Ca isotopic composition (delta 44 Ca, relative to our "bulk Earth" average) of carbonate ooze samples varies between - 0. 2 and - 0. 9, and the inferred delta 44 Ca of seawater calcium varies between + 1. 1 and + 0. 4 (modern seawater value is + 0. 95 on our scale). Fluctuations in the seawater Ca isotope ratio occur in 2 to 4 <b>million</b> <b>year</b> intervals and {{indicate that the}} supply and removal of Ca from the oceans are seldom in balance. The Ca isotope record is used to reconstruct past weathering fluxes and marine calcium concentrations.
