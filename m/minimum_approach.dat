40|$|Separation {{of animals}} and humans using a {{protective}} set-back distance (Minimum Ap-proaching Distance) is a popular tool for conservation managers to promote wildlife-hu-man coexistence. In several cases, <b>Minimum</b> <b>Approaching</b> Distance is based on how ani-mals respond to an approaching human, using Flight Initiation Distance or Alert Distance. Alert Distance, when animals first show increased vigilance to an approaching human, is considered the best basis for <b>Minimum</b> <b>Approaching</b> Distance because animals have time to adapt their response. Alert Distance is frequently difficult or impossible to measure in practice, however, especially in breeding birds. Using a study of breeding Wood Sandpip-ers Tringa glareola, in which Alert Distance could not be measured directly, we tested three possible solutions to this dilemma. Alarm Call Distance {{did not appear to}} provide a useful substitute for Alert Distance because sandpipers probably alarm called after they had first detected a human. Published predictions of Alert Distance using body mass also failed to provide realistic estimates of disturbance distances in Wood Sandpipers. The “fixed-slope rule”, which predicts that Alert Distance is about double Flight Initiation Distance, was not supported by relationships between Alarm Call Distance and Flight Ini-tiation Distance, but was supported by a relationship between an estimated Alert Distance surrogate and Flight Initiation Distance. This suggests that this rule may have general util-ity in predicting Alert Distance when only the more readily measured Flight Initiation Distance metric is known. AMinimum Approaching Distance (protective buffer zone) of 160 m is recommended for breeding Wood Sandpipers. 1...|$|R

40|$|In binary {{classification}} problems, mainly {{two approaches}} have been proposed; one is loss function approach {{and the other}} is <b>minimum</b> distance <b>approach.</b> The loss function approach is applied to major learning algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM) and boosting methods. The loss function represents the penalty of the decision function on the training samples. In the learning algorithm, the empirical mean of the loss function is minimized to obtain the classifier. Against a backdrop of the development of mathematical programming, nowadays learning algorithms based on loss functions are widely applied to real-world data analysis. In addition, statistical properties of such learning algorithms are well-understood based on a lots of theoretical works. On the other hand, some learning methods such as ν-SVM, mini-max probability machine (MPM) can be formulated as minimum distance problems. In the <b>minimum</b> distance <b>approach,</b> firstly, the so-called uncertainty set is defined for each binary label based on the training samples.

50|$|Calculation of <b>minimum</b> <b>approach</b> {{distances}} {{take account}} of switching surges and other transients. Transmission systems are often fitted with coordinated protection devices called autoreclosers, which are circuit breakers that automatically attempt to remake a circuit after a fault. In the event that a fault did occur it would be most undesirable for the autorecloser to re-energise the circuit because the limits of approach would be greatly reduced and the workers' position could be compromised. Hence, auto-reclosing equipment is rendered inoperative while live working takes place. Additional protection against unplanned overvoltage events (such as switching surges) can be provided {{by means of a}} surge diverter known as portable protective air gap.|$|E
5000|$|The {{weight of}} an {{aircraft}} {{is one of}} the basic factors that determines the length of the landing roll of an aircraft. An increase in weight increases the stall speed of an aircraft.

The kinetic energy in case of heavier aircraft is higher and the brakes have to absorb this greater energy, increasing the landing run of an aircraft.|$|E
50|$|A close solar passage {{can be used}} to {{increase}} a craft's energy. The increased radiation pressure combines with the efficacy of being deep in the Sun's gravity well to substantially increase the energy for runs to the outer Solar System. The optimal approach to the Sun is done by increasing the orbital eccentricity while keeping the energy level as high as practical. The <b>minimum</b> <b>approach</b> distance is a function of sail angle, thermal properties of the sail and other structure, load effects on structure, and sail optical characteristics (reflectivity and emissivity). A close passage can result in substantial optical degradation. Required turn rates can increase substantially for a close passage. A sail craft arriving at a star can use a close passage to reduce energy, which also applies to a sail craft on a return trip from the outer Solar System.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBecause {{of their}} {{capabilities}} to generate plasmas {{that are not}} confined between electrodes, low-temperature plasma jets offer unique opportunities for applications such as material processing and biomedicine. The need to generate multiple jets in order to cover larger treatment areas has recently become desirable. However, the interaction between neighbouringjets is unavoidable. It is therefore crucial to elucidate the physical processes that occur between jets. In this paper we present the case of two counter-propagating jets generated bytwo DBD-based devices. We show that the plasma bullets emitted by the two jets {{interact with each other}} as soon as they leave their respective DBD device, resulting in a decrease in their velocities. The bullets do not actually meet but rather approach each other at a <b>minimum</b> <b>approach</b> distance. The location of the region of <b>minimum</b> <b>approach</b> is not midway between the nozzles of the jet devices but rather depends on the operating conditions. In addition, we discovered the emergence of a ‘secondary’ discharge exactly in the region of <b>minimum</b> <b>approach.</b> This discharge exhibits a pink glow, reminiscent of the pink afterglow occurring in some nitrogen discharges. Time-resolved spectroscopic measurements and current measurement analysis showed that the pink glow is a transient negative glow discharge thatcannot be attributed to kinetic processes associated with re-excitation of nitrogen molecules.

We employed an experimental design to measure the heart rate and behaviour of Royal penguins on Macquarie Island, Australia, in response to a single pedestrian visit using the current recommended approach distance of 5 m for visitors. Penguins showed increased heart rate (1. 23 times average resting heart rate) and vigilance (six-fold increase), suggested to be a precursor to a flight or fight response, however, no penguins fled their nests. These responses were significantly greater than observed during Subantarctic skua overflights, suggesting incubating Royal penguins viewed a single pedestrian at 5 m as a greater threat than a predator overflight. Single persons using the current <b>minimum</b> <b>approach</b> guideline when visiting incubating Royal penguins appear unlikely to elicit responses considered greater than minor or transitory, consistent with activities that are considered acceptable by current management arrangements on Macquarie Island.
