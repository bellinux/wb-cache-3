500|$|After a {{short period}} of inactivity, Dickinson once again teamed up with Roy Z and Tribe of Gypsies to record his next album, Accident of Birth; [...] "It was {{actually}} Roy that dragged <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> some assemblance, because he called up and he said, 'Listen, I've got some stuff and it's like a metal record.' And I wasn't thrilled, I wasn't really sure that I had anything to offer... Then he played me some backing-tracks he'd done for what was to become Accident of Birth down the phone and I thought 'There is something there.'" [...] Former Iron Maiden guitarist, Adrian Smith, was asked to guest on the record, but remained as a full-time member of Dickinson's solo outfit. The album marked a return to heavy metal for Dickinson, with Sputnikmusic remarking, [...] "The album's heavy feel is very satisfying, and definitely fills that void left by Maiden during the 90's." [...] The follow-up, The Chemical Wedding, was a semi-concept album on alchemy, which drew inspiration from William Blake's writings; with some songs, such as [...] "Book of Thel", having the same title as some of his poems, and the cover artwork featuring one of his paintings. The record was even more successful than its predecessor, with Sputnikmusic commenting, [...] "Bruce had shattered all expectations to create an album that might even be better than the previous one." [...] During The Chemical Weddings supporting tour, the live album, Scream for Me Brazil was recorded in São Paulo, after which Dickinson and Smith returned to Iron Maiden in February 1999.|$|E
500|$|From 1953 to 1967, O'Hara had a {{relationship}} with Enrique Parra, a wealthy Mexican politician and banker. She met him at a restaurant during a trip to Mexico in 1951. O'Hara stated that Parra [...] "saved me from the darkness of an abusive marriage and brought <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the warm light of life again. Leaving him {{was one of the most}} painful things I have ever had to do." [...] As her relationship with Parra progressed, she began to learn Spanish and even enrolled her daughter in a Mexican school. She moved in 1953 to a smaller property at 10677 Somma Way in Bel Air, amid frequent visits to Mexico City, where she and Parra were very well-known celebrities. She hired a detective to follow Parra in Mexico and found that he was being fully honest about the relationship with his ex-wife and that she could trust him. John Ford intensely disliked Parra, and it affected her relationship with Ford in the 1950s as he often interfered in her affairs and frowned upon the demise of her marriage to Price, being a devout Catholic like O'Hara. Price also continued to harass O'Hara for dating Parra and filed a case against her on 20 June 1955, seeking custody of Bronwyn and accusing her of immorality. O'Hara filed a countersuit, charging him with contempt of court for refusing to pay $50 a month in child support and a $7 a month alimony. During the publicity stage of The Long Gray Line in 1955, Ford insulted O'Hara and her brother Charles when he remarked to Charles, [...] "if that whore sister of yours can pull herself away from that Mexican long enough to do a little publicity for us, the film might have a chance at some decent returns".|$|E
2500|$|In April 2014, at {{the time}} of the auction of Gallagher's Patrick Eggle 'JS Berlin Legend' guitar, the BBC noted: [...] "Eric Clapton {{credited}} him with ‘getting <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the blues’. The Rolling Stones wanted him to replace Mick Taylor and when Jimi Hendrix was asked how it felt to be the world's greatest guitarist, he is reported to have said: ‘I don't know, go ask Rory Gallagher’" [...] (but this may be a variant of an urban legend [...] ).|$|E

60|$|The faces thicken round me. A large looming, rubicund visage smiles kindly on <b>me,</b> {{bringing}} <b>back</b> <b>into</b> {{my heart}} the old, odd mingling of instinctive liking held in check by conscientious disapproval. I turn from it, {{and see a}} massive, clean-shaven face, with the ugliest mouth and the loveliest eyes I ever have known in a man.|$|R
2500|$|The last {{children}} {{to come to}} Bunce Court were orphaned Nazi concentration camp survivors who no longer knew what normal life was like. One such boy was Sidney Finkel, born Sevek Finkelstein in Poland, who survived the Piotrkow ghetto, deportation to a slave labour camp, separation from his family and imprisonment at Czestochowa, Buchenwald and Theresienstadt concentration camps. He arrived in England in August 1945 {{at the age of}} 14 and, along with 10 other Polish boys, was sent to Bunce Court. Traumatized, he and the others were treated with love and care. In his 2006 memoir, Sevek and the Holocaust: The Boy Who Refused to Die, he said his two years at Bunce Court [...] "turned <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> a human being".|$|E
2500|$|Craig Marks of Billboard {{said that}} along with [...] "California Gurls", the songs [...] "are {{textbook}} summer singles whose ingenious pop hooks and zillion-dollar drum tracks are stamped with Perry's knack for a memorable line and frothy, gum-snapping persona." [...] As of January 2015, Billboard also named [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] as the second best song of 2010s (so far). James Montgomery of MTV commented that [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] showed a [...] "definite change of pace for Perry. While it's still as saccharine sweet as her previous hits, there's also a rather, well, mature quality to it (despite the title)." [...] Amos Barshad of New York said, [...] "Right now, it's feeling a bit too earnest, and not nearly as catchy as the follow-up single from Perry's first album ('Hot n Cold,' most definitely still a jam). That said, we are now mentally preparing ourselves for its ubiquity." [...] Alyssa Rosenberg of The Atlantic dismissed the lyrics as [...] "simply annoying and incoherent" [...] and added that [...] "the hook and chorus aren't nearly compelling enough to pull <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2006 interview, Cornell {{revealed}} {{that at the}} age of 14, he had a bad PCP experience and suffered from panic disorder and agoraphobia. [...] "I had a bad PCP [...] experience when I was 14 and I got panic disorder. And of course, I wasn't telling anyone the truth. It's not like you go to your dad or your doctor and say, 'Yeah, I smoked PCP and I'm having a bad time.' So I became more or less agoraphobic because I'd have flashbacks. From 14 to 16, I didn't have any friends. I stayed home most of the time. Up till then life was pretty great. The world was big and I felt I could do anything I wanted. Suddenly, I felt like I couldn't do anything. But in the isolation, my imagination really had time to run. I never did any drugs until my late 20s. Unfortunately, being a child of two alcoholics, I started drinking a lot, and that's what eventually got <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> drugs. You often hear that pot leads to harder drugs. But I think alcohol is what leads you to everything, because it takes away the fear. The worst drug experimentation I ever did was because I was drunk and didn't care." ...|$|E

60|$|After I {{came back}} from our three months' trip on the continent, with my health greatly restored, my spirits rose proportionately; and as I had nothing to throw <b>me</b> <b>back</b> again <b>into</b> my old state, with the {{exception}} of the shock I received at the news of Angela Harmer's death, I really began to look at things in a more hopeful way, and to think that the eight years--no, the seven years and a half--I was getting very particular as to dates--which were to elapse before Percy started on his return from India, were not such a hopelessly long time to look forward to after all.|$|R
60|$|It {{struck me}} as so unkind, his having gone off in that way, that I burst into tears; and Uncle John came out, and led <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the house.|$|E
60|$|I {{rose from}} {{my chair and}} he from his. Then with a little {{confidential}} chuckle of laughter, he patted me {{two or three times}} on the chest, finally pushing <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> my chair.|$|E
60|$|I was too sorrowful {{to discuss}} the question, which would {{possibly}} have been beyond me under any circumstances; and Mr. Omer took <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the parlour, breathing with some difficulty on the way.|$|E

You came, I suppose, {{at one of the}} times--if some people are right. I admit that I am a visionary. My {{imagination}} runs away with me, and I say and do strange things. On those occasions, anybody who reminds me of that horrible Trial throws <b>me</b> <b>back</b> again <b>into</b> the past, and causes me unutterable nervous suffering. I am a very tender-hearted man. As the necessary consequence (in such a world as this), I am a miserable wretch. Accept my excuses. Come in, both of you. Come in and pity me." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{returned}} {{to the wall and}} began to climb up. Lop-Ear, who was shivering and peeping alongside of <b>me,</b> scrambled <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the cave. It was plain that Red-Eye was bent upon murder. I was desperate and angry and fairly cool. Running back and forth along the neighboring ledges, I gathered a heap of rocks at the cave-entrance. Red-Eye was now several yards beneath me, concealed for the moment by an out-jut of the cliff. As he climbed, his head came into view, and I banged a rock down. It missed, striking the wall and shattering; but the flying dust and grit filled his eyes and he drew back out of view.|$|R
60|$|As the surf-boat {{neared the}} shore, I heard voices behind me, and, turning round, beheld a sight which sent <b>me</b> {{completely}} <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the 1820 days. It was {{a band of}} gentlemen in black--black from the crowns of their heads to the soles of their feet, {{with the exception of}} their lips and teeth and eyes. Here was the Simon Pure in very truth. They were so-called Red Kafirs, because of their habit of painting their bodies and blankets with red ochre. At this time the paint had been washed off, and the blankets laid aside. They were quite naked, fresh from the lands of their nativity, and apparently fit for anything.|$|R
6000|$|... "I ask not for gold, nor any oar, {{but that}} which carries {{me to the}} Lagunes in the morning, and brings <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the canals at night. Give me my child, or give me nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she answered, drawing <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the shadows, [...] "I understand. My father {{seems very}} much upset, almost mad, indeed. If the Vrouw Prinsloo's tongue {{had been a}} snake's fang, {{it could not have}} stung him worse." ...|$|E
6000|$|I rose to go, but Holmes {{caught me}} by the wrist and pushed <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> my chair. [...] "It is both, or none," [...] said he. [...] "You may say before this gentleman {{anything}} which you may say to me." ...|$|E
60|$|Mastering my not unnatural anxiety, I {{opened the}} door a little farther and slipped out into the passage, all my {{instincts}} of chivalry towards beauty in distress aroused by those piteous cries. Forgetful of every possible danger and of all prudence, I had already darted down the corridor, determined to do my duty as a gentleman as soon as I had ascertained whence had come those cries of anguish, when I heard the frou-frou of skirts and a rapid patter of small feet down the stairs. The next moment a radiant vision, all white muslin, fair curls and the scent of violets, descended on me from above, a soft hand closed over mine and drew <b>me,</b> unresisting, <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the room from whence I had just come.|$|R
60|$|Ajor and I {{had gone}} perhaps {{a mile or}} two and were just about to emerge from a dense wood when I saw that ahead of us which caused <b>me</b> to draw <b>back</b> <b>into</b> concealment, at the same time pushing Ajor behind me.

From the {{direction}} of their march I saw that they were returning to their caves, and that if we remained where we were, they would pass without discovering us.|$|R

60|$|The {{next day}} was utterly black with my sense of that ugly creature's body. I am the least superstitious of men, but it drew me. It drew <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> those {{thickets}} to the very place where I had hidden him.|$|E
60|$|I was on {{the point}} of {{stepping}} boldly out into the room when a slight noise behind me warned <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the shadows of a recess in the corridor. Dragging Woola after me I crouched low in the darkness.|$|E
60|$|As {{the last}} wailing notes died away the wind {{came down with}} a rush and a whirl and the sweep as of a {{thousand}} wings, and threw <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the house, bringing the door to with a crash after me.|$|E
6000|$|As one {{of those}} candidates, I may be {{permitted}} to say, that I feel much {{in the frame of}} mind of the Irish bricklayer's labourer, who bet another that he could not carry him {{to the top of the}} ladder in his hod. The challenged hodman won his wager, but as the stakes were handed over, the challenger wistfully remarked, [...] "I'd great hopes of falling at the third round from the top." [...] And, in view of the work and the worry which awaits the members of the School Boards, I must confess to an occasional ungrateful hope that the friends who are toiling upwards with me in their hod, may, when they reach [...] "the third round from the top," [...] let <b>me</b> fall <b>back</b> <b>into</b> peace and quietness.|$|R
60|$|At those dinner-tables {{referred}} to, I {{have often}} been asked, as {{many of you have}} been, if I could tell how it happened, that when a pine wood was cut down an oak one commonly sprang up, and vice versa. To which I have answered, and now answer, that I can tell,--that it is no mystery to me. As I am not aware that this has been clearly shown by any one, I shall lay the more stress on this point. Let <b>me</b> lead you <b>back</b> <b>into</b> your wood-lots again.|$|R
6000|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, it was purely {{accidental}} that I came down in the woods. I am reasonably certain that I had no more control then than a thing in a parcel. I remember I felt a sort of wincing, [...] "Now it comes!" [...] as the trees rushed up to me. If I remember that, I should remember steering. Then the propeller smashed, everything stopped with a jerk, and I was falling into a mass of yellowing leaves, and Lord Roberts A, so it seemed to <b>me,</b> was going <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the sky.|$|R
