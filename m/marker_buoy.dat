5|$|A surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoy</b> (SMB) with a reel {{and line}} {{is often used}} by a dive leader to allow the boat to monitor {{progress}} of the dive group. This can provide the operator with a positive control of depth, by remaining slightly negative and using the buoyancy of the float to support this slight over-weighting. This allows the line to be kept under slight tension which {{reduces the risk of}} entanglement. The reel or spool used to store and roll up the line usually has slightly negative buoyancy, so that if released it will hang down and not float away.|$|E
5|$|A delayed or {{deployable}} surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoy</b> (DSMB) is a soft inflatable tube {{which is}} attached to a reel or spool line at one end, and is inflated by the diver under water and released to float to the surface, deploying the line as it ascends. This provides information to the surface that the diver is about to ascend, and where he is. This equipment is commonly used by recreational and technical divers, and requires a certain level of skill to operate safely. They are mostly used to signal the boat that the diver has started ascent or to indicate a problem in technical diving.|$|E

Once deployed, it can be used for the same purposes as the standard surface marker and reel, and in the same way, but they are mostly used to signal the boat that the diver has started ascent or to indicate a problem in technical diving.|$|E
50|$|There may be local rules {{pertaining}} {{to the use of}} surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoys.</b> In some parts of the world, surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoys</b> alone are not legally sufficient signaling devices, and one of the international diver down flags (in an appropriate size), might be required while drift diving.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, Tideland Signal {{provided}} SB‐30 lateral <b>marker</b> <b>buoys</b> {{and three}} DM‐390 buoys for {{use during the}} Vancouver Winter Olympics.|$|R
5000|$|Accessories - Their {{accessories}} line includes dive torches, knives, Surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoys,</b> diving sportswear, bags, weight belts, hangers, dry boxes etc.|$|R
25|$|Western Channel Pile Light was {{established}} in 1924, replacing a <b>marker</b> <b>buoy,</b> together with Eastern Channel Pile Light.|$|E
25|$|Use {{of surface}} marker buoys: A surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoy</b> {{is useful to}} {{indicate}} {{the position of the}} diver to people on the surface. Control of line tension is important to prevent entanglement and snagging.|$|E
25|$|A surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoy</b> line {{may be used}} {{to signal}} to the diver below, either by pre-arranged pull signals, or by sending down a weight clipped to the line and {{carrying}} a message.|$|E
50|$|Boats {{that have}} come off their {{moorings}} are not normally classified as wreck as {{they have not been}} abandoned without hope of recovery. Also, <b>buoys</b> including <b>marker</b> <b>buoys,</b> mooring buoys etc., other than those that are fishing equipment, are not normally classed as wreck.|$|R
25|$|A {{group of}} moored surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoys</b> {{may be used}} to demarcate an area in which diving is taking place. This {{is more likely to be}} used by commercial, {{scientific}} or public service divers to cordon off a work or search area, or an accident or crime scene.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} were {{modified to}} carry dinghies, <b>marker</b> <b>buoys</b> and flares on their bomb racks. The {{mission of the}} unit was to locate pilots who had bailed out over the North Sea and would drop liferafts and inform sea-based rescue units who would then pick up the pilots.|$|R
25|$|A surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoy</b> (SMB) {{tethered}} to a diver is usually towed on {{a thin line}} attached to a reel, spool or other device which allows the diver to control the line length, so that excessive slack line can be avoided.|$|E
25|$|The purge button is {{also used}} by {{recreational}} divers to inflate a delayed surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoy</b> or lifting bag. Any time that the purge button is operated, the diver {{must be aware of}} the potential for a freeflow and be ready to deal with it.|$|E
25|$|Mooring {{involves}} (a) beaching the boat, (b) {{drawing in}} the mooring {{point on the}} line (where the <b>marker</b> <b>buoy</b> is located), (c) attaching to the mooring line to the boat, and (d) then pulling the boat out {{and away from the}} beach {{so that it can be}} accessed at all tides.|$|E
25|$|An {{emergency}} response team was {{to remain on}} standby should the vessel begin leaking fuel and an exclusion zone was set up around {{the location of the}} ship with <b>marker</b> <b>buoys</b> to stop all ships and surfers from entering the area. In addition on 25 June 2007 an air exclusion zone was created around the ship.|$|R
50|$|Divers {{often use}} guidelines, surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoys,</b> diving shots, lightsticks and strobe lights to {{indicate}} their position to their surface support team. A standard precaution when entering enclosed spaces {{is to use a}} guideline; this marks the exit route, which may be needed after the diver's fins, wash, and bubbles dislodge silt and loose overhead materials such as rust which can reduce visibility to near zero.|$|R
50|$|The 1.2 mi swim course {{begins at}} the Lynch Ramp. The race starts in waves, with the {{professional}} men, the professional women, age group men, age group women, and relay teams. Swimmers swim in a clockwise direction on a rectangular course. There are course <b>marker</b> <b>buoys</b> and lifeguards on kayaks lining the course. Swimmers exit the water, go up the ramp, through the timing area and into the transition area.|$|R
25|$|Surfacing at the shot-line, group surface marker, or {{personal}} <b>marker</b> <b>buoy</b> increases {{the visibility of}} a diver, and {{reduces the risk of}} not being noticed by a passing vessel. This will reduce the risks both of being run down and of being lost at the surface. It also provides an additional flotation device in case of fatigue.|$|E
25|$|Spock gets {{a visual}} of Balok, a grotesque, blue-skinned {{humanoid}} with a frightening face. Balok ignores Kirk's greetings and announces {{that he will}} destroy the Enterprise for trespassing into First Federation territory and destroying the <b>marker</b> <b>buoy.</b> He gives the crew only ten minutes to pray to their deities. Bailey succumbs to his fears, rants irrationally and Kirk orders him off the bridge.|$|E
25|$|A surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoy</b> {{on a line}} held by the diver {{indicates}} {{the position of the}} diver to the surface personnel. This may be an inflatable marker deployed by the diver {{at the end of the}} dive, or a sealed float, towed for the whole dive. A surface marker also allows easy and accurate control of ascent rate and stop depth for safer decompression.|$|E
50|$|At {{some point}} between the wars the O class was {{modified}} for improved {{safety in the}} event of sinking. Two <b>marker</b> <b>buoys</b> were added fore and aft. In the event the submarine was stranded on the bottom the buoys could be released to show the submarine's position. A motor room hatch was also added, the motor room being the aftermost compartment. The tapered after casing became a step {{as a result of these}} modifications.|$|R
50|$|Reels and spools: Sidemount divers will {{typically}} carry {{one or more}} reels/spools. In open-water {{these may}} be used for deployment of delayed surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoys</b> (DSMB). In overhead environments, these will include a primary guideline and safety/jump spools - in like with cave or technical wreck diving protocols. These are typically attached to the diver on rear D-rings, normally on the butt-plate or rear waist strap, to prevent them dangling below the diver.|$|R
50|$|The main {{mission of}} the SHN is to provide safe {{navigation}} on national waters. The service do so with the creation and maintenance of nautical charts, coastal <b>marker</b> <b>buoys,</b> and lighthouses. In concordance to the International Maritime Organization regulations, the SHN is also the global coordinator for the NAVAREA VI zone, which covers the South West Atlantic Ocean region being responsible for emitting alerts to ships at sea and coordinating search and rescue operations.|$|R
25|$|Following {{shakedown}} {{training off}} Key West, Florida, in June, Hummingbird underwent minesweeping training at Charleston, South Carolina, in July. From 21 October to 14 November, she {{took part in}} her first amphibious exercises, sweeping the landing area and dropping <b>marker</b> <b>buoy</b> to guide the simulated assault {{on the shores of}} North Carolina. Arriving New York 8 January 1956, she took part in surveying work for the Hydrographic Office until 15 February, after which Hummingbird returned to Charleston.|$|E
25|$|A deployable, or delayed surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoy</b> (DSMB) is an {{inflatable}} marker which the diver inflates while underwater and sends {{up at the}} end of a line to indicate position, and usually either that he or she is ascending, or that there is a problem. The use of a DSMB is common when divers expect to do decompression stops away from a fixed reference, or will be surfacing in an area with boat traffic, or need to indicate their position to the dive boat or surface team.|$|E
25|$|A diver who has {{deployed}} a Delayed Surface <b>Marker</b> <b>Buoy</b> (DSMB) {{at the end}} of a dive may use a pre-arranged {{colour code}} to indicate if there is a problem. In some circles a yellow DSMB is considered an emergency signal, and red means OK. In most circles a second DSMB deployed on the same line will indicate a problem. A DSMB can also be used to carry up a slate with a message, but this is unlikely to be noticed unless a special arrangement has been made.|$|E
25|$|Permanently buoyant or {{inflatable}} surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoys</b> {{may be used}} {{to identify}} and/or mark the presence of a diver below. These may be moored, as a shotline, and indicate the general area with divers, or tethered to one of the divers by a line, indicating the location of the group to people at the surface. This type of buoy is usually brightly coloured for visibility, and may be fitted with one of the diving flag signals.|$|R
40|$|AbstractLast year I {{described}} the revolution that HB LEDs {{brought to the}} navigational buoy industry. Since then, HB-LEDs {{have been used as}} sealed units in <b>marker</b> <b>buoys</b> by the local fishermen in New England and now they are being extended to the boating public. The latest benefit being provided by the ever improving LED is that of navigational safety in the form of LED based watertight housings and snap-in replacements for prior generations of marine navigational bulbs...|$|R
50|$|Tekesta reached Kwajalein Atoll on 1 February and {{remained}} in the Marshalls-Gilberts area {{for the next two}} months, retracting beached and broached landing craft, laying <b>marker</b> <b>buoys,</b> assisting fueling operations, and performing other salvage and towing operations necessary {{in the aftermath of the}} occupation of the Marshall Islands. During this tour of duty, the tug visited Tarawa in the Gilbert Islands and Nanumea in the Ellice Islands as well as Kwajalein, Eniwetok, and Majuro in the Marshalls.|$|R
25|$|Open circuit scuba has no {{provision}} for using the breathing gas more than once for respiration. The gas inhaled from the scuba equipment is exhaled to the environment, or occasionally into another item of equipment for a special purpose, usually to increase buoyancy of a lifting device such as a buoyancy compensator, inflatable surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoy</b> or small lifting bag. The breathing gas is generally provided from a high-pressure diving cylinder through a scuba regulator. By always providing the appropriate breathing gas at ambient pressure, demand valve regulators ensure the diver can inhale and exhale naturally and without excessive effort, regardless of depth, as and when needed.|$|E
25|$|The bag {{or set of}} bags is used to {{lift the}} load {{directly}} to the surface. This is simple, {{but there is a}} risk if the lift bag is too large and cannot be vented fast enough the lift may get out of control and ascend so fast that the bag breaks the surface, capsizes and collapses, losing so much air that it then cannot support the weight of the load, and will then sink back to the bottom. If there is a <b>marker</b> <b>buoy</b> attached it will at least not be lost. A lift bag which is only slightly larger than needed to support the load will ascend more slowly, and is less likely to capsize at the surface, as excess air will be spilled continuously during the ascent.|$|E
25|$|These are {{generally}} used in conditions of low visibility where a diver {{is connected to}} another person, either another diver or a tender on the surface, by a rope. These {{date back to the}} time of the use of Standard diving dress. Some of these signals, or pre-arranged variants, can be used with a surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoy.</b> The diver pulls down on the buoy line to make the buoy bob in an equivalent pattern to the rope signal. Effective rope signals need a free line without much slack, Before attempting a rope signal, the slack must be taken up, and the line pulled firmly. Most signals are acknowledged by returning the same signal, which shows that it was received accurately. Persistent failure to acknowledge may indicate a serious problem and should be resolved as a matter of urgency. There are several systems in use, and it is necessary to have agreement between diver and tender before the dive.|$|E
50|$|Reels for {{distance}} lines {{may have a}} locking mechanism, ratchet or adjustable drag to control deployment {{of the line and}} a winding handle to help keep slack line under control and rewind line. Lines are used in open water to deploy surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoys</b> and decompression buoys and link the buoy on the surface to the submerged diver, or may be used to allow easy return navigation to a point such as a shotline or boat anchor.|$|R
50|$|Permanently buoyant or {{inflatable}} surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoys</b> {{may be used}} {{to identify}} and/or mark the presence of a diver below. These may be moored, as a shotline, and indicate the general area with divers, or tethered to one of the divers by a line, indicating the location of the group to people at the surface. This type of buoy is usually brightly coloured for visibility, and may be fitted with one of the diving flag signals.|$|R
50|$|Divers are spaced {{out across}} the {{direction}} of current flow and search as they are carried over the bottom by the current. They would usually be monitored from the surface using <b>marker</b> <b>buoys</b> so that the effectiveness of coverage can be assessed, and the search {{is likely to be}} most effective in good visibility and in areas where the current velocity is reasonably consistent. This is very similar in effect to the swimline visual search, and the techniques can be combined.|$|R
