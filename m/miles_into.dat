5|$|After {{crossing}} from East Lenox, PA106 continues southeastward through {{fields and}} soon into {{a region of}} residences. The southeastern stretch continues for several <b>miles</b> <b>into</b> the community of West Clifford. There, PA106 passes some homes and intersects with PA374. The two designations become concurrent, paralleling the alignment of the Milford and Owego Turnpike Road through West Clifford. PA106 and PA374 head southward and soon turn southwestward through forestry, until clearing into the community of Royal. In the small community, PA106 and PA374 fork, with PA374 heading southwestward to Glenwood and PA106 heading southeastward through Royal. PA106 continues further, entering deep woods once again after leaving Royal. At the intersection with Cemetery Road, the highway enters a large cemetery and into Clifford. There, the route crosses through a large residential and commercial community, intersecting with State Route2008 (SR2008). The route continues southeastward through the residential area before crossing the county line into Lackawanna County.|$|E
5|$|At {{the heart}} of the Combine's command {{structure}} in Half-Life 2 is the Citadel, an enormous structure of Combine construction, reaching approximately 2.6 kilometres (1.6 <b>miles)</b> <b>into</b> the sky from ground level, and delving deep underground. Located within City 17, the Citadel serves as the primary headquarters of the Combine, housing both Combine Advisors and the office of the Earth administrator, Wallace Breen. Breen is frequently seen on large screens around the city from which he spreads propaganda. The Citadel projects an energy field that is able to prevent human reproduction, as well as a field that keeps dangerous alien wildlife out of the city. In addition, the Citadel contains a trans-dimensional teleporter which allows the Combine to travel between their native universe and Earth. The Citadel also contains construction facilities for various synthetic Combine combat machines.|$|E
5|$|Dacite eruptions in the Lassen area {{typically}} {{begin with}} steam explosions {{caused by the}} interaction of rising magma with ground water. When dacite magma charged with volcanic gases reaches the surface, it erupts explosively, usually as a vertical column of gas and ash that can rise several <b>miles</b> <b>into</b> the atmosphere. Heavy fallback of hot ash and rock fragments from eruption columns may generate highly mobile pyroclastic flows that can rush several miles down a volcano's slopes and adjacent valleys. Fallout from the eruption column can blanket areas within a few miles (~8km) of the vent with {{a thick layer of}} pumice, and high-altitude winds may carry finer ash tens to hundreds of miles from the volcano, posing a hazard to flying aircraft, particularly those with jet engines.|$|E

5|$|SR 605 {{runs through}} the northeastern corner of Franklin County and the southeastern portion of Delaware County. 5,470 {{vehicles}} travel the road on average daily near the southern terminus, and 3,840 near the northern terminus. It starts at a signalized intersection with US 62 in downtown New Albany. The route quickly leaves downtown New Albany and heads northward. SR 605 soon crosses over SR 161 using a bridge, and intersects Walton Parkway. Here, houses slowly transition to farmland. The road then intersects Bevelheimer Road and crosses into Delaware County, {{in the middle of}} large fields. A few <b>miles</b> <b>into</b> Delaware County, SR 605 crosses Center Village Road in the unincorporated village of Center Village. Soon after, SR 605 ends at the signalized intersection of SR 37 and continues as County Road 605.|$|E
5|$|Silver, he writes, {{does not}} occur in native form {{and has to be}} mined, usually {{occurring}} with lead ores. Spain produced the most silver in his time, many of the mines having been started by Hannibal. One of the largest had galleries running up to two <b>miles</b> <b>into</b> the mountain, while men worked day and night draining the mine in shifts. Pliny is probably referring to the reverse overshot water-wheels operated by treadmill and found in Roman mines. Britain, he says, is very rich in lead, which is found on the surface at many places, and thus very easy to extract; production was so high that a law was passed attempting to restrict mining.|$|E
5|$|The Lancaster {{was denied}} as a {{large-scale}} or long-term replacement. The Chief of the Air Staff, Portal, argued {{it was the}} only aircraft capable of carrying an 8,000lb bomb to Berlin and could not be spared. As a result, the RAF official history does not include the Lancaster as a Coastal Command aircraft. With a range of 2,350 miles it could have been invaluable. The Boeing Fortress was given to the service only because the Air Ministry considered it unfit as a heavy bomber. It issued a directive on 27 January 1942 stating all Fortresses were to given over to Coastal Command for A/S operations. No. 59 Squadron RAF, No. 206 Squadron RAF and No. 220 Squadron RAF all used the Fortress as successful reconnaissance aircraft. However, the bulk of the force by early 1942 was still medium-range aircraft, which could now reach only 600 <b>miles</b> <b>into</b> the Atlantic. U-boats were now operating at 700 miles plus.|$|E

50|$|There is {{a section}} of reef {{extending}} from the shoreline for about half a <b>mile</b> <b>into</b> the English Channel. The hinterland of Brook rises steeply from the coastal road to join the chalk spine which stretches {{from one end of}} the Island to the other.|$|R
5|$|In heavy rain, Baker {{took off}} and began to level off at 600 feet. A quarter of a <b>mile</b> <b>into</b> the flight, the engine failed. The plane was {{generally}} easy to crash-land if necessary, something he had done previously {{at the cost of}} a few broken ribs.|$|R
25|$|East of {{the center}} are mostly lower-income areas with some middle-class neighborhoods such as Jardín Balbuena. Urban sprawl {{continues}} further east for many <b>miles</b> <b>into</b> the State of Mexico, including Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl, now increasingly middle-class, but once full of informal settlements. These kind of slums are now found on the eastern edges of the metropolitan area in the Chalco area.|$|E
25|$|Trains often raced {{one another}} {{so as to}} be the first to arrive at their destination. Racing was {{encouraged}} by the fact that in many areas, the two lines were only several hundred feet apart. On the Cape May lines, the trains were in sight of each other for 11 miles between Cape May Court House and Cape May. Over the last 5 <b>miles</b> <b>into</b> Cape May, the tracks were only 50 feet apart.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{conversion}} factor 1.609344 for miles to kilometers {{is close to}} the golden ratio (denoted φ), the decomposition of distance in <b>miles</b> <b>into</b> a sum of Fibonacci numbers becomes nearly the kilometer sum when the Fibonacci numbers are replaced by their successors. This method amounts to a radix 2 number register in golden ratio base φ being shifted. To convert from kilometers to miles, shift the register down the Fibonacci sequence instead.|$|E

25|$|On 9 October 1918, while escorting , Shaws rudder jammed {{just as she}} was {{completing}} the right leg of a zigzag, leaving her headed directly towards the transport. A moment later, Aquitania struck Shaw, cutting off 90 feet of the destroyer's bow, mangling her bridge and setting her on fire. Shaws crew heroically brought her damage under control, and a skeleton crew of 21 men took the wreck 40 <b>miles</b> <b>into</b> port under her own power. 12 men died in the accident.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} flew on a 150 {{degree course}} toward Benina Airfield. The craft radioed for a directional {{reading from the}} HF/DF station at Benina and received a reading of 330 degrees from Benina. The actions of the pilot in flying 440 <b>miles</b> <b>into</b> the desert, however, indicate the navigator probably took a reciprocal reading {{off the back of}} the radio directional loop antenna from a position beyond and south of Benina but 'on course'. The pilot flew into the desert, thinking he was still over the Mediterranean and on his way to Benina.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, {{with the}} assistance of further artillery, Stuka dive bomber strikes, the 218th was able to pierce the French defenses, together with 22st1 and 239th infantry divisions. By 19 June, the division had advanced a further 15 <b>miles</b> <b>into</b> the Vosges Mountains. The French Army {{was in a state of}} collapse, as on the previous day, Guderian's Panzer forces had reached the Swiss border, effectively surrounding the French defenders in the Vosges and 3 days later the armistice was signed at Compiègne, marking the end of hostilities.|$|E

25|$|Concurrent ground {{operations}} – The KLA undertook operations in Kosovo itself {{and had some}} successes against Serb forces. The Yugoslav army abandoned a border post opposite Morinë near the Yugoslav army outpost at Kosare in the north west of the province. The Yugoslav army outpost at Kosare remained in Yugoslav hands throughout the war: this allowed for a supply line {{to be set up}} into the province and the subsequent taking of territory in the Junik area. The KLA also penetrated a few <b>miles</b> <b>into</b> the south-western Mount Pastrik area. But most of the province remained under Serb control.|$|E
25|$|During this time, {{a command}} of regular army units and California volunteers were {{organized}} at Fort Yuma on the Colorado River {{in order to}} defeat the Confederate invasion. The command, designated the California Column, was placed {{under the command of}} Colonel James H. Carleton and started eastward through New Mexico in March. They skirmished with a Confederate company at Stanwix Station on March 30, which is considered to be the westernmost engagement of the Civil War. Continuing towards the Rio Grande, Carleton made contact with Canby's force on June 29; he then advanced over one hundred <b>miles</b> <b>into</b> Texas.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1914 the Special Organization (Teşkilat-ı Mahsusa), {{assisted}} by government and army officials, conscripted Greek men of military age from Thrace and western Anatolia into Labour Battalions in which hundreds of thousands died. Sent hundreds of <b>miles</b> <b>into</b> the Interior of Anatolia, these conscripts were employed in road-making, building, tunnel excavating and other field work but their numbers were heavily reduced through either privations and ill-treatment or by outright massacre by their Ottoman guards. The policy of persecution and ethnic cleansing was expanded to {{other regions of the}} Empire including Pontus, Cappadocia and Cilicia.|$|E
60|$|Queen circled {{and wandered}} through the foggy, {{dripping}} forest until he headed down into a canyon.
