In 2000, when Rutten was PRIDE FC's color commentator, a third fight with Shamrock was entertained. Rutten agreed to come out of retirement to fight Shamrock in PRIDE FC. However, Shamrock stated that he already beat Rutten twice and that a third time wasn't necessary. Later, in 2002, Rutten said that he would not fight Shamrock again even if it was offered to him because of the friendship they developed over the years, and that he could not put his <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> into fighting Ken.|$|E
25|$|In {{significant}} respects, Jinsai {{can be seen}} as {{advancing the}} Neo-Confucian project that Zhu Xi, his chief philosophical adversary, had otherwise so effectively and persuasively championed. For example, Jinsai's most comprehensive philosophical text, the Gomō jigi (The Meanings of Philosophical Terms in the Analects and Mencius), was first recorded as Jinsai was giving a series of lectures on Chen Beixi's 陳北溪 (1156–1223) Xingli ziyi 性理字義 (The Meanings of Neo-Confucian Philosophical Terms). Much of the philosophical structure of Jinsai's Gomō jigi as well as its methodology of conceptual clarification and analysis clearly derive from Beixi's work. The two texts even share common elements in their titles, jigi and ziyi 字義 (Jpn: jigi) being written with the same characters, referring to the meanings of words. In both cases, however, the words that were discussed and defined were distinctively philosophical terms such as tendō (the way of heaven), tenmei (the decree of heaven), michi (the way), sei (human nature), kokoro (the <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> <b>heart),</b> kotowari (principle), kishin (ghosts and spirits), and many others.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the initial}} founders of Brook Farm was author Nathaniel Hawthorne. Hawthorne did not {{particularly}} agree with {{the ideals of the}} experiment, hoping only that it would help him raise enough money to begin his life with his wife-to-be Sophia Peabody. She considered moving there as well and even visited in May 1841, though Hawthorne sent her away. Ripley was aware of Hawthorne's motivations, and tried to convince him to get involved more fully by appointing him as one of four trustees, specifically overseeing [...] "Direction of Finance". After requesting his initial investment be returned, Hawthorne officially resigned from Brook Farm on October 17, 1842. He wrote of his displeasure with the community: [...] "even my Custom House experience was not such a thraldom and weariness; my <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> were freer.....Thank God, my soul is not utterly buried under a dung-heap." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Day 'n' Nite" [...] is the album's turning point, {{where it}} {{transitions}} from the drab theme of loneliness to vitality. Among the brighter songs are [...] "Enter Galactic (LoveConnection Part 1)", a [...] "trippy disco anthem" [...] that {{is inspired by}} when he and a female friend ate shrooms and listened to music by The Postal Service together. [...] "Make Her Say" [...] includes a sample of pop singers Lady Gaga's 2009 smash hit [...] "Poker Face" [...] and features verses from West and Common. It takes Gaga's naughty, mischievous central hook and turns it around to be an unrefined oral sex reference {{that makes it a}} [...] "hyper-catchy, forward-looking single." [...] He channels André 3000 in [...] "Cudi Zone". Man on the Moon: The End of Days closer is [...] "Up Up and Away", an escapist drug anthem single. Unlike other music's common theme of drugs being used as an escape from the unpleasant realities, this however, is about breaking free from the rough reality of someone's own <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> <b>heart.</b>|$|E
500|$|Given this {{reliance}} on literary sources, {{it is doubtful}} whether Nostradamus used any particular methods for entering a trance state, other than contemplation, meditation and incubation. His sole description {{of this process is}} contained in letter 41 of his collected Latin correspondence. The popular legend that he attempted the ancient methods of flame gazing, water gazing or both simultaneously is based on a naive reading of his first two verses, which merely liken his efforts to those of the Delphic and Branchidic oracles. The first of these is reproduced at the bottom of this article and the second can be seen by visiting the relevant facsimile site (see External Links). In his dedication to King Henri II, Nostradamus describes [...] "emptying my soul, <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> of all care, worry and unease through mental calm and tranquility", but his frequent references to the [...] "bronze tripod" [...] of the Delphic rite are usually preceded by the words [...] "as though" [...] (compare, once again, External References to the original texts).|$|E

500|$|At {{the core}} of his work is the concept of [...] "felicity", that highest state of bliss in which he {{describes}} the essence of God as a source of [...] "Delights of inestimable value." [...] It is a quest for this divine and essential truth that Traherne is said to exemplify a [...] "playful but passionate exposition, denoting both a profoundly enlivening experience and a practical set of interrelated abstract principles." [...] Traherne mixes mystical elements and seeks to explain issues of truth, knowledge, and the faculties of the <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> by methods of theological and rational examination. [...] He seeks to explain the [...] "Principle of Nature" [...] in which through his inclination to love truth ("Light") and beauty seek him to identify felicity as its source and a natural experience. [...] Traherne argues that man can only experience this felicity by understanding the will of God and divine love and he describes the beauty of this in childlike terms. [...] In a poem called [...] "The Recovery", Traherne claims: ...|$|E
500|$|According to Eliot biographer Lyndall Gordon, in [...] "Ash Wednesday" [...] and the Ariel poems, [...] "Eliot {{wonders if}} he does not belong to those who espouse Christianity officially without being {{properly}} committed, whose ostentatious piety is 'tainted with a self-conceit.'" [...] The poem is inherently tied to Eliot's religious conversion experience, and connected to Eliot's reading of Anglican divine Lancelot Andrewes during this time. Andrewes, in an 1619 Ash Wednesday sermon, emphasised that conversion [...] "must come from both <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> <b>heart,</b> thought and feeling, 'the principall and most proper act of a true turning to God.'" [...] Andrewes' words are channelled again, when Eliot's Simeon [...] "sees a faith that he cannot inhabit in [...] "the still unspeaking and unspoken Word'". Eliot uses the image of the winding staircase—an image that also appears in [...] "Ash Wednesday"—which Gordon indicates is a direct reference to Andrewes' sermon. According to Gordon, [...] "Eliot's penitent... 'turning on the winding stair', acts out the two mental turns Andrewes prescribed for a conversion: a turn that looks forward to God and a turn that looks backward to one’s sins, sentencing oneself for the past".|$|E

Case noted that the fallout to Sharon's lies are [...] "even bigger than she fears", as she had [...] "been on pins and needles for months". She also wants to protect Mariah, who has now become [...] "guilty by association". The scandal {{revolving}} around Sharon and [...] "Sully" [...] breaks on the television show GC Buzz, with Case stating: [...] "Sharon always knew the truth would come out. She {{was just trying to}} adjust her <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> to the inevitability, even though she was only making things worse." [...] Despite her crime, Case also described Sharon as a victim, and contended that this was not the worst thing Sharon has done. After losing Christian to Nick, Sharon decides to fight for a place in his life. CBS Soaps In Depth wrote that her frustration over no one willing to understand her [...] "is what finally lights a tiny flame of defiance deep inside Sharon". According to Case, [...] "Sharon is willing to do anything for her child. She's fighting for what she believes is right." ...|$|E
