40|$|It is {{important}} for monetary policy makers to know how closely money market rates follow the policy rates they set. This paper looks at the volatility and persistence of divergences between short-term market interest rates away from policy rates.

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether bank shareholders {{bear the burden}} of <b>required</b> <b>reserves</b> tax by analyzing the reaction of banks’ stock returns to the changes in the <b>required</b> <b>reserve</b> ratio. Results show that increases in reserve requirements significantly lower bank returns implying that shareholders share a portion of the <b>required</b> <b>reserve</b> tax. <b>Required</b> <b>reserves</b> changes are partially predicted by investors, and increases and decreases in <b>required</b> <b>reserve</b> rates have an asymmetric effect on stock returns. In addition, large and public banks bear a larger share of the tax, and the remuneration of reserves has important implications for the tax burden. Finally, some heterogeneity across banks exists as reflected by differences in the signs and magnitudes of the estimated coefficients.

30|$|This study proposes an {{energy-saving}} centric uplink scheduling (ESC-US) {{scheme to}} support efficient energy usage and satisfy {{the quality of}} service (QoS) requirements of Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMax) networks. The uplink resource allocation {{is different from that}} of the downlink resource allocation scheme because the uplink traffic is queued at the mobile station (MS) and the base station (BS) has no information regarding it without using a polling procedure. The considered resource scheduling schemes maximize the sleep efficiency and consider the QoS requirements of individual MSs. The proposed scheduling scheme in this study considers the delay budget of MSs with real-time connections and the <b>required</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>reserved</b> traffic rate (MRTR) of MSs with non-real time connections when maximizing sleep efficiency. Both scheduling schemes for the traffic of real-time polling services (rtPS) and non-real-time polling services (nrtPS) apply the ‘just enough QoS’ and ‘sleep before transmission’ (SbT) concepts to achieve this energy-saving centric objective. Exhaustive simulations were conducted to examine the performance of the proposed schemes. The simulation results show that both schemes guarantee the desired QoS and achieve superior energy-savings efficiencies compared to the conventional scheme.|$|R

In China, the <b>required</b> <b>reserves</b> system {{is one of the most}} important policies of the People’s Bank of China. In this study, using information from the Vector Auto-Regression Model and utilizing monthly data of the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), money supply, Consumer Price Index (CPI), and loan scale from January 2006 to March 2011, we quantitatively studied the effects of frequent increases in the RRR in China. We found that China’s monetary policy regarding <b>required</b> <b>reserves</b> has not had a significant effect on dealing with excess liquidity, preventing inflation or controlling increases in the loan scale. We briefly analyzed the reasons for the limited actual effects of China’s <b>required</b> <b>reserves</b> policy regarding the <b>required</b> <b>reserves</b> system, monetary transmission mechanism, system of forced Ren Min Bi sale, and purchase of foreign exchange...|$|R

The remuneration at the current policy rate implies constant net marginal interest costs of holding <b>required</b> <b>reserves.</b> This allows the central bank to change the policy rate also within a reserve maintenance period without inducing a problematic reserve shifting {{on behalf of the}} banks. In the euro area, <b>required</b> <b>reserves</b> are remunerated at an average rate. Therefore, the way in which reserves are remunerated has to be changed in order {{to make use of the}} advantage of a higher flexibility of monetary policy.

40|$|Repayment decisions—how much of {{the loan}} to repay and when to make the payments—directly {{influence}} consumer debt levels. The authors examine how <b>minimum</b> <b>required</b> payment policy and loan information disclosed to consumers influence repayment decisions. They find that though presenting <b>minimum</b> <b>required</b> payment information has {{a negative impact on}} repayment decisions, increasing the <b>minimum</b> <b>required</b> level has a positive effect on repayment for most consumers. Experimental evidence from U. S. consumers shows that consumers’ propensity to pay the <b>minimum</b> <b>required</b> each month moderates these effects; U. K. credit card field data indicates that these effects are also moderated by borrowers’ credit limit and balance due. However, increasing the minimum level is unlikely to completely eliminate the negative effect of presenting minimum payment information. In addition, disclosing supplemental information, such as future interest cost and time needed to repay the loan, does not reduce the negative effects of including minimum payment information and has no substantial positive effect on repayments.
