40|$|Ascorbic acid is a commonly-used food {{additive}} {{permitted in}} prepacked fresh <b>meat</b> <b>preparations.</b> Consequently, {{the addition of}} this antioxidant is subject to a specific packaging authorization. In this survey 180 samples of not prepacked fresh <b>meat</b> <b>preparations</b> have been analyzed in order to evaluate the diffusion of not authorized ascorbic acid additions. The ascorbic acid has been determined by a high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection method, validated according to the European Legislation. Quantifiable concentrations of ascorbic acid (> LOQ = 20. 1 mg · kg- 1) were registered in 33 samples confirming a wide diffusion of not authorized additions. Moreover, low concentrations not attributable to a additives additions were detected in 14 samples. Ascorbic acid sources (tomato) were declared on the label of these samples. Considering that the addition of this food additive is generally considered safe, these low concentrations registered may be useful for the determination of an allowable limit for the ascorbic acid in not prepacked fresh <b>meat</b> <b>preparations...</b>|$|R

40|$|From February to November 2007, chicken <b>meat</b> <b>preparations</b> (n = 656) were sampled at 11 {{processing}} companies across Belgium. All {{samples were}} tested for Campylobacter by enrichment culture and by direct plating according to standard methods. Almost half (48. 02 %) {{of the samples}} were positive for Campylobacter spp. The mean Campylobacter count was 1. 68 log 10 CFU/g {{with a standard deviation}} of ± 0. 64 log 10 CFU/g. The study revealed a statistically significant variation in Campylobacter contamination levels between companies; processors with a wider frequency distribution range of Campylobacter counts provided chicken <b>meat</b> <b>preparations</b> with higher Campylobacter incidences and concentrations. There was no significant difference between the counts of Campylobacter spp. in various preparation types. However, the Campylobacter counts and incidences in chicken wings were the highest and portioned-form products (legs, wings, and breasts) showed a higher probability of being Campylobacter positive compared to minced-form products (sausages, burgers, and minced meat). The proportion of Campylobacter-positive samples was significantly higher in July than in other months. Recovery of Campylobacter spp. recovery by direct plating was higher (41. 0 %) compared to detection after enrichment (24. 2 %). Statistical modeling of the survey data showed that the likelihood of obtaining a positive result by enrichment culture increases with an increase in the Campylobacter concentration in the sample.

High peroxide values were detected in all affected “arrosticini” samples. Histopathological investigations showed the presence of “giant” fibres both in samples of “arrosticini” with evident chromatic changes and in the muscles. These “giant” fibres, positive to ATPase reaction after alkaline pre-incubation and to the Periodic Acid Shiff (PAS) reaction, showed floccular necrosis, sarcoplasm fragmentation and hypercontraction of the fibres. These findings could be related in part to a recurring ischemia in the involved muscular areas that occurred in the living animals, probably due to their fast, excessive growth...|$|R

Todėl iškyla būtinybė kurti naujus – funkcionalesnius maisto produktus, skirtus kasdieniam vartojimui, praturtintus likopenu ir kitais karotinoidais, gautais iš natūralios augalinės žaliavos. Taip pat, kuriant naujus produktus, labai svarbu užtikrinti maisto saugą. Viena iš galimybių - naudoti maisto gamybai pienarūgštes bakterijas, produkuojančias bakteriocinus. Yra žinoma, kad fermentuojant augalinius produktus, didelės molekulinės masės junginiai suskaldomi iki mažesnių, geresnio biologinio prieinamumo junginių, kurių funkcionaliosios savybės yra geresnės. Taip pat fermentacija nulemia biologiškai aktyvių komponentų padidėjimą maisto matricose, tai yra, efektyvesnę gamybą. Darbo tikslas – įvertinti maltos mėsos pusgaminių funkcionaliosios vertės pagerinimo galimybes augaliniais produktais – fermentuotais pomidorų milteliais. 	Darbo uždaviniai: 1. Nustatyti, kaip fermentacijos procesas įtakoja fermentuotų augalinių produktų spalvos koordinates. 2. Įvertinti, kurie mikroorganizmai yra tinkamiausi pomidorų miltelių fermentacijai. 3.

The aim {{of these}} {{study was to}} {{evaluate}} opportunities to improve functional value of minced <b>meat</b> <b>preparations</b> with fermented vegetable products – tomato powder. Objectives: 1. To determine how the fermentation process influences the fermented vegetable products in the color coordinates. 2. To evaluate which microorganisms are the best for the tomato powder fermentation. 3. To determine whether the fermentation process allows {{to increase the amount}} of carotenoids in fermented vegetable products and which micro-organisms affect this process mostly. 4. To investigate whether heat treatment influences the minced <b>meat</b> <b>preparations</b> rheological characteristics: firmness, consistency, homogeneity and viscosity index. 5. To assess supplies of plant products that help to ensure a red heat-treated minced meat color. 6. To identify which vegetable additive is the best to use to improve the functional and sensory characteristics of minced <b>meat</b> <b>preparations.</b> 7. To evaluate the loss of carotenoids in the minced meat after heat treatment. It was found that for the fermentation of the tomato powder, it is better to use starting micro-organisms instead of fermenting with natural self-starters, or to use non-fermented vegetable products; because this fermentation technology enables ones to sharpen the brightness, redness, yellowness, purity and other colors tone products. For the fermentation of the tomato powder, using Lactobacillus sacei starting products is the best way, because in the longer timescale a microbial breakdown – mold – of a product is unnoticed and the substrate of tomato powder is the most favorable environment for these micro-organisms in comparison to spontaneous leaven and Pediococcus pentosaceus (1. 4 x 108 CFU / g). Fermentation is the right way to extract more carotenoids from tomato powder and for this fermentation, Lactobacillus sacei micro-organisms are especially suitable (carotenoids obtained 98. 96 mg/ 100 g). Thermal minced <b>meat</b> <b>preparations</b> processing and the usage of various vegetables additives affect the firmness, consistency, homogeneity and viscosity index of the product. In order to ensure the red color of heat-treated minced <b>meat</b> <b>preparations,</b> they should be produced with 30 % tomato powder, fermented Pediococcus pentosaceus (redness increased 1. 82 NAF), and with 30 % tomato powder, fermented Lactobacillus sacei (redness increased 1. 19 NAF). Pediococcus pentosaceus and Lactobacillus sacei fermentation bacteria added to the semi-makes up till 30 % improve the minced meat functional characteristics (total carotenoids, respectively 12. 08 and 11. 61 mg/ 100 g). Heat treatment of minced meat produces the loss of lycopene: the biggest loss of lycopene observed is in heat-treating when the samples are prepared with 30 % unfermented tomato flour (loss of 50. 00 %); and the lowest losses are observed in heat treatment of minced <b>meat</b> <b>preparations</b> made with natural fermentation bacteria, fermented vegetable additives (both 10 and 30 %); (loss, respectively, 17. 84 and 10. 78 %) ...|$|R
