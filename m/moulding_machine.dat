These channels allow plastic to run along them, so they are referred to as runners. [...] The molten plastic flows through the runner and enters one or more specialised gates and into the cavity geometry to form the desired part.|$|E

The technological process of producing the paper molds has three basic phases: paper pulp preparation, in which water and waste paper are the basic raw materials, the formation of product in tool pulp <b>moulding</b> <b>machines</b> and process drying. The firm "SERVOTEH" from Belgrade has developed various pulp <b>moulding</b> <b>machines</b> for different operating conditions (manual, semiautomatic and automatic operation), different manufacturing capacities and an alternative number of tools.

500|$|Injection {{moulding}} uses a ram or screw-type plunger {{to force}} molten plastic material into a mould cavity; this solidifies into a shape that has conformed to the contour of the mould. It is {{most commonly used}} to process both thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers, with the volume used of the former being considerably higher. Thermoplastics are prevalent due to characteristics which make them highly suitable for injection moulding, such as {{the ease with which}} they may be recycled, their versatility allowing them to be used {{in a wide variety of}} applications, [...] and their ability to soften and flow upon heating. Thermoplastics also have an element of safety over thermosets; if a thermosetting polymer is not ejected from the injection barrel in a timely manner, chemical crosslinking may occur causing the screw and check valves to seize and potentially damaging the injection <b>moulding</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E

Petre had previous experience in using concrete, designing dock walls and sewers as a draughtsman. This knowledge allowed Petre to require innovative methods during construction such as pouring heart walls with concrete and then facing with stone. Mass-produced components were widely used, including curved arches made in a purpose built <b>moulding</b> <b>machine.</b> [...] Fifty men were employed on the site, and in excess of 120,000 cubic ft (3400 m³) of stone, 4,000 cubic ft (110 m³) of concrete, and 90 tons of steel {{were used in the}} construction. After its completion the Cathedral, constructed of concrete sheathed in Oamaru limestone, was widely acclaimed, later causing George Bernard Shaw to describe Petre as a [...] "New Zealand Brunelleschi".|$|E
