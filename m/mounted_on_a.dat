5|$|Radio {{operator}} James Fort {{attempted to}} contact headquarters on the SCR-284 radio <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> jeep by the command post {{and found that}} German martial music jammed the channel. He then used a side-channel and Morse code, hoping the Germans weren't listening, to send a status report to regimental headquarters.|$|E
5|$|The cannon is in a {{compartment}} {{beneath the}} cockpit, <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> load-bearing beam {{attached to the}} cockpit floor and the forward fuselage support structure. The nose is fitted with distinctive twin pitot probes and hinges up for service access.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two sizes}} of dragonlance. The smaller footman's dragonlance is around eight {{feet long and}} {{functions}} as a pole weapon, while the larger mounted dragonlance is around sixteen feet long and most commonly used when <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> dragon.|$|E

5|$|AMiBA was {{initially}} configured as a 7-element interferometer, using 0.576m Cassegrain dishes <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 6m carbon fibre hexapod mount. It {{is located on}} Mauna Loa, Hawaii, and observes at 3mm (86–102GHz) to minimize foreground emission from other, non-thermal sources. The telescope has a retractable shelter, made from seven steel trusses and PVC fabric.|$|E
5|$|All {{the ships}} of this class are built using DMR 249A special grade high-tensile steel, {{produced}} by the state-owned Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL), and carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) materials. The main machinery is raft mounted, and each gear unit and its associated engines are <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> common raft. The diesel engines are license built by Kirloskar under SEMT Pielstick of France. DCNS supplies the noise-suppressing raft-mounted gearbox for CODAD propulsion. Wärtsilä India manufactures the low-vibration diesel alternators to power the on-board electronics.|$|E
5|$|Based on the M-13, the M-30 rocket was {{developed}} in 1942. Its bulbous warhead required it to be fired from a grounded frame, called the M-30 (single frame, four round; later double frame, 8 round), instead of a launch rail <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> truck. In 1944 it {{became the basis for}} the BM-31-12 truck-mounted launcher.|$|E

5|$|HMS Hotspur was {{inspired}} by a series of French coast-defence ships with the ram as their primary weapon. The layout of Glatton was modified with a fixed turret and her freeboard was increased over that of the older ship. The single 12-inch gun was <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> turntable and could pivot at each gun port to maximise its arc of fire. It was nominally capable of firing forward, but this proved to damage the upper deck.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal {{broaching}} machines {{are designed for}} pull broaching, surface broaching, continuous broaching, and rotary broaching. Pull style machines are basically vertical machines laid on the side with a longer stroke. Surface style machines hold the broach stationary while the workpieces are clamped into fixtures that are <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> conveyor system. Continuous style machines {{are similar to the}} surface style machines except adapted for internal broaching.|$|E
5|$|In 1917–18 the 12-pounder AA gun {{mounted on}} the aft {{superstructure}} {{was moved to the}} roof of the forward 9.2-inch gun turret and a fire-control system was installed with a director <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> platform fitted to the foremast. Minotaur was paid off on 5 February 1919, placed on the disposal list in May, put up for sale in March 1920 and sold the following month.|$|E

5|$|Laces, straps, or rivets {{were used}} to affix the crest to the helm, with the join being covered by a circlet of twisted cloth known as a torse or wreath, or by a coronet {{in the case of}} {{high-ranking}} nobles. Torses did not come into regular use in Britain until the 15th century, and are still uncommon on the Continent, where crests are usually depicted as continuing into the mantling. Crests were also sometimes <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> furred cap known as a chapeau, as in the royal crest of England.|$|E
5|$|Mir {{was based}} upon the Salyut series of space {{stations}} previously launched by the Soviet Union (seven Salyut space stations had been launched since 1971), and was mainly serviced by Russian-manned Soyuz spacecraft and Progress cargo ships. The Buran space shuttle was anticipated to visit Mir, but its program was canceled after its first unmanned spaceflight. Visiting US Space Shuttles used an Androgynous Peripheral Attach System docking collar originally designed for Buran, <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> bracket originally designed for use with the American Space Station Freedom.|$|E
5|$|Navenby lost {{many men}} {{during the two}} World Wars. The village war memorial, a rough hewn stone Celtic Cross <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> plinth with a three-stepped base, is in the churchyard of St Peter's. It was {{manufactured}} by Messrs G Maile & Son Ltd {{at a cost of}} £200, and unveiled in April 1921. On it are inscribed the names of the 22casualties from the First World War and the 8 from the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|Produced by the White Motor Company, {{the vehicle}} {{was simply a}} 75mm Pack Howitzer M1 <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{modified}} M3 Half-track. It was first used in combat in the North African Campaign in November 1942. It later served in Italy and France, and possibly in the Pacific. Some were later leased to French forces and the type was used {{as late as the}} First Indochina War in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The {{body for}} coach 17 {{was built in}} 1911, by local firm Shapland and Petter, and <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> steel {{underframe}} constructed by the railway in its own workshops at Pilton. Marginally longer than the earlier coaches, it contained both smoking and non-smoking accommodation for first and third class passengers, {{as well as the}} brake van space.|$|E
5|$|The {{emblem of}} the Order was {{designed}} by Past Supreme Knight James T. Mullen and adopted at the second Supreme Council meeting on May 12, 1883. Shields used by medieval knights served as the inspiration. The emblem consists of a shield <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Formée cross, which is an artistic representation of the cross of Christ. This represents the Catholic identity of the Order.|$|E
