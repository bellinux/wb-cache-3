5000|$|<b>Refrigerated</b> <b>vans</b> (Class I wagons), {{formerly}} known in Germany as T wagons (T = [...] "Thermos") - are insulated covered vans which are either cooled by a cooling medium {{such as water}} or dry ice like conventional <b>refrigerated</b> <b>vans,</b> or are machine-cooled wagons with their own cooling system.|$|R

50|$|Most food is {{transported by}} road {{nowadays}} {{due to the}} shorter journey times. The stock of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>vans</b> owned by railway companies has therefore shrunk considerably.

These wagons are easy to tell apart externally: white <b>vans</b> are normal <b>refrigerated</b> wagons, blue ones with white stripes along the side are machine-cooled refrigerator vans.|$|R

40|$|Pages: 3 (2), 32 - 48, 21 Ref. Banana fruit {{quality and}} acceptability, as {{affected}} by the ripening conditions in three types of ripening rooms commercially used in Sudan, were studied. The banana ripened in the <b>mechanically</b> <b>refrigerated</b> ripening room (20 °C, 90 %- 95 % RH, and 200 ppm ethrel) were of the best quality and acceptability. Banana from the semi-improved ripening room (22 °C- 34 °C and 72 %- 77 % RH) came next, while those ripened in the conventional ripening room (36 °C- 44 °C and 60 %- 67 % RH) were of the least quality and acceptability. Weight loss was highest in banana ripened in the conventional ripening room, followed by those in the semi-improved and the least from banana ripened in the <b>mechanically</b> <b>refrigerated</b> ripening room. Bananas ripened in bunch resulted in higher weight loss compared to those ripened in hands in {{the three types of}} ripening rooms. Khartoum University Pres...|$|R
50|$|For ferry {{services}} with England, covered <b>vans</b> (Gfh), <b>refrigerated</b> <b>vans</b> (Gfkhs) and stake wagons (Rfh), {{all with a}} smaller loading gauge, were built from 1927. They were similar to the rivetted Austauschbau wagons (Class Trier, from 1935: Saarbrücken).|$|R

5000|$|Just {{like the}} broad gauge railways, the [...] narrow gauge lines {{required}} covered vans. However, {{the vast majority}} were louvre vans, {{and as a result}} only one van each was built resembling a typical <b>refrigerated</b> <b>van,</b> and a typical boxvan.|$|R
50|$|As {{early as}} 1923 (thus to start with, not built as Austauschbau versions), four-wheeled, <b>refrigerated</b> <b>vans</b> (Kühlwagen) were built with modern {{insulation}} that, unlike the insulated vans used previously, were also {{suitable for the}} transportation of fish and frozen meat (Class Gk… Berlin).|$|R
50|$|In the mid 1990s National Rail {{decided to}} {{discontinue}} {{the use of}} <b>refrigerated</b> <b>vans,</b> louvred vans, and boxcars on its trains. At the same time, Australia's rail network was being opened up to enable private operators the use of publicly owned railway track.|$|R

50|$|Special wagons for {{specific}} purposes or wagons with special features were already being introduced around 1850 by private companies.

500|$|All wagons {{for public}} traffic had a code name {{that was used}} in telegraphic messages.

5000|$|In the United States, a van {{can also}} {{refer to a}} {{box-shaped}} trailer or semi-trailer used to carry goods. In this case there is a differentiation between a [...] "dry van", used to carry most goods, and a <b>refrigerated</b> <b>van,</b> or reefer, used for cold goods. A railway car used to carry baggage is also called a van.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from these}} factory variants, {{there were a}} {{multitude}} of third-party conversions available, {{some of which were}} offered through Volkswagen dealers. They included, but were not limited to, <b>refrigerated</b> <b>vans,</b> hearses, ambulances, police vans, fire engines and ladder trucks, and camping van conversions by companies other than Westfalia.

5000|$|Eugene O'Keefe, {{a wealthy}} banker, {{purchased}} the Hannath & Hart Brewery in 1862. By 1864, {{one of his}} partners had died, while the other Patrick Cosgrave left to found his own brewery. The business was renamed O'Keefe and Company. It {{was the first to}} produce lager beer in Canada along with the traditional ale and porter. [...] In 1891 the company was incorporated as O'Keefe Brewing Company Limited. In 1911 another new brewery was built with an annual capacity of 500,000 barrels. [...] O'Keefe {{was one of the first}} to use trucks for beer delivery, the first to build a <b>mechanically</b> <b>refrigerated</b> warehouse, and one of the first to advertise extensively.|$|R
50|$|During the 1950s the International Union of Railways {{developed}} a standard design for covered goods wagons. This has 8 ventilation hatches {{and is therefore}} suitable for the transportation of cattle. Since then, European railways have procured covered wagons which at least match the main dimensions of this standard, but otherwise have minor variations. For example, there are wagons with different axle bases or a different number of ventilation hatches. The body is of a mainly wood and steel compound construction. <b>Refrigerated</b> <b>vans</b> were also developed, based on the long, twin-axled types (Gbs and Hbfs).|$|R
50|$|Swing {{doors are}} most {{commonly}} used on tractor trailers (dry <b>vans</b> and <b>refrigerated</b> “reefer” <b>vans),</b> intermodal cargo shipping containers, certain rail cars that carry automobiles, and smaller utility trailers that haul cargo, horses, or other livestock.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{ice cream}} {{distributors}} sell ice cream products from traveling <b>refrigerated</b> <b>vans</b> or carts (commonly {{referred to in}} the US as [...] "ice cream trucks"), sometimes equipped with speakers playing children's music or folk melodies (such as [...] "Turkey in the Straw"). [...] The driver of an ice cream van drives throughout neighborhoods and stops every so often, usually every block. The seller on the ice cream van sells the ice cream through a large window; this window is also where the customer asks for ice cream and pays. [...] Ice cream vans in the United Kingdom make a music box noise rather than actual music.|$|R
50|$|A covered goods wagon or van is {{a railway}} goods wagon which is {{designed}} for the transportation of moisture-susceptible goods and therefore fully enclosed by sides and a fixed roof. They are often referred to simply as covered wagons, {{and this is the}} term used by the International Union of Railways (UIC). Since the introduction of the international classification for goods wagons by the UIC in the 1960s a distinction has been drawn between ordinary and special covered wagons. Other types of wagon, such as <b>refrigerated</b> <b>vans</b> and goods wagons with opening roofs, are closely related to covered wagons from a design point of view.|$|R
