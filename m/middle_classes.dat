5|$|Leeds' {{growth in}} the 19th century led to mass {{migration}} to the city; this resulted {{in many areas of}} the city becoming overcrowded and many new houses being built. The industrial revolution led to the increase in both working and <b>middle</b> <b>classes,</b> leading to the building of many new houses, aimed at both classes. The most common form of housing to be built for the working classes was the 'back to back'. Back to back terrace houses were built in the largely working class districts of Harehills, Holbeck, Hunslet, Beeston and Armley, whilst larger through terrace houses were built for the <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> in Headingley and Kirkstall. Chapeltown developed as an affluent district of Leeds, and boasts many large Victorian villas, however the popularity of outer suburbs such as Roundhay towards the late 20th century brought land values down in Chapeltown and the area fell into decline.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{a working}} class town, {{there was an}} influx of middle class people in the mid-19th century when {{businessmen}} began using Sale as a commuter town. Since then, Sale has had {{a greater proportion of}} middle class residents than the national average. In 1931, 22.7% of Sale's population was middle class compared with 14% in England and Wales, and by 1971, this had increased to 36.3% compared with 24% nationally. Parallel to this increase in the <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> of Sale was the decline of the working class population. In 1931, 20.3% were working class compared with 36% in England and Wales; by 1971, this had decreased to 15.4% in Sale and 26% nationwide. The rest of the population was made up of clerical workers and skilled manual workers.

As a result, both the Roman society and its military became increasingly proletarianised.

5|$|Farming was {{the main}} {{occupation}} in Urmston until the early 19th century, when weaving became {{a significant source of}} employment, although this later declined due to competition from large industry. In 1848, the population was recorded as being 771, with around 80% of the land being farmed. The opening of the Cheshire Lines Railway in 1873 allowed the town to grow as a commuter town: between 1871 and 1901 the population grew by over 650%, from 996 to 6,594. By 1901, farming had virtually died out, and the town became a residence for the <b>middle</b> <b>classes.</b>|$|E

Debate over how the <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> should be defined and measured has been contentious. This article examines recent Russian social science literature on trends {{in the development of}} the <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> since the end of communism, considers problems in defining and measuring the size of the <b>middle</b> <b>class,</b> describes the role assigned to it by the Russian leadership, and looks at factors inhibiting the growth of the <b>middle</b> <b>class.</b> The {{subject of the}} Russian <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> has engaged the attention of scholars and policymakers both inside and outside Russia. Discussion of how the <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> should be defined and measured has been conten-tious.

40|$|Did the US <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> {{benefit from}} the 1990 s {{economic}} boom? Did this halt or reverse a <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> decline from the previous decade or more? Is a shrinking <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> strictly a US phenomenon with domestic causes, or {{is a problem that}} has plagued most of the world economy? This paper will explore these issues. Section II describes previous attempts at defining the <b>middle</b> <b>class.</b> Section III then examines four possible causes of the declining <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> - changing demographic factors, structural economic changes, macroeconomic conditions, and a more Keynesian explanation which depends on the importance of government spending. Section IV describes the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS), which will be used to measure the <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> and to seek the cause of <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> decline in the US and other countries. Section V provides measurements of the <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> for a number of countries using the LIS.

While there is no official definition of the <b>middle</b> <b>class,</b> estimates range from 30 million to approximately 300 million people.

In 1828, Noah Webster published the American Dictionary of the English language {{in an effort to}} establish a norm for speaking and writing American English that was independent from the British standard.
