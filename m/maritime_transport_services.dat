40|$|Maritime {{shipping}} has {{a significant}} role in maritime policies and overall economic development of every maritime country. The fact that 2 / 3 of the total world trade of goods are done by maritime routes and that the sea is the least expensive trade route is enough to see the importance of its existence for every maritime country. The whole world and overall world trade, in maritime and other sectors, are defined by the relationship between supply and demand and prices on the market. Precisely for this reason it is important to well understand these relations and their mutual impacts. Therefore, in order to present the changeable state of shipping markets, in this paper we will use the supply and demand model which is connected to the freight rate i. e. the price of <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> <b>service,</b> which through its influence on the shipper and the shipowner balances the supply and demand.

40|$|The {{global economy}} relies highly on {{international}} trade, {{and the international}} <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> system acts as the lifeblood carrying and transporting materials and goods globally, realizing the economy globalization in an effective and efficient way. However, globalization increases the interdependence and complexity of global supply chains and drives it to be more vulnerable to disruptions. Meanwhile, the international marine transport system is a complex and intertwined system exposed to high risks and decreased safety due to its very accessibility and operational flexibility. Thereby, global supply chains integrated with international maritime transportation systems are inherently vulnerable to various disruptions. Studies of supply chain disruptions particularly quantifying transport related disruption costs are becoming increasingly important. However, research on <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> related supply chain disruptions, in particular, quantifying its disruption costs is under-represented in the transport literature, due largely to the features of supply chain disruptions, {{but also because of}} the complexity of maritime related supply chains. Current research in transportation has tended to concentrate on shippers’ transport mode choice and port selection. In the context of a global market, however, the behaviour of maritime containerised shippers has to be viewed as a complex decision and an integral element of the supply chain management strategy. Those shippers’ transportation choice decisions should be emphasized and studied to reveal their behaviour changes between normal operations and disruption circumstance. This research adds to the paucity work on investigating the <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> related supply chain disruptions and quantifying its disruption costs based on shippers’ maritime transportation choice behaviour. It presents the results of a microanalysis of freight transport choice decisions in an international containerised <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> chain context. The Latent Class Model (LCM) is applied to identify the key service attributes and its preference heterogeneity in maritime transportation and to estimate the marginal values for the quality of <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> with and without a disruption, simultaneously, quantifying the disruption costs through comparing each attribute’s marginal value difference between normal and disruption operations. The Seemingly Unrelated Regression model (SURE) is utilized to explore the sources influencing shippers’ preference heterogeneities. In doing so, we are able to gain an understanding as to where and how much should be invested in order to facilitate recovery {{in the case of a}} disruption based on the view of the maritime participants’ perspectives. The research results confirm freight rate, transit time, reliability, damage rate, and frequency as the key service attributes influencing shippers’ transport choice. They also reveal shippers’ VOT increase by more than four-times, VOR nearly double, and VOD increase about twenty percent if a disruption takes place, and identify shippers’ transport decisions vary with its product, shipment, company and supply chain characteristics no matter with or without a disruption. This research quantifies the costs of supply chain disruption in containerised <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> context for the first time, and its results provide useful industrial implications for <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> chain related parties...|$|R

The changes brought about by Council Regulation 1419 / 2006 generated huge waves in the shipping industry.

The Guidelines on the application of Article 101 TFEU (previously Article 81) to <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> provide some assistance to tramp shipping pool participants needing to determine whether their arrangement is in compliance with competition law rules by conducting a self assessment of their arrangement.

40|$|This {{scientific}} paper {{deals with}} management {{of all parties}} of <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> {{with an emphasis on}} shipowner management for purposes of optimizing ship voyage costs by applying Virtual Arrival of the vessel to the port. Virtual Arrival is a process involving an agreement to reduce a vessel’s speed during voyage due to berth occupancy at ship accommodation at the discharge port. The reduction in speed during voyage will result in reduced fuel consumption, which directly affects shipowner management, namely voyage costs. The proposed algorithm of Virtual Arrival defines interdependence of the parties of the maritime transport process as well as the actions undertaken in the following procedure of the arrival. The algorithm results show the possibility of creating a mutual financial benefit and display profitability of shipowner management and other parties of the Mutual Agreement. Furthermore, the paper analyzes Mutual Effects of the Virtual Arrival to all other represented parties of the maritime transport process...|$|E
40|$|Maritime {{transport}} is by {{its very}} nature an international mode of transport regulated by a large number of international treaties and conventions, most of them negotiated and concluded within the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Members of the international community, including some EU Member States themselves, were initially reluctant to transfer their sovereignty in this field of transport to the Community. However, two main events gradually changed the attitude of the Member States to the Community's competence to regulate this mode of transport. First, the mid- 1980 s impetus to establish an internal market by 1992 placed all modes of transport at the centre of the project. It was not feasible to establish a geographical market, stretching from the Atlantic to the Eastern European countries and from the North Sea to the Mediterranean, where goods, people, services and capital would be able to circulate freely, and in a competitive manner, without the Community seriously addressing transport issues. Thus, unsurprisingly, a number of important legislative proposals affecting the provisions of <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> were adopted and implemented during that period. The second significant factor {{in the development of a}} maritime transport policy was the number of serious marine accidents which took place in the Community's coastal waters during the last 20 years...|$|E
