40|$|In Traditional Indian {{medicine}} several {{plants and}} herbs {{been used to}} treat various disorders. The practices of herbal medicine {{dates back to the}} very earliest periods of known human history. Herbal medicines are generally safe gentle and effective in treating various chronic diseases in which modern medicines fails or not reliable. Therefore some species of viscum album has been used medicinally for various activities. The whole plant is used in medicine as a resolvent and laxative, best regarded in cancer, epilepsy, sterlity, vertigo and depression and mensurational disorders. Viscum album contains oleanolic acid, b-amyrin, <b>mesoinositol,</b> asparagnes, praline and fatty acids (oleic acid) and flavonoids. It has many ethnobotanical uses and is medicinally used in the traditional homeopatheic system...|$|E
40|$|Tissus {{cultures}} of Tecoma stans Juss. cultivated on modified Murashige-Skoog medium (RT-k) were phytochemically analysed {{by means of}} chromatographical methods (PC, TLC). The following products were found as metabolites: phenolic acids - chlorogenics, caffeic, ferulic, vanillic, o-coumaric and sinapic; steroids - β-sitosterol; triterpenes - ursolic and oleanolic acids, α-amyrine; sugars - glucose, fructose, sucrose, xylose. Meso-inositol was isolated in 0. 8 % yield. In intact plant leaves, some differences concerning the content and/or number of individual compounds were observed, namely: lack of sinapic acid and occurrence of p-coumaric acid, lower content of β-sitosterol, lack of oleanolic acid, occurrence of β-amyrine and of one unidentified triterpenoid, lack of xylose, occurrence of maltose, raffinose, and stachiose. The level of <b>mesoinositol</b> inn leaves was distincly lower than in the callus tissues. Neither in callus tissues nor in leaves iridoid glycosides were found...|$|E
40|$|After {{stocking}} of a {{sugar beet}} plant explants on the modificated agarized medium {{according to the}} Murashige & Skoog protocol laced with 1000 mg. ml- 4 <b>mesoinositol,</b> 5 mg. ml- 4 of vitamin B 1, 5 mg. ml- 4 casein hydrolyzate, 10 mg. ml- 4 6 -BAP, 5 mg. ml- 4 NAA, 1 mg. ml- 4 IAA callus formation was observed on the 20 - 23 day. Development of callus culture accompanied by formation of two histochemicaly different zones - peripherical and inner. In the process of further differentiation in the certain sections of inner callus zones small group of cells with high proliferative potential was formed. They initiated formation of meristemoids. Their development synchronized with lignification and deposition of β (1 → 3) -glucan (callose) on external periclinal and anticlinal cell walls of parenchyma peripherical zone. Synthesis and deposition of callose on cell walls regulated {{the intensity of the}} intercellular ion transport and products of metabolism, creating conditions for the formation of biochemical grade in callus tissues. Morphogenic structures with developed conductive system were formed both on the callus surface and middle layers. They had spatial-structural organization in which were meristematic cones, provascular zones with hydrocites system, surrounded by several layers of small parenchymal cells. Each module was surrounded by a large sized parenchymal cells, cell walls of which had significant depositions of callose, lignin and suberins...|$|E
