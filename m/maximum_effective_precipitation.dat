40|$|Abstract: The {{temporal}} and spatial changes of NDVI on the Tibetan Plateau, {{as well as the}} relationship between NDVI and precipitation, were discussed in this paper, by using 8 -km resolution multi-temporal NOAA AVHRR-NDVI data from 1982 to 1999. Monthly maximum NDVI and monthly rainfall were used to analyze the seasonal changes, and annual <b>maximum</b> NDVI, annual <b>effective</b> <b>precipitation</b> and growing season precipitation (from April to August) were used to discuss the interannual changes. The dynamic change of NDVI and the corre-lation coefficients between NDVI and rainfall were computed for each pixel. The results are as follows: (1) The NDVI reached the peak in growing season (from July to September) on the Tibetan Plateau. In the northern and western parts of the plateau, the growing season was very short (about two or three months); but in the southern, vegetation grew almost all the year round. The correlation of monthly maximum NDVI and monthly rainfall varied in different areas. It was weak in the western, northern and southern parts, but strong in the central and eastern parts. (2) The spatial distribution of NDVI interannual dynamic change was different too. The increase areas were mainly distributed in southern Tibet montane shrub-steppe zone, western part of western Sichuan-eastern Tibet montane coniferous forest zone, western par...|$|R
40|$|Models of the rainfall-runoff {{process can}} be {{segregated}} into two classes: those based on input-output (black box) techniques, and those based, directly or indirectly, on the laws of physics. Both approaches have limitations and advantages. In this paper a combined model is described which incorporates an approximate description of the physical process to estimate <b>effective</b> <b>precipitation</b> and uses the input-output estimation procedure of the constrained linear system (CLS) model to relate <b>effective</b> <b>precipitation</b> to runoff. Results are presented which demonstrate that certain problems of poor calibration and prediction encountered with the CLS model are significantly reduced by using estimated <b>effective</b> <b>precipitation</b> in place of actual precipitation. Use of the precipitation preprocessor with the CLS runoff model effectively incorporates nonlinear and time-variant dynamics without the necessity for multiple-parameter vectors and antecedent precipitation thresholds required by the original version of CLS. Additional refinements, including time variability {{of some of the}} parameters, can easily be accommodated in the new formulation...|$|R

A tephra- and radiocarbon-based chronology {{was developed to}} infer the timing of marked paleolimnological changes in Lake Pupuke, Auckland, New Zealand, identified using sedimentology, magnetic susceptibility, grain size and geochemistry (carbon, nitrogen and sulphur concentrations and fluxes, carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes). Variable erosional influx, biomass and benthic REDOX conditions are linked to changing <b>effective</b> <b>precipitation</b> and seasonality within three inferred broad intervals of climatic change: (1) the Last Glacial Coldest Phase (LGCP) of reduced <b>effective</b> <b>precipitation</b> and cooler temperatures, from 28. 8 to 18. 0 cal kyr BP, (2) the Last Glacial Interglacial Transition (LGIT) of increasing <b>effective</b> <b>precipitation</b> and warmer conditions, from 18. 0 to 10. 2 cal kyr BP, and (3) a Holocene interval of high <b>effective</b> <b>precipitation,</b> beginning with a warm period of limited seasonality from 10. 2 cal kyr BP and followed by increasing seasonality from 7. 6 cal kyr BP. The LGCP and LGIT also contain millennial-scale climate events, including the coldest inferred glacial conditions during the LGCP from 27. 8 to 26. 0 and 22. 0 - 19. 0 cal kyr BP, and a climate reversal in the LGIT associated with lower lake level, from 14. 5 to 13. 8 cal kyr BP, coeval with the Antarctic Cold Reversal.

40|$|The thesis arose {{with the}} support of the project "Long-term changes in the regime of {{occurrence}} of extreme drought in Czechia". The drought evaluation was based on 8 weather stations which were chosen according to the length of their measurement. They represent the climate of lower and central positions. Two main aims are followed: quantification of drought severity in calendar units (years, vegetation seasons - months April till September) and determining of most considerable dry spells. Beside two new indices DI and EvaDI the drought severity was also quantified by EDI which is based on the concept of the <b>effective</b> <b>precipitation</b> method proposed by H. R. Buyn a D. A. Wilhite. We paid special attention to the weather station Prague-Klementinum for which we estimated values of daily potential evapotranspiration. We used these estimates together with daily precipitation values for calculation of three other new drought indices EDImod, EDI 2 and EvaDI 2. We determined the most considerable dry spells by using the <b>effective</b> <b>precipitation</b> method. We also tried to identify dry spells which occurred at the same time at all weather stations.

40|$|Bayesian {{designs of}} phase II {{oncology}} trials to select <b>maximum</b> <b>effective</b> dose assuming monotonic dose-response relationship Beibei Guo 1 and Yisheng Li 2 * Background: For many molecularly targeted agents, {{the probability of}} response may be assumed to either increase or increase and then plateau in the tested dose range. Therefore, identifying the <b>maximum</b> <b>effective</b> dose, defined as the lowest dose that achieves a pre-specified target response and beyond which improvement in the response is unlikely, becomes increasingly important. Recently, a class of Bayesian designs for single-arm phase II clinical trials based on hypothesis tests and nonlocal alternative prior densities has been proposed and shown to outperform common Bayesian designs based on posterior credible intervals and common frequentist designs. We extend this and related approaches {{to the design of}} phase II oncology trials, with the goal of identifying the <b>maximum</b> <b>effective</b> dose among a small number of pre-specified doses.

40|$|After {{presenting}} a {{brief review of}} the ductile and brittle modes of ice crushing against a vertical structure, the discussion is focused on estimation of <b>maximum</b> forces (or <b>effective</b> pressure) during continuous brittle crushing by the use of a correlation length parameter and statistical arguments. The <b>maximum</b> <b>effective</b> pressure is found to depend on the average effective pressure on a wide structure, the aspect ratio of structure width to ice thickness and the ratio of ice thickness to correlation length parameter. The plots of <b>maximum</b> <b>effective</b> pressure versus nominal contact area (structure width x ice thickness) show a large scatter, as reported in the literature on ice mechanics. However, the plots of <b>maximum</b> <b>effective</b> pressure versus aspect ratio fall on the same curve without any scatter, indicating its importance in plotting data on effective pressure resulting from continuous brittle crushing...|$|R
40|$|At present, {{the climate}} in {{south-west}} Scandinavia is predominantly controlled by westerlies carrying moist Atlantic air, which forms a {{main source of}} precipitation in all seasons. Past variations in the ratio between <b>precipitation</b> and evaporation (<b>effective</b> <b>precipitation)</b> from terrestrial sites, however, may indicate changes {{in the degree of}} maritime influence. Palaeoclimatic archives in this region are thus ideally situated to study past changes in atmospheric circulation patterns. In this study, multi-proxy comparisons of records from three peat bogs and two lakes are used to reconstruct regional-scale variations of <b>effective</b> <b>precipitation</b> in south-west Sweden during the Late Holocene. The total aeolian sediment influx into two peat bogs is used as a proxy for storm activity. The frequency of storm phases increases strongly after ca 2500 cal yrs BP. Dry conditions occur on a regional scale around 4800 - 4400, 2000 - 1700, 1300 - 1000, 700 - 500 and 300 - 100 cal yrs BP. In addition, a comparison to winter precipitation reconstructed from four Norwegian glaciers shows similar variations during the past ca 2000 years. This indicates that the climate in both regions was controlled by large-scale atmospheric circulation dynamics of the North Atlantic region. The strong variability of <b>effective</b> <b>precipitation</b> and storm activity after ca 2500 cal yrs BP indicates a highly variable climate. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Although the precipitation amount in southeast China is not expected to change greatly as a result of climate change, the precipitation frequency may be altered in the future. We explored the interannual {{variation of}} the Bowen ratio and its affecting mechanisms based on eddy covariance measurements in a subtropical plantation in southeast China during 2003 - 2012. The results indicated that the annual mean Bowen ratio was 0. 35 ± 0. 06, with a range of 0. 29 - 0. 45. The Bowen ratio during the dry season (July-October) positively correlated with the annual Bowen ratio (R(2)  = 0. 85, p< 0. 001).

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by the American Geophysical Union {{and can be}} found at: [URL] examined the relationships between large wood (LW) export and precipitation patterns and intensity by analyzing the data on the annual volume of LW removed from 42 reservoirs and the daily precipitation at or near the reservoir sites. We also calculated the <b>effective</b> <b>precipitation</b> by considering the antecedent precipitation. Both daily and <b>effective</b> <b>precipitation</b> data were used as explanatory variables to explain LW export. The model selection revealed that the precipitation pattern and intensity controlling LW export varied with latitude in the Japanese archipelago. In small watersheds with narrow channel widths and low discharges, mass movements, such as landslides and debris flows, are major factors in the production and transport of LW. In this case, the <b>effective</b> <b>precipitation</b> required to initiate mass movements regulated the LW export and did not vary with the latitude. In intermediate and large watersheds with wide channel widths and high stream discharges, heavy rainfall and subsequent floods regulated buoyant depth, influencing the initiation of LW movement. In southern and central Japan, intense rainfall accompanied by typhoons or localized torrential downpours causes geomorphic disturbances, which introduce abundant pieces of LW into the channels. However, these pieces continue to be removed by repeated rainfall events. Therefore, LW export is supply-limited and potentially produces less LW accumulation. Conversely, in northern Japan, where typhoons and torrential downpours are rare, LW export is transport-limited because LW pieces recruited by bank erosion, tree mortality, and windthrow accumulate and persist on valley floors. These pieces may be easily exported by infrequent flooding...|$|R
