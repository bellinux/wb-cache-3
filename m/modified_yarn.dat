40|$|A {{modified}} {{ring spinning}} technique has been recently developed by incorporating false twisting devices into a conventional ring frame for producing a low torque and soft handle singles yarn. Our previous {{studies showed that}} this technology can be applied for producing coarse modified yarns (7 - 32 Ne) with improved yarn and fabric performance. The present paper extends the work for the production and optimization of modified yarns at a fine yarn count (80 Ne). Compared with the conventional ring spinning system, the modified system presents a different and complicated spinning condition in terms of yarn tension and twist distributions, {{as well as the}} interaction between the false twisting device and conventional ring frame. Therefore, this paper aims to systematically investigate the quantitative relationship between spinning system parameters and physical properties of the fine modified yarns using the combined statistical methods of fractional factorial and response surface methodology. In this paper, potential spinning system parameters are proposed and the significances of their effect on yarn properties are quantitatively evaluated. Then the statistical relationships between the significant system parameters and the properties of fine <b>modified</b> <b>yarn</b> are fully examined and optimized. With these optimum parameters, the fine <b>modified</b> <b>yarn</b> and woven fabric were produced and their properties were assessed and compared with the conventional ones.

40|$|Yarn {{structure}} {{plays an}} important role in determining the properties of spun yarns. Recently, a modified spinning technique has been developed for producing a low torque and soft handle singles yarn by modifying the fiber arrangement in a yarn. Comparative studies revealed that the finer modified yarns possess significantly higher strength and lower hairiness over the conventional yarns of the same twist level, implying a different structure of finer <b>modified</b> <b>yarn.</b> Thus this paper aims to quantitatively study the structures of the finer conventional and modified cotton yarn (80 Ne) produced at the same twist level. Various measuring techniques, namely the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), cross section technique and tracer fiber technique, are adopted to analyze their structural characteristics, including fiber configuration, fiber spatial orientation angle, fiber packing density, yarn surface appearance, and fiber migration behavior. Results showed that finer modified yarns exhibit a smoother surface and much more compact structure with less hairiness. The fibers in the finer <b>modified</b> <b>yarn</b> have a complicated fiber path with relatively lower fiber radial position, larger migration frequency and magnitudes. In addition, it was noted that 73 % of fibers in the finer conventional yarn follow concentric conical helix, which is contrary to those in the coarser conventional yarn. The analyses conducted in this paper provide deep insights into the mechanism of modified spinning technique and evidential explanations on the difference of properties between the finer conventional and modified yarns.

However, conventional low twist ring yarns have very low strength and, thus, cannot be used. In this paper, a modification technique is described for producing singles ring yarns with a low twist and a relatively high strength simultaneously. A false twister was used to increase fiber migration and entanglement in the spinning triangle, leading to a reinforcement of yarn strength. The yarn cross sectional structure, fiber path and yarn surface were examined and yarn tensile and torsional properties were evaluated.

The maximum reduction of 3 - 9 mm long hairiness from Ne 20, Ne 40 to Ne 60 was 42. 6 %, 28. 5 % and 21. 3 %. The coarser yarns received more significant improvement on hairiness.

40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{hairiness}} of worsted wool yarns and how it affects the pilling propensity of knitted wool fabrics. Conventional worsted ring spun yarns were compared with comparable SolospunTM yarns and yarns modified with a hairiness reducing air nozzle in the winding process (JetWind). Measurements of yarn hairiness (S 3) on the Zweigle G 565 hairiness meter showed {{a reduction in the}} S 3 value of approximately 46 % was achieved using SolospunTM ring spinning attachment and a 33 % reduction was achieved using the JetWind process. Interestingly, subsequent evaluation of the pilling performance of fabrics made from the SolospunTM spun yarn and JetWind <b>modified</b> <b>yarn</b> showed a half grade and full grade improvement, respectively over a similar fabric made from conventional ring spun yarns. This result suggested that a relatively large reduction in yarn hairiness was needed to achieve a moderate improvement in fabric pilling, and that the nature of yarn hairiness was also a key factor in influencing fabric pilling propensity. It is postulated that the wrapping of surface hairs by the air vortex in the JetWind process may limit the ability of those surface fibers to form fuzz and reach the critical height required for pill formation. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Yarn {{hairiness}} affects {{not only}} the quality of products, but also the productivity in spinning and weaving. Too much yarn hairiness is undesirable for many end uses {{as well as the}} spinning and post spinning processes. The main aims of this project are to examine the hairiness features of various yarns and to reduce yarn hairiness. The thesis covers five related areas – hairiness assessment, factors affecting yarn hairiness, the hairiness of newly developed yarns, yarn hairiness reduction, and effect of yarn hairiness on the energy consumption in ring spinning. The worsted cashmere, pure wool and wool/cashmere blend yarns were employed to investigate the effect of some fibre parameters on the yarn hairiness. A single exponential distribution of the hair-length was confirmed first, using the data from the Zweigle G 565 Hairiness Meter. A linear relationship was observed between the blend ratio and the hairiness indexes. In particular, the effect of fibre crimp or curvature on yarn hairiness is examined. The theory of yarn hairiness composition was also developed further. The effect of draft ratio and spindle speed on the hairiness of worsted wool yarn was examined next with a factorial experiment design. Several new hairiness indexes, namely the relative hairiness indexes, have been used to explain the results obtained. In the investigation of the hairiness of newly developed yarns, the hairiness of the Compact Spun and Roller-Jet-Spun yarns was examined first. The composition of the yarn hairiness, the hair-length distribution, and the effect of test speed on yarn hairiness were then studied. An important finding is that for both yarns, the predominant hairiness feature is the looped hairs. A comparison of the hairiness of Solospun yarns and the equivalent ring spun wool yarns was undertaken. The hair-length distribution of the Solospun yarn was examined first. The Solospun yarns used had fewer hairs in most hair-length groups and lower variations in hairiness. In addition, the effect of twist level and spindle speed on the hairiness of Solospun and conventional ring spun yarns has also been discussed. A novel approach of reducing yarn hairiness – spinning with a ‘Diagonal’ yarn path was examined next. Both ‘Left Diagonal’ and ‘Right Diagonal’ yarn arrangements were studied. A new finding is that the ‘Right Diagonal’ yarn path leads to reduced hairiness for the Z-twist yarn, while yarn evenness and tenacity are not as sensitive to the <b>modified</b> <b>yarn</b> path. The mechanism of hairiness reduction with the ‘Diagonal’ yarn path has been discussed. The spinning performance of “Right Diagonal” yarn arrangement has also been evaluated. Finally, the effect of yarn hairiness on the energy consumption in ring spinning has been investigated theoretically and experimentally. A theoretical model has been developed, which represents the first attempt at theoretically investigating the influence of yarn hairiness on energy consumption during the winding stage of ring spinning. The experimental results have generally confirmed predictions of this model. Recommendations for further research in this area have also been made in the concluding chapter of this thesis...|$|E

40|$|Single yarns {{have been}} {{impacted}} in a transverse fashion {{so as to}} probe the characteristics of resulting wave development. Longitudinal wave speeds were tracked in efforts to directly measure the yarn tensile stiffness, resulting in {{a slight increase in}} the modulus of Kevlar® KM 2 and Dyneema® SK 76. Additionally, the load developed in AuTx® and Kevlar® KM 2 yarns behind the longitudinal wave front has been recorded, providing additional verification for the Smith relations. Further effort to bolster the Smith equations has been successfully performed via tracking transverse wave speeds in AuTx® yarns over a range of impacting velocities. Additional emphasis has been placed at understanding the transverse wave development around the yarn critical velocity, demonstrating that there is a velocity zone where partial yarn failure is detected. Above the critical velocity, measurement of early time transverse wave speeds also agrees with the Smith solution, though the wave speed quickly reduces in value due to the drop in tensile stresses resulting from filament rupture. Finally, the Smith equations have been simplified and are compared to the Cunniff equation, which bear a striking resemblance. Due to such a resemblance, it is suggested that yarn critical velocity experiments can be performed on trial yarn material, and the effect of <b>modifying</b> <b>yarn</b> mechanical properties is discussed...|$|R

Here pristine soft conductive yarns are continuously produced by a scalable method {{with the use of}} twist-bundle-drawing technique, and are mechanically robust enough to be knitted to a cloth by a commercial cloth knitting machine. Subsequently, the reduced-graphene-oxide-modified conductive yarns covered with a hierarchical structure of MnO 2 nanosheets and a polypyrrole thin film were used to fabricate weavable, knittable and wearable yarn supercapacitors. The resultant <b>modified</b> <b>yarns</b> exhibit specific capacitances as high as 36. 6 mF cm- 1 and 486 mF cm- 2 in aqueous electrolyte (three-electrode cell) or 31 mF cm- 1 and 411 mF cm- 2 in all solid-state two-electrode cell.

40|$|Yarn {{construction}} {{is an important}} attribute in knitting and end use performance of knitwear.

H 577 P ITC 2016 LeeKxxiii, 189 pages :color illustrationsNowadays, textile {{materials}} {{are used as}} clothing {{as well as other}} advanced applications. For an example, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is the main component of acrylic fibers and the main precursor for carbon fibers. Inspired by this concept, various preparation methods were explored to improve the water absorbency of {{textile materials}} and hence widen their applications. PAN, which is the main component of acrylic fibers, was selected to prepare the superabsorbent hydrogel. Facile and versatile electrospinning was employed to fabricate the PAN nanofibers as a nonwoven web. Further oxidative heat treatment was applied to stabilize the structure of PAN nanofibers. This stabilized structure was studied in depth by several characterization methods. The relative rate of three main reactions - dehydrogenation, cyclization and carbonylationwas investigated and revealed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The resultant PAN nanofibers were crosslinked that was confirmed by the gel fraction obtained from soxhlet extraction in DMF and the fiber integrity retained after alkaline hydrolysis. The heated PAN electrospun web was subsequently hydrolyzed in an alkaline solution to produce hydrogel. Oxidative stabilization plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of PAN nanofibers under harsh alkaline hydrolysis condition. The resultant hydrogel with highly interconnected three-dimensional pore network was obtained. Due to the formation of solubilizing groups and porous structure, the obtained hydrogel achieved both remarkable water absorption ratio and rate. The optimized hydrogels absorbed over 100 g/g within 1 min, making them to be useful in drug delivery systems and personal care products. Silk, which is another common natural textile fiber, was modified by in situ polymerization of two monomers acrylamide and sodium acrylate after swelling in 4. 65 M lithium bromide solution. Because of its high swelling degree in LiBr as observed under optical microscope, these two synthetic monomers were able to penetrate into silk yarn. X-ray diffraction suggested the conformational changes of silk in 4. 65 M LiBr, while dissolution test and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed the formation of interpenetrating synthetic polymer network. An interesting ladder structure was observed in between the adjacent filaments of <b>modified</b> silk <b>yarns.</b> These <b>modified</b> silk <b>yarns</b> showed improvement in water absorption and mechanical property in both dry and wet states. The water absorption ratio of silk <b>yarn</b> <b>modified</b> by sodium acrylate achieved 7. 6 g/g that was 9 times higher than that of raw silk <b>yarn.</b> This novel <b>modified</b> silk also showed low cytotoxicity towards skin keratinocytes, being promising in biomedical textiles such as wound dressings and sutures. Moreover, another effective approach to modify silk fiber via environmentally friendly photoredox catalysis was introduced. In this study, the photocatalyst tris(2, 2 '-bipyridyl) dichlororuthenium(II) hexahydrate was employed. This green chemical reaction was able to induce the crosslinking of the tyrosyl in silk protein under visible light at room temperature; meanwhile, it was found to be useful in initiating the polymerization of sodium acrylate. This photocatalyst system is beneficial to silk fiber modification through crosslinking and polymerization. The modified silk fibers displayed enhancement in water absorption that achieved at least 4 times higher than that of the control silk fiber. These modified silks were ready to be woven or knitted into fabrics, having potentials in biomedical textiles like wound dressings and dermal sealants. To conclude, the water absorbency of two common textile materials PAN and silk has been successfully improved via various routes demonstrated in this study. These modification methods can be fully utilized in the textile materials which their applications are hence broadened. Institute of Textiles and ClothingPh.

H 577 P ITC 2016 Huangxxxii, 259 pages :color illustrationsWool apparel {{and other}} textile {{products}} are of high value and {{popularity in the}} market {{all the time because}} of their aesthetic quality and comfort. With the increasing demand of light, thin and comfortable knitted fabrics, it is desirable to have wool yarns in medium to high counts with better yarn evenness, less hairiness, soft handle and reasonable tenacity, etc. By literature review, ring spinning continues to predominate in worsted yarn manufacturing industry because of its high quality of yarns and good flexibility in materials and yarn count. Many modifications have been conducted to enhance the control of fibers in spinning triangle and reduce yarn hairs, but nearly have no improvement on yarn soft handle and evenness. However,over ten years ago, a modified technology on the ring frame was developed by employing a false twisting device and a strand separator, which was named as Nu-torqueTM or low-torque or low-twist spinning. Since then, the technology has evolved in five versions. The low-twist cotton yarns exceed other types of <b>modified</b> ring spun <b>yarns</b> with respect to softer handle, lower residual torque, and outweigh the conventional ring yarns in aspects of higher tenacity, lower hairiness, etc. Previous versions of low-twist worsted yarn technology have produced low-twist worsted yarns in median and coarse count, however, some problems were found such as worse yarn optical evenness, more neps and tight wrapper fibers, as well as lower yarn tenacity, among which, the wrapper fibers give rise to obvious "bar effect" on the dyed knitted wool fabrics. Hence, this thesis is aimed at investigating these problems and exploring possible solutions from both theoretical and practical points of views. The surface structure of 24 Nm low-twist worsted yarns are examined under Microscope Lecia M 165 in details and classified into five types including three kinds of wrapping structures and two kinds of unwrapped structures. In particular, the tightly wrapping structures take up almost 60 % on the low-twist yarns. These tightly wrapping structures not only bring about quite compact yarn structures resulting in harsh handle of yarns and fabrics,but also deteriorate yarn optical evenness resulted from obviously smaller diameters than conventional yarn structures and higher variations. Using high speed camera system, the formation of wrapper fibers on the low-twist yarn surface has been investigated. It is found that the abrasion between yarns or the protruding fiber ends and the upper false-twister or the lower false-twister, the fiber security of yarns in A zone, as well as the false-twisting effects exerted by the two false-twisters, have effects on the wrapper fiber formation; more importantly, the wrapper fibers have roots in the long protruding fiber ends in A zone on the low-twist spinning system, namely, the hairiness of 3 mm and longer of the yarn segment between the spinning triangle and the false-twister. Besides, the bulked yarn segment resulted from excessive twists in A zone is reckoned as the reason for the formation of the curved yarns with tight wrapper fibers. Hypothesizing that the structure of yarn segment in A zone on the low-twist spinning system {{is similar to that of}} ring-spun yarns of a high twist without buckling, a hairiness model of such ring yarns is beneficial to understand the origin of hairiness and wrapper fibers as well as the formation of neps. The number of all fiber ends in the out-most layer of ring-spun yarn cross-section, which are already or have potentials to become hairs, is first defined as maximum hairiness in unit length of yarn. Based on Brown and Ly's work on the number of fiber ends in twist-less fiber assembly, a statistical model of the maximum hairiness of ring yarns has been established by considering yarn twist geometry and the contributing surface layer for hairs. In particular, fiber length, fiber cross-section and the number of fibers have been revised with the consideration of yarn twist. Moreover, Hairiness contribution factor (h 0) is proposed for model development as the ratio of the number of fiber ends having potentials for hairiness and the total number of fiber ends in yarn cross-section. From the developed model, it can be seen that the maximum hairiness of ring yarns, or the number of long protruding fiber ends in A zone of the low-twist spinning system, relates to fiber length distribution, fiber diameter, yarn count, yarn twist,measured hair length etc. Moreover, the present model provides the length of the predicted maximum hairiness, whereas previous related models fail to do so. The verification by experiments demonstrates that the predicted values of 1 mm and longer are in the same order of magnitude as the measured values, which are more accurate than the predicted values from other related models. Whereas, the predicted maximum hairiness of 3 mm and longer, that is, the long protruding fiber ends, is almost 1 ~ 2 order of magnitude higher than the measured S 3 values. Alternatively, there are some other ways to further reduce the number of long protruding fiber ends in A zone, like combining Siro-spinning or Solo-spinning with low-twist spinning, because it is generally believed that surface fiber trapping between the two substrands in Siro-spinning triangle or among several substrands in Solo-spinning triangle contributes to the significant decrease of yarn hairiness. Accordingly, the maximum hairiness model of ring yarns is revised for Siro-spun yarns and Solo-spun yarns with respect to fiber trapping and yarn geometry, respectively. Also, experiments have been carried out to verify the developed hairiness models. As aforementioned before, the fiber security of the yarn segment in A zone also influence the wrapper fiber formation and the resultant yarn surface; and the degree of fiber ends being tucked into yarn bodies directly determines the number of protruding hair of yarns. Whereas, the existing related parameters only describe fiber ends already protruding out of yarns. Similar to the theoretical limit of yarn evenness CVlim, the real yarn hairiness can approach but is always lower than the maximum hairiness of ring yarns. A Relative Hairiness Index (RHI) is accordingly proposed, which has two forms:the theoretical one and the actual one. The theoretical RHI is the ratio of maximum hairiness of certain type of yarn to the maximum hairiness of ring yarns, which can theoretically reveal the effectiveness of different spinning methods in tucking fiber ends into yarn bodies; and the so-called actual RHI is the ratio of the measured yarn hairiness and the maximum hairiness of ring yarns, which can actually demonstrate the degree of fiber ends potential for hairiness being tucked into yarns resulted from various spinning system or their spinning parameters. Both the theoretical RHI and the actual RHI demonstrate that Siro-spinning can most effectively tuck fiber ends into yarn bodies, therefore Siro-spun feeding will give rise to the least long protruding fiber ends. Additionally, winding is employed to mimic the abrasion that yarn will experience, and it is found that the hairiness of ring yarns obviously increases with the increasing winding times and reaches a plateau after the fourth winding, therefore the number of hairs of yarns after four-time winding, is termed as stable hairiness. By analyzing the increment rate of the actual RHI of various yarns in the states of cop, cone and stable, which are the yarns experience zero-time, one-time and four-time winding, respectively, Siro-pun yarns also present the best fiber security. Hence, Siro-spun feeding with a normal roving gap of 14 mm is combined with the lately 5 th version of low-twist spinning system for further reducing the wrapper fibers and improving the surface of low-twist yarns. However, aiming at yarn evenness and tenacity, as well as proper twists in A zone to avoid bulking as described before, the spinning parameters of 36 Nm low-twist yarns (36 LT) is first systematically optimized by means of the combination of Fractional Factorial Methodology and Response Surface Methodology, respectively. With a twist multiplier reduced by around 15 %, the optimized 36 LT yarns show comparable tenacity and similar hairiness, but still a bit worse evenness and more neps than the conventional yarns. Actually, the number of neps (+ 140 %) has been reduced about one order of magnitude on the present low-twist yarns by comparing with that of yarns produced on the previous versions of low-twist spinning system. The blackboard evenness of the optimized 36 LT yarns exhibits half grade lower than the conventional yarns with a twist multiplier higher by about 15 %, but half grade higher than the counterparts with the same level of twist multiplier, respectively. Then, the spinning parameters of 36 Nm low-twist yarns with double-roving feeding (36 LT+Siro) are also optimized by using Response Surface Methodology. The tightly wrapped structures on the optimized 36 LT yarns only account for 8. 9 %, whereas the ones on the optimized 36 LT+Siro yarns even reduce to 5. 8 %. Moreover, nearly no tightly wrapped structures with a curved yarn body are found on the two optimized yarn surfaces. Therefore, the optimized spinning parameters of low-twist spinning system, as well as the incorporation of Siro-spinning not only facilitate the reduction of wrapper fibers on the resultant yarns, but also provide suitable twists in A zone to avoid producing buckling and curved yarn segments. Nevertheless, the optimized 36 LT yarn has an obviously higher actual RHI than the conventional ring yarns, and it presents similar increment rate when enduring abrasion to that of its counterpart, which indicates that the optimized 36 LT yarns possess low fiber tucking and security, in other words, the fiber deformation resulted from false-twisting effect fails to be held in yarns. But the actual RHI of the optimized 36 LT+Siro yarn and its increment rate by abrasion are markedly lower than the ones of the conventional yarn, particularly, its increment rate is even similar to that of Solo-spun yarns. It is demonstrated that the fiber tucking and security of low-twist yarns can also be improved by integrating Siro-spinning system. Finally, using the Kawabata Evaluation System of Fabric (KES-F), the knitted fabrics made of the optimized 36 LT yarns are examined in terms of fabric surface property, tensile and shear, as well as bending and compression. There are no statistically significant differences in surface property,tensile, shear, bending, compression and bursting strength between the low-twist fabrics and the conventional fabrics made of the worsted yarns with a higher twist multiplier by around 15 % (at a significant level of 0. 05). However, the low-twist fabric possesses better pilling performance and air permeability, but lower thermal conductivity than its counterpart. Besides, nearly no "bar effect" is found on the resultant fabrics made of the optimized 36 LT yarns. Institute of Textiles and ClothingPh.
