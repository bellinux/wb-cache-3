He elaborated that the writers [...] "had {{a little bit of}} fun talking about networks meddling in shows – as well as agents trying to control content as when Joan Rivers booted Janeane Garofalo for being funnier than Krusty – and the differences between cable original programming and broadcast programming. But they had the potential they had to make some bold statements about television and how the industry works throughout, and simply didn't." [...] Hughes did, however, like the King of the Hill appearance, which he described as a [...] "fun nod". Further criticism came from the conservative Parents Television Council (PTC), which named The Simpsons the [...] "Worst TV Show of the Week" [...] because [...] "The Ten-Per-Cent Solution" [...] contains [...] "content inappropriate for the Family Hour". The group wrote that the [...] "frank sexual dialogue warranted a TV-14 rating, but the episode was rated TV-PG. Fox network executives surely know that almost nothing that comes out of Joan Rivers’ mouth is rated PG; but they chose to rate the program inappropriately anyway, thus blindsiding parents and children with crude content." [...] PTC cited examples such as Annie saying that every night in his early days, Krusty [...] "had [...] rolling in the aisles, followed by a roll in the hay with me," [...] and that [...] "Today's kids are less sensitive than an Army condom. They see more on TV than <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> on her wedding night. And they don't complain about it for the next 50 years." ...|$|E
2500|$|She was {{a student}} at the Lycée Florent Schmitt in Saint-Cloud. Her mother left the family in 1984, when Marine was 16. Le Pen wrote in her {{autobiography}} that the effect was [...] "the most awful, cruel, crushing of pains of the heart: <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> not love me." [...] Her parents divorced in 1987.|$|E

6000|$|... "Please don't say {{anything}} more," [...] she begged. [...] "I can't--quite bear it just now. You know, you must remember--there is <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> <b>Do</b> {{you think that}} I could leave her to struggle alone?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{asked you}} last night,' said Clennam, 'how you had {{become acquainted with}} <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> <b>Did</b> you ever hear her name before she sent for you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can you be my father?" [...] {{she said}} in a strained, quiet voice. [...] "Oh! glad am I that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> not live to see this hour." ...|$|E
60|$|The news I got on {{reaching}} London was this: <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> {{not understand}} that her daughter was dead, and {{they were waiting for}} me to tell her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Any way,' he said, 'the {{thing is}} right to be <b>done,</b> {{provided}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>does</b> not make an absolute point of my giving it up; and whether she does or not depends a good deal on how you others put it to her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bear in {{mind what}} I have said," [...] he proceeded; [...] "and {{if you want}} to {{understand}} <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>do</b> what I asked you to do a minute since--tell me all about it. How came you to speak to her, to begin with?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There's such a {{difference}} between {{a father and a}} mother, Sir,' said Rob, after faltering for a moment. 'He couldn't hardly believe yet that I was doing to do better--though I know he'd try to but a mother--she always believes what's,' good, Sir; at least I know <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>does,</b> God bless her!' ...|$|R
60|$|During the long, slow {{journey in}} the {{carriage}} {{to the cemetery}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> not raise her veil. It was not until {{she reached out and}} seized my hand, convulsively, that I realized she was still a part of my existence.|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> not {{understand}} my games, {{but my father}} did. He wore bright-coloured socks and carpet slippers when he was indoors--my mother disliked boots in the house--and he would sit down on my little chair and survey the microcosm {{on the floor with}} admirable understanding and sympathy.|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> {{not suffer}} her {{authority}} to pass from her without {{a shadow of}} protest. One night when Miss Murdstone had been developing certain household plans to her brother, of which he signified his approbation, my mother suddenly began to cry, and said {{she thought she might}} have been consulted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not likely. These {{are very}} rich people, {{with a great}} house in Hyde Park regions, and {{a place in the}} country. They are always asking Cecil there; only <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>does</b> not fancy it. It {{is not a matter of}} charity after the first stress. They can easily have advice from England, or {{anywhere}} they like." ...|$|R

60|$|Margaret {{had kept}} things straight. I {{do not know}} how it was, but peace always went away with her; and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> things she never {{attempted}} when the real lady of the house was at home. And yet I might thank my own hasty folly for much of what befell.|$|E
6000|$|The answer comforted me not. It {{remained}} {{clear that}} I was not wanted either in Heaven nor upon the earth. God {{did not want}} me. He was glad {{to get rid of}} me. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> not want me. She could have done without me. Nobody wanted me. Why was I here? ...|$|E
60|$|I {{managed to}} discover, however, that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> not know, and surmised {{that the best}} reason why {{she had not been}} told had to do with Hannah's {{criminal}} acquiescence concerning the operations in the shed. I ran into the front hall and up the stairs, and my mother heard me coming and met me on the landing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Frank, {{the first}} {{question}} of all is--How is <b>my</b> <b>mother?</b> What <b>did</b> she do when I was missing? It must have been awful for her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{extremely}} kind," [...] replied Miss Bates, highly gratified; [...] "you who {{are such a}} judge, and write so beautifully yourself. I am sure there is nobody's praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss Woodhouse's. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>does</b> not hear; she is a little deaf you know. Ma'am," [...] addressing her, [...] "do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging to say about Jane's handwriting?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh! <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> wonders," [...] said Egremont: [...] "we {{should have}} been beat without her. Indeed, to tell the truth, I quite gave up the thing the moment they started their man. Before that we were on velvet; but the instant he {{appeared}} everything was changed, and I found some of my warmest supporters, members of his committee." ...|$|E
6000|$|Pen, with a laugh, said [...] "that at {{one time}} he did think he was pretty well in Miss Amory's good graces. But <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> not like her, and the affair went off." [...] Pen {{did not think it}} fit to tell his uncle all the {{particulars}} of that courtship which had passed between himself and the young lady.|$|E
6000|$|Hapless, hapless, I must be [...] All {{the hours}} of life I see, [...] Since my foolish nurse did once [...] Bed me on her leggen bones; [...] Since <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> not weel [...] To snip my nails with blades of steel. [...] Had they laid me on a pillow [...] In a cot of water willow, [...] Had they bitten finger and thumb, [...] Not to such ill hap I had come.|$|E

"Tarzan," [...] he said, in {{the speech}} of the great apes of the tribe of Kerchak, [...] "do not take me from Momaya, <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> <b>Do</b> not take me again to the lair of the hairy, tree men, for I fear Taug and Gunto and the others. Let me stay with Momaya, O Tarzan, God of the Jungle! Let me stay with Momaya, <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> and {{to the end of}} our days we will bless you and put food before the gates of the village of Mbonga that you may never hunger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [To which ELIZABETH replies, {{though the}} words reach only PHOEBE: [...] "I might have, if I {{had known that}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was <b>doing</b> all the work, while he was {{pocketing}} the fee!"] ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'As <b>my</b> poor <b>mother</b> <b>does!</b> Well, with {{patience}} the snail got to Rome, {{and if it}} is to lighten her load, I must bear it. Many thanks, Mr. Ferrars. Good morning.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> {{not come}} home till the evening, when the streets had become tolerably quiet. She {{had a strange}} account to give, for she {{had been at the}} palace all the time in {{attendance}} on Queen Henrietta, who tried in vain to impress her sister-in-law with a sense that the matter was serious. Queen Anne of Austria was too proud to believe that a parliament and a mob could do any damage to the throne of France, whatever they might effect in England.|$|E
6000|$|... "I entreat my {{kind and}} dear young {{mistress}} not {{to suppose that}} I believe in witchcraft--after such an education as I have received. When I wrote down, at your biding, all that I had told you by word of mouth, I cannot imagine what delusion possessed me. You say I have a negro side to my character, which I inherit from <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> <b>Did</b> you mean this, dear mistress, as a joke? I am almost afraid it is sometimes not far off from the truth.|$|E
60|$|Of {{the table}} that we kept, beyond noting that the fare was ever of a lenten kind and that the wine was watered, I will but mention that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> not observe the barrier of the salt. There was no sitting above it or below at our board, as, from time immemorial, is the {{universal}} custom in feudal homes. That her having abolished {{it was an act}} of humility on her part there can be little doubt, although this was a subject upon which she never expressed herself in my hearing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Daddy," [...] {{said the}} child, [...] "I haven't said <b>my</b> prayers. <b>Mother</b> <b>did</b> not come, and Anne {{said it was}} all {{nonsense}} about prayers. Auntie did always hear me my prayers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{know how}} {{different}} I am. You see me looking on you now, {{and you can}} read the warmth of passion for you that is breathing in my face.' Not a curl of the proud lip, not a flash of the dark eye, nothing but the same intent and searching look, accompanied these words. 'You know my general history. You have spoken of <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> <b>Do</b> you think you can degrade, or bend or break, me to submission and obedience?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O, far rather!" [...] exclaimed Perseus, {{with the}} tears again {{standing}} in his eyes. [...] "And, besides, what would <b>my</b> dear <b>mother</b> <b>do,</b> if her beloved son were turned into a stone?" ...|$|R
