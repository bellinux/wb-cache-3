5|$|Bahá'u'lláh's teachings {{focus on}} the unity of God, religion, and mankind. Similar to other monotheistic religions, God is {{considered}} {{the source of all}} created things. Religion, according to Bahá'u'lláh, is renewed periodically by Manifestations of God, people who are <b>made</b> <b>perfect</b> through divine intervention and whose teachings are the sources of the major world religions throughout history. Bahá'ís view Bahá'u'lláh as the first of these teachers whose mission includes the spiritual unification of the entire planet through the eradication of racism and nationalism. Bahá'u'lláh's teachings include the need for a world tribunal to adjudicate disputes between nations, a uniform system of weights and measures, and an auxiliary language that could be spoken by all the people on earth. Bahá'u'lláh also taught that the cycles of revelatory renewal will continue in the future, with Manifestations of God appearing every thousand years or so.|$|E
25|$|In Dante's fourteenth-century work La divina commedia (The Divine Comedy), Purgatory is {{depicted}} as a mountain in the Southern hemisphere. It is apparently the only land there. Souls who loved God and man half-heartedly find themselves at Mount Purgatory, where there are two levels, then Seven Levels representing the Seven Deadly Sins with ironic punishments. For example, on the first level for Pride, the penitents are weighed down by huge stones. This forces them to look down in humility at the pavement, which depicts examples of sinful Pride such as Arachne. When they reach the top, souls will find themselves at Jerusalem's antipode, the Garden of Eden itself. Thus, cleansed of all sin and <b>made</b> <b>perfect,</b> they wait in this Earthly paradise before ascending to Heaven.|$|E

On 27 July the Teiken Maru was sunk by a mine laid by the Tambor On 3 August, she sighted five cargomen and a {{destroyer}} in Palawan Passage. Three shots at a freighter produced two hits, and one fired at another target missed; Japanese records do not indicate any sinking. On 21 August, she sighted an unescorted convoy of three tankers and five freighters. She fired five torpedoes at a pair of freighters, but scored no hits. Two more sped toward a tanker and produced one explosion but no apparent damage. The next day, she sighted another convoy heading in the opposite direction. Making a submerged attack, Tambor fired five torpedoes at a large freighter. Three <b>made</b> <b>perfect</b> hits amidships but all failed to explode, and she sank no ships. The submarine set sail for Midway, arriving 7 September. She transited through Pearl Harbor on her way to San Francisco, on 20 November for major overhaul.|$|E

Swift performed [...] the song on all venues of her first headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour, which extended from April 2009 to July 2010. During each performance, Swift escorted a silver sparkly dress and black boots and played an acoustic guitar as floral patterns with a moving butterfly were projected on the stage. Alice Fisher of The Observer attended the May 7, 2009 concert at Shepherd's Bush Empire in London and said that while Swift drifted off during the performance, it [...] "clearly <b>made</b> <b>perfect</b> sense to {{the girls in the}} audience."

A further 15 other aircraft were destroyed. 139 Wing reported five B-25s destroyed and five damaged. Some 15 to 20 USAAF bombers were also destroyed. Another source states that 13 Wellingtons were destroyed, as were five Mosquitoes, four Auster and five Avro Ansons from the Tactical Air Forces 2nd Communications Squadron. Three Spitfires were also lost and two damaged. At least one RAF Transport Command Douglas Dakota was destroyed.|$|E

[...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com found Hairspray [...] "reasonably entertaining. But {{do we really need}} to be entertained reasonably?

[...] Zacharek was also displeased with the way Latifah's performance of [...] "I Know Where I've Been" [...] was incorporated into the movie, saying [...] "The filmmakers may believe they're adding an extra layer of seriousness to the material... the inclusion of this big production number only suggests that the filmmakers fear the audience won't get the movie's message unless it's spelled out for them." ...|$|E
500|$|Production Designer Allan Cameron found a {{dormant volcano}} near Erfoud where the entire set for Hamunaptra could be constructed.

You would never think of entering the crater unless you knew what was inside that volcano." [...] A survey of the volcano was conducted so that an accurate model and scale models of the columns and statues could be replicated back at Shepperton Studios, where all of the scenes involving the underground passageways of the City of the Dead were shot. These sets took 16 weeks to build, and included fiberglass columns rigged with special effects for the movie's final scenes. Another large set was constructed in the United Kingdom on the dockyard at Chatham which doubled for the Giza Port on the River Nile. This set was [...] in length and featured [...] "a steam train, an Ajax traction engine, three cranes, an open two-horse carriage, four horse-drawn carts, five dressing horses and grooms, nine pack donkeys and mules, as well as market stalls, Arab-clad vendors and room for 300 costumed extras".|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Raymond Wilson {{published}} a book called Jenner of George Street: Sydney's Soul-Winning Sailor {{in an attempt to}} tell the story of Jenner's life accurately. Jenner's family had been finding it painful to have alternate accounts of Jenner's life circulating around the world, so they gave Wilson all the information he desired. Wilson wrote that Jenner was [...] "eccentric... the very antithesis of the 'wise', 'mighty', and 'noble'," [...] but that his life was therefore a good demonstration of 2 Corinthians 12:9, which states that God's [...] "power is <b>made</b> <b>perfect</b> in weakness." [...] Wilson wrote that Jenner's question of [...] "heaven or hell" [...] was very similar to that of Arthur Stace, another Australian street evangelist who wrote the word [...] "Eternity" [...] on the sidewalks so people would consider where they would be in eternity. Wilson called Jenner a battler and did not recommend that his readers emulate Jenner's evangelistic activities [...] "unless Divinely fitted in a similar way." [...] Wilson wrote that he [...] "travelled and corresponded widely to ascertain the facts of the story" [...] and that he personally verified the accuracy of the information by retrieving first-hand accounts from all of the major figures in Jenner's life. The people Wilson interviewed included Nancy Dixon; Ann and Angus Carruthers, Jenner's daughter and son-in-law; Murray Wilkes; Ian Boyden; Tas McCarthy; Peter Culver; Noel Stanton; and Mary Stares.|$|E

2500|$|But in late 1990, {{while driving}} in Arizona {{en route to}} a show in Las Vegas, Nevada, the group's tour bus crashed, and drummer Andy Galeon was {{critically}} injured, needing more than a year to recover.

2500|$|The sudden {{appearance}} of the English army caught the Norwegians by surprise. [...] Their response was to deploy rapidly [...] in a defensive circle. If the Norwegians were located at Battle Flats, {{there is no good}} explanation as to why they deployed into this formation. However, if they were located {{on the east side of}} the Derwent, the deployment <b>made</b> <b>perfect</b> sense. [...] By the time the bulk of the English army had arrived, the Vikings on the west side were either slain or fleeing across the bridge. The English advance was then delayed by the need to pass through the choke-point presented by the bridge itself. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle has it that a giant Norse axeman (possibly armed with a Dane Axe) blocked the narrow crossing and single-handedly held up the entire English army. The story is that this axeman cut down up to 40 Englishmen and was defeated only when an English soldier floated under the bridge in a half-barrel and thrust his spear through the planks in the bridge, mortally wounding the axeman.|$|E

2500|$|Philip [...] {{possessed a}} playful sense of humour, {{combined}} with a shrewd wit. He considered a cheerful temper to be more Christian than a melancholy one, and carried this spirit into his whole life: [...] "A joyful heart is more easily <b>made</b> <b>perfect</b> than a downcast one." [...] This was the secret of Neri's popularity and of {{his place in the}} folklore of the Roman poor. Many miracles were attributed to him. When his body was examined after death, [...] it was found that two of his ribs had been broken, which was [...] attributed at the time to the expansion of his heart while fervently praying in the catacombs about the year 1545. Benedict XIV, who reorganised the rules for canonization, decided that Philip's enlarged heart was caused by an aneurism. Ponnelle and Bordet, in their 1932 biography St. Philip Neri and the Roman Society of His Times (1515-1595), conclude that it was partly natural and partly supernatural. What is certain is that Philip himself and his penitents associated it with divine love.|$|E
2500|$|One early {{reviewer}} of The Marvelous Land of Oz {{noted that}} some details in the book clearly appeared to be designed for stage production—in particular, [...] "General Jinjur and her soldiers are only shapely chorus girls." [...] Since the stage adaptation of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz had been a huge hit, with two companies still touring the country as the second book was published, the reviewer's suspicion was both natural and accurate: Baum wrote a stage adaptation called The Woggle-Bug that was produced in Chicago the summer of 1905. (The detail of Tip/Ozma's sex change, which can raise a range of psychological speculations in modern readers, <b>made</b> <b>perfect</b> sense in terms of early twentieth-century stage practice, since the juvenile male role of Tip would have been played by an actress {{as a matter of}} course.) The musical score was composed by Frederic Chapin, and Fred Mace played the Woggle-Bug. (Baum had wanted Fred Stone and David Montgomery to reprise their roles as the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman for the second show, but the two refused, fearing typecasting, and the characters were omitted completely from the play.) The play was not successful.|$|E
