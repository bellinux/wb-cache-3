40|$|TNO has {{developed}} a computer program to calculate the light interception of the greenhouse structure using an improved half-perimeter method, taking into account reflections and shadowing. This program is {{used to compare the}} light interception of Venlo and Wide span type greenhouse. Furthermore the influence of artificial lighting on the total light interception is considered. The objective is to minimize the light interception of the greenhouse structure (with and without lighting equipment). The computer program is widely used by greenhouse construction companies and suppliers to improve the light interception of their greenhouses. The theory is also implemented in the Dutch Greenlabel programme, to stimulate energy efficient greenhouses. The program is used to compare several common types of the Venlo greenhouse type. The following parameters are varied: bay width, glass panel width, vent size, gutter type and light intensity level of the lighting system. The total range of light interception is about 7 % (difference between maximum and minimum light interception of the greenhouse including lighting system). The range of the lighting system is 3 % Concluded is that a 4 <b>meter</b> <b>bay</b> width together with 1, 67 meter glass panels is the most favorable Venlo greenhouse type. Integration of the lighting system with the structure can improve the light interception with 0, 7 %...|$|E
40|$|Executive Summary This {{document}} {{is the second}} deliverable in work package 5 of the DiscardLess project. The project is intended {{to contribute to a}} successful implementation of the landing obligation of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy of the EU. The work package 5 addresses how unwanted, unavoidable catches can be handled on-board the fishing vessels i. e. from catch to first sale. The objective of this deliverable is to identify available alternatives and recommend the most applicable solutions for on-board handling of these unwanted, unavoidable catches for four different fleet segments in three case studies. The case studies are North Sea, Bay of Biscay and Northeast Atlantic (Iceland and UK), but the selection of vessels has taken into consideration transferability to other European fleets and areas. Practical and cost efficient solutions are identified, adapted and developed for four different fleet segments based on input from different tasks in the project (1. 4, 5. 1, 6. 1 & 6. 2) and stakeholder interaction. The fleet segments selected are 10 - 15 meter hook & line coastal vessels typically operated in Northeast Atlantic, 18 - 30 meter Danish seine/bottom trawl vessels typically operated in the North Sea and adjacent areas, 34 - 44 <b>meter</b> <b>Bay</b> of Biscay bottom trawlers typically operated by the Spanish fleet and finally 40 - 60 meter fresh-fish bottom trawlers used by most EU offshore fleets. Solutions for sorting, bleeding, cleaning, chilling, pre-processing, storing and other on-board handling are suggested and evaluated based on need, cost and applicability. Some parts of the work include elements of technological innovation, but most rely on exploiting currently available solutions, applying “best practice” technology and knowledge. Recommended solutions are presented on deck-plans (drawings) in order for stakeholders to get a clearer picture of the suggested changes. The work presented in this report focuses on the four previously mentioned fleet types that provide a relatively good cross-section of important EU fleets that are to be heavily affected by the landing obligation. It includes reviewing current setup of on-board handling where discarding is allowed and then identifies solutions applicable for those fleet types under a discard ban. The main challenges are connected to catches of juvenile fish, which cannot be utilised for direct human consumption. A number of alternatives are identified for each fleet segment and the most applicable solutions are discussed and demonstrated in detail e. g. in deck-plans, mas-balance calculations, cost/benefit assessment etc...|$|E

40|$|Groundwater may {{represent}} a significant pathway for nutrients and other dissolved solutes into Florida Bay, especially near the Keys where wastewater disposal practices add large amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus to the subsurface each year. Previously, we suggested that high water column inventories of the tracers 222 Rn and CH 4 may be indicative of groundwater discharge. In this study, we employed mass balance calculations to determine that the total benthic fluxes required to maintain the measured water column tracer inventories were significantly larger than diffusive fluxes and varied between 4. 2 – 5. 6 dpm m 22 min 21 and 5. 8 – 15. 4 nmoles m 22 min 21 for 222 Rn and CH 4, respectively. Independent estimates of the diffusive flux and porewater activities/concentrations allowed us to calculate an advective groundwater velocity, assuming {{that the difference between}} the total benthic flux (given above) and the diffusive flux is driven by seepage-driven porewater advection. These calculated velocities ranged from 0. 2 to 4. 3 cm d 21 for all sites, tracers, and sampling periods, with a best estimate of approximately 1. 7 cm d 21.

40|$|Abstract—Ambiguities in {{effects of}} {{earthquake}} on various structures in all earthquake codes would necessitate more study and research concerning influential factors on dynamic behavior. Previous studies which were done on different features in different buildings {{play a major}} role in the type of response a structure makes to lateral vibrations. Diagnosing each of these irregularities can help structure designers in choosing appropriate setbacks for decreasing possible damages. Therefore vertical setback is one of the irregularity factors in the height of the building where can be seen in skyscrapers and hotels. Previous researches reveal notable changes in the place of these setbacks showing dynamic response of the structure. Consequently analyzing 48 models of concrete frames for 3, 6 and 9 stories heights with three different bays in general shape of a surface decline by height have been constructed in ETABS 2000 software, and then the shape effect of each and every one of these frames in period scale has been discussed. The result of this study reveals that not only mass, stiffness and height but also shape of the frame is influential. For this reason in this paper by studying 48 different models of 3, 6 and 9 floor concrete frames in different setback forms by height according to codes in Iran were designed and their periods which have a great share in the response of the structure to the dynamic strength were taken into account.

The objective {{of the study was}} to define the movements of reef fishes among habitats within and between the Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument (VICRNM), the Virgin Islands National Park (VIIS), and Territorial waters surrounding St. John. In order to better understand species’ habitat utilization patterns among management regimes, we deployed an array of hydroacoustic receivers and acoustically tagged reef fishes. Thirty six receivers were deployed in shallow near-shore bays and across the shelf to depths of approximately 30 m. One hundred eighty four individual fishes were tagged representing 19 species from 10 different families with VEMCO V 9 - 2 L-R 64 K transmitters.

Despite the absence of ship timbers, the location of the site, the uniform fabric of most of the items, and their distribution on the seabed indicated that the assemblage represented a shipwreck. The potted, comprising exclusively coarseware utilitarian vessels, may have served as merchandise containers and/or constituted trade items, while some may have held the crew' s food and drink supply. After conservation and preliminary study of the material, project director George Bass dated the wreck to the late Middle Bronze Age pointing to Middle Minoan as well as Amatolian influences on the pottery. While it is true that none of the Bronze Age analogues constitutes an exact parallel of any of the Sextan Deresi ceramics, later periods do not provide any closer counterparts. Recent excavations have brought to light material that supports a Middle Bronze Age dating and strengthens the case for the possibly Minoan or Minonmizing nature of the pottery. Additionally, recent work ill Eastern Aegean islands substantiates the tradition of colonization and intensive maritime activity by Minors in the region.

There are several sources for nitrogen and agricultural land as well as woodlands are the main cause. Interviews has been with wide range of persons to get a grip of what have been done and what is left to do in the area. The interviews have been divided between municipalities, county administration, the Federation of Swedish Farmers, scientist and farmers. The farmers along with the whole agriculture industry in the Laholm’s bay have put a lot of effort to reduce the nutrients leakage. The efforts have not given any clear results and the nitrogen levels are still the same. Data from small forest rivers and small rivers in agriculture land are showing a much more clear result. Agriculture land is in these measurements showing a slightly decrease in nitrogen levels. Forrest rivers are on the other hand showing an increase. It can be concluded that the efforts to reduce the eutrofication have been partly effective. Stronger regulations for all nutrients leakage source are necessary if eutrofication problems are going to show any significant improvement. It’s important to keep in mind that it’s a slow process that involves that efforts are made in several countries...|$|R

40|$|The {{enormous}} {{damage caused}} by hurricane Ike in the year 2008 has been the main incentive for several structural flood risk reduction plans in the Houston-Galveston Bay area. One {{of them is the}} ’Ike Dike’, a large-scale coastal barrier which closes Galveston Bay to prevent penetration of hurricane surges. A momentum gain for flood risk reduction plans enables opportunities for nature-based or Building-with-Nature (BwN) solutions in the area. However, no structured approach with respect to BwN for flood risk reduction has been followed for Galveston Bay yet. BwN focuses on working with processes of nature, promoting and using habitats and increasing the contribution to ecosystem services and other potential benefits. In order to apply this principle to flood risk reduction, more understanding of the hydrodynamic effect of BwN measures under hurricane forcing is required. The main topic of this research is to explore the opportunities for BwN solutions for flood risk reduction in the Galveston Bay area. This study focuses on two aspects: flood risk and natural value. Thereby, the goal is to create solutions which add value to both aspects. Concerning flood risk, surge and waves are considered key processes because they contribute greatly to damage during hurricane conditions. In this study a conceptual design is made and evaluated by means of a qualitative evaluation and a quantitative evaluation. The qualitative evaluation involves two toolboxes. The quantitative evaluation involves a 2 DH hydrodynamic model. The Galveston Bay system is a large estuary, which is prone to hurricanes and vulnerable to flooding. Important variables that affect surge and waves inside Galveston Bay are fetch, depth, landfall location and hurricane surge at the open coast. Fetch and depth can be influenced by BwN measures. Galveston Bay is a productive ecological system and its most important habitats are wetlands (e. g. salt marshes) and oyster reefs. However, significant erosion of shorelines and wetlands in Galveston Bay as a result of relative sea level rise and insufficient sediment supply has been observed. A BwN solution for flood risk reduction in Galveston Bay can consist of several elements or ’building blocks’: nourishments, wetlands, oyster reefs and an eco-island. Oyster reefs are considered as three-dimensional structures. Moreover, an eco-island is defined as a large island with ecological development and e. g. recreational functions. These building blocks have been identified because they have the potential to reduce flood risk as well as provide natural benefits to the system. In order to qualitatively evaluate these building blocks for Galveston Bay, a framework has been developed. This framework involves two toolboxes and the formulation of a global, conceptual BwN design. The toolboxes emphasize on flood risk and natural value of the building blocks. Simplified one-dimensional calculations, where possible, and qualitative literature are used to formulate the toolboxes. The potential effect of a building block is illustrated by a color classification and a description. The effect on flood risk is assessed for surge and waves. The effect on natural value is assessed for five relevant criteria. The framework has been proved to work well for evaluation of building blocks for Galveston Bay. On the one hand, with respect to surge, the toolbox shows potential for a reduction of several decimeters to a <b>meter</b> in Galveston <b>Bay</b> for emerged nourishments which compartmentalize the Bay by limiting fetch and therefore wind set-up. The eco-island, however, is significantly less effective in surge reduction as water can easily flow around it. Wetlands and oyster reefs are considered not effective for surge reduction in Galveston Bay at all. On the other hand, with respect to waves, wetlands are promising for attenuating waves nearshore. However, wide stretches are required and the quantification of their effect is difficult due to various parameters like vegetation type, stem density and stemstiffness. At the shore, oyster reefs are effective in attenuating waves and reducing erosion as well, although the effect in hurricane conditions requires more investigation. Concluding, the evaluation of the toolboxes shows that most promising flood risk reduction measures are least beneficial to the natural value in Galveston Bay and vice versa. The most effective design according to this qualitative evaluation method is a continuous emerged island that reduces peak water levels close to the western and northwestern shore of the Bay. This can be combined with oyster reefs along the western shore until Texas City and wetlands at the foreshore of the Texas City Levee for wave attenuation and erosion reduction. The qualitative evaluation showed promising solutions for surge reduction. However, quantification has been difficult. Therefore a hydrodynamic 2 DH model has been created that incorporates the complex dynamics of a hurricane, two-dimensional flow mechanisms and the bathymetry of the Bay. This model is used to evaluate the system behavior and surge reduction measures for different hurricanes, with or without Ike Dike. Three hurricanes have been applied: a ’regular’ Ike as reference hurricane, and two shifted Ike tracks in which landfall occurs to the southwest of Galveston. These two shifted hurricanes cause higher storm surge levels in Galveston Bay due to higher surge levels at the open coast and stronger onshore winds in Galveston Bay. The model has been calibrated with measurements of peak water levels during Ike. Although this model is a coarse resolution model with limited simulation time, its performance is acceptable. Simulations show that peak surge levels of 3. 5 - 7 m are expected in the Bay for different storms in the open Bay situation. However, {{in the case of a}} closed Bay (Ike Dike) peak surge levels are limited to 1. 5 - 2. 5 m. Surge measures are evaluated for three different areas of interest: West, Northwest or Houston Shipping Channel (HSC) and Northeast Bay. Outcomes of the model show that peak surge level can be reduced by emerged islands which are as continuous as possible. For an island to be emerged even in the worst simulated hurricane conditions an elevation of 6 m above mean sea level (MSL) is required. In that case, peak surge level reductions with a minimumof 0. 5 mand amaximumof 1 mare expected with emerged islands in theWest and the Northwest (HSC) for different storm tracks in the open Bay situation. The measures in the case with an Ike Dike are generally less effective in reducing peak surge levels. A final, optimized design for surge reduction is defined as the combination of a continuous island forWest and Northwest (HSC), the two most economically valuable areas. This design is presented in Figure 1, along with results for peak water level reduction without Ike Dike. The conclusion can be drawn that various limitations are found with respect to BwN solutions for flood risk reduction in Galveston Bay. Bwn solutions can significantly improve natural conditions in the Bay. However, they cannot eliminate flood risk inGalveston Bay, because a large emerged structurewith a few open passages would reduce peak surge levels at thewestern and northwestern shore by a maximum of 1. 5 m. The presented BwN design is a significant intervention in the system and might have limited benefits for natural value. Furthermore, flood risk reduction of BwN measures highly depends on whether an Ike Dike will be constructed and which storm is considered because the landfall location is highly influential to peak surge levels in the Bay. With respect to waves, oyster reefs and wetlands along the shore are considered to be promising measures as they clearly add value to the natural system, protect the shore and attenuate waves. However, the effect of these measures requires quantification. To reduce flood risk significantly, BwN solutions in Galveston Bay should be constructed alongside of hard flood protection structures.

[...] Humboldt State University, 1980 Although Humboldt Bay was {{considered}} to be a major wintering area for black brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) in the 1890 's, the evidence suggests that since at least 1930 it has not supported a large wintering brant population, but instead serves primarily as a major concentration area for northbound migrants. The majority of birds now bypass California bays during the fall, and the population peaks in the spring. A study to determine present brant populations, behavior, and environmental relationships was conducted at Humboldt Bay, California between 15 January 1975 and 10 June 1978. Findings showed that the first groups of fall migrants arrived at South Humboldt Bay during the third week of October. The fall population peaked at 236 on 7 November 1975, 600 on 1 November 1976, and 220 on 11 November 1977. The present wintering period, involving only low numbers of brant, extended from 15 November to 30 January. Spring migrants began to appear in early February. Recorded peak spring populations on Humboldt Bay ranged from 20, 000 on 16 March 1977 to 37, 500 on 26 March 1975. Principal northward migration occurred between 16 March and 21 April. Eighty-seven percent of brant use was in South Humboldt Bay. A marked decline in the total number of brant-use days was noted on South Bay from over 1, 007, 740 in 1975 to a low of 595, 245 in 1977 - 78, while the overall black brant population count was increasing from 123, 000 to 162, 000. Reasons for the decline are debatable but are concluded to be due primarily to the continued intense human activity on and around the Bay. Stands of eelgrass in the Bay were considered to be more than adequate to sustain the brant present. During the fall and winter, 1 November to 13 January, juveniles comprised 41. 8,percent of the population. This soon changed with the buildup of spring migrants to 15. 6 percent between 23 February and 3 April. As spring migration progressed from 4 April to 23 April, the proportion of juveniles rose to 41. 2 percent. This continued to increase during late spring migration (69. 0 percent), suggesting that adults lead the northward migration, with juveniles lagging behind. Use of specific areas by brant and daily flight activity were influenced by tidal level, food availability, time of day, and human activity, particularly hunting disturbance. Areas affected by human activity were used at lower densities than areas without these disturbances. Brant reacted to open-water hunting activity and, to a lesser extent, non-hunting activity by leaving the Bay and flying to the ocean where little food was available. Brant were particularly susceptible to disturbance by aircraft, especially helicopters; and flights below 300 meters often caused flocks to move to the ocean. Intense clamming activity frequently displaced brant from the tideflats to the ocean. Brant hunting at Humboldt Bay may influence {{a large percentage of the}} total North American Black brant population because the Bay lies at the northern end of the major brant distribution in California and Mexico. Hunting at locations farther south (central California and northern Baja California, Mexico) appears to precondition the brant to various degrees of hunting pressure. This conditioning causes the early spring migrants, primarily adults, to be quite wary of hunting activities. Brant engaged in some type of foraging behavior in the Bay during nearly two-thirds of the daylight hours. The rate was greater in spring (23 February to 21 April) than in fall and winter (1 November to 13 January). Denying the birds an undisturbed place in which to feed during the day could result in a loss of energy and a deterioration in body condition at a time when they need to prepare for northward migration and breeding. Brant were not observed to adjust their habits and feed at night as some other species of geese are known to do. Among other activities, feather maintenance occupied over 20 percent of the diurnal time budget, whereas swimming, flying, sanding, resting, alert behavior, and interacting with other birds occurred less frequently. The 37 - to 40 -day hunting season extended from 14 January to 22 February. An average of 43. 1 hunters, representing 75. 7 percent of the pressure, were afield on each of the last 20 days of the season, and over 44 percent of the pressure occurred in the last 10 days. Timing of arrival of spring migrants, weather, and regulations which restrict open-water hunting to specific days of the week had the greatest effect upon hunting pressure and harvest. The total observed legal hunting harvest in the Humboldt Bay area was 1211 brant in 1976, 368 in 1977, and 1375 in 1978. Over 94 percent of the harvest was in South Bay and more than 91 percent of the hunting mortality occurred in the last 20 days of the season, with over 62 percent in the final 10 days. Illegal kill ranged from 4 to 28. Crippling loss was estimated as 23. 0 cripples per 100 birds killed in 1976, 14. 0 : 100 in 1977, and 12. 0 : 100 in 1978. Most hunters were relatively accurate when reporting cripples lost; this is probably due to the experience of local hunters and the fact that they knew they were being observed. The greatest crippling loss (33. 6 cripples per 100 birds observed killed) resulted from pass-shooters along the Spit and the lowest (10. 9 : 100) occurred among hunters in scull boats. After cripples and estimated unobserved kill are considered, the total estimated hunting mortality at Humboldt Bay was 1579 brant in 1976, 446 in 1977, and 1655 in 1978. The earlier arrival of spring migrants in 1976 and 1978 and periods of storm winds in 1976 and 1978 were thought to be the major factors contributing to the increased estimated harvest then, compared to the kill in 1977. Juveniles comprised 22. 2 percent of the hunting harvest in 1976, 23. 0 percent in 1977, and 17. 9 percent in 1978. Hunting from stilt blinds with decoys was the most successful of the six methods employed on Humboldt Bay, averaging 1. 5 brant per hunter-day. Use of scull boats ranked second in success and second in efficiency. Hunting from island blinds was the most efficient hunting technique used on South Bay, averaging one brant per 3. 1 hunter-hours. Other methods (use of spit and floating blinds and pass-shooting) were relatively unsuccessful in take per hunter-day. Hunters in spit blinds with decoys comprised 63 percent of the hunting effort and averaged 49. 9 percent of the total 3 -year harvest at Humboldt Bay. Management recommendations include: (1) Set aside a portion of South Bay adjacent to the South Spit as a refuge from the beginning of the waterfowl hunting season to 30 April, (2) Continue to limit open-water hunting to Wednesdays, weekends and holidays, (3) Replace stilt blinds with portable floating blinds that are removed after each hunt, (4) Space shore blinds at a minimum interval of 275 meters to meet quality hunting standards, (5) Restrict or regulate pass-shooting from the west side of the South Spit Road, (6) Reinstate the fall brant hunting season once an adequate refuge is provided and brant use is established, (7) Prohibit all aircraft, especially helicopters, from flying below 600 <b>meters</b> over South <b>Bay</b> between 20 October and 30 April, (8) Avoid siltation, pollution, and bottom oyster culture and restrict channel dredging to the minimum necessary, and (9) Continue population and age-ratio counts during the spring to monitor population trends and juvenile survival rates...|$|R
