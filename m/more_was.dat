5|$|The modern {{synthesis}} of the 1930s and 1940s, in which the genetic mechanisms of evolution were incorporated, appeared to refute the hypothesis for good. As <b>more</b> <b>was</b> understood about these mechanisms {{it came to be}} held that there was no naturalistic way in which the newly discovered mechanism of heredity could be far-sighted or have a memory of past trends. Orthogenesis was seen to lie outside the methodological naturalism of the sciences.|$|E
5|$|United States v. <b>More,</b> , <b>was</b> a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court held that it had no {{jurisdiction}} to hear appeals from criminal cases in the circuit courts by writs of error. Relying on the Exceptions Clause, More held that Congress's enumerated grants of appellate jurisdiction to the Court operated as an exercise of Congress's power to eliminate all other forms of appellate jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|After {{the court}} adjourned, St-Calais was held as a {{prisoner}} at Wilton Abbey until his followers in Durham relinquished the castle. Once the castle was back under the king's control, St-Calais was released, and left for Normandy, and no <b>more</b> <b>was</b> heard of his appeal to Rome. Pope Urban II did write to the king in 1089 requesting that St-Calais be restored to his see, but nothing came of it. In Normandy, St-Calais quickly became one of Duke Robert's principal advisors and his chief administrator. On 14 November 1091 he regained the favour of William Rufus, and was restored to his see. Duke Robert had persuaded the king to allow Bishop William's return, perhaps in recognition of a service St-Calais performed for the king by brokering {{the end of a}} siege in Normandy that the king's forces were about to lose. The end of the siege prevented the loss of the castle.|$|E

5|$|By January 1967, Suharto felt {{confident}} that he had removed all significant support for Sukarno within the armed forces, and the MPRS decided to hold another session to impeach Sukarno. On 22 February 1967, Sukarno announced he would resign from the presidency, and on 12 March, the MPRS session stripped him of his remaining power and named Suharto acting president. Sukarno was placed under house arrest in Bogor Palace; little <b>more</b> <b>was</b> heard from him, and he died in June 1970. On 27 March 1968, the MPRS appointed Suharto {{for the first of}} his five-year terms as President.|$|E
5|$|Caldwell {{is perhaps}} best {{known as one of}} the {{principal}} architects of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the first act of its kind in the world, signed into law on January 1, 1970. In drafting A National Policy on the Environment in 1968 as consultant to Senator Henry Jackson, the head of the powerful Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, Caldwell realized that <b>more</b> <b>was</b> needed than a mere a policy statement: an “action-forcing mechanism” would be necessary to secure federal agency compliance with the Act’s requirements. The origin of the requirement for preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) has been attributed to Caldwell, whose testimony at the Senate hearing in April 1969 laid the groundwork for inclusion of provisions requiring an evaluation of the effects of all major federal projects significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. In these “detailed statements,” as they were termed in the Act, all reasonably foreseeable social, economic, and environmental effects of a proposed action and any possible alternatives to it must be identified and assessed before any federal action takes place.|$|E

She also made excursions from the camp, looking for food, and would bring back rats and snakes to Williams. Judy had another group of puppies, of which five survived. One of them was given to the camp Commandant as promised and another puppy was smuggled into the women's camp along with any food that the men could spare. A further puppy was given to the Red Cross in Medan, one <b>more</b> <b>was</b> beaten to death by a drunken guard, and the final one remained in the camp after Judy and Williams left.|$|E

5|$|In September rumours {{were already}} {{circulating}} among the evacuees, and in Gibraltar, {{that the possibility}} of re-evacuating the Gibraltarians once <b>more</b> <b>was</b> being mooted, this time the destination being Jamaica, in the West Indies. After much contention, it was decided to send a party directly from Gibraltar to the island, and 1,093 evacuees left for Jamaica direct, on 9 October, with more following later on. However petitions followed and the demands were met, partly for strategic reasons and the lack of available shipping. The situation at the end of 1940, therefore, was that approximately 2,000 evacuees were in Jamaica and a lesser number in Madeira, with the bulk of around 10,000 housed in the London area.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{evidence of the}} wealth brought by the slave trade there are several significant links to the abolitionists. Bristol's Hannah <b>More</b> <b>was</b> an influential member of the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the African Slave Trade. In the Seven Stars Public House Thomas Clarkson collected evidence for William Wilberforce on the cruelty of the trade in humans. Bristol Cathedral contains several memorials to people active in the abolition cause, including a bust of Robert Southey. John Wesley opposed the trade in humans and in 1774 his sermon at the New Room against slavery was disturbed by explosion. Several plays adopted by the abolitionists were performed at the Bristol Old Vic, including Oroonoko, {{the story of an}} enslaved African and The Padlock, which was praised by Clarkson for its importance to the abolition cause.|$|E
5|$|Late in 1315 or in 1316, Harclay {{was taken}} captive by the Scots, who demanded 2000 marks in ransom. His {{meteoric}} rise {{over the previous}} years had made him some enemies in local society, who now {{took the opportunity to}} spread slanderous rumours about him at court. The king nevertheless helped raise the necessary money to secure Harclay's freedom, but {{for the next few years}} he seems to have been out of royal favour. It was not until 1319 that he once <b>more</b> <b>was</b> appointed sheriff, and at the same time made keeper of Carlisle and Cockermouth castles, and Warden of the West Marches. In 1321 he also received a personal summons to parliament.|$|E

Its almost featureless disc gave no hint what its surface might be like, {{and it was}} only with the development of spectroscopic, radar and ultraviolet observations that more of its secrets were revealed. The first ultraviolet observations were carried out in the 1920s, when Frank E. Ross found that ultraviolet photographs revealed considerable detail that was absent in visible and infrared radiation. He suggested this was due to a dense, yellow lower atmosphere with high cirrus clouds above it.|$|E
5|$|Mihailović was {{the first}} to receive reports of contact between the Germans and Partisans, and passed them on to his British Special Operations Executive liaison officer, Colonel Bill Bailey. When Bailey's report arrived in London on 22 March, it was not taken seriously. Italian {{military}} intelligence also became aware of the talks. Tito himself mentioned the prisoner exchanges to the Comintern in Moscow, but when they realised <b>more</b> <b>was</b> being discussed and demanded an explanation, Tito was taken aback. He responded that he was not getting any external support, and needed to look after the interests of captured Partisans and refugees.|$|E
5|$|<b>More</b> <b>was</b> indicted by the Grand Inquest for the County of Washington, {{during its}} July term, for taking {{unlawful}} fees {{for his services}} as a justice of the peace. The indictment charged More with having taken the fees on July 17 and 24. A capias, returnable at the December 1802 term, was issued. The members of the Inquest included five other D.C. justices of the peace: Daniel Carrol, Daniel Reintzell, Joseph Sprigg Belt, Thomas Corcoran, and Anthony Reintzell. Another member of the Inquest was Thomas Beall, a confirmed Adams appointee who had not received a commission from Jefferson.|$|E

5|$|Opposition to Henry's {{religious}} policies {{was quickly}} suppressed in England. A number of dissenting monks, {{including the first}} Carthusian Martyrs, were executed and many more pilloried. The most prominent resisters included John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, and Sir Thomas More, both of whom refused to take the oath to the King. Neither Henry nor Cromwell sought to have the men executed; rather, they hoped that the two might change their minds and save themselves. Fisher openly rejected Henry as supreme head of the Church, but <b>More</b> <b>was</b> careful to avoid openly breaking the Treason Act, which (unlike later acts) did not forbid mere silence. Both men were subsequently convicted of high treason, however – More on the evidence of a single conversation with Richard Rich, the Solicitor General. Both were duly executed {{in the summer of}} 1535.|$|E
5|$|Pelat {{had been}} a friend of François Mitterrand, then President of France, and at the centre of a scandal {{involving}} French Prime Minister Pierre Bérégovoy. As an investigative judge, Jean-Pierre could not dismiss any information brought to his attention pertaining to the case, especially if it might {{have led to a}} scandal similar to the one implicating an illegal Masonic lodge named Propaganda Due in the 1982 Banco Ambrosiano bank failure in Italy, Jean-Pierre ordered a search of Plantard's home. The search turned up a hoard of false documents, including some proclaiming Plantard the true king of France. Plantard admitted under oath that he had fabricated everything, including Pelat's involvement with the Priory of Sion. Plantard was threatened with legal action by the Pelat family and therefore disappeared to his house in southern France. He was 74 years old at the time. Nothing <b>more</b> <b>was</b> heard of him until he died in Paris on 3 February 2000.|$|E
