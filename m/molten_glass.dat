5|$|According to the Holy Land Handicraft Cooperative Society, the blowing {{technique}} employed is {{the same}} as was used by the ancient Phoenicians, though archaeologists and historians of glass agree that glassblowing was not common until the last few centuries BCE. <b>Molten</b> <b>glass</b> is withdrawn from a furnace on the end of an iron pipe, which is blown into as a metal tool called a kammasha is used to shape the glass. It is returned to the furnace and reshaped by the same process before being detached from the pipe and placed into a cooling chamber.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to carbon fiber, glass can undergo more elongation before it breaks. Thinner filaments can bend further before they break. The viscosity of the <b>molten</b> <b>glass</b> {{is very important}} for manufacturing success. During drawing, the process where the hot glass is pulled to reduce the diameter of the fiber, the viscosity must be relatively low. If it is too high, the fiber will break during drawing. However, if it is too low, the glass will form droplets instead of being drawn out into a fiber.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} damage {{sustained by}} aircraft flying into a {{volcanic ash cloud}} is abrasion to forward-facing surfaces, such as the windshield and leading edges of the wings, and accumulation of ash into surface openings, including engines. Abrasion of windshields and landing lights will reduce visibility forcing pilots to rely on their instruments. However, some instruments may provide incorrect readings as sensors (e.g., pitot tubes) can become blocked with ash. Ingestion of ash into engines causes abrasion damage to compressor fan blades. The ash erodes sharp blades in the compressor, reducing its efficiency. The ash melts in the combustion chamber to form <b>molten</b> <b>glass.</b> The ash then solidifies on turbine blades, blocking air flow and causing the engine to stall.|$|E
40|$|A {{high-temperature}} {{device is}} described which allows wide-angle x-ray scattering experiments (WAXS) of <b>molten</b> <b>glasses</b> in transmission arrangement without parasitic scattering and problems due to chemical reactions.

40|$|The fining {{agents are}} {{substances}} with numerous effects on glass melting. The {{second part of}} our review summarizes both the benefits and disadvantages of fining agents used in the glass industry {{for the purpose of}} degassing glass melts and removing bubbles from <b>molten</b> <b>glasses.</b> Particular attention is paid to the usage of sodium sulphate and also to the chemical and physical factors connected with such phenomena as bubble nucleation and the foaming of glass melts...|$|R
25|$|Water {{is used to}} {{cool the}} furnace, {{compressor}} and unused <b>molten</b> <b>glass.</b> Water use in factories varies widely; {{it can be as}} little as one tonne water used per melted tonne of glass. Of the one tonne, roughly half is evaporated to provide cooling, the rest forms a wastewater stream.|$|E
25|$|The glass {{industry}} provides another significant application for sodium sulfate, as second largest application in Europe. Sodium sulfate {{is used as}} a fining agent, to help remove small air bubbles from <b>molten</b> <b>glass.</b> It fluxes the glass, and prevents scum formation of the glass melt during refining. The {{glass industry}} in Europe has been consuming from 1970 to 2006 a stable 110,000tonnes annually.|$|E
25|$|Glassblowing is a glassforming {{technique}} that involves inflating <b>molten</b> <b>glass</b> into a bubble (or parison), {{with the aid}} of a blowpipe (or blow tube). A person who blows glass is called a glassblower, glassmith, or gaffer. A lampworker (often also called a glassblower or glassworker) manipulates glass with the use of a torch on a smaller scale, such as in producing precision laboratory glassware out of borosilicate glass.|$|E
40|$|Recently, the {{traditional}} ceramic industry has demonstrated {{increased interest in}} obtaining inclusion pigments to stabilize unstable chromophores, such as hematite or cadmium sulfoselenide, at firing temperature and in studying the actions of <b>molten</b> <b>glasses.</b> This present work focuses on a new method for synthesizing hematite-zircon inclusion pigments from an unconventional mixture of precursors. For this purpose, a glassy composition that belongs to the LiO 2 -ZrO 2 -SiO 2 system and that crystallizes into zircon during the calcination step has been chosen...|$|R
40|$|This paper relates {{attempts}} to use square wave voltammetry (SWV) {{for the analysis}} of certain additive in <b>molten</b> silicate <b>glasses.</b> Iron, sulfur, and chromium oxides were investigated; first, individual studies of the compounds allowed us to identify the peak potential for each element at each oxidation state and to correlate the peak currents with e species. Then, with industrial melts, the resulting signal was deconvoluted into single peaks for identification. SWV proved to be a powerful analysis tool in the glass making industry. The glass industry is constantly looking for ways to monitor the composition of <b>molten</b> <b>glasses</b> used in manu-facturing processes as they leave the fusion bath. The tem-perature at that point is between 1100 and 1300 ~ and the glass is therefore a viscous liquid. It contains quantities of polyvalent ionized species at low concentrations (less than 1 % of the mass). These species come from refining agents such as sulfate ions and coloring agents like iron and chromium oxides...|$|R
40|$|This {{proposal}} {{focuses on}} the following basic objectives to generate critical information for the following research Needs: (a) to conduct spectroscopic speciation of uranium compounds in glass forming melts {{as a function of}} the acid-base composition of the glasses and melt temperatures, and to use these data to develop a general thermodynamic model for the dissolution of actinide species in oxidic glass matrices, (b) to build a scientific basis for a new methodology to measure the basicity of glasses via optical spectra of in-situ immobilized actinides and to use this optical basicity as a primary actinide structure indicator for solid glass matrices, (c) to define the local environment of actinides in solid glasses via fluorescence lifetime distribution methods, (d) to correlate the above spectral ''fingerprints'' of actinides in solid and <b>molten</b> <b>glasses</b> with glass stability and the leaching rates of individual actinide species from a glass matrix...|$|R
25|$|To {{increase}} the stiffness of the <b>molten</b> <b>glass,</b> {{which in turn}} facilitates the process of blowing, there was a subtle change {{in the composition of}} glass. With reference to their studies of the ancient glass assemblages from Sepphoris of Israel, Fischer and McCray postulated that the concentration of natron, which acts as flux in glass, is slightly lower in blown vessels than those manufactured by casting. Lower concentration of natron would have allowed the glass to be stiffer for blowing.|$|E
25|$|Mold-blowing was an {{alternative}} glassblowing method that {{came after the}} invention of free-blowing, during {{the first part of}} the second quarter of the 1st century AD. A glob of <b>molten</b> <b>glass</b> is placed on the end of the blowpipe, and is then inflated into a wooden or metal carved mold. In that way, the shape and the texture of the bubble of glass is determined by the design on the interior of the mold rather than the skill of the glassworker.|$|E
25|$|As a novel glass forming {{technique}} {{created in}} the middle of the 1st century BC, glassblowing exploited a working property of glass that was previously unknown to glassworkers, inflation, the expansion of a molten blob of glass by introducing a small amount of air to it. That is based on the liquid structure of glass where the atoms are held together by strong chemical bonds in a disordered and random network, therefore <b>molten</b> <b>glass</b> is viscous enough to be blown and gradually hardens as it loses heat.|$|E
40|$|Recently in the {{traditional}} ceramic industry {{there has been an}} increasing interest in the obtainment of inclusion pigments to stabilize at the firing temperature and towards the actions of <b>molten</b> <b>glasses</b> unstable cromophore such as hematite or cadmium sulphoselenide. This work focuses on a new synthesis of hematite-zircon inclusion pigment obtained from sintering of non-conventional mixture of precursors. To this purpose a glass composition belonging to the Li 2 O-ZrO 2 -SiO 2 system that during the sintering/devetrification steps crystallizes zircon has been chosen. The employment of two different Fe precursors (oxide and goethite) have been also analyzed. Finally, a mechanism of pigment formation is proposed...|$|R
50|$|The {{formation}} of Pele's hair occurs when <b>molten</b> basaltic <b>glass</b> is blowing-out from lava. The strands are created when molten lava is ejected {{into the air}} and form tiny droplets, which elongate perfectly straight. It usually forms in lava fountains, lava cascades, and vigorous lava flows.|$|R
5000|$|Hot, {{softened}} {{glass is}} an electrolytic conductor, and some glass manufacturers keep the <b>glass</b> <b>molten</b> by passing a large current through it.|$|R
25|$|The {{final stage}} was to melt the fritted {{material}} in crucibles {{in a covered}} furnace to give <b>molten</b> <b>glass.</b> The furnace needed to operate at as high a temperature as possible since quick melting {{and the need for}} less flux improved the quality of glass. The change from natron to potash required an increase in melting temperature of about 200Â°C to around 1350Â°C, necessitating a fundamental change in furnace technology and the development of high-temperature ceramics. At this higher temperature, normal clay would react chemically with the glass.|$|E
25|$|An {{outstanding}} {{example of}} the free-blowing technique is the Portland Vase, which is a cameo manufactured during the Roman period. An experiment {{was carried out by}} Gudenrath and Whitehouse with the aim of re-creating the Portland Vase. A full amount of blue glass required for the body of the vase was gathered {{on the end of the}} blowpipe and was subsequently dipped into a pot of hot white glass. Inflation occurred when the glassworker blew the <b>molten</b> <b>glass</b> into a sphere which was then stretched or elongated into a vase with a layer of white glass overlying the blue body.|$|E
25|$|Glassblowing {{involves}} three furnaces. The first, {{which contains}} a crucible of <b>molten</b> <b>glass,</b> is simply {{referred to as}} the furnace. The second is called the glory hole, and is used to reheat a piece in between steps of working with it. The final furnace is called the lehr or annealer, and is used to slowly cool the glass, over a period of a few hours to a few days, {{depending on the size of}} the pieces. This keeps the glass from cracking or shattering due to thermal stress. Historically, all three furnaces were contained in one structure, with a set of progressively cooler chambers for each of the three purposes.|$|E

50|$|Pele's hair {{is a form}} of lava. It {{is named}} after Pele, the Hawaiian goddess of volcanoes. It can be defined as {{volcanic}} glass fibers or thin strands of volcanic glass.

25|$|Float {{glass is}} {{a sheet of}} glass made by {{floating}} <b>molten</b> <b>glass</b> {{on a bed of}} molten metal, typically tin, although lead and various low melting point alloys were used in the past. This method gives the sheet uniform thickness and very flat surfaces. Modern windows are made from float glass. Most float glass is soda-lime glass, but relatively minor quantities of specialty borosilicate and flat panel display glass are also produced using the float glass process. The float glass process is also known as the Pilkington process, named after the British glass manufacturer Pilkington, who pioneered the technique (invented by Sir Alastair Pilkington) in the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|The {{observation}} that old windows are sometimes {{found to be}} thicker at the bottom than at the top is often offered as supporting evidence for the view that glass flows over a timescale of centuries, the assumption being that the glass has exhibited the liquid property of flowing from one shape to another. This assumption is incorrect, as once solidified, glass stops flowing. The reason for the observation {{is that in the}} past, when panes of glass were commonly made by glassblowers, the technique used was to spin <b>molten</b> <b>glass</b> so as to create a round, mostly flat and even plate (the crown glass process, described above). This plate was then cut to fit a window. The pieces were not absolutely flat; the edges of the disk became a different thickness as the glass spun. When installed in a window frame, the glass would be placed with the thicker side down both for the sake of stability and to prevent water accumulating in the lead cames {{at the bottom of the}} window. Occasionally, such glass has been found installed with the thicker side at the top, left or right.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} for glass making during the Roman period is scarce, but by drawing comparisons with the later Islamic and Byzantine periods, {{it is clear}} that glass making was a significant industry. By the end of the Roman period glass was being produced in large quantities contained in tanks situated inside highly specialised furnaces, as the 8-tonne glass slab recovered from Bet She'arim illustrates. These workshops could produce many tonnes of raw glass in a single furnace firing, and although this firing might have taken weeks, a single primary workshop could potentially supply multiple secondary glass working sites. It is therefore thought that raw glass production was centred around {{a relatively small number of}} workshops, where glass was produced on a large scale and then broken into chunks. There is only limited {{evidence for}} local glass making, and only in context of window glass. The development of this large-scale industry is not fully understood, but Pliny's Natural History (36, 194), in addition to evidence for the first use of <b>molten</b> <b>glass</b> in the mid-1st century AD, indicates that furnace technologies experienced marked development during the early-to-mid-1st century AD, in tandem with the expansion of glass production.|$|E
50|$|Cane {{can also}} be {{incorporated}} in larger blown glass work by picking it up on a bubble of <b>molten</b> clear <b>glass.</b> This technique involves the gaffer creating a bubble from <b>molten</b> clear <b>glass</b> while an assistant heats the pattern of cane. When the cane design is fused and at the correct temperature and the bubble is exactly the correct size and temperature, the bubble is rolled over the cane pattern, which sticks to the hot glass. The bubble must be the right size and temperature for the pattern to cover it fully without any gaps or trapping air. Once the canes have been picked up, the bubble can be further heated, blown, and smoothed and shaped on the marver to give whatever final shape the glassblower wishes, with an embedded lacy pattern from the canes. Twisting the object as it is being shaped imparts a spiral shape to the overall pattern.|$|R

25|$|Glass {{container}} manufacture in {{the developed}} world is a mature market business. World demand for flat glass was approximately 52 million tonnes in 2009. The United States, Europe and China account for 75% of demand, with China's consumption having increased from 20% in the early 1990s to 50%. Glass container manufacture is also a geographical business; the product is heavy and large in volume, and the major raw materials (sand, soda ash and limestone) are generally readily available, therefore production facilities need to be located close to their markets. A typical glass furnace holds hundreds of tonnes of <b>molten</b> <b>glass,</b> and so it is simply not practical to shut it down every night, or in fact in any period short of a month. Factories therefore run 24 hours a day 7 days a week. This means that there is little opportunity to either increase or decrease production rates by more than a few percent. New furnaces and forming machines cost {{tens of millions of dollars}} and require at least 18 months of planning. Given this fact, and the fact that there are usually more products than machine lines means that products are sold from stock. The marketing/production challenge is therefore to be able to predict demand both in the short 4- to 12-week term and over the 24- to 48-month-long term. Factories are generally sized to service the requirements of a city; in developed countries there is usually a factory per 1â2 million people. A typical factory will produce 1â3 million containers a day.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} step of the glass-making process, <b>molten</b> <b>glass</b> was {{extracted}} from the pot or tank. The glass blower and his helper used a blowpipe, which was typically [...] to [...] long, to create a bubble of <b>molten</b> <b>glass.</b> The glass blower manipulated the bubble into a cylinder, and removed it from the pot or tank.

500|$|In the United States, {{two systems}} were {{used during the}} 1890s to create <b>molten</b> <b>glass.</b> The older system used a pot furnace, where ceramic pots were heated inside the furnace to melt the batch of {{ingredients}} {{needed to make the}} <b>molten</b> <b>glass.</b> The newer system used a large brick tank that could be operated continuously or by the batch. [...] The Hartford City plant used the tank system, and it was originally the [...] "largest tank window glass factory in the world". [...] The tank had a capacity equivalent to 30 pots, giving the Hartford City plant more than double the capacity of some of the window glass plants built a few years earlier in Ohio.|$|E
40|$|The hot moduli of rupture (HMOR) {{measurements}} {{have been}} performed for the low-cement castable (LCC), the ultra-low cement castable (ULCC), and the no-cement castable (NCC). All castables contained SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 based aggregates (burned fireclay and kaolin). The experimental data points have been described using the model based on the Varshni approach within the temperature region 1000 - 1200 Â°C and by the model based on the Adam-Gibbs theory above 1400 Â°C. A smooth but distinct transition between both temperature regions has been observed. The limits and applicability of the models have been analyzed. At lower temperature the loss of strength of castables was attributed to weakening of bonds most probably in the frontal process zone of cracking. At higher temperature, the liquid phase causes slowing down of the crack propagation by formation of the viscous bridging in the following wake region. And finally, at very high temperatures, the castable behaves as very viscous suspension which can be described using models originally developed for <b>molten</b> <b>glasses...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{technique}} {{can produce}} non-dense ceramic bodies {{which are very}} fragile and must be sintered {{before they can be}} used for most applications, analogous to a wet clay ceramic pot before being fired. A wide variety of different geometries can be formed from the technique, from solid monolithic parts to intricate microscale [...] "scaffolds". To date the most researched application for robocasting is in the production of biologically compatible tissue implants. [...] "Woodpile" [...] stacked lattice structures can be formed quite easily which allow bone and other tissues in the human body to grow and eventually replace the transplant. With various medical scanning techniques the precise shape of the missing tissue was established and input into 3d modelling software and printed. Calcium phosphate glasses and hydroxyapatite have been extensively explored as candidate materials due to their biocompatibility and structural similarity to bone.Other potential applications include the production of specific high surface area structures, such as catalyst beds or fuel cell electrolytes. Advanced metal matrix- and ceramic matrix- load bearing composites can be formed by infiltrating woodpile bodies with <b>molten</b> <b>glasses,</b> alloys or slurries.|$|R
