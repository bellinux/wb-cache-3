500|$|Owing to the {{combination}} of Pink Floyd's partial breakup and Waters' dominance on the project, The Final Cut is sometimes viewed as a de facto Waters solo album. [...] The personal quality assigned to the lyrics are related to Waters' struggle to reconcile his despair at the changing social face of Britain, and also {{the loss of his}} father during the Second World War. [...] Gilmour's guitar solos on [...] "Your Possible Pasts" [...] and [...] "The Fletcher Memorial Home" [...] are, however, sometimes considered the equal of his best work on The Wall. [...] More recent reviews of the album have weighed its importance alongside the band's breakup. [...] Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said [...] "with its anger, emphasis on lyrics, and sonic textures, it's clear that it's the album that Waters intended it to be. [...] And it's equally clear that Pink Floyd couldn't have continued in this direction...", [...] Stylus Magazine wrote: [...] "It's about pursuing something greater even when you have all the <b>money</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could ever want. [...] And either failing or succeeding brilliantly. [...] It's up to you to decide whether this record is a success or a failure, but I'd go with the former every time." [...] Rachel Mann of The Quietus said [...] "flawed though it is, The Final Cut remains a tremendous album" [...] and [...] "still has something fresh to say". [...] Mike Diver of Drowned in Sound was less generous: [...] "Rays of light are few and far between, and even on paper the track titles – including 'The Gunner's Dream' and 'Paranoid Eyes' – suggest an arduous listen. [...] Q Magazine once compiled a top ten list of depressing records, and this was on it. [...] Enough said, I think." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, the <b>money</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{will pay}} for it will produce about fifty cents a year, if you keep it at interest; and of course, {{if you buy a}} chain with the money, you stop all that income." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You have," [...] said Stirling. [...] "As it happens, however, that's in your favor. If you'd shown {{yourself}} a cleverer {{man in this}} matter, it might have {{occurred to me that}} it was Miss Stirling's <b>money</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had your eyes on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Besides," [...] he continued, [...] "it is {{good policy}} {{for us to}} be generous in this case, for Mrs. Gray will pay two thirds of the <b>money.</b> So <b>that</b> <b>you</b> and I, sitting in the coop, as you call it, will have all the {{pleasure}} of the generosity, with only one third of the expense of it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Sit down, gentlemen," [...] cried Grant, {{striking}} {{his hands}} heartily. [...] "Sit down {{all of you}} and {{have a glass of}} wine.
