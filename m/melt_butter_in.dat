25|$|The {{cooking time}} depends {{primarily}} on the equipment being used, the amount of sunlight at the time, and the quantity of food {{that needs to be}} cooked. Air temperature, wind, and latitude also affect performance. Food cooks faster in the two hours before and after the local solar noon than it does in either the early morning or the late afternoon. Large quantities of food, and food in large pieces, take longer to cook. As a result, only general figures can be given for cooking time. With a small solar panel cooker, {{it might be possible to}} <b>melt</b> <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> 15 minutes, to bake cookies in 2 hours, and to cook rice for four people in 4 hours. With a high performing parabolic solar cooker, you may be able to grill a steak in minutes. However, depending on local conditions and the solar cooker type, these projects could take half as long, or twice as long.|$|E

50|$|Liquid batter is also {{prepared}} {{with and without}} yeast. Pancakes (qoymaq) are made from unleavened batter using wheat flour. Bliny-style pancakes are made from yeast batter using different types of flour (oats, peas, buckwheat, millet, wheat, or mixed). Yeast-batter qoymaq is thicker than the Russian bliny. It is usually served for breakfast, accompanied by <b>melted</b> <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> a small dish.|$|R
50|$|Beurre fondue is a food {{prepared}} by <b>melting</b> <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> water. The preparation serves {{to maintain the}} butter as an emulsified and creamy concoction. Beurre fondue is used by chefs {{because it has a}} lesser feel of greasiness on the palate, and the sauce is also easy for chefs to use compared to whole butter. Its uses are myriad, such as for braising and basting meats, poaching seafood such as lobster, cooking vegetables, and adding flavor to various foods and dishes.|$|R

50|$|These {{mushrooms}} are popular food item when sauteed <b>in</b> <b>melted</b> <b>butter.</b> <b>In</b> {{central and eastern}} European countries this mushroom is usually prepared similarly to a cutlet. It is usually run through egg and breadcrumbs and then fried in a pan with some oil or butter. Served with white bread, it makes a delicious meal during summer and early fall. A savory Slovak recipe is to bake caps stuffed with ground pork, oregano, and garlic. Italians and Austrians also serve the young, still spherical caps stuffed with seasoned minced beef, baked {{in the same manner}} as stuffed peppers.|$|R
50|$|Agnolotti are {{prepared}} by immersion in boiling water. Typically, they {{are dressed in}} a beef broth and a little <b>melted</b> <b>butter</b> or <b>in</b> a fresh sage and <b>melted</b> <b>butter</b> sauce, as a complex sauce would detract from the flavours in the agnolotti pockets. In both cases topped with Parmigiano Reggiano cheese but no cheese resides in the agnolotti. The dish is associated with Piedmont in Italy and {{is not to be}} confused with Piacenza's stuffed pasta pockets called 'Anolini'.|$|R
2500|$|Tea tree oil {{has been}} {{promoted}} {{as a treatment for}} head lice; however, evidence of its effectiveness is weak. A 2012 review of head lice treatment recommended against the use of tea tree oil for children because it could cause skin irritation or allergic reactions, because of contraindications, and {{because of a lack of}} knowledge about the oil's safety and effectiveness. Other home remedies such as putting vinegar, isopropyl alcohol, olive oil, mayonnaise, or <b>melted</b> <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> the hair have been partially disproven, The use of plastic bags may be dangerous. [...] Similarly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that swimming has no effect on treating lice, and can in fact harm the treatment by commercial products. Ethanol (ethyl alcohol, common alcohol) is toxic to arthropods including lice and an external application of it is harmless to humans.|$|R

60|$|This I {{would not}} hear of, {{so he took}} the top, and I faced him. It was a nice little dinner,--seemed to me then a very Lord Mayor's Feast,--and it {{acquired}} additional relish from being eaten under those independent circumstances, with no old people by, and with London all around us. This again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the banquet off; for while the table was, as Mr. Pumblechook might have said, the lap of luxury,--being entirely furnished forth from the coffee-house,--the circumjacent region of sitting-room was of a comparatively pastureless and shifty character; imposing on the waiter the wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor (where he fell over them), the <b>melted</b> <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> the arm-chair, the bread on the bookshelves, the cheese in the coal-scuttle, and the boiled fowl into my bed in the next room,--where I found much of its parsley and <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> a state of congelation when I retired for the night. All this made the feast delightful, and when the waiter was not there to watch me, my pleasure was without alloy.|$|R

40|$|Summary. <b>Melted</b> <b>butter</b> is {{made from}} dairy butter by {{rendering}} the fat phase. It has specific taste and aroma, high-calorie content and good assimilability. Defects of butter which appeared during the storage causes {{by the development of}} microbiological processes or by the chemical oxidation. On the development of these processes influence quality and composition of fresh butter, its physical structure, content of the increased amount of gas phase and content of heavy metals, storage conditions. Microbiological spoilage of butter occurs generally due to damage of plasma which is good environment for the development of microorganisms. Defects of microbiological origin include: unclean, sour, moldy, yeasty, cheesy, bitter taste. Defects of test and smell chemical origin are formed due to hydrolytic digestion of lipids. It's prevailed at long storage of <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> the conditions of freezing temperatures. It's picked out the following main processes of spoiling: souring, acidifying and sallowness. Often these processes take place simultaneously. It has been investigated <b>melted</b> <b>butter</b> with lactated additive. The latter improves the microbiological and toxicological safety, prolongs the storage condition of the products. Technological efficiency of the additives is achieved by a multilayer products formation from the inactive bound water, preventing microorganisms growth and by the barrier layer with lactate inhibiting hydrolytic reactions. Oil samples were obtained with the batch-type butter maker application, then they were melted and after that lactated additive were supplemented. It has been studied organoleptic and physico-chemical indices of the <b>melted</b> <b>butter</b> samples. The fatty-acid composition of <b>melted</b> <b>butter</b> were studied. Comparative analysis of fatty-acid composition of cow's milk fat and produced <b>melted</b> <b>butter</b> has shown their similarity. Also in the last sample there is increased weight fraction of linoleic and linolenic acids. The obtained experimental data for <b>melted</b> <b>butter</b> allow to conclude about its high quality...|$|R
