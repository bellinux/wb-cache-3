All these methods are very efficient and economical for the biodiesel wastewater cleaning, but they produce a large amount of low-density sludge (Suehara et al. 2005). The biodiesel wastewaters can also be used as a source of carbon for the oil-degrading yeast to produce hydrogen and ethanol (Nishiro and Nakashimada 2007) or as a carbon source for bioreactors treating acid mine drainage (Zamzow et al. 2007).|$|E

Techniques such as pulsed field gel electrophoresis of chromosomal DNA, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based methods have recently been employed in studying the microbiology of wine making.

From technological point of view, this circumstance is unfavorable. It was shown that oscillations can be removed by employing automatic control with continuous P or PI controllers. Moreover, the use of a controller with integrating element causes removal of the predator from the bioreactor. The paper discusses an application of this phenomenon for practical purposes...|$|E

This report deals with a general view of biogas in developing countries and treat to compare different kind of design plants in developing countries with a practical case in India. The thesis contains study of <b>microbiological</b> <b>process</b> and {{the selection of a}} particular design or model of biogas plants with advantages and disadvantages of each kind. The thesis’ objectives are to study the different kind of biogas plants in developing countries with particular emphasis in India and China. The <b>microbiological</b> <b>process,</b> social and economic aspects have been included in the study in order to look for the appropriate technology in each practical case. Other objective is to study the structural development of the socially / economically marginal groups in developing countries with the application of biogas like sustainable energy. The structural development will at least include the long-term accessibility to basic needs and the reduction of inequalities and dependence at an individual and village level. For this reason, it is really important to find the adequate and profitable design of biogas plant. This thesis follows the ordinary methodology. First of all, we started with literature review in order to look for information in the library of SLU and in scientific websides. Secondly, we did a study visit in order to consult the biogas plant in Uppsala. Finally, we had some interviews and discussion with experts about biogas in the Department of Microbiology and Agricultural Engineering. The results of the thesis are a complete review about biogas in developing countries. In this review we compared the different kind of biogas plants with their social and economics aspects. Also, we have studied about the <b>microbiological</b> <b>process</b> of biogas and how we can design the digestors, in order to look for the highest efficiency for the families with low cost. The main conclusion of this report is there is no unique answer and we realized that there is no global solution, because each case is different in every country, location or climate. A deep study is necessary if we want to get good results and {{improve the quality of life}} of population who live with basic needs. Biogas is expensive for poor people, we have tried to look for the way in order to do a biogas plant profitable and sustainable. Development of biogas technology is a vital component of alternative rural energy programmes in India, whose potential is yet to be exploited. A concerted effort is required by all if this has to be realized. The technology will find ready use in domestic, farming and small-scale industrial applications. The diminishing agricultural land may hamper biogas energy development but appropriate technological and resource management techniques will offset the effects. We have proved in this thesis that India or China has their particular style in order to design, build or use the biogas plants, because their necessities are totaly different.

30|$|Thus, {{a limited}} supply of natural AA sources {{dictated}} necessity to develop microbiological AA production. At present, fermentation processes for AA synthesis {{with the use}} of Mortierella fungi are claimed with patents in Europe, China, Japan, and United States [1],[8]-[10]. In the industrial AA production, carbohydrates are usually used as carbon substrates. However, high production cost of the AA-containing microbial lipids determined increased interest in the application of novel inexpensive and renewable carbon substrates. In recent years, glycerol and especially raw glycerol, which is formed in large amounts as a by-product of biodiesel production, had been considered as promising substrates for <b>microbiological</b> <b>processes</b> [11]-[16]. A current price of biodiesel-derived glycerol ranges from US $ 0.06 to $ 0.11 per pound that indicates the potentiality of its application for <b>microbiological</b> <b>processes</b> [17]. It was shown that Mortierella fungi were able to produce AA from pure glycerol [18],[19].

Biochemical tests as well as 16 S rRNA gene study performed. The molecular technique targeting of the 16 S in the sludge of the wastewater treatment plants were examined.

30|$|There {{are several}} methods to treat AnPOME {{including}} membrane separation, advanced oxidation processes, ozonation, sonication, adsorption, ion exchange, coagulation/flocculation and biological treatment. Each treatment has their {{advantages and disadvantages}} (Zahrim 2014). Owing to the large volume of palm oil mill effluent, the treatment will be more efficient if the effluent loading rate can be reduced by recycling it as a substrate for the composting process and direct irrigation (Palaniappan 1993). Although, direct irrigation has the lowest operational cost, there is potential for leaching of nutrients into the soil {{over a long period}} of time, which could lead to an imbalance of nutrients for plant uptake (Palaniappan 1993). Composting is defined as an aerobic <b>microbiological</b> <b>process</b> that converts the organic substances of wastes into stabilized humus and less complex compounds (Xiao et al. 2009).

30|$|Microbiological {{control of}} the process {{could also be used}} to prevent {{methanol}} formation in fermented beverages. For instance, pure culture inoculation using commercial yeast as opposed to spontaneous inoculation by wild yeasts should be practiced. The traditional fermentation processes could also be scaled-up using well characterized and purified starter culture. For instance, starter cultures have been successfully used to produce pito, a traditionally fermented alcoholic beverage produced from maize or sorghum (Orji et al. 2003). Adequate equipment with process controls should be used for fermentation and distillation as opposed to rudimentary equipment lacking controls, which are currently used. For instance, sterilization/boiling at temperatures higher than 80  °C could prevent the production of methanol (Chaiyasut et al. 2013; Amaral et al. 2005). Moreover, standard <b>microbiological</b> <b>process</b> controls and working under aseptic conditions could control contaminating wild yeasts in the fermentation process. Jespersen (2003) also recommended improved process control of fermentation and product characterization including the use of purified starter cultures with appropriate technology.|$|E

Molecular surveys targeting the amoA gene showed that only ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) exist and have potential activity in this special environment.

Phylogenetic analysis indicated that 72 – 89 % of the total screened AOA clones were affiliated with those found in underground water, and 10 – 24 % of the AOA clones were related {{to those found in}} marine water or sediments.
