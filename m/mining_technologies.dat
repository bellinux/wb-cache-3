25|$|Another {{difference}} was geographic distance; although China and Europe had comparable <b>mining</b> <b>technologies,</b> the distances between the economically developed regions and coal deposits were vastly different. The largest coal deposits in China {{are located in}} the northwest, within reach of the Chinese industrial core during the Northern Song. During the 11th century, China developed sophisticated technologies to extract and use coal for energy, leading to soaring iron production. The southward population shift between the 12th and 14th centuries resulted in new centers of Chinese industry far from the major coal deposits. Some small coal deposits were available locally, though their use was sometimes hampered by government regulations. In contrast, Britain contained some of the largest coal deposits in Europe.|$|E
