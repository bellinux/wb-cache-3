40|$|This thesis {{develops}} a general parameterized model that facilitates {{the comparison of}} different file organization techniques for a given <b>multiple</b> <b>key</b> information <b>retrieval</b> system. The model is based on minimizing the expected pro-cessing time of the data base in performing on-line retrieval and updating operations. The decision rules are {{a function of the}} relevant characteristics of the data base, the on-line queries, the storage devices, and the file organization tech-niques, as well as the relative breakdown of the processing requests between retrievals and various types of updating operations. To demonstrate the use of the model, detailed timing formulas are developed for the retrieval and updating opera-tions for three different file organizations: the Multilist system, the Inverted Index system, and the Cellular Seria...|$|R

40|$|Abastract: Many {{authenticated}} <b>multiple</b> <b>key</b> exchange protocols {{were published}} in recent years. In 2008, Lee et al. presented an authenticated <b>multiple</b> <b>key</b> exchange protocol based on bilinear pairings. However, Vo et al. demonstrated an impersonation attack on the protocol, and it failed to provide authenticity and perfect forward secrecy as they had claimed. Later, Vo et al. proposed their enhancement protocol conforming which conforms to all desirable security properties. But, Vo's protocol required any party had held the public key each other, which required {{a large amount of}} storage. In this paper, we propose two new authenticated <b>multiple</b> <b>key</b> exchange protocols based on Lee's protocol, and makes them immune against Vo et al. 's attacks.

40|$|Abstract—Shannon theoretic {{secret key}} {{generation}} by several parties is considered for models {{in which a}} secure noisy channel with multiple input and output terminals and a public noiseless channel of unlimited capacity are available for accomplishing this goal. The secret key is generated {{for a set of}} terminals of the noisy channel, with the remaining terminals (if any) cooperating in this task through their public communication. Single-letter lower and upper bounds for secrecy capacities are obtained when secrecy is required from an eavesdropper that observes only the public com-munication and perhaps also a set of terminals disjoint from. These bounds coincide in special cases, but not in general. We also consider models in which different sets of terminals share <b>multiple</b> <b>keys,</b> one for the terminals in each set with secrecy required from the eavesdropper {{as well as from the}} terminals not in this set. Par-tial results include showing links among the associated secrecy ca-pacity region for <b>multiple</b> <b>keys,</b> the transmission capacity region of the multiple access channel defined by the secure noisy channel, and achievable rates for a single secret key for all the terminals.
