40|$|Aims: Although {{postpartum}} depression (PPD) negatively affects {{the quality of}} mother-infant attachment, {{little is known about}} the long term effects of depression on <b>maternal</b> attachment <b>quality.</b> This longitudinal follow-up study examined relationships between previous distress at childbirth, current depressive symptomatology, maternal self efficacy, and effects upon <b>maternal</b> attachment <b>quality.</b> Methods: Fifty-four women who had been screened for childbirth distress 2 years prior, agreed to participate in a telephone interview. Of these women 68. 5 % were previously classified as distressed and the remainder were non-distressed. Women completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Maternal Postnatal Attachment Scale (MPAS) and Parental Sense of Competency Scale (PSCS). Their infants’ mean age was 28. 9 months (SD[*]=[*] 2. 33 months) with 53. 7 % being male. Results: Seven participants, all previously distressed were still depressed (EPDS score of < 12).

40|$|Evidence {{has found}} that a {{distressing}} childbirth {{increases the risk of}} developing depression in the postpartum. High maternal self-efficacy has been found to protect against the development of postpartum depression (PPD), which negatively effects attachment quality. However {{little is known about the}} long-term effects of distress and depression upon <b>maternal</b> attachment <b>quality</b> beyond two years postpartum. This study examines the relationships between measures of previous distress, current depressive symptomatology, maternal self efficacy, and their effect upon <b>maternal</b> attachment <b>quality</b> beyond two years postpartum. A 30 minute telephone survey was conducted with 54 women who had been screened for distress in a previous study after giving birth two years prior in Queensland. Mean age at childbirth was 30. 2 years (SD = 5. 5 years), and 68. 5 % were previously classified as distressed. Participants’ infants’ mean age was 28. 9 months (SD = 2. 33 months, 53. 7 % male). Depression scores indicated that 7 participants, all previously depressed, currently had depression. Results imply that previous distress significantly increased the risk of depression at two years postpartum, and significantly decreased <b>maternal</b> attachment <b>quality.</b> Current depression was found to negatively affect <b>maternal</b> attachment <b>quality.</b> <b>Maternal</b> self-efficacy significantly positively correlated with <b>maternal</b> attachment <b>quality.</b> <b>Maternal</b> self-efficacy was found to moderate, rather than mediate, the relationship between current depression and maternal self-efficacy.

50|$|A {{study by}} Clutton-Brock (1984) on red deer (Cervus elaphus), a {{polygynous}} species, {{examined the effects}} of dominance rank and <b>maternal</b> <b>quality</b> on female breeding success and sex ratios of offspring. Based on the Trivers-Willard model, Clutton-Brock hypothesized that the sex ratio of mammalian offspring may change according to maternal condition, where high-ranked females should produce more male offspring and low-ranked females should produce more female offspring. This {{is based on the assumption}} that high-ranked females are in better condition, so that they have more access to resources and can afford to invest more in their offspring. In the study, high-ranked females were shown to give birth to healthier offspring than low-ranked females, and the offspring of high-ranked females also developed into healthier adults. Clutton-Brock suggested that the advantage of being a healthy adult was more beneficial for male offspring because stronger males are more capable of defending harems of females during breeding seasons. Therefore, Clutton-Brock proposed that males produced by females in better conditions are more likely to have greater reproductive success in the future than males produced by females in poorer conditions. These findings support the Trivers-Willard hypothesis, as parental quality affected the sex of their offspring, in such a way as to maximize their reproductive investment.|$|E

Waterfowl showing male-biased size dimorphism but female-biased philopatry are ideal for differentiating between these alternatives.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To assess <b>maternal</b> <b>quality</b> of life (QoL) {{during the}} {{postpartum}} period and {{to compare the}} performance of two QoL questionnaires across a sample of 101 women in southern Brazil. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} study that measures <b>maternal</b> <b>quality</b> of life during the postpartum period in Brazil. INTRODUCTION: There is limited information about postpartum <b>maternal</b> <b>quality</b> of life in Brazil. The are no Portuguese versions of instruments specifically designed to measure quality of life during the postpartum period. METHODS: Research participants completed the Portuguese version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment-Bref (WHOQOL-BREF) and Multicultural Quality of Life Index (MQLI) questionnaires. The correlations between the MQLI and the discrete areas of WHOQOL-BREF were examined using Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficients. RESULTS: We report a significant correlation between the global MQLI and the four domains of the WHOQOL-BREF scores (p < 0. 01). An analysis of variance revealed a significant difference in mean scores in the Psychological and Environment domains according to different socio-economic strata: F (3, 97) = 3. 81, p = 0. 012 and F (3, 97) = 4. 03, p = 0. 01, respectively. DISCUSSION: The WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire may be more sensitive than the MQLI in detecting the impact of socioeconomic status on the QoL of postpartum women. CONCLUSION: The sample of postpartum women evaluated in this study presented favorable QoL scores according to both the MQLI and WHOQOL-BREF questionnaires.

Data were collected from 96 mother-infant dyads (42 males) when the infants were 6, 9, 25, and 38 months old. Cognitive development as a control variable was measured with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II at 6 months. At 9 months, three aspects of <b>maternal</b> parenting <b>quality</b> (sensitivity, mind-mindedness, and encouragement of autonomy) were assessed with MBQS, mind-mindedness coding system, and encouragement of autonomy coding schema within a 15 -min mother–infant interaction. Three aspects of EF (working memory, inhibitory control, and delay EF) were measured at 25 and 38 months with age-appropriate tasks. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that maternal mind-mindedness had a more important effect than did the encouragement of autonomy and maternal sensitivity during infants’ preverbal period. More precisely, maternal mind-mindedness at 9 months predicted inhibitory control at 2 and 3 years, and maternal encouragement of autonomy predicted performance on delay EF tasks at 3 years, maternal sensitivity had no observed effect on children’s EF.

Although embryonic exposure to maternally derived glucocorticoids (i. e., corticosterone) generally reduces offspring quality, effects may adaptively match <b>maternal</b> <b>quality</b> with offspring demand. We present results from an interannual field experiment in European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) designed explicitly to examine the fitness consequences of exposing offspring to maternally derived stress hormones. We combined a manipulation of yolk corticosterone (yolk injections) with a manipulation of maternal chick‐rearing ability (feather clipping of mothers) to quantify the adaptive value of corticosterone‐induced offspring phenotypes in relation to <b>maternal</b> <b>quality.</b> We then examined how corticosterone‐induced “matching” within this current reproductive attempt affected future fecundity and maternal survival. First, our results provide support that low‐quality mothers transferring elevated corticosterone to eggs invest in daughters as predicted by sex allocation theory. Second, corticosterone‐mediated sex‐biased investment resulted in rapid male‐biased mortality resulting in brood reduction, which provided a better match between <b>maternal</b> <b>quality</b> and brood demand. Third, corticosterone‐mediated matching reduced investment in current reproduction for low‐quality mothers, resulting in fitness gains through increased survival and future fecundity. Results indicate that the transfer of stress hormones to eggs by low‐quality mothers can be adaptive since corticosterone‐mediated sex‐biased investment matches {{the quality of a}} mother to offspring demand, ultimately increasing maternal fitness. Our results also indicate that the branding of the proximate effects of maternal glucocorticoids on offspring as negative ignores the possibility that short‐term phenotypic changes may actually increase maternal fitness...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Around 80 % of {{intrauterine growth}} {{restricted}} (IUGR) infants are born at term. They have {{an increase in}} perinatal mortality and morbidity including behavioral problems, minor developmental delay and spastic cerebral palsy. Management is controversial, in particular the decision whether to induce labour or await spontaneous delivery with strict fetal and maternal surveillance. We propose a randomised trial to compare effectiveness, costs and <b>maternal</b> <b>quality</b> of life for induction of labour versus expectant management in women with a suspected IUGR fetus at term. METHODS/DESIGN: The proposed trial is a multi-centre randomised study in pregnant women who are suspected on clinical grounds of having an IUGR child at a gestational age between 36 + 0 and 41 + 0 weeks. After informed consent women will be randomly allocated to either induction of labour or expectant management with maternal and fetal monitoring. Randomisation will be web-based. The primary outcome measure will be a composite neonatal morbidity and mortality. Secondary outcomes will be severe maternal morbidity, <b>maternal</b> <b>quality</b> of life and costs. Moreover, we aim to assess neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral outcome at two years as assessed by a postal enquiry (Child Behavioral Check List-CBCL and Ages and Stages Questionnaire-ASQ). Analysis will be by intention to treat. Quality of life analysis and a preference study will also be performed in the same study population.

Interestingly, although avian nestlings experience multiple resource-based physiological trade-offs and undergo considerable morphological and physiological changes during postnatal development, there is no data available on how nestlings manage the competing demands of growth {{and the development of}} flight ability at this critical life-history stage. We examined numerous morphological traits to determine which are responsible for variation in flight performance in juvenile European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), a sexually size-dimorphic passerine. We then manipulated <b>maternal</b> <b>quality</b> during chick rearing (via feather clipping) to examine sex-specific sensitivity of fledgling flight performance {{to the quality of the}} rearing environment. Results suggest that the mechanics underlying variation in juvenile flight performance are relatively simple, being principally determined by the ratio of pectoral muscle mass to body mass (BM) and the surface area of the wings. Interestingly, although the <b>maternal</b> <b>quality</b> manipulation decreased BM and structural size in daughters, only the flight performance of sons was negatively affected. Our results suggest that a survival-related trait can be significantly affected in the larger sex when raised under stressful conditions. Furthermore, measuring only BM and structural size may not be sufficient in understanding how the sexes are affected by stressful rearing conditions in sexually size-dimorphic species.

40|$|Managing {{reproductive}} investment {{within the}} scope of an individual’s energetic condition is required to maximize fitness. To be successful, individuals must make the correct decisions about when to reproduce, when to abandon an attempt, how many resources to invest in current and future attempts and where those resources should be allocated.

However, how the decisions are physiologically mediated to balance these trade-offs and maximize fitness is not well understood. This thesis examines how the stress hormone corticosterone mediates reproductive decisions and asks how offspring and maternal fitness are affected by individual variation in corticosterone using an avian model, the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris). Because corticosterone maintains daily homeostatic energetic balance, it is correlated with individual energetic condition and is therefore a potential hormonal link between maternal and offspring quality. In starlings, intra-specific variation in plasma corticosterone is related to maternal condition and high baseline levels are associated with nest abandonment. Elevated maternal corticosterone is also transferred to eggs via the yolk, and intra- and inter-clutch variation in yolk corticosterone are high and significantly negatively related to <b>maternal</b> <b>quality,</b> indicating that yolk corticosterone may cue offspring to variation in <b>maternal</b> <b>quality.</b> Indeed, experimentally elevated yolk corticosterone selectively decreases male offspring quality and increases pre- and post-natal male mortality. For the mother, the result is an allocation towards evolutionarily less-expensive daughters and a sex-specific lowering of current reproductive investment. This energy-savings increases investment in future fecundity and increases maternal survival. Finally, the quality of the maternal environment can cause both pre-natal programming and post-natal plasticity in the adrenocortical axis of their offspring. This thesis has revealed that individual variation in <b>maternal</b> <b>quality</b> as mediated by corticosterone has significant and potentially sex-specific proximate effects on offspring. Exposing offspring to the effects of maternal corticosterone plays adaptive roles at multiple reproductive stages and ultimately increases maternal fitness. Together, the work here provides an evolutionary framework for how maternal stress hormones can mediate multiple reproductive decisions and life-history trade-offs in vertebrates...|$|E

Despite an accumulation of evidence that mothers can sex‐specifically modulate investment in offspring in relation to <b>maternal</b> <b>quality,</b> few mechanisms have been proposed as to how this is achieved. We explored a hormonal mechanism for sex‐biased maternal investment by measuring and experimentally manipulating baseline levels of the stress hormone corticosterone in laying wild female European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and examining effects on sex ratio and sex‐specific offspring phenotype adjustment. Here we show that baseline plasma corticosterone is negatively correlated with energetic body condition in laying starlings, and subsequent experimental elevation of maternal baseline plasma corticosterone increased yolk corticosterone without altering maternal condition or egg quality per se. Hormonal elevation resulted in the following: female‐biased hatching sex ratios (caused by elevated male embryonic mortality), lighter male offspring at hatching (which subsequently grew more slowly during postnatal development), and lower cell‐mediated immune (phytohemagglutinin) responses in males compared with control‐born males; female offspring were unaffected by the manipulation in both years of the study. Elevated maternal corticosterone therefore resulted in a sex‐biased adjustment of offspring quality favorable to female offspring via both a sex ratio bias and a modulation of male phenotype at hatching. In birds, deposition of yolk corticosterone may benefit mothers by acting as a bet‐hedging strategy in stochastic environments where the correlation between environmental cues at laying (and therefore potentially maternal condition) and conditions during chick‐rearing might be low and unpredictable. Together with recent studies in other vertebrate taxa, {{these results suggest that}} maternal stress hormones provide a mechanistic link between <b>maternal</b> <b>quality</b> and sex‐biased maternal investment in offspring...|$|E

The Kalmyk breed has no equals among other cattle breeds in terms of robustness, hardiness, strength of the frame and conformation. Therefore, the technique for breeding it can be even more yielding, more simple and cheaper than for other beef cattle breeds. The Kalmyk breed is represented by quite large animals. Live weight of cows is around 500 kilograms, bulls - 700-800 kilograms. Cows have excellent <b>maternal</b> <b>qualities.</b> They never have calving problems. The cows will never allow any predators, including wolves or even unfamiliar people to approach not only the calves but also the herd itself. In harsh steppe conditions they raise their calves up to 180-200 kilograms by the age of 6-8 months.|$|R
