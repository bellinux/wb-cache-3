40|$|A {{child is}} {{presented}} with mucopolysaccharidosis VII (beta-glucuronidase deficiency), bringing to six {{the number of}} reported patients with the infantile onset form of this disorder. This patient exhibited the following features, previously unrecognised {{as part of this}} syndrome: presentation in the neonatal period, progressive joint contractures, and hydrocephalus. This child's course and data from published reports indicate that mucopolysaccharidosis VII, unlike the other known mucopolysaccharidoses, is clinically recognisable in the newborn period and is most likely to be associated with <b>moderate</b> <b>mental</b> <b>deficiency</b> which does not progress over time...|$|E
40|$|The {{acquisition}} of markers concerning spatial relations by 6 - to 14 -year-old children suffering from <b>moderate</b> <b>mental</b> <b>deficiency</b> {{has been studied}} within the framework concerning lexical psychosemantics elaborated by Pierart (1975 a). Some of the children had been born severely premature, and some were trisomics. The special features of the {{acquisition of}} the spatial markers by the two samples {{are in line with}} the patterns of normally developing children and confirm the psychosemantic models. The dissociation of language structures due to the cognitive developmental pathology enhances the comprehension of normal developmental processes...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBackground: Rab-GDI {{mutations}} {{are responsible}} for "pure" <b>mental</b> <b>deficiency,</b> without any specific clinical features or brain malformation. Therefore, screening for mutations in mentally retarded patients is not available on a routine basis. Moreover, neuronal networks involved in <b>mental</b> <b>deficiency</b> still remain largely unknown. Methods: We performed a fine neuropsychological and imaging study in five patients from two unrelated families, affected with <b>mental</b> <b>deficiency</b> due to a mutation in the Rab-GDI gene. High resolution 3 D brain MRI of the five mentally retarded adult males (mean age 33 years) were compared to MRI of 14 healthy males (mean age 35 years) using a Voxel-Based Morphometric analysis (VBM). Results: All patients had isolated <b>moderate</b> <b>mental</b> retardation (WAIS-III IQ range, 41 - 50; mean 45) without specific morphological or behavioural features. No obvious brain abnormality was observed on visual inspection of individual scans. Using VBM analysis, Rab-GDI mutated patients' MRIs exhibited significant brain changes compared to normal subjects (p < 0. 05, corrected for multiple comparisons) : increased grey matter density in left cerebellum and in left angular gyrus, decreased grey matter volume in thalami, decreased white matter density in prefrontal lobes, right fusiform occipito-temporal gyrus, and decreased white matter volume in cerebellar peduncles. Conclusions: These morphological changes observed in Rab-GDI mutated patients, mainly localized in the cerebello-thalamo-prefrontal pathway, {{are consistent with the}} hypothesis that the cerebellum is one of the critical components of a global learning network. Our results open new avenues in the diagnosis of non-specific <b>mental</b> <b>deficiency</b> using gene-specific "brain maps" as endophenotypes. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

40|$|International audienceTen {{percent of}} cases of {{intellectual}} deficiency in boys are caused by genes located on the X chromosome. X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) includes more than 200 syndromes and 80 genes identified to date. The fragile X syndrome is the most frequent syndrome, due to a dynamic mutation with a CGG triplet amplification. Mental retardation is virtually always present. Phonological and syntactic impairments are often combined with pragmatic language impairment and visuospatial reasoning difficulties. A minority fulfill the criteria for autism. In girls, the clinical expression of the complete mutation varies according to the X chromosome inactivation profile. Several XLMR occur as severe early onset encephalopathies: Lowe oculocerebrorenal syndrome, ATR-X syndrome (alpha thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked), Allan-Herdon-Dudley syndrome (MCT 8 gene). Two genes, ARX (X-LAG; Partington syndrome) and MECP 2 (Rett syndrome in females; mild MR with spastic diplegia/psychotic problems in males) are associated with various phenotypes, according to the mutation involved. Oligophrenine 1 (OPHN- 1) gene mutations lead to vermal dysplasia. PQBP 1 gene mutations (Renpenning syndrome) are responsible for <b>moderate</b> to severe <b>mental</b> <b>deficiency,</b> microcephaly, and small stature. Although some forms of XLMR are not very specific and the phenotype for each given gene is somewhat heterogeneous, a clinical diagnostic strategy is emerging...|$|R
40|$|A {{brother and}} two sisters of {{remotely}} consanguineous parents had congenital laryngeal abductor paralysis and <b>moderate</b> <b>mental</b> retardation. In the two older sibs, <b>mental</b> <b>deficiency</b> could have resulted from birth asphyxia, but the youngest girl was already microcephalic at birth and had no apparent asphyxia. The mother, who was healthy and of normal intelligence, was found on laryngoscopy to have unilateral laryngeal abductor paralysis. This is the first family with both mentally retarded and nonretarded affected members with congenital laryngeal abductor paralysis. Inheritance is most likely autosomal dominant with variable expression, but autosomal recessive inheritance, with both parents carriers and the mother an affected homozygote, and X linked inheritance are also possible...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was {{to find out how}} people with a <b>moderate</b> <b>mental</b> {{disorder}} experience sexuality. We wanted to examinate whether sexuality is important for them, whether they talk about it and who they talk to. The research also wanted to establish whether they have a need for tenderness, whether they masturbate and whether they desire to start a family. 37 people with a <b>moderate</b> <b>mental</b> disorder from three mental health care institutions (Varstveno delovni center Tončke Hočevar in Ljubljana Šiška, Stanovanjska skupina Mimoza in Izola and Center za usposabljanje, delo in varstvo Črna na Koroškem) took part in the research. The research showed that people with a <b>moderate</b> <b>mental</b> disorder find sexuality important; however, sexuality is rarely discussed, neither with people with a <b>moderate</b> <b>mental</b> disorder nor with their parents, professionals who work with them or in society in general. People with a <b>moderate</b> <b>mental</b> disorder need constant education about sexuality. They wish to be touched and kissed and they feel attracted to the opposite sex. Many of them want to have their own family. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} impact and the {{subjective}} benefit of Bone-anchored Hearing Aid (BAHA) implementation in patients with hearing impairment combined with <b>moderate</b> <b>mental</b> retardation. STUDY DESIGN: Case control study using two validated patient-oriented instruments. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Twenty-two patients with <b>moderate</b> <b>mental</b> retardation and conductive or mixed hearing loss. INTERVENTION: Rehabilitative. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Subjective benefit, listening and learning capabilities. RESULTS: BAHA implementation in patients with <b>moderate</b> <b>mental</b> retardation, by using the Glasgow Children's Benefit Inventory and the Listening Inventory for Education, showed a subjective benefit, which was comparable {{with that of the}} control group and was consistent with the results of earlier studies. CONCLUSION: The use of BAHA proved beneficial in most patients with hearing impairment and <b>moderate</b> <b>mental</b> retardation.
