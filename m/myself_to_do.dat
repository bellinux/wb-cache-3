25|$|Arthur Berry... was a {{good teacher}} and focus for art {{activity}} at the Burslem & Stoke Art School. I do not agree that he is for many the finest 20th century artist from Stoke - there are other candidates also. Mr Berry's work lies somewhere between painting and drawing - for me paint and its properties hold most attraction. Mr Berry's talent was spread over several areas - drawing, painting, writing, plays, poems and teaching. I do not think I am good enough <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> several things well, so concentrate on one (painting). Mr Berry said he admired Lowry and once encountered him in a Manchester Gallery - said he was built and made for a particular task - as an artist recording the vanishing industrial scene of Manchester....Mr Berry was, I feel, a humorist whose interest was {{the people of the}} old working class of Stoke - a type of person who no longer exists. I mostly liked his landscapes. They seemed to convey that strange Stoke light which appeals to me and the old buildings and streets which were very much part of my own childhood and youth.|$|E
500|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the pardon, Ford often declined to mention President Nixon by name, referring to him in public as [...] "my predecessor" [...] or [...] "the former president." [...] When, on a 1974 trip to California, White House correspondent Fred Barnes pressed Ford on the matter, Ford replied in surprisingly frank manner: [...] "I just can’t bring <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it.” ...|$|E
500|$|Following Omkara, Kapoor took a {{short break}} from acting, as she felt that [...] "nothing [...] {{challenging}} {{enough for me to}} say yes". In an interview with The Times of India Kapoor commented, [...] "In my initial years in the industry, I pushed <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a lot of work because I was greedy. I did some films—which I now regret—purely for the money. Today, I want to do selective films." [...] Later that year, she appeared briefly in one of the year's biggest hits, the Farhan Akhtar action-thriller Don (a remake of the 1978 film of the same name).|$|E

5000|$|Though he has {{recently}} been starring a character actor, Chunky doesn't want to be pigeonholed into doing comic roles. [...] "I don't think I am restricting <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> only comedy. I am hoping that someone offers me something else," [...] Pandey said. [...] "It {{requires a lot of}} guts for someone to cast me in something else. I am just hoping that someone sees something else in me other than comedy." ...|$|R

500|$|In a 2003 {{interview}} with Kerrang!, DeLonge claimed {{the album was}} only an attempt to [...] "challenge <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> different shit": [...] "I did it for myself, whether it sold a million copies or just one, it was for myself." [...] He clarified the band's future succinctly: [...] "There {{are a lot of}} emotions between Mark and I and that's why there’s never going to be another Box Car Racer album. It was never meant to be something that would alienate anybody." [...] The article's author, Tom Bryant, describes the album's effect on subsequent Blink-182 albums: [...] "It allowed , and therefore the band, to assess whether, approaching or in their 30s, they still really wanted to be writing songs about splitting up from teenage sweethearts or whether it was time to address something a little more serious and a little more important." ...|$|E
500|$|Although forty-eight {{drivers were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier; {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only forty-three could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Johnson clinched his fifth pole position of the season, {{with a time of}} 31.049. He was joined on the grid's front row by Scott Speed. Marcos Ambrose qualified third, Martin took fourth and Stewart started fifth. Harvick, Newman, Greg Biffle, Bill Elliott and Bowyer completed the top ten fastest qualifiers. Kurt Busch, one of the drivers in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, qualified twelfth, while Jeff Gordon set the twentieth fastest time. The five drivers who failed to qualify were Joe Nemechek, Dave Blaney, Mike Skinner, Max Papis and David Stremme. After the qualifier Johnson said, [...] "I had a talk with <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what I could today and don't freak out if it's not as good as what Mark [...] ran. I kept my emotions in check and drove the car with the right touch and feel, and that comes from being relaxed, so it went well." ...|$|E
500|$|American street artist Fairey guest {{starred in}} [...] "Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart" [...] as himself. The {{graffiti}} art featuring Homer's {{face and the}} word [...] "dope" [...] that Bart creates in the episode is a reference to Fairey's Barack Obama [...] "Hope" [...] poster and his OBEY Giant image. Fairey has said that The Simpsons {{has been one of}} his favorite television shows since the early 1990s because of its [...] "blend of humor and social commentary", and he felt [...] "deeply honored" [...] to be included in an episode. Fairey wrote on his website that [...] "Part of being on The Simpsons, is you’re being honored as a reference point in culture." [...] He described the plot of the episode as [...] "great", adding that the staff members of the show [...] "were kind enough to indulge a couple of my dialogue suggestions designed to make the social commentary more pointed (even though I had to make fun of <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so)." [...] This was Fairey's first acting performance. Street artists English, Scharf, and Conal also guest starred in the episode as themselves.|$|E

2500|$|Following The Paranoids, Hendler {{made his}} first {{incursion}} on television appearing on an episode of the series Mujeres Asesinas ("Killer Women"), and in 2008 was seen on the comedy series Aquí no hay quien viva, playing a lazy janitor named Roman. [...] "I wanted to bring <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> television and, as time passed, not having traveled that path was increasingly weighing on me," [...] said Hendler in an interview for Clarín.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the main}} reasons for doubting the truth of the inquest {{concerns}} the reliability of Marlowe's companions as witnesses. As an agent provocateur for the late Sir Francis Walsingham, Robert Poley was a consummate liar, the [...] "very genius of the Elizabethan underworld", and is even on record as saying [...] "I will swear and forswear myself, rather than I will accuse <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> me any harm." [...] The other witness, Nicholas Skeres, had for many years acted as a confidence trickster, drawing young men into the clutches of people in the money-lending racket, including Marlowe's apparent killer, Ingram Frizer, with whom he was currently engaged in just such a swindle. In other words, despite their being referred to as [...] "generosi" [...] (gentlemen) in the inquest report, they were all professional liars.|$|E
2500|$|Boyer {{admitted}} that two other books he had written, An Illustrated Life of Doc Holliday (Reminder Press, 1966), and Wyatt Earp’s Tombstone Vendetta, (Talie, 1993) were {{not based on}} the documents {{he claimed to have}} used. He followed the last book with a fourteen-part series in True West magazine titled Wyatt Earp, Legendary American. Boyer responded to continuing questions about his sources and allegations of fraud, claiming that because of his close connection to the [...] Earp family, he [...] "had a license to say any darned thing I please for the purpose [...] of protecting the reputation of the Earp Boys, which I committed <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> [...] I can lie, cheat, and steal, and figuratively ambush, antagonize, poison wells, [...] and all of the others [...] things that go with a first class Vendetta, even a [...] figurative one." ...|$|E

2500|$|The US tour resumed in March {{with the}} band playing three sold-out shows at Radio City Music Hall in New York City from March 18 to March 20. Fleets of trucks were hired to {{transport}} the band's equipment, lighting and wardrobe across {{thousands of miles of}} road over the next three months. During the band's time spent commuting across America, Andrew began writing and playing new material with a guitar. In the Official Inside Story of a Band on the road, Andrew said, [...] "Prior to the Kick tour I'd never written on the road – mainly because I didn't have time I guess. But with Kick I started writing with a guitar, and I was kind of proud that I'd taught <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that". INXS finished up the second leg of the American tour with a hand-full of shows being played in key cities across the California state, including San Francisco, Fresno and San Diego.|$|E
2500|$|Duff herself co-wrote three {{tracks on}} the album: [...] "Mr. James Dean", [...] "Haters" [...] and [...] "Rock This World", {{the first two}} of which, along with [...] "The Last Song", Haylie co-wrote. Hilary said she refrained from co-writing the entire album because [...] "I don't know if I'm secure enough with <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that". She has characterised [...] "Haters" [...] as [...] "tongue-in-cheek" [...] and said people would {{know what it is}} about when they heard it, and it {{attracted}} substantial publicity when rumors circulated that it was about actress Lindsay Lohan, with whom Duff was alleged to have been feuding. The Scoop, a gossip section of the website MSNBC, quoted an insider who had said, [...] "Hilary thinks that Lindsay has been directing negativity at her for too long." [...] Duff denied that the rumors were true, saying she did not know Lohan and would not write a song about her. She said that at the time she wrote it she was feeling she had to openly discuss her personal life because [...] "people make accusations and there are lies and rumors constantly ... people are so negative. They love to read what's coming out next on Page Six [...] and I just felt like it was appropriate." [...] She said she felt [...] "normal girls" [...] could relate to the song because of the [...] "petty stuff" [...] that occurs in schools.|$|E
