50|$|Pithou wrote many {{legal and}} {{historical}} books, besides preparing editions of several ancient writers. His earliest publication was Adversariorum subsectorum lib. II. (1565). In 1569, {{he became the}} first to publish Landolfus Sagax' Historia Romana, and under the name by which it became better known: Historia <b>Miscella.</b> Perhaps his edition of the Leges Visigothorum (1579) was his most valuable contribution to historical science; in the same line he edited the Capitula of Charlemagne, Louis the Pious, and Charles the Bald in 1588; he assisted his brother François in preparing the Corpus juris canonici (1687).|$|E
5000|$|Yet {{another view}} was {{expressed}} by German theologian Martin Luther in his [...] "On Governmental Authority" [...] (1523). There {{he speaks of}} the fewness of good rulers, taking this lack as a punishment for human wickedness. He then alludes to this fable to illustrate how humanity deserves the rulers it gets: 'frogs must have their storks.' The author Christoff Mürer has a similar sentiment in his emblem book XL emblemata <b>miscella</b> nova (1620). Under the title Freheit there is a verse that warns that {{those who do not}} appreciate freedom are sent a tyrant by divine will.|$|E
5000|$|Compilers of emblem books {{also began}} using the fable as an illustration. Titled in Dutch as “The Toad and the Rat“, it {{appeared}} in Eduwaert de Dene's De Warachtighe Fabulen der Dieren (True Animal Fables, 1567). There it is accompanied by the proverb “The ill you do comes back to you” and an engraving of the toad towing the rat over a broad river as a falcon swoops down upon them. A similar design reversed appears in Christoph Murer’s XL emblemata <b>miscella</b> nova (1622), with moralising lines that ascribe the tale to Aesop “who can be trusted” under the ironical title “Friends in misfortune” (Amici in tempore adverso).|$|E

The Frisian villanelles deal with the farmer’s life in a mildly comical way. Back when they were composed, the West Frisian language wasn’t considered as a language suitable for serious songs yet. Only with Gysbert Japix did this appreciation come into existence, and was the language seen as suitable for subjects such as serious love poetry, political chants, and psalms.|$|E
50|$|Just as Abstemius {{had seen}} the moral merit of the Mediaeval symbol of the bear and the bees, so the compilers of Renaissance Emblem books were to follow him in using it {{to point to the}} {{consequences}} of giving way to anger. Joachim Camerarius the Younger included it under the title Violenta Nocent as Emblem 23 in his Symbolorum et Emblematum Centuriae Quatuor (1595). The accompanying distich warns that violence brings ill to its author and Camerarius goes on to comment that the Italian writer Luca Contile had earlier associated the symbol with violence. Another who used the emblem was Cristoph Murer under the title of Libido Vindictae (desire for vengeance) in XL emblemata <b>miscella</b> nova, which was posthumously published in 1620. He also noted that rage is immediately followed by a similar reply.|$|E

At this time also the neo-Latin poet Pantaleon Candidus alluded to it in describing [...] "those who aspire to great honours". A contemporary English reference in The Conversations at Little Gidding (about 1630) also mentions ‘Aesops Asse interpreting the Prostrate Worship of the People that was offered to the Golden Image on his back as intended to his Beastliness’. This, however, was {{in the context of}} making a distinction between a man and his religious office.

50|$|The Turcilingi are {{mentioned}} {{in only two}} independent sources: {{three times in the}} Getica of Jordanes and once in the Historia <b>Miscella</b> of Landulf Sagax. They are also mentioned once in the Historia Langobardorum of Paul the Deacon in a passage that is a derivative of Jordanes. Johann Kaspar Zeuss, followed by Karl V. Müllenhoff, believed that the 'Ρουτίχλειοι mentioned in the Geographia of Ptolemy (II.11.7) were the Turcilingi, but this thesis requires a complex etymology. Landulf Sagax lists them together with the Scirii among the nations which participated on the side of Attila and the Huns at the Battle of Châlons. Landulf is the unique source for this information; though he is a very late source (tenth century), it is probable that he had access to now lost sources and there is nothing inherently improbable about the Turcilingi being present at Châlons along with the Scirii as Hunnic allies.|$|E
50|$|The Breviarium historiae Romanae is a {{complete}} compendium, in ten books, of Roman history from {{the foundation of the}} city to the accession of Valens. It was compiled with considerable care from the best accessible authorities, and is written generally with impartiality, and in a clear and simple style. It was much used by other Roman chroniclers. Although the Latin in some instances differs from that of the purest models, the work was for a long time a favorite elementary school-book. Its independent value is small, but it sometimes fills a gap left by the more authoritative records. For the Republican period, Eutropius depended upon an epitome of Livy; for the later parts, he appears to have used Suetonius and the now lost Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte. For the end he could also make use of his own personal experience. The Breviarium was enlarged and continued down to the time of Eastern Roman Emperor Justinian the Great by Paulus Diaconus; the work of the latter was in turn enlarged by Landolfus Sagax (c. 1000), and taken down to the time of the emperor Leo the Armenian (813-820) in the Historia <b>Miscella.</b>|$|E

A technologically feasible cottonseed oil-isopropyl alcohol (IPA) <b>miscella</b> refining process was developed to produce high quality cottonseed oil. Individual steps necessary to refine cottonseed oil-IPA <b>miscella</b> were determined and improved. These were: 1) homogenization of the cottonseed oil-IPA <b>miscella</b> with caustic solution; 2) centrifugation; 3) separation of <b>miscella</b> layers; 4) desolventization, 5) water washing and drying; and 6) bleaching. In neutralization, the <b>miscella</b> was mixed with 20 Be' caustic solution (50 % excess) by using a Sonolator for 15 times. The refined oils from both the bottom and top layers were water washed using 12. 5 % and 20 % (w/w) hot water, respectively. The water washing efficiently recovered the oil from the top layer <b>miscella</b> and reduced the soap and phosphorus content. The water washed and dried oils from the bottom and top layers were treated with 0. 5 % and 4 % (w/w) acid activated bleaching clay, respectively. Good quality refined and bleached oil was obtained. However, the quality of the bleached oil produced from bottom layer was better than that from the top layer.

The optimization of batch adsorption process {{was carried out in}} a 30 % oil <b>miscella</b> (the usual <b>miscella</b> concentration) via the Response Surface Methodology as a function of both the amount of total adsorbent (TA) and the percentage of activated earths (E) used in these blends with carbon. Both the adsorption of pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids) and hydroperoxides was significantly affect-ed by TA and E (linear and/or quadratic terms). In addition, an interaction effect (TA x E) was observed on the reduction of the residual content of these compounds. However, for final oxidation products (FOP), no interaction effect (TA x E) was observed and only the linear terms of TA and E showed to be significant on the response. Tridimensional response surfaces, described by second order polynomials, were fitted to the experimental data points concerning the residual content of pigments and initial oxidation products in <b>miscella.</b> The adsorption of FOP was fitted to a flat surface. In organic solution, the selective batch adsorption to the blends of activated earths and carbon occurs in the following order: chlorophylls carotenoids hydroperoxides final oxidation products.

In the present study influence of coupling chemical pretreatment and membrane filtration (micelle enhanced ultrafiltration) on quality and stability of canola oil was investigated. It has been conducted on adding chemical agents (CaCl 2, EDTA and SDS aqueous solutions) to canola oil <b>miscella</b> before ultrafiltration through polyvinylidenfluoride (PVDF) membrane with molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO) 100 kDa and 50 kDa in a magnetically stirred flat membrane cell. Operation temperature and pressure was constant at 25 ̊C and 2 bar, respectively. SDS solution lowered phospholipids content almost completely. The reduction of phenolic compounds in SDS- and EDTA-pretreated filtered oil was more noticeable than in the processed <b>miscella.</b> On the contrary, the reduction of FFAs was more in the <b>miscella</b> filtered without any chemical agents. The membrane exhibited no appreciable affinity towards tocopherols and carbonyl compounds in the oil samples.

A mistura foi filtrada, resfriada a 10 °C e, a seguir, centrifugada para separação das fases: uma fase com consistência de gel (micela rica), contendo 75 % de óleo e 25 % de etanol, e a outra líquida, contendo 2, 4 % de óleo e 97, 6 % de etanol (micela pobre). Pelas características apresentadas, a micela rica tem potencial para ser utilizada no preparo de cremes vegetais como substituto parcial de gorduras hidrogenadas, cujos efeitos biológicos na saúde dos consumidores vêm provocando muitas polêmicas. Além de ser uma alternativa na obtenção de gorduras para a formulação de alimentos mais seguros, a tecnologia proposta poderá ser estendida a diferentes oleaginosas de interesse comercial, eliminando o uso de n-hexano no processamento de óleos e gorduras vegetais.

40|$|This {{work has}} been {{initiated}} to assess the feasibility of bleaching cottonseed oil in <b>miscella</b> as a processing step next to alkali refining in <b>miscella.</b> Alkali refining of cottonseed oil in <b>miscella</b> has several advantages over conventional refining technologies with respect to oil quality, oil losses and process cost. Therefore, the process efficiency of the bleaching of cottonseed oil in presence of hexane (at a volumetric ratio of 1 : 1), has been studied and compared to that without solvent. The process efficiency has been evaluated according to the decolourization capacity, the oil losses on spent earth, the filtration rate of the oil from the clay and the acidity of the bleached oil {{as well as its}} peroxide content. The bleaching in presence of hexane was carried out at 25 &# 194;&# 186;C whereas that by conventional bleaching at 110 &# 194;&# 186;C. Different clay loads were used in each of the two bleaching techniques and the colour indices of the oils before and after bleaching determined in each case. The results were used to predict Freundlich adsorption equations for the oil pigments in both cases. These equations were then used to predict the colour of the oils obtained by bleaching of refined oils of different grades. The results have shown that oil decolourization is more efficient in presence of solvent when the starting oil is of an acceptable grade and the reverse is true for low grade oils. Also, the possibility of oil oxidation during bleaching is less in presence of solvent. Moreover, the bleaching in <b>miscella</b> has proved two other additional advantages over conventional bleaching. The filtration of oil from clay is much faster in <b>miscella</b> bleaching and the oil losses on spent earth is lower. This will be reflected on the overall process economy.

40|$|Collective {{communication}} over a {{group of}} processors is an integral and time consuming component in many HPC applications. Many modern day supercomputers are based on torus interconnects. On such systems, for an irregular communicator comprising of a subset of processors, the algorithms developed so far are not contention free in general and hence non-optimal. In this paper, we present a novel contention-free algorithm to perform collective operations over a subset of processors in a torus network. We also extend previous work on regular communicators to handle special cases of irregular communicators that occur frequently in parallel scientific applications. For the generic case where multiple node disjoint sub-communicators communicate simultaneously in a loosely synchronous fashion, we propose a novel cooperative approach to route the data for individual subcommunicators without contention. Empirical results demonstrate that our algorithms outperform the optimized MPI collective implementation on IBM’s Blue Gene/P supercomputer for large data sizes and random node distributions.

Experiments with mixed enzymes at the different conditions proved that highest % increase in oil extractability (38 %) over the control were achieved under the following conditions of hydrolysis: 2 % enzyme concentration (1 : 1 and 2 : 1 M:P ratio) at 1 : 10 bran:water ratio and 3 and 6 h hydrolysis and 1. 5 % enzyme concentration (1 : 1 M:P ratio) at 1 : 10 bran:water ratio for 6 h hydrolysis.

40|$|Spent nickel {{catalyst}} (SNC) has {{the potential}} of insulting the quality of the environment in a number of ways. Its disposal has a pollution effect. Optimum recovery of fat from SNC, could save the environment and reduce the oil loss. Hexane has been the solvent of choice for oil extraction. Alternative solvents considered to have been safer have been evaluated. Hexane, isopropanol, ethanol and heptane were examined using soxhlet extraction. While hexane is more efficient in oil recovery from SNC, isopropanol proved to be very good in clear separation of oil from waste material and also provides high solvent recovery compared to other solvents. Isopropanol extraction with chill separation of <b>miscella</b> into lower oil-rich phase, and an upper, solvent-rich recyclable phase save mush energy of vaporization for distilling. An aqueous extraction process with immiscible solvent assisted was tested. Solvent like hexane added to SNC, and water added later with continuous stirring. The mixture was stirred for about 30 minutes, prior to centrifugation. Aqueous process extracted less amount of oil compared to solvent extraction...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Late Palaeocene Dir Group {{records the}} {{resumption}} fvolcanic activity {{along the southern}} margin of Eurasia after a prolonged period of uplift and erosion. The group forms {{an integral part of}} the Kohistan Batholith and is readily divisible into two distinctly contrasting volcanic successions. The Baraul Banda Slate Formation comprises 2700 m of fore-arc sandstones and siltstones. The basin formed uring the collapse of the Kohistan continental margin and was filled initially by subaerial debris and mass-flow deposits. Subsidence was rapid such that> 90 % of the sedimentary record consists of thin-bedded sheet urbidites. These maintain a remarkable ateral continuity and indicate deposition i a restricted eep-water nviron-ment. Rare interbedded limestones have yielded a Thanetian (60. 2 - 5 zL 9 Ma) marine fauna of Miscellanea <b>miscella</b> nd Actinosiphon tibeticus. In direct contrast he Utror Volcanic Formation comprises 3000 m of volcaniclastic sedimentary material, lava flows and ignimbrites. Eruptive style was predominantly explosive with fragmental material dominating the volcanic record. Lavas range in composition from 53 % to 79 % SiO 2 with rhyolite the predominant rock type. A basaltic andesite has an 4 °Ar- 39 Ar age of 55 + 2 Ma. Although the volcanic stratigraphy is comple...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{study of}} the Paleocene–Eocene {{boundary}} within a foreland basin of southern Tibet, which was dominated by a carbonate ramp depositional environment, documents more complex environmental conditions than {{can be derived from}} studies of the deep oceanic environment. Extinction rates for larger foraminiferal species in the Zongpu- 1 Section apply to up to 46 % of the larger foraminiferal taxa. The extinction rate in southern Tibet is similar to rates elsewhere in the world, but it shows that the Paleocene fauna disappeared stepwise through the Late Paleocene, with Eocene taxa appearing abruptly above the boundary. A foraminifera turnover was identified between Members 3 and 4 of the Zongpu Formation—from the Miscellanea–Daviesina assemblage to an Orbitolites–Alveolina assemblage. The Paleocene and Eocene boundary is between the SBZ 4 and SBZ 5, where it is marked by the extinction of Miscellanea <b>miscella</b> and the first appearance of Alveolina ellipsodalis and a large number of Orbitolites. Chemostratigraphically, the δ 13 C values from both the Zongpu- 1 and Zongpu- 2 Sections show three negative excursions in the transitional strata, one in Late Paleocene, one at the boundary, and one in the early Eocene. The second negative excursion of δ 13 C, which is located at the P–E boundary, coincides with larger foraminifera overturn. These faunal changes and the observed δ 13 C negative excursions provide new evidence on environmental changes across the Paleocene–Eocene boundary in Tibet...|$|E
40|$|The Italian Strong Motion Database, ITACA, was {{developed}} within projects 2 S 6 and S 4, funded {{in the framework}} of the agreements between the Italian Department of 3 Civil Protection (Dipartimento della Protezione Civile, DPC) and the Istituto Nazionale di 4 Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV), starting from 2005. The alpha version of the database 5 was released in 2007 and subsequently upgraded to version 1. 0 after: (i) including the most 6 recent strongmotion data (from 2005 to 2007) recorded in Italy, in addition to the 2008 Parma 7 earthquake, M 5. 4, and the M 4. 0, 2009 Abruzzo seismic events; (ii) processing the raw 8 strong motion data using an updated procedure; (iii) increasing the number of stations with a 9 measured shear wave velocity profile; (iv) improving the utilities to retrieve time series and 10 ground motion parameters; (v) implementing a tool for selecting time series in agreement 11 with design-response spectra; (vi) compiling detailed station reports containing <b>miscella</b> 12 neous information such as photo, maps and site parameters; (vii) developing procedures for 13 the automatic generation of station reports and for the updating of the header files. After such 14 improvements, ITACA 1. 0 was published at the web site [URL] in 2010. It 15 presently contains 3, 955 three-component waveforms, comprising the most complete cata 16 logue of the Italian accelerometric records in the period 1972 – 2007 (3, 562 records) and the 17 strongest events in the period 2008 – 2009. Records were mainly acquired by DPC through its 18 Accelerometric National Network (RAN) and, in few cases, by local networks and temporary 19 stations or networks.

40|$|The Paleogene larger foraminiferal biostratigraphy {{is today}} rather well {{assessed}} for the Tethyan domain. In order {{to contribute to}} the full integration of the Middle-East in the widely employed Shallow Benthic Zonation, a preliminary report on the Paleocene-Early Eocene larger foraminiferal assemblages from Yemen and Oman is provided here. The sections investigated in Yemen range in age from the Upper Cretaceous to the Oligocene. The Paleogene of Yemen is widely affected by dolomitization and only by analyzing over 1, 700 thin sections from 60 stratigraphic sections (mainly from Hadramaut and Socotra) it has been possible to adequately investigate the fossil assemblages. In contrast, the deposits from northern Oman are characterized by rich and extraordinarily well-preserved Paleocene-Lower Eocene larger foraminiferal assemblages. This preliminary report focuses mainly on the Paleocene-Early Eocene deposits of the Umm-er-Radhuma Formation. The Paleocene-Lower Eocene assemblages are characterized by strong affinities with northern Somalia. Hyaline forms such as Daviesina khatiyahi, Miscellanea gr. rhomboidea/ dukhani, M. <b>miscella,</b> Saudia, Sakesaria, Lockhartia, Ranikothalia, Dictyokathina largely prevail in SBZ 3 - 4 deposits. Nummulites, Ranikothalia and Daviesina ruida characterize the Lower Ypresian. Subordinately, porcelaneous forms such as “Taberina” daviesi and conical agglutinated (Daviesiconus) also occur; alveolinids (such as Alveolina vredenburgi and A. decipiens) are relatively abundant in the basal Lower Ypresian of Socotra. In contrast to the coeval deposits from Yemen, the Paleocene section of Oman (Wadi Duqm, Abat-Tiwi platform) yields very well-preserved larger foraminiferal assemblages and agglutinated and porcelaneous forms are well represented. The occurrence of abundant Globoreticulina paleocenica is noteworthy along with an as yet undescribed Lacazinella species. The co-occurrence of Coskinon sp., “Plumokathina dienii”, Dictyoconus turriculus and Miscellanites globularis seems to indicate SBZ 2.

40|$|The {{proportions}} of testa, endosperm, cotyledon and soluble solids (principally mucilage) in solin seed {{were determined to}} be 10, 21, 57 and 11 %, respectively, by manual dissection of soaked seed. Endosperm/cotyledon contained 17. 4 and 81. 6 %, respectively, of the total seed oil, and 16. 3 and 75. 6 %, respectively, of the total seed protein. The testa and soluble solids fraction contained 24. 6 and 26. 3 %, respectively, of the total seed dietary fibre. The yield, composition and physicochemical characteristics of mucilage were influenced by both extraction temperature and alcohol precipitation. Ethanol and isopropanol were equally suitable for mucilage precipitation. A prototype, wet dehulling system was developed. The system consisted of a blender, with its blades covered with latex tubing, in which degummed solin seed was slurried in water. Optimum dehulling conditions resulted in the recovery of 75 % of the testa, {{and a loss of}} 8 % of endosperm/cotyledon in the hull fraction. Extraction of oil from dehulled solin presscake with azeotropic isopropanol was slower than with hexane. Isopropanol-extractedmeal was lower in total lipid and lighter in colour than hexane extracted meal. Optimum azeotropic isopropanol oil extraction conditions resulted in an oil recovery of 96 %, with less than 2 % oil in the alcohol phase after chilling of <b>miscella.</b> Isopropanol recovered by chilling was suitable for precipitation of mucilage. Studies on aqueous extraction of oil from dehulled seed were discontinued due to the high residual oil content in meal and the formation of a stable oil-water emulsion. Concentrated protein products were prepared from azeotropic-isopropanol-extracted and hexane extracted solin meal by alkali extraction and acid and aqueous alcohol washing. The aqueous alcohol effluent from mucilage precipitation was suitable for use in the production of protein products. None of the protein products contained 65 % or more of protein on a moisture-free basis. Protein products prepared by acid or aqueous alcohol washing were similar in functionality, but generally inferior to soy flour controls. Functionalities of solin hull and the hull fraction were similar to those of pea hull and wheat bran. Hydrocyanic acid, trypsin inhibitor and phytic acid were associated with endosperm/cotyledon and, therefore, present in higher concentration in dehulled seed than in the hull fraction. The opposite was true for phenolics. Concentrated protein products were lower in HCN, trypsin inhibitor and phenolics compared to oil-free meals, but were enriched in phytic acid...|$|E
