40|$|Although {{there have}} been a few reports that the HIV- 1 genome can be {{selectively}} integrated into the genomic DNA of cultured host cell, the biochemistry of integration selectivity has not been fully understood. We modified the in vitro integration reaction protocol and developed a reaction system with higher efficiency. We used a substrate repeat, 5 '-(GTCCCTTCCCAGT) (n) (ACTGGGAAGGGAC) (n) - 3 ', and a modified sequence DNA ligated into a circular plasmid. CAGT and ACTG (shown in italics in the above sequence) in the repeat units originated from the HIV- 1 proviral genome ends. Following the incubation of the HIV- 1 genome end cDNA and recombinant integrase for the formation of the pre-integration (PI) complex, substrate DNA was reacted with this complex. It was confirmed that the integration selectively occurred in the middle segment of the repeat sequence. In addition, integration frequency and selectivity were positively correlated with repeat number n. On the other hand, both frequency and selectivity decreased markedly when using sequences with deletion of CAGT in the middle position of the original target sequence. Moreover, on incubation with the deleted DNAs and original sequence, the integration efficiency and selectivity for the original target sequence were significantly reduced, which indicated interference effects by the deleted sequence DNAs. Efficiency and selectivity were also found to vary discontinuously with changes in <b>manganese</b> <b>dichloride</b> concentration in the reaction buffer, probably due to its influence on the secondary structure of substrate DNA. Finally, integrase was found to form oligomers on the binding site and substrate DNA formed a loop-like structure. In conclusion, there is a considerable selectivity in HIV-integration into the specified sequence; however, similar DNA sequences can interfere with the integration process, and it is therefore difficult for in vivo integration to occur selectively in the actual host genome DNA...|$|E
40|$|The synthesis, {{electronic}} {{structures and}} reactivity of bis(imino) pyridine iron and manganese complexes were investigated. A series of dimeric bis(imino) pyridine iron dinitrogen compounds was prepared {{by reduction of}} the corresponding iron dihalide complexes with sodium naphthalenide. The dinitrogen compounds were shown to have electronic structures similar to the monomeric bis(imino) pyridine iron bis(dinitrogen) compound, (iPrPDI) Fe(N 2). Evaluation of the catalytic olefin hydrogenation activity of the new dinitrogen compounds revealed a significant improvement in rate over (iPrPDI) Fe(N 2), which was attributed to the smaller substituents on the bis(imino) pyridine aryl groups. The reactivity of the bis(imino) pyridine iron dinitrogen compounds with diazoalkanes was investigated. For all of the iron dinitrogen compounds, diazoalkane N-N bond cleavage was observed with monosubstituted diazoalkanes. Addition of diphenyldiazomethane to smaller bis(imino) pyridine iron dinitrogen compounds furnished bis(imino) pyridine iron carbene complexes. A combination of 1 H NMR, MÃ¶ssbauer and X-ray absorption spectroscopies, SQUID magnetometry and X-ray diffraction was used to propose several possible electronic structures for the bis(imino) pyridine iron carbene complexes. The spectroscopic data most strongly supported an electronic structure having an intermediate spin iron(III) center and a one-electron reduced bis(imino) pyridine chelate. The bis(imino) pyridine iron carbene complexes underwent carbene transfer to carbon monoxide and aryl azides, but not cyclopropanation or olefin metathesis reactions. The bis(imino) pyridine iron dinitrogen compounds were also found to be competent catalysts for carbon-carbon bond forming catalysis. Addition of ethylene to butadiene {{in the presence of}} 5 mol% iron catalyst resulted in a [2 [pi] + 2 [pi]] cycloaddition to furnish vinylcyclobutane, while addition of ethylene to isoprene under the same conditions resulted in 1, 4 hydrovinylation to yield 5 -methyl- 1, 4 -hexadiene. Under similar reaction conditions, [(MePDI) Fe(N 2) ] 2 ([mu] 2 -N 2) also catalyzed the cycloisomerization of 1, 5 -hexadiene. Finally, syntheses of variations of the bis(imino) pyridine iron dinitrogen compounds were investigated. Reduction of a bis(aldimino) pyridine iron dibromide did not afford an iron dinitrogen compound, but instead gave a diiron compound. Modeling variable temperature SQUID data for this compound provided experimental evidence for the redox activity of the bis(aldimino) pyridine ligand. The reduction of a bis(imino) pyridine <b>manganese</b> <b>dichloride</b> also did not afford a dinitrogen complex, but instead resulted in a bis(tetrahydrofuran) compound...|$|E
