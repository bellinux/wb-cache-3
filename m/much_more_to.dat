5|$|The ITS-Davis {{study also}} found that a small but {{influential}} minority of dealers have introduced new approaches to better meet the needs of plug-in customers. Examples include marketing carpool lane stickers, enrolling buyers in charging networks, and preparing incentive paperwork for customers. Some dealers assign seasoned sales people as plug-in experts, many of whom drive plug-ins themselves to learn and be familiar with the technology and relate the car’s benefits to potential buyers. The study concluded also that carmakers could do <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> support dealers selling PEVs.|$|E
5|$|Allen and {{his family}} moved to Burlington in 1787, which was no longer a small {{frontier}} settlement but a small town, and <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> Allen's liking than the larger community that Bennington had become. He frequented the tavern there, and began work on An Essay on the Universal Plenitude of Being, which he characterized as an appendix to Reason. This essay was less polemic than many of his earlier writings. He affirmed the perfection of God and His creation, and credited intuition as well as reason as a way to bring Man closer to the universe. The work was not published until long after his death, and is primarily of interest to students of Transcendentalism, a movement the work foreshadows.|$|E
5|$|Pick {{wanted a}} new type of {{building}} for the more open sites of the stations on the Piccadilly line's extensions. To decide what this new type should look like, he and Holden made a short tour of Germany, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands in July and August 1930 to see the latest developments in modern architecture. Pick was disappointed with much of the new architecture that he saw in Germany and Sweden, considering it either too extreme or unsatisfactorily experimental. The architecture in the Netherlands was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> his liking, particularly buildings by Willem Marinus Dudok in Hilversum. Although the architecture in Denmark was not considered remarkable, Pick was impressed with the way in which designers there were often responsible for all elements of a building including the interior fixtures and fittings.|$|E

5|$|Reflecting the {{tendency}} in the Third Reich to have several rival agencies {{operating in the}} same field, {{a number of new}} organizations emerged in the diplomatic field that competed with the Auswärtiges Amt. The most important of the rivals of the Auswärtiges Amt was the Dienststelle Ribbentrop, which was the rival foreign office headed by Joachim von Ribbentrop that operated its own foreign policy in direct competition with the Auswärtiges Amt. Neurath favored a pro-Chinese policy whereas Ribbentrop favored a pro-Japanese policy. In the summer of 1935, Ribbentrop and his friend, the Japanese military attache to Germany General Hiroshi Ōshima, {{came up with a plan}} to square the circle between Germany having to choose between Japan or China, and bring China into the Japanese sphere of influence by devising a plan for anti-Communist alliance that would unite Germany, China and Japan together. This was the origin of what become the Anti-Comintern Pact, but the Ribbentrop-Ōshima plan was vetoed in November 1935 jointly by the Foreign Minister Konstantin von Neurath and by the War Minister Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg , who told Hitler that the Chinese would never join this proposed alliance, and that on economic grounds China had <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> offer Germany than did Japan.|$|E

25|$|There was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> {{construction}} {{than simply}} building the dam. Several railroads, roads and bridges, utility lines and cemeteries were relocated. The largest of these jobs was the rerouting of six miles (10km) of the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway.

25|$|Banks, {{telephone}} service companies, Internet service providers, pay TV companies, insurance firms, and alarm monitoring services, often use customer attrition analysis and customer attrition rates {{as one of}} their key business metrics (along with cash flow, EBITDA, etc.) because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one. Companies from these sectors often have customer service branches which attempt to win back defecting clients, because recovered long-term customers can be worth <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> a company than newly recruited clients.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the penitentiary}} cost <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> operate than other prisons (nearly $10 per {{prisoner}} per day, {{as opposed to}} $3 per prisoner per day at Atlanta), and {{half a century of}} salt water saturation had severely eroded the buildings, then Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy ordered the penitentiary closed on March 21, 1963. In addition, citizens were increasingly protesting the environmental effects of sewage released into San Francisco Bay from the approximately 250 inmates and 60 Bureau of Prisons families on the island. That year, the United States Penitentiary in Marion, Illinois, on land, opened as the replacement facility for Alcatraz.|$|E

25|$|The Epistle to a Friend {{concerning}} Poetry {{is neither}} startling nor contemptible; it has, in fact, <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> say than the rhymed treatises on verse by Roscommon and Buckinghamshire.

Much of its advice is cautious and commonplace—but {{such was the}} tradition of the poetical treatise on verse. Appearing within two years of Collier's first attack upon the stage, it reinforces some of that worthy's contentions, but we are not aware of its having had much effect.|$|E
25|$|An End to al-Qaeda: Destroying Bin Laden's Jihad and Restoring America's Honor is a non-fiction {{book about}} counterterrorism {{strategies}} towards al-Qaeda, written by U.S. Navy retired cryptology analyst Malcolm Nance.

Nance writes the United States should do <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> engage traditional believers in Islam around the world to denounce al-Qaeda through education and a public relations campaign.|$|E
25|$|The {{increasingly}} wealthy Merovingian elite endowed many monasteries, {{including that}} of the Irish missionary Columbanus. The 5th, 6th and 7th centuries saw two major waves of hermitism in the Frankish world, which led to legislation requiring that all monks and hermits follow the Rule of St Benedict. The Church sometimes had an uneasy relationship with the Merovingian kings, whose claim to rule depended on a mystique of royal descent and who tended to revert to the polygamy of their pagan ancestors. Rome encouraged the Franks to slowly replace the Gallican Rite with the Roman rite. When the mayors took over, the Church was supportive and an Emperor crowned by the Pope was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> their liking.|$|E

25|$|If it were {{possible}} for the working classes, by combining among themselves, to raise or keep up the general rate of wages, it needs hardly be said {{that this would be}} a thing not to be punished, but to be welcomed and rejoiced at. Unfortunately the effect is quite beyond attainment by such means. The multitudes who compose the working class are too numerous and too widely scattered to combine at all, <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> combine effectually. If they could do so, they might doubtless succeed in diminishing the hours of labour, and obtaining the same wages for less work. They would also have a limited power of obtaining, by combination, an increase of general wages at the expense of profits.|$|E
25|$|Pedro de Mendoza, on {{whom the}} country was next bestowed, founded Buenos Aires, but did not venture south. Alonzo de Camargo (1539), Juan Ladrilleros (1557) and Hurtado de Mendoza (1558) helped to make known the Pacific coasts, and while Sir Francis Drake's voyage in 1577 down the Atlantic coast, through the Strait of Magellan and northward along the Pacific coast was memorable, yet the {{descriptions}} of the geography of Patagonia owe <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> the Spanish explorer Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa (1579–1580), who, devoting himself especially to the south-west region, made careful and accurate surveys. The settlements which he founded at Nombre de Dios and San Felipe were neglected by the Spanish government, the latter being abandoned before Thomas Cavendish visited it in 1587 and so desolate that he called it Port Famine. After {{the discovery of the}} route around Cape Horn the Spanish Crown lost interest in southern Patagonia until the eighteenth century when the coastal settlements Carmen de Patagones, San José, Puerto Deseado, and Nueva Colonia Floridablanca were established, although it maintained its claim of a de jure sovereignty over area.|$|E
