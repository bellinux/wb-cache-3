5|$|Early filters {{utilised}} {{the phenomenon}} of resonance to filter signals. Although electrical resonance had been investigated by researchers from a very early stage, it was at first not widely understood by electrical engineers. Consequently, the much <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> concept of acoustic resonance (which in turn, can be {{explained in terms of}} the even <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> mechanical resonance) found its way into filter design ahead of electrical resonance. Resonance can be used to achieve a filtering effect because the resonant device will respond to frequencies at, or near, to the resonant frequency but will not respond to frequencies far from resonance. Hence frequencies far from resonance are filtered out from the output of the device.|$|E

5|$|By 1891, Marsh {{published}} a <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> view of Stegosaurus, {{with a single}} row of plates. This was dropped fairly early on (apparently because it was poorly understood how the plates were embedded in the skin and they were thought to overlap too much in this arrangement). It was revived, in somewhat modified form, in the 1980s, by Stephen Czerkas, based on the arrangement of iguana dorsal spines.|$|E

Rhondda Gazette was in circulation from 1913 to 1919 while the Rhondda Clarion was available in the late 1930s.|$|E

5|$|Barry's scheme {{provided}} two plinths for sculptures on {{the north}} side of the square. A bronze equestrian statue of George IV by Sir Francis Chantrey, originally intended to be placed on top of the Marble Arch, was installed on the eastern plinth in 1844, while the other remained empty until the late-20th century. There are two other statues on plinths, both installed during the 19th century: General Sir Charles James Napier by George Cannon Adams in the south-west corner in 1855, and Major-General Sir Henry Havelock by William Behnes in the south-east in 1861. In 2000, the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, suggested replacing the statues with figures <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> to the general public.|$|E

It {{was the first in}} a series of changes which included dropping Sunderland from the title in 1990, the paper simply becoming The Echo. This change was reversed in 1997, with a return to the name Sunderland Echo.|$|E
