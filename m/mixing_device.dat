The main objectives of this analysis {{is to establish a}} proper CFD analysis methodology to this kind of very complicated turbulent swirling flow in a subchannel since previous results show that a predicted turbulent swirl flow within 5 times of hydraulic diameter length from the <b>mixing</b> <b>devices</b> tip shows different results, which are dependent on the models chosen, such as the turbulent model, wall function model, the y+ value, and the numerical model for a convection term. In the MATIS-H experiment, the intrinsic features of turbulent flow along the elevation, which shows distinct characteristics very sensitively by depending on the types of the <b>mixing</b> <b>devices</b> (split and swirl types), were measured by 2 -D LDA (Laser Doppler Anemometry) at the condition of Re= 48, 000 in the water loop being operated at 35 o C and 1. 5 bar. A series of sensitivity analyses shows that a very dense mesh distribution along the stream-wise direction around the <b>mixing</b> <b>devices</b> is recommended to use for resolving a drastic change of the turbulent intensity due to a strong swirl flow induced by the <b>mixing</b> <b>devices.</b> And it is also shown that a non-linear or secondorder closure model is required to adopt for properly predicting the anisotropic characteristics of the turbulent flow structures caused by the <b>mixing</b> <b>devices</b> in the sub-channel. 1...|$|R

40|$|Detailed {{turbulent}} flow profiles have been {{measured on a}} square sub-channel geometry with typical <b>mixing</b> <b>devices.</b> For a fine examination of the lateral flow structure on a sub-channel geometry with 2 -D LDA, a 5 x 5 rod bundle array was fabricated as 2. 6 {{times larger than the}} real bundle size.

The correct inhalation manoeuvre differs markedly for different inhaler types. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare outcomes for patients prescribed the same inhaler <b>device</b> versus <b>mixed</b> <b>device</b> types for asthma controller and reliever therapy. Methods: This retrospective observational study identified patients with asthma (ages 4 - 80 years) in a large primary care database who were prescribed an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) for the first time. We compared outcomes for patients prescribed the same breath-actuated inhaler (BAI) for ICS controller and salbutamol reliever versus <b>mixed</b> <b>devices</b> (BAI for controller and pressurised metered-dose inhaler [pMDI] for reliever). The 2 -year study included 1 baseline year before the ICS prescription (to identify and correct for confounding factors) and 1 outcome year. Endpoints were asthma control (defined as no hospital attendance for asthma, oral corticosteroids, or antibiotics for lower respiratory tract infection) and severe exacerbations (hospitalisation or oral corticosteroids for asthma). Results: Patients prescribed the same device (n= 3, 428) were significantly more likely to achieve asthma control (adjusted odds ratio, 1. 15; 95 % confidence interval [Cl], 1. 02 - 1. 28) and recorded significantly lower severe exacerbation rates (adjusted rate ratio, 0. 79; 95 % Cl. 0. 68 - 0. 93) than those prescribed <b>mixed</b> <b>devices</b> (n= 5, 452).

50|$|A stopped-flow {{instrument}} is a rapid <b>mixing</b> <b>device</b> {{used to study}} the chemical kinetics of fast reactions in solution. In stopped-flow technique, the solutions are forced from syringes into a mixing chamber. After {{a very short period}} of flow, perhaps a few ms, the flow is stopped suddenly when the observation cell is filled by an opposing piston that is linked to a sensing switch that triggers the measuring device. Small volumes of solutions are used, and the kinetic equations for modeling the reactions are equivalent to those used in conventional methods in which concentration and time are measured. Stopped-flow is useful for studying fast reactions that have half-lives as short as a few milliseconds.|$|E

5000|$|Above {{the range}} of {{frequency}} counters, frequencies of electromagnetic signals are often measured indirectly by means of heterodyning (frequency conversion). A reference signal of a known frequency near the unknown frequency is mixed with the unknown frequency in a nonlinear <b>mixing</b> <b>device</b> such as a diode. This creates a heterodyne or [...] "beat" [...] signal at {{the difference between the}} two frequencies. If the two signals are close together in frequency the heterodyne is low enough to be measured by a frequency counter.

Current research is extending this method to infrared and light frequencies (optical heterodyne detection).|$|E
