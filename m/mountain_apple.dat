500|$|Daniel Ho was {{disappointed}} by the category's retirement, but considered the seven years the award was presented a [...] "gift from the Recording Academy". Ho hoped that the category's elimination would eliminate the [...] "craziness" [...] surrounding the Hawaiian music controversy (he and Carrere were accused of lacking appreciation for Hawaiian music and for having inside connections to the music industry by residing in Los Angeles). Four-time award winner George Kahumoku, Jr. expressed similar disappointment, but was partly consoled {{by the fact that}} Hawaiian music recordings would still be included in the Regional Roots Music Album category. The record label <b>Mountain</b> <b>Apple</b> Company issued a statement claiming: [...] "Hawaiian music deserves to be acknowledged as a category in its own right, not only for reasons of language but for cultural and historical reasons as well... The loss of the Grammy for Best Hawaiian Music Album is not only a major loss to the Hawaiian, but to music lovers across the globe". Michael Cord of HanaOla Records was also saddened by the elimination, but considered it [...] "a long time coming". Hawaiian music works will now be eligible for the Best Regional Roots Music Album category.|$|E
500|$|Nominees for the 47th Grammy Awards (2005) included: The Brothers Cazimero for Some Call It Aloha... Don't Tell, {{producer}} Charles M. Brotman for Slack Key Guitar: Volume 2, Ho'okena for Cool Elevation, Amy Hanaialiʻi Gilliom, and arranger and multi-instrumentalist Willie K. (born William Kahaialiʻi) for Amy & Willie Live, and Kealiʻi Reichel for Keʻalaokamaile. Hanaialiʻi and Reichel both expressed happiness {{at being}} nominated, the latter stating, [...] "This is {{the culmination of}} the work of chanters, singers and poetry writers that dates back over a thousand years." [...] One NPR contributor wrote that the nominees illustrated the range of Hawaiian music at the time, [...] "from traditional songs for guitar and ukulele to more modernized approaches". Some Call It Aloha... Don't Tell contained traditional Hawaiian folk songs and chants and the use of traditional instruments such as the acoustic bass and 12-string guitar. Hoʻokena members Many Boyd, Horache K. Dudoit III, Chris Kamaka and Glen H.K. Smith created music for Cool Elevation using the ukulele, acoustic bass, and guitar. Scott Iwasaki of the Deseret News described Amy & Willie Live as a [...] "playful array of Hawaiian jazz". Ke'alaokamaile, a concept album about Reichel's immediate ancestors, combines traditional Hawaiian chants with original songs. The album also included contemporary covers of Babyface's [...] "You Were There", Karla Bonoff's [...] "Goodbye My Friend", and Sting's [...] "Fields of Gold". The award went to Brotman for the slack key guitar compilation album recorded in Hawaii and described by journalist Nate Chinen as [...] "an easy-listening instrumental compilation seemingly tailored to mainland tastes". According to Jon de Mello, founder of Hawaiian record label <b>Mountain</b> <b>Apple</b> Company, other nominees' [...] "jaws dropped on the ground" [...] at the ceremony in reaction to their works being overlooked. Chinen claimed the Academy's [...] "safe, bland" [...] choice set a precedent for compilations and slack key use (five nominees the following year were slack key albums).|$|E

I have drunk the cocoanuts of Jamaica and of Hawaii, but I never knew how delicious such draught could be till I drank it here in the Marquesas. Occasionally we rode under wild limes and oranges--great trees which had survived the wilderness longer than the motes of humans who had cultivated them.|$|R

Several of the earliest stars of stock-car racing in the 1940s and 1950s got their start in the moonshining business in the Brushy Mountains.
