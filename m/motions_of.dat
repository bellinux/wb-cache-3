5|$|The first civilization {{known to}} have a {{functional}} theory of the planets were the Babylonians, who lived in Mesopotamia {{in the first and}} second millennia BC. The oldest surviving planetary astronomical text is the Babylonian Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa, a 7th-century BC copy of a list of observations of the <b>motions</b> <b>of</b> the planet Venus, that probably dates as early as the second millennium BC. The MUL.APIN is a pair of cuneiform tablets dating from the 7th century BC that lays out the <b>motions</b> <b>of</b> the Sun, Moon, and planets {{over the course of the}} year. The Babylonian astrologers also laid the foundations of what would eventually become Western astrology. The Enuma anu enlil, written during the Neo-Assyrian period in the 7th century BC, comprises a list of omens and their relationships with various celestial phenomena including the <b>motions</b> <b>of</b> the planets. Venus, Mercury, and the outer planets Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn were all identified by Babylonian astronomers. These would remain the only known planets until the invention of the telescope in early modern times.|$|E

5|$|Later Greek philosophers, {{observing the}} <b>motions</b> <b>of</b> the heavenly bodies, were {{concerned}} with developing models of the Universe-based more profoundly on empirical evidence.

5|$|Near {{the end of}} {{the twelfth}} century, the Spanish Muslim {{astronomer}} al-Bitrūjī (Alpetragius) sought to explain the complex <b>motions</b> <b>of</b> the planets without Ptolemy's epicycles and eccentrics, using an Aristotelian framework of purely concentric spheres that moved with differing speeds from east to west.

40|$|Abstract — One of the {{potential}} benefits of robotic systems in cardiac surgery is that their use can increase the number of possible off-pump (beating heart) coronary artery bypass grafting procedures. Robotic systems can actively synchronize the <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> surgical tools to the <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> the surface of the heart, with the surgeon specifying only the relative <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> the tool with respect to the heart. Accurate prediction <b>of</b> the <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> the heart surface is obviously of crucial importance for the safety and robustness of such a system. This paper presents a novel approach to predict the <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> the surface of a beating heart. We show how ECG and respiratory information can be used to extract two periodic components from the quasi-periodic <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> the heart surface. Contrary to most existing literature, we consider the full geometric motion, including rotation due to respiration. We then show how to combine the periodic components to accurately predict future <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> the heart surface, and how this information can be used to design an explicit controller that asymptotically stabilizes the relative <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> the surgical tool to a desired relative distance and orientation.
