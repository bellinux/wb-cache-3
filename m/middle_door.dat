The front facade, which faces southwest today, is adorned with three doorways—left, right, and center— which span a front porch beneath the bell tower. When the school was open, {{the use of the}} doors was restricted. The left and right doors were used by boys in first through eighth grades while the <b>middle</b> <b>door</b> was earmarked as an entry for girls of all ages. Each of the doors feature transoms topped with cornices.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the Second World War Oslo Sporveier had a {{fleet of}} 331 trams, of which only the 46 Gullfisk trams were modern bogie-constructions. The {{remaining}} were twin-axle and limited in capacity. Oslo Sporveier needed more and newer matériel and considered several options. More Gullfisk were considered, but their aluminum bodies were found to be unsuitable, they had issues with cracks in the bogies and their electrical system was prone to faults. They were design with entrance through the <b>middle</b> <b>door,</b> which had during the high usage during the war proven to be inefficient and often led to two conductors being needed for each car. By then flow-through units with a stationary conductor had become common. There were also significant developments within controllers and 300-volt motors. As such additional orders for Gullfisk were discarded.|$|E

2500|$|Entrance to {{the church}} was through three large doors that opened into a high, spacious {{vestibule}} with circular stairways {{on the right and}} left that led to the upstairs gallery or balcony. [...] Directly across from the center entrance was the <b>middle</b> <b>door</b> into the high, square, well-lit sanctuary that for many years was an unpainted white. The balcony that ran around three sides of the sanctuary was supported by wooden posts with the broad center isle leading {{to the front of the}} sanctuary where the old wooden pulpit was hung. [...] The pulpit, supported by two Corinthian pillars of wood, was surmounted by a crimson cushion and was quite an imposing structure. [...] A high crimson curtain hung behind the pulpit arranged in a row of straight folds or [...] "flutes", like the pipes of a great organ topped with a straight lambrequin of the same material. [...] The pulpit had doors on either side, similar to those in the pews below, from which the minister entered. [...] Opposite the pulpit in the gallery was the choir loft, this opened from a large room that was directly over the vestibule where the choir practiced, and instruments were tuned.|$|E

6000|$|Miriam {{entered the}} place with her charming {{familiar}} grandeur--entered very much as she might have appeared, as she appeared every night, early in her first act, {{at the back of}} the stage, by the immemorial <b>middle</b> <b>door.</b> She might exactly now have been presenting herself to the house, taking easy possession, repeating old movements, looking from one to the other of the actors before the footlights. The rich [...] "Good-morning" [...] she threw into the air, holding out her right hand to Biddy and then giving her left to Nick--as she might have given it to her own brother--had nothing to tell of intervals or alienations. She struck Biddy as still more terrible in her splendid practice than when she had seen her before--the practice and the splendour had now something almost royal. The girl had had occasion to make her curtsey to majesties and highnesses, but the flutter those effigies produced was nothing to the way in which at the approach of this young lady the agitated air seemed to recognise something supreme. So the deep mild eyes she bent on Biddy were not soothing, though for that matter evidently intended to soothe. Biddy wondered Nick could have got so used to her--he joked at her as she loomed--and later in the day, still under the great impression of this incident, she even wondered that Peter could have full an impunity. It was true that Peter apparently didn't quite feel one.|$|E

50|$|The T2SUs were T2 {{cars that}} were {{delivered}} to the Soviet Union, hence the suffix -SU. The cars differed from the Czechoslovak version, particularly by {{the removal of the}} <b>middle</b> <b>door,</b> making room for more seats. The fare-collection system in most of the Soviet Union maintained that all people pay for their ride, thus the requirement for passengers to board from the rear door and depart from the front door. Removal of the <b>middle</b> <b>door</b> was hence required by contractors in order to avoid free-riders. The last T2SUs were withdrawn from service in the 1980s. In total, 380 T2SU cars were {{delivered to the}} Soviet Union.|$|E
50|$|The Interborough Rapid Transit Company's first {{cars were}} built {{with only two}} doors on each side, at the extreme ends of the car, lining up with the curved {{platforms}} {{so as not to}} leave a wide gap between the train and the platform. When the IRT modified existing cars and ordered new cars with a <b>middle</b> <b>door,</b> gap fillers were needed because the <b>middle</b> <b>door</b> was not near the platform. After the City of New York bought the IRT in 1940, new car designs (starting with the R12) had the end doors away from the extreme ends of the carbody, which also required the use of gap fillers at certain stations.|$|E

50|$|Drögmöller didn't only produce pure touring coaches. In 1997 they {{introduced}} the Volvo B10-400, a intercity bus {{based on the}} Carrus Vega developed in Finland. As the name suggests, it was not built on the B12, but on the B10B and B10M chassis. The B10-400 was available {{in at least three}} different versions: B10-400 K/860, B10-400 K/1040 and B10-400 M/NFH. The K/860 and the K/1040 were based on the B10B and the numbers represent their floor height in millimetres. The K/860 had double <b>middle</b> <b>door</b> (1-2-0), while the K/1040 only had a single <b>middle</b> <b>door</b> (1-1-0). The M/NFH was based on the B10M and had a low-floor bay at the rear end, with a double rear door and no <b>middle</b> <b>door</b> (1-0-2). There was also a B10B-based B10-400 IC, but except from allowing more standing passengers, little is known about its characteristics. The Vega was also available from Poland under the name Volvo 7250, from 2000 also available on the B7R chassis. It is possible that some buses sold as B10-400 were built in Poland. In 2001, the B10-400 was replaced by the Volvo 8700, built in Poland and Finland.|$|E
