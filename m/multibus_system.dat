40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} the various configurations of a multilevel modular capacitor-clamped converter (MMCCC), and it reveals many useful and new formations {{of the original}} MMCCC for transferring power in either an isolated or nonisolated manner. The various features of the original MMCCC circuit are best suited for a <b>multibus</b> <b>system</b> in future plug-in hybrid or fuel-cell-powered vehicles ’ drive train. The original MMCCC is capable of bidirectional power transfer using multilevel modular structure with capacitor-clamped topology. It has a nonisolated structure, and it offers very high efficiency even at partial loads. This circuit was modified to integrate single or multiple high-frequency trans-formers by using the intermediate voltage nodes of the converter. On the other hand, a special formation of the MMCCC can exhibit dc outputs offering limited isolation without using any isolation transformer. This modified version can produce a high conversion ratio from {{a limited number of}} components and has several useful applications in providing power to multiple low-voltage loads in a hybrid or electric automobile. This paper will investigate the origin of generating ac outputs from the MMCCC and shows how the transformer-free version can be modified to create limited isolation from the circuit. In addition, this paper will compare var-ious modified forms of the MMCCC topology with existing dc–dc converter circuits from compactness and component utilization perspectives. Index Terms—Fuel-cell vehicle, isolated dc–dc converter, multi-level dc–dc converter, multilevel modular capacitor-clamped converter (MMCCC), plug-in hybrid vehicle. I...|$|E
50|$|A port {{to support}} <b>Multibus</b> Sun-2 <b>systems</b> in NetBSD was begun in January 2001 from the Sun-3 {{support in the}} NetBSD 1.5 release. Code {{supporting}} the Sun-2 began to be merged into the NetBSD tree in April 2001. sun2 is considered a tier 2 support platform as of NetBSD 7.0.1.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concentrates}} on the design and analysis of a controller for <b>multibus</b> microgrid <b>system.</b> The controller proposed for use with each distributed generation (DG) system in the microgrid contains inner voltage and current loops for regulating the three-phase grid-interfacing inverter, and external power control loops for controlling real and reactive power flow and for facilitating power sharing between the paralleled DG systems when a utility fault occurs and the microgrid islands. The controller also incorporates synchronization algorithms for ensuring smooth and safe reconnection of the micro and utility grids when the fault is cleared. With {{the implementation of the}} unified controller, the <b>multibus</b> microgrid <b>system</b> is able to switch between islanding and grid-connected modes without disrupting the critical loads connected to it. The performance of this unified controller has been verified in simulation using a real-time digital simulator and experimentally using a scaled laboratory prototype...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} new concept in {{developing}} outline and asses strategic business and technology aspects of cloud computing. Theoretical background and overview is presented on the basic underlying principles autonomic and utility computing, Service oriented Architecture. This configuration(MC-UPQC), capable of simultaneous compensation for voltage and current in <b>multibus</b> <b>systems.</b> In this configuration, one shunt voltage-source converter (shunt VSC) and two or more series VSCs exist. The system {{can be applied to}} adjacent feeders to compensate for supply-voltage and load current imperfections on the main feeder and full compensation of supply voltage imperfections on the other feeders. The power can be transferred from one feeder to adjacent feeders to compensate for sag/swell and interruption. The performance of the proposed configuration has been verified through simulation studies using MATLAB/SIMULATION on a two-bus/two-feeder system and results are presented. Ultimately, I conclude with an outlook and recommendations for companies and cloud providers...|$|R

50|$|The oldest {{commonly}} used field bus technology is Bitbus. Bitbus {{was created by}} Intel Corporation to enhance use of <b>Multibus</b> <b>systems</b> in industrial systems by separating slow i/o functions from faster memory access. In 1983, Intel created the 8044 Bitbus microcontroller by adding field bus firmware to its existing 8051 microcontroller. Bitbus uses EIA-485 at the physical layer, with two twisted pairs - one for data {{and the other for}} clocking and signals. Use of SDLC at the data link layer permits 250 nodes on one segment with a total distance of 13.2 km. Bitbus has one master node and multiple slaves, with slaves only responding to requests from the master. Bitbus does not define routing at the network layer. The 8044 permits only a relatively small data packet (13 bytes), but embeds an efficient set of RAC (remote access and control) tasks and the ability to develop custom RAC tasks. In 1990, the IEEE adopted Bitbus as the Microcontroller System Serial Control Bus (IEEE-1118).|$|R

40|$|A {{control system}} for a multi-motor system such as a space telerobot, having a remote {{computational}} node and a local computational node interconnected with one another by a high speed data link is described. A Universal Computer Control System (UCCS) for the telerobot is located at each node. Each node is provided with a <b>multibus</b> computer <b>system</b> which {{is characterized by a}} plurality of processors with all processors being connected to a common bus, and including at least one command processor. The command processor communicates over the bus with a plurality of joint controller cards. A plurality of direct current torque motors, of the type used in telerobot joints and telerobot hand-held controllers, are connected to the controller cards and responds to digital control signals from the command processor. Essential motor operating parameters are sensed by analog sensing circuits and the sensed analog signals are converted to digital signals for storage at the controller cards where such signals can be read during an address read/write cycle of the command processing processor...|$|R
40|$|The {{procedure}} for calculating controller {{parameters of the}} APFs implemented into a <b>multibus</b> industrial power <b>system</b> for harmonic voltage mitigation is presented. The node-voltage-detection control strategy is applied and the basic controller parameters are found {{under the condition that}} the demanded THD factors at the buses where the APFs are placed will be obtained. A cooperative control of several APFs without mutual communication is proposed, simulated, and experimentally verified. By tuning the controller gains without considering the power circuit parameters, all APFs used tend to share harmonic load currents approximately equally regardless of the operation modes of the nonlinear loads {{in different parts of the}} power system...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} was to implement an alternative mapping realization of the hierarchical abstract simulator on the Intel <b>Multibus</b> 1 microprocessor <b>system.</b> Utilizing three 286 / 10 single board computers, integration of the M 286 monitor with the hierarchical abstract simulator algorithm and execution of the distributed simulator system (DSS) was studied. Seven experiments were done on the DSS showing that the DSS correctly executes the algorithm of the hierarchical abstract simulator. An additional benefit is that parallelism is achieved even without external input: one simulator executes the internal transition function, with other executing the external transition function. This system has demonstrated that the hierarchical abstract simulator concept can be implemented on present-day, available hardware...|$|R
5000|$|Multibus-II {{hardware}} {{running the}} iRMX operating system {{is used in}} the majority of the core Automatic Train Supervision subsystems on CLSCS, the London Underground Central line Signals Control System. This was supplied by Westinghouse Rail Systems and commissioned from the mid-1990s. The Central line is an Automatic Train Operation line. The Automatic Train Supervision elements use a mixture of iRMX on Multibus, and Solaris on SPARC computers. Sixteen Multibus-based Local Site Computers are distributed along the line together with six central Multibus-based subsystems in the control centre. Real time control and communications functions are provided by the Multibus-based processors and Sun workstations provide database functions and the operator consoles in the control room. All subsystem computers are dual redundant. The safety-critical Automatic Train Protection component is provided by trackside and train-borne equipment that does not use <b>Multibus.</b> The <b>system</b> was still in full operation [...] In the control centre, Westinghouse also provided a cut-down mimic of the system for staff training and software test purposes using much of the same hardware and software as the full ATS system, but connected to a computer (also Multibus-II and Sun based) to simulate train movements and signalling behaviour.|$|R
5000|$|The Multibus {{specification}} {{was important}} {{because it was a}} robust, well-thought out industry standard with a relatively large form factor, so complex devices could be designed on it. Because it was a well-defined and well-documented industry standard, it allowed a Multibus-compatible industry to grow around it, with many companies making card cages and enclosures for it. Many others made CPU, memory, and other peripheral boards. In 1982 there were over 100 <b>Multibus</b> board and <b>systems</b> manufacturers. [...] This allowed complex systems to be built from commercial off-the-shelf hardware, and also allowed companies to innovate by designing a proprietary Multibus board and then integrating it with other vendors' hardware to create a system. A good example of this was Sun Microsystems with their Sun 1 and Sun 2 workstations. Sun built custom-designed CPU, memory, SCSI, and video display boards, and then added 3Com Ethernet networking boards, Xylogics SMD disk controllers, Ciprico Tapemaster 1/2 inch tape controllers, Sky Floating Point Processor, and Systech 16-port Terminal Interfaces in order to configure the system as a workstation or a file server. Other workstation vendors who used Multibus-based designs included HP/Apollo and Silicon Graphics IRIS.|$|R
