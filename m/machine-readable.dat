5|$|As of November 24, 2015 all {{citizens}} that possess the burgundy red Lebanese passport must submit {{them to the}} Lebanese Directorate General of General Security (DGGS) or at any Lebanese embassy {{as well as any}} of the various diplomatic missions and consulates of the Republic of Lebanon abroad. These passports will no longer be valid since they are not <b>machine-readable.</b> The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has decided that November 24, 2015 will be the deadline to implement the use of <b>machine-readable</b> passports only in travel through airports. Those who possess the red Lebanese passport must apply for the navy blue (<b>machine-readable)</b> passport as soon as possible.|$|E
5|$|There are 48 {{pages in}} the current <b>machine-readable</b> navy blue passport. Frequent {{travelers}} may request 52-page passports for no additional cost. Extra visa pages can be added by mail (if the passport holder resides in the Republic of Lebanon) and at most diplomatic missions and consulates of the Republic of Lebanon abroad (if the passport holder resides or visits a country overseas). The addition of visa pages used to be free, but as of July 13, 2010, the non-refundable application fee for 24 or 48 additional pages costs 120,000 Lebanese Pounds or 80 US Dollars.|$|E
25|$|On May 1, 1995, green covers were instituted on regular {{passports}} for {{the first}} time, and barcodes were inserted in passports in 2004. The new security-enhanced passport is a prerequisite to the issuance of new <b>machine-readable</b> passports which was first issued to the public on September 17, 2007. The Philippines {{used to be one}} of the few countries in the world that had not yet issue <b>machine-readable</b> regular passports although <b>machine-readable</b> passports for public officials have been issued since June 18, 2007.|$|E
25|$|The <b>machine-readable</b> {{passport}} {{is designed}} to prevent tampering {{through the use of}} a special features embedded in the passport cover, similar to other <b>machine-readable</b> passports. It also has more pages than the previous passport (44 pages instead of the previous 32) and processing times were expected to be accelerated.|$|E

25|$|Over the years, {{a number}} of tools for {{analyzing}} and understanding systems described using CSP have been produced. Early tool implementations {{used a variety of}} <b>machine-readable</b> syntaxes for CSP, making input files written for different tools incompatible. However, most CSP tools have now standardized on the <b>machine-readable</b> dialect of CSP devised by Bryan Scattergood, sometimes referred to as CSPM. The CSPM dialect of CSP possesses a formally defined operational semantics, which includes an embedded functional programming language.|$|E
25|$|The {{name that}} appears in the <b>machine-readable</b> zone {{at the bottom of}} the visa {{represents}} the holder’s Cyrillic name mapped into the Roman alphabet. This allows Russian computer systems to read the Cyrillic name, despite the machine readers only being able to read Roman alphabet letters. As a result, the spelling of a name in the <b>machine-readable</b> zone does not necessarily reflect its spelling in the visa’s name field. For example, the name “Christoph” would appear in the field as “Kpиcтoф/Christoph”, but the MRZ would contain the name “Kristof”.|$|E
25|$|In its {{original}} interpretation, {{one of the}} first consequences of implementing the Internet of things by equipping all objects in the world with minuscule identifying devices or <b>machine-readable</b> identifiers would be to transform daily life.|$|E
25|$|The Russian visa is a <b>machine-readable</b> document, {{which is}} placed in the holder’s passport. All fields are {{indicated}} in both Russian and English, but are filled out only in Russian. The holder’s name appears in both the Roman and Cyrillic alphabets.|$|E
25|$|The Department of Foreign Affairs began issuing maroon <b>machine-readable</b> {{passports}} on September 17, 2007, and biometric passports on August 11, 2009. The green colored cover non-electronic passports {{are still}} valid until they expire. Philippine passports are printed at the APO Production Unit plant in Malvar, Batangas.|$|E
25|$|The <b>machine-readable</b> zone {{is present}} {{at the bottom of}} the page and {{contains}} P<<<<<<<<<<<< in the first line and USA< in the second line. Both lines contain 44 characters in a fixed-width all-caps font, with the top line ending with enough left angle brackets to fill the 44 character limit.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, {{the first}} version of <b>machine-readable</b> {{passports}} (MRP) was issued, in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organization standards. An amended version came into circulation in 1991, with additional security features and more stringent processing requirements. By 1993, a newer version of MRP was introduced, which contained unique features to prevent replication or alteration.|$|E
25|$|Officials {{from the}} DFA have {{clarified}} that the older, green, non-MRP passports will expire as scheduled on their original expiration dates. However, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) requires {{all member states}} to issue <b>machine-readable</b> passports by April 2010, hence some countries may deny entry to Filipinos still in possession of the green, hand-written passports.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to {{guidelines}} for <b>machine-readable</b> documents, the issuing country’s ISO code (RUS) is not shown at positions 3-5 (i.e. V). Instead, {{the first line}} is formatted as: VSURNAME<not necessarily printed on the visa (depending on the embassy), a photo is required in the visa application. The visa application form may be filled online and submitted to the diplomatic mission.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, the DFA in {{cooperation}} with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas started a five-year passport modernization project designed to issue new Philippine <b>machine-readable</b> passports (MRP). However, an injunction was issued against the project by a lower court, only to be overturned by the Supreme Court and ordering the DFA and the BSP to continue the project.|$|E
25|$|Travelers {{utilizing}} the program or the parole {{are required to}} complete an I-736 form, hold a <b>machine-readable</b> passport and nonrefundable return ticket, and {{are not permitted to}} travel onwards to the contiguous United States. Because of special visa categories for the Northern Mariana Islands foreign workers, traveling between Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands still requires a full immigration inspection, and all visitors departing Guam or Northern Mariana Islands are inspected regardless of final destination.|$|E
25|$|<b>Machine-readable</b> {{passports}} {{originally had}} no signature field, {{a source of}} much controversy as Filipinos applying for foreign visas, whether for travel or employment, have either been requested to {{get a copy of}} their passport application form to verify their signature, or denied altogether. Newer versions of this passport eventually had the signature field at the back cover, below the important reminders for Philippine passport holders, while older versions have the field stamped on.|$|E
25|$|This {{mechanism}} for describing resources {{is a major}} component in the W3C's Semantic Web activity: an evolutionary stage of the World Wide Web in which automated software can store, exchange, and use <b>machine-readable</b> information distributed throughout the Web, in turn enabling users {{to deal with the}} information with greater efficiency and certainty. RDF's simple data model and ability to model disparate, abstract concepts has also led to its increasing use in knowledge management applications unrelated to Semantic Web activity.|$|E
25|$|The legal {{driving force}} of {{biometric}} passports is the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002, which states that smart-card Identity cards {{may be used in}} lieu of visas. That law also provides that foreigners who travel to the U.S., and want to enter the U.S. visa-free under the Visa Waiver Program, must bear <b>machine-readable</b> passports that comply with international standards. If a foreign passport was issued on or after October 26, 2006, that passport must be a biometric passport.|$|E
25|$|A barcode is {{an optical}} <b>machine-readable</b> {{representation}} of data, which shows certain data on certain products. Originally, barcodes represented {{data in the}} widths (lines) and the spacings of parallel lines, and may {{be referred to as}} linear or one-dimensional barcodes or symbologies. They also come in patterns of squares, dots, hexagons and other geometric patterns within images termed two-dimensional matrix codes or symbologies. Norman Joseph Woodland is best known for inventing the barcode for which he received a patent in October 1952.|$|E
25|$|The repeating {{sequence}} of states of an LFSR {{allows it to}} be used as a clock divider or as a counter when a non-binary sequence is acceptable, as is often the case where computer index or framing locations need to be <b>machine-readable.</b> LFSR counters have simpler feedback logic than natural binary counters or Gray-code counters, and therefore can operate at higher clock rates. However, it is necessary to ensure that the LFSR never enters an all-zeros state, for example by presetting it at start-up to any other state in the sequence.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, the 500-won {{note was}} {{replaced}} by a coin. The following year, as part of its policy of rationalizing the currency system, the Bank of Korea issued a new set of notes, as well as a new set of coins. Some of the notes' most notable features were distinguishable marks for the blind under the watermark and the addition of <b>machine-readable</b> language in preparation for mechanization of cash handling. They were also printed on better-quality cotton pulp to reduce the production costs by extending their circulation life.|$|E
25|$|Optical {{character}} recognition (OCR) {{is preferable to}} rekeying for converting existing text that is already written down but not in <b>machine-readable</b> format (for example, a Linotype-composed book from the 1940s). In other words, to convert the text from an image to editable text (that is, a string of character codes), a person could re-type it, or a computer could look at the image and deduce what each character is. OCR technology has already reached an impressive state (for example, Google Book Search) and promises more for the future.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the elements above, another important feature of SBML is that every entity can have <b>machine-readable</b> annotations attached to it. These annotations {{can be used to}} express relationships between the entities in a given model and entities in external resources such as databases. A good example of the value of this is in BioModels Database, where every model is annotated and linked to relevant data resources such as publications, databases of compounds and pathways, controlled vocabularies, and more. With annotations, a model becomes more than simply a rendition of a mathematical construct—it becomes a semantically-enriched framework for communicating knowledge.|$|E
25|$|A barcode is an optical, <b>machine-readable,</b> {{representation}} of data; the data usually describes {{something about the}} object that carries the barcode. Originally barcodes systematically represented data by varying the widths and spacings of parallel lines, and may {{be referred to as}} linear or one-dimensional (1D). Later two-dimensional (2D) codes were developed, using rectangles, dots, hexagons and other geometric patterns in two dimensions, usually called barcodes although they do not use bars as such. Barcodes were initially scanned by special optical scanners called barcode readers. Later application software became available for devices that could read images, such as smartphones with cameras.|$|E
25|$|On August 24, 2017 the Canadian {{government}} {{announced that it}} would implement procedures for Canadians who wish to have their sex given as X (unspecified) on Canadian passports, {{which is one of the}} three permitted sex designations for <b>machine-readable</b> passports along with M (male) and F (female) specified by the International Civil Aviation Organization. As an interim measure until IRCC are able to print passports with X sex designations, effective August 31, 2017 IRCC offers passports with a note on the Observations page indicating that the passport holder should be identified as X rather than the printed sex designation on the data page.|$|E
25|$|The new {{biometric}} Philippine passport costs 950 pesos (approximately $21) in the Philippines or $60 abroad. Overtime processing for new passports costs {{an additional}} 250 pesos. Persons who {{take advantage of}} overtime processing get their passports within seven days for applications for Metro Manila (DFA Consular Affairs office, ASEANA, Parañaque, Alabang Town Center, SM Megamall, and Robinsons Galleria), Pampanga (Marquee Mall, Angeles and DFA Pampanga regional office), DFA Lucena regional office, and Robinsons Lipa, and 15 to 20 days in other provinces. For Filipinos abroad it will take up to 120 days. Passports previously could be amended for 100 pesos (approx. $2.50) in the Philippines or $20 abroad, although <b>machine-readable</b> passports are no longer amendable.|$|E
25|$|A {{programming}} {{language is a}} <b>machine-readable</b> artificial language. Programming languages {{can be used to}} create programs that specify the behavior of a machine, to express algorithms precisely, or as a mode of human communication. The first {{programming language}}s predate the modern computer. In mathematical logic and computer science, lambda calculus, also written as λ-calculus, is a formal system designed to investigate function definition, function application and recursion. It was invented by Alonzo Church and Stephen Cole Kleene in the 1930s as part of an investigation into the foundations of mathematics, but has now emerged as a useful tool in the investigation of problems in computability, recursion theory, and as a fundamental basis and a modern paradigm to computer programming and software languages.|$|E
25|$|The regular {{international}} passport has incorporated biometric features since 1998. The {{biometric passport}} contains an 8 kB microchip which {{was developed by}} a Malaysian technology firm, IRIS Corporation. In February 2010, the passport was updated {{to comply with the}} ICAO standard on biometric and <b>machine-readable</b> passports, while the pages in a 32-page passport was increased to 48 pages. Beginning April 2013, the passport underwent another round of updating by introducing a polycarbonate sheet that holds the passport bearer's information. The information is laser engraved into the polycarbonate sheet for added security, including a hologram mini-photo of the passport bearer. With this the passport now holds 50 pages instead of 48 pages. There is no more 64 pages option since 2011.|$|E
25|$|After the {{new regime}} came into force on 7 April 2017, {{significantly}} longer waiting times were reported at numerous external border crossing points, especially as it was just before the Easter holiday. Travellers entering Slovenia from Croatia (which, though a European Union member state, is not yet part of the Schengen Area) had to wait several hours as Slovenian border guards systematically checked the travel documents of all travellers (including those with the right of free movement) against relevant databases. The Prime Minister of Slovenia, Miro Cerar, acknowledged that the situation was 'unacceptable'. In order to alleviate the long queues, the systematic checking of travel documents of those with the right of free movement against relevant databases was temporarily suspended from the evening of Friday 7 April 2017 {{until the end of}} the weekend. However, the following weekend, long queues re-appeared. The Prime Minister of Croatia, Andrej Plenković, criticised the situation, calling it 'unsustainable', and expressed concern about the impact on tourism (which accounts for 18% of Croatia's GDP). The President of Croatia, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović, sent a formal letter to the European Commission to voice her concern about the effect of {{the new regime}} on border checks. At a meeting held on 29 April 2017, the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, Cerar and Plenković agreed that, moving forward, the systematic checking of the travel documents of those with the right of free movement against relevant databases would be suspended at land border crossing points between Croatia and Slovenia if the waiting time exceeds 15 minutes (with 'targeted checks' being carried out instead). Long queues were also reported at external border crossing points in Greece, where the leadership of the Hellenic Police (which is responsible for border checks) decided to suspend, for a period of 6 months, the systematic checking of travel documents of those with the right of free movement against relevant databases (with the exception of the Kipoi land border cossing point with Turkey, due to security concerns). Greece was particularly affected by the implementation of the new regime as Greek identity cards are not <b>machine-readable,</b> which meant that border guards had to enter the holder's information manually into the computer system to check the relevant databases if a Greek citizen presented an identity card instead of a passport. Similarly, long waiting times were reported at external border crossing points in France and Spain. Finland, Hungary and Italy also issued notifications suspending systematic checks at some external border crossing points. In July 2017, Greece submitted a request to suspend the systematic checking of travel documents of those with the right of free movement against relevant databases for a further period of 18 months, due to 'infrastructure shortcomings and increased traffic at 12 airports across the country'.|$|E
500|$|As of August 1, 2016, all new Lebanese {{passports}} issued will be biometric passports and <b>machine-readable</b> {{and will}} have a contactless smartcard RFID chip embedded inside the polycarbonate data page (3rd EU generation) or a cheap booklet in which the chip is imbeded {{at the bottom of}} the front cover under the word [...] "PASSEPORT".|$|E
500|$|On 12 April 2003, the Republic of Lebanon started issuing ICAO {{compliant}} <b>machine-readable</b> non-biometric passports {{with the}} navy blue cover, valid {{for one or}} five years, replacing the old burgundy red passport. It is the 45th {{nation in the world}} to adopt the ICAO standard. The implementation of the new passport began at offices across Beirut and Tripoli before expanding nationwide between April and June 2003 and to Lebanese embassies/consulates abroad between September and October 2003.|$|E
500|$|A 32-page {{passport}} with a burgundy red cover, {{commonly known}} as the old burgundy style came into use in 1990 {{under the auspices of the}} International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) with the formation of the Passport Service following international agreement on a standard format for passports, and remained in use until replaced by the modern-style <b>machine-readable</b> navy blue passport on April 12, 2003. As with many documents worldwide and all booklet-format documents, details were handwritten into the passport and (as of 1998) included: number, holder's name, [...] "accompanied by his wife" [...] and her maiden name, [...] "and" [...] (number) [...] "children", national status. For both bearer and wife: profession, place and date of birth, country of residence, height, eye and hair colour, special peculiarities, signature and photograph. Names, birth dates, and sexes of children, list of countries for which valid, issue place and date, expiry date, a page for renewals and, at the back, details of the amount of foreign exchange for travel expenses (a limited amount of sterling, typically 11,500 Lebanese Pounds but increasing with inflation, could be taken out of the country). The bearer's sex was not explicitly stated, although the name was written in with title ("Mr"). Descriptive text was printed in both Arabic, French, and English. (a practice which [...] continues), e.g. برفقة زوجته / Accompagné de sa femme (Née) / Accompanied by his wife (Maiden name)/. Changed details were struck out and rewritten, with a rubber-stamped note confirming the change.|$|E
