40|$|A {{significant}} emerging {{threat to}} coalition forces in littoral regions is from small craft such as jet skis, fast patrol boats, and speedboats. These craft, when armed, are categorized as Fast Inshore Attack Craft (FIAC), and their arsenal can contain {{an array of}} weapons to include suicide bombs, crew-served weapons, anti-tank or ship missiles, and torpedoes. While these craft often have crude weapon technologies, they use an asymmetric tactic {{of large numbers of}} small, cheap, poorly armed and armored units to overwhelm coalition defenses. Training on crew-served weapons on coalition ships has not advanced to meet this new threat. The <b>current</b> <b>training</b> methods do not satisfactorily train the following skills: Rules of engagement (ROE), marksmanship against highly maneuverable targets, threat prioritization, target designation, field of fire coordination, coordinated arms effects, or watch station to CIC communications. The creation of a prototype Augmented Reality Virtual At Sea Trainer (AR-VAST) shows that emerging augmented reality technologies can overcome limitations of traditional training methods. A fully developed AR-VAST system would be a deployable technology solution that uses in-place weapon systems as trainers in real-world environments with simulated enemy targets. While the AR-VAST architecture can be expanded to allow for training and coordination with multiple weapon operators, phone talkers, and bridge teams for <b>maximum</b> <b>training</b> effectiveness, the <b>current</b> prototype addresses the primary issue of identification and marksmanship.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} in the {{radiated}} emission spectrum of high-speed railway systems, a low-frequency range exists in which the magnetic field space-frequency distribution is determined, to a large extent, by the railway infrastructure features. To prove this, electromagnetic modeling of a suitably long stretch of the railway infrastructure is developed, and an ad hoc experimental campaign is carried out for comparison. Modeling and experimental measurements refer to a 50 km stretch of the Italian 2 × 25 kV ac railway system. Infrastructure simulation is obtained by resorting to a simplified approach based on multiconductor transmission line. To this end, short segments of uniform lines are cascade-connected with lumped networks representing equipment and electrical devices placed along the line, and the radiated magnetic field is evaluated from the corresponding noisecurrent distributions. Since the emission source, i. e., the train, has unknown electrical properties, it is represented as a unit-current source. Thus, the proposed model provides a transfer ratio between the radiated magnetic field and the current source. As a result, the <b>maximum</b> values of <b>train</b> <b>current</b> corresponding to magnetic field limits provided by the International Standards can be readily derived. An optimized measurement procedure is used to show that in the frequency band 60 – 120 kHz, transient emissions due to random and unpredictable phenomena are negligible. In such a frequency range, where continuous and persistent emissions are present, the structure of time–frequency measurement data is readily explained, {{and the role of}} the railway infrastructure on the radiated magnetic field is unambiguously identified...|$|R
