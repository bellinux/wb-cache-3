40|$|AbstractHepatitis-C (HCV) {{infection}} can induce kidney injury, mostly due to {{formation of}} immune-complexes and cryoglobulins, and possibly to a direct cytopathic effect. It may cause acute kidney injury (AKI) {{as a part}} of systemic vasculitis, and augments the risk of AKI due to other etiologies. It is responsible for <b>mesangiocapillary</b> or membranous <b>glomerulonephritis,</b> and accelerates the progression of chronic kidney disease due to other causes. HCV infection increases cardiovascular and liver-related mortality in patients on regular dialysis. HCV-infected patients are at increased risk of acute post-transplant complications. Long-term graft survival is compromised by recurrent or de novo glomerulonephritis, or chronic transplant glomerulopathy. Patient survival is challenged by increased incidence of diabetes, sepsis, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease, and liver failure. Effective and safe directly acting antiviral agents (DAAs) are currently available for treatment at different stages of kidney disease. However, the relative shortage of DAAs in countries where HCV is highly endemic imposes a need for treatment-prioritization, for which a scoring system is proposed in this review. It is concluded that the thoughtful use of DAAs, will result in a significant change in the epidemiology and clinical profiles of kidney disease, as well as improvement of dialysis and transplant outcomes, in endemic areas...|$|R
50|$|A kidney biopsy in {{patients}} with CFHR5 nephropathy classically shows deposition of complement C3 in the kidney, without any detectable immunoglobulins there.

In addition, light microscopy often demonstrates histological features of <b>mesangiocapillary</b> <b>glomerulonephritis.</b> CFHR5 Nephropathy is histologically distinguished from dense deposit disease by the absence of dense transformation of the glomerular basement membrane - electron microscopy rather reveals mesangial, subendothelial basement membrane, and occasional subepithelial basement membrane deposits which stain for complement C3.|$|E

It is usually good in children, because minimal change disease responds very well to steroids and does not cause chronic renal failure. Any relapses that occur become less frequent over time; the opposite occurs with <b>mesangiocapillary</b> <b>glomerulonephritis,</b> in which the kidney fails within three years of the disease developing, making dialysis necessary and subsequent kidney transplant.

50|$|This gene is {{a member}} of the {{regulators}} of complement activation (RCA) family and is located in the 'cluster RCA' region of chromosome 1. The gene encodes a monomeric single-pass type I membrane glycoprotein found on erythrocytes, leukocytes, glomerular podocytes, hyalocytes, and splenic follicular dendritic cells. The Knops blood group system is a system of antigens located on this protein. The protein mediates cellular binding to particles and immune complexes that have activated complement. Decreases in expression of this protein and/or mutations in its gene have been associated with gallbladder carcinomas, <b>mesangiocapillary</b> <b>glomerulonephritis,</b> systemic lupus erythematosus and sarcoidosis. Mutations in this gene have also been associated with a reduction in Plasmodium falciparum rosetting, conferring protection against severe malaria.

40|$|Abstract Introduction: Renal {{involvement}} is a severe form of schistosomiasis and occurs in 10 % to 15 % {{of patients with}} the hepatosplenic form of the disease.

When installed the renal injury by Schistosoma mansoni, classically presents as membranoproliferative <b>glomerulonephritis</b> (<b>mesangiocapillary)</b> with lobular accentuation. Objective: To report a case of schistosomiasis nephropathy that appeared 7 years after treatment of hepatosplenic schistosomiasis with histologic pattern of mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis with IgA deposits in mesangium. Clinically developed with progressive decrease of proteinuria with angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Method: It was reported a case of a 36 years old patient, brown, with classical sintoms of nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria > 3. 5 g/ 24 h, hypoalbuminemia and hypercholesterolemia), however with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis history 7 years ago and portal hypertension. Patient underwent renal biopsy which showed IgA deposits in mesangial, being more intense than immunoglobulin G (IgG), accompanied by C 1 q and C 3, with 4 / 13 glomeruli sclerotic, standard light mesangial glomerulonephritis renal injury with IgA deposits. Patient began taking ARB with progressive improvement in proteinuria. Conclusion: Patients with glomerulonephritis by schistosoma don't show improvement of disease progression with antiparasitic treatment.

40|$|Abstract. Morphologic {{examination}} of four Finnish Landrace mixed-breed lambs, 27 to 35 days of age, affected with <b>mesangiocapillary</b> <b>glomerulonephritis</b> type 1, demonstrated a progressive glomerulonephritis. By 27 days of age, three lambs had crescents in 58 to 93 % of glomeruli. These three lambs were also uremic. The accelerated rate of crescent formation {{was attributed to}} infiltrating polymorphonuclear leukocytes and mono-cytes, the result of discontinuities (gaps) in the glomerular basement membrane, and {{to the loss of}} the integrity of Bowman’s capsule. In the three lambs, platelets were identified adjacent to the endothelium or denuded glomerular basement membrane. Two distinctly different types of crescents were noted, apparently dependent on the integrity of Bowman’s capsule. One type resulted from the influx of inflammatory cells and dissociation of parietal epithelial cells from Bowman’s capsule. The other type was more extensive and contained collagen and was associated with damage to Bowman’s capsule resulting in cellular infiltration from the interstitium and sclerosis. Based on morphologic similarities, ovine <b>mesangiocapillary</b> <b>glomerulonephritis</b> is a suitable model for studying the pathogenesis and treatment of <b>mesangiocapillary</b> <b>glomerulonephritis</b> type 1 in human beings.

Histologically there was marked thickening of glomerular capillary basement membranes, proliferation of mesangial cells, and peri-glomerular fibrosis. An interstitial infiltration of plasma cells and lymphocytes was present with occasional tubular degeneration and proteinaceous cast formation. Focal leukoencephalomalacia was present in one lamb. Electron microscopy demonstrated deposition of electron-dense deposits in a subendothelial location with occasional fusion of overlying foot processes in glomerular capillaries.

At the time of diagnosis nine patients with hepatosplenomegaly (4 with associated arterial hypertension) and 12 (8 with arterial hypertension) among the patients with idiopathic MCGN had renal insufficiency. At the end of the follow-up period 16 patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis and MCGN (75. 2 months) and 15 with the idiopathic form (52. 1 months) had renal failure. Also, when compared at 48 months of follow-up, no difference in renal function could be detected in both groups.
