40|$|Recent linear gyrokinetic {{calculations}} {{carried out}} using spherical tokamak equilibria sug-gest that these devices {{are susceptible to}} instabilities producing magnetic reconnection at ion gyro-radius scale lengths. These so called <b>micro-tearing</b> modes {{have been identified in}} H-mode equilibria from MAST at Culham and NSTX at Princeton. In the past it was suggested these instabilities may provide an explanation for the anomalous heat transport in tokamak plasmas, but more recent work points towards the ion temperature gradient (ITG) driven instability as the main source of heat flux in conventional tokamaks. However, experimental data suggests that in NSTX H-mode plasmas [1], the heat transport occurs mainly through the electron channel, which is uncharacteristic of ITG transport. This transport may instead be due to electrons free streaming along stochastic magnetic fields, caused by the growth of <b>micro-tearing</b> instabilities.

5000|$|The UCL is {{important}} because it stabilizes the elbow from being abducted. If intense or repeated bouts of valgus stress occur on the UCL, injury will most likely transpire. Damage to the ulnar collateral ligament is common among baseball pitchers and javelin throwers because the throwing motion is similar. Physicians believe repetitive movements, especially pitching in baseball, cause adolescents' UCL injuries. Furthermore, physicians have stated that if an adolescent throws over 85 throws for 8 months or more in a year, or throw when exhausted, the adolescent has a significantly higher risk of succumbing to a UCL surgery. [...] Gridiron football, racquet sports, ice hockey and water polo players have also been treated for damage to the ulnar collateral ligament. Specific overhead movements like those that occur during baseball pitching, tennis serving or volleyball spiking increase the risk of UCL injury. During the cocking phase of pitching, the shoulder is horizontally abducted, externally rotated and the elbow is flexed. There is slight stress on the UCL in this position but it increases when the shoulder is further externally rotated. The greater the stress the more the UCL is stretched causing strain. During the overhead throwing motion, valgus stress on the medial elbow occurs during arm cocking and acceleration. The initiation of valgus stress occurs {{at the conclusion of the}} arm-cocking phase. In the transitional moment from arm cocking to arm acceleration, the shoulder vigorously rotates internally, the forearm is in near full supination, and the elbow flexes from 90° to approximately 125°. From late cocking to ball release, the elbow rapidly extends from approximately 125° to 25° at ball release. This causes tremendous valgus stress and tensile strain on the UCL. Injuries to the ulnar collateral ligament are believed to result from poor throwing mechanics, overuse, high throwing velocities, and throwing certain types of pitches, such as curveballs. Poor mechanics along with high repetition of these overhead movements can cause irritation, <b>micro-tears</b> or ruptures of the UCL. Injuries to the Ulnar Collateral Ligament in baseball players are rarely due to one-time, traumatic events. Rather, they are more often due to small chronic tears that accumulate over time.|$|E

As it turns out, tendinosis is far more often responsible for these symptoms than tendinitis (1, 2, 3). It is important for health care practitioners to distinguish between these disorders in order to apply the most appropriate treatment. Tendinitis is the inflammation of the tendon and results from <b>micro-tears</b> that happen when the musculotendinous unit is acutely overloaded with a tensile force that is too heavy and/or too sudden.

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground Tendinopathy is the term used to describe the patho-logical conditions resulting from tendon overuse [1, 2]. The morbidity of tendon injuries, especially in sports and in manual occupations, is relatively high in our society [3, 4]. Chronic tendon injuries are often associated with forceful or repetitive loading, which leads to the accumu-lation of <b>micro-tears</b> [2, 5]. The relationship between re-petitive mechanical loading and tenocyte metabolism has been previously investigated in several in vitro studies to investigate the influence of frequency, amplitude and time on the biochemical and biological response [6]. Recently, the biomechanical response of tenocytes was modeled under a variety of physiologically relevant frequency-modulated loading regimes [7 - 9]. Several studies demon-strate the regulation of MMP through the interaction of mechanical loading [6, 10, 11]. Thus, the mechano-biological response for linearly-oriented, viscoelastic tissues loaded with frequency modu-lation has been relatively well studied.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{analyzes}} the effect produced by sudden load {{changes on the}} fatigue of cold drawn prestressing steel wires {{to be used in}} prestressed concrete. Fatigue tests were performed on cylindrical samples under load control, using fatigue steps with different stress, and observing the appearance of a transient state in the fatigue crack propagation curve (da/dN-ΔK) when the product KmaxΔK suddenly decreases, a sort of overload retardation effect that allowed the calculation of the plastic zone size. In addition, the fatigue crack growth rate in the Paris regime, da/dN, obeys mainly to the parameter ΔK and it is hardly ever affected by Kmax. The study of the fatigue fracture surface shows: (i) that the micro-roughness of ductile <b>micro-tearing</b> patterns is a function of Kmax; (ii) the existence, in some tests, of a small zone with fatigue initiation fractography (with a tearing topography surface), related to the decrease of crack tip opening displacement, a phenomenon similar to that of crack initiation and growth from a micro-notch...|$|R
40|$|When {{exposed to}} {{resistance}} exercise, untrained muscle can develop <b>micro-tears</b> and disruptions in the sarcomeres.

The subjects were group matched and randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: placebo (CON), HMB pre exercise (PRE) or HMB pre-exercise and for 4 days following the exercise protocol (PRE-POST).

30|$|A {{separate}} {{study on}} the socio-economic demographics of these patients showed that {{the severity of the}} dyspareunia is inversely related to the age of sexual debut [18]. Women with late sexual debute may start with a less flexible tissue, hence increasing the likelihood that when sexual intercourse is attempted, macroscopic or microscopic tearing occur more easily, calling for repetitive healing processes and fibrosis to come in. Once present, increased stiffness is likely to cause more <b>micro-tears,</b> burning pain, and focal redness of the vestibule, starting a vicious cycle causing fear of pain and avoidance behavior. This hypothesis also supports the logic of direct widening surgery of the vestibule, without resection of tissue, to alleviate the primary cause and the vicious circle of difficult intromission, pain, and fibrosis. A similar pathway may be put into action when a woman has intercourse during or after perineal tearing or surgery or vulvovaginitis, increasing the likelihood of fibrotic repair processes to become involved. Also, very often, it is only after detailed questioning that such women with secondary dyspareunia will admit that they indeed experienced a slight introital sensitivity, of which they always thought it was considered to be “normal” and common in all women.|$|E

Wagner, PhD, Faculty Mentor Abstract C - reactive protein (CRP) is {{a protein}} {{produced by the}} liver in response to inflammation in the body. Strenuous exercise results in <b>micro-tears</b> to muscle tissue. These tears cause mild soreness and inflammation. The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine if CRP levels increase following vigorous aerobic exercise, and if they do in fact reach a maximum level following vigorous aerobic exercise. Sixteen subjects (5 male, 11 female), ages 32. 6 ± 10. 6 years were recruited to the study. The participants were asked to abstain from any vigorous activity for 12 hours period prior to their scheduled session. Participants rode a mechanically-braked cycle ergometer as hard as possible for 20 minutes. Blood was drawn from the antecubital vein at baseline (0 time), immediately post-exercise, and 24 hour post-exercise. CRP measures were made employing a bead-based assay (Millipore). A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine if there was a significant mean difference between the three time measures (baseline, immediate post-exercise, and 24 hour post-exercise) for CRP. The three measurements (baseline CRP = 0. 43 ± 0. 36, immediate post-exercise CRP = 0. 44 ± 0. 36, 24 hour post-exercise CRP = 0. 45 ± 0. 41) were not significantly different (F 2, 30 = 0. 209, p = 0. 672).

40|$|An {{interesting}} {{result of}} magnetic chaos reduction in RFX-mod high current discharges {{is the development}} of strong electron transport barriers. An internal heat and particle transport barrier is formed when a bifurcation process changes the magnetic configuration into a helical equilibrium and chaos reduction follows, together with the formation of a null in the q shear. Strong temperature gradients develop, corresponding to a decreased thermal and particle transport. Turbulence analysis shows that the large electron temperature gradients are limited by the onset of <b>micro-tearing</b> modes, in addition to residual magnetic chaos. A new type of electron transport barrier with strong temperature gradients develops more externally (r/a = 0. 8) accompanied by a 30 % improvement of the global confinement time. The mechanism responsible for the formation of such a barrier is still unknown but it is likely associated with a local reduction of magnetic chaos. These external barriers develop primarily in situations of well-conditioned walls so that they might be regarded as attempts towards an L-H transition. Both types of barriers occur in high-current low-collisionality regimes. Analogies with tokamak and stellarators are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract High-β spherical tokamak (ST) plasmas have {{intrinsic}} properties which favour {{the suppression}} of anomalous transport. Transport has been studied in NBI heated plasmas in the MAST ST device, where {{it is found that}} ion thermal transport is typically close to the neo-classical level. Calculations of the ITG micro-stability with the GS 2 gyro-kinetic code suggest that this form of turbulence may be suppressed by the high E×B shearing rates in these plasmas. Electron transport is somewhat higher and cannot be explained from mixing length estimates of ETG turbulence. This is perhaps due instead either to <b>micro-tearing</b> modes in the core plasma or extended radial structures in the saturated turbulence. Micro-stability is also favoured by low magnetic shear and this has been used to produce high-performance L- and H-mode plasmas with improved core confinement as well as plasmas exhibiting ITBs in both the ion and electron channels. Broad electron ITBs have been produced with counter-NBI heating in which anomalous electron transport apparently has been reduced by the very high E×B shearing rates prevailing in these plasmas. Such studies also contribute towards testing the transport and ITB physics basis for the ITER device. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{pedestal}} profile measurements in high triangularity JET plasmas {{show that}} with low fuelling the pedestal width decreases during the ELM cycle and with high fuelling it stays constant. In the low fuelling case the pedestal pressure gradient keeps increasing until the ELM crash {{and in the}} high fuelling case it initially increases then saturates during the ELM cycle. Stability analysis reveals that both JET plasmas become unstable to finite-n ideal MHD peeling-ballooning modes {{at the end of}} the ELM cycle. During the ELM cycle, infinite-n ideal MHD ballooning modes and kinetic ballooning modes are found to be locally stable in most of the steep pressure gradient region of the pedestal owing to the large bootstrap current, but to be locally unstable in a narrow region of plasma at the extreme edge. Unstable <b>micro-tearing</b> modes are found at the JET pedestal top, but they are sub-dominant to ion temperature gradient modes. They are insensitive to collisionality and stabilised by increasing density gradient. Comment: submitted to Nuclear Fusion, 23 pages, for EFDA-JET contributors see the Appendix of F.

RFX-mod is the largest reversed field pinch in the world, equipped with a system of 192 coils for active control of MHD stability. The discovery and understanding of helical states with electron internal transport barriers and core electron temperature > 1. 5 keV significantly advances the perspectives of the configuration. Optimized experiments with plasma current up to 1. 8 MA have been realized, confirming positive scaling. The first evidence of edge transport barriers is presented. Progress has been made also in the control of first-wall properties and of density profiles, with initial first-wall lithization experiments. Micro-turbulence mechanisms such as ion temperature gradient and <b>micro-tearing</b> {{are discussed in the}} framework of understanding gradient-driven transport in low magnetic chaos helical regimes. Both tearing mode and resistive wall mode active control have been optimized and experimental data have been used to benchmark numerical codes.

40|$|Dedicated β scan {{experiments}} have been recently performed in ASDEX Upgrade in H-mode plasmas with type-I ELMs. Two sets of discharges, in different density ranges, provided β vari-ations between βN = [1. 4 − 2. 2] and βN = [1. 4 − 2]. Global {{analysis of these}} β scan exhibits an unfavourable β scaling as Bτth ∝ β− 0. 9. This result is confirmed by the local transport analysis which shows an increase of the thermal heat diffusivity with increasing β as χe f f /B ∝ β 0. 65. These results are {{in agreement with the}} β exponents derived from the multi-machine scaling law (BτE ∝ β− 0. 9 [1]) and with experiments performed in JT- 60 U, which yield a β dependence as Bτth ∝ β− 0. 6 [2]. However, these results disagree with experiments carried out in DIII-D [3] and JET [4] where no β dependence was found for both energy confinement time and local diffusivity. In this paper we investigate and characterize the micro-instabilities present in the core of ASDEX Upgrade β scaling discharges by means of the gyrokinetic code GS 2.

40|$|New diagnostic, {{modelling}} {{and plant}} capability on the Mega Ampère Spherical Tokamak (MAST) have delivered important results in key areas for ITER/DEMO and the upcoming MAST Upgrade, a step towards future ST devices {{on the path}} to fusion currently under procurement. Micro-stability analysis of the pedestal highlights the potential roles of <b>micro-tearing</b> modes and kinetic ballooning modes for the pedestal formation. Mitigation of edge localized modes (ELM) using resonant magnetic perturbation has been demonstrated for toroidal mode numbers n = 3, 4, 6 with an ELM frequency increase by up to a factor of 9, compatible with pellet fuelling. The peak heat flux of mitigated and natural ELMs follows the same linear trend with ELM energy loss and the first ELM-resolved Ti measurements in the divertor region are shown. Measurements of flow shear and turbulence dynamics during L-H transitions show filaments erupting from the plasma edge whilst the full flow shear is still present. Off-axis neutral beam injection helps to strongly reduce the redistribution of fast-ions due to fishbone modes when compared to on-axis injection. Low-k ion-scale turbulence has been measured in L-mode and compared to global gyro-kinetic simulations. A statistical analysis of principal turbulence time scales shows them to be of comparable magnitude and reasonably correlated with turbulence decorrelation time. Te inside the island of a neoclassical tearing mode allow the analysis of the island evolution without assuming specific models for the heat flux. Other results include the discrepancy of the current profile evolution during the current ramp-up with solutions of the poloidal field diffusion equation, studies of the anomalous Doppler resonance compressional Alfvén eigenmodes, disruption mitigation studies and modelling of the new divertor design for MAST Upgrade.

40|$|The Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak (MAST) {{programme}} {{is strongly}} focused on addressing key physics issues {{in preparation for}} operation of ITER {{as well as providing}} solutions for DEMO design choices. In this regard, MAST has provided key results in understanding and optimizing H-mode confinement, operating with smaller edge localized modes (ELMs), predicting and handling plasma exhaust and tailoring auxiliary current drive. In all cases, the high-resolution diagnostic capability on MAST is complemented by sophisticated numerical modelling to facilitate a deeper understanding. Mitigation of ELMs with resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) with toroidal mode number nRMP = 2, 3, 4, 6 has been demonstrated: at high and low collisionality; for the first ELM following the transition to high confinement operation; during the current ramp-up; and with rotating nRMP = 3 RMPs. nRMP = 4, 6 fields cause less rotation braking whilst the power to access H-mode is less with nRMP = 4 than nRMP = 3, 6. Refuelling with gas or pellets gives plasmas with mitigated ELMs and reduced peak heat flux {{at the same time as}} achieving good confinement. A synergy exists between pellet fuelling and RMPs, since mitigated ELMs remove fewer particles. Inter-ELM instabilities observed with Doppler backscattering are consistent with gyrokinetic simulations of <b>micro-tearing</b> modes in the pedestal. Meanwhile, ELM precursors have been strikingly observed with beam emission spectroscopy (BES) measurements. A scan in beta at the L-H transition shows that pedestal height scales strongly with core pressure. Gyro-Bohm normalized turbulent ion heat flux (as estimated from the BES data) is observed to decrease with increasing tilt of the turbulent eddies. Fast ion redistribution by energetic particle modes depends on density, and access to a quiescent domain with 'classical' fast ion transport is found above a critical density. Highly efficient electron Bernstein wave current drive (1 A W- 1) has been achieved in solenoid-free start-up. A new proton detector has characterized escaping fusion products. Langmuir probes and a high-speed camera suggest filaments play a role in particle transport in the private flux region whilst coherence imaging has measured scrape-off layer (SOL) flows. BOUT++ simulations show that fluxes due to filaments are strongly dependent on resistivity and magnetic geometry of the SOL, with higher radial fluxes at higher resistivity. Finally, MAST Upgrade is due to begin operation in 2016 to support ITER preparation and importantly to operate with a Super-X divertor to test extended leg concepts for particle and power exhaust...|$|R
