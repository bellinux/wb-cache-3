25|$|Whereas European alchemy {{eventually}} {{centered on}} the transmutation of base metals into noble metals, Chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine. The philosopher's stone of European alchemists {{can be compared to}} the Grand Elixir of Immortality sought by Chinese alchemists. However, in the hermetic view, these two goals were not unconnected, and the philosopher's stone was often equated with the universal panacea; therefore, the two traditions may have had <b>more</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>than</b> initially appears.|$|E
25|$|One {{night after}} a party, Peggy decides {{to sleep with}} Charlie. He then flips out and reminds {{her that she had}} rebuffed him the weekend before and {{therefore}} believes she is playing games, then drives her home. Instead of going inside, she takes a walk and ends up at an all-night cafe. As she walks by, she sees Michael Fitzsimmons — the artsy loner in school she always wished she’d slept with - and goes in to talk to him. After finding out they have <b>more</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>than</b> originally thought, they ride off on his motorcycle. In a field, they smoke weed and find out more about one another. When he asks if she is going to marry Charlie, she responds that she already did that and will not do it again. After he recites some of his poetry for her, they have sex.|$|E

2500|$|Later on in {{the fall}} of 1984, the two fraternities were placed next to each other at a table during the NIC conference. [...] Discussions {{commenced}} and the members at the conference discovered that they had <b>more</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>than</b> the first two letters of their respective fraternity's names. Phi Sigma Epsilon's beliefs in justice, wisdom, and honor closely paralleled Phi Sigma Kappa's cardinal principles of brotherhood, scholarship, and character. [...] Phi Sigma Epsilon {{was in the midst of}} difficult administrative and financial circumstances and most chapters were in the interior of the contiguous United States. [...] Phi Sigma Kappa, although relatively strong both administratively and financially, was concentrated on the east and west coasts of the country. [...] It was found that both organizations had similar rituals upon the report of a brother of Phi Sigma Epsilon who had become an adviser of a Phi Sigma Kappa chapter. [...] That chapter had allowed the faculty adviser to view the rituals of Phi Sigma Kappa. [...] This was an error on the part of the Phi Sigma Kappa chapter but it allowed the two national organizations to otherwise resolve the awkward question of how similar their secrets were.|$|E
2500|$|Indian in the Sun (1981) {{was based}} on a short story by Israeli {{journalist}} and author Adam Baruch, with a script by Dita Guery (with Micha Levtov and Ram Loevy). In Playing Devils, Playing Angels, Loevy examined the relationship between affluent, urban Israelis and the [...] "Second Israel" [...] as a documentarian. In this film, he dramatized the conflicts and similarities between the two groups. The story revolves around Laufer (played by Doron Nesher), an Israeli soldier from the wealthy suburbs of northern Tel Aviv, who is ordered to accompany another soldier, known only as [...] "the Indian (played by Haim Gerafi)", to prison. [...] "The Indian" [...] was a dark-skinned Cochin Jew and a moshavnik (though Gerafi himself was an Ethiopian Jew), and the film highlights the patronizing attitude that Laufer has to his charge. Over time, however, and as the driver (played by Moshe Ivgy) watches, the two realize that they share a common enemy in the Establishment, and Laufer even offers to help the Indian escape. All the while, the driver watches in trepidation as two extremes of the Israeli social spectrum find that they have <b>more</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>than</b> they thought, and begin to forge an alliance between them. The film won the Harp of David Award for the best Israeli television production of the year, as well as the Israeli Broadcasting Authority Award.|$|E
