50|$|M. Georges Valensi (1889-1980) was a French {{telecommunications}} engineer who, in 1938, invented and patented {{a method}} of transmitting color images via luma and chrominance {{so that they could}} be received on both color and black & white television sets. Rival colour television methods, which had been in development since the 1920s, were incompatible with <b>monochrome</b> <b>televisions.</b>|$|R
50|$|Modern CRT {{displays}} {{are less}} susceptible than older CRTs {{prior to the}} 1960s {{because they have a}} layer of aluminum behind the phosphor which offers some protection.

25|$|Another {{solution}} would be to use a single screen, but break it up into a pattern of closely spaced colored phosphors instead of an even coating of white. Three receivers would be used, each sending its output to a separate electron gun, aimed at its colored phosphor. Although obvious, this solution was not practical. The electron guns used in <b>monochrome</b> <b>televisions</b> had limited resolution, and if one wanted to retain the resolution of existing monochrome displays, the guns would {{have to focus on}} individual dots three times smaller. This was beyond {{the state of the art}} at the time.|$|R
50|$|In North America, {{the basic}} signal {{standards}} since 1941 had been compatible enough in 2007 {{that even the}} oldest <b>monochrome</b> <b>televisions</b> could still receive color broadcasts. However, the United States Congress passed a law which required the cessation of all conventional television broadcast signals by February 2009. After that date all NTSC standard televisions with analog-only tuners went dark unless fitted with a digital ATSC tuner. The digital channels occupy the same spectrum as the analog channels. Some of the spectrum previously occupied by the highest numbered channels was auctioned off by the United States' Federal Communications Commission for other uses.|$|R
50|$|Just as {{with the}} other color {{standards}} adopted for broadcast usage over the world, SECAM is a standard which permits existing <b>monochrome</b> <b>television</b> receivers predating its introduction {{to continue to be}} operated as monochrome televisions. Because of this compatibility requirement, color standards added a second signal to the basic monochrome signal, which carries the color information. The color information is called chrominance or C for short, while the black-and-white information is called the luminance or Y for short. <b>Monochrome</b> <b>television</b> receivers only display the luminance, while color receivers process both signals.|$|E

50|$|All but one analog {{television}} system began as black-and-white systems. Each country, faced with local political, technical, and economic issues, adopted a color {{television system}} which was grafted onto an existing monochrome system, using {{gaps in the}} video spectrum (explained below) to allow color transmission information to fit in the existing channels allotted. The grafting of the color transmission standards onto existing monochrome systems permitted existing <b>monochrome</b> <b>television</b> receivers predating the changeover to color television {{to continue to be}} operated as <b>monochrome</b> <b>television.</b> Because of this compatibility requirement, color standards added a second signal to the basic monochrome signal, which carries the color information. The color information is called chrominance with the symbol C, while the black and white information is called the luminance with the symbol Y. <b>Monochrome</b> <b>television</b> receivers only display the luminance, while color receivers process both signals. Though in theory any monochrome system could be adopted to a color system, in practice some of the original monochrome systems proved impractical to adapt to color and were abandoned when the switch to color broadcasting was made.

50|$|Instead, the RGB {{signals are}} {{converted}} into YUV form, where the Y signal represents the lightness and darkness (luminance) {{of the colors}} in the image. Because the rendering of colors {{in this way is}} the goal of both black and white (monochrome) film and black and white (<b>monochrome)</b> <b>television</b> systems, the Y signal is ideal for transmission as the luminance signal. This ensures a monochrome receiver will display a correct picture in black and white, where a given color is reproduced by a shade of gray that correctly reflects how light or dark the original color is.|$|E

50|$|On February 26, 1951, WCBS-TV {{became the}} first station to {{broadcast}} a regularly scheduled feature film series, The Late Show. On August 11, 1951, WCBS-TV broadcast the first baseball game on color television, between the Brooklyn Dodgers and Boston Braves from Ebbets Field. As were all color programs at the time, it was transmitted via a field-sequential color system developed by CBS. Signals transmitted this way could not be seen on existing black-and-white sets. The CBS color system was scrapped after the FCC embraced the alternative RCA all-electronic dot sequential system, which was fully compatible with the existing <b>monochrome</b> <b>television</b> standard, late in 1953. However, CBS telecast few programs in color, either locally or on the network, until the mid-1960s when color receivers began to grow in popularity.|$|E
50|$|Drop frame {{timecode}} originates from {{a compromise}} invented when color NTSC video was invented. The NTSC designers wanted to retain compatibility with existing <b>monochrome</b> <b>televisions.</b> To minimise subcarrier visibility on a monochrome receiver {{it was necessary}} to make the color subcarrier an odd multiple of half the line scan frequency; the multiple originally chosen was 495. With a 30 Hz frame rate the line scan frequency is (30 × 525) = 15750 Hz. So the subcarrier frequency would have been (495/2 × 15750) = 3.898125 MHz. This was the subcarrier frequency originally chosen, but tests showed that on some monochrome receivers an interference pattern caused by the beat between the color subcarrier and the 4.5 MHz sound intercarrier could be seen. The visibility of this pattern could be greatly reduced by lowering the subcarrier frequency multiple to 455 (thus increasing the beat frequency from approx 600 kHz to approx 920 kHz) and by making the beat frequency also equal to an odd multiple of half the line scan frequency. This latter change could have been achieved by raising the sound intercarrier by 0.1% to 4.5045 MHz, but the designers, concerned that this might cause problems with some existing receivers, decided instead to reduce the color subcarrier frequency, and thus both the line scan frequency and the frame rate, by 0.1% instead. Thus the NTSC color subcarrier ended up as 3.57954545 MHz (exactly 315/88 MHz), the line scan frequency as 15734.27 Hz (exactly 9/572 MHz) and the frame rate 29.97 Hz (exactly 30/1.001 Hz).|$|R

40|$|During {{off-road}} navigation, drivers often {{must make}} size, distance, and clearance judgments of terrain features and obstacles {{in order to}} choose safe navigational routes.

This study evaluated how well subjects perceived size, distance, and clearance using <b>monochrome</b> and color <b>television</b> systems. Thirty-eight subjects (Ss) estimated the size, distance, and separation of two obstacles using video imagery produced by a forward-looking, vehicle-mounted camera. Results indicate that Ss typically overestimated distances, and when in error judging clearance, tended to overestimate the gap between the objects. These biases were expected due to the well documented minification effect of television using standard lenses. More surprising was the somewhat larger bias evidenced by Ss using color versus those using monochrome imagery.

40|$|Mandated by the FCC, {{television}} {{stations around the}} US have started {{to make the transition}} to digital television (DTV). Since not all households might have the capability of receiving DTV terrestrial broadcast signals professional video equipment manufacturers and broadcasters face two key challenges: being ready to support both digital and analog broadcasts, and being ready to support programming in both the DTV subgroups of HD (high-definition) and SD (standard definition). In other words, broadcasters must be prepared to support a multi-format video system.
