40|$|The {{literature}} review {{on the relationship}} between the textural properties and mechanical properties of rock aggregates indicates that most studies investigated the relationship in two separate processes, i. e. microscope observations and mechanical tests, and then correlate the mechanical properties with one of textural properties indirectly using various regression models. Samples of three granites with similar mineral content but varying mechanical properties are investigated by microscope texture quantification including image analysis followed by rock mechanics testing and rock aggregate testing in the laboratory. Computer simulation of rock mechanics properties, of strength of single aggregate particles and fracture of multiple particles in a cylindrical chamber (DSC test) is then made. Finally computer simulations are compared of with tumbling mill tests (LA test) through results from previous research. This study uses numerical modelling as a main tool to directly investigate the relationships, i. e. from the physical mechanisms' point of view and taking major textural properties into consideration. Two main modelling methods, i. e. <b>microstructural</b> <b>modelling</b> and micromechanical modelling are implemented. In the <b>microstructural</b> <b>modelling,</b> the numerical simulation model is built on the basis of rock microstructure. In the micromechanical modelling, the model is constructed {{on the basis of the}} Weibull theory. The modelled results from single particle tests of three granites, i. e. Ävja, LEP and Vändle under BTS, point-to-point, plane-to-plane, point-to-plane and multiple-point loading conditions using <b>microstructural</b> <b>modelling</b> and micromechanical modelling show that Ävja is weaker than LEP and Vändle in terms of the aggregate tensile strength and applied work. The <b>microstructural</b> <b>modelling</b> also reveals that LEP is weaker than Vändle but the micromechanical modelling indicates that LEP and Vändle have similar mechanical properties. From this work it is concluded that microscope texture quantification and computer simulation is a promising approach to analyse mechanical properties of rock aggregates. Numerical modelling of the DSC test shows the potential to simulate multi particle chamber compression tests for assessment of rock aggregate quality. In general, the texture properties work together to influence the mechanical properties of rock aggregates. Computer simulation using a heterogeneous material model provides a valuable tool to investigate the relationship between the textural properties and mechanical properties of rock aggregates by taking main textural properties into consideration. In particular, for the three rocks in this study, micro crack size distribution, grain perimeter and grain size show strong correlations with the mechanical properties, e. g. for DSC strength: cracks and grain size negatively affect the mechanical properties but the perimeter positively influences the mechanical properties.

40|$|ABSTRACT—The aim of {{the paper}} is to outline and discuss some ideas and {{preliminary}} results concerning <b>microstructural</b> <b>modelling</b> of brittle-like damage in solids. We argue that the basic premises of the simple microelastic theory (independent micro-dilatation of particles), developed by S.

In the brittle-like case under study, with the assumption of isotropic deterioration, the damage rate {{is added to the}} arguments (strain, damage and damage gradient) of the elastic energy density. The additional field quantity of the theory—the damage parameter in our context—leads to the appearance of hyperstresses and a balance equation for them. It is shown that the latter can be conveniently identified with the well-known Kachanov’s law of damage growth. Thus this law, traditionally introduced through purely phenomenological arguments, finds a natural place in the herein proposed damage model as an equation expressing hyperstress equilibrium. 1...|$|E

The ultimate goal of <b>microstructural</b> <b>modelling</b> is to predict the performance of cement-based materials throughout its service life. Benefiting from the rapid development in computer science, and the fundamental knowledge about the chemistry of cement hydration, several computer models have been developed in various groups to simulate the microstructure development of hydrating cement paste.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a framework that}} enables <b>microstructural</b> <b>modelling</b> of complex microstructures involving damage, localization and fracture. Classical computational homogenization schemes hinge on the separation of scales {{and the existence of}} representative volume elements. Due to the accumulation of micro-damage, the microstructural volume elements gradually loose their representative character and evolve towards a unique volume with a developing strain localization band, rendering classical homogenization approaches inapplicable. The assumption that the representative nature of the microstructure along the strain localization band is preserved enables the definition of advance scale transition relations for both imposing the overall macroscale load and coarse graining the cohesive behaviour of the strain localization band. Newly developed strain percolation path aligned boundary conditions have been used for this purpose. It is shown that this enables the development and progressive evolution of a strain localization band with minimal interference of the imposed boundary conditions. In addition to classical homogenization of the stress–strain response, a coarse graining scheme for the effective cohesive behaviour of the strain localization band is proposed. This enables the assessment of the microstructural evolution within the strain localization band and simultaneously provides the effective cohesive response useful for macroscale failure models...|$|E

The simulation of a short stack (F-design) of planar LSM-based anode-supported cells, developed and tested by Forschungszentrum Jülich, shows that a quantitative agreement with experimental data is obtained without fitting any parameter [2]. Simulations show that at 800 °C the activation resistance in the cathode functional layer is the main contribution to cell overpotential.

This paper focuses on the mathematical modelling of new hypothesis developed, densified volumetric growth (DVG), applied to the main hydration peak in alite hydration. This hypothesis assumes a time and particle size dependent growth rate and densification rate of C-S-H controlled by its internal surface area. To test this hypothesis a new <b>microstructural</b> <b>modelling</b> platform (CemRS), which incorporates the particle size distributions (PSD) of alite and fillers, has been developed. CemRS is an efficient program which simulates the hydration reaction and microstructural development, significantly reducing the computing costs and error due to truncation of PSD. The model was used to calibrate and predict the isothermal calorimetric results from the literature and two sets of original experimental results with alite replaced with different replacement fractions of quartz, fly ash and slag of different fineness. Combination of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and isothermal calorimetry agrees with the literature that supplementary cementing materials acts as a filler in the early age hydration. The model is able to capture and predict the effect of fineness and fillers without the need of varying the parameters for the particular set of simulations. Simulations shows that this model {{can be used as}} a tool to predict the effect of fineness and filler effect on the hydration kinetics of alite which could be later applied for hydration of OPC systems. The values of the parameters of simulation reflects the current experimental evidence from the literature and thus provide validation of the hypothesis. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Ice is {{a common}} mineral at the Earth’s surface. How much ice is stored in the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets depends on its {{mechanical}} properties. Therefore properties of ice directly impact on human society through its role in controlling sea level. The bulk behaviour of large ice masses {{is the result of}} the behaviour of the ensemble of individual ice grains. This is strongly influenced by the viscoplastic anisotropy of these grains and their lattice orientation. Numerical modelling provides a better insight into the mechanics of ice from the micro to the ice sheet scale. We present numerical simulations that predict the microstructural evolution of an aggregate of pure ice grains at different strain rates. We simulate co-axial deformation and dynamic recrystallization up to large strain using a full-field approach. The crystal plasticity code (Lebensohn et al., 2009) is used to calculate the response of a polycrystalline aggregate that deforms by purely dislocation glide, applying a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This code is coupled with the ELLE <b>microstructural</b> <b>modelling</b> platform to include intracrystalline recovery, as well as grain boundary migration driven by the reduction of surface and strain energies. The results show a strong effect of recrystallization on the final microstructure, producing larger and more equiaxed grains, with smooth boundaries. This effect does not significantly modify the single-maximum pattern of c-axes that are distributed at a low angle to the shortening direction. However, in experiments with significant recrystallization the a-axes rotate towards the elongation axis at the same time as the c-axes rotate towards the compression axis. If slip systems on prismatic and/or pyramidal planes are active, it is thought that a-axes gradually concentrate with depth (Miyamoto, 2005). The bulk activity of the slip systems is different depending on the relative activity of deformation versus recrystallization: the non-basal slip systems are more active at high strain in experiments with dynamic recrystallization compared to those experiments with low recrystallization activity...|$|E

40|$|The ice {{sheets in}} Greenland and Antarctica contain a {{significant}} amount of air within their upper approximately thousand meters and air hydrates below. While this air is still in exchange with the atmosphere in the permeable firn, the gas is entrapped at the firn-ice transition at 60 – 120 m depth. Understanding the dominant deformation mechanisms is essential to interpret paleo-atmosphere records and to allow a more realistic model of ice sheet dynamics. Recent research shows how the presence of air bubbles can significantly influence microdynamical processes such as grain growth and grain boundary migration (Azuma et al., 2012, Roessiger et al., 2014). Therefore, numerical modelling was performed focussing on the mechanical properties of ice with air inclusions and the implications of the presence of bubbles on recrystallisation. The full-field crystal plasticity code of Lebensohn (2001), using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), was coupled to the 2 D numerical <b>microstructural</b> <b>modelling</b> platform Elle, following the approach by Griera et al. (2013), and used to simulate dynamic recrystallization of pure ice (Montagnat et al., 2013). FFT calculates the viscoplastic response of polycrystalline and polyphase materials that deform by dislocation glide, takes into account the mechanical anisotropy of ice and calculates dislocation densities using the local gradient of the strain-rate field. Incorporating a code for polyphase grain boundary migration driven by surface and internal strain energy reduction, based on the methodology of Becker et al. (2008) and Roessiger et al. (2014), now also enables us to model deformation of ice with air bubbles. The presence of bubbles leads to an increase in strain localization, which reduces the bulk strength of the bubbly ice. In the absence of dynamic recrystallisation, air bubbles quickly collapse at low strains and spherical to elliptical bubble shapes are only maintained when recrystallisation is activated.

This project details an in-depth study of substructural dynamics during post-deformational annealing, using single-crystal halite as an analogue for silicate materials. The study combines three different techniques; in-situ annealing experiments conducted inside the scanning electron microscope and coupled with electron backscatter diffraction, 3 D X-ray diffraction coupled with in-situ heating conducted at the European Radiation Synchrotron Facility and numerical simulation using the <b>microstructural</b> <b>modelling</b> platform Elle. The main outcome of the project is a significantly refined model for recovery at annealing temperatures below that of deformation preceding annealing. Behaviour is highly dependent on the temperature of annealing, particularly related to the activation temperature of climb and is also strongly reliant on short versus long range dislocation effects. Subgrain boundaries were categorised {{with regard to their}} behaviour during annealing, orientation and morphology and it was found that different types of boundaries have different behaviour and must be treated as such. Numerical simulation of the recovery process supported these findings, with much of the subgrain boundary behaviour reproduced with small variation to the mobilities on different rotation axes and increase {{of the size of the}} calculation area to imitate long-range dislocation effects. Dislocations were found to remain independent to much higher misorientation angles than previously thought, with simulation results indicating that change in boundary response occurs at ~ 7 º for halite. Comparison of 2 D experiments to 3 D indicated that general boundary behaviour was similar within the volume and was not significantly influenced by effects from the free surface. Boundary migration, however, occurred more extensively in the 3 D experiment. This difference is interpreted to be related to boundary drag on thermal grooves on the 2 D experimental surface. While relative boundary mobilities will be similar, absolute values must therefore be treated with some care when using a 2 D analysis.

40|$|This thesis has {{identified}} the failure and damage processes in a particle filled epoxy which {{is typical of}} adhesives used industrially. Micromechanical analyses {{have been carried out}} to predict the material properties of damaged adhesive, and to investigate the applicability of different failure criteria. The general body of evidence suggests that there is no direct method of predicting the failure load of adhesive joints from the strength and toughness of the adhesive used. Therefore, a favoured approach has been to postulate a failure criterion, and to implement it in the constitutive equation for the adhesive. In contrast, this work has begun from the <b>microstructural</b> <b>modelling</b> of damage, and derived credible failure criteria from this model. The experimental program quantified the adhesive morphology and identified the damage processes that occur in the adhesive prior to failure. Bulk and joint specimens were tested both in-situ in a scanning electron microscope, and on a conventional tensile testing machine. The tests showed that the mechanisms for damage and failure in both joint and bulk form are particle debonding followed by cracking in the matrix. The concept of a representative unit cell of material was used {{to determine the effects of}} particle cracking and debonding. In a regular' array of cracked particles, the stiffness remained relatively unchanged in the plane of the cracks, but perpendicular to it, a significant reduction was found. Modelling debonded particles is more complex, because partial contact must be considered in addition to the fully bonded and fully debonded conditions. The unit cell was used to define the elasticity matrix for adhesive containing debonded particles as a function of strain state. The unit cell concept was extended further by including material that obeyed a modified (i. e. hydrostatically sensitive) Von Mises yield criterion. Particle debonding was found to contribute significantly to the hydrostatic sensitivity and to the softening of the adhesive. The unit cell concept was used to implement a strain at a distance failure criteria, using both elastic and plastic material properties. New types of failure criteria also based on the unit cell have been proposed. The criteria relate the strain state in an adhesive joint to the likelihood of shear banding or tensile plastic flow. The regions in a joint that experience one or the other of the mechanisms were identified. Hence the nature and extent of the adhesive failure in joints with varying joint geometry and loading may be predicted...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 75 - 78). This thesis {{reports on}} {{an investigation into}} the viability of developing idealised numerical models of cancellous bone in order to make reasonable predictions about its macro- and microstructural mechanical behaviour using the homogenisation method. In total joint replacement, cancellous bone (the soft porous bone which lies below the articular surfaces at weight-bearing joints) provides the medium for the transfer of loads from the artificial component, or prosthesis to the hard, outer cortical bone. Although total joint replacement is usually a successful operation - providing relief from pain and often considerably improved joint function - loosening of the metal components remains a major obstacle to the long-term success of these operations. In the ongoing work to develop joints which are less susceptible to loosening, it has become necessary to study the micromechanics of cancellous bone in order to predict its response to the changing stress environments brought about by the inserted prostheses. Biomechanical engineers have used finite element analysis extensively in the analysis of reconstructed joints. However, owing to the prohibitively high computational costs associated with the <b>microstructural</b> <b>modelling</b> of cancellous bone, it is generally modelled simply as a homogeneous, isotropic material. It is not possible to accurately predict the mechanical response of cancellous bone to various implant conditions under this simplistic modelling assumption. Thus, alternative methods are being sought which will allow for more realistic modelling of cancellous bone. The homogenisation method is one such alternative. This method makes it possible to uncouple the analysis of some problem involving a composite material into an apparent global analysis and a local microstructural analysis. The apparent material properties of the periodically repeating composite microstructure are calculated, taking into account the structural heterogeneities of the composite. These properties are then used in the global analysis where the composite is treated as a continuum. The apparent global-level results are subsequently postprocessed to obtain the microstructural behaviour in any local regions of interest. The main aim of this research project was to investigate the applicability of the homogenisation method to the modelling of cancellous bone. The first part of this work involved an extensive literature study on the architecture and micromechanics of cancellous bone to investigate whether cancellous bone can indeed be modelled as an idealised composite material with a periodically repeating microstructure. The outcome of this investigation revealed that the structure and behaviour of cancellous bone is highly variable - depending on the patient, anatomic location and the level of density. However, certain regions of cancellous bone do have typical repeating architectures which have a major influence on the apparent mechanical behaviour of the bone. Thus it has been concluded that these specific regions of cancellous bone can be modelled by idealised structures, provided the observed microstructures and predominant deformations modes are well characterised in the models...|$|E

As recent research showed, the presence of air bubbles can significantly influence microdynamical processes such as grain growth and grain boundary migration (Azuma et al., 2012, Roessiger et al., 2014). Understanding the dominant deformation mechanisms has essential implications on paleo-atmosphere research and allows more realistic modelling of ice sheet dynamics. Therefore, numerical models were set up and performed focussing on the implications of the presence of bubbles on recrystallisation and the mechanical properties of ice with air inclusions. The 2 D numerical <b>microstructural</b> <b>modelling</b> platform Elle was coupled to the full-field crystal plasticity code of Lebensohn (2001), which is using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) following the approach by Griera et al. (2013). Taking into account the mechanical anisotropy of ice, FFT calculates the viscoplastic response of polycrystalline and polyphase materials that deform by dislocation glide, predicts lattice re-orientation and using the local gradient of the strain-rate field, dislocation densities are calculated. FFT was used for the simulation of dynamic recrystallization of pure ice by Montagnat et al. (2013). Polyphase grain boundary migration driven by surface energy and internal strain energy reduction was incorporated in the code and now also enables us to model deformation of ice with air bubbles. The approach is based on the methodology of Becker et al. (2008) and Roessiger et al. (2014). During Deformation, spherical to elliptical bubble shapes are only maintained, when surface energy based recrystallisation is activated, whereas they quickly collapse at low strains in the absence of recrystallisation. The presence of bubbles leads to increased localization of stress, strain and dislocation densities, a reduction of the bulk strength of the bubbly ice is observed. Furthermore, strain-induced grain boundary migration already occuring in the uppermost levels of ice sheets (Kipfstuhl et al. 2009, Weikusat et al. 2009) is confirmed by our modelling.

40|$|International audienceMechanical {{properties}} of the skin, the external organ of the human body, are important for many applications such as surgery or cosmetics. Due to the highly hierarchical structure of the tissue, {{it is interesting to}} develop <b>microstructural</b> <b>models</b> which have a better predictability and should reduce the consequences of the sample variability. However, these models generally include a quite large number of mechanical parameters. Therefore, complex assays are required to achieve a proper identification of the <b>microstructural</b> <b>models.</b> We investigated here the best experimental protocol to identify a non-linear, anisotropic, model of skin behavior, namely the Holzapfel's law, using displacement field and force measurements. This was done through a sensitivity analysis of the different parameters. We determined first the 1 optimal assay, which appears to be a biaxial test with an alternated loading: first a stretch in one direction, then in the perpendicular one, and so on. To further improve the quality of the assay, we also determined the optimal geometry. Interestingly, slightly asymmetric geometries are more adequate than symmetric ones, while being easier to realize...|$|R
40|$|Flexible {{polyurethane}} foam {{is used in}} a variety of engineering applications, including automotive seating. It exhibits nonlinear and viscoelastic response to mechanical loading. Accurate models are needed for effective and efficient design of seating systems utilizing this material. The overall objective of the present investigation was to measure and model the mechanical behavior of open-cell, flexible polyurethane seating foam. Attention was restricted to planar deformation of the material. The mechanical response to uniaxial compression, as well as compression and shear, was measured using foam samples of two relative densities. Additionally, the material 2 ̆ 7 s Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio was investigated for the case of uniaxial compression. Modeling was approached from two points of view. First, the <b>microstructural</b> <b>modeling</b> approach consisted of representing the microscopic features of the material directly. Irregularity, that exists in a real foam, was modeled by using Voronoi tessellations. While, two-dimensional (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) <b>microstructural</b> <b>models</b> were constructed, parameter studied were restricted to the 2 D models for computational expediency. Uniaxial and combined compression and shear tests were simulated on numerous realizations of these models for a variety <b>microstructural</b> <b>model</b> parameters. The simulations were preformed by using the finite element method. The second approach is referred to here as the continuum modeling approach because the extent of the material was assumed to be much larger than the characteristic length of the microstructure. Nonlinear viscoelastic continuum-based models were developed for the mechanical response of the foam material. An additive decomposition of the stress response into a nonlinear elastic component and a linear viscoelastic component was assumed. The nonlinear elastic model component was based on a hyperelastic model commonly used in the study of rubber elasticity. The linear viscoelastic component was modeled with a hereditary-type integral that utilizes a sum of decaying exponential terms for the viscoelastic kernel. System identification techniques were developed to estimate the parameters of the continuum models from experimental data, as well as the response data from simulated tests on the <b>microstructural</b> finite element <b>models.</b> The relationship between the <b>microstructural</b> and continuum <b>model</b> parameters was also investigated. ...|$|R
