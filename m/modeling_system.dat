It has become the standard by which traditional Franklin Rod systems are installed. To understand this requires knowledge of how lightning 'moves'. As the step leader of a lightning bolt jumps toward the ground, it steps toward the grounded objects nearest its path. The maximum distance that each step may travel is called the critical distance and is proportional to the electric current. Objects are likely to be struck if they are nearer to the leader than this critical distance. It is standard practice to approximate the sphere's radius as 46m near the ground.|$|E

40|$|Maillard {{reaction}} is an imperative reaction that produces flavoring compounds in various food items. Additionally, some toxic compounds are also formed during this nonenzymatic reaction that mainly includes acrylamide and hydroxymethyl furfural. Current {{research was conducted}} to detect the concentration of acrylamide production during Maillard reaction in various <b>model</b> <b>systems</b> {{as well as in}} bakery items. Moreover, the reduction of acrylamide concentration by using various mitigation strategies was also included in the study plan. For the purpose, Maillard <b>model</b> <b>systems</b> were prepared by utilization of amino acids and reducing sugars. Two amino acids, glutamine and asparagine and two reducing sugars, glucose and fructose were taken and <b>model</b> <b>systems</b> were prepared by heating the samples in Reflux apparatus for 1 hr followed by Clevenger apparatus for 4 - 6 hrs in the presence of dichloromethane (solvent). About 1 ml sample was obtained by evaporation of separated solution in rotary evaporator. Then, acrylamide was examined by using the technique of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Subsequently, mitigation strategies like vacuum oven, calcium chloride and pectin were applied on these <b>model</b> <b>systems</b> and acrylamide was analyzed. Maximum acrylamide concentration was observed by GC-MS in control i. e., 22. 37 ï¿½ 1. 9 μg/g, while minimum (3. 51 ï¿½ 0. 5 μg/g) was recorded in pectin-treated <b>model</b> <b>system.</b> On the basis of <b>model</b> <b>systems,</b> minimum concentration (9. 63 ï¿½ 8. 1 μg/g) was examined in Fructose-Glutamine <b>model</b> <b>system.</b> The two; pectin-treated Fructose/Glutamine (F/Gm) and Glucose/Glutamine (G/Gm) <b>model</b> <b>systems</b> that contained very low amount of acrylamide were selected for further safety and product analysis. For the safety assessment, two selected <b>model</b> <b>systems</b> were added in water as 0. 5 and 1 % concentration and given to four groups of Sprague-Dawley rats. Control <b>model</b> <b>system,</b> F/Gm that contained less amount of acrylamide was given to the fifth group. Serum analysis, liver function tests, protein tests and renal function tests were performed. It was revealed that minimum values of AST and ALT were observed in group 2 (0. 5 % pectin-treated G/Gm <b>model</b> <b>system)</b> i. e., 85. 33 ï¿½ 3. 5 and 71. 00 ï¿½ 3. 0 IU/L, respectively due to less acrylamide formation. Minimum serum total protein was recorded as 4. 73 ï¿½ 0. 1 g/dL in group 3 (1 % pectintreated G/Gm <b>model</b> <b>system),</b> correspondingly. Minimum A/G ratio (0. 87 ï¿½ 0. 12) was recorded in group 1 (control) due to high acrylamide production. Urea explicated significant variation from group 1 (control) to group 5 (1 % pectin-treated F/Gm <b>model</b> <b>system)</b> i. e., 92. 67 ï¿½ 4. 0 to 40. 00 ï¿½ 7. 9 mg/dL, respectively. Afterwards, bakery products, bread, cookies and chapatti were prepared by using 0. 5 and 1 % concentration of F/Gm and G/Gm <b>model</b> <b>systems.</b> Acrylamide concentration was determined in bread by using GC-MS and it was found that minimum value of acrylamide (0. 07 ï¿½ 0. 08 μg/g) was recorded in T 4 (1 % pectin-treated F/Gm <b>model</b> <b>system).</b> Acrylamide content was decreased from 1. 93 ï¿½ 1. 9 to 0. 88 ï¿½ 1. 5 μg/g during the entire study. In cookies, minimum acrylamide concentration (0. 09 ï¿½ 0. 09 μg/g) was recorded in T 4 (1 % pectin-treated F/Gm <b>model</b> <b>system).</b> The acrylamide content was decreased from 1. 17 ï¿½ 1. 6 to 0. 52 ï¿½ 0. 6 μg/g during the entire study. In chapattis, high acrylamide concentration (2. 39 ï¿½ 0. 35 μg/g) was observed in T 0 (control). Conversely, minimum value of acrylamide concentration (0. 11 ï¿½ 0. 10 μg/g) was recorded in T 4 (1 % pectin-treated F/Gm <b>model</b> <b>system).</b> Acrylamide content was reduced from 1. 4 ï¿½ 0. 9 to 0. 80 ï¿½ 0. 8 μg/g during the entire storage period in chapattis.
