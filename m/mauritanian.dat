5|$|In 2007, {{there were}} 16 {{villages in the}} commune {{according}} to the <b>Mauritanian</b> government, with a total estimated population of 3,686.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the <b>Mauritanian</b> caste system, the {{development}} of traditional music in Mauritania has been supported by just a few families, threatened by a closed culture in which there are limited opportunities for support.|$|E
50|$|There {{is a large}} {{community}} of <b>Mauritanians</b> in Senegal, including {{tens of thousands of}} black <b>Mauritanians</b> expelled by their own government during a 1989 border incident.|$|R
50|$|Most of the <b>Mauritanians</b> are Soninké {{people from}} the Senegal River Valley, at the extreme south of Mauritania. There is also a {{significant}} number of <b>Mauritanians</b> who are born in France.|$|R
50|$|Around 5,000 <b>Mauritanians</b> are {{residing}} {{and working}} in the UAE.|$|R
5|$|The city is {{the hub of}} the <b>Mauritanian</b> {{economy and}} is home to a {{deepwater}} port and one of the country's two international airports. It hosts the University of Nouakchott and several other more specialized institutes of higher learning.|$|E
5|$|Nouakchott is {{the center}} of the <b>Mauritanian</b> economy, with three-quarters of service sector {{enterprises}} located in the city as of 1999 with 90% of the city's economic activity consisting of informal transactions. Some inhabitants have multiple addresses and maintain strong ties with their regions of origin, at times returning for labor.|$|E
5|$|Nouakchott {{is built}} around a large tree-lined street, Avenue Gamal Abdel Nasser, which runs {{northeast}} through the city centre from the airport. It divides the city into two, with the residential areas {{in the north and}} the medina quarter, along with the kebbe, a shanty town formed due to the displacement of people from other areas by the desert. Other major streets are named (in French) for notable <b>Mauritanian</b> or international figures of the 1960s: Avenue Abdel Nasser, Avenue Charles de Gaulle, Avenue Kennedy, and Avenue Lumumba, for example.|$|E

50|$|The wave of <b>Mauritanians</b> {{immigrants}} {{began in}} the 1960s. At that time, France requested immigrants from West Africa (Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Guinea). A lot of men workers came in France, followed by their wives and children. A few thousands of <b>Mauritanians</b> came in France {{to work in the}} automotive industry. But this wave of immigrants stopped in the 80s, because of the hardening of immigration policy in France.|$|R
50|$|Although {{nearly all}} <b>Mauritanians</b> are Muslim, {{the degree of}} religiosity varies in the population. There are liberal Muslims, {{moderate}} Islamists, Wahabbist, and jihadist Muslims in the country.|$|R
5|$|Some <b>Mauritanian</b> {{dolphins}} {{cooperate with}} human fishermen. The dolphins drive {{a school of}} fish towards the shore, where humans await with nets. In the confusion of casting nets, the dolphins catch {{a large number of}} fish as well. Intraspecies cooperative foraging has also been observed. These behaviors may also be transmitted via teaching. Controversially, Rendell and Whitehead have proposed a structure for the study of cetacean culture. Similar cases have been observed in Laguna, Santa Catarina in Brazil since during 19th century as well.|$|E
5|$|The Gateway Protection Programme {{initially}} had a {{quota of}} 500 refugees per year, which was later increased to 750, {{but the actual}} number of refugees resettled in most years has been fewer than the quota permitted. Liberian, Congolese, Sudanese, Burmese, Ethiopian, <b>Mauritanian,</b> Iraqi, Bhutanese, Eritrean, Palestinian and Somali refugees are amongst those who have been resettled under the programme. Refugees have been resettled to a number of locations in England and Scotland. Of the 18 local authorities participating as resettlement locations by 2012, eight are in the North West region of England and three in Yorkshire and Humberside. Evaluations of the programme have praised it as having a positive impact on the reception of refugees by local communities, but have also noted the difficulties these refugees have faced in securing employment.|$|E
5|$|Alongside her singing, Malouma {{has also}} fought to {{safeguard}} her country's music, urging {{the government to}} create a music school, forming her own foundation in support of musical heritage, and in 2014 creating her own music festival. She has also been active in politics since the 1990s, {{when she began to}} campaign for more democracy. She was elected a senator in 2007, the first politician in her caste, but was arrested the following year after a coup d'état. When elections were again held in 2009, she became a senator for the opposition Ech-Choura party where she was given special responsibilities for the environment. This led in 2011 to her appointment as the IUCN's Goodwill Ambassador for Central and West Africa. In December 2014, she announced she was moving from the opposition to join the ruling party, the Union for the Republic, where she felt she could be more effective in contributing to the country's progress. Her work has been recognized by the French, who decorated her as a Knight of the Legion of Honor, and the Americans, whose ambassador to Mauritania named her a <b>Mauritanian</b> Woman of Courage.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mauritanians</b> in France {{consist of}} {{migrants}} from Mauritania {{and their descendants}} {{living and working in}} France. They are one of the diasporas from Black Africa in France.|$|R
50|$|Linguistically, the {{majority}} of North Africans in United States speak English, Arabic, Coptic, French (Moroccans, Algerians, Tunisians and <b>Mauritanians),</b> Berber, Italian (Libyans) and Spanish (some Isleños and Sahrawis).|$|R
50|$|The Friday Mosque of Chinguetti {{is widely}} {{considered}} by <b>Mauritanians</b> to be the national symbol of the country. The recently discovered offshore oilfield was named Chinguetti in its honor.|$|R
5|$|As {{families}} have {{no means of}} preserving their music, or recording it, their creations are often forgotten owing {{to the absence of}} family members interested in ensuring their survival. The situation has been compounded by rules forbidding their support from outside the family environment. Concerned that the musical traditions of the country were vanishing, in 2006, Malouma urged the government to create a school to preserve the country's music heritage, even introducing a measure to Parliament. In 2011, she created the Malouma Foundation in support of the preservation of the national musical heritage. The foundation aims to protect and preserve the Arab, African, and Berber roots of music in Mauritania and, to that end, is collecting and storing music from throughout the country to both preserve it and make it available for other uses, including education. Long concerned that the Moorish music traditions of her country were being replaced by the Malian and Moroccan music preferred by younger people, in 2014, she created a <b>Mauritanian</b> Music Festival.|$|E
5|$|Malouma {{commenced}} {{her education}} at {{elementary school in}} 1965 in Mederdra. She qualified as {{an elementary school teacher}} in 1974 in Rosso. According to the traditions of her country, those of the Meidah family are required to carry on the art of their ancestors. As a result, she had to give up her aspirations to teach. Members of each caste are allowed only to marry other members of society within the same caste and the entire society is divided by castes politically, economically, and culturally. Movement outside of a particular caste is forbidden. She learned to play the traditional stringed instruments only women play, especially the ardin harp, and was taught traditional <b>Mauritanian</b> music by her father, who enjoyed an eclectic mix of music. As a result, she grew up listening to classical western works such as Beethoven, Chopin, Mozart, Vivaldi and Wagner, as well as the music of traditional Berber, Egyptian, Lebanese and Senegalese artists. She often accompanied her parents who sang traditional griots.|$|E

50|$|About 20% of <b>Mauritanians</b> live on {{less than}} US$1.25 per day. Mauritania suffers from several human rights issues, {{including}} slavery, as at least 4% of the population (155,600 people) are enslaved against their will.|$|R
25|$|Mauritania has the University of Nouakchott {{and other}} {{institutions}} of higher education, {{but the majority of}} highly educated <b>Mauritanians</b> have studied outside the country. Public expenditure on education was at 10.1% of 2000–2007 government expenditure.|$|R
25|$|In 2014, Jemal Oumar, a <b>Mauritanian</b> journalist, {{was arrested}} for apostasy, after he posted a {{critique}} of Mohammad online. While local law enforcement agencies held him in prison for trial, local media announced offers by local Muslims of cash reward to anyone who would kill Jemal Oumar. In a separate case, Mohamed Mkhaitir, a <b>Mauritanian</b> engineer, {{was arrested for}} apostasy in 2014 as well, for publishing an essay on racism in <b>Mauritanian</b> society with criticism of Islamic history and a claim that Mohammad's discriminated in his treatment of people from different tribes and races.|$|E
25|$|On 6 March 2009, the Israeli {{diplomatic}} {{delegation to}} Mauritania left {{after nine years}} of diplomatic ties, following a demand from the <b>Mauritanian</b> authorities to close the Israeli embassy in Nouakchott within 48 hours. The <b>Mauritanian</b> delegation to Israel left earlier without sending official notice to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs.|$|E
25|$|In October 1987, the {{government}} allegedly uncovered a tentative coup d'état {{by a group}} of black army officers, backed, according to the authorities, by Senegal. Fifty-one officers were arrested and subjected to interrogation and torture. Heightened ethnic tensions were the catalyst for the Mauritania–Senegal Border War, which started {{as a result of a}} conflict in Diawara between Moorish <b>Mauritanian</b> herders and Senegalese farmers over grazing rights. On 9 April 1989, <b>Mauritanian</b> guards killed two Senegalese.|$|E

They were among 3,000 to 5,000 blacks — predominantly soldiers and civil servants — arrested between October 1990 and mid-January 1991. Some <b>Mauritanian</b> exiles believe that the number was as high as 5,000 {{on the basis of}} alleged involvement in an attempt to overthrow the government.|$|E
