50|$|Three {{partners}} {{created the}} J.W. Anderson Company in Dundas, Ontario in 1952 to serve domestic demand for water softening equipment. In 1965, Anderson expanded into the industrial water treatment <b>market.</b> <b>Installations</b> through the 1960s and 70's {{were used by}} various industries such as food & beverage, pulp & paper, chemical, power generation and pharmaceutical. From this experience in 1974 Anderson became the first Canadian distributor for DuPont membranes. In the early 1980s Anderson pioneered the split-flow counter-current ion exchange process while expanding into the United States market. Five officers of the J.W. Anderson Company bought it out in 1985, forming Anderson Water Systems Limited which saw continued growth driven by projects in oil and petrochemical.|$|R

40|$|The {{politics}} of local versus global food infiltrates our homes and kitchens daily. Much {{of the population}} is completely unaware of the distance that their food must travel. Many of the choices that we make about food are automatic. We are trained at very young age to eat three meals a day. But the duration and purpose of our meals has changed drastically in the last century. Our fast paced culture forces us to gobble down frozen, canned and pre-packaged food without thought of quality or taste. So one might ask, why should we care about where our food comes from and when and where we eat it? My <b>market</b> <b>installation,</b> digital prints, artist books, video of my urban gardening and sculpture (in the form of jars of fruit and vegetables that I have preserved) seeks to provoke awareness of the urgency of such questions in contemporary life...|$|R

50|$|The {{emerging}} CPV segment has comprised ~0.1% of {{the fast-growing}} utility <b>market</b> for PV <b>installations</b> {{over the past}} decade. Unfortunately, {{by the end of}} 2015, the near term outlook for CPV industry growth has faded with closure of all of the largest CPV manufacturing facilities: including those of Suncore, Soitec, Amonix, and Solfocus. Nevertheless, the growth outlook for the overall PV industry continues to appear strong.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSolar {{photovoltaic}} (PV) {{system provides}} significant {{social and environmental}} benefits {{in comparison to the}} conventional energy sources, thus contributing to sustainable development. The worldwide PV <b>market</b> <b>installations</b> reached a very high growth in 2011 (27. 4 GW). These are encouraging news since electricity generation from PV produces no greenhouse gas emissions and as such provides a clean alternative to fossil fuels, contributes to job creation and economic prosperity even in less developed areas. However, manufacturing PV modules can have consequences for workers and on the environment throughout their life cycle (from raw material extraction and procurement, to manufacturing, disposal, and/or recycling). Large scale PV deployment also needs land that may not be available, or in competition with other land uses. These potential problems seem to be strong barriers for a further dissemination of PV technologies. Conventional PV (silicon based) manufacturing processes have roots in the electronics industry, many of the chemicals found in e-waste are also found in solar PV, including lead, brominated flame retardants, cadmium, and chromium. The manufacturing of solar cells involves several toxic, flammable and explosive chemicals. Many of those components suppose a health hazard to workers involved in manufacturing of solar cells. Solar panels are often in competition with agriculture and can cause soil erosion. The disposal of electronic products is becoming an escalating environmental and health problem in many countries. Recycling of PV panel is currently not economically viable because waste volumes generated are too small; significant volumes of end-of-life photovoltaic panels will begin to appear in 2025 or 2030. An overview of social and environmental impacts of PV technologies is presented in this paper along with potential benefits and pitfalls...|$|R

25|$|Within the {{cumulative}} PV {{capacity in the}} U.S., there has been growth in the distributed generation segment, which are all grid-connected PV installations in the residential and non-residential markets. Non-residential <b>market</b> includes <b>installations</b> on commercial, government, school and non-profit organization properties. Between 2000 and 2013 there had been 2,261 MW of residential solar and 4,051 MW non-residential solar installed. In 2013, there were 1,913 MW installed for these markets; the top 5 states were California, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Hawaii, and Arizona. The residential market had 60% annual growth in 2013. The growth contributing factors were new marketing strategies to partner with retailers to reach more customers, and new financial models including the securitization of residential solar assets. Non-residential PV had a slight growth of 4% in 2013 as the market was recovering from the oversupply in 2012. The future growth will likely come from New York, Arizona, and Colorado.|$|R
40|$|Grid-connected {{photovoltaic}} installations grew by 60 % in 2006. California and New Jersey {{have the}} largest <b>markets</b> and <b>installations</b> {{more than doubled in}} New Jersey, Nevada, Colorado, Connecticut, and many other states with smaller markets. The off-grid growth has been steady, but significantly lower. For {{the first time in more}} than a decade, a solar thermal electric plant was installed in 2006. More than 350 MW installed in the 1990 's still generates electricity today. Solar water heating and solar space heating installations grew in 2006 after years offlat installation numbers. Hawaii dominates this market, with nearly half of the market. Solar pool heating accounts for the largest number of installations and has grown at an average rate of 10 % since 1998. However, installations decreased by 7 % in 2006. Installations in California and Florida together are 73 % of the pool heating market...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} 5 years {{the growth rate}} in wind energy has been as high as 30 % an on average nearly 25 % in all continents, and a {{considerable}} number of countries have very ambitious goals concerning their wind energy development, therefore it could be likely to cover as much as 20 % of the world’s electricity consumption by wind in 2030 and 35 % in 2050, although on the shorter term growth is expected to take place mainly in Europe, USA and China. The market is maturing, therefore achieving more stable economies in the wind energy sector. As a result, better electrical grids suited for wind power are being developed and better planning tools as well as other frameworks, which benefit the <b>market</b> for <b>installation</b> of wind turbines, are being implemented across all wind energy countries. The cost of wind-generated electricity has fallen steadily for the last two decades, driven largely by technological advances, increased production levels and the use of larger turbines.

40|$|In recent years, project {{owners and}} {{designers}} have been clamoring for reliable {{information on the}} material and performance characteristics of erosion control materials. Users of these products consider test data as vital information to predict application success {{for a variety of}} projects, to evaluate potential materials and installation methods, and to establish project-specific quality requirements. Likewise, quality-conscience manufacturers of erosion control products need this documentation for product research and development; sales and <b>marketing</b> purposes; <b>installation</b> guidelines; and product certification purposes. Many users and manufacturers have done informal field tests on erosion control products with varying levels of documentation and reliability. Contract testing services are available through a few universities provided fee requirements and scheduling conflicts can be negotiated. This paper details the design and construction of a dedicated, state-of-the-art erosion test laboratory located in Rice Lake, Wisconsin. This outdoor facility is being developed to provide quantitative performance data on erosion control products and materials, under conditions representing both hillslope and channel environments, in a timely and cost-effective manner...|$|R
