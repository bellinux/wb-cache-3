2500|$|Two-stage {{variable}} twin-turbos {{employ a}} small turbocharger at low speeds {{and a large}} one at higher speeds. They are connected in a series so that boost pressure from one turbocharger is multiplied by another, hence the name [...] "2-stage." [...] The distribution of exhaust gas is continuously variable, so the transition from using the small turbocharger to the large one can be done incrementally. Twin turbochargers are primarily used in Diesel engines. For example, in Opel bi-turbo Diesel, only the smaller turbocharger works at low speed, providing high torque at 1,500–1,700rpm. Both turbochargers operate together in <b>mid</b> <b>range,</b> with the larger one pre-compressing the air, which the smaller one further compresses. A bypass valve regulates the exhaust flow to each turbocharger. At higher speed (2,500 to 3,000 RPM) only the larger turbocharger runs.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. Minimal Important Differences (MIDs) {{establish}} benchmarks {{for interpreting}} mean differences {{in clinical trials}} involving quality of life outcomes and inform discussions of clinically meaningful change in patient status. As such, {{the purpose of this}} study was to assess MIDs for the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–Melanoma (FACT-M). ^ Methods. A prospective validation study of the FACT-M was performed with 273 patients with stage I to IV melanoma. FACT-M, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS) scores were obtained at baseline and 3 months following enrollment. Anchor- and distribution-based methods were used to assess MIDs, and the correspondence between <b>MID</b> <b>ranges</b> derived from each method was evaluated. ^ Results. This study indicates that an approximate <b>range</b> for <b>MIDs</b> of the FACT-M subscales is between 5 to 8 points for the Trial Outcome Index, 4 to 5 points for the Melanoma Combined Subscale, 2 to 4 points for the Melanoma Subscale, and 1 to 2 points for the Melanoma Surgery Subscale. Each method produced similar but not identical <b>ranges</b> of <b>MIDs.</b> ^ Conclusions. The properties of the anchor instrument employed to derive MIDs directly affect resulting <b>MID</b> <b>ranges</b> and point values. When MIDs are offered as supportive evidence of a clinically meaningful change, the anchor instrument used to derive thresholds should be clearly stated along with evidence supporting the choice of anchor instrument as the most appropriate for the domain of interest. In this analysis, the KPS was a more appropriate measure than the ECOG-PS for assessing MIDs. ...|$|R
40|$|Turboprop engines {{generate}} vibrations in the <b>mid</b> frequency <b>range</b> {{which are}} transmitted as structure-born sound to an aircraft fuselage. There it is radiated {{into the cabin}} as noise. To manage the acoustic impact validated simulation models and analysis methods are necessary. The A 400 M Acoustic Fuselage Demon- strator, a full scale aircraft fuselage, was used to develop test methods providing the validation data needed. The <b>mid</b> frequency <b>range</b> provides great challenges for such tests: To expand the well-established method of experimental modal analysis (EMA) into higher frequencies {{a very large number}} of measurement points is necessary. To ensure high quality results testing procedures from ground vibration tests (GVT) were adapted to the <b>mid</b> frequency <b>range.</b> The resulting sensor grid is a mixture of an optimized sensor distribution for low frequency analysis and a high density grid in the propeller plane of the A 400 M. To measure the approx- imately 2800 sensor positions a roving sensor method was used. Using several sensors permanently fixed to the structure the overall consistency of the data was analyzed. The methods presented here were able to provide high quality data used in later works for both model updating and method validatio...|$|R
