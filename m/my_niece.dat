500|$|Anderson stated {{she was in}} Berlin {{to inform}} Princess Irene of Prussia (sister of Tsarina Alexandra and cousin of Tsar Nicholas II) of her survival. Olga commented, [...] " [...] {{was one of the}} most straightlaced women in her generation. <b>My</b> <b>niece</b> would have known that her {{condition}} would have indeed have shocked [...]" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes! yes!" [...] resumed Sir Patrick, impatiently. [...] "Blanche's {{distress}} is intelligible enough. But here is <b>my</b> <b>niece</b> apparently answerable {{for this}} unhappy woman's disappearance. Can {{you explain what}} <b>my</b> <b>niece</b> has {{got to do with}} it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had my own}} {{motive for}} asking you to luncheon today," [...] she began, in that steady downright way of {{speaking}} that was peculiar to her. [...] "I {{wanted to have a}} word with you privately. <b>My</b> <b>niece</b> Regina--don't be surprised at my calling her <b>my</b> <b>niece,</b> when you have heard Mr. Farnaby call her his daughter. She is <b>my</b> <b>niece.</b> Adopting her is a mere phrase. It doesn't alter facts; it doesn't make her Mr. Farnaby's child or mine, does it?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{dedication}} reads: [...] "To <b>my</b> <b>nieces,</b> Shirley and Beverly, {{and their}} flying fingers".|$|R
60|$|Mar. Nay, if she be a fruit-woman, <b>my</b> <b>nieces</b> {{shall not}} enter her doors.|$|R
5000|$|Gervais {{has said}} that the {{programme}} was inspired by his relatives who work in care homes: [...] "Half my family are care workers. My sister works with kids with learning difficulties. My sister-in-law works in a care home for people with Alzheimer's. And four or five of <b>my</b> <b>nieces</b> work in old people's homes. I always write about what my inlaws and four fifths of <b>my</b> <b>nieces</b> know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I refer again," [...] Phineas Duge said, [...] "to the {{question}} of <b>my</b> <b>niece.</b> As regards those other matters, {{if you do not}} wish to discuss them with me, let them go. Even in this country you will find that I am not powerless. But as regards <b>my</b> <b>niece,</b> I insist upon some explanation from you." ...|$|E
60|$|MISS SUSAN. This--this is <b>my</b> <b>niece,</b> Livvy--Miss Willoughby, Miss Henrietta, Miss Fanny Willoughby.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Parbleu! class not <b>my</b> <b>niece</b> {{with those}} sordid beings, man,' said the Chevalier, angrily. 'Here is your price'--tossing a heavy purse on the table--'and as much more shall await {{you when you}} bring me sure {{intelligence}} where to find <b>my</b> <b>niece.</b> You understand; and mark, not one word of the gentleman you saw here. You say she believes him dead?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was never}} {{intended}} to be a permanent thing, anyhow," [...] continued Mr. Merrick; [...] "yet I must express my admiration for the courage and talent <b>my</b> <b>nieces</b> have displayed in forcing a temporary success where failure was the logical conclusion. Shortly, however, they intend to retire gracefully from the field of journalism, leaving me with a model country newspaper plant on my hands. Therefore it is I, Thursday and Hetty, and not <b>my</b> <b>nieces,</b> who have a proposition to place before you.|$|R
6000|$|MRS. CRASHAW: [...] "Yes, it's very nice, though I say it that shouldn't of <b>my</b> <b>niece's</b> elevator. The worst {{about it}} is, it's so slow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And how is it," [...] {{he asked}} severely, [...] "that {{you were not}} here yesterday? <b>My</b> <b>niece's</b> letter led me to expect that you would arrive yesterday." ...|$|R
60|$|Pand. Now, {{my sweet}} prince! {{have you seen}} <b>my</b> <b>niece?</b> no, I know you have not.|$|E
6000|$|Pand. Because she's <b>my</b> <b>niece,</b> {{therefore}} she's not so fair as Helen; an' {{she were}} not <b>my</b> <b>niece,</b> show me such {{another piece of}} woman's flesh: take her limb by limb: I say no more, but if Paris had seen her first, Menelaus had been no cuckold: but what care I {{if she were a}} blackamoor? what am I the better for her face? ...|$|E
60|$|PHOEBE (still dancing). Not Miss Phoebe, Patty. I am not myself to-night, I am--let me see, I am <b>my</b> <b>niece.</b>|$|E
6000|$|But the {{stewardess}} would return in a moment. [...] "You'd better {{tell me what}} to call you," [...] he said quietly. [...] "I ought to know <b>my</b> <b>niece's</b> first name." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} so!" [...] she replied severely. [...] "Will {{you be so}} good as to tell me at once {{what you mean by}} refusing <b>my</b> <b>niece's</b> {{invitation}} to dine?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I called in, {{on my way}} upstairs, {{more than}} half expecting to find you here,' said Ralph, {{addressing}} his niece, and looking contemptuously at the portrait. 'Is that <b>my</b> <b>niece's</b> portrait, ma'am?' ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. MALAPROP O mercy! and miracles! what a turn here is--why, sure, captain, you haven't behaved disrespectfully to <b>my</b> <b>niece.</b>|$|E
6000|$|COLONEL. [Losing {{all traces}} of his fussiness, and drawing himself up {{as though he were}} on parade.] You tell me that <b>my</b> <b>niece?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Down--for one moment--for but one moment,' said Mr Haredale, helping Daisy to the ground, and {{following}} himself. 'Willet--Willet--where are <b>my</b> <b>niece</b> and servants--Willet!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ten {{thousand}} pardons, my dear madam!" [...] {{cried the}} captain. [...] "I see in <b>my</b> <b>niece's</b> face, I feel in <b>my</b> <b>niece's</b> pulse, {{that one of}} her violent neuralgic attacks has come on again. My dear girl, why hesitate among friends to confess that you are in pain? What mistimed politeness! Her face shows she is suffering--doesn't it Mrs. Lecount? Darting pains, Mr. Vanstone, darting pains {{on the left side of}} the head. Pull down your veil, my dear, and lean on me. Our friends will excuse you; our excellent friends will excuse you for the rest of the day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'They mean well; their {{feelings}} are strong, but their hearts {{are in the}} right place. I flatter myself you will like <b>my</b> <b>nieces,</b> the Parc√¶. They are accomplished, and favourites among the men.' ...|$|R
6000|$|He put his hat {{under his}} arm, and {{feeling in his}} breast for Emily's letter, took it out, {{unfolded}} it, {{and gave it to}} her. 'Please to read that, ma'am. That's <b>my</b> <b>niece's</b> hand!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I dare him to speak--the beggar! the knave! the specious hypocrite! the vile, insinuating, infamous menial!--Stand {{apart from}} <b>my</b> <b>niece,</b> sir. Let her go!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{were dancing}} with <b>my</b> <b>niece</b> just now--show us your skill now, and dance {{with one of}} my daughters. Stand up, Miss Henrietta Gorgon--Mr. What's-your-name?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have asked}} her to come and live at Blakely with <b>my</b> <b>niece</b> and myself. She is an {{excellent}} typist, and I require a secretary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go {{and find}} James, {{and ask him}} to step here," [...] {{commanded}} the mistress, [...] "and then guard the opening in the hedge, and see that none of <b>my</b> <b>nieces</b> appear to bother him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Goldstein, you are intruding, as Mr. Weldon says. But {{you have}} said so much to defame <b>my</b> <b>nieces</b> {{in the eyes of}} our friends, here assembled, that you must explain {{yourself}} more fully." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It won't be long, Phibbs. But I {{must try}} to live until <b>my</b> <b>nieces</b> come, and I can decide which of them is most worthy {{to care for the}} old place when I am gone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Misery," [...] {{she said}} to the old housekeeper, [...] "show <b>my</b> <b>niece,</b> Miss Patricia, to the rose chamber. And see that she is made comfortable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{appealed to}} Mr. Brinkworth (knowing of his {{attachment}} to <b>my</b> <b>niece),</b> in her name, {{and for her}} sake, to leave you to shift for yourself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True, that's what puzzles me; the child's Christian name is Emma--the {{same as that}} of <b>my</b> <b>niece</b> and sister--but {{she says}} her last name is Wilson." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The fact is <b>my</b> <b>nieces</b> are {{in grief}} and trouble, {{and this is}} no time or place for love-making. I am sorry to be uncivil, but I must ask you not to come here any more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, sir, I think I {{have the}} right to ask, as <b>my</b> <b>niece's</b> present guardian, and almost indeed as her father, whether or not your visit is {{connected}} in any way with matrimonial overtures toward that lady?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know now, Mr. Le Frank, why you {{declined}} to be <b>my</b> <b>niece's</b> music-master. Allow me to apologise for having ignorantly placed you in a false position. I appreciate the delicacy of your conduct--I understand, and admire you." ...|$|R
