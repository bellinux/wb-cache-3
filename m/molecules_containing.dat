5|$|Neon is {{the first}} p-block noble gas, and the first element with a true octet of electrons. It is inert: {{as is the case}} with its lighter analogue, helium, no {{strongly}} bound neutral <b>molecules</b> <b>containing</b> neon have been identified. The ions +, +, and + have been observed from optical and mass spectrometric studies. Solid neon clathrate hydrate was produced from water ice and neon gas at pressures 0.35–0.48 GPa and temperatures ca. –30°C. Ne atoms are not bonded to water and can freely move through this material. They can be extracted by placing the clathrate into a vacuum chamber for several days, yielding ice XVI, the least dense crystalline form of water.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{is a long}} polymer {{made from}} repeating units called nucleotides. The {{structure}} of DNA is dynamic along its length, being capable of coiling into tight loops, and other shapes. In all species it is composed of two helical chains, bound to each other by hydrogen bonds. Both chains are coiled round the same axis, and have the same pitch of 34ångströms (3.4nanometres). The pair of chains has a radius of 10ångströms (1.0nanometre). According to another study, when measured in a different solution, the DNA chain measured 22 to 26ångströms wide (2.2 to 2.6nanometres), and one nucleotide unit measured 3.3Å (0.33nm) long. Although each individual nucleotide repeating unit is very small, DNA polymers can be very large <b>molecules</b> <b>containing</b> millions to {{hundreds of millions of}} nucleotides. For instance, the DNA in the largest human chromosome, chromosome number 1, consists of approximately 220 million base pairs and would be 85mm long if straightened.|$|E

5|$|Paleoclimatologists {{measure the}} ratio of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 in the shells and skeletons of marine organisms to {{determine}} the climate {{millions of years ago}} (see oxygen isotope ratio cycle). Seawater molecules that contain the lighter isotope, oxygen-16, evaporate at a slightly faster rate than water <b>molecules</b> <b>containing</b> the 12% heavier oxygen-18, and this disparity increases at lower temperatures. During periods of lower global temperatures, snow and rain from that evaporated water tends to be higher in oxygen-16, and the seawater left behind tends to be higher in oxygen-18. Marine organisms then incorporate more oxygen-18 into their skeletons and shells than they would in a warmer climate. Paleoclimatologists also directly measure this ratio in the water molecules of ice core samples as old as hundreds of thousands of years.|$|E

25|$|Many {{thousands}} of <b>molecules</b> <b>containing</b> the sulfanilamide structure {{have been created}} since its discovery (by one account, over 5,400 permutations by 1945), yielding improved formulations with greater effectiveness and less toxicity.

25|$|Intramolecular aldol {{reaction}} is the condensation reaction of two aldehyde groups or ketone {{groups in the}} same molecule. Five- or six-membered , -unsaturated ketone or aldehyde is formed as the product. This {{reaction is}} an important approach {{to the formation of}} carbon-carbon bond in organic <b>molecules</b> <b>containing</b> ring systems. For example, under strong basic conditions (e.g. sodium hydroxide), hexane-2,5-dione (compound A in Figure 1) can cyclize via intramolecular aldol reaction to form the 3-methylcyclopent-2-en-1-one (compound B).|$|E
25|$|Pyrrole {{itself is}} not {{naturally}} occurring, but many of its derivatives are found {{in a variety of}} cofactors and natural products. Common naturally produced <b>molecules</b> <b>containing</b> pyrroles include vitamin B12, bile pigments like bilirubin and biliverdin, and the porphyrins of heme, chlorophyll, chlorins, bacteriochlorins, and porphyrinogens. Other pyrrole-containing secondary metabolites include PQQ, makaluvamine M, ryanodine, rhazinilam, lamellarin, prodigiosin, myrmicarin, and sceptrin.

25|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons are <b>molecules</b> <b>containing</b> {{two or more}} simple aromatic rings fused together by sharing two neighboring carbon atoms (see also simple aromatic rings). Examples are naphthalene, anthracene, and phenanthrene. In fused aromatics, not all carbon–carbon bonds are necessarily equivalent, as the electrons are not delocalized over the entire molecule. The aromaticity of these molecules can be explained using their orbital picture. Like benzene and other monocyclic aromatic molecules, polycyclics have a cyclic conjugated pi system with p-orbital overlap {{above and below the}} plane of the ring.|$|E
25|$|The {{centrifugal}} {{separation of isotopes}} was first suggested by Aston and Lindemann in 1919 and the first successful experiments were reported by Beams and Haynes on isotopes of chlorine in 1936. However attempts to use the technology during the Manhattan project were unproductive. In modern times it is the main method used throughout the world to enrich uranium {{and as a result}} remains a fairly secretive process, hindering a more widespread uptake of the technology. In general a feed of UF6 gas is connected to a cylinder that is rotated at high speed. Near {{the outer edge of the}} cylinder heavier gas <b>molecules</b> <b>containing</b> U-238 collect, while <b>molecules</b> <b>containing</b> U-235 concentrate at the center and are then fed to another cascade stage. Use of gaseous centrifugal technology to enrich isotopes is desirable as power consumption is greatly reduced when compared to more conventional techniques such as diffusion plants since fewer cascade steps are required to reach similar degrees of separation. In fact, gas centrifuges using uranium hexafluoride have largely replaced gaseous diffusion technology for uranium enrichment. As well as requiring less energy to achieve the same separation, far smaller scale plants are possible, making them an economic possibility for a small nation attempting to produce a nuclear weapon. Pakistan is believed to have used this method in developing its nuclear weapons.|$|E
25|$|Often {{done with}} gases, {{but also with}} liquids, the {{diffusion}} method relies {{on the fact that}} in thermal equilibrium, two isotopes with the same energy will have different average velocities. The lighter atoms (or the <b>molecules</b> <b>containing</b> them) will travel more quickly and be more likely to diffuse through a membrane. The difference in speeds is proportional to the square root of the mass ratio, so the amount of separation is small and many cascaded stages are needed to obtain high purity. This method is expensive due to the work needed to push gas through a membrane and the many stages necessary.|$|E
3000|$|In general, {{the rate}} {{constant}} {{for the light}} <b>molecule</b> (the <b>molecule</b> <b>containing</b> the light isotope), which has higher vibrational zero-point energy, is greater than that for the heavy <b>molecule</b> (the <b>molecule</b> <b>containing</b> the heavy isotope) (Bigeleisen 1949).

25|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} is {{a technology}} {{used to produce}} enriched uranium by forcing gaseous uranium hexafluoride (hex) through semi-permeable membranes. This produces a slight separation between the <b>molecules</b> <b>containing</b> 235U and 238U. Throughout the Cold War, gaseous diffusion {{played a major role}} as a uranium enrichment technique, and as of 2008 accounted for about 33% of enriched uranium production, but in 2011 was deemed an obsolete technology that is steadily being replaced by the later generations of technology as the diffusion plants reach their ends-of-life. In 2013, the Paducah facility in the US ceased operating, it was the last commercial 235U gaseous diffusion plant in the world.|$|E
25|$|The gas {{centrifuge}} process uses {{a large number}} of rotating cylinders in series and parallel formations. Each cylinder's rotation creates a strong centripetal force so that the heavier gas <b>molecules</b> <b>containing</b> 238U move tangentially toward the outside of the cylinder and the lighter gas molecules rich in 235U collect closer to the center. It requires much less energy to achieve the same separation than the older gaseous diffusion process, which it has largely replaced and so is the current method of choice and is termed second generation. It has a separation factor per stage of 1.3 relative to gaseous diffusion of 1.005, which translates to about one-fiftieth of the energy requirements. Gas centrifuge techniques produce about 54% of the world's enriched uranium.|$|E
25|$|Argon ionises at 15.76eV, {{which is}} higher than hydrogen, but lower than helium, neon or fluorine. <b>Molecules</b> <b>containing</b> argon can be van der Waals {{molecules}} held together very weakly by London dispersion forces. Ionic molecules can be bound by charge induced dipole interactions. With gold atoms there can be some covalent interaction. Experimental methods used to study argon compounds have included inert gas matrices, infrared spectroscopy to study stretching and bending movements, microwave spectroscopy and far infrared to study rotation, and also visible and ultraviolet spectroscopy to study different electronic configurations including excimers. Mass spectroscopy is used to study ions. Computation methods {{have been used to}} theoretically compute molecule parameters, and predict new stable molecules. Computational ab initio methods used have included CCSD(T), MP2 (Møller–Plesset perturbation theory of the second order), CIS and CISD. For heavy atoms, effective core potentials are used to model the inner electrons, so that their contributions {{do not have to be}} individually computed. More powerful computers since the 1990s have made this kind of in silico study much more popular, being much less risky and simpler than an actual experiment. This article is mostly based on experimental or observational results.|$|E

25|$|At Illinois Arduengo {{examined}} {{more broadly}} {{the areas of}} organo-main group element chemistry, and <b>molecules</b> <b>containing</b> unusual valency. His first publications involving the chemistry of electron-deficient carbenes occurred during this period. This work with electron deficient carbenes led to the first structure determinations on a nitrile ylide and a carbonyl ylide. His later work with carbene chemistry would become his most recognized contribution {{to the field of}} chemistry (vide infra). During the Illinois years Arduengo had a close collaboration with his colleague J.C. Martin who was a physical-organic chemist also working on organo-main group element chemistry and hypervalency. Many of the technical discussions between Martin and Arduengo would take place over lunch (the choice of restaurants often influenced by the quality of the napkins for writing chemical structures). To facilitate discussions about unusual molecular structures and bonding for main-group element centers, Martin and Arduengo devised the N-X-L nomenclature system. The synthesis and characterization of the first compound with a planar T-shaped, 10-electron 3-coordinate bonding arrangement at a phosphorus atom, ADPO, was also accomplished by the Arduengo group at Illinois and paved the way for a range of novel main-group element chemistry (including the discovery of edge inversion) on his return to DuPont. The final Illinois research extended the newly discovered ADPO chemistry to the arsenic analog (ADAsO).|$|E

Dalton, by contrast, did not consider this possibility. [...] Curiously, Avogadro considers only <b>molecules</b> <b>containing</b> even numbers of atoms; he does not say why odd numbers are left out.|$|E
50|$|A mass {{spectrum}} of an organic compound will usually contain a small peak of one mass unit {{greater than the}} apparent molecular ion peak (M) of the whole molecule. This {{is known as the}} M+1 peak and comes from the handful of <b>molecules</b> that <b>contain</b> a 13C atom in place of a 12C. A <b>molecule</b> <b>containing</b> one carbon atom will be expected to have an M+1 peak of approximately 1.1% {{of the size of the}} M peak, as 1.1% of the molecules will have a 13C rather than a 12C. Similarly, a <b>molecule</b> <b>containing</b> two carbon atoms will be expected to have an M+1 peak of approximately 2.2% of the size of the M peak, as there is double the previous likelihood that any <b>molecule</b> will <b>contain</b> a 13C atom.|$|R
