5|$|The {{more massive}} the star, the shorter its lifespan, {{primarily}} because <b>massive</b> <b>stars</b> have greater pressure on their cores, {{causing them to}} burn hydrogen more rapidly. The most <b>massive</b> <b>stars</b> last an average of a few million years, while stars of minimum mass (red dwarfs) burn their fuel very slowly and can last tens to {{hundreds of billions of}} years.|$|E

5|$|Most 16O is {{synthesized}} {{at the end}} of the helium fusion {{process in}} <b>massive</b> <b>stars</b> but some is made in the neon burning process. 17O is primarily made by the burning of hydrogen into helium during the CNO cycle, making it a common isotope in the hydrogen burning zones of stars. Most 18O is produced when 14N (made abundant from CNO burning) captures a 4He nucleus, making 18O common in the helium-rich zones of evolved, <b>massive</b> <b>stars.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rotation {{rates of}} <b>massive</b> <b>stars</b> have a {{critical}} {{influence on their}} evolution and eventual death. The rotation rate of the Eta Carinae stars cannot be measured directly because their surfaces cannot be seen. Single <b>massive</b> <b>stars</b> spin down quickly due to braking from their strong winds, but there are hints that both Eta Carinae A and B are fast rotators, up to 90% of critical velocity. One or both could have been spun up by binary interaction, for example accretion onto the secondary and orbital dragging on the primary.|$|E
5|$|Starburst {{galaxies are}} {{characterized}} by dusty concentrations of gas {{and the appearance of}} newly formed stars, including <b>massive</b> <b>stars</b> that ionize the surrounding clouds to create H II regions. These <b>massive</b> <b>stars</b> produce supernova explosions, resulting in expanding remnants that interact powerfully with the surrounding gas. These outbursts trigger a chain reaction of star building that spreads throughout the gaseous region. Only when the available gas is nearly consumed or dispersed does the starburst activity end.|$|E

5|$|The {{progenitors}} of Type Ib/c supernovae are {{not observed}} at all, and constraints on their possible luminosity are often {{lower than those}} of known WC stars. WO stars are extremely rare and visually relatively faint, so it is difficult to say whether such progenitors are missing or just yet to be observed. Very luminous progenitors have not been securely identified, despite numerous supernovae being observed near enough that such progenitors would have been clearly imaged. Population modelling shows that the observed Type Ib/c supernovae could be reproduced by a mixture of single <b>massive</b> <b>stars</b> and stripped-envelope stars from interacting binary systems. The continued lack of unambiguous detection of progenitors for normal Type Ib and Ic supernovae may be due to most <b>massive</b> <b>stars</b> collapsing directly to a black hole without a supernova outburst. Most of these supernovae are then produced from lower-mass low-luminosity helium stars in binary systems. A small number would be from rapidly-rotating <b>massive</b> <b>stars,</b> likely corresponding to the highly-energetic Type Ic-BL events that are associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts.|$|E

40|$|Sometimes {{the early}} star {{formation}} {{can be found}} in cold and dense molecular clouds, such as infrared dark cloud (IRDC). Considering star formation often occurs in clustered condition, HII regions may be triggering a new generation of star formation, so we can search for initial stage of <b>massive</b> <b>star</b> formation around HII regions. Based on that above, this work is to introduce one method of how to search for initial stage of <b>massive</b> <b>star</b> formation around HII regions. Towards one sample of the HII region G 18. 2 - 0. 3, multiwavelength observations are carried out to investigate its physical condition. In contrast and analysis, we find three potential initial stages of <b>massive</b> <b>star</b> formation, suggesting that it is feasible to search for initial stage of <b>massive</b> <b>star</b> formation around HII regions.

5|$|A {{hierarchical}} structure of matter began to form from minute {{variations in the}} mass density of space. Matter accumulated in the densest regions, forming clouds of gas and the earliest stars, the Population III stars. These <b>massive</b> <b>stars</b> triggered the reionization process and {{are believed to have}} created many of the heavy elements in the early Universe, which, through nuclear decay, create lighter elements, allowing the cycle of nucleosynthesis to continue longer.|$|E
5|$|As {{the more}} <b>massive</b> <b>stars</b> appear, they {{transform}} the cloud into an H II region (ionized atomic hydrogen) of glowing gas and plasma. The stellar wind and supernova explosions from these stars eventually cause the cloud to disperse, often leaving behind {{one or more}} young open clusters of stars. These clusters gradually disperse, and the stars join {{the population of the}} Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|Core-collapse {{is thought}} to occur when the more <b>massive</b> <b>stars</b> in a {{globular}} cluster encounter their less massive companions. Over time, dynamic processes cause individual stars to migrate {{from the center of}} the cluster to the outside. This results in a net loss of kinetic energy from the core region, leading the remaining stars grouped in the core region to occupy a more compact volume. When this gravothermal instability occurs, the central region of the cluster becomes densely crowded with stars and the surface brightness of the cluster forms a power-law cusp. (Note that a core collapse is not the only mechanism that can cause such a luminosity distribution; a massive black hole at the core can also result in a luminosity cusp.) Over a lengthy period of time this leads to a concentration of <b>massive</b> <b>stars</b> near the core, a phenomenon called mass segregation.|$|E

5|$|During their helium-burning phase, {{a star of}} {{more than}} 9 solar masses expands to form first a blue and then a red supergiant.

5|$|In <b>massive</b> <b>stars,</b> heavier {{elements}} {{can also}} be burned in a contracting core through the neon-burning process and oxygen-burning process. The final stage in the stellar nucleosynthesis process is the silicon-burning process that results {{in the production of}} the stable isotope iron-56, an endothermic process that consumes energy, and so further energy can only be produced through gravitational collapse.|$|E
5|$|The closest analogs {{within the}} Milky Way galaxy {{of the stars}} {{producing}} long gamma-ray bursts are likely the Wolfâ€“Rayet stars, extremely hot and <b>massive</b> <b>stars,</b> which have shed {{most or all of}} their hydrogen to radiation pressure.

In {{order to}} {{distinguish}} between the various components of <b>massive</b> <b>star</b> forming regions (i. e. infalling, outflowing and rotating gas structures) within our own Galaxy, we require high angular resolution observations which are sensitive to structures on all size scales.

5|$|The {{formation}} of a star begins with gravitational instability within a molecular cloud, caused by regions of higher density â€“ often triggered by compression of clouds by radiation from <b>massive</b> <b>stars,</b> expanding bubbles in the interstellar medium, the collision of different molecular clouds, or the collision of galaxies (as in a starburst galaxy). When a region reaches a sufficient density of matter to satisfy the criteria for Jeans instability, it begins to collapse under its own gravitational force.|$|E
5|$|Very <b>massive</b> <b>stars</b> can undergo core {{collapse}} when {{nuclear fusion}} becomes unable {{to sustain the}} core against its own gravity; passing this threshold {{is the cause of}} all types of supernova except Type Ia. The collapse may cause violent expulsion of the outer layers of the star resulting in a supernova, or the release of gravitational potential energy may be insufficient and the star may collapse into a black hole or neutron star with little radiated energy.|$|E
5|$|Binary stars form a {{significant}} portion of the total population of stellar systems, with up to half of all stars occurring in binary systems. Numerical simulations of globular clusters have demonstrated that binaries can hinder and even reverse the process of core collapse in globular clusters. When a star in a cluster has a gravitational encounter with a binary system, a possible result is that the binary becomes more tightly bound and kinetic energy is added to the solitary star. When the <b>massive</b> <b>stars</b> in the cluster are sped up by this process, it reduces the contraction at the core and limits core collapse.|$|E
40|$|In {{this note}} {{we suggest that}} high-mass black holes; i. e., black holes of several solar masses, can be formed in {{binaries}} with low-mass main-sequence companions, provided that the hydrogen envelope of the <b>massive</b> <b>star</b> is removed in common envelope evolution which begins only after the <b>massive</b> <b>star</b> has finished He core burning. That is, the <b>massive</b> <b>star</b> is in the supergiant stage, which lasts only âˆ¼ 10 ^ 4 years, so effects of mass loss by He winds are small. Since {{the removal of the}} hydrogen envelope of the <b>massive</b> <b>star</b> occurs so late, it evolves essentially as a single star, rather than one in a binary. Thus, we can use evolutionary calculations of Woosley & Weaver (1995) of single stars. We find that the black holes in transient sources can be formed from stars with ZAMS masses in the interval 20 - 35. The black hole mass is only slightly smaller than the He core mass, typically âˆ¼ 7. Comment: 19 pages, substantial changes, accepted in New Astronom...|$|R
