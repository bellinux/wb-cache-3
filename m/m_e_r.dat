Kelly's instrumental feat Nas [...] "Have you ever thought" [...] the song hit number one charts in all of the Arab radios bringing DAM to the Palestinian mainstream and making them the group with the largest following and to a non stop shows in the years 2000 till 2003, a lot of Rappers and Hip Hop bands started their career after that single, the whole Palestinian Hip Hop scene started to spread, studios were opened and workshops for self-expression though rhymes started around. Around 2001, after a Palestinian suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, a few Extremist Israelis gathered around the Hassan Beck mosque in Yafa throwing stones at it and screaming Death to the Arabs, and Terrorists, DAM released their breakthrough single [...] "Meen Erhabi? - Who is the terrorist?" [...] the song opens with the screaming of the Israelis in front of the mosque, then over the Atmosphere instrumental [...] "If I was Santa" [...] they rap their verses. the song created an International buzz and was downloaded more than a million time in one month, The French magazine The Rolling Stone made a big article about the song and released a compilation with that magazine that featured DAM's Meen Erhabi and other International artists such as Manu Chao and Zibda, at that same time, Udi Aloni released his second documentary [...] "Local Angel" [...] that also featured DAM and they toured around Europe with the film, the tour included France, Germany and Belgium and {{it was the beginning of}} DAM's international career. Later on a video clip of the song was made by Palestinian/Syrian director Jackie Salloum.|$|E

40|$|The idea {{of design}} and {{building}} the Educational Multifunctional Electronic Robotic Kit (E. <b>M.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>R.</b> K) as teaching aids is to enhanced the process {{of teaching and learning}} easily and practically for each subtopic in the introduction to robotic topic of Electrical and Electronic Engineering Studies Form 5 subject in Technical Secondary School. The produce of this kit {{can be seen as the}} initiative to enhance activities based on hands on method of teaching and learning. The purpose of this project is to build a teaching aid called the Educational Multifunctional Electronic Robotic Kit (E. <b>M.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>R.</b> K) that can help and motivate students toward learning the introduction to robotic topic during the lesson in class. Secondly, it is to evaluate the design of the robotic kit and furthermore to test the functionality of this educational robotic kit. Moreover, with the complete and explicit content of lab sheets on how the robot and the programming of PLC works, it can help teachers deliver the process of teaching and learning in the systematic way. In the process of designing kit, researcher selected the ADDIE Model as the elements towards developing product design that contain analysis phase, design phase, development phase, implementation phase and evaluation phase. The effectiveness of using E. <b>M.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>R.</b> K is tested toward teacher that teach PLC topic in Technical Secondary School with the teacher test using it along with answering questionnaire. The results and feedback are positive and teacher loves using it and it actually help them in the process of teaching and learning. As a conclusion, E. <b>M.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>R.</b> K that involve PLC and robotics successfully developed and built as a teaching kit to help the process of teaching and learning for teachers and students for the topic introduction to robotic in the Electrical and Electronic Engineering Studies subject...|$|E
40|$|<b>M.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>R.</b> – 'The {{right to}} a place of honour' as the author of children’s books A {{recognition}} of <b>M.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>R.</b> ’s writing developed late in her career. One of the reasons for this was most probably that she was almost exclusively involved in writing for children in the 1920 s and early 1930 s. Her many publications for children included not only “Kinders van die Voortrek” and the well-known “Karlien en Kandas”, but many more. It was only in the late 1940 s after she had published books for adults that she received recognition for her work – which did not happen in the case of her earlier children’s books. Although she is at present regarded as a pioneer of children’s literature, these books have still not been accepted as part of the canon. This article attempts to indicate why she is considered a pioneer by situating her work in the literary context of the time. By analysing the individual books for children as texts in their own right, the article demonstates that dichotomising her work into literature for children and literature for adults is not justified. From the onset till the end of her career <b>M.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>R.</b> ’s publications form one continuous oeuvre. The same trends observable in her early work for children are present in the later work for adults...|$|E

40|$|Superposing annual {{patterns}} of oldfield mouse movement and popula-tion numbers indicates emigration {{is important in}} limiting peak densities however, emigration apparently is not the major cause of declining po-pulation numbers following peak densities. Dispersal from small mammal populations is one process affecting and possibly limiting population numbers (L i d i c k <b>e</b> <b>r,</b> 1962; <b>M</b> y <b>e</b> <b>r</b> s & K <b>r</b> <b>e</b> b s, 1971). Prohibiting emigration and immigration by enclosing a population with a fence is one technique used to investigate the import-ance of dispersal as a regulating agent. Fenced populations increase to abnormally high densities and fencing appears to inhibit natural regulat-ing mechanisms (K <b>r</b> <b>e</b> b s et al., 1973). When emigration is an important cause of periodic declines in small mammal density, then increased mov-ement should accompany decreasing population numbers. However, dispersal in voles is not associated with population declines, but is most common when numbers are increasing (<b>M</b> <b>e</b> y <b>e</b> <b>r</b> s & K <b>r</b> <b>e</b> b s, 1971) ...|$|R
