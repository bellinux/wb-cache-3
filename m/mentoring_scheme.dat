40|$|Orientation: Mentoring is {{considered}} to be such an important contributor to accelerated people development in South Africa that structured <b>mentoring</b> <b>schemes</b> are often used by organisations. There are at present few sources of development and support for coordinators of such schemes. Research purpose: The aim of this research is to discover what the characteristics of coordinators of structured <b>mentoring</b> <b>schemes</b> in South Africa are, what is required of such coordinators and how they feel about their role, with a view to improving development and support for them. Motivation for the study: The limited amount of information about role requirements for coordinators which is available in the literature is not based on empirical research. This study aims to supply the empirical basis for improved development and support for coordinators. Research design and method: A purposive sample of 25 schemes was identified and both quantitative and qualitative data, obtained through questionnaires and interviews, were analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Main findings: Functions of coordinators tend to be similar across different types of <b>mentoring</b> <b>schemes.</b> A passion for mentoring is important, as the role involves many frustrations. There is little formalised development and support for coordinators. Practical/managerial implications: The study clarifies the functions of the coordinator, offers a job description and profile and makes suggestions on how to improve the development of the coordinator’s skills. Contribution/value-add: An understanding of what is required from a coordinator, how the necessary knowledge and skills can be developed and how the coordinator can be supported,adds value to an organisation setting up or reviewing its structured <b>mentoring</b> <b>schemes.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} NHS doctors' perceived {{benefits of}} being involved in <b>mentoring</b> <b>schemes</b> and to explore the overlaps and relationships between areas of benefit. Design Extended qualitative analysis of a multi-site interview study following an interpretivist approach. Setting Six NHS <b>mentoring</b> <b>schemes</b> across England. Main outcome measures Perceived benefits. Results While primary analysis resulted in lists of perceived benefits, the extended analysis revealed three overarching areas: professional practice, personal well-being and development. Benefits appear to go beyond a doctor's professional role to cross the personal–professional interface. Problem solving and change management seem to be key processes underpinning the raft of personal and professional benefits reported. A conceptual map was developed to depict these areas and relationships. In addition secondary analysis suggests that in benefitting one area mentoring may lead to consequential benefits in others. Conclusions Prior research into mentoring has mainly taken place in a single health care sector. This multi-site study suggests that the perceived benefits of involvement in mentoring may cross the personal/professional interface and may override organizational differences. Furthermore the map developed highlights the complex relationships which exist between the three areas of professional practice, personal wellbeing and personal and professional development. Given the consistency of findings across several studies it seems probable that organizations would be strengthened by doctors who feel more satisfied and confident in their professional roles as a result of participation in mentoring. Mentoring may have the potential to take us beyond individual limits to greater benefits and the conceptual map may offer a starting point for the development of outcome criteria and evaluation tools for <b>mentoring</b> <b>schemes...</b>|$|R
