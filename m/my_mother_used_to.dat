25|$|The Church {{had been}} {{practically}} abandoned {{for some years}} and was in a bad state of delapidation, but the beautiful carved work {{that had been done}} by William Bernard Sears, soon after the church was built, had not then been molested. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> sit in the church and read the Lord's Prayer and Ten Commandments over the Chancel, and admire the gilded dove that Mr. Sears had placed high over the Pulpit. The 'Eye' which he also had made seemed to be looking at her no matter where she sat.|$|E
500|$|Tricky {{explained}} Maxinquayes {{title in}} an interview with Simon Reynolds: [...] "Quaye, that's this race of people in Africa, and 'Maxin,' that's my mum's name, Maxine, and I've just taken the E off"; Reynolds interpreted this as a [...] "place name" [...] similar to the Rastafarian idea of Zion. In another source, Tricky was reported as saying Quaye had also been his mother's surname. According to Greg Kot, his mother's name provided the album its title while her suicide, along with his father abandoning him and Tricky's lack of moral sense as a youth, helped inform his [...] "unsentimental grasp on reality", which was reflected in Maxinquayes [...] "collision of beauty and violence". In the opinion of Stylus Magazines Kenan Hebert, who called it [...] "a document of obsession, mistrust, misconduct, solipsism, and sociopathy", the songs dealing with dysfunctional sexual relationships and fear of intimacy were given a Freudian angle by his mother's influence on the album, including Tricky's reference to her on [...] "Aftermath". In an interview for The Wire, Tricky explained his mother's influence and his use of female vocalists like Topley-Bird: [...] "My first lyric ever on a song was 'your eyes resemble mine, you'll see as no others can'. I didn't have any kids then... so what am I talking about? Who am I talking about? <b>My</b> <b>mother...</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> write poetry but in her time she couldn't have done anything with that, there wasn't any opportunity. It's almost like she killed herself to give me the opportunity, my lyrics. I can never understand why I write as a female, I think I've got my mum's talent, I'm her vehicle. So I need a woman to sing that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nilsson's autobiography, Mina minnesbilder (My memoirs in pictures) was {{published}} in Stockholm in 1977. She retired in 1984 to her childhood home in the Skåne province of southern Sweden, where {{her father had been}} a sixth-generation farmer and she had worked to grow beets and potatoes until she was 23. In an interview in the mid-1990s, she appeared happy, serene and as unpretentious as ever. [...] "I've always tried to remember what <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> tell me", she said. [...] "Stay close to the earth. Then when you fall down, it won't hurt so much." ...|$|E

25|$|The {{nature of}} oral {{tradition}} {{is evident in}} Leyendas de Guatemala, {{as shown in the}} dedication: “To <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> who <b>used</b> <b>to</b> tell me stories.” This reflects the traditional character of the origin of the stories, in which Asturias takes collective memory to a higher level of awareness through his fictionalization.|$|R
6000|$|... "With all my heart," [...] said Allan, in his good-humored way. [...] "I know lots of tunes, but {{the worst}} of it is, the words escape me.

2500|$|Information and Broadcasting {{minister}} Manish Tewari said, [...] "The {{film industry}} has {{lost one of}} its most versatile singers. Shamshadji's style of singing set new benchmarks. Her melodious voice with powerful lyrics gave us songs that have remained popular even today." [...] Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said [...] "She was an artist of extraordinary talent and abilities, and the songs she has left behind in her long career, which she started with AIR in 1937, will continue to enthral music lovers." [...] Her daughter Usha Ratra said [...] "She kept herself away from glamour of the industry despite being one of the top singers of her era as she did not like limelight. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> say that artistes never die. She wanted to be remembered for her songs." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a young singer Brown was {{influenced}} by older contemporaries such as Delroy Wilson (whom he later cited as the single greatest influence on his style of singing), Errol Dunkley, John Holt, Ken Boothe, and Bob Andy. Brown's first recording was an original song called [...] "Lips of Wine" [...] for producer Derrick Harriott, but when this was not released, he recorded for Clement [...] "Coxsone" [...] Dodd's Studio One label, and his first session yielded the single [...] "No Man is an Island", recorded when Brown was aged twelve and released in late 1969. The single received steadily increasing airplay {{for almost a year}} before becoming a huge hit throughout Jamaica. Brown recorded up to a dozen sessions for Dodd, amounting to around thirty songs, and also worked as a backing singer on sessions by other artists, including providing harmonies along with Horace Andy and Larry Marshall on Alton Ellis's Sunday Coming album. Brown was advised by fellow Studio One artist Ellis to learn guitar to help with his songwriting, and after convincing Dodd to buy him an instrument, was taught the basics by Ellis. These Studio One recordings were collected on two albums, No Man is an Island and If I Follow my Heart (the title track penned by Alton Ellis), although Brown had left Studio One before either was released. He went on to record for several producers including Lloyd Daley ("Baby Don't Do It" [...] and [...] "Things in Life"), Prince Buster ("One Day Soon" [...] and [...] "If I Had the World"), and Phil Pratt ("Black Magic Woman", [...] "Let Love In", and [...] "What About the Half"), before returning to work with Derrick Harriott, recording a string of popular singles including [...] "Silhouettes", [...] "Concentration", [...] "He Can't Spell", and [...] "Musical Heatwave", with the pick of these tracks collected on the Super Reggae and Soul Hits album in 1973. Brown also recorded for Vincent [...] "Randy" [...] Chin ("Cheater"), Dennis Alcapone ("I Was Lonely"), and Herman Chin Loy ("It's Too Late" [...] and [...] "Song <b>My</b> <b>Mother</b> <b>Used</b> <b>to</b> Sing") among others, with Brown still at school at this stage of his career.|$|E

6000|$|... "Of course not, child; I'm {{glad to see}} you fond of your book, and to find Rose {{helping you}} along. <b>My</b> blessed <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> sit at work with her maids about her, {{teaching}} them many a useful thing in the good old fashion that's gone by now.

6000|$|... "Because {{you looked}} at me just as <b>my</b> little <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> do {{when she wanted to}} kiss me. As a rule, I don't like to be kissed. Boys don't. You know, Miss Lewis. But I think I rather like to have you kiss me. And of course I'll come to see you again. I think I'd like to have you for a {{particular}} friend of mine, if you don't object." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My memory’s {{as good as}} ever it was," [...] he said complacently. [...] "Sometimes I forget things, {{but they}} come back. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be the same, and she lived to ninety-three." ...|$|E

60|$|Every {{month that}} evil spirit {{brought about a}} slump in our mutual love. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> read the thing and become {{depressed}} and anxious for my spiritual welfare, used to be stirred to unintelligent pestering....|$|E
6000|$|... "The place he's {{been living}} at is Paris," [...] said Humphrey, [...] "and {{they tell me}} 'tis where the king's head was cut off years ago. <b>My</b> poor <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> {{tell me about that}} business. 'Hummy,' she <b>used</b> <b>to</b> say, 'I was a young maid then, and as I was at home ironing mother's caps one {{afternoon}} the parson came in and said, [...] "They've cut the king's head off, Jane; and what 'twill be next God knows."'" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Page 280," [...] he began. [...] "Law of {{husband and}} wife. Here's a bit I don't understand, to begin with: 'It may be {{observed}} generally {{that the law}} considers marriage {{in the light of}} a Contract.' What does that mean? I thought a contract was the sort of a thing a builder signs when he promises to have the workmen out of the house in a given time, and when the time comes (as <b>my</b> poor <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> say) the workmen never go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{does n't}} hear from us. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> write to {{her for a while}} after she left Europe, but she has given it up." [...] She paused a moment, and then she added--"Blanche is too silly!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! yes, Brant of The Hague, of whom <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> speak, {{saying that}} they were kinsmen to be proud of, {{although}} she had met them but little. Well, welcome, cousin; I trust that we shall be friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|Their greeting, too, was {{conventional}} enough, and {{he turned}} and walked with her up the lane, and halted before the lilacs. [...] "You have Mrs. Forsythe's house," [...] he said.

6000|$|... "Not {{quite so}} much, sergeant, {{not quite so}} much; but I'se no fool, and <b>my</b> old <b>mother</b> she <b>used</b> <b>to</b> make {{medicine}} for de plantation and knew a heap about herbs, so it am natural dat I should take to it. What can I gib you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess I must speak," [...] {{she thought}} wistfully. [...] "I hate to do it. I always did hate meddling. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> always <b>used</b> <b>to</b> say that ninety-nine {{times out of}} a hundred the last state of a meddler and them she meddled with was worse than the first. But I guess it's my duty. I was Margaret's friend, {{and it is my}} duty to protect her child any way I can. If the Master does go back across there to meet her I must tell him what I think about it." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> poor, dear <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> say {{she liked}} to see me eat, and {{it has always been}} a {{pleasant}} reflection to me since that I must have given her much gratification in that direction. A growing, healthy lad, taking plenty of exercise and careful to restrain himself from indulging in too much study, can generally satisfy the most exacting expectations as regards his feeding powers.|$|R
6000|$|DORA. Scorn! I hate scorn. A soul with no religion-- <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> {{say that}} such a one Was without rudder, anchor, compass--might be Blown everyway with every gust and wreck On any rock; and tho' you are good and gentle, Yet if thro' any want-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, darling," [...] she whispered, [...] "you must {{just take}} one of these. It's nothing new; they're what <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> give me at your age. And for one hour you must {{go out and get}} some fresh air, and then you can come back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{whatever}} {{word you}} {{may choose to}} use when you speak to me as my wife. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> call me John; the children call me Jack; my friends call me Hampstead. Invent something sweet for yourself. I always call you Marion because I love the sound so dearly." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{she reached}} the house, she gave another proof of her identity. My father had often hinted that she seldom {{conducted}} herself like any ordinary Christian; and now, instead of ringing the bell, she came and looked in at that identical window, pressing {{the end of her}} nose against the glass to that extent, that <b>my</b> poor dear <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> say it became perfectly flat and white in a moment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mayhap, Quatermain, for {{who knows}} the {{infinite}} mercy of whatever made us as we are? <b>My</b> old <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> preach of it and I remember her words now. But in my case I expect it will stop at hope, or sleep, and if it wasn't for Inez, I'd not mind so much, for I tell you I've {{had enough of the}} world and life. Look, there's one of them. Take that, you black devil!" [...] and lifting his rifle he aimed and fired at an Amahagger who appeared upon the edge of the fold of ground. What is more he hit him, for I saw the man double up and fall backwards.|$|R
60|$|He {{promised her}} to soften his behaviour, and bid her assure {{me that he}} loved me as well as ever, {{and that he had}} so such design as that of sending me to a madhouse, {{whatever}} he might say in his passion; also he desired <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the same persuasions to me too, that our affections might be renewed, and we might lie together in a good understanding as we <b>used</b> <b>to</b> do.|$|R
6000|$|... "There was {{the wife}} of a clergyman <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> tell of," [...] said the Woman of the World, [...] "who kept copies of her husband's sermons. She would read him {{extracts}} from them in bed, in place of curtain lectures. She explained it saved her trouble. Everything she felt she wanted to say to him he had said himself so much more forcibly." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> say to me: [...] "Never {{expect to}} find brains in a pretty girl." [...] Perhaps she said it because I was not a pretty girl and she wished to {{encourage}} me. In any event, that absurd notion of the ancients that when the fairies bestow the gift of beauty on a baby they withhold all other qualities has so often been disproved that we may well disregard it.|$|E
60|$|During {{this time}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be {{frequently}} telling me old stories {{of her former}} adventures, which, however, were no ways pleasant to me; for by it, though she did not tell it me in plain terms, yet I could easily understand, joined with what I had heard myself, of my first tutors, that in her younger days she had been both whore and thief; but I verily believed she had lived to repent sincerely of both, {{and that she was}} then a very pious, sober, and religious woman.|$|E
60|$|In {{spite of}} all the scourgings I {{suffered}} at that school to make me love my book, I cannot but look back upon the place with fondness. Indeed, I considered this frequent flagellation as the common lot of humanity, and the regular mode in which scholars were made. <b>My</b> kind <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> lament over <b>my</b> details of the sore trials I underwent in the cause of learning; but my father turned a deaf ear to her expostulations. He had been flogged through school himself, and swore {{there was no other way}} of making a man of parts; though, let me speak it with all due reverence, my father was but an indifferent illustration of his own theory, for he was considered a grievous blockhead.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 1917, when I {{had been at the}} Ritz seven years, I {{reflected}} upon the potato and leek soup of my childhood which <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and grandmother <b>used</b> <b>to</b> make. I recalled how during the summer my older brother and I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> cool it off by pouring in cold milk and how delicious it was. I resolved to make something of the sort for the patrons of the Ritz.|$|R
2500|$|Though {{money was}} tight {{and the family}} was forced to move often, Laura kept them together. Mazie Hirono {{recalled}} {{that she and her}} brother <b>used</b> <b>to</b> get a dime {{once or twice a week}} from their mother. [...] "We both had baseball piggy banks. My older brother spent all his dimes but I saved mine. But one day I came home and the dimes were gone. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> had <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it <b>to</b> buy food." ...|$|R
