40|$|Monte carlo {{simulation}} {{was used}} to compare four methods for measuring individual change in terms of recovery of true change: two classical test (CT) methods, one CT-based item response theory (IRT) method, and an adaptive <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> (AMC) procedure. The conditions manipulated to evaluate the recovery of true change were (1) the Time 1 trait level, the magnitude and variability of true change at Time 2, and (3) the discrimination of the tests. Results indicated that the CTs used to measure change were heavily affected by the range of θ to which the test was targeted and by the item discrimination level of the test. Scoring of the CTs using IRT methods resulted in improved <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>change.</b> The AMC method provided the best <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> and was able to identify significant individual change with substantially reduced numbers of items...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{traditional}} {{approach to the}} <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> presents important drawbacks (no information at individual level, ordinal scores, variance of the measurement instrument across time points), which Rasch models overcome. The article aims to illustrate {{the features of the}} <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> with Rasch models. Methods: To illustrate the <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> using Rasch models, the quantitative data of a longitudinal study of heart-surgery patients (N= 98) were used. The scale "Perception of Positive Change" was used as an example of measurement instrument. All patients underwent cardiac rehabilitation, individual psychological intervention, and educational intervention. Nineteen patients also attended progressive muscle relaxation group trainings. The scale was administered before and after the interventions. Three Rasch approaches were used. Two separate analyses were run on the data from the two time points to test the invariance of the instrument. An analysis was run on the stacked data from both time points to measure change in a common frame of reference. Results of the latter analysis were compared with those of an analysis that removed the influence of local dependency on patient measures. Statistics t, Χ 2 and F were used for comparing the patient and item measures estimated in the Rasch analyses (a-priori α=. 05). Infit, Outfit, R and item Strata were used for investigating Rasch model fit, reliability, and validity of the instrument. Results: Data of all 98 patients were included in the analyses. The instrument was reliable, valid, and substantively unidimensional (Infit, Outfit< 2 for all items, R=. 84, item Strata range= 3. 93 - 6. 07). Changes in the functioning of the instrument occurred across the two time, which prevented the use of the two separate analyses to unambiguously measure change. Local dependency had a negligible effect on patient measures (p≥. 8674). Thirteen patients improved, whereas 3 worsened. The patients who attended the relaxation group trainings did not report greater improvement {{than those who did not}} (p=. 1007). Conclusions: Rasch models represent a valid framework for the <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> and a useful complement to {{traditional approach}}es. © Anselmi et al...|$|E
40|$|Linear {{logistic}} {{models with}} relaxed assumptions (LLRA) as introduced by Fischer (1974) are a flexible {{tool for the}} <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> for dichotomous or polytomous responses. As opposed to the Rasch model, assumptions on dimensionality of items, their mutual dependencies {{and the distribution of}} the latent trait in the population of subjects are relaxed. Conditional maximum likelihood estimation allows for inference about treatment, covariate or trend effect parameters without taking the subjects' latent trait values into account. In this paper we will show how LLRAs based on the LLTM, LRSM and LPCM can be used to answer various questions about the <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> and how they can be fitted in R using the eRm package.
