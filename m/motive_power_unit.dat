Locomotive 11 is intended (once fully in service) as the main diesel <b>motive</b> <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> for both works trains and out of season passenger trains, supported by the lighter diesel locomotives 5 and 6, which are currently the main works and shunting units.|$|E
5000|$|The {{installation}} machinery {{carries a}} drum of {{fibre optic cable}} along the host conductor on the overhead line, passing the drum around and around the conductor. The machine pays out the cable at a controlled tension and wraps the cable around the host conductor at a helical pitch of about 1 metre. The wrapping machine may be pulled by hand using a rope from the ground {{or it may be}} self-propelled and radio controlled. Motive power may be provided by a petrol engine or a battery pack. The <b>motive</b> <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> may be built into the wrapping machine or it may be a separate unit. Separate units are frequently called [...] "Tug" [...] or [...] "Puller" [...] and have the advantage that two smaller pieces of equipment are easier to handle {{at the top of a}} tower or pole than one big piece.|$|E

5000|$|Two sets (each {{of three}} units, A-B-B) (...) were {{produced}} in 1937 for named passenger trains; {{the first set}} (SF-1, SF-2, and SF-3) for the City of San Francisco. These motive-power sets were jointly {{owned and operated by}} the Union Pacific Railroad, the Chicago and North Western Railway, and the Southern Pacific Railroad. The second A-B-B set (LA-1, LA-2, and LA-3) was used for the City of Los Angeles; and, was jointly owned and operated by the UP and CNW only. The first locomotive <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> was the control cab, or [...] "A" [...] unit, while the other two were cabless boosters, or [...] "B" [...] units. The control cab and booster units were designed for multiple unit operation (the first in diesel <b>motive</b> <b>power).</b> A single engine crew in the cab, remotely monitored and controlled all three <b>motive</b> <b>power</b> <b>units</b> from a single control station in the cab. The locomotives were diesel-electrics with two 900 hp Winton 201-A engines each, with each engine driving its own generator to power the traction motors. In addition the locomotives contained steam generators for passenger car heating. An independent auxiliary diesel powered electric generator was housed in the first car of the train consist. This car was a combination power/baggage/post office, or crew dormitory. This car provided electric power for train-line [...] "hotel" [...] power for their named train set(s), to include the air conditioning, dining, lounge, and entertainment. The power cars were required for these train sets because of the electrical demand of their feature cars. The E2 was the third model {{in a long line of}} passenger diesels of similar design known as EMD E-units.|$|R

5000|$|In September 2008 the {{locomotive}} {{made its first}} visit to another 15" [...] gauge line, in this case, the Bure Valley Railway's Super Power event. The locomotive suffered a catastrophic <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> failure in April 2013 and was dispatched to TMA Engineering for a replacement to be fitted. At the time, the railway was already struggling for operational <b>motive</b> <b>power,</b> due to the major fire in the engineering workshops and unavailability of steam locomotives. 1929-vintage Perkins stepped up as the only available diesel locomotive available for passenger service, as Lady Wakefield was also receiving a new <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> in Birmingham, while Shelagh of Eskdale {{has been out of}} service for several years. As of May 2013, {{the locomotive}} is at TMA's workshops in Birmingham.|$|R
5000|$|In thermodynamics, <b>motive</b> <b>power</b> is {{a natural}} agent, such as water or steam, wind or electricity, used to impart motion to {{machinery}} such as an engine. <b>Motive</b> <b>power</b> {{may also be a}} locomotive or a motor, which provides <b>motive</b> <b>power</b> to a system. <b>Motive</b> <b>power</b> may {{be thought of as a}} synonym for either [...] "work", i.e. force times distance, or [...] "power".|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Any active thing always needs power. All {{productive}} tools, machines {{or working}} systems, which are so-called productive force, would need proper driving (<b>motive)</b> <b>power</b> (force) *. The <b>motive</b> <b>power</b> {{is the heart}} or core of productive force, which would always want to correspond with a definite relation of production. The different driving powers (or energy resource) with power devices are completely different in quality. Thus, the change of an important or main productive <b>motive</b> <b>power</b> in social economy would always lead to the qualitative change of relation of production, and would finally effect the change of human social-economical formation. The important task of mankind should ceaselessly find out new <b>motive</b> <b>powers</b> (energy) to satisfy the needs of new machines, new technology and new technical revolution. The important peculiarity of this article is: the development of human society was divided into five great stages, which were basically decided by the qualities and types of different <b>motive</b> <b>powers</b> of production.
