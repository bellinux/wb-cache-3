25|$|Originally, the {{silvicultural}} system now called coppicing was practiced solely for small wood production. In German {{this is called}} Niederwald, which translates as low forest. Later on in Mediaeval times farmers encouraged pigs to feed from acorns and so some trees were allowed to grow bigger. This different {{silvicultural system}} is called in English coppice with standards. In German this is called Mittelwald (middle forest). As modern forestry (Hochwald in German, which translates as High forest) seeks to harvest timber mechanically, and pigs are generally no longer fed from acorns, both systems have declined. However, there are cultural and wildlife benefits from these 2 silvicultural systems so both can be found where timber production or some other main forestry purpose (such as a protection forest against an avalanche) is not the sole <b>management</b> <b>objective</b> of the woodland.|$|E

40|$|The {{quality of}} {{environmental}} decisions are gauged {{according to the}} <b>management</b> <b>objectives</b> of a conservation project. <b>Management</b> <b>objectives</b> are generally about maximising some quantifiable measure of system benefit, for instance population growth rate. They can also be {{defined in terms of}} learning about the system in question, in such a case actions would be chosen that maximise knowledge gain, for instance in experimental management sites. Learning about a system can also take place when managing practically. The adaptive management framework (Walters 1986) formally acknowledges this fact by evaluating learning in terms of how it will improve management of the system and therefore future system benefit. This is taken into account when ranking actions using stochastic dynamic programming (SDP). However, the benefits of any management action lie on a spectrum from pure system benefit, when there is nothing to be learned about the system, to pure knowledge gain. The current adaptive management framework does not permit <b>management</b> <b>objectives</b> to evaluate actions over the full range of this spectrum. By evaluating knowledge gain in units distinct to future system benefit this whole spectrum of <b>management</b> <b>objectives</b> can be unlocked. This paper outlines six decision making policies that differ across the spectrum of pure system benefit through to pure learning. The extensions to adaptive management presented allow specification of the relative importance of learning compared to system benefit in <b>management</b> <b>objectives.</b> Such an extension means practitioners can be more specific in the construction of conservation project objectives and be able to create policies for experimental management sites in the same framework as practical management sites...|$|R
50|$|Bee pollen {{is one of}} the {{byproducts}} of the hive. Pollen {{collection is}} usually not the main <b>management</b> <b>objective.</b> Pollen is collected by installing a pollen trap at the entrance of the bee hive. There are varying designs for pollen traps. The pollen trap makes access to the hive harder for the foraging bees. In the process of climbing through the pollen trap wires some pollen is loosened from the bee's pollen basket and falls into a collection container. Varying recommendations describe leaving the pollen trap on for a few days or for more extended periods. Pollen collection works best in an area with various pollen sources throughout the year.Fresh pollen can be frozen or dried. It is used for human consumption or fed back to the colony in early spring to speed up brood production.|$|E
