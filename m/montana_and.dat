5|$|The {{tour was}} titled Best of Both Worlds Tour after {{the song of}} the same name, which was the theme to Hannah <b>Montana</b> <b>and</b> was {{released}} on the series' first soundtrack. The title was chosen because of how the concert alternates between Cyrus performing as Hannah <b>Montana</b> <b>and</b> herself. She described the tour to differentiate the two according to their respective styles and depict how one girl was able to have two sides to her. She said the most notable difference between the two characters was the style of music, rather than physical appearance. According to her, Hannah Montana was direct pop music, while her own style was more rock music-oriented and included real-life scenarios set to tunes. Cyrus rehearsed for the tour simultaneous to filming the final episodes for the second season of Hannah Montana from September to October2007.|$|E

5|$|At {{present the}} most {{informative}} sequence of dinosaur-bearing {{rocks in the}} world from the K–Pg boundary is found in western North America, particularly the late Maastrichtian-age Hell Creek Formation of Montana. This formation, when compared with the older (approximately 75Ma) Judith River/Dinosaur Park Formations (from <b>Montana</b> <b>and</b> Alberta respectively) provides information on the changes in dinosaur populations over the last 10million years of the Cretaceous. These fossil beds are geographically limited, covering only part of one continent.|$|E
5|$|Early Jurassic uplift {{created an}} {{unconformity}} above the Chinle Formation that represents about ten million years of missing sedimentation {{between it and}} the next formation, the Moenave.

The Moenave was deposited in a variety of river, lake, and flood-plain environments.|$|E

5|$|Fossilized {{remains of}} Deinonychus have been {{recovered}} from the Cloverly Formation of <b>Montana</b> <b>and</b> Wyoming and in the roughly contemporary Antlers Formation of Oklahoma, in North America. The Cloverly formation has been dated to the late Aptian through early Albian stages of the early Cretaceous, about 115 to 108 Ma. Additionally, teeth found in the Arundel Clay Facies (mid-Aptian), of the Potomac Formation on the Atlantic Coastal Plain of Maryland may be assigned to the genus.|$|E
5|$|Idaho Territory {{was created}} from Dakota Territory, Nebraska Territory, and Washington Territory on March 4, 1863. Initially, the {{territory}} included all of modern-day Idaho and <b>Montana,</b> <b>and</b> most of Wyoming. On May 26, 1864, Montana Territory was split from Idaho Territory, {{and most of}} the Wyoming portion was reassigned to Dakota Territory. The portion east of the 111th meridian was split off as part of the new Wyoming Territory on July 25, 1868, giving Idaho Territory its final borders.|$|E
5|$|In the Canadian {{portion of}} the Columbia Basin, almost half of {{which is part of}} the Kootenay River basin, there are 447 species of {{terrestrial}} vertebrates. Most of the Kootenay basin lies within the Columbia Glaciated ecoregion which encompasses much of northeastern Washington, northern Idaho, northwestern <b>Montana</b> <b>and</b> southern British Columbia. Fish fauna in the region are largely shared with those of the Columbia Unglaciated ecoregion to the south, which has about fifty species of fish and only one endemic species. There are no endemic fish within the Columbia Glaciated region itself.|$|E

5|$|Marshall died {{of heart}} failure {{at the age of}} 38 in 1939. Twenty-five years later, {{partly as a result of}} his efforts, The Wilderness Society helped gain passage of the Wilderness Act. The Act was passed by Congress in 1964 and legally defined {{wilderness}} areas of the United States and protected some nine million acres (36,000km2) of federal land. Today, Marshall is considered largely responsible for the wilderness preservation movement. Several areas and landmarks, including The Bob Marshall Wilderness in <b>Montana</b> <b>and</b> Mount Marshall in the Adirondacks, have been named in his honor.|$|E

5|$|P. c. capitalis {{is found}} in the {{southern}} Rocky Mountains from eastern Idaho, south-central <b>Montana,</b> <b>and</b> western and southern Wyoming south through eastern Utah, and western and central Colorado, to east-central Arizona and north-central New Mexico. American naturalist Spencer Fullerton Baird described this subspecies in 1873. It has a wholly whitish head with a pale band {{on the back of the}} neck, and overall more ashy grey plumage. It is also generally larger than the nominate subspecies canadensis.|$|E

5|$|The Cartman {{drug market}} subplot was heavily {{influenced}} by the 1983 crime film Scarface, with Cartman resembling fictional drug lord Tony <b>Montana</b> <b>and</b> KFC founder Colonel Sanders as antagonist Alejandro Sosa. The episode also included several jokes about Pope Benedict XVI and the child sexual abuse scandals that had been surrounding the Catholic Church at the time. The concept of a former KFC restaurant becoming a marijuana dispensary came from a news story about a real marijuana dispensary in Palms, Los Angeles, built at a site formerly housing a Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise.|$|E
