500|$|Racism also shaped {{his lifelong}} {{paradigm}} {{as a team}} player. [...] "At that time", he has said, [...] "it was never acceptable that a black player was the best. That did not happen... My junior year in college, I had what I thought was {{the one of the}} best college seasons ever. We won 28 out of 29 games. We won the National Championship. I was the [...] at the Final Four. I was first team All American. I averaged over 20 points and over 20 rebounds, and I was the only guy in college blocking shots. So after the season was over, they had a Northern California banquet, and they picked another center as Player of the Year in Northern California. Well, that let <b>me</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> if I were to accept these as the final judges of my career I would die a bitter old man." [...] So he made a conscious decision, he said, to put the team first and foremost, and not worry about individual achievements.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the largely}} {{positive}} view of Presley held by African Americans, a rumor spread in mid-1957 {{that he had}} at some point announced, [...] "The only thing Negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes." [...] A journalist with the national African American weekly Jet, Louie Robinson, pursued the story. On the set of Jailhouse Rock, Presley granted Robinson an interview, though {{he was no longer}} dealing with the mainstream press. He denied making such a statement or holding in any way to its racist view: [...] "I never said anything like that, and people who know <b>me</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I wouldn't have said it ... A lot of people seem to think I started this business. But rock 'n' roll was here a long time before I came along. Nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people. Let's face it: I can't sing like Fats Domino can. I know that." [...] Also, Red Robinson stated, [...] "Take a look at the things that are only publicized now, of how he'd be driving down the street and see a destitute black woman with a little child. He went and bought her a Cadillac. Now if this guy hated blacks, he wouldn't even have gone near them". Robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made, and on the contrary elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that Presley was anything but racist. Blues singer Ivory Joe Hunter, who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland one evening, reported of Presley, [...] "He showed me every courtesy, and I think he's one of the greatest." [...] Dudley Brooks, an African-American composer and studio musician who worked with Presley during the 1950s and 1960s, also disputed allegations that Presley was a racist. Though the rumored remark was wholly discredited at the time, it was still being used against Presley decades later. The identification of Presley with racism—either personally or symbolically—was expressed most famously in the lyrics of the 1989 rap hit [...] "Fight the Power", by Public Enemy: [...] "Elvis was a hero to most / But he never meant shit to me / Straight-up racist that sucker was / Simple and plain".|$|E

Children of every size, pregnant women, elderly people who seemed tired but happy to be there, clothing that made <b>me</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> they struggled to make it day to day, made me know they worked in farms or offices or even nearby for the government. I didn't see teenagers alone; I saw groups of teenagers with teachers.|$|E

2500|$|His {{adoptive parents}} were emotionally distant and his {{childhood}} was largely unhappy.

[...] But he was a highly intelligent school student, who left home and formal education {{at the age of}} sixteen. He dissociated himself from his adoptive family, but their teachings were to influence the themes of many of his films.|$|E

I love things British. My car is British. My wardrobe, to a good extent, is British. I even love the food in London – I think British food has shaken its prevailing perception as indigestible and become quite wonderful. I {{try to get to}} Britain for holidays as often as I can. I love things British." ...|$|E

[...] It was on an EP we called Over It that Victory Music had put out to [...] "test" [...] the waters. Since the song was really working at radio, our manager and label wanted us to also put it on our new album. We reluctantly agreed because we didn't want to blow any {{opportunities}} or ruin momentum for the band. It was a weird time. A friend of ours at the label called me one day and politely let <b>me</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> we were {{making a lot of}} mistakes with our career. We decided to fire our manager and try to get off of Victory Music.|$|E

2500|$|Reeve {{went through}} inner anguish in the ICU, {{particularly}} {{when he was}} alone during the night. His approaching operation to reattach his skull to his spine (June 1995) [...] "was frightening to contemplate. ... I already knew that I had only a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the surgery. ... Then, at an especially bleak moment, the door flew open and in hurried a squat fellow with a blue scrub hat and a yellow surgical gown and glasses, speaking in a Russian accent." [...] The man {{announced that he was}} a proctologist and was going to perform a rectal exam on Reeve. It was Robin Williams, reprising his character from the film Nine Months. Reeve wrote: [...] "For {{the first time since the}} accident, I laughed. My old friend had helped <b>me</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> somehow I was going to be okay." ...|$|E

Yes; Moral Force and 'Patience and Perseverance' are scattered to the wild winds of heaven. The music my countrymen now love best to hear is the rattle of arms and the ring of the rifle.
