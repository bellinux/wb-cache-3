40|$|Daily newspapes {{became one}} of the {{defining}} media forms of the twentieth century. Public figures were central to the appeal of newspapers, and the lives of royalty, politicians and performers were all scrutinised. Yet the history of the photographers who captured these figures in print has been largely overlooked. The exhibition'Daily Encounters' set out to redress the balance with a celebration of press portraits from the ‘Golden Age of Fleet Street’. It traces a new breed of press photographers, often from working-class backgrounds, who produced the most memorable images {{in the history of the}} medium. Emerging within the context of the National Portrait Gallery, initial research focused on examining the function of newspaper imagery as a unique form of popular iconography and collecting of the new photographs in the National Portrait Gallery’s holdings. Research was also undertaken in the Hulton Getty archive, Daily <b>Mirror</b> <b>Archive,</b> Press Association Archive and Daily Herald Archive. Original press prints and contact sheets from the period 1904 – 1985 were consulted and compared with the usage and reproduction in newspapers of the day. Daybooks, biographies and histories of individual photographers, agencies and newspapers were reviewed and interviews conducted with surviving photographers, picture editors and agency managers. The exhibition was constructed as a narrative that interweaves an exploration of four central themes: the construction of public iconography, the shifting technology of image production and its cultural application within photojournalism, the tension between truth and fiction, and the wilfully constructed mythology of Fleet Street and professional journalism. Roger Hargreaves curated this exhibition and authored the accompanying publication Daily Encounters: Photographs from Fleet Street (July 2007, ISBN 1855143771) ...|$|E

X-Ray diffraction measurements were used to test for composition segregation or crystal structure changes near the surface of the mirrors. The X-ray diffraction angles were found to be independent of the glancing angle indicating that surface composition segregation was not observed.

40|$|African Mirror, the South African-produced and world's longest running {{commercial}} newsreel, was {{a regular}} item in cinema programmes and on other exhibition circuits in South Africa from its inception in 1913. The importance of cinema newsreel has been recognised for its role as propaganda during wartime and its presence in everyday life, reaching wide audiences with representations of national and public events. The digitisation of Movietone, Pathé and other well-known newsreels has enabled scholars to access archive material and has generated detailed histories of newsreels' impact in the public realm. This article extends this analysis to African <b>Mirror.</b> The <b>archive</b> of the South African newsreel constitutes a substantial body of film, produced weekly over 70 years. Its operations extended across southern and eastern Africa, as well as North Africa during the Second World War. It was screened on cinema circuits to mainly white, but also Indian and ‘coloured’ South African audiences, the latter a category which incorporated some African audiences, and its footage was supplied to newsreels such as Pathé. This article highlights the similarity of African Mirror to other newsreels and argues that it {{played an important role}} in promoting ‘South Africanism’ in the first decades of Union. Providing an overview of its coverage of South African events, it details the conditions of production, distribution and exhibition of African Mirror, and describes how it became established as part of the cinema-going experience in South Africa between 1913 and 1948...|$|R

The N = 1 geometries in type IIB and its T-dual brane configurations are presented and they agree with the field theory analysis. We investigate the geometric transitions in the ten dimensional theories as well as in M-theory. Strong coupling effects in field theory are analyzed in the deformed geometry with fluxes. Gluino condensations are identified the normalizable deformation parameters while the vacuum expectation values of the bifundamental fields are with the non-normalizable ones. By lifting to M theory, we get a transition from finite coverings of non-hyperelliptic curves to non-hyperelliptic curves.

If you are {{the author of this}} thesis and would like to make it openly available in the Institutional Repository please contact: repository@lboro. ac. ukFor some, science fiction is simply a throwaway genre with little artistic or intellectual merit. It is certainly the case that much of the literary establishment has traditionally ignored the genre. At the same time, some science-fiction authors have sought to distance themselves from the academy and the supposed legitimation that it offers. In this thesis I oppose these necessarily reductive positions by highlighting some {{of the ways in which}} science fiction intersects with critical thought. I focus on two points of intersection in turn. Firstly, I consider the frequent references to `precariousness' in the work of science-fiction author and academic Adam Roberts. I argue that such references can be read in terms of a wider discussion on the nature of `following'. With this larger philosophical framework in mind I demonstrate in some detail how Roberts' work intersects with the writing of both Jacques Derrida and Karl Marx. I then show how the notion of `precariousness' also seems to underpin science fiction's depiction of the technological singularity. In the second half of this thesis I call attention to the fact that science fiction frequently depicts selves that are, in a manner of speaking, separated from themselves, which is to say selves that are disjointed. More specifically, I demonstrate how, in a number of science-fiction texts, the <b>mirror</b> and the <b>archive</b> operate as sites of psychical disjointedness. In doing so, I show how the genre intersects with a wide variety of critical texts, including those by both Sigmund Freud and his great acolyte Jacques Lacan, Charles Darwin and those working in the field of archive management. I then suggest that in many science-fiction texts the ocean seems to provide an alternative to this self-disjointedness; it appears to offer the experience of a kind of 'oneness' that is reminiscent both of Freud's account of 'the oceanic' in Civilization and its Discontents (1930) and Darwin's descriptions of Man's oceanic origins; it also recalls many Judaeo-Christian texts. In conclusion, I read Samuel R. Delany's The Einstein Intersection (1967) alongside several theoretical texts. During the course of this reading I question whether, having found a `way in' to the intersections between science fiction and critical thought, we can ever find a way out again. I ask: is it desirable or even possible to disentangle science fiction from critical thought? Throughout this study I draw extensively upon the interviews that I have conducted with Adam Roberts, Alastair Reynolds and Ken MacLeod. The complete transcripts of these interviews are included as an appendix...|$|R
40|$|Network {{data access}} {{services}} such as OPeNDAP enable widespread access to data across user communities. However, without ready means to restrict access to data for such services, data providers and data owners are constrained from making their data more widely available. Even with such capability, the range of different security technologies available can make interoperability between services and user client tools a challenge. OPeNDAP is a key data access service in the infrastructure under development to support the CMIP 5 (Couple Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5). The work is being carried out {{as part of an}} international collaboration including the US Earth System Grid and Curator projects and the EU funded IS-ENES and Metafor projects. This infrastructure will bring together Petabytes of climate model data and associated metadata from over twenty modelling centres around the world in a federation with a core <b>archive</b> <b>mirrored</b> at three data centres. A security system is needed to meet the requirements of organisations responsible for model data including the ability to restrict data access to registered users, keep them up to date with changes to data and services, audit access and protect ﬁnite computing resources. Individual organisations have existing tools and {{services such as}} OPeNDAP with which users in the climate research community are already familiar. The security system should overlay access control in a way which maintains the usability and ease of access to these services. The BADC (British Atmospheric Data Centre) has been working in collaboration with the Earth System Grid development team and partner organisations to develop the security architecture. OpenID and MyProxy were selected at an early stage in the ESG project to provide single sign-on capability across the federation of participating organisations. Building on the existing OPeNDAP speciﬁcation an architecture based on pluggable server side compo- nents has been developed at the BADC. These components ﬁlter requests to the service they protect and apply the required authentication and authorisation schemes. Filters have been developed for OpenID and SSL client based authentication. The latter enabling access with MyProxy issued credentials. By preserving a clear separation between the security and application functionality, multiple authentication technologies may be supported without the need for modiﬁcation to the underlying OPeNDAP application. The software has been developed in the Python programming language securing the Python based OPeN- DAP implementation, PyDAP. This utilises the Python WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) speciﬁcation to create distinct security ﬁlter components. Work is also currently underway to develop a parallel Java based ﬁlter implementation to secure the THREDDS Data Server. Whilst the ability to apply this ﬂexible approach to the server side security layer is important, the development of compatible client software is vital to the take up of these services across a wide user base. To date PyDAP and wget based clients have been tested and work is planned to integrate the required security interface into the netCDF API. This forms part of ongoing collaboration with the OPeNDAP user and development community to ensure interoperability. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Driving is {{a complex}} {{behavior}} that requires the integration of attentional, perceptual, motor and other cognitive functions. Although many studies have investigated brain activity related to driving simulation in a wide gamut of conditions, including that associated with performance impairment (e. g. alcohol intoxication [1]), {{little is known about}} the brain functional correlates of professional competitive driving, that requires greater motor and attentional skills [2, 3]. Here we used fMRI to examine functional brain activity in professional car racers as compared to naïve drivers while they watched a 'camera-car' driving of a Formula One race car. A 'passive driving' task, rather than an active one, was chosen to avoid potential confounds caused by the different skill levels between the two groups. Methods: We used fMRI (GE Signa 1. 5 T) to examine neural activity while 10 professional (24 ± 5 y) and 9 naïve (28 ± 4 y) right-handed healthy drivers watched a continuous 'camera-car' video of a Formula One car racing on four different circuits. Subjects were instructed to imagine themselves driving the car. Individual functional data were preprocessed and registered to the Talairach Atlas [4] coordinate system using AFNI [5]. Then, Inter-Subject Correlation (ISC) was used to define task-related brain regions whose neural activity temporally correlated across participants [6]. Within each group, Pearson's coefficient was computed between every pair of subjects on a voxel by voxel basis, and then averaged. Significant (FDR-corr. p < 0. 001) correlations were identified using a fully non-parametric voxel-wise permutation test (ISC-toolbox [7]). To assess additional differences between groups, we also computed a Time-Window (TW) -ISC analysis [8], using a procedure similar to that described above, but here calculating correlation coefficients within a defined 'sliding' time-frame (length: 10 TR; step: 1 TR) (FDR-corr. p < 0. 05). For each group correlation timecourses were then extracted from the ISC-peaks located in motor (M 1) and visual (V 1) brain areas to look for potential differences between professional and naïve drivers relatively to response properties of these regions. Results: In both groups, passive driving significantly modulated regional brain activity in a network of cortical areas involved in driving behavior [9], including bilateral visual cortex, precuneus, cingulate, parahippocampal, superior parietal, medial frontal and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and left precentral area (Fig. 1). However, professional drivers recruited additional cortical areas, including ventral and dorsal premotor and inferior parietal regions within the human mirror system [10] (Fig. 1 - 2). Moreover, during each video-clip, professional drivers showed stronger and more numerous correlation increases in both left and right M 1 as compared to naïve drivers, who conversely showed more correlation increases in V 1 (Fig. 3). Interestingly, in the professional racers correlation peaks in motor areas were temporally located immediately before and/or in correspondence of traits of circuit with the highest attentional demands (e. g. a series of curves). Conclusions: These results, in line with our previous findings [2], indicate that the brain functional organization developed by skilled race car drivers differs from that observed in naïve individuals. Interestingly, the different responses observed in visual and motor areas indicate that naïve drivers were characterized by a consistent modulation of brain activity in occipital cortex, while professional drivers presented a higher involvement of motor control devoted areas. In fact, while naïve drivers possess only a basic driving knowledge, professional drivers have been trained specifically in car racing and have the motor competence to effectively cope with the specific situations arising during the Formula One passive driving task. Differently put, naïve individuals simply watched the race, while professional drivers imagined to act. References: [1]. Calhoun, V. D.
