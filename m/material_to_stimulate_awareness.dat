40|$|Abstract: Many South African fashion {{designers}} are unsuccessful {{in terms of}} business and strategy, by creating products that express their own artistic design style, without sufficient consideration of specific consumer requirements. The argument is made that fashion design education that neglects the consumer in the design process could set students up for such failure. This paper reports on the second application of an action research cycle to implement an improved teaching approach. The teaching approach included an intervention <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>awareness</b> {{of the need for}} a fashion designer to integrate designer’s style with target market requirements as a strategy to produce authentic, relevant products that can add value to the consumer. In order to reflect upon and evaluate the effect of the action <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>awareness,</b> data were obtained from participants’ written reflections and design purpose statements, as well as assessment results of completed concept design illustrations. The findings of the study indicated that {{with the exception of one}} case, all the participants were able to attain levels of awareness, as was demonstrated in the assessment results of the design illustrations, which represented the visual expression of a participant’s design strategy. Nevertheless, the ability to synthesise ideas was identified as a major challenge to still address. It is clear from the findings though that the strategic principles and process facilitated through the teaching approach and the subsequent recommendations for refinement, present a viable opportunity for fashion design educators to pursue and adapt to their situations and needs...|$|R

40|$|Medical {{education}} in Australia {{is about to}} undergo major changes, with the founding of six new medical schools, including the first private medical school and the first religiously affiliated medical school in Australia. The establishment of medical schools at Bond University on the Gold Coast, Queensland, and the University of Notre Dame in Fremantle, Western Australia, are particularly noteworthy developments. A recent article in the Journal claimed the new medical schools will foster diversity and are commited to fill “particular workforce needs”. 1 We argue that increasing the range of options for medical education is not an unquestionable good, as it may threaten academic freedom and equity in medical education as well as just provision of health care. This article aims <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>awareness,</b> conversation and debate on these issues, not only within the medical community but in the wider Australian community. veli...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{proliferation}} of the Internet along with emerging {{social and economic}} imperatives are leading institutions of higher-learning to offer a large variety of online courses/programs in different disciplines. As such education becomes increasingly pervasive and legitimate in society, {{there is a need}} to critically examine its merits and pitfalls as well as the underlying assumptions driving the justification, design, and teaching of online courses. In this paper, we take a first step in this direction by uncovering myths embedded in the discourse on online learning. We examine these myths in the context of online education in our own discipline, that of Information Systems (IS). We intend the paper <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>awareness</b> and encourage debate regarding the pedagogical, administrative, economic, and societal implications of this novel though untested form of education as practiced in IS as well as in related disciplines...|$|R

40|$|Determining the {{magnetic}} connectivity between magnetospheric phenomena and ionospheric phenomena {{is an outstanding}} problem of magnetospheric and ionospheric physics. Accurately establishing this connectivity could answer a variety of long‐standing questions. The most viable option to solve this is {{by means of a}} high‐power electron beam fired from a magnetospheric spacecraft and spotted at its magnetic footpoint in the ionosphere. This has technical difficulties. Progress has been made on mitigating the major issue of spacecraft charging. The remaining physics issues are identified, together with the need for a synergistic effort in modeling, laboratory experiments, and, ultimately, testing in space. The goal of this commentary is <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>awareness</b> and interest on the magnetosphere‐ionosphere connectivity problem and possibly accelerate progress toward its solution.

40|$|False-positive {{findings}} with myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) have frequently {{been identified in}} the presence of left bundle branch block (LBBB) and tend to lower the accuracy of MPI in individuals with normal coronary angiographs. Pharmacologic stress is recognized as the preferred method for MPI in patients with LBBB. In contrast, very few studies have evaluated the effect of right bundle branch block (RBBB) on MPI, and there is no consensus regarding the selection of pharmacologic versus exercise stress during MPI for the RBBB patient. In this study, we present a 45 -year-old man with RBBB, who has a normal coronary artery angiography, but who showed abnormal myocardial perfusion with exercise MPI, and normal perfusion on dipyridamole MPI. The aim of the study is <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>awareness</b> that the stress method selected for patients with RBBB can potentially interfere with the accuracy of the data.

The goal of Requirements Engineering is to determine what properties a system should have in order to succeed. Sometimes this is relatively straightforward; but often, it is not. Some of the most vexing difficulties are social, political and/or cultural. Many requirements engineers feel that such issues fall outside the scope of their profession, and instead fall under management, interpersonal skills, or ethical quibbles; some even argue that social issues should be ignored in the requirements process, {{in order to make it}} as c [...] ...|$|R
40|$|For a {{few years}} now, {{nanotechnology}} has been recognised as a promising new growth innovator. This leads to a shift from the exploration of nanotechnology knowledge towards a phase of exploitation. The coming years this commercialisation of nanotechnology will be extended. Nanotechnology is a disruptive technology phenomenon, which leads to more difficulties in overseeing business opportunities. Additionally, the fact that high-tech small firms, especially those dealing with nanotechnology, are highly interested in developments in science and technology, begs the question how <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> the <b>awareness</b> for (new) business opportunities in nanotechnology within these firms. A promising strategy <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> learning and <b>awareness</b> of business opportunities in nanotechnology {{is the use of}} scenarios. These projections focused on uncertainty stretch the mental model of entrepreneurs and/or managers and have the ability to activate learning processes. This paper presents the (theoretical) fundaments of scenario usage in relation to the recognition of business opportunities in nanotechnology. ...|$|R

40|$|Increasingly {{the media}} and {{academic}} publications bombard audiences with exposes and theoretical discourses on aspects of White Collar Crime, with little attempt to present case studies to better improve our general understanding of this area of deviance. Accordingly an urgent need exists {{for this type of}} presentation. The following discussion attempts to contribute to the fulfillment of this need. Instead of selecting the familiar topics of shoplifting and cheque frauds as a case study, I have concentrated on the more complex and less understood area of land fraud. In using a narrative approach to reconstruct the crime, the analysis tests the dramaturgical perspective as a tool of explanation. Dramaturgy has been generally discussed theoretically {{and to a lesser extent}} used as a perspective to explain social behaviors in a one scene context. This paper has a two-fold function, a) <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>awareness</b> and increase understanding of an example of the white collar fraud act as a designed process and b) to establish the validity of this narrative approach utilizing dramaturgical analysis as a worthwhile case study review mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Background: The recent {{proliferation}} of cryptomarkets {{and the associated}} emergence of a sub-field {{of research on the}} anonymous web have outpaced the development of an ethical consensus regarding research methods and dissemination amongst scholars working in this unique online space. The peculiar characteristics of cryptomarket research, which often involves encryption, illegal activity, large-scale data collection, and geographical separation from research participants, challenge conventional ethical frameworks. A further complicating factor for reaching ethical consensus is the confluence of scholars drawn from a variety of academic disciplines, each with their own particular norms, practices and perspectives. This paper is intended <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>awareness</b> and debate, and to prompt further reflection amongst scholars studying these fascinating online phenomena. The paper explores tensions and addresses some of the more prominent and pressing ethical questions, including public vs. private online spaces, anonymity, data sharing and ownership, risks and threats to research subjects and researchers. Also discussed is how best to balance the potential harms of cryptomarket research against benefits to the public. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Professional {{development}} of teacher educators {{is an important}} issue. In {{order to be able}} to teach the teachers of the future, teacher educators have to keep their own knowledge and skills 'future proof'. When it comes to professional development, very often people think of 'attending courses'. But attending courses to keep up knowledge and/or skills, is only a small aspect of the broad range of possible activities to fill in ones professional development. A lot of professional development takes place at work, the so-called workplace-learning or informal learning. In this study we look at the professional {{development of}} teacher educators through informal learning. Often forms of informal learning are not recognized by the learner, because they are so integrated with work. In this study the goal is <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>awareness</b> of informal learning processes by teacher educators. Teacher educators use a logbook and report daily, weekly or once in three weeks what they have learned. After a three-week period they analyse their logbooks by looking at 'what is learned, 'how is learned', with or from who is learned'. This study has two types of outcomes: (1) awareness of the informal learning processes of the participating teacher educators themselves and (2) insights into the processes of <b>stimulating</b> <b>awareness</b> of informal learning processes. The study is in progress (march 2012) and we will present our findings at the conference in Antwerp...|$|R
