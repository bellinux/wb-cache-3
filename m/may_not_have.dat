5|$|Daniel B. Wallace of the Dallas Theological Seminary {{and others}} have {{suggested}} that the fragment appears to have been intentionally cut, most likely in modern times.

5|$|The castle was {{probably}} {{constructed in the}} 12th century but fell out of use soon after. It is first mentioned in 1360 and {{by then it was}} lying derelict.

5|$|The {{surviving}} Western Chalukya monuments are temples {{built in}} the Shaiva, Vaishnava, and Jain religious traditions.

5|$|About {{one percent}} of people who receive {{treatment}} for MTBI need surgery for a brain injury. Observation to monitor for worsening condition {{is an important part of}} treatment. Health care providers recommend that those suffering from concussion return for further medical care and evaluation 24 to 72hours after the concussive event if the symptoms worsen. Athletes, especially intercollegiate or professional, are typically followed closely by team athletic trainers during this period but others <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> access to this level of health care and may be sent home with minimal monitoring.|$|E
5|$|Among its {{weaknesses}} {{were the}} positioning of its gatehouse, {{on the wrong}} side of the castle, facing away from the road, and the huge windows in the hall, reaching down to the ground and making access relatively easy to any intruder. Indeed, this vulnerability may have been intentional - its builder Laurence was a newly moneyed member of the upper class, and he <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> wanted to erect a fortification that would have threatened the established Marcher Lords in the region.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{began in}} 1828, however, it was {{suspended}} in June 1831 before {{the building has}} risen from its foundations. This may have been because the principal architect Harrison had died the previous year and Boffo working alone <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been an option – his alterations to Harrison's plans for the Governor's residence in Odessa had been unfavourably received.|$|E
5|$|Croyle {{lost all}} six games {{that he started}} for the Chiefs in the 2007 season. Despite his poor {{performance}} as a starter, Croyle's statistics {{were considered to be}} hard to evaluate.

5|$|Denied episcopal office, Wilfrid {{spent the}} three years from 665 to 668 as abbot of the monastery at Ripon. He {{occasionally}} performed episcopal functions in Mercia and Kent, but never did so north of the river Humber. The historian James Fraser argues that Wilfrid <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been {{allowed to return to}} Northumbria and instead went into exile at the Mercian court, but most historians have argued that Wilfrid was at Ripon.|$|E
5|$|George was {{ridiculed}} by his British subjects; {{some of his}} contemporaries, such as Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, {{thought him}} unintelligent {{on the grounds that}} he was wooden in public. Though he was unpopular in Great Britain due to his supposed inability to speak English, such an inability <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> existed later in his reign as documents from that time show that he understood, spoke and wrote English. He certainly spoke fluent German and French, good Latin, and some Italian and Dutch. His treatment of his wife, Sophia Dorothea, became something of a scandal.|$|E
