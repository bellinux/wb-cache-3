40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify the optimal frequency range for computing the pressure reactivity index (PRx). PRx is a clinical method for assessing cerebral pressure autoregulation based on the correlation of spontaneous variations of arterial blood pressure (ABP) and intracranial pressure (ICP). Our hypothesis was that optimizing the methodology for computing PRx in this way could produce a more stable, reliable and clinically useful index of autoregulation status. The patients studied were a series of 131 traumatic brain injury patients. Pressure reactivity indices were computed in various frequency bands during the first 4 days following injury using bandpass filtering of the input ABP and ICP signals. Patient outcome was assessed using the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSe). The optimization criterion was the strength of the correlation with GOSe of the mean index value over the first 4 days following injury. Stability of the indices was measured as the mean absolute deviation of the minute by <b>minute</b> <b>index</b> value from 30 -min moving averages. The optimal index frequency range for prediction of outcome was identified as 0. 018 - 0. 067 Hz (oscillations with periods from 55 to 15 s).

Nucleopore polycarbonate membranes with a pore diameter of 5 mu m and a filtering pressure of - 20 cm H 2 O were used. The results are expressed as the volume of whole blood filtered in 1 <b>minute</b> (<b>index</b> of filterability, IF). In normal subjects IF was 1. 16 +/- 0. 24. Among AMI patients IF was 0. 70 +/- 0. 30 at admission, 0. 68 +/- 017 at day 10 and 0. 78 +/- 0. 14 at day 20. These values were significantly lower than those obtained in normal subjects and in patients with non-acute coronary artery disease.

Recently proposed online semi-supervised NMF algorithms are of particular interest as they carry the two nice properties (online and semi-supervised) of classical speech enhancement approaches.

In this paper we find that these algorithms work well when it is run for less than 1 minute, but degradation of the enhanced speech signal starts to appear after 2 minutes.

A known amount of background chlorine residuals were maintained in the DN and a required number of bacteria, Escherichia coli K- 12 strain, was introduced by an injection port in the pipe-loop system. Samples were taken at various time intervals at different pipe lengths. A spread-plate count was performed to count the bacterial number. Microbial concentration and time (p＜ 0. 0001), pipe length (p＜ 0. 022), background chlorine residuals (p＜ 0. 07) and time 2 (p＜ 0. 09) were observed as significant factors.

The ramp function of variables shows that, at the microbial count of 10 ^ 6, at 0. 76 L/min, with a pipe length of 133 meters, a back ground residual chlorine of 0. 16 mg/L was enough for the complete inactivation of a microbial episode in approximately 18 <b>minutes.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Central composite design (CCD), distribution network, Escherichia coli, residual chlorine.

40|$|Abstract—MinMin, MaxMin, and Sufferage are {{constructive}} heuristics {{that are}} widely and successfully used in assigning independent tasks to processors in heterogeneous computing systems. All three heuristics {{are known to}} run in O(KN 2) time in assigning N tasks to K processors. In this paper, we propose an algorithmic improvement that asymptotically decreases the running time complexity of MinMin to O(KN log N) without affecting its solution quality. Furthermore, we combine the newly proposed MinMin algorithm with MaxMin as well as Sufferage, obtaining two hybrid algorithms. The motivation behind the former hybrid algorithm is to address the drawback of MaxMin in solving problem instances with highly skewed cost distributions while also improving the running time performance of MaxMin. The latter hybrid algorithm improves the running time performance of Sufferage without degrading its solution quality. The proposed algorithms are easy to implement and we illustrate them through detailed pseudocodes. The experimental results over {{a large number of}} real-life datasets show that the proposed fast MinMin algorithm and the proposed hybrid algorithms perform significantly better than their traditional counterparts as well as more recent state-of-the-art assignment heuristics. For the large datasets used in the experiments, MinMin, MaxMin, and Sufferage, as well as recent state-of-the-art heuristics, require days, weeks, or even months to produce a solution, whereas all of the proposed algorithms produce solutions within only two or three <b>minutes.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Parallel processors, heterogeneous systems, load balancing, independent task assignment, MinMin, MaxMin, Sufferage, constructive heuristics...|$|R

Using these ideas we have developed two compact plasma focus (CPF) devices operating in neon with high performance and high repetition rate capacity for use as an intense soft X-ray (SXR) source for microelectronics lithography. The NX 1 is a four-module system with a peak current of 320 kA when the capacitor bank (7. 8 F 4) is charged to 14 kV. It produces 100 J of SXR per shot (4 % wall plug efficiency) giving at 3 Hz, 300 W of average SXR power into 4. The NX 2 is also a four-module system. Each module uses a rail gap switching 12 capacitors each with a capacity of 0. 6 F. The NX 2 operates with peak currents of 400 kA at 11. 5 kV into water-cooled electrodes at repetition rates up to 16 Hz to produce 300 W SXR in burst durations of several minutes. SXR lithographs are taken from both machines to demonstrate that sufficient SXR flux is generated for an exposure with only 300 shots. In addition, flash electron lithographs are also obtained requiring only ten shots per exposure. Such high performance compact machines may be improved to yield over 1 kW of SXR, enabling sufficient exposure throughput to {{be of interest to}} the wafer industry.

However, this capability imposes strict placement constraints such that even exact system-level partitioning (and scheduling) formulations are not guaranteed to be physically realizable due to placement infeasibility. We first present an exact approach for hardware–software (HW-SW) partitioning that guarantees correctness of implementation by considering placement implications as an integral aspect of HW-SW partitioning. Our exact approach is based on integer linear programming (ILP) and considers key issues such as configuration prefetch for minimizing schedule length on the target single-context device. Next, we present a physically aware HW-SW partitioning heuristic that simultaneously partitions, schedules, and does linear placement of tasks on such devices. With the exact formulation, we confirm the necessity of physically-aware HW-SW partitioning for the target architecture. We demonstrate that our heuristic generates high-quality schedules {{by comparing the results}} with the exact formulation for small tests and with a popular, but placement-uanaware scheduling heuristic for a large set of over a hundred tests. Our final set of experiments is a case study of JPEG encoding—we demonstrate that our focus on physical considerations along with our consideration of multiple task implementation points enables our approach to be easily extended to handle heterogenous architectures (with specialized resources distributed between general purpose programmable logic columns). The execution time of our heuristic is very reasonable—task graphs with hundreds of nodes are processed (partitioned, scheduled, and placed) in a couple of <b>minutes.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Hardware–software (HW-SW) partitioning, linear placement, partial dynamic reconfiguration.

Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ([unk]), pulmonary artery pressure ([unk]) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) were predictive of the need for IABP, but not the outcome. Left ventricular <b>minute</b> work <b>index</b> (LVMWI) was significantly lower in those requiring IABP, right ventricular <b>minute</b> work <b>index</b> (RVMWI) was predictive of survival with IABP.

Elevated preoperative RVMWI's were associated with 80 % survival with postcardiotomy IABP; normal RVMWI's were associated with a 56 % survival with post-cardiotomy IABP. Elevated preoperative RVMWI's reflected moderate to maximal right ventricular compensatory capacity in response to depressed left ventricular function. Normal preoperative RVMWI's in the presence of depressed LVMWI's were indicative of decreased right ventricular compensatory capacity in post-cardiotomy IABP-support settings.

40|$|Objective: Previous {{studies suggest}} that hemoconcentration may be one {{mechanism}} by which acute psychological stress causes elevations of serum total cholesterol and its subfractions. Alternatively, such elevations may result from sympathetically mediated changes in lipid metabolism. This study evaluated these two hypotheses by manipulation of sympathetically mediated responses to stress using a nonselective adrenoceptor antagonist, labetalol. Method: In a 2 2 factorial design, 52 healthy male participants {{were randomly assigned to}} a stress or no-stress condition and, within each condition, were administered either labetalol or saline. Participants assigned to stress completed three cognitive and evaluative tasks lasting a total of 18 <b>minutes.</b> <b>Indices</b> of hemoconcentration (hematocrit and hemoglobin), heart rate, blood pressure, and serum lipids (total, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), free fatty acids, and triglycerides) were assessed at preinfusion and infusion baselines and after mental stress (or rest). Results: Labetalol reduced sympathetic activation, as shown by a substantial reduction in heart rate elevation during stress, but did not alter changes in blood pressure or in hemoconcentration, as indicated by equivalent increases in hematocrit and hemoglobin in the two stressed groups. Labetalol blocked stress-induced increases in free fatty acid concentrations and lowered triglyceride levels but did not influence rises in total, HDL, or LDL cholesterol among stressed subjects. However, arithmetic correction for hemoconcentration eliminated the increases in total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol. Conclusions: These findings suggest that elevations in total cholesterol and its HDL and LDL subfractions during acute stress are caused by accompanying hemoconcentration, whereas concomitant rises in free fatty acids and triglycerides result from the direct metabolic effects of sympathetic activation.

40|$|Intravenous {{infusion}} of leukotriene D 4 (LTD 4; 0. 1 - 1 0,g/kg) produced dose-related depression of myocardial contractility, stroke volume index and mean aortic blood flow index in anes-thetized monkeys. These alterations occurred {{in association with}} increments in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances, reductions in calculated left ventricular stroke and <b>minute</b> work <b>indices</b> and relatively little or no dose-dependent change in cardiac rate, mean arterial blood pressure and mean pulmonary arterial blood pressure. Left atrial pressure did not increase in response to LTD., although cardiac afterload was increased and myocardial contractility and stroke volume index were reduced. LTD 4 -induced alterations of aortic blood flow index, stroke vol-ume index and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances were sustained during a 60 -mm observation period after drug infusion. Pretreatment of monkeys with LY 1 71 883 (1 0 mg/k...|$|R

However, most studies that provide technology for discussions and minutes generations {{have focused on}} automatic recognition techniques for auditory and visual data. For example, Lee et al.
