5|$|Some {{types of}} dive profile have been named. An {{analysis}} of dive profiles logged by dive computers by the Divers Alert Network used categorization rules which {{were based on}} the fraction of the dive time spent in four depth zones: descent, bottom, multilevel, and decompression. The descent zone was defined as the part of the dive between the surface and first reaching 85% of the <b>maximum</b> <b>depth.</b> The bottom zone is the part of the dive deeper than 85% of <b>maximum</b> <b>depth.</b> The multilevel zone is ascent from 85% to 25% of <b>maximum</b> <b>depth,</b> and the decompression zone is less than 25% of maximum cepth. A square dive was defined as having more than 40% of the total dive time in the bottom zone and not more than 30% in the multilevel and decompression zones. A multilevel was defined as having at least 40% of the total dive time in the multilevel zone. All other dives are considered to be intermediate.|$|E
5|$|The lake has a <b>maximum</b> <b>depth</b> of 17feet (5.3m). The lake {{is often}} {{reported}} to be deeper, but bathymetric surveys by the Royal Park in 2010 revealed {{the design of the}} lake.|$|E
5|$|Where {{the dive}} site and {{underwater}} topography permit, divers often prefer to descend to <b>maximum</b> <b>depth</b> and slowly ascend throughout the dive. A slow ascent, and therefore slow pressure reduction, {{is a good}} decompression practice. When using a dive computer this type of profile may not require additional decompression stops. Dive computers, unlike decompression tables, measure depth and time at short intervals during the dive and calculate the exact decompression indicated by the decompression model, which for a multilevel profile will be less than for the square profile with the same <b>maximum</b> <b>depth</b> and duration.|$|E

5|$|Cheddar is a gorge {{lying on}} the {{southern}} edge of the Mendip Hills. The <b>maximum</b> <b>depth</b> of the gorge is , with a near-vertical cliff-face to the south, and steep grassy slopes to the north. The B3135 road runs along the bottom of the gorge.|$|E
5|$|In {{recreational}} diving terminology, in a {{bounce dive}} the diver descends {{directly to the}} <b>maximum</b> <b>depth,</b> spends very little time at <b>maximum</b> <b>depth</b> and ascends directly to the surface, preferably at an ascent rate recommended by the decompression model used, and making any necessary decompression stops. In commercial diving a bounce dive is any surface oriented dive, in which the diver is decompressed to surface pressure {{at the end of}} the dive and does not transfer to a hyperbaric habitat where the diver lives at pressure between dives and only decompresses at the end of a tour of duty. The duration of bottom time is not relevant in this usage.|$|E
5|$|When {{decompression}} planning {{software is}} used to produce a schedule for a planned dive, the necessary input includes a definition of the dive profile. This may be in as much detail as the user is prepared to provide and the program is capable of using, but will always specify at least <b>maximum</b> <b>depth</b> and bottom time, and may go into detail regarding recent dive history, multiple levels, gas switches, altitude and personal conservatism factors. Many dive computers have a dive planning function for which the diver selects a <b>maximum</b> <b>depth</b> and the computer displays the maximum bottom time for which no decompression stops are required.|$|E

5|$|The {{breathing}} gas mixtures {{appropriate to}} a dive depend {{to a large}} extent on the <b>maximum</b> <b>depth</b> and the decompression obligations incurred by the planned duration of the dive and the time spent at each depth. The quantity of gases required for scuba will depend on the time spent at each depth, the breathing rate of the diver, the type of breathing apparatus to be used, and reasonable allowances for contingencies.|$|E
5|$|The dive {{profile is}} often {{recorded}} {{in some way}} {{as part of a}} permanent record of the dive. <b>Maximum</b> <b>depth,</b> bottom time and any decompression required are routinely logged by most professional divers, for whom it may be a legal requirement, and by many recreational divers, for whom it is usually a recommendation of the training agencies.|$|E

40|$|In-stream grade-control {{hydraulic}} structures {{have been}} employed to reinstate riverbeds, to protect riverbanks, {{and to improve}} aquatic habitats. This paper aims to study scour phenomena and morphologies downstream of cross-vane structures installed in curved channels, and structure orientation {{with respect to the}} flow direction. Experiments have been conducted in clear-water conditions. The results showed the important effect of the channel curvature on the <b>maximum</b> scour <b>depth</b> value and position. Increasing of the bend radius leads to a decrease {{in the value of the}} <b>maximum</b> scour <b>depth.</b> The scour morphology has been classified in three types. Observations showed that the scour typology affects the <b>maximum</b> scour <b>depth</b> value. The variation of the structure orientations has been experimentally analyzed and results showed a significant effect on the <b>maximum</b> scour <b>depth</b> position...|$|R
5|$|This type of {{profile is}} common for dives at sites {{where there is a}} flat sea-bed or where the diver remains at the same place {{throughout}} the dive to work. It is the most demanding profile for decompression for a given <b>maximum</b> <b>depth</b> and time because inert gas absorption continues at maximum rate for most of the dive. Decompression tables are drawn up {{based on the assumption that}} the diver may follow a square profile.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{supplied}} divers may {{be supplied}} with a gas mixture suitable for accelerated decompression by connecting a {{supply to the}} surface gas panel and connecting it through the valve system to the divers. This allows accelerated decompression, usually on oxygen, {{which can be used}} to a <b>maximum</b> <b>depth</b> of 20ft (6m) in water for scuba and 30ft (9m) on surface supply. Surface supplied heliox bounce divers will be provided with mixtures suitable for their current depth, and the mixture may be changed several times during descent and ascent from great depths.|$|E

5|$|The {{range of}} the {{epaulette}} shark extends from the southern coast of New Guinea to the northern coast of Australia, {{as far south as}} Sydney. The Capricorn-Bunker Group of the Great Barrier Reef contains a particularly large population, with thousands estimated to inhabit the reefs around Heron Island alone. Additionally, there are unsubstantiated reports of this species from Malaysia, Sumatra, and the Solomon Islands. Epaulette sharks are found in shallow water to a <b>maximum</b> <b>depth</b> of 50m (160ft), and are often seen in water barely deep enough to cover their bodies. They prefer tidal pools, coral flats, and stands of staghorn coral.|$|E
5|$|With dive tables, it is {{generally}} assumed that the dive profile is a square dive, meaning that the diver descends to <b>maximum</b> <b>depth</b> immediately and stays at the same depth until resurfacing (approximating a rectangular outline when drawn in a coordinate system where one axis is depth {{and the other is}} duration). Some dive tables also assume physical condition or acceptance of a specific level of risk from the diver. Some recreational tables only provide for no-stop dives at sea level sites, but the more complete tables can take into account staged decompression dives and dives performed at altitude.|$|E
5|$|During World War II The German Navy {{deployed}} weather buoys (Wetterfunkgerät See — WFS) {{at fifteen}} fixed {{positions in the}} North Atlantic and Barents Sea. They were launched from U-boats into a <b>maximum</b> <b>depth</b> of ocean of 1000 fathoms (1,800 metres), limited by {{the length of the}} anchor cable. Overall height of the body was 10.5 metres (of which most was submerged), surmounted by a mast and extendible aerial of 9 metres. Data (air and water temperature, atmospheric pressure and relative humidity) were encoded and transmitted four times a day. When the batteries (high voltage dry-cells for the valves, and nickel-iron for other power and to raise and lower the aerial mast) were exhausted, after about eight to ten weeks, the unit self-destructed.|$|E

5|$|NASA astronauts train {{underwater}} {{to simulate}} the weightlessness and occasionally need to fly afterwards at cabin altitudes not exceeding 10,000 feet (3,000 meters). Training dives use 46% Nitrox and can exceed six hours at a <b>maximum</b> <b>depth</b> of 40ffw (12mfw) for a maximum equivalent air depth (EAD) of 24fsw (7 msw). NASA guidelines for EADs of 20–50fsw (6–15msw) with maximum dive durations of 100–400 minutes allow either air or oxygen to be breathed in the preflight surface intervals. Oxygen breathing during surface intervals reduces the time to fly {{by a factor of}} seven to nine times compared with air. A study by another military organization, the Special Operations Command also indicated that preflight oxygen might be an effective means for reducing DCS risk.|$|E
5|$|His {{observations}} on the part played by organisms {{in the formation of}} the various features of reefs anticipated modern studies. To establish the thickness of coral barrier reefs, he relied on the old nautical rule of thumb to project the slope of the land to that below sea level, and then applied his idea that the coral reef would slope much more steeply than the underlying land. He was fortunate to guess that the <b>maximum</b> <b>depth</b> of coral would be around 5,000ft (1,500m), as the first test bores conducted by the United States Atomic Energy Commission on Enewetak Atoll in 1952 drilled down through 4610ft (1,405m) of coral before reaching the volcanic foundations. In Darwin's time no comparable thickness of fossil coral had been found on the continents, and when this was raised as a criticism of his theory neither he nor Lyell could find a satisfactory explanation. It is now thought that fossil reefs are usually broken up by tectonic movements, but at least two continental fossil reef complexes have been discovered to be about 3,000ft (1,000m) thick. While these findings have confirmed his argument that the islands were subsiding, his other attempts to show evidence of subsidence have been superseded by the discovery that glacial effects can cause changes in sea level.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} {{between the}} major Congo and Nile drainage basins runs {{from north to}} south through Rwanda, with around 80% of the country's area draining into the Nile and 20% into the Congo via the Rusizi River and Lake Tanganyika. The country's longest river is the Nyabarongo, which rises in the south-west, flows north, east, and southeast before merging with the Ruvubu to form the Kagera; the Kagera then flows due north along the eastern border with Tanzania. The Nyabarongo-Kagera eventually drains into Lake Victoria, and its source in Nyungwe Forest is a contender for the as-yet undetermined overall source of the Nile. Rwanda has many lakes, the largest being Lake Kivu. This lake occupies the floor of the Albertine Rift along most of the length of Rwanda's western border, and with a <b>maximum</b> <b>depth</b> of , {{it is one of the}} twenty deepest lakes in the world. Other sizeable lakes include Burera, Ruhondo, Muhazi, Rweru, and Ihema, the last being the largest of a string of lakes in the eastern plains of Akagera National Park.|$|E
