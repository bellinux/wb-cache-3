40|$|We {{develop a}} general {{equilibrium}} tax model {{to evaluate the}} impacts of equal yield base broadening in indirect taxes from high rate narrow based (typically <b>manufactures)</b> <b>taxes</b> to broad based taxes (including services) such as a VAT. We capture differences in choice of mode of supply between market goods, such as manufactures, which cannot be supplied other than through the market, and self-suppliable services and informal sector supplied products. Using this formulation, {{we are able to}} provide numerical examples of welfare worsening VAT base broadening, which expands the tax base from market based manufactures, in which there are few (or no) non taxed supply possibilities, to all goods and services where such possibilities exist. We show that the usual presumption that there are welfare benefits from equal yield VAT base broadening breaks down once tax induced increases in self supply of previously non taxed goods and services and in informal sector activity (in small scale construction and other areas) are taken into account. Moreover, since untaxed informal sector supply is typically from lower income to higher income households, they gain as comparable informal sector activity is taxed under the base broadening change. We provide a calibrated version of the model, which captures Canadian base broadening accompanying the introduction of the Canadian VAT (GST) in 1990. Results show the change to have been welfare worsening in aggregate but progressive; opposite to conventional belief. Aggregate welfare losses increase sharply if pre-existing income taxes enter the analysis, since VAT induced supply side losses compound with the income tax, while consumption side tax rate variance reducing gains do not...|$|R

40|$|In November of 2014, {{hundreds}} of advanced tax agreement (ATAs) issued by Luxembourg’s Administration des Contributions Directes (Luxembourg’s Inland Revenue, or LACD) to multinational corporate taxpayers (MNCs) were made public. Using an original dataset generated from a hand-coded sample of 172 leaked documents, the Article explores LACD administrative practices in issuing ATAs. The analysis demonstrates how a jurisdiction {{can be made}} a tax-haven by administrative practices, rather than by state law. LACD cannot be reasonably viewed – as some have suggested in LACD’s defense – a passive player in MNCs’ tax avoidance schemes. Rather, LACD is best described as a manufacturer of tax arbitrage opportunities. Specifically, even when the tax laws of the jurisdictions of residence (i. e., investors) and source (i. e., investment) are harmonized, LACD produced regulatory instruments that were intended to artificially create legal differences between the tax laws of the source and residence jurisdictions. MNCs could then exploit the <b>manufactured</b> <b>tax</b> differences to their advantage. LACD collected a fee that was functionally linked {{to the amount of}} taxes avoided by MNCs in the other jurisdictions. The findings contribute {{to our understanding of the}} role of tax havens in global economy, by adding an institutional dimension to the phenomena of international tax arbitrage. Specifically, tax administrators can function as intermediaries between residence and source jurisdictions the laws of which are harmonized, and provide taxpayers with synthetic arbitrage opportunities. Hence, international coordination efforts to combat abusive tax schemes by way of advancing harmonization of tax laws may not be as effective as hoped. The Article concludes that international efforts should systematically address arbitrage manufacturing. Namely, the targets of coordinated attempts to combat international tax arbitrage should be tax administrations, and not only taxpayers...|$|R

There is one facile answer to that question; that is, they tried several other reforms first without success and the BTT was the next one that came up. But, the issue is more substantive than that, considering what are the real options for reform of the MST in Canada and given the restraints that we face in trying to deal with tax reform of this nature. As is well known, the MST is now celebrating its 62 nd birthday in its present form. After it is reformed, we can move it over to the museum of fiscal relics and either looks back fondly or otherwise. sales tax reform, the BTT, Canada...|$|R

6000|$|I {{dare say}} the noble lord is {{perfectly}} well read, because {{the duty of}} his particular office requires he should be so, in all our revenue laws, and in the policy {{which is to be}} collected out of them. Now, Sir, when he had read this act of American revenue, and a little recovered from his astonishment, I suppose he made one step retrograde (it is but one) and looked at the act which stands just before in the statute-book. The American revenue act is the forty-fifth chapter; the other to which I refer is the forty-fourth of the same session. These two acts are both to the same purpose: both revenue acts; both taxing out of the kingdom; and both <b>taxing</b> British <b>manufactures</b> exported. As the forty-fifth is an act for raising a revenue in America, the forty-fourth is an act for raising a revenue in the Isle of Man. The two acts perfectly agree in all respects, except one. In the act for taxing the Isle of Man the noble lord will find, not, as in the American act, four or fire articles, but almost the whole body of British <b>manufactures,</b> <b>taxed</b> from two and a half to fifteen per cent, and some articles, such as that of spirits, a great deal higher. You did not think it uncommercial to tax the whole mass of your manufactures, and, let me add, your agriculture too; for, I now recollect, British corn is there also taxed up to ten per cent, and this too in the very head-quarters, the very citadel of smuggling, the Isle of Man. Now will the noble lord condescend to tell me why he repealed the <b>taxes</b> on your <b>manufactures</b> sent out to America, and not the <b>taxes</b> on the <b>manufactures</b> exported to the Isle of Man? The principle was exactly the same, the objects charged infinitely more extensive, the duties without comparison higher. Why? Why, notwithstanding all his childish pretexts, because the taxes were quietly submitted to in the Isle of Man, and because they raised a flame in America. Your reasons were political, not commercial. The repeal was made, as Lord Hillsborough's letter well expresses it, to regain [...] "the confidence and affection of the colonies, on which the glory and safety of the British empire depend." [...] A wise and just motive, surely, if ever there was such. But the mischief and dishonor is, that you have not done what you had given the colonies just cause to expect, when your ministers disclaimed the idea of taxes for a revenue. There is nothing simple, nothing manly, nothing ingenuous, open, decisive, or steady, in the proceeding, with regard either to the continuance or the repeal of the taxes. The whole has an air of littleness and fraud. The article of tea is slurred over in the circular letter, as it were by accident: nothing is said of a resolution either to keep that tax or to give it up. There is no fair dealing in any part of the transaction.|$|R

50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the Union blockade and the peculiar industrial development of the Confederate States removed {{the possibility of an}} ample government revenue. Though import duties were levied, the proceeds amounted to almost nothing. A small export-duty on cotton was expected to produce a large revenue sufficient to base a loan upon, but the small amount of cotton exports reduced this source of revenue to an insignificant figure. Moreover, since few <b>manufactures</b> existed to <b>tax</b> under an internal revenue system such as the US government adopted, the Confederacy was cut off from deriving any considerable revenue from indirect taxation. The first Confederate tax law levied a direct tax of twenty million dollars, apportioned among the states. These, with the exception of Texas, contributed their apportioned share to the central government by issuing bonds or notes, so that the tax was in reality but a disguised form of loan. Real taxation was postponed until the spring of 1863, when a stringent measure was adopted taxing property and earnings. It was slowly and with difficulty put into effect, and was re-enacted in February 1864. In the states and cities there was a strong tendency to relax or postpone taxation in view of the other demands upon the people.With no revenue from taxation, and with the disastrous effects of the wholesale issue of paper money before it, the Confederate government made every effort to borrow money by issuing bonds. The initial $15 million loan was soon followed by an issue of one hundred million in bonds, which was, however, difficult to place. There followed even larger loans. The bonds rapidly fell in value, and were quoted during the war at approximately the value of the paper money, in which medium they were paid for by subscribers. To avoid this circumstance, a system of produce loans was devised by which the bonds were subscribed for in cotton, tobacco and food products. This policy was subsequently enlarged, and enabled the government to secure at least a part of the armies' food supplies. But the bulk of the subscriptions for these bonds was made in cotton, for which the planters were thus enabled to find a market.|$|R
