25|$|The cosmic {{microwave}} background is polarized {{at the level of}} a few <b>microkelvin.</b> There are two types of polarization, called E-modes and B-modes. This is in analogy to electrostatics, in which the electric field (E-field) has a vanishing curl and the magnetic field (B-field) has a vanishing divergence. The E-modes arise naturally from Thomson scattering in a heterogeneous plasma. The B-modes are not produced by standard scalar type perturbations. Instead they can be created by two mechanisms: the first one is by gravitational lensing of E-modes, which has been measured by the South Pole Telescope in 2013; the second one is from gravitational waves arising from cosmic inflation. Detecting the B-modes is extremely difficult, particularly as the degree of foreground contamination is unknown, and the weak gravitational lensing signal mixes the relatively strong E-mode signal with the B-mode signal.|$|E

50|$|William Phillips was {{influenced}} by the Wineland paper and attempted to mimic it, using neutral atoms instead of ions. In 1982, he published the first paper outlining the cooling of neutral atoms. The process he used is now known as the Zeeman slower and became one of the standard techniques for slowing an atomic beam. Now, temperatures around 240 <b>microkelvins</b> were reached. That threshold was the lowest researchers thought was possible. When temperatures then reached 43 <b>microkelvins</b> in an experiment by Steven Chu, the new low was explained by the addition of more atomic states in combination to laser polarization. Previous conceptions of laser cooling were decided to have been too simplistic. The major breakthroughs in the 70s and 80s in the use of laser light for cooling led to several improvements to preexisting technology and new discoveries with temperatures just above absolute zero. The cooling processes were utilized to make atomic clocks more accurate, improve spectroscopic measurements, and led to the observation of a new state of matter at ultracold temperatures. The new state of matter, the Bose-Einstein Condensate, was observed in 1995 by Eric Cornell, Carl Wieman, and Wolfgang Ketterle.|$|R

50|$|A {{magneto-optical}} trap (abbreviated MOT) is {{an apparatus}} that uses laser cooling with magneto-optical trapping {{in order to}} produce samples of cold, trapped, neutral atoms at temperatures as low as several <b>microkelvins,</b> two or three times the recoil limit (see Doppler cooling limit).By combining the small momentum of a single photon with a velocity and spatially dependent absorption cross section and a large number of absorption-spontaneous emission cycles, atoms with initial velocities of hundreds of metres per second can be slowed to tens of centimetres per second.|$|R
50|$|Three {{frequencies}} {{are required}} to confirm the origin of any detected signal on the sky. If the signal appears in the three instruments with the same amplitude, then it should correspond to the thermal perturbations of the Cosmic Microwave Background.

A galactic signal should have an amplitude ten times larger in the 10 GHz instrument than in the 33 GHz one.|$|R

This approach is examined here for cold but thermal atoms where the Doppler broadening is still not negligible and familiar secular approximations no longer hold. In this temperature regime higher-order momentum Fourier coherence components are shown to be important for achieving excellent agreement with a recent experiment done in cold Rb- 87 clouds at several hundred <b>microkelvins...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the adiabatic demagnetization in the {{rotating reference frame}} (ADRF) {{of a system of}} dipolar coupled nuclear spins $s= 1 / 2 $ in the external magnetic field.

For different subsystem sizes, we have found from numerical simulations the temperatures at which subsystems of a one-dimensional nine-spin chain and a plane nine-spin cluster become entangled.

Achieving BEC requires cooling the atoms beyond the limits of laser cooling, which means the lasers used in the MOT must be turned off and a new method of trapping devised.

The phase-space density {{at the end of the}} evaporation reaches unity, close to quantum degeneracy. The gain in phase-space density after evaporation is 10 ^ 3. We find that the scaling laws used for much larger numbers of atoms are still valid despite the small number of atoms involved in the evaporative cooling process. We also compare our results to a simple kinetic model describing the evaporation process and find good agreement with the data. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

Both arrays are used to observe radiation with frequencies between 12 and 18 GHz, and have very similar system designs.

40|$|The {{problem of}} deep laser cooling of ^ 24 Mg atoms is {{theoretically}} studied. We propose two-stage sub-Doppler cooling strategy using electro-dipole transition 3 ^ 3 P_ 2 → 3 ^ 3 D_ 3 (λ= 383. 9 nm). The first stage implies exploiting magneto-optical trap with σ^+ and σ^- light beams, {{while the second}} one uses a linlin molasses. We focus on achieving large number of ultracold atoms (T_eff < 10 μK) in a cold atomic cloud. The calculations have been done out of many widely used approximations and based on quantum treatment with taking full account of recoil effect. Steady-state average kinetic energies and linear momentum distributions of cold atoms are analysed for various light-field intensities and frequency detunings. The results of conducted quantum analysis have revealed noticeable differences from results of semiclassical approach based on the Fokker-Planck equation. At certain conditions the second cooling stage can provide sufficiently lower kinetic energies of atomic cloud as well as increased fraction of ultracold atoms than the first one. We hope that the obtained results can assist overcoming current experimental problems in deep cooling of ^ 24 Mg atoms by means of laser fields. Cold magnesium atoms, being cooled in large number down to several <b>microkelvins,</b> have certain interest, for example, in quantum metrology. Comment: 11 pages, 7 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} and characterizes a setup {{to conduct}} experiments combining {{the fields of}} cold atoms and nanophotonics. Furthermore, a series of numerical simulations is employed to deepen of atom transport under experimentally realistic conditions. The study of cold atoms is usually fundamental in nature and a very clean approach to investigate the laws of physics. High purity samples of atoms are cooled down to millikelvins or <b>microkelvins.</b> The potential landscape for the atoms can be carefully controlled using lasers and/or magnetic fields. Since the atoms' responses to electric, magnetic or electromagnetic fields are known with very high fidelity, any deviations to the state the atoms are prepared in can be precisely measured. Nanophotonics {{is the study of}} light close to or beyond the diffraction limit. In this region the field-like nature of light starts to play a role. By confining light in sub-wavelength-sized structures, high peak intensities can be achieved, giving rise to exciting non-linear optics phenomena. The strong field gradient that can be created allows, for instance, precise spectroscopy measurements, phase-sensitive sub-wavelength microscopy, as well as producing highly receptive sensing devices. Combining cold atoms and nanophotonics creates strong synergy effects. It gives access to strong coupling of light and matter. The scalability of nanophotonics now extends to atomic physics. Atoms can be trapped, coupled and manipulated at very small length scales, and in large numbers. Moreover, the potential landscape for atoms is highly customizable. The rubidium isotope 87 is used in this setup. A cloud of rubidium atoms is gathered and cooled in a two dimensional magneto-optical trap (MOT). Since the atoms are only cooled in two dimensions, they are free to escape in the third dimension and load a following three dimensional MOT. The atoms are now cooled further, compressed and loaded into an optical dipole trap. This dipole trap transports the atoms close to a sample inside the vacuum chamber. A moving optical lattice, or optical conveyor belt, brings the atoms then close to the sample surface. Now experiments can be conducted, studying the interaction of cold atoms and strongly confined light. The atom transport down to the sample surface shows some unexpected behaviour: the atoms seem to spread through the optical lattice during transport. A combination of microscopic and macroscopic numerical simulations, including genetic algorithms, are used to deepen our understanding of the underlying physics. This also allows us to get access to experimental variables that cannot be directly obtained...|$|R
