40|$|Factors {{affecting}} <b>milking</b> <b>efficiency</b> in pasture-based dairy {{systems were}} explored in this thesis. An industry {{survey was conducted}} on 61 commercial farms with rotary dairies to benchmark current levels of <b>milking</b> <b>efficiency</b> on-farm. Benchmarks calculated included; cow throughput (cows milked per hour), milk throughput (kg of milk harvested per hour), the operator efficiency values of these benchmarks and cluster utilisation. It was possible to milk more cows per hour in larger rotary dairies, however operator efficiency peaked at 60 bails. There was a range of performance within a given rotary size and platform speed was identified {{as one of the}} determining factors. The second experiment modelled the effect of platform speed and rotary size on throughput using milking duration data collected during the benchmarking study. Faster platform speeds increased the number of cows requiring multiple rotations to complete milking, but this did not decrease throughput. A further factor that may affect throughput is individual cow milk yield, and consequently cow milking duration. An experiment in late lactation was set up to evaluate strategies to reduce cow milking duration by applying pre-milking stimulation or manipulating end-of-milking criteria. Pre-milking simulation decreased cow milking duration but also decreased <b>milking</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Conversely, changing end-of-milking criteria, by increasing automatic cluster removal (ACR) threshold, reduced cow milking duration by up to 80 s without compromising milk yield or somatic cell count (SCC). This was subsequently validated in peak lactation. In situations without ACR, <b>milking</b> <b>efficiency</b> must not be achieved at the expense of cow health so an experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of overmilking on teat-end hyperkeratosis. Clusters remained attached for 0, 2, 5 or 9 min after milk flow rate dropped below 0. 2 kg/min. Teat-end hyperkeratosis was significantly greater for the 5 and 9 min treatments than 0 and 2 min. The <b>milking</b> <b>efficiency</b> of herringbone dairies was also benchmarked on 19 commercial farms with larger dairies achieving greater throughput (in a linear relationship), due to reduced idle time, but not greater operator efficiency. Finally, the effect of rotary size, platform speed and end-of-milking criteria were evaluated in a number of scenarios to maximise operator efficiency. These were used to calculate the internal rate of return for different rotary sizes...|$|E
40|$|Very {{little is}} known about the udder characteristics, {{partitioning}} of milk in the mammary gland and efficiency of machine milking in donkeys. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of the udder and teats, milk yield in relation to pulsation rates (90, 120 and 150 cycles/min), milk partitioning in the mammary gland, composition of the spontaneously removed and residual milk fractions and <b>milking</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Forty-one healthy Martina Franca jennies in the third month of lactation and routinely milked twice daily were used in three studies. Udder characteristics were evaluated by direct measurements and ultrasonographic scanning. Residual milk was obtained by milking after an oxytocin administration (40 IU i. m.). The prevalent shapes were 'bowl' for udders and 'conical' for teats. After milking the udder characteristics decreased within a range from- 11 · 6 % (udder depth) to- 25 · 7 % (diameter of teat at the base). The internal structures of the udder resulted as several pockets of ducts empting directly into the teat. The pulsation rate of 120 cycles/min improved (P< 0 · 05) the milk yield in comparison to the 90 and 150 cycles/min, reduced the residual milk fraction, thus improved (P< 0 · 05) <b>milking</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Residual milk composition had higher (P< 0 · 05) fat content and somatic cell count than the spontaneously removed milk fraction. The udders revealed several pockets of ducts empting into the teat instead of a single cisternal cavity and showed a certain compliance.

40|$|Milk from {{dairy cows}} is a staple dietary {{component}} for humans {{all over the}} world. Regardless of whether milk is consumed in its purest, unaltered form or as high-end products such as fine cheese or ice cream, {{it needs to be}} of high quality when taken from the cow, produced at a low price and produced in a system that consider aspects such as animal health, animal welfare and sustainability. This thesis investigated the role of milk removal and the importance of residual milk on milk yield, milk composition and <b>milking</b> <b>efficiency</b> in dairy cows. The specific aspects examined were whether residual milk retained in the udder, specifically its fat component, is involved in regulation of milk synthesis and secretion and whether removal of this residual milk influences milk yield, composition and quality, measured as milk fatty acid composition and free fatty acid content. The results showed that <b>milking</b> <b>efficiency</b> could be increased by increasing the pulsation ratio or using a higher cluster or teat cup take-off threshold, without negative effects on milk yield or milk composition. Milking time in automatic milking systems could thereby be decreased by one minute per cow and milking or more. Milk fatty acid composition was affected by several treatments tested, but the content of free fatty acids and the size distribution of milk fat globules were unaffected. Residual milk yield increased both due to repeated residual milk removal and to use of a higher cluster take-off level. Residual milk removal also increased the relative proportion of short-chain fatty acids in milk. The overall conclusion of this thesis is that residual milk removal in mid-lactation dairy cows does not affect milk yield and that <b>milking</b> <b>efficiency</b> in an automatic milking system can be increased with higher takeoff levels without affecting milk yield or composition. No evidence of a regulatory mechanism in residual milk was found, but residual milk removal increased milk fat synthesis...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 9 {{multiparous}} dromedary camels in late {{stage of lactation}} (287 ± 8 DIM; 3. 8 ± 0. 8 kg/d) were used to study the effect of manual udder stimulation on machine <b>milking</b> <b>efficiency</b> of dairy camels under intensive management condition. Experimental design consisted of 3 x 3 Latin square with 9 animals allocated randomly and equally to 3 treatment (T 1 = 60 s, T 2 = 90 s and T 3 = 120 s). All camels were machine milked twice daily. Milk yield and milk flow parameters were recorded by Lactocorder® milk meters. Udder health was evaluated by California mastitis test (CMT) and somatic cell counts (SCC). Cisternal milk was determined 14 h after milking using Atosiban®. Volumes of machine milk (MM), machine stripping milk (MSM) and residual milk (RM) were recorded in duplicate. No subclinical mastitis was detected during the experimental period {{as indicated by the}} CMT ( 25 %). The increase of udder stimulation from T 1 to T 3 decreased (p< 0. 05) the lag time (LT) (3. 83 to 2. 24 sec) in camels of G 1 and the MSM (26. 6 to 14. 8 %) as well as RM (46. 1 to 31. 4 %) in camels of G 2. Bimodal curves tended (P= 0. 08) to decrease from 43. 6 % to 28. 1 % when duration of udder stimulation increased from T 1 to T 3 in camels of G 2.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to explore the effect of the level of inbreeding on <b>milk</b> <b>efficiency</b> of cows and on the content of milk components (fat and protein) in the 1 st standard lactation period (305 days). The level of inbreeding (Fx) of inbred cows ranged between 1. 25 and 12. 5 %. Efficiency parame- ters of inbred cows were compared with their contemporaries – half-sisters after the father (n= 2567), raised on the same farm whose first lactation ended in same year. Out of the total database (567, 036 cows) created in 1980 – 2002 we incorporated 885 inbred cows. To allow detailed analyses the inbred cows were divided into 3 groups according to the coefficient Fx (1. 5 – 2. 3 %, 3. 0 – 5. 0 % and 8. 0 – 12. 5 %). The database was evaluated using the analysis of variance with 8 fixed effects including the commercial type, own breeding value and breeding value of mother, average efficiency of mother, reproduction parameters (year and age at calving and interval between the 1 st and 2 nd lactation) and total number of lactations. The statistical programme SAS 8. 2 – GLM procedure (Copyright c 1999 – 2001 by SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for statistical analyses. Compared to their contemporaries the 323  kg reduction of milk production of inbred cows with the lowest value of Fx (1. 5 – 2. 3 %) was insignificant; the decrease in the relative content of fat and protein was insignificant by 0. 01 and 0. 02 %, respectively. Comparisons between contemporaries and inbred cows with Fx at the level of 3. 0 – 5. 0 % showed a highly significant 407  kg reduction in <b>milk</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The fat content in milk of inbred cows increased by 0. 11 % (p< 0. 01) and the protein content by 0. 03 % (p< 0. 05) compared to their contemporaries.

In order to facilitate the examination of milking process labour inputs, the milking process may be divided into the following three components: herding pre and post milking (transfer of cows {{to and from the}} milking parlour); milking (milking tasks / work routines within the parlour); and washing (washing of milking machine and yard). Meanwhile, within milking specifically, the number of cows milked per operator per hour is the best measure of both the performance of the operator and the milking installation (Clough, 1978). This is affected by the following three factors: the milking times of the cows, the number and arrangement of the milking units, and the operator’s work routine (Whipp, 1992). The addition of extra milking units will only increase milking performance if the operator has idle time during milking (Hansen, 1999) ...|$|E

A stochastic frontier production function was estimated using data collected in 1998 from 514 Danish dairy farms. Measures of farm-level <b>milk</b> production <b>efficiency</b> relative to this production frontier were obtained, and relationships between <b>milk</b> production <b>efficiency</b> and the incidence risk of reproductive disorders were examined. There were moderate positive relationships between <b>milk</b> production <b>efficiency</b> and retained placenta, induction of estrus, uterine infections, ovarian cysts, and induction of birth. Inclusion of reproductive management variables showed that these moderate relationships disappeared, but directions of coefficients {{for almost all}} those variables remained the same. Dystocia showed a weak negative correlation with <b>milk</b> production <b>efficiency.</b> Farms that were mainly managed by young farmers had the highest average efficiency scores. The estimated milk losses due to inefficiency averaged 1142, 488, and 256 kg of energy-corrected milk per cow, respectively, for low-, medium-, and high-efficiency herds. It is concluded that the availability of younger cows, which enabled farmers to replace cows with reproductive disorders, contributed to high cow productivity in efficient farms. Thus, a high replacement rate more than compensates for the possible negative effect of reproductive disorders.

Basic life activity of dairy cattle such as: feed intake, standing, lying and movement were monitored. All data were collected and assessed under running conditions on a private dairy farm owned by Václav Dub in Boubín near Horažďovice. The task was carried out in a reconstructed housing, where both systems are in operation. During the day, the dairy cattle remained mostly in a lying position, from which 50, 33 % were kept in stanchion housing and 49, 54 % in loose housing. When being housed in a standing position, 23, 78 % of the dairy cattle paid attention to feeding and 27, 05 % of dairy cattle were robotically milked. Standing position represented 25, 89 % in stanchion housing and 19, 31 % in loose housing. The movement was only monitored with dairy cattle housed in free housing representing 4, 1 %. After the <b>milk</b> <b>efficiency</b> was assessed, there were some statistically significant differences (P? 0, 001) found in milked milk as well as in a kilogram of protein. With respect to reproduction, the length of the insemination interval was recorded showing 129 days when being stanchion housed and 95 days when loose housed. The length of the service period of dairy cattle in stanchion housing was 144 days while dairy cattle milked robotically showed the length of 109 days. All in all, it was proved that a free movement has a positive influence on the <b>milk</b> <b>efficiency,</b> fertility as well as the welfare of dairy cattle...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{there is}} an {{increasing}} interest in camel's milk for human nutrition due to its functional properties. As a result of market demands for milk production, intensive dairy camel's farms using modern machine milking have been recently estabilished around the world. Efficient milking {{are related to the}} good milking ability of animal (machine milked). Camels should be chosen with good udder and teat conformations because of its direct effects on ease of milking and milk hygiene. There are a huge variation in size of teats (length and diameter) between camels. These variations might cause some problems during machine milking and require special settings and practice during milking. Therefore, the necessity to design specific milking clusters for lactating camels, with longer and wider cups than dairy cows. Milking camels at 50 kPa and 60 pulsations/min improved <b>milking</b> <b>efficiency</b> without affecting teat condition and udder health; camels were able to let down more milk in a shorter time at higher milk flow rate. Compared to other dairy animals, camels have a very limited cisternal cavity. Therefore, insufficient udder and teat stimulation will lead to incomplete milking. It is recommended to extend the duration of udder and teat stimulation (90 to 120 sec) before milking. Further studies are needed to confirm these results during the entire lactation period.

40|$|Milk {{harvesting}} {{practices in}} New Zealand have changed substantially {{over time in}} response to increasing herd sizes and demand for more efficient systems. Observations on 10 farms, representing a range of herd sizes and milking facilities, indicated that of the time required for milking 17 % was spent on preparation (fetching cows and setting the parlor up), 61 % on milking (attaching and removing teat cups, maintaining cow flow, attending to udder health and equipment) and 22 % of the time on post milking clean-up activities (including shutting cows away). Cows milked per hour ranged from 93 to 217 (calculated using all labor hours and excluding preparation and post-milking clean-up). Time per cow per milking ranged from 16 to 38 s. Automating the cups on task within the current batch milking systems is often suggested {{as a means of}} dramatically improving <b>milking</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The observations showed that at present attaching teat cups accounts for 19 - 39 % of time spent milking on New Zealand farms. Other activities such as fetching the herd, herd health and post-milking cleaning account for the bulk of the time required for milking. There is a need for technology to reduce the burden of a range of manual tasks in current milking practices including cup attachment, cup removal, health and milk quality monitoring, teat disinfection, animal identification and drafting. Many farms do not utilize existing technology which allows most of the in-parlor tasks (except cup attachment) to be automated. The need for automating the cup attachmen...|$|E

Animals were in lactations 1 - 8, were 6 - 19 {{years old and}} were 4 - 15 months of their current lactation. Milk flow curves were recorded using an electronic milk flow meter (Lactocorder®). Milk flow curves were classified in three typical patterns: type 1 represents curves with one high and short peak of milk flow; type 2 represents curves with a moderate mean milk flow rate during a large plateau phase; and type 3 represents curves with lower mean milk flow rate and a relatively longer milking duration. The ratio of the different milk flow patterns in the population evaluated was 40 : 38 : 22 % for types 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The highest milk yield per milking, average and peak milk flow were observed in camels with type 1 curves (4 · 24 kg, 1 · 49 and 3 · 54 kg/min, respectively) followed by type 2 animals (3 · 30 kg, 1 · 12 and 2 · 12 kg/min, respectively) and lastly type 3 curves (2 · 34 kg, 0 · 65 and 1 · 23 kg/min, respectively).

40|$|The goat {{sector has}} an {{important}} position in Greek agriculture contributing 15 % to the total out-put of country’s animal production. The total goat population in Greece currently numbers around 5. 3 million animals (Faostat, 2003). A major part of this number (above 70 %) consists of the local goat breed – Capra Prisca type, ~ 0. 1 % are purebred goats of imported dairy breeds (Saanen, Alpine, Damascus) and a considerable portion (above 25 %) is crosses between imported breeds and local Greek breed (Zygoyiannis and Katsaounis, 1992). The traditional technique of milking (hand milk-ing) that is applied on the majority of goat farms {{of the country is}} a strongly limiting factor as re-gards the labour efficiency and the living standard of farmers (Sinapis and Thessalos, 1999). On the other hand, there is a negative impact on the quality of produced milk (higher somatic cells and bacte-rial colonies) and as a consequence on its prod-ucts. Machine milking offers a good solution in this respect. Machine milkability is an important factor that influences the <b>milking</b> <b>efficiency</b> of a dairy breed and consequently the living standard of farmers. It is generally accepted that goats have a good milk-ability but some of them are harder to be milked having a higher proportion of machine stripped milk and residual milk.

40|$|This {{case study}} {{documents}} {{the trajectory of}} a successful alternative dairy farm in southeastern Wisconsin. The 1990 s were a difficult period for dairying and the Krusenbaum family entered this shifting field in 1990 with a 37 -cow Holstein herd in a stanchion barn, 88 tillable hectares and a vision to gradually develop a biodynamic dairy. Low milk prices and the unrelenting workload associated with conventional dairying forced the family to look for alternative strategies. By 1995 they had converted all their land to 47 rotationally grazed paddocks, increased herd size to 70 cows and their annual net farm income had grown to a solid $ 54, 000. The workload remained very heavy, and {{during the next few}} years they introduced a swing- 16 milking parlor that approximately doubled their <b>milking</b> <b>efficiency</b> and allowed them to again increase herd size, implemented seasonal dairying and constructed an outwintering shed (1997) that greatly facilitated animal management during the winter. By 2002 the farming system had been, by and large, consolidated and by not focusing solely on milk production and crossbreeding with non-Holstein breeds, the herd benefited from improved reproductive vigor. They were then able to synchronize annual calving and the herd’s maximum nutritional needs with the spring flush of their pastures, which resulted in lowered purchased feed costs per cow. By this time, annual milk production was fairly constant [around 7400 kg rolling herd average (RHA) ], herd health was good and annual net farm income had grown to $ 75, 600. In 2003, the farm became certified organic. With this change the value of the milk increased dramatically from $ 0. 31 liter- 1 t...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports a}} {{quantitative}} genetics and genomic analysis of undesired presence of supernumerary teats (SNT) in goats. Supernumerary teats {{are a problem}} in goat breeding as they can considerably impede machine <b>milking</b> <b>efficiency,</b> leading to increased milking time and injury. This phenotype has routinely been recorded for the past 15 yr in French Alpine and Saanen goats. Around 4 % of the females had been assigned the SNT phenotype and consequently could not {{be included in the}} breeding program as elite animals. The heritability of this binary trait, estimated by applying linear logistic polygenic models to 32, 908 Alpine and 23, 217 Saanen females, was 0. 40 and 0. 44, respectively. A genome-wide association study was implemented using a daughter design composed of 810 Saanen goats sired by 9 artificial insemination bucks and 1, 185 Alpine goats sired by 11 bucks, genotyped with the goatSNP 50 chip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). This association study was based on logistic polygenic models, one with separately taken single nucleotide polymorphisms and the other with haplotypes as fixed effects. The 2 breeds were analyzed together and separately. No region was found to be significant at the genome level, but 17 regions on 10 chromosomes were significant at the chromosome level. These signals were always only slightly above the chromosome significance threshold and only a few of them overlapped across analyses. No evidence of segregation of a major gene in our Saanen and Alpine populations was observed, suggesting that SNT presence is inherited in a polygenic fashion. This conclusion regarding SNT determinism agrees with recent association analyses in cattle, and one locus was even found in an orthologous region. The possibility of applying markers-based selection on the SNT trait is therefore unlikely, but, as this trait is heritable and routinely recorded, it could be managed by attributing a dedicated estimated breeding value...|$|E

The examinations {{were made in the}} agricultural company ZDV Krchleby, a. s. during the year of 2007 to 2009. In total, 147 dairy cows were used for observation including 35 Holstein dairy cows (100 % H, R 100 %), in a group called - H 1, 70 Holstein cows crossed with Czech spotted cattle (H 75 - 87 %, R 75 - 87 %) in group - H 3 and 42 Holstein cows crossed with Czech spotted cattle (H 50 - 74 %, R 50 - 74 %), in group - H 4. Furthermore, the basic data set was divided according to lactation into four groups: 1 st lactation, 2 nd lactations, 3 rd lactations, 4 th and more lactations. The main indicators for evaluation of the <b>milk</b> <b>efficiency</b> were the: <b>milk</b> quantity (kg), amount of fat in the milk (%), production of the fat in the milk (kg), amount of protein in the milk (%), production of protein in the milk (kg), content of lactose in the milk (%), persistency of lactation and lactation duration (in days). In terms of fertility, the following factors were evaluated: the cow?s age at first birth (in days), insemination interval (in days), service period (in days) and the periods between births (in days). The cows in the first group milked on average of 8945. 03 kg of milk, the amount of fat was 3. 66 %, the content of protein was 3. 32 %.

40|$|The high-production {{dairy cows}} have {{problems}} with fertility, because there is negative correlation between fertility and milk production. Very often the problem with fertility is connected with cumulative number of quiet, indistinctive ruts. Such a problem causes prolongation of service period, increases consumption of insemination doses and rises the number of veterinary acts. Therefore new possibilities are searched to ensure satisfying fertility of cows. The objective of this work was to evaluate different procedures for insemination of cows of Holstein cattle. The research proceeded at agricultural company Kosova Hora, which has two stables with dairy cows. The controlled reproduction by means of hormones is used at cow-shed in Janov, whereas the natural reproduction when a cattleman looks for rutting cows is used at cow-shed in Kamenice. The way of stockbreeding, stabling and feeding was very similar in both cow-sheds. There were 203 dairy cows of Holstein cattle (H 100 %) or crossbreed dairy cows of Czech spotted cattle (H 75 and more) included in survey. Reproductive indices (such as insemination interval, service period, meantime {{and the age of}} a cow when first calves) and also indices of <b>milk</b> <b>efficiency</b> in 1 kg of milk (for 100, 200 and 305 days of lactation) were monitored. The period of insemination interval was about 16, 81 days shorter in the cow-shed where hormones (84, 36; 101, 17 days) were applied with confirmation statistically highly significant difference at the level of significance P < 0, 001. There was no statistically significant difference when the duration of service period was measured. The duration of service period was on the same level in both cow-sheds (162, 12; 162, 84 days). When the outcomes of both cow-sheds were summarized the difference in the duration of meantime was found. With usage of synchronization the difference was 19, 20 days, but without statistical demonstrativeness (P < 0, 05) at the level 410, 28; 429, 48 days. When indices of <b>milk</b> <b>efficiency</b> were measured there were not found statistically significant differences as for the whole lactation (9 926, 19; 9 749, 48 kg of milk) and also for individual sections of lactation (100 days about 30, 96 kg of milk more at the cow-shed without synchronization; 200 days about 78, 44 kg of milk more at the cow-shed with synchronization) ...|$|R
