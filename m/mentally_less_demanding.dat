40|$|Cortical {{stimulation}} mapping is {{a valuable}} tool to test the functional organization of the motor cortex in both basic neurophysiology (e. g., elucidating the process of motor plasticity) and clinical practice (e. g., before resecting brain tumors involving the motor cortex). However, compilation of motor maps based on the motor threshold (MT) requires {{a large number of}} cortical stimulations and is therefore time consuming. Shortening the time for mapping may reduce stress on the subjects and unveil short-term plasticity mechanisms. In this study, we aimed to establish a cortical stimulation mapping procedure in which the time needed to identify a motor area is reduced to the order of minutes without compromising reliability. We developed an automatic motor mapping system that applies epidural cortical surface stimulations (CSSs) through one-by-one of 32 micro-electrocorticographic electrodes while examining the muscles represented in a cortical region. The next stimulus intensity was selected according to previously evoked electromyographic responses in a closed-loop fashion. CSS was repeated at 4 Hz and electromyographic responses were submitted to a newly proposed algorithm estimating the MT with smaller number of stimuli with respect to traditional approaches. The results showed that in all tested rats (n = 12) the motor area maps identified by our novel mapping procedure (novel MT algorithm and 4 -Hz CSS) significantly correlated with the maps achieved by the conventional MT algorithm with 1 -Hz CSS. The reliability of the both mapping methods was very high (intraclass correlation coefficients ≧ 0. 8), while the time needed for the mapping was one-twelfth shorter with the novel method. Furthermore, the motor maps assessed by intracortical microstimulation and the novel CSS mapping procedure in two rats were compared and were also significantly correlated. Our novel mapping procedure that determined a cortical motor area within a few minutes could help to study the functional significance of short-term plasticity in motor learning and recovery from brain injuries. Besides this advantage, particularly in the case of human patients or experimental animals that are less trained to remain at rest, shorter mapping time is physically and <b>mentally</b> <b>less</b> <b>demanding</b> and might allow the evaluation of motor maps in awake individuals as well...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study {{reported}} in this paper was to compare three different types of interfaces providing: haptic information, graphic information, or combined haptic and graphic information in an easy menu selection task. The results suggested that the combined haptic and graphic interface was preferable to the graphic interface regarding accuracy, while both interfaces were fundamentally equal concerning completion time. The results also indicated that the combined haptic and graphic interface was <b>less</b> <b>mentally</b> <b>demanding</b> than either the graphic or the haptic interface. Solely haptic feedback obtained, without exception, worse results than the other cases. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} diploma thesis offers {{possibilities and}} limits of using the Golden Profiler of Personality (GPOP) {{in the context of}} personnel psychology. Attention is devoted to general methodological principles of psychological assessments, their contribution to personnel practice focusing on recruitment process and the discussion about increasing efficiency of selection process <b>less</b> <b>mentally</b> <b>demanding</b> and responsible positions. The theoretical part is mainly dedicated to the method GPOP, which in its core is based on the Jung's theory of psychological types, which has stimulated development of the questionnaire MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator), and the Five-factor personality theory. Combining two completely different approaches it comes into being an assessment able to interpret on the one side, the uniqueness of personality, and on the second side its resemblance to a certain type. In the practical part, the psychometric characteristics of the questionnaire completed by 524 selected respondents are analyzed and evaluated. Reliability of the global scales is estimated of Cronbach`s alpha interval 0. 8 to 0. 9. Correlation analysis and exploratory factor analysis clearly support the expected construct of GPOP. The norms are compiled for a specific population, and the presented notifications attend on [...] ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{study the}} {{applicability}} of a visual P 3 -based and a Steady State Visually Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) -based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) for mental text spelling on a cohort of patients with incomplete Locked-In Syndrome (LIS). METHODS: Seven patients performed repeated sessions with each BCI. We assessed BCI performance, mental workload and overall satisfaction for both systems. We also investigated {{the effect of the}} quality of life and level of motor impairment on the performance. RESULTS: All seven patients were able to achieve an accuracy of 70 % or more with the SSVEP-based BCI, compared to 3 patients with the P 3 -based BCI, showing a better performance with the SSVEP BCI than with the P 3 BCI in the studied cohort. Moreover, the better performance of the SSVEP-based BCI was accompanied by a lower mental workload and a higher overall satisfaction. No relationship was found between BCI performance and level of motor impairment or quality of life. CONCLUSION: Our results show a better usability of the SSVEP-based BCI than the P 3 -based one for the sessions performed by the tested population of locked-in patients with respect to all the criteria considered. The study shows the advantage of developing alternative BCIs with respect to the traditional matrix-based P 3 speller using different designs and signal modalities such as SSVEPs to build a faster, more accurate, <b>less</b> <b>mentally</b> <b>demanding</b> and more satisfying BCI by testing both types of BCIs on a convenience sample of LIS patients...|$|R
