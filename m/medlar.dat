25|$|The {{publicity}} surrounding automobile journey {{brought her}} to the attention of Jerome Fanciulli and Glenn Curtiss who agreed to provide her with flying lessons in Hammondsport, New York. She was the only woman to receive instruction directly from Curtiss. He fitted a limiter on the throttle of Scott's airplane to prevent it gaining enough speed to become airborne while she practiced taxiing on her own. On September 6 either the limiter moved or a gust of wind lifted the biplane and she flew to an altitude of forty feet before executing a gentle landing. Her flight was short and possibly unintentional but Scott is credited by the Early Birds of Aviation as the first woman to pilot and solo in an airplane in the United States, although Bessica <b>Medlar</b> Raiche's flight on September 16 was accredited as first by the Aeronautical Society of America at the time.|$|E
25|$|Inland {{from the}} coast {{there is a great}} deal of housing development: some of this has little infrastructure, while most is more expensive, {{especially}} in areas such as Kozyatağı and İçerenköy. These districts house many of İstanbul's upper-middle class residents. These neighbourhoods are mainly built around wide avenues and tree-lined streets, with four to six-storey apartment buildings that have sizable gardens and car-parking around them. Especially in Kozyatağı, there are old Ottoman houses nearly in every houses' garden (Each house or apartment has a big garden with parking lots and arbours while these gardens used to be the old house's). Kozyatağı, Suadiye and Kazasker used to be one of the most popular summer areas for wealthy İstanbul residents. Today, Kozyatağı has tree-lined streets, especially magnolia, linden and fruit trees such as <b>medlar</b> trees, plum trees, cherry, mulberry and quince trees, lots of large greenfields, parks, children parks. These areas, Suadiye, Bağdat Caddesi, Kalamış, Kozyatağı, Fenerbahçe have today, upper-middle or upper class residents. There are many schools, hospitals, shops and restaurants in these areas. There is also a large Carrefour and Bauhaus store on the E5 highway in this part of Kadıköy.|$|E

5000|$|Ripe <b>medlars,</b> for example, {{are taken}} from the tree, placed somewhere cool, and allowed to ripen for several weeks. In Trees and Shrubs, {{horticulturist}} F. A.

More often the fruit is used for making jelly." [...] Ideally, the fruit should be harvested from the tree immediately following a hard frost, which starts the bletting process by breaking down cell walls and speeding softening.|$|R

2500|$|In March 1995, US Attorney General Janet Reno {{bowed to}} {{demands of the}} new Republican {{majority}} in the House of Representatives and secured the appointment of an Independent Counsel, David Barrett to investigate allegations that Cisneros had lied to FBI investigators during background checks prior to being named Secretary of HUD. He had been asked about payments {{that he had made}} to former mistress Linda <b>Medlar,</b> also known as Linda Jones. Both were married at the time when <b>Medlar</b> volunteered to work on Cisneros' campaign for Mayor of San Antonio. The affair had been 'public knowledge' {{for a number of years}} until <b>Medlar</b> sold the story to Inside Edition for $15,000. [...] The investigation was based on Cisneros's understating to the FBI the amount of money paid to his former mistress and was continued for 10 years, until in January 1996, when Congress finally refused to continue funding it.|$|E

2500|$|This {{plant has}} oval entire leaves, and {{unisexual}} flowers on short stalks. In the male flowers, which are numerous, the stamens are sixteen {{in number and}} arranged in pairs; the female flowers are solitary, with traces of stamens, and a smooth ovary with one ovule {{in each of the}} eight cells—the ovary is surmounted by four styles, which are hairy at the base. The fruit-stalk is very short, bearing a subglobose fruit an inch in diameter or a bit larger, of an orange-yellow color, ranging to bluish, and with a sweetish astringent pulp. [...] It is surrounded at the base by the persistent calyx-lobes, which increase in size as the fruit ripens. [...] The astringency renders the fruit somewhat unpalatable, but after it has been subjected to the action of frost, or has become partially rotted or [...] "bletted" [...] like a <b>medlar,</b> its flavor is improved.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Medlar</b> had {{surfaced}} in 1994 with {{a breach of}} contract lawsuit against Cisneros, claiming he had agreed to support her until her daughter’s college graduation, {{but that he had}} discontinued monthly payments. Cisneros had made payments to her following the end of their affair, discontinuing them only after taking a pay cut upon returning to public life. [...] Although Cisneros had divulged the payments during the FBI background check preceding his appointment, Medlar’s claims suggested that Cisneros might have misrepresented the amount. That led to Attorney General Janet Reno recommending a special prosecutor be appointed to investigate Cisneros in March 1995. In December 1997, Cisneros was indicted on 18 counts of conspiracy, giving false statements and obstruction of justice. In September 1999, Cisneros negotiated a plea agreement, under which he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of lying to the FBI and was fined $10,000. He did not receive jail time or probation.|$|E
