5000|$|A {{surface plate}} is a solid, flat plate {{used as the}} main {{horizontal}} reference plane for precision inspection, marking out (layout), and tooling setup. The surface plate is often used as the baseline for all measurements to a workpiece, therefore one primary surface is finished extremely flat with accuracy up to 0.00001 in for a grade AA or AAA plate. Surface plates are a very common tool in the manufacturing industry and are often permanently attached to robotic-type inspection devices such as a coordinate-measuring <b>machine.</b> <b>Plates</b> are typically square or rectangular.

40|$|Background: In spastic {{cerebral}} palsy (SCP), a {{limited range of}} motion of the foot (ROM), limits gait and other activities. Assessment of this limitation of ROM and knowledge of active mechanisms is of crucial importance for clinical treatment. Methods. For a comparison between spastic {{cerebral palsy}} (SCP) children and typically developing children (TD), medial gastrocnemius muscle-tendon complex length was assessed using 3 -D ultrasound imaging techniques, while exerting externally standardized moments via a hand-held dynamometer. Exemplary X-ray imaging of ankle and foot was used to confirm possible TD-SCP differences in foot deformation. Results: SCP and TD {{did not differ in}} normalized level of excitation (EMG) of muscles studied. For given moments exerted in SCP, <b>foot</b> <b>plate</b> angles were all more towards plantar flexion than in TD. However, <b>foot</b> <b>plate</b> angle proved to be an invalid estimator of talocrural joint angle, since at equal <b>foot</b> <b>plate</b> angles, GM muscle-tendon complex was shorter in SCP (corresponding to an equivalent of 1 cm). A substantial difference remained even after normalizing for individual differences in tibia length. X-ray imaging of ankle and foot of one SCP child and two typically developed adults, confirmed that in SCP that of total footplate angle changes (0 - 4 Nm: 15 °), the contribution of foot deformation to changes in <b>foot</b> <b>plate</b> angle (8) were as big as the contribution of dorsal flexion at the talocrural joint (7 °). In typically developed individuals there were relatively smaller contributions (10 - 11 %) by foot deformation to changes in <b>foot</b> <b>plate</b> angle, indicating that the contribution of talocrural angle changes was most important. Using a new estimate for position at the talocrural joint (the difference between GM muscle-tendon complex length and tibia length, GM relative length) removed this effect, thus allowing more fair comparison of SCP and TD data. On the basis of analysis of <b>foot</b> <b>plate</b> angle and GM relative length as a function of externally applied moments, it is concluded that <b>foot</b> <b>plate</b> angle measurements underestimate angular changes at the talocrural joint when moving in dorsal flexion direction and overestimate them when moving in plantar flexion direction, with concomitant effects on triceps surae lengths. Conclusions: In SCP children diagnosed with decreased dorsal ROM of the ankle joint, the commonly used measure (i. e. range of <b>foot</b> <b>plate</b> angle), is not a good estimate of rotation at the talocrural joint. since a sizable part of the movement of the <b>foot</b> (or <b>foot</b> <b>plate)</b> derives from internal deformation of the foot. © 2013 Huijing et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R

Although significant technological advancements {{have been made in}} the last decade, the literature survey showed that the state-of-the-art force measurements are often limited to individuals in artificial laboratory environments.
