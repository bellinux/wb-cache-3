6000|$|Miss Harriet, sat old Madison Chalkley, {{the biggest}} and most venerable citizen of the neighborhood. Mr Chalkley never, by any chance, got a letter, the only mail matter he {{received}} being, [...] "The Southern Baptist Recorder," [...] which came on Saturdays, but, like most of the people present, he was at the post-office every <b>mail</b> <b>day</b> to see who got anything. Next to him sat Colonel Iston, a tall, lean, quiet old gentleman, who had, for a long series of years, occupied the position of a last apple on a tree. He had no relatives, no friends with whom he corresponded, no business that was not conducted by word of mouth. In the last fifteen years he had received but one letter, and that had so surprised him that he carried it about with him three days before he opened it, and then he found that it was really intended for a gentleman of the same name in another county. And yet everybody knew that if Colonel Iston failed to appear in his place on <b>mail</b> <b>day,</b> it would be because he was dead or prostrated by sickness.|$|E
60|$|It was <b>mail</b> <b>day</b> at {{the very}} small village known as Howlett's, and to the fence {{in front of the}} post-office were {{attached}} three mules and a horse. Inside the yard, tied to the low bough of a tree, was a very lean and melancholy horse, on which had lately arrived Wesley Green, the negro man who, twice a week, brought the mail from Pocohontas, a railway station, twenty miles away. There was a station not six miles from Howlett's, but, for some reason, the mail bag was always brought from and carried to Pocohontas; Wesley Green requiring a whole day for a deliberate transit between the two points.|$|E

My difficulty was great; I had no man here who was fit, or who would have cared to write for me; and I had to postpone the visit. So I gave up half-a-day with a groan, {{went down to the}} priests, arranged for Monday week to go to Malie, and named Thursday as my day to lunch with Laupepa. I was sharply ill on Wednesday, <b>mail</b> <b>day.</b> But on Thursday I had to trail down and go through the dreary business of a feast, in the King's wretched shanty, full in view of the President's fine new house; it made my heart burn.|$|E

The worst of my news is the influenza; Apia is devastate; the shops closed, a ball put off, etc. As yet we have not had it at Vailima, and, who knows? we may escape.

60|$|Once {{properly}} disposed {{she presented}} a figure which elicited the lively admiration of her friends, whose number was now increased {{by the arrival}} of a couple of negro boys on mules, who were going to the post-office, it being Saturday, and <b>mail</b> <b>day.</b> Around Aunt Patsy's shoulders was a bright blue worsted shawl, and upon her head a voluminous turban of vivid red and yellow. Since their emancipation, the negroes {{in that part of the}} country had discarded the positive and gaudy colors that were their delight when they were slaves, and had transferred their fancy to delicate pinks, pale blues, and similar shades. But Aunt Patsy's ideas about dress were those of by-gone days, and she was too old now to change them, and her brightest handkerchief had been selected for her head on this important day. Above her she held a parasol, which had been graciously loaned by her descendant of the fourth generation. It was white, and lined with pink, and on the edges still lingered some fragments of cotton lace.|$|E

The Adelaide Steamship Company had a wharf on the town reach of the Johnstone River.

Ships of the Mosquito Fleet also carried mail to the Johnstone River Post Office, which began operation on 1 November 1882. <b>Mail</b> <b>day</b> was an important event and everyone tried to be on hand to meet the boat and collect their mail.

[...] Telegram [...] Smith reported in his autobiography, during one run from Omaha to Cheyenne, that he had had to ditch into a pasture, landing on a cow. He sent a laconic telegram to his division supervisor at headquarters in College Park, Maryland, reporting the mishap. Crashes were part of the job. Engines were unreliable, and pilots were using road maps. Unpredictable, bad weather was a constant risk. In {{the first five years of}} US Post Office air mail service the average forced landing was every 800 miles and a pilot was killed about every 80,000 miles. Thirty-five pilots died during the Postal Service's operation of air mail flights; most deaths were between 1920 and 1925.|$|E

As the oxen, skilfully guided by Uncle Isham's long prod, turned into the yard, everybody came forward to find out the reason of this unlooked-for occurrence.
