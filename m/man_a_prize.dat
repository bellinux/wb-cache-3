5000|$|Sperm Wars is a {{primarily}} nonfiction book by evolutionary biologist Robin Baker. Originally {{published in}} English in 1996, {{it has since}} appeared in 25 languages and in 2006 a 10th anniversary edition {{was published in the}} United States. Through a series of short fictional stories and discussion following them, Baker proposes evolutionary functions for sexual habits, mostly on the principle of competition between sperm of different <b>men</b> for <b>a</b> <b>prized</b> egg. [...] The [...] "sperm wars" [...] include both literal battles between sperm inside a woman's reproductive tract, as well as figurative battles between men competing for the chance to mate. The book is controversial, both because of its explanations of homosexuality, sexual assault, and prostitution, and because some critics have claimed that several of the hypotheses in the book are not supported by scientific research.|$|R

The image depicted a soldier, who appears to be a child, dead and lying on the side of the road, with a group of civilians looking down at the body. It was published on May 5, 1968.|$|R
