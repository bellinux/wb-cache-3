5|$|Rajab {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of the first <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> {{protection}} committee in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, the <b>Migrant</b> <b>Workers</b> Protection Group (in 2003). On 28 April 2007, the Bahraini Parliament passed a law banning unmarried <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> from living in residential areas. BCHR issued a press release condemning this decision as discriminatory and promoting negative racist attitudes towards <b>migrant</b> <b>workers.</b> Rajab, then BCHR vice president, said: It is appalling that Bahrain is willing to rest on the benefits of these people’s hard work, and often their suffering, but that they refuse to live with them in equality and dignity. The solution is not to force <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> into ghettos, but to urge companies to improve living conditions for workers – and not to accommodate large numbers of workers in inadequate space, and to improve the standard of living for them.|$|E
5|$|Although the Hong Kong {{government}} has enacted legislation which nominally protects <b>migrant</b> <b>workers,</b> recourse is time-consuming {{and the costs}} considerable.

5|$|Many <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> {{have little}} education, little {{knowledge}} {{of the law and}} their rights, and leave home to support their families. They fall victim to agents (official and unofficial), unscrupulous officials and a lack of legal protection at home and in their host countries.

5|$|In Johannesburg in the 1950s, {{crime was}} a day-to-day reality, and Sophiatown was {{the nucleus of}} all reef crimes. Gangsters were city-bred and spoke a mixture of Afrikaans and English, known as tsotsitaal. Some of the more {{well-known}} gangs in Sophiatown were the Russians, the Americans, the Gestapo, the Berliners and the Vultures. The names the Gestapo and the Berliners reflect their admiration for Hitler, whom they saw {{as some kind of}} hero, for taking on the whites of Europe. The best known gang from this period, and also best studied, was the Russians. They were a group of Basotho <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> who banded together {{in the absence of any}} effective law enforcement by either mine owners or the state. The primary goal of this gang was to protect members from the tsotsis and from other gangs of <b>migrant</b> <b>workers,</b> and to acquire and defend resources they found desirable - most notably women, jobs and the urban space necessary for the parties and staged fights that formed the bulk of their weekend entertainment.|$|E

5|$|Malaysia's {{unprecedented}} {{and recent}} rapid development has attracted millions of <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> from across Asia {{in the recent}} years. The majority of whom are undocumented, which the Malaysian government is struggling to combat. Its treatment and crackdown on <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> has often been criticised by international human rights watchdogs. Today, Malaysia has a newly industrialised market economy, ranked 4th largest in Southeast Asia and 38th largest in the world. With a GDP per capita of $9,766 and an HDI of 0.78 currently, Malaysia is classified as an emerging economy by the World Bank. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) also classifies Malaysia as an emerging and developing country. It is {{a founding member of}} the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the East Asia Summit, and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. Malaysia is also a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Commonwealth of Nations, and the Non-Aligned Movement.

5|$|A recent phenomenon, the {{migration}} of rural Chinese workers began in 1984 when the Regulations of Permanent Residence Registration became less punitive and allowed people to move to find employment. People left rural areas to escape poverty, and females left {{due to the lack}} of local opportunities for women. In the cities, women could find new, low-paid factory-based jobs that did not require highly skilled workers. According to national statistics, the ratio of male to female <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> averages 2:1, and an estimated 30-40 million of the migrant women work in the cities, namely Hong Kong and Shenzhen.|$|E
5|$|Organizations are now {{attempting}} to assist and empower female <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> through {{training and education}} on their labor-related rights. Legal clinics have begun to assist female migrants in filing claims against employers and local labor bureaus. One case of female worker exploitation in the Hua Yi garment factory in Beijing resulted in mistreatment by management as well as withholding pay for at least 24 women. After filing complaints, {{in collaboration with the}} Center for Women's Law Studies and Legal Services of Beijing University, the women received 170,000 Yuan in back wages and compensation.|$|E
40|$|Based on ethnographic {{fieldwork}} among <b>migrant</b> <b>worker</b> NGOs conducted between 2011 and 2015, {{this article}} employs critical theories of citizenship {{to illustrate how}} <b>migrant</b> <b>worker</b> NGOs use a strategy of ‘resistance through accommodation’ to re-shape the citizenship regime and discourse in China. The dominant literature on labour activism tends to discount the potential for <b>migrant</b> <b>worker</b> NGOs to undertake resistance, on account of their dependency upon {{the state and the}} market. The article contends that while NGOs must engage in relations with the state to ensure their own survival, their activism does not ultimately centre on either resisting or accommodating to the state directly, but rather upon a broader engagement process aimed at the strategic purpose of ‘citizenship transformation’...|$|R
