40|$|A tension {{infiltrometer}} {{for field}} use, where both water level changes measurement and tension settings could be automated, was built in-house. Differential pressure transducers {{were used to}} automate the water level measurement in the reservoir. The <b>Mariotte</b> <b>bottle</b> was automated {{by a set of}} solenoid valves which were connected via tubing to pre-defined depths in the <b>Mariotte</b> <b>bottle.</b> Based on design parameters tested in the laboratory (sensor sensitivity, water reservoir diameter, and bubbling rate) three identical tension infiltrometers connected to a single <b>Mariotte</b> <b>bottle</b> were built. A new reservoir system made of two plexiglass tubes of different diameter slotted in each other was found to reduce the measurement fluctuations caused by the disturbance created to rising bubbles in the reservoir. The new system was tested on a uniform sandy loam profile prepared in the soil bin laboratory and different analytical and numerical data analysis methods were compared. The measured steady state data were used to determine K(h) at different suctions using the analytical method proposed by Reynolds and Elrick (1991). The K(h) points obtained were fitted with the van Genuchten’s equation (van Genuchten, 1980) using the RETC program to calculate the best fit parameters Ks,  and n. These parameters were used as initial estimates of the soil hydraulic parameters in the numerical models HYDRUS 1 D and 2 D, in which transient cumulative flow data was used to determine the soil hydraulic functions via inverse modelling. The analysis of variance determined significantly higher K(h) values calculated by HYDRUS 1 D while the other methods did not differ from each other. Finally, the tension infiltrometer was used in the field on a sandy loam soil to characterise five different tillage treatments (conventional plough, shallow plough, minimum tillage, direct drill, and no-tillage). The effect of wheel traffic was also evaluated by measuring the infiltration rates in the wheel-marks. The fully automated system allowed the measurement of infiltration rates for 8 tensions in triplicate per day with hardly any human intervention apart for refilling the reservoir. The results show that the tillage practices and wheel-traffic have a significant influence on the soil hydraulic function K(h) ...|$|E

40|$|A simple, {{inexpensive}} {{nutrient solution}} circulation system was developed {{which could be}} duplicated in developing countries. The airlift perfusion principle was employed to continuously recirculate nutrient solution within individual pots containing porous medium. The system {{has proven to be}} very satisfactory for N studies including a 15 N experiment and an evaluation of the transfer of legume-fixed N to a grass growing in a sep-arate pot. Additional index words. Perfusion system, N transfer. A system for supplying nutrient solutions to pot-grown plants should a) provide the solution at a constant rate; b) maintain homogeneity of the solu-tion, or constant concentration of nutrients, or both; c) maintain the integrity of different nutrient treat-ments; and d) allow adequate aeration in the root zone. Several systems have been devised to accomplish these goals. <b>Mariotte's</b> <b>Bottle</b> (and subsequent modifications) provide for continuously regulating the level of solution in pots or as a constant-head device for continuously-flowing nutrient solutions (3). <b>Mariotte's</b> <b>bottle</b> or more elaborate continuously-flowing nutrient culture solution systems (3) can maintain nutrient concentrations within relatively close tolerances but require large quantities of solution. Compressed air (2, 3) or solution-pump methods (3, 4) (whereby nu-trient solution is forced upward into the pots at regu-lar intervals and then allowed to drain back to the reservoir) may require less volume of solution, but usually require sophisticated control equipment for operation. The NifTAL 3 project required a simple inexpensive system which could be easily duplicated in developing countries yet provide sufficient reliability and uni-formity for 15 N and other nutrient-response studies. We found that the perfusion system utilized for studies of microbiological activity in soil (1) could be readily adapted to meet these requirements...|$|R
50|$|The single ring {{involves}} {{driving a}} ring {{into the soil}} and supplying water in the ring either at constant head or falling head condition. Constant head refers to condition where {{the amount of water}} in the ring is always held constant. Because infiltration capacity is the maximum infiltration rate, and if infiltration rate exceeds the infiltration capacity, runoff will be the consequence, therefore maintaining constant head means the rate of water supplied corresponds to the infiltration capacity. The supplying of water is done with a <b>Mariotte's</b> <b>bottle.</b> Falling head refers to condition where water is supplied in the ring, and the water is allowed to drop with time. The operator records how much water goes into the soil for a given time period. The rate of which water goes into the soil is related to the soil's hydraulic conductivity.|$|R

Several types of flow-rators described in literature were examined but found unsatisfactory for the purpose. A description of a simplified and fairly accurate all-glass flow-rator of the variable area type, designed by the authors, is given in this paper. The method of calibration of the flow-rator under varying temperature conditions is given. The accuracy of the flow·rator has been verified by actual test-run results and by making {{a comparison of the}} material balance. The results indicate an accuracy within 5 %. INTRODUC 1 ION A large variety of laboratory flow-meters designed to operate on different principles are described in literature. Although meters working on thermo-electric and electronic drop counting principles seem to be interesting, the <b>Mariotte</b> <b>bottle</b> type is found to be suitable for laboratory purposes. Zentner! employed an apparatus in which the liquid is siphoned from a <b>Mariotte</b> <b>bottle</b> and delivered through a capillary. An improved form of the above flow-meter has been described by Fabris and Peacock " in which, the liquid is used to measure the pressure differential across the capillary. Many difficulties, however, were encountered by us in testing the <b>Mariotte</b> <b>bottle</b> type, constructed in our laboratories. It was found that considerable time elapsed before the liquid attained definite differential height in the two limbs for a correct reading of a steady flow-rate to be taken. Further, it was difficult to set up the complicated all-glass construction in three dimensions on a wooden frame, and several parts were broken ar. d had to be frequently repaired, necessitating its recalibration every time. The final design of the flow-meter constructed by us was much simplified {{as a result of a}} numher of unsuccessful attempts to modify the older types. This is one of variable area type in which the liquid can be made to flow at varying rates by changing the amount of opening of a stop-cock.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the project was}} the investigation of the percolate rate and the disposition of nitrogen from a laboratory soil column when chlorinated secondary sewage effluent was applied under both continuous and intermittent loading. A 1. 7 -m (5. 5 -in.) diameter column was packed to a depth of 1. 5 m (5 ft) with a well-aggregated Oxisol soil (Lahaina series). A constant head was maintained by a modified <b>Mariotte</b> <b>bottle</b> during the application of effluent. Percolate was sampled through ports at 7 depths as well as from a bottom drain. When effluent was continuously ponded on the surface: (1) percolate rate decreased with time, (2) ammonium ions were adsorbed, (3) nitrification was suppressed, (4) denitrification occurred, and (5) the denitrification biological community required more than 2 days to develop. When effluent application was stopped after 2 days and aerobic conditions developed, nitrification was very active within 5 days.

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{research}} studied threshold electrolyte concentration (TEC) {{of irrigation}} water {{and its effect}} on the infiltration rate of two contrasting soils from Pernambuco state, Brazil. The experiment was conducted in the Soil Chemistry and Salinity Laboratory of Federal Rural University of Pernambuco. Each soil was packed in five Buchner funnels, where one funnel from each soil was submitted to treatment with solution of electrical conductivity (EC) of 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0, 4. 0 or 8. 0 dS m- 1. For each funnel containing soil, an increasing ratio of NaCl to CaCl 2 was applied in a treatment solution to achieve 10 increasing values of sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) from 0 to 100. These solutions were applied through a <b>Mariotte</b> <b>bottle,</b> with a constant hydraulic head of ~ 2 cm (pressure potential). After a liter of solution had drained, in the flux was collected for a known time interval, until steady state was reached. Darcy’s equation was used to calculate saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) and a mathematical model used to calculate the TEC as a 20 % reduction in Ksat. By increasing SAR similar behavior was noted between the two soils, whereby Ksat decreased, although the relativedecrease in Ksat was greater for SAR of 100 in the soil with higher clay content...|$|E
40|$|Determination of the {{accuracy}} of commonly used techniques for measuring sap flux density in trees often presents a challenge. We therefore designed and built a verification system for heat-based sap flow sensors typically used at stem level. In the laboratory, a <b>Mariotte's</b> <b>bottle</b> device was used to maintain a constant {{flow rate of water}} through freshly cut stem segments of American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.). This verification system was used to determine {{the accuracy}} of three heat-based sap flux density techniques: heat pulse velocity, thermal dissipation and heat field deformation. All three techniques substantially underestimated sap flux density when compared against gravimetric measurements. On average the actual sap flux density was underestimated by 35 % using heat pulse velocity, 46 % using heat field deformation and 60 % using thermal dissipation. These differences were consistent across sap flux densities ranging from 5 to 80 cm(3) cm(- 2) h(- 1). Field measurements supported the relative sensor performance observed in the laboratory. Applying a sensor-specific correction factor based on the laboratory test to the field data produced similar estimates of sap flux density from all three techniques. We concluded that a species-specific calibration is therefore necessary when using any of these techniques to insure that accurate estimates of sap flux density are obtained, at least until a physical basis for error correction can be proposed...|$|R
50|$|In static {{solution}} culture, {{plants are}} grown in containers of nutrient solution, such as glass Mason jars (typically, in-home applications), plastic buckets, tubs, or tanks. The solution is usually gently aerated {{but may be}} un-aerated. If un-aerated, the solution level is kept low enough that enough roots are above the solution so they get adequate oxygen. A hole is cut in {{the lid of the}} reservoir for each plant. There can be one to many plants per reservoir. Reservoir size can be increased as plant size increases. A home made system can be constructed from plastic food containers or glass canning jars with aeration provided by an aquarium pump, aquarium airline tubing and aquarium valves. Clear containers are covered with aluminium foil, butcher paper, black plastic, or other material to exclude light, thus helping to eliminate the formation of algae. The nutrient solution is changed either on a schedule, such as once per week, or when the concentration drops below a certain level as determined with an electrical conductivity meter. Whenever the solution is depleted below a certain level, either water or fresh nutrient solution is added. A <b>Mariotte's</b> <b>bottle,</b> or a float valve, can be used to automatically maintain the solution level. In raft solution culture, plants are placed in a sheet of buoyant plastic that is floated {{on the surface of the}} nutrient solution. That way, the solution level never drops below the roots.|$|R
40|$|Constructed {{wetlands}} {{have been}} studied by many research groups during over 40 years, but few aspects remain to be better understood as numerous information must be deeper verified. In the last years, aside the related research activity, also the efficiency aspects of this subject {{is becoming more and}} more important. For this reasons the authors decided to build inside our academic department courtyard an hybrid constructed wetland system (CW), using the most recent guidelines available at design time (Brix, 2005). The overall aim of this research was to investigate the CW system to the treatment of anaerobic digester outlet, modifying it to produce effluents that conform to Italian regulations for wastewater reuse. The tests also aim to verify the removal efficiency under increasing organic and hydraulic loading rate. The constructed plant consists in two parallel cells of subsurface vertical flow (V-SF), and one of horizontal subsurface flow (H-SF) of 1 m 3 each. The constant inflow, needed to feed the H-SSF pool, has been realized by gravity using a modified <b>Mariotte</b> <b>bottle.</b> In the V-SSF the water flow is vertical and intermittent and it is been allowed using electric pumps managed by pre-programmed timers. The system can work with a direct and inverse mode flow, with three different streams, one of 50 l/day (related with the initial physical model), one of 594 l/day (related with the second physical model) and a last one of 200 l/day that seems to be the most efficien...|$|E
40|$|Practical and {{validated}} {{methods to}} measure anisotropy of saturated, Ks, or field-saturated, Kfs, soil hydraulic conductivity {{on a single}} soil sample are still lacking. The objective {{of this investigation was}} to test factors affecting anisotropy measured in a sandy-loam soil by the constant-head laboratory permeameter and the modified cube method. The ratio, RK, between the conductivity results obtained with a long (6 h) and a short (0. 5 h) duration run varied from a minimum of 0. 29 to a maximum of 0. 88 with the considered experimental procedure, differing by both the employed constant-head device (<b>Mariotte</b> <b>bottle,</b> siphon) and the initial soil water content (unsaturated, saturated). Maximum time stability was detected with a siphon and an initially saturated soil sample, suggesting that soil alteration at the surface may influence the measured conductivity, and more reliable anisotropy measurements have to be expected for Ks than Kfs. A short-duration run carried out with a siphon and a calcium solution was also suggested for laboratory determination of Ks anisotropy since more representative results were obtained for a single cube of soil (i. e., horizontal, Kh, to vertical, Kv, conductivity ratio varying from 1. 78 to 1. 82 with the measurement sequence) as compared with the ones associated with using tap water (ratio varying from 1. 24 to 2. 09). The Kh/Kv ratio varied between 1. 80 and 2. 81 on two dates (April and July 2009) differing by the soil water content at the time of sampling (close to field capacity; lower than the permanent wilting point, respectively), and a significant temporal variability was only detected for Kv. Therefore, temporal variability of Ks anisotropy cannot be predicted by measuring one-dimensional Ks...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The {{effect of}} soil {{temperature}} and plant water stress on nitrogen uptake, growth rate and transpiration rate of wheat (Triticum aestivum VILL., Host) seedlings was studied. A special apparatus {{for the control}} of plant water stress and root temperature was used. Leaf area {{was measured by the}} air flow planimeter technique. Dry matter weight was determined with a Mettler balance after oven drying of the plant material. Nitrogen concentration in shoots and roots was determined by the micro-Kjeldahl procedure. The transpiration rate was obtained with a constant-water level graduated burette device operating on the principle of a <b>Mariotte</b> <b>bottle.</b> Growth rate of shoots and roots was slowest at the extreme temperatures with a maximum rate of growth occurring around a root temperature of 24 ° C. The growth rate was higher at a plant water stress of 0. 35 bar than at a plant water stress of 2. 5 bars. Rates of transpiration decreased steadily with increasing plant water stress. The increase of transpiration rate with root temperature increase was attributed to the change of water viscosity and increased root cell membrane permeability. The nitrogen content of roots and shoots increased as root temperatures increased from 10. 0 to 25. 0 °C, while {{there was no significant difference}} at plant water stresses of 0. 35 and 2. 5 bars. The increase in rate of nitrogen uptake was found to be proportional to the increase in rate of root growth. The same proportionality described a decrease in the rate of nitrogen uptake as a result of decreased rate of root growth. The rate of leaf area increase was found to be related to the rate of dry matter increase of the shoot. This relation was the same at all root temperatures and plant water stresses considered...|$|E

As colunas foram interligadas a frascos de Mariotte contendo água destilada e, em seguida, a frascos contendo água residuária. As concentrações relativas às amostras do efluente, correspondentes aos respectivos volumes de poros, foram utilizadas a fim de se obter as curvas experimentais de efluente para o potássio, cálcio e magnésio. Utilizou-se o programa Disp 1. 1 para, a partir dos dados das curvas de efluente, obter os valores dos fatores de retardamento (fR) e os coeficientes de dispersão-difusão (D) para os íons. Os maiores valores de fR foram obtidos para o potássio no LVd, seguido do cálcio no LVAd e por último o potássio no LVAd.

The depuration process done {{is called}} phytodepuration, which consists on the reduction or elimination of contaminants {{of the waste}} water, where the plants of the systems participated on it. A phytodepuration pilot plant has been designed and constructed, and it consists in two parallel cells of subsurface vertical flow (VSF), and one of horizontal subsurface flow (HSF), called hybrid system. The water flows horizontally through the porous media and the plants roots in the HSF, and are permanently flowed. The constant inflow is done by a <b>Mariotte</b> <b>bottle.</b> In the VSF the water flow is vertical and intermittent. The system can work with a direct and inverse mode flow, and {{it is designed to}} be used with two different flows, the normal one of 50 l/day and the winter one of 594 l/day. The plant is designed to treat grey water to reuse it after. Grey water is defined as the urban wastewater that includes water from bats, showers, hand basins, washing machines. The hydraulic circuit has been designed and constructed, using plastic pipes, pumps, plastic barrels, etc. The electrical circuit connects every timer to each pump. To set the flow the timers have to be programmed. The system has been studied by hydraulic balances, and a simulation program has been done according to the system limitations. The timing has been set and the plant has been started up with the direct mode and the normal operation flow with tap water. In other studying line, it has been done a literature review of constructed wetlands plants species to select them for the pilot plant according to the needs of our system: by their natural habitat, their removing capacity, their shape and measure. There have been 4 species selected: Phragmites australis, Typha latifolia, Carex elata and Juncus effusus. It has been done a review of the germination tests processes and a research of the optimum conditions of germination of the selected plants. Seeds of Typha latifolia were collected from the nature on November and after germinated. There have been done 4 germination tests, each one with distillate water and grey water. The capsules were placed under the fluorescents with constant light and the room temperature of 14 - 25 ºC. The percentage of germinated seeds has been more with distillate water than in grey water. The conclusion obtained from the tests done, it is {{that the best way to}} germinate is with constant light, with filter paper on a soil pot, and keeping them watered frequently.

40|$|Two-phase plumes play an {{important}} role in the more practical scenarios for ocean sequestration of CO{sub 2 } [...] i. e. dispersing CO{sub 2 } as a buoyant liquid from either a bottom-mounted or ship-towed pipeline. Despite much research on related applications, such as for reservoir destratification using bubble plumes, our understanding of these flows is incomplete, especially concerning the phenomenon of plume peeling in a stratified ambient. To address this deficiency, we have built a laboratory facility in which we can make fundamental measurements of plume behavior. Although we are using air, oil and sediments as our sources of buoyancy (rather than CO{sub 2 }), by using models, our results can be directly applied to field scale CO{sub 2 } releases to help us design better CO{sub 2 } injection systems, as well as plan and interpret the results of our up-coming international field experiment. The experimental facility designed to study two-phase plume behavior similar to that of an ocean CO{sub 2 } release includes the following components: 1. 22 x 1. 22 x 2. 44 m tall glass walled tank; Tanks and piping for the two-tank stratification method for producing step- and linearly-stratified ambient conditions; Density profiling system using a conductivity and temperature probe mounted to an automated depth profiler; Lighting systems, including a virtual point source light for shadowgraphs and a 6 W argon-ion laser for laser induced fluorescence (LIF) imaging; Imaging system, including a digital, progressive scanning CCD camera, computerized framegrabber, and image acquisition and analysis software; Buoyancy source diffusers having four different air diffusers, two oil diffusers, and a planned sediment diffuser; Dye injection method using a <b>Mariotte</b> <b>bottle</b> and a collar diffuser; and Systems integration software using the Labview graphical programming language and Windows NT. In comparison with previously reported experiments, this system allows us to extend the parameter range of our experiments to better match CO{sub 2 } injection scenario field conditions and to make detailed measurements of the experimental plumes. To date we have run a basic suite of experiments covering a range of injected fluids (air and oil), flow rates (0. 004 to 0. 083 1 /s), bubble/droplet sizes (0. 05 to 1. 5 cm), bubble slip velocities (5 to 35 cm/s), and ambient stratification types (linear and step). Qualitative observations of plume type (frequency and nature of peeling) from these experiments, as well as other experiments from the literature, have been correlated with dimensionless parameters to help us better characterize plume behavior. At the same time, quantitative data are being compared with a new analytical model which treats the flow as an upward-moving inner plume, coupled with an annular, downward-flowing outer plume which entrains from and intrudes into the ambient seawater. The model also includes CO{sub 2 } specific features such as bubble/droplet mass transfer, solute dissolution effects on plume buoyancy, and change in total CO{sub 2 } concentration and pH. We are continuing to conduct experiments which will provide additional data for model calibration. In turn, the model will be applied to CO{sub 2 } injection to help us better understand field-scale CO{sub 2 } releases, including those associated with the up-coming international field experiment...|$|E
