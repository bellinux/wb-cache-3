One such material is V_ 5 S_ 8, a metal with an antiferromagnetic ground state below the Néel temperature T_N∼ 32 K and a prominent spin-flop signature in the magnetoresistance (MR) when H||c ∼ 4. 2 T. Here we study nanoscale-thickness single crystals of V_ 5 S_ 8, focusing on temperatures close to T_N {{and the evolution}} of material properties in response to systematic reduction in crystal thickness. Transport measurements just below T_N reveal magnetic hysteresis that we ascribe to a metamagnetic transition, the first-order <b>magnetic</b> field-driven <b>breakdown</b> of the ordered state. The reduction of crystal thickness to ∼ 10 nm coincides with systematic changes in the magnetic response: T_N falls, implying that antiferromagnetism is suppressed; and while the spin-flop signature remains, the hysteresis disappears, implying that the metamagnetic transition becomes second order as the thickness approaches the 2 d limit. This work demonstrates that single crystals of magnetic materials with nanometer thicknesses are promising systems for future studies of magnetism in reduced dimensionality and quantum phase transitions.

The {{change in}} the Fermi surface of {{aluminium}} caused by alloying with gallium was studied by the method of quantum thermopower oscillations under <b>magnetic</b> <b>breakdown</b> effect conditions.

40|$|This thesis reports {{theoretical}} and experimental research {{on a novel}} accelerator concept using a photonic bandgap (PBG) structure. Major advances in higher order mode (HOM) damping are required {{for the next generation}} of TeV linear colliders. In this work, PBG HOMs are studied theoretically and experimentally for the first time. PBG HOMs are shown in simulation to be low Q lattice modes, removed from the cavity defect and beam position. Direct wakefield measurements were made in hot test using the bunch train produced by the MIT HRC 17 GHz linear accelerator. Measurements are compared with beam-loading theory, and wakefield simulations using ANALYST. Excellent agreement is observed between theory predictions and power measured in the 17 GHz fundamental operating mode; reasonable agreement is also seen with the 34 GHz wakefield HOM. In order to understand the performance of PBG structures under realistic high gradient operation, an X-band (11. 424 GHz) PBG structure was designed for high power testing in a standing wave breakdown experiment at SLAC. The PBG structure was hot tested to gather breakdown statistics, and achieved an accelerating gradient of 65 MV/m at a breakdown rate of two breakdowns per hour at 60 Hz, and accelerating gradients above 110 MV/m at higher breakdown rates. High pulsed heating occurred in the PBG structure, with many shots above 270 K, and an average of 170 K for 35 x 10 ⁶ shots. Damage was observed in both borescope and scanning electron microscope imaging. (cont.) No breakdown damage was observed on the iris surface, the location of peak electric field, but pulsed heating damage was observed on the inner rods, the location of magnetic fields as high as 1 MA/m. Breakdown in accelerator structures is generally understood in terms of electric field effects. PBG structure results highlight the unexpected role of <b>magnetic</b> fields on <b>breakdown.</b> The hypothesis is presented that the low level electric field on the inner rods is enhanced by pulsed heating surface damage, and causes breakdown. A new PBG structure was designed with improved pulsed heating, and will be tested. These results greatly further the understanding of advanced structures with wakefield suppression that are necessary for future colliders. by Roark A. Marsh. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Extraordinary magnetoresistance (EMR) in semiconductor-metal hybrids has been studied exclusively for sensor applications. However, some properties of EMR-based devices are potentially advantageous for power applications. A PSPICE finite-element model has been developed to aid in the analysis and design of semiconductor-metal hybrid devices for power applications. This paper presents the model theory, implementation, and results when applied to an externally-shunted van der Pauw (vdP) plate. The conventional 4 -terminal (4 -point) vdP probe configuration for sensors is compared to 2 -terminal (2 -point) probe positioning which is necessary for power devices. The effects of material properties on resistance and magnetoresistance (MR) for an externally-shunted vdP plate in both probe configurations are presented. Two prototype metal-semiconductor hybrid topologies for power applications have been derived from EMR sensor technology and are examined here for the first time, the shunted Corbino plate (SCP) and the externally-shunted Hall plate (ESHP). The PSPICE FEM model was used to analyze MR behavior as a function of geometric ratios characteristic of each new topology and semiconductor material properties. Sets of models for each topology generated using ElecNET were used to evaluate these devices' pulsed-current and breakdown limitations. The PSPICE model has the benefit of being versatile, simple, and computationally stable. Understanding the 2 -point resistance behavior of existing EMR sensors is a primary step in characterizing EMR-based power devices since it, and not the conventional 4 -point resistance, is of merit for power applications. The largest room-temperature MR ([delta]R/Ro) calculated for each prototype topology was approximately 2000 % at 1 T. Current concentration caused by the inclusion of a shunt was found to limit the pulsed current capacity in each device studied. For a common scale (13. 6 mm x 3. 4 mm x 1 mm), pulsed-current capacity was found to vary within each device topology according to a characteristic geometric ratio. The best candidate, in terms of MR, from the SCP family showed a 1 -ms pulsed current capacity of 323 A. In contrast, the pulsed current capacity of the best ESHP device was found to be 82 A. The best device geometries in terms of MR showed the lowest breakdown voltage among each set, both ̃ 200 V. The data set presented here is useful for purely characterization purposes. But also, these findings and the unavoidable trade-off between <b>magnetic</b> sensitivity and <b>breakdown</b> voltage indicate that potential advantages are offset by intrinsic limitations {{in the use of the}} EMR effect for power applications...|$|R
