25|$|The amiable Rev. James Sherman, at {{that time}} {{minister}} of Surrey Chapel, with his accustomed kindness took me in his carriage to the dinner; and afterwards, for four months, not only made <b>me</b> <b>his</b> guest, but made his house my home. I never lived so long with any other person, on the same terms. While I live, that dear gentleman will seem {{to me as a}} most generous fatherly friend.|$|E

25|$|When Boelcke {{suddenly}} emerged a few metres on {{the right}} from <b>me,</b> <b>his</b> machine ducked, I pulled up hard, however nevertheless we still touched...me, only {{one side of the}} undercarriage had torn away, him, the outermost piece of the left wing....violent gusts caused his machine to gradually descend more steeply, and I...saw it impact beside a battery position....My attempts to land beside my friend were made impossible because of the shell craters and trenches. Thus I flew rapidly to our field....|$|E

25|$|The Director General {{has advised}} {{me that he}} has found no {{evidence}} of any truth in the allegations. He has given <b>me</b> <b>his</b> personal assurance that the stories are false. In particular, he has advised me that all the Security Service officers who have been interviewed have categorically denied that they were involved in, or were aware of, any activities or plans to undermine or discredit Lord Wilson and his Government when he was Prime Minister. The then Director General has categorically denied the allegation that he confirmed the existence within the Security Service of a disaffected faction with extreme right wing views. He has further stated that he had {{no reason to believe that}} any such faction existed. No evidence or indication has been found of any plot or conspiracy against Lord Wilson by or within the Security Service.|$|E
25|$|I {{have not}} seen Chas. Greville's book, but have read {{a good deal of}} it. It is a social outrage. And {{committed}} by one who was always talking of what he called ‘perfect gentlemen.’ I don't think he can figure now in that category. I knew him intimately. He was the vainest being—I don't limit myself to man—that ever existed; and I don't forget Cicero and Lytton Bulwer; but Greville wd. swallow garbage, and required it. Offended selflove is a key to most of his observations. He lent me a volume of his MS. once to read; more modern than these; I found, when he was not scandalous, he was prolix and prosy—a clumsy, wordy writer. The loan was made à propos of the character of Peel, which I drew in George Bentinck's Life, and which, I will presume to say, is the only thing written about Peel wh. has any truth or stuff in it. Greville was not displeased with it, and as a reward, and a treat, told me that he wd. confide to <b>me</b> <b>his</b> character of Peel, and he gave me the sacred volume, wh. I bore with me, with trembling awe, from Bruton St. to Grosr Gate. If ever it appears, you, who have taste for style and expression, will, I am sure, agree with me that, as a portrait painter, Greville is not a literary Vandyke or Reynolds; a more verbose, indefinite, unwieldy affair, without a happy expression, never issued from the pen of a fagged subordinate of the daily press.|$|E

500|$|Hoglan {{worked as}} a roadie for the band after their {{lighting}} guy {{did not show up}} one night, and performed Lombardo's soundchecks. Slayer and Hoglan would play Dark Angel songs during soundchecks, which is how Hoglan eventually joined Dark Angel. Hoglan approached Dark Angel guitarist Jim Durkin: [...] "He came up to me one day and started giving <b>me</b> <b>his</b> criticisms of the band. He said we needed to be more evil. And then he goes, 'By the way, I'm a better drummer than the guy you have in Dark Angel right now.'" ...|$|E

500|$|A fan of Fringe, Pearl Jam {{musician}} Mike McCready {{talked with}} series composer Chris Tilton about writing some music for [...] "Northwest Passage". McCready said he started [...] "throwing ideas back and forth. And I {{think they just}} wanted a northwest guy to do it, because they were shooting it in the northwest". He elaborated that [...] "My role was smaller than someone who wrote all the music for it, but I think I was none the less integral in there. I mean, it was fun. Chris sent <b>me</b> <b>his</b> cues, and I just kind of rearranged them into guitar ideas".|$|E
500|$|After a 1–0 {{defeat at}} Stoke City on 7 November, a Britannia Stadium steward made an {{allegation}} of assault against Costa, which was resolved without further action. Also that month, Costa was again {{involved in a}} skirmish with Liverpool's Martin Škrtel, where he appeared to dig his boot into the Slovak defender's chest, but escaped punishment by the FA. On 29 November, Costa was an unused substitute in a match against Tottenham and threw his bib on the floor when Ruben Loftus-Cheek was sent on at his expense. Mourinho told the media that, [...] "For <b>me</b> <b>his</b> behaviour is normal. A top player on the bench will not be happy." ...|$|E
500|$|Cagney's next notable {{role was}} the 1955 film Love Me or Leave <b>Me,</b> <b>his</b> third with Day. Cagney played Martin [...] "Moe the Gimp" [...] Snyder, a lame Jewish-American gangster from Chicago, a part Spencer Tracy had turned down. Cagney {{described}} the script as [...] "that extremely rare thing, the perfect script". When {{the film was}} released, Snyder reportedly asked how Cagney had so accurately copied his limp, but Cagney himself insisted he had not, having based it on personal observation of other people when they limped: [...] "What I did was very simple. I just slapped my foot down as I turned it out while walking. That's all".|$|E

500|$|While {{the bulk}} of the film was shot on 4:4:4 HDCAM, {{according}} to director Guggenheim, a vast array of different film formats were used: [...] "There’s 35mm and 16mm. A lot of the stuff on the farm I just shot myself on 8mm film. We used four Sony F950 HDCAMs for the presentation. We shot three different kinds of prosumer HD, both 30 and 24. There’s MiniDV, there’s 3200 black-and-white stills, there’s digital stills, some of them emailed on the day they were taken from as far off as Greenland. There was three or four different types of animation. One of the animators is from New Zealand and emailed <b>me</b> <b>his</b> work. There’s JPEG stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|Georgia Tech coach John Heisman later {{described}} Strupper as follows:"Everett Strupper {{was a small}} {{package of}} condensed lightning when you turned him loose in an open field with a ball you wanted delivered somewhere {{in the neighborhood of}} the enemy's goal line. He was small, but he was put together like a high-powered motor. His arms and legs did just what his mind told them to do, and, believe <b>me,</b> <b>his</b> mind worked faster than Ty Cobb's when he's running the bases. Dodging and twisting, stiff-arming and hipping, he'd run the gauntlet of men big enough, you'd think, to pick him up and spank him, and most of the time, too, he'd get away from them, try as hard as they would." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{appointment}} of George Washington as Commander-in-Chief of the newly formed Continental Army on June 15, 1775, the Second Continental Congress asked the New York Provincial Government to select two men for service in the army. One {{would be a major}} general, the other a brigadier general. The assembly favored Philip Schuyler as the major general. Montgomery expressed concern over this, as he did not believe that Schuyler had enough combat experience for such an appointment. Montgomery wrote that [...] "Phil Schuyler was mentioned to <b>me...</b> <b>His</b> consequence in the province makes him a fit subject for an important trust– but has he strong nerves? I could wish to have that point well ascertained with respect to any man so employed." [...] Although Montgomery knew he was under consideration for brigadier general, he did not publicly show any desire for {{the appointment}}. Nonetheless, Schuyler was appointed major general, and Montgomery brigadier general, on June 22. Montgomery was ranked second in command of all the brigadier generals.|$|E

500|$|In February 1918, Watt was {{promoted}} to lieutenant colonel and given command of the AFC's 1st Training Wing (Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8 Squadrons) headquartered at Tetbury in Gloucestershire, England; the wing's role was to train replacement pilots for the four operational AFC squadrons in Palestine and France. Watt proposed moving the wing to France, but it remained in England. He was mentioned in despatches by Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig on 7April, and the commendation was gazetted on 28May. Shortly {{after the end of}} hostilities in November 1918, novelist William John Locke visited 1st Training Wing and found that [...] "there was not one [...] who...did not confide to <b>me</b> <b>his</b> pride in serving under a leader so distinguished". A pilot later opined that as well as having [...] "courage, determination, and an immense capacity for work", Watt possessed [...] "the greatest factor in leadership, a genius for endearing himself (without conscious effort) to all who served under him".|$|E

Povenmire jokingly responded [...] "That's a nice sentiment and all, but did he offer to give <b>me</b> <b>his?</b> No! And it's not like he doesn't already have two of his own just sitting in his house!" [...] Povenmire was nominated for an Annie Award for Directing in an Animated Television Production for the episode [...] "PTV" [...] (November 6, 2005) but lost out to a fellow Family Guy director Peter Shin, who had directed the episode [...] "North By North Quahog".

At the recording session for the song, Serch discovered that Nas {{did not have a}} recording contract and subsequently contacted Faith Newman, an A executive at Sony Music Entertainment. As Serch recounted, [...] "Nas was in a position where his demo had been sittin' around, 'Live at the Barbeque' was already a classic, and he was just tryin' to find a decent deal ... So when he gave <b>me</b> <b>his</b> demo, I shopped it around. I took it to Russell first, Russell said it sounded like G Rap, he wasn't wit' it. So I took it to Faith.
