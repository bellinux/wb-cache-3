50|$|Microfibers in {{textiles}} {{refer to}} sub-denier fiber (such as polyester drawn to 0.5 denier). Denier and Dtex are two measurements of fiber yield based on weight and length. If the fiber density is known, {{you also have}} a fiber diameter, otherwise it is simpler to measure diameters in micrometers. Microfibers in technical fibers refer to ultra fine fibers (glass or <b>meltblown</b> thermoplastics) often used in filtration. Newer fiber designs include extruding fiber that splits into multiple finer fibers. Most synthetic fibers are round in cross-section, but special designs can be hollow, oval, star-shaped or trilobal. The latter design provides more optically reflective properties. Synthetic textile fibers are often crimped to provide bulk in a woven, non woven or knitted structure. Fiber surfaces can also be dull or bright. Dull surfaces reflect more light while bright tends to transmit light and make the fiber more transparent.|$|E

40|$|Compared with {{conventional}} fibrous filters made of microfibers, the nanofibrous filters exhibit some special performances. Here, PVA nanofibrous membrane with thickness 28. 37 um {{was made by}} electrospinning 8 % PVA solution on conventional cotton scaffold. The air filtration test system was built to test the filtration performance between PVA nanofibrous membrane and conventional fibrous filters which include <b>meltblown</b> PP nonwoven filter and common cotton filter with 12 layers. In experiments, the filtration efficiencies of particles distribution 0. 3 - 5 um were attained, at the same times, another important parameter, pressure-drops, were observed. Through data analysis, {{it is found that}} the pressure-drop of cotton filter is the least, while the filtration efficiency is the least. The <b>meltblown</b> nonwoven filter has higher filtration efficiency, but pressure-drop increases accordingly. The nanofibrous filter has the best efficiency, while the pressure-drop is beyond respirator request. In addition, SEM is used to observe the particles distribution in filter, from the SEMS images of filters, the different filtration mechanisms are analyzed and discussed. Finally it is found that the direct inception and the inertial impact get obvious as diameter of nanofiber decreasing rapidly, so filtration process mainly concentrates on the surface of PVA nanofibrous membrane, almost no particles distribute in cotton scaffold.

40|$|Fuel-water {{filters are}} a {{promising}} {{solution for the}} removal of water from diesel fuel and frequently rely on a depth coalescing nonwoven medium and a barrier mesh. Water is a fuel contaminant that can cause severe damage to engine injectors by promoting corrosion and microbial growth. Coalescing water out of diesel fuel has become challenging because of the increasing amount of bio-diesel and performance enhancing additives that are present to meet emission control regulations. High water content and the reduction in interfacial tension (IFT) between the water and diesel are associated with formation of more stable emulsions and the generation of smaller water droplets that are harder to remove. This research systematically investigates the characteristics of bio-diesel and surfactant (monoolein) blends with standard diesel fuel, and explores the factors affecting the efficient removal of water from fuel by means of depth coalescing media composed of poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) <b>meltblown</b> fabrics. It was established that bio-diesel and monoolein do not influence the IFT of water in fuel in a comparable manner and the resulting water droplet size distributions (DSD) are substantially different, which has implications in terms of the interpretation of results from commonly used ISO and SAE standard test methods. Fuels blended with bio-diesel exhibited higher viscosity and water content than fuel freshly blended with monoolein. Online measurement of water droplet sizes revealed substantially smaller water droplets in bio-diesel blends compared to monoolien blends at the same IFT measured using offline tensiometry. The surface wetting characteristics of PBT <b>meltblown</b> media were modified by alkaline hydrolysis independently of fabric geometric configuration and treated fabrics exhibited greater coalescence efficiencies (up to a 150...|$|E

This paper reports {{the evolution of}} the surface nanostructures of <b>meltblown</b> polypropylene (PP) fibers during the process of plasma treatment fol-lowed by copper (Cu) sputter coating. The effects of plasma treatment and Cu sputter coating on the surface morphology, chemistry, and properties of the fibers were characterized using scanning probe microscope (SPM), environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), and electrical analysis. The atomic force mode (AFM) and lat-eral force mode (LFM) in the SPM were used to scan the fiber surface.

40|$|The {{surface of}} two {{commercial}} <b>meltblown</b> polypropylene (PP) membranes, {{used for the}} filtration of blood products, were modified by wet chemistry treatments (carbodiimide, tosyl chloride and trihalogeno-triazines) {{in the case of}} the oxygen-plasma treated membrane (O- 2 -PP), and by photochemistry using molecular clips {{in the case of the}} native PP membrane. The most efficient technique uses trifluoro-triazine reagent for the activation of both hydroxyl- and carboxyl-functions of O- 2 -PP. It enables the fixation of amine-terminated molecules with high degrees of derivatization (similar to 700 pmol/cm(2)), without inducing modification of the membrane morphology nor cytotoxicity. Only a weak decrease of surface hydrophilicity was measured after the treatments and steam-sterilization. This method was applied for the grafting of peptides (Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly, Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser, home-made modified Leu-Asp-Val) on O- 2 -PP membranes incorporated into multi-layer filter devices. These modified filters showed improved properties of leukocyte depletion in blood filtration experiments, principally due to the wetting properties of the membranes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, micropore blockage within its resin structure can easily lead {{to a reduction in}} the effectiveness of purification. To tackle this problem, we adopted the concept of membrane separation by combining electrospinning techniques with rapid alkaline hydrolysis to prepare a weak acid IEX nanofibrous membrane (AEA-COOH), consisting of polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) <b>meltblown</b> fabric as a supporting layer, with upper and lower IEX layers consisting of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibrous membranes. To determine the characteristics of the AEA-COOH membrane, we used the commercial product Sartobind&# 169; C IEX membrane as the standard of comparison. Results showed that the base weight and thickness of AEACOOH were 33 and 64 %, relative to Sartobind&# 169; C membrane. The thermo-degradable temperature of AEA-COOH membrane (320 °C) was far higher than that of Sartobind&# 169; C (115 °C), indicating high thermal stability.

In this study, {{the surface of a}} layer of <b>meltblown</b> oxygen-plasma treated polypropylene nonwoven (O 2 -PP), making part of the composition of leukodepletion filters, was modified with bioactive molecules to enhance the adhesion of leukocytes. These synthetic small molecules (called peptidomimetics) mimic the "Leu-Asp-Val" (LDV) tripeptide sequence recognized by the α 4 β 1 integrin, a receptor expressed on leukocytes. Their activity, as ligands of the α 4 β 1 integrin, was confirmed through cell adhesion assays. The peptidomimetics were covalently immobilized on O 2 -PP nonwoven via activation of the hydroxyl- and carboxyl-functions displayed on the polymer surface with trifluoro-triazine reagent, or were simply deposited on the O 2 -PP surface. The treated materials were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, wettability, and morphological analyses, before and after steam sterilization. Experimental filters composed of 10 layers of O 2 -PP nonwovens and a last layer modified with the peptidomimetics were evaluated, using whole blood filtration assays, for their leukodepletion efficiency, the recovery of red cells and platelets and the waste of blood, with an objective to design new filters fulfilling practical and medical criteria. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E
40|$|In {{nonwoven}} industry, meltblowing {{has been}} widely used as an important technique {{for the production of}} nonwoven webs consisting of microfibres, suitable for various applications. Recently, great attention is being paid to fabricate nonwoven webs consisting of nanofibres, commonly known as nanowebs. In this paper, polypropylene has been successfully used for the fabrication of nanowebs by meltblowing process with the injection of different fluids (such as air and water) at the vent port of commercial meltblowing equipment. The lowest average fibre diameters achieved were 755 and 438 nm by the use of air and water, respectively. Differential scanning calorimetry results showed the presence of single melting peaks in the first heating cycle and double melting peaks in the second, due to the re-crystallisation and re-organisation by heating during the experiments. The results obtained from thermo gravimetric analysis and intrinsic viscosity studies showed thermal degradation of the nanofibres during meltblowing. X-ray diffraction studies showed that all the <b>meltblown</b> polypropylene fibres produced with the injection of the fluids contained low degrees of crystallinity and monoclinic -form crystals.

Approximately 4000 pmol of (L) - 4, 5 -[3 H]-lysine was fixed per PBT sample (1. 13 cm 2) and measured by liquid scintillation counting. The method consisted in a two-step process: (a) coating of the clip (0. 05 mg/sample) on the fibrous surface of the PBT followed by UV irradiation (30 min, 254 nm) and (b) coupling of amine-terminated molecules (10 - 3 M in phosphate buffer-CH 3 CN [1 / 1, v/v], 20 h). Moreover, about 2000 pmol of 3 H-lysine can be immobilized on the PBT surface after UV irradiation (without clip) by aminolysis reactions with the created oxygenated functions. The derivatizations (via the clip and UV irradiation only) were stable after long-term heating at 100 °C in water or under steam-sterilization conditions. They induce neither modifications of the nonwoven morphology nor cytotoxicity.

40|$|In this paper, a novel {{technique}} for the fabrication of nanofibres of polypropylene by meltblowing process with the injection of different fluids (such as nitrogen and water) has been explained. Low molecular weight polypropylene polymers {{were used in}} this study. The surface morphology of nanofibres was analysed by scanning electron microscopy. It was observed {{that the use of}} water gave better results compared to nitrogen for the fabrication of nanofibres. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies revealed similar chemical shifts for polymers and nanofibres, which indicated no change to the chemical functionality of the nanofibres by the application of fluids and high temperature during meltblowing. The mechanical properties of the nanofibres were investigated by using dumb-bell-shaped specimens in a universal tensile tester. The fibres fabricated with nitrogen were weaker and lower in tensile modulus compared to the fibres fabricated with water. The use of a rotating collector increased the tensile strength compared to a stationary collector due to higher degree of fibre alignment in the rotating drum. The tensile strength and modulus values were increased after annealing due to the increase in the crystallinity.

40|$|Cellulose, {{the most}} {{abundant}} renewable organic material on earth, exhibits outstanding properties and useful applications, but also presents a tremendous challenge with regard to economical and environmentally friendly chemical processing. The viscose process, more than 100 year old {{is still the most}} widely utilized technology to manufacture regenerated cellulose fibers and films. Viscose fibers are produced today worldwide on a 5 million ton scale with various fiber types ranging from high performance tire yarn to textile filaments and staple fibers with excellent properties close to those of cotton. At Fraunhofer IAP, the technical equipment for viscose preparation, wet spinning of fibers, hollow fibers, and tube-like films is available on a min-plant scale. Research focused on raw materials testing, process optimization with regard to economic and ecological aspects, structural analysis of cellulose during processing, and structure-property relations of fibers and films. Similar to the viscose process, cellulosic fibers can be produced via cellulose carbamate as an environmentally friendly route. In a close cooperation of Fraunhofer IAP with industrial partners, a specific process based on cellulose carbamate was developed on a pilot plant scale, giving fiber properties close to those of conventional viscose fibers. In recent decades the N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO) -technology {{turned out to be a}} nonderivatizing commercial alternative to the still dominant viscose route. From the very beginning, Fraunhofer IAP has been engaged in investigating the structure formation of cellulose fibers precipitated from NMMO-water solution, revealing structural reasons for the fibrillation tendency of these fibers and means to overcome them. Starting from fiber formation via dry-jet wet spinning, for the first time the blown film formation and the <b>meltblown</b> nonwovens technology were developed for cellulosics on a pilot plant scale at Fraunhofer IAP. Based on the elastic behavior of the dope at elevated temperatures, cellulose can be processed like a melt in the air-gap, offering new possibilities of shaping cellulose like meltable mass polymers.

40|$|Melt blowing being {{a simple}} {{one-step}} process for converting polymer {{directly into a}} nonwoven fabric, is ideally suited for processing of several recycled plastics. The process uses hot air to draw the fibers and does not require precise, individual control of each filament as in the conventional fiber sprnning processes. It was demonstrated that recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) can be melt blown into nonwoven webs, but with poorer performance properties, due to the larger diameter of the fibers. Three methods of improving the melt blown processing of post-consumer recycled PET and the performance properties of the melt blown nonwoven webs produced from them were explored. They were, (1) using undried PET instead of dried PET, (2) blending recycled PET with other polymers, and (3) processing recycled PET at a higher temperature. The webs produced with undried PET had smaller fiber diameter, higher tenacity in the machine direction and lower air permeability. The greater drop in intrinsic viscosity indicated that more hydrolytic degradation occurred during processing of the undried PET. The webs produced from blends of recycled-PET/PBT as well as recycled-PET/low IV-PET had smaller fiber diameter, lower air permeability and higher tenacity in machine direction than those of 100 % recycled PET webs. There were no * Currently with Techmer PM, # 1 Quality Circle, Clinton, TN 37716. notable property changes caused by increasing the die temperature alone. The webs produced by increasing the barrel temperature {{as well as the}} die temperature had lower fiber diameter, lower thickness, lower air permeability and higher tenacity in machine direction. Intrinsic viscosities of webs which had improved performance properties were also considerably lower, indicating a significant drop in molecular weight of the recycled PET. Recycled PP form several sources were investigated as candidates for meltblowing and spunbonding. Pelletized waste form spunbond line was used in both spunbonding and melt blowing studies. SMS fabrics were also pelletized and <b>meltblown</b> at our facility. To explore the feasibility of using the J & M meltblowing line with the EG unit to remelt the waste web and feed it with the molten virgin polymer stream coming from the extruder, a 1000 MFR virgin PP resin and fabrics produced from that polymer were used.

40|$|This {{research}} achieved uniform nanofibres {{of polypropylene}} (PP) in melt electrospinning by using additives such as sodium oleate (SO) and sodium chloride (NaCl), which increased the electrical conductivity of the polymer melt. The average fibre diameters {{achieved by the}} use of pure polymers of 100, 300, 1000 and 2000 melt flow index (MFI) were in the range of 3. 01 - 14. 19 µm. The optimal amount of SO and NaCl were 7 % and 5 %, respectively for the fabrication of nanofibres from 1000 and 2000 MFI PP. The lowest average fibre diameters (achieved from 2000 MFI PP) were 0. 371 ± 0. 106 µm and 0. 310 ± 0. 102 µm corresponding to the optimum conditions of SO and NaCl, respectively. This research established {{the fact that there is}} no effect of the die shape on the cross-sectional shape of the meltelectrospun fibres. This study also demonstrated the scope of fabricating nanofibres by meltblowing with the injection of various fluids such as air, nitrogen (N 2) and water. The use of water worked better in terms of fibre morphology as compared to air and N 2 for the fabrication of nanofibres. The lowest fibre diameter of 0. 438 µm was achieved from the 300 MFI PP with water. This study also established the fact that the molecular weight was the predominant factor governing the fibre diameter in melt electrospinning. In contrast, the molecular weight was not the predominant factor governing the fibre diameter in meltblowing. The effective collector distances for nanofibre fabrication in the case of melt electrospinning were lower compared to the meltblowing. The polymer feed rate was substantially lower in the case of melt electrospinning (i. e. 0. 64 g/hr) compared to meltblowing (i. e. 80 g/hr). The results of energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) studies established the presence of additives in the melt electrospun fibres. Similar FTIR and NMR spectra of the polymer and the fibres indicated that there was no chemical change of the fibres fabricated by the application of various fluids and high temperature during meltblowing. The melting points of the fibres fabricated in melt electrospinning and meltblowing shifted to lower values compared to the initial polymer. This change was due to the thermal degradation caused by the high temperature during melt electrospinning and meltblowing. The degree of thermal degradation was higher in the case of meltblowing. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies showed that all the fibres fabricated by melt electrospinning and meltblowing contained low degree of crystallinity. The crystallinity, tensile strength and modulous of the <b>meltblown</b> fibres were increased with annealing. The fibres fabricated by melt electrospinning and meltblowing showed high values of contact angle indicating the hydrophobic nature.
