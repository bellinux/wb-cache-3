5000|$|For {{manufacturing}} IMO on {{a commercial}} scale, food industries use starch processed from cereal crops like wheat, barley, pulses (peas, beans, lentils), oats, tapioca, rice, potato and others. This variety in sources could benefit consumers who have allergies or hypersensitivity to certain cereal crops. The manufacturing process controls the degree of polymerization (dp) and the α(1,6)-linkages to ensure a consistent quality of IMO from different starch sources. The starch is first converted, by means of simple enzymatic hydrolysis, into high maltose syrup with di-, tri and oligosaccharides (2, 3 or more glucose units) having α(1,4)-glycosidic linkages which are readily digestible in the human intestine. These α(1,4)-glycosidic linkages are further converted into digestion-resistant α(1,6)-glycosidic linkages, creating [...] "iso" [...] linkages between glucose moieties and forming Isomalto-oligosaccharide (IMO). [...] The majority of oligosaccharides found in IMO consist of three to six monosaccharide (glucose) units linked together. However, disaccharides, as well as longer polysaccharides (up to nine glucose units), are also present. The disaccharide fraction of IMO consists mainly of α(1,6)-linked isomaltose, while maltotriose, panose, and isomaltotriose make up the trisaccharide fraction. A mixture of isomaltotetraose, isomaltopentaose, <b>maltohexaose,</b> maltoheptaose, and small amounts of oligomers with 8 or more degrees of polymerization, comprise the remaining oligomers in IMO. It {{should be noted that}} longer oligomers do not have 100% α(1,6)-linkages; the ratio of α(1,4)- to α(1,6)-linkages is variable.|$|E

These hydrophobic complexes {{are known to}} have an equilibrium binding constant that increases with the diacid chain length. However, the electrospray mass spectrometry (ES-MS) spectra showed that the relative intensity of the complex did not vary significantly with chain length. This contradiction is caused by a contribution of nonspecific adducts to the signal of the complex in ES-MS. In order to estimate the contribution of nonspecific adducts to the total intensity of the complexes with α-cyclodextrin, the comparison was made between α-cyclodextrin and <b>maltohexaose,</b> the latter being incapable of making inclusion complexes in solution.

One family member, cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase), has an uncommonly high transglycosylation activity {{and is able}} to form cyclodextrins. We have determined the 2. 0 and 2. 5 Å X-ray structures of E 257 A/D 229 A CGTase in complex with maltoheptaose and <b>maltohexaose.</b> Both sugars are bound at the donor subsites of the active site and the acceptor subsites are empty. These structures mimic a reaction stage in which a covalent enzyme-sugar intermediate awaits binding of an acceptor molecule. Comparison of these structures with CGTasesubstrate and CGTase-product complexes reveals three different conformational states for the CGTase active site that are characterized by different orientations of the centrally located residue Tyr 195. In the maltoheptaose and maltohexaose-complexed conformation, CGTase hinders binding of an acceptor sugar at subsite + 1, which suggests an induced-fit mechanism that could explain the transglycosylation activity of CGTase.

Alkaliphilic microorganisms found in these habitats have attracted a great interest due to their ability to produce extracellular enzymes that are active and stable at high pH values for industrial applications. Starch hydrolysing alkaliphilic bacteria were isolated from samples collected from hot springs around Lake Bogoria, Kenya and identified as Bacillus halodurans. These isolates were found to produce extracellular amylolytic enzymes active at pH 10. 0 and 55 ºC. The gene encoding Amy 34, a <b>maltohexaose</b> forming á-amylase from Bacillus halodurans isolate LBK 34, was sequenced, cloned and expressed in E. coli. From sequence analysis, the four conserved regions within the á-amylase family of enzymes and a carbohydrate binding module (CBM family 25) at the C- terminal were identified, while a structural similarity search revealed that the enzyme is related to cyclodextrin glycosyltransferases (CGTases). Recombinant Amy 34 is a monomer of 119 kDa, exhibiting optimum activity at pH 10. 5 - 11. 5 and 60 °C. The enzyme hydrolyses starch to form a mixture of maltooligosaccharides, the main product being <b>maltohexaose.</b> The enzyme could also hydrolyse ã-cyclodextrin but not á- and â-cyclodextrins. Thermal unfolding of Amy 34 is irreversible with four transitions, as determined by differential scanning calorimetry. A transition (denaturation) temperature, Tm of 70. 8 °C is obtained at pH 9. 0, which increases by 5 °C and decreases by 10. 4 °C when Amy 34 is heated in presence of 100 -fold molar excess of CaCl 2 and metal chelator, EDTA, respectively. These observations, together with the inhibitory effect of calcium ions observed at high concentrations on enzyme activity suggests that calcium plays a role in stabilisation rather than having a direct role in the catalytic activity of Amy 34. Amy 34 amylase was also used to generate starch hydrolysate for subsequent use as a carbon source for Halomonas boliviensis LCI, a moderate halophile, to produce a bioplastic, poly(â-hydroxybutyrate).

All these sugars were known to be metabolized to glucose 6 -phosphate and produced the same pattern of fermentation products. The differences in growth yields were ascribed to differences in energy costs for transport and phosphorylation of these sugars. A formalized treatment of these factors in determining growth yields was established and used to obtain values for the cost of transport and hence the energy-coupling stoichiometries for the transport of substrates via proton symport and binding-protein-dependent mechanisms in vivo. By this approach, the proton-lactose stoichiometry was found to be 1. 1 to 1. 8 H+ per lactose, equivalent to approximately 0. 5 ATP used per lactose transported. The cost of transporting maltose via a binding-protein-dependent mechanism was considerably higher, being over 1 to 1. 2 ATP per maltose or maltodextrin transported.

BAM 3 readily hydrolysed <b>maltohexaose</b> with a Km of 1. 7 mM and Kcat of 4300 s- 1 but activity was 3. 4 -fold lower with maltopentaose and was negligible with maltotetraose. With <b>maltohexaose</b> or amylopectin as substrates and using [UL- 13 C 12]maltose in an isotopic dilution method, we discovered that BAM 3 activity is inhibited by maltotriose at physiological (mM) concentrations, but not by maltose.

We hypothesise that the rate of starch breakdown in leaves can be regulated by inhibition of BAM 3 by maltotriose, the concentration of which is determined by DPE, which is in turn influenced by the stromal concentration of glucose. Since the plastid glucose transporter pGlcT catalyses facilitated diffusion between stroma and cytosol, changes in consumption of glucose in the cytosol are expected to lead to concomitant changes in plastid glucose and maltotriose, and hence compensatory changes in BAM 3 activity...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe action {{pattern of}} Bacillus licheniformis {{thermostable}} α-amylase (BLA) was analyzed using {{a series of}} 14 C-labeled and non-labeled maltooligosaccharides from maltose (G 2) to maltododecaose (G 12). Maltononaose (G 9) was the preferred substrate, and yielded the smallest Km= 0. 36 mM, the highest kcat= 12. 86 s− 1, and a kcat/Km value of 35. 72 s− 1 mM− 1, producing maltotriose (G 3) and <b>maltohexaose</b> (G 6) as the major product pair. Maltooctaose (G 8) was hydrolyzed into two pairs of products: G 3 and maltopentaose (G 5), and G 2 and G 6 with cleavage frequencies of 0. 45 and 0. 30, respectively. Therefore, we propose a model with nine subsites: six in the terminal non-reducing end-binding site and three at the reducing end-binding site in the binding region of BLA...|$|E
40|$|An {{intracellular}} alpha-amylase from Streptococcus bovis 148 was purified and characterized. The enzyme was {{induced by}} maltose and soluble starch and produced about 80 % maltotriose from soluble starch. Maltopentaose was hydrolyzed to maltotriose and maltose and <b>maltohexaose</b> was hydrolyzed mainly to maltotriose by the enzyme. Maltotetraose, maltotriose, and maltose were not hydrolyzed. This intracellular enzyme {{was considered to}} be a maltotriose-producing enzyme. The enzymatic characteristics and hydrolysis product from soluble starch were {{different from those of the}} extracellular raw-starch-hydrolyzing alpha-amylase of strain 148. The deduced amino acid sequence of the intracellular alpha-amylase was similar to the sequences of the mature forms of extracellular liquefying alpha-amylases from Bacillus strains, although the intracellular alpha-amylase did not contain a signal peptide. No homology between the intracellular and extracellular alpha-amylases of S. bovis 148 was observed...|$|E
40|$|An {{alpha-glucosidase}} {{with the}} ability to attack polymeric substrates was purified to homogeneity from culture supernatants of Thermoanaerobacter thermohydrosulfuricus DSM 567. The enzyme is apparently a glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 160 kDa. Maximal activity is observed between pH 5 and 7 at 75 degrees C. The alpha-glucosidase is active towards p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-glucoside, maltose, malto-oligosaccharides, starch and pullulan. Highest activity is displayed towards the disaccharide maltose. In addition to glucose, <b>maltohexaose</b> and maltoheptaose can be detected as the initial products of starch hydrolysis. After short incubations of pullulan, glucose is found as the only product. At high substrate concentrations, maltose and malto-oligosaccharide, but not glucose, are used as acceptors for glucosyl-transfer. These findings indicate that the T. thermohydrosulfuricus enzyme represents a novel type of alpha-glucosidase exhibiting maltase, glucohydrolase and 'maltodextrinohydrolase' activity...|$|E
40|$|Maltoporin allows {{permeation}} of long maltodextrin chains. It tightly binds the amphiphilic sugar, offering both hydrophobic {{interactions with}} a helical lane of aromatic residues and H bonds with ionic side chains. The minimum-energy path of <b>maltohexaose</b> translocation is {{obtained by the}} conjugate peak refinement method, which optimizes a continuous string of conformers without applying constraints. This reveals that the protein is passive while the sugar glides screw-like along the aromatic lane. Near instant switching of sugar hydroxyl H bond partners results in two small energy barriers (of approximately 4 kcal/mol each) during register shift by one glucosyl unit, in agreement with a kinetic analysis of experimental dissociation rates for varying sugar chain lengths. Thus, maltoporin functions like an efficient translocation "enzyme," and the slow rate of the register shift (approximately 1 /ms) is due to high collisional friction...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Maltoporin (which is encoded by the lamB gene) {{facilitates}} the translocation of maltodextrins across the outer membrane of E. coli. In particular, it is indispensable for {{the transport of}} long maltooligosaccharides, as these do not pass through non-specific porins. An understanding of this intriguing capability requires elucidation of the structural basis. RESULTS: The crystal structures of maltoporin in complex with maltose, maltotriose and <b>maltohexaose</b> reveal an extended binding site within the maltoporin channel. The maltooligosaccharides are in apolar van der Waals contact with the 'greasy slide', a hydrophobic path that is composed of aromatic residues and located at the channel lining. At the constriction of the channel the sugars are tightly surrounded by protein side chains and form an extensive hydrogen-bonding network with ionizable amino-acid residues. CONCLUSION: Hydrophobic interactions with the greasy slide guide the sugar into and through the channel constriction. The glucosyl-binding subsites at the channel constriction confer stereospecificity to the channel along {{with the ability to}} scavenge substrate at low concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Dissociation constans of rabbit muscle {{glycogen}} phosphorylases {{for various}} carbohydrates were measured by affinity electrophoresis. 1. Dissociation constants for glycogen at 5 ℃ was about one five-hundredth {{of that at}} 42. 5 ℃. In other words, affinity of phosphorylase for glycogen at 5 ℃ was approximately 500 times stronger than that at 42. 5 ℃. 2. Thermodynamic constants (△H^。 and △S^。) were calculated from the van't Hoff plots. The {{results indicated that the}} interaction between phosphorylase and glycogen was an exothermic reaction and the enzyme became of more ordered conformation. 3. The size of the carbohydrate-binding site of phosphorylase corresponds to that of <b>maltohexaose.</b> Cyclic maltose-type oligosaccharides competed with glycogen for the carbohydrate-binding site of phosphorylase. 4. All of the results mentioned above were quite similar for both phosphorylases a and b. From these results, it is concluded that glycogen and maltose-type oligosaccharides bind to phosphorylase at the glycogen storage site, and this site exists independently of the catalytic site and the AMP-binding site...|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} the complex forming ability of α-, β- and γ-cyclodextrins (α-CD, β-CD and γ-CD) with their open ring analogs. In {{addition to the}} native cyclodextrins also modified cyclodextrins and the corresponding maltooligomers, functionalized with neutral 2 -hydroxypropyl moieties, were synthesized. A new synthetic route was worked out via bromination, benzylation, deacetylation and debenzylation to obtain the 2 -hydroxypropyl maltooligomer counterparts. The complexation properties of non-modified and modified cyclic and acyclic dextrins were studied and compared by photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) and capillary electrophoresis (CE) using model guest compounds. In some cases cyclodextrins and their open-ring analogs (acyclodextrins) show similar complexation abilities, while with other guests considerably different behavior was observed depending on the molecular dimensions and chemical characteristics of the guests. This was explained by the enhanced flexibility of the non-closed rings. Even the signs of enantiorecognition were observed for the chloropheniramine/hydroxypropyl <b>maltohexaose</b> system. Further studies are planned to help the {{deeper understanding of the}} interactions...|$|E
40|$|Two linear alpha-(1, 4) -D-glucans substrates, {{of degrees}} of {{polymerization}} DP similar to 150 and 6000, {{were exposed to}} maize starch-branching enzyme IIa (mSBEIIa) in vitro. The resulting branched alpha-glucans and their constituent chains (obtained by debranching) were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). SEC data for the debranched species are presented as chain-length distributions, while those for branched species are presented as hydrodynamic volume distributions (HVDs), {{which is the most}} meaningful way to present such data (because SEC separates by size, not molar mass, and a sample of branched polymers with the same size can have a range of molar masses). A rigorous interpretation of the HVDs of the substrate and its branched product show that {{at least part of the}} branching is an interchain transfer mechanism in both the short- and long-chain substrate cases. A bimodal HVD of the in vitro branched alpha-glucan derived from the short-chain substrate was observed, and it is postulated that the divergence of the two populations is due to very small chains being unable to undergo branching. In the case of the in vitro branching of the long-chain substrate, the formation of <b>maltohexaose</b> during the reaction and the presence of a monomodal HVD were observed, suggesting a distinct mode of action of mSBEIIa on this substrate. Quantification of the branching level by NMR showed the branched glucans from both substrates had substantial amounts of branching (2. 1 - 4. 5 %), ascribed to the intrinsic nature of the action of mSBEIIa on the two substrates. It is postulated that differences in the degrees of substrate association affect the pattern of branching catalyzed by the enzyme, and a putative active site structure is proposed based on the appearance of <b>maltohexaose.</b> The molar mass distribution of the constituent chains of the in vitro branched alpha-glucans obtained by isoamylase treatment reveals the transfer of chains of specific size and supports the supposition given in the literature that mSBEIIa is responsible for short-chain branching in amylopectin. It is suggested that hydrodynamic volume SEC analysis should be used as a tool for the mechanistic investigation of SBEs, allowing SEC data of in vitro branched alpha-glucans to be both comparable and quantitative...|$|E
40|$|A novel α-amylase (AmyK 38) {{was found}} in {{cultures}} of an alkaliphilic Bacillus isolate designated KSM-K 38. Based on the morphological and physiological characteristics and phylogenetic position as determined by 16 S ribosomal DNA gene sequencing and DNA-DNA reassociation analysis, {{it was suggested that}} the isolate was a new species of the genus Bacillus. The enzyme had an optimal pH of 8. 0 to 9. 5 and displayed maximum catalytic activity at 55 to 60 °C. The apparent molecular mass was approximately 55 kDa, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the isoelectric point was around pH 4. 2. This enzyme efficiently hydrolyzed various carbohydrates to yield maltotriose, <b>maltohexaose,</b> maltoheptaose, and, in addition, maltose as major end products after completion of the reaction. The activity was not prevented at all by EDTA and EGTA at concentrations as high as 100 mM. Moreover, AmyK 38 was highly resistant to chemical oxidation and maintained more than 80 % of its original activity even after incubation for 1 h in the presence of excess H 2 O 2 (1. 8 M) ...|$|E
30|$|Noncovalent {{interactions}} between ligands and targeting proteins {{are essential for}} understanding molecular mechanisms of proteins. In this work, we investigated the interaction of Cytochrome c (Cyt c) with maltoligosaccharides, namely maltose (Mal II), maltotriose (Mal III), maltotetraose (Mal IV), maltopentaose (Mal V), <b>maltohexaose</b> (Mal VI) and maltoheptaose (Mal VII). Using electrospray ionization mass spetrometry (ESI–MS) assay, the 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 complexes formed by Cyt c with maltoligosaccharide ligand were observed. The corresponding association constants were calculated according to the deconvoluted spectra. The order of the relative binding affinities of the selected oligosaccharides with Cyt c were as Mal III > Mal IV > Mal II > Mal V > Mal VI > Mal VII. The {{results indicated that the}} stability of noncovalent protein complexes was intimately correlated to the molecular structure of bound ligand. The relevant functional groups that could form H-bonds, electrostatic or hydrophobic forces with protein’s amino residues played an important role for the stability of protein complexes. In addition, the steric structure of ligand was also critical for an appropriate interaction with the binding pocket of proteins.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSugar {{permeation}} through maltoporin of Escherichia coli, a trimer {{protein that}} facilitates maltodextrin translocation across outer bacterial membranes, was investigated at the single channel level. For large sugars, such as <b>maltohexaose,</b> elementary events of individual sugar molecule penetration into the channel were readily observed. At small sugar concentrations an elementary event consists of maltoporin channel closure by {{one third of}} its initial conductance in sugar-free solution. Statistical analysis of such closures at higher sugar concentrations shows that all three pores of the maltoporin channel transport sugars independently. Interestingly, while channel conductance is only slightly asymmetric showing about 10 % higher values at − 200 mV than at + 200 mV (from the side of protein addition), asymmetry in dependence of the sugar binding constant on the voltage polarity is about 20 times higher. Combining our data with observations made with bacteriophage-λ we conclude that the sugar residence time is much more sensitive to (and is decreased by) voltages that are negative from the intra-cell side of the bacterial membrane...|$|E
