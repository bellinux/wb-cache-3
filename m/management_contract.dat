Aside from the title, Marcelo also earned a contract with Sony BMG Music Philippines, a <b>management</b> <b>contract</b> with an agency of FremantleMedia's choice, a ₱1,000,000 non-exclusive contract with ABC, and ₱1,000,000 cash prize.|$|E
5|$|Epstein asked {{chartered}} accountant James Trevor Isherwood {{to set up}} a company to collect Lennon and McCartney's PRS payments—called Lenmac—which he did on 12 May 1964. When he first visited Epstein's office, Isherwood was surprised to learn that Epstein took 25 per cent of the gross income, and not the 10 per cent that he believed most other managers received at that time. All of Epstein's expenses were deducted from his artists' gross income, including office rental, staff wages, travel, telephone costs, and entertaining expenses. Before his death, Epstein knew that the renegotiation of his <b>management</b> <b>contract</b> (up for renewal on 30 September 1967), would lower his management fee from 25 to 10 per cent, and that NEMS would no longer receive a share of the Beatles' performance fees, reducing its revenues still further.|$|E

5|$|New strains {{developed}} between {{the band members}} regarding {{the appointment of a}} financial adviser, the need for which had become evident without Epstein to manage business affairs. Lennon, Harrison and Starr favoured Allen Klein, who had managed the Rolling Stones and Sam Cooke; McCartney wanted Lee and John Eastman – father and brother, respectively, of Linda Eastman, whom McCartney married on 12 March. Agreement could not be reached, so both Klein and the Eastmans were temporarily appointed: Klein as the Beatles' business manager and the Eastmans as their lawyers. Further conflict ensued, however, and financial opportunities were lost. On 8 May, Klein was named sole manager of the band, the Eastmans having previously been dismissed as the Beatles' attorneys. McCartney refused to sign the <b>management</b> <b>contract</b> with Klein, but he was out-voted by the other Beatles.|$|E
5|$|Her {{mother told}} Copeland {{that she would}} have to give up ballet, but Bradley wanted Copeland to {{continue}} and offered to host her. DelaCerna agreed to this, and Copeland moved in with Bradley and her family. Eventually, Copeland and DelaCerna signed a <b>management</b> <b>contract</b> and a life-story contract with Bradley. Copeland spent the weekdays with the Bradleys near the coast and the weekends at home with her mother, a two-hour bus ride away. Copeland would spend most of her next three years with the Bradleys. By the age of fourteen, Copeland was the winner of a national ballet contest and won her first solo role. The Bradleys introduced Copeland to books and videos about ballet. When she saw Paloma Herrera, a principal ballerina with ABT, perform at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Copeland began to idolize her as much as she did Mariah Carey. The media first noticed her when she drew 2,000 patrons per show as she performed as Clara in The Nutcracker at the San Pedro High School after only eight months of study. A larger role as Kitri in Don Quixote at the San Pedro Dance Center and a featured role in The Chocolate Nutcracker, an African American version of the tale, narrated by Debbie Allen, soon followed. The latter was presented at UCLA's Royce Hall. Copeland's role was modified especially for her, and included ethnic dances.|$|E

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science in Environmental Science and Policy, University of Wisconsin-Green Bay. " Thesis (M. S.) [...] University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, 2014. Resource <b>management</b> <b>contracts</b> define scopes and service levels, identify compensation methods, and establish cost and performance benchmarks for the avoidance, collection, re-use, recycling, and/or disposal of municipal solid waste (including garbage/trash and recyclable materials). As universities seek ways to become more sustainable, some have identified resource <b>management</b> <b>contracts</b> as an area with high potential for improved environmental performance and cost savings. This thesis documents a case study at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, which explored "greener" options for resource management on campus through the contracting process. During this project, the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay evaluated the current refuse and recycling removal and trash compacting services contract based on environmental and economic considerations, studied other institutions' waste management and resource <b>management</b> <b>contracts</b> and practices, issued a request for information to potential contractors, issued bid and contract documents intended to reduce environmental impacts while maintaining economic efficiency, and contracted for waste and recyclable material management services. This project faced many challenges, which are important learning opportunities for the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, {{as well as for}} other universities and institutions. As other higher education institutions look for new approaches to resource <b>management</b> <b>contracting,</b> this case study will serve as a reference for analyzing resource <b>management</b> <b>contracts,</b> developing and using requests for information, drafting "greener" request for bids or request for proposals documents, and awarding and administering resource <b>management</b> <b>contracts...</b>|$|R
25|$|In practice, {{according}} to the agency's annual reports up to 2004, {{it seems that the}} regulatory agency focused much of its activities in the water and sanitation sector on the supervision of the <b>management</b> <b>contract</b> for Electrogaz (now EWSA).|$|E
25|$|In 2003 the {{government}} signed a <b>management</b> <b>contract</b> with Lahmeyer International {{to manage and}} restructure ELECTROGAZ in collaboration with Hamburg Water Works for 5 years. In March 2006, the <b>management</b> <b>contract</b> was terminated {{and management of the}} company reverted to the Government of Rwanda. In 2009 Rwanda Water and Sanitation Corporation (RWASCO) was created, institutionally separating water supply and energy. However, only one year later it was absorbed into the Rwandan Energy Water and Sanitation Authority (EWSA). In 2008, RWASCO had signed a three-year agreement with the National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) of Uganda for performance improvement and to promote commercial service delivery. In 2014 the urban water sector was again separated from the energy sector, creating a water and sanitation utility, now called WASAC.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 the {{privatization}} program was expanded to drinking water supply when the Kingdom's first <b>management</b> <b>contract</b> was signed {{for the capital}} Riyadh, followed by two more management contracts (see below).

As of late 2014, the timing was pushed back to 2017/18 and NWC expected to take a 40% share {{in each of the}} Joint Ventures that would be selected to run the water and sewer systems of the three cities. According to NWC CEO Loay Al-Musallam the Joint Ventures can be profitable despite low water tariffs through the sale of treated effluent, because bulk water and capital investments are provided for free.|$|E
