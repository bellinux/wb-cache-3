5|$|Some {{problems}} remain: ?Oryzomys pliocaenicus, a Miocene fossil from Kansas, is of uncertain identity but may {{belong in}} Bensonomys, and fossils from the Miocene of Oregon and Pliocene of New <b>Mexico</b> <b>have</b> also been ascribed to Oryzomys, but probably incorrectly. A possible Oryzomys {{has been recorded}} from the Irvingtonian (Pleistocene) of Saskatchewan.|$|E
5|$|In the North Atlantic, feeding areas {{range from}} Scandinavia to New England. Breeding {{occurs in the}} Caribbean and Cape Verde. In the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, whales may breed off Brazil, as well the coasts of central, {{southern}} and southeastern Africa (including Madagascar). Whale visits into Gulf of <b>Mexico</b> <b>have</b> been infrequent, but occurred in the gulf historically. In the South Atlantic, about 10% of world population of the species possibly migrate to the Gulf of Guinea. Comparison of songs between those at Cape Lopez and Abrolhos Archipelago indicate that trans-Atlantic mixings between western and southeastern populations occur.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{renumbering}} in 2003, {{portions of}} US491 in New <b>Mexico</b> <b>have</b> been upgraded to a four-lane divided highway, with grade separations at the busiest interchanges. The New Mexico Department of Transportation has noted that, as sections are upgraded, fatality rates improve on the four-lane portions, but remain {{high on the}} two-lane portions. As construction has proceeded, the most dangerous portions of the highway have moved to points where the four-lane portion ends, and traffic merges to two lanes. This has caused the department to coordinate the phases of the upgrades to minimize the number of two-lane/four-lane transitions. Construction on the final phase was originally scheduled to begin January 2008, however the state applied for American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds to finish the project and completion was delayed until 2012.|$|E

2500|$|By {{naming the}} region [...] "New Mexico," [...] the Spanish likely hoped to {{incorporate}} a region {{as rich as}} <b>Mexico</b> <b>had</b> proven to be.

5|$|The {{principal}} {{sources of}} silver are the ores of copper, copper-nickel, lead, and lead-zinc obtained from Peru, Bolivia, Mexico, China, Australia, Chile, Poland and Serbia.

Top silver-producing mines are Cannington (Australia), Fresnillo (Mexico), San Cristóbal (Bolivia), Antamina (Peru), Rudna (Poland), and Penasquito (Mexico).
