This study aimed to explore the condition of the <b>mole</b> <b>drainage</b> formed in paddy soil with different clay contents. The study was conducted in a laboratory scale using a soil bin, a model of mole plough, and soil which was kept homogeneous in the boxes. The experiment was conducted at the Laboratory for Energy and Agricultural Engineering, Agricultural Engineering Department, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta. <b>Mole</b> <b>drainage</b> was installed in 3 paddy soils with different clay content, namely; 13. 12 % (soil A; loam soil), 41. 17 % (soil B; clay soil) and 53. 36 % (soil C; clay soil). The study was conducted by analyzing the geometry of the <b>mole</b> <b>drainage</b> and observing the soil deformation which occurred due to the formation of the <b>mole</b> <b>drainage.</b> The study showed that perfect mole drainages were installed in all of those three types of soil. The mole drainages were quite good and stable with little cracks. Based on the soil crack and ﬁ ssuring of soil, the largest soil deformation has occurred in soil with the highest clay content and the smallest one in soil with the lowest clay content. The characteristics of those three installed mole drainages were almost the same, but they had different effect on the rate of lowering soil moisture content.

40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the results of}} a series of field trials carried out on two sites, Ulfhäll and Fiholmsby in Södermanland, during the period 1998 - 2000. The aim of the trials was to evaluate the effects of <b>mole</b> <b>drainage</b> as a complement to tile drainage in combination with liming and variation in sowing date. The trial layout induded the following treatments and sowing dates: A = Control B = <b>Mole</b> <b>drainage</b> C = Piped <b>mole</b> <b>drainage</b> 1 = Conventional seedbed preparation with normal sowing date 2 = Conventional seedbed preparation with early sowing 3 = Sowing without harrowing and as early as possible a = Control b = Liming In the <b>mole</b> <b>drainage</b> treatments, the distance between drains was 3. 0 m and the drains were installed at 0. 5 m depth. Treatment b was limed with quicklime (CaO) 6 tons/ha. The plots were ploughed and levelled out in the autumn. Sowing treatments 1 and 2 were harrowed before sowing, while sowing treatment 3 was direct-drilled as early as possible. Yield and quality determinations, seedbed inspections, groundwater level and infiltration measurements and soil physical investigations in the laboratory were carried out for all plots. The soil at the Ulfhäll and Fiholmsby sites is a heavy to very heavy clay, and the soil at both sites contains some gyttja. At Ulfhäll, the hydraulic conductivity was very low in the topsoil and high in the subsoil, while at Fiholmsby, the conductivity was high throughout the profile to 80 cm depth. At both sites, the conductivity in the central topsoil of the limed plots increased to twice that in the control treatment. The yield results varied due to extreme variations in weather during the three-year experimental period. 1998 was an extremely wet year, while 1999 the precipitation was normal during the growing season. In 2000, there was a dry spring followed by a cool and rainy summer. The mild, wet winter and spring of 1997 - 1998 meant that the groundwater level in the soil was very high. The mole drains were water-filled for a time, causing some of them to collapse on both sites. The yield results from the trials showed that there were small and non-significant yield differences between treatments except for the first sowing without spring tillage treatment. In that treatment, the yield of grain was on average 10 % lower for a total of 5 harvest years. A pea crop showed yield increases of 8 and 5 % for sowing treatments 2 and 3 respectively. The effect of <b>mole</b> <b>drainage</b> was better on Fiholmsby than Ulfhäll. There was an average yield increase of 6 % for <b>mole</b> <b>drainage</b> on the Fiholmsby site. Liming produced grain yield increases of 2 and 5 % on Ulfhäll and Fiholmsby respectively, while it decreased pea yields overall by 8 %. The results of the investigation showed that <b>mole</b> <b>drainage</b> are not suitable on soils where the groundwater in the soil profile can rise to a high level. The mole drains can collapse and one must do the <b>mole</b> <b>drainage</b> over again. One way to avoid the mole drains to collapse are to put drain-pipe inside them.

40|$|The loss of {{nutrients}} to the aquatic environment caused by the irrigation of farm dairy effluent (FDE) is a prominent and contentious feature of dairy farming in New Zealand. This thesis investigates management practices and technologies with potential to reduce nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) losses in <b>drainage</b> water from <b>mole</b> and pipe drained dairy pasture soils irrigated with FDE. Farm dairy effluent management was both monitored, using remote sensing technologies, and modelled on a case study farm. During the winter and spring of 2008, an estimated 7, 890 m 3 of FDE was applied {{in excess of the}} soil water deficit (SWD). System constraints were the cause of about two-thirds (5, 070 m 3) of this over-applied FDE volume. It was estimated that as much as 502 kg TN and 83 kg TP could have been lost to surface waters due to inadequate infrastructure. The two main system constraints were the farm’s insufficient FDE storage capacity (2, 000 m 3) and the inability of the farm’s irrigator to apply small application depths (< 8 mm). Furthermore, this study highlighted the significant loss {{of nutrients}} that can occur under FDE irrigation and reinforced the need for tools to assist farmers with FDE management. A number of tools were developed to help farmers manage FDE irrigation. The use of a soil water balance, incorporating actual farm daily rainfall, is an effective method for informing the scheduling of FDE irrigations. Also, the risk of over-application of FDE to soils caused by travelling irrigator breakdowns or stoppages was substantially reduced by the use of a breakdown alert and automatic shut-off system developed and evaluated in this study. Given the elevated risk of P losses from soils treated with FDE, a method of capturing P from drainage waters was investigated. A field experiment was conducted to quantify the ability of Papakai tephra, installed into <b>mole</b> and pipe <b>drainage</b> systems, to remove P from drainage waters. This drainage system reduced TP losses in drainage by about 50 % (c. 0. 14 kg P/ha) over a drainage season, which equated to a 2. 8 kg P reduction for a 20 -hectare effluent block. As farmers frequently crop effluent block soils, the effect of summer forage cropping on nutrient losses was quantified. The practice of spring cultivating long-term dairy pasture, summer forage cropping and autumn regrassing increased the quantity of TN measured in drainage water, over three drainage seasons (2006 to 2008), by 84 % (21 kg N/ha), compared to long-term pasture. If this study had commenced in spring with a more typical pattern of rainfall and drainage, this increase is estimated to have only been about 23. 7 % (5. 9 kg N/ha). Based on these results, summer forage cropping is estimated to increase whole-farm drainage water N losses by about 5 %, when 10 % of a farm’s area is cultivated each year. Of the management practices and technologies studied, the greatest opportunity to reduce the losses of N and P to surface water from the case study farm’s effluent block, is through investment in FDE system infrastructure, particularly adequate storage capacity, and the use of decision support and fail-safe tools to assist the implementation of deficit irrigation of FDE...|$|R
40|$|The {{last decade}} {{has been a}} period of great {{expansion}} and land use intensification for the New Zealand dairy farming industry with a 44 % increase in national dairy cow numbers. Intensive dairy farming is now {{considered to be a}} major contributor to the deterioration in the quality of surface and ground water resources in some regions of New Zealand. Previous research has demonstrated intensive dairy farming is responsible for accelerated contamination of wateways by nutrients, suspended solids, pathogenic organisms and faecal material. A number of common dairy farming practices increase the risk of nutrient leaching. In particular, farm dairy effluent (FDE) has been implicated as a major contributor to the degradation of water quality. With the introduction of the Resource Management Act in 1991, the preferred treatment for FDE shifted away from traditional two-pond systems to land application. However, on most farms, irrigation of FDE has occurred on a daily basis, often without regard for soil moisture status. Therefore, it has been commonplace for partially treated effluent to drain through and/or runoff soils and contaminate fresh water bodies. The objectives of this thesis were to design and implement a sustainable land application system for FDE on difficult to manage, mole and pipe drained soils, and to assess the impacts of FDE application, urea application and cattle grazing events on nutrient losses via artificial drainage and surface runoff from dairy cattle grazed pasture. To meet these objectives a research field site was established on Massey University's No. 4 Dairy farm near Palmerston North. The soil type was Tokomaru silt loam, a Fragiaqualf with poor natural drainage. Eight experimental plots (each 40 x 40 m) were established with two treatments. Four of the plots represented standard farm practice including grazing and fertiliser regimes. Another four plots were subjected to the same farm practices but without the fertiliser application and they were also irrigated with FDE. Each plot had an isolated <b>mole</b> and pipe <b>drainage</b> system. Four surface runoff plots (each 5 m x 10 m) were established as subplots (two on the fertilised plots and two on the plots irrigated with FDE) in the final year of the study. Plots were instrumented to allow the continuous monitoring of drainage and surface runoff and the collection of water samples for nutrient analyses. An application of 25 mm of FDE to a soil with limited soil water deficit - simulating a 'daily' irrigation regime - resulted in considerable drainage of partially treated FDE. Approximately 70 % of the applied FDE left the experimental plots with 10 mm of drainage and 8 mm of surface runoff. The resulting concentrations of N and P in drainage and runoff were approximately 45 % and 80 % of the original concentrations in the applied FDE, respectively. From this single irrigation event, a total of 12. 1 kg N ha- 1 and 1. 9 kg P ha- 1 was lost to surface water representing 45 % of expected annual N loss and 100 % of expected annual P loss. An improved system for applying farm dairy effluent to land called 'deferred irrigation' was successfully developed and implemented at the research site. Deferred irrigation involves the storage of effluent in a two-pond system during periods of small soil moisture deficits and the scheduling of irrigation at times of suitable soil water deficits. Deferred irrigation of FDE all but eliminated direct drainage losses with on average < 1 % of the volume of effluent and nutrients applied leaving the experimental plots. Adopting an approach of applying 'little and often' resulted in no drainage and, therefore, zero direct loss of nutrients applied. A modelling exercise, using the APSlM simulation model, was conducted to study the feasibility of practising deferred irrigation at the farm scale on No 4 Dairy farm. Using climate data for the past 30 years, this simulation exercise demonstrated that applying small application depths of FDE, such as 15 mm or less, provided the ability to schedule irrigations earlier in spring and decreased the required effluent storage capacity. A travelling irrigator, commonly used to apply FDE (a rotating irrigator), was found to have 2 - 3 fold differences in application depth and increased the risk of generating FDE contaminated drainage. New irrigator technology (an oscillating travelling irrigator) provided a more uniform application pattern allowing greater confidence that an irrigation depth less than the soil water deficit could be applied. This allowed a greater volume to be irrigated, whilst avoiding direct drainage of FDE when the soil moisture deficit is low in early spring and late autumn. A recommendation arising from this work is that during this period of low soil water deficits, all irrigators should be set to travel at their fastest speed (lowest application depth) to minimise the potential for direct drainage of partially treated FDE and associated nutrient losses. The average concentrations of N and P in both 2002 and 2003 winter <b>mole</b> and pipe <b>drainage</b> water from grazed dairy pastures were all well above the levels required to prevent aquatic weed growth in fresh water bodies. Total N losses from plots representing standard farm practice were 28 kg N ha- 1 and 34 kg N ha- 1 for 2003 and 2004, respectively. Total P losses in 2003 and 2004 were 0. 35 kg P ha- 1 and 0. 7 kg P ha- 1, respectively. Surface runoff was measured in 2003 and contributed a further 3. 0 kg N ha- 1 and 0. 6 kg P ha- 1. A number of common dairy farm practices immediately increased the losses of N and P in the artificial drainage water. Recent grazing events increased NO 3 [...] N and DIP concentrations in drainage by approximately 5 mg litre- 1 and 0. 1 mg litre- 1, respectively. The duration between the grazing and drainage events influenced the form of N loss due to a likely urine contribution when grazing and drainage coincide, but had little impact on the total quantity of N lost. Nitrogen loss from an early spring application of urea in 2002 was minimal, whilst a mid June application in 2003 resulted in an increased loss of NO 3 [...] N throughout 80 mm of cumulative drainage suggesting that careful timing of urea applications in winter is required to prevent unnecessary N leaching. Storage and deferred irrigation of FDE during the lactation season caused no real increase in either the total-N concentrations or total N losses in the winter drainage water of 2002 and 2003. In contrast, land application of FDE using the deferred irrigation system resulted in a gradual increase in total P losses over the 2002 and 2003 winter drainage seasons. However, this increase represents less than 4 % of the P applied in FDE during the lactation season. An assessment of likely losses of nutrients at a whole-farm scale suggests that it is standard dairy farming practice (particularly intensive cattle grazing) that is responsible for the great majority of N and P loss at a farm scale. When expressed as a proportion of whole-farm losses, only a very small quantity of N is lost under an improved land treatment technique for FDE such as deferred irrigation. The management of FDE plays a greater role in the likely P loss at a farm scale with a 5 % contribution to wholefarm P losses from deferred irrigation...|$|R

A few known trials on this technique of drainage {{have been done}} in Ontario and Alberta. In England and New Zealand, this technique is widely used. The large surface of heavy clay soil cultivated in Abitibi-Temiscamingue makes this region an excellent choice for trying this technique. Two sites established on two soil series (Palmarolle, Roquemaure) have been moled in Abitibi-Temiscamingue. These soils represent 21 % of the cultivated land in this region. Twelve plots have been moled at varied depths, spaces and lengths. Physical and chemical soil properties have been measured to identify their influence on <b>mole</b> <b>drainage</b> stability.

Three types of drainage systems were simulated: (i) tile drains, (ii) tile drains with gravel trenches, and (iii) tile drains with gravel trenches and mole drains, using either two-dimensional (the former two systems) or three-dimensional (the latter one) transport domains. Three scenarios were considered to test the efficiency of each system: (i) time to drain an initially saturated system, (ii) high intensity rainfall, and (iii) a real case scenario.

Simulations showed that the spacing of tile drains with or without gravel trenches would have to be 40 % or 55 % smaller, respectively, in order to reproduce the same water table levels as those observed for the drainage system with mole drains.

The study concentrated on the modification of the soil physical environment and water transmission routes following loosening operations for autumn re-wetting, the winter period and spring drying.

Results from an intensive twelve month monitoring period indicate that the modification of subsoil to improve drainage does not necessarily give the results expected. In this study {{it has been shown that}} loosening of an unstable silty clay loam did not enhance drainage, in fact the reverse was true which can have dire consequences in terms of trafficability and plant root growth. Loosening lead to an increased porosity which resulted in a greater, albeit temporary, retention of water within the disturbed zone. This means that loosened soils were wetter prior to a rainstorm and remained so for a longer period after rainfall. This response, in turn lead to significant reductions in soil shear strength, which has important implications for successful crop husbandry in the autumn and spring periods when field operations are necessary.

40|$|Due to the {{combination}} of soils and climate in the U. K., most areas require some form of artificial drainage for successful agriculture. Rainfall, which is uniformly dis-tributed throughout the year, varies from approximately 600 mm to 1600 "/year from east to west. This rainfall exceeds evapotranspiration during winter and early spring {{in the east and}} for most of the year except for summer in the west. The majority of soils are medium to fine in texture with the largest proportion being clayey in nature.

Drainage practice is therefore very much a case of replacing or intensifying old systems.

40|$|No {{drainage}} {{work should be}} carried out before the drainage characteristics of the soil are established by a site and soil test pit investigation. • Two types of drainage system exist: a groundwater drainage system and a shallow drainage system. The design of the system depends entirely on the drainage characteristics of the soil. • Distinguishing between {{the two types of}} drainage systems essentially comes down to whether or not a permeable layer is present (at a workable depth) that will allow the flow of water with relative ease. If such a layer is evident, a piped drain system at that depth is likely to be effective. If no such layer is found during soil test pit investigations, {{it will be necessary to}} improve the drainage capacity of the soil. This involves a disruption technique such as moling, gravel moling or subsoiling in tandem with collector drains. • Drains are not effective unless they are placed in a free draining soil layer or complimentary measures (<b>mole</b> <b>drainage,</b> subsoiling) are used to improve soil drainage capacity. If water is not moving through the soil in one or other of these two ways, the water table will not be lowered. • Outfall level must not dictate the drainage system depth. If a free draining layer is present, it must be utilised. • Drain pipes should always be used for drains longer than 30 m. If these get blocked it is a drainage stone and not a drainage pipe issue. • Drainage stone should not be filled to the top of the field trench except for very limited conditions (the bottom of an obvious hollow). Otherwise it is an extremely expensive way of collecting little water. • Most of the stone being used for land drainage today is too big. Clean aggregate in the 10 – 40 mm (0. 4 to 1. 5 inch approx) grading band should be used.

40|$|Although {{subsurface}} drainage of pasture soils is widely practiced in New Zealand {{there is little}} information available which details the likely benefits of such drainage schemes. As drainage is becoming increasingly expensive {{there is a need}} for more quantitative data on which to base assessments of the likely cost-effectiveness of proposed schemes. The effect of {{subsurface drainage}} on certain soil and plant properties was investigated at a research site on a sheep and beef farm 6 km from Palmerston North. The soil type was a yellow-grey earth, with poor drainage due to water perching on the fragipan. Of nine plots, each 0. 4 ha in area, three were left undrained and six were mole drained. Three of the drained plots had conventional pipe collecting drains and the other three used major mole channels as collecting drains. The research site was grazed as part of the normal farm rotation. Data were collected in 1981 prior to the installation of drains, then from 1982 to 1984. Watertable levels were monitored in a series of four groundwater observation wells on each plot and the gravimetric water content of the top 30 mm of each plot was determined on a regular basis from soil cores. Soil temperature measurements were made at 50 mm depth on a pipe-mole and undrained plot, using thermistor thermometers, and at 100 mm depth on all the pipe-mole and undrained plots using mercury-in-glass thermometers. Pasture growth rates were measured in caged areas using a capacitance pasture meter and by mowing. Residual pasture left by the grazing animal was determined using small quadrats, the pasture meter and by visual assessment. Botanical composition was determined by point analysis and dissection of samples removed from the caged areas. Available soil nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur in the top 75 ram of each plot, and the total levels of these three nutrients in grass and clover grown on the plots, were measured using standard procedures. Two radioactive isotopes (32 P and 35 S) were used simultaneously to study the plant root activity on the undrained and pipe-mole plots. Data from groundwater observation wells showed that <b>mole</b> <b>drainage</b> was very effective at lowering the watertable following heavy rain in winter or spring. There was no significant difference between water-table depth on the pipe-mole and mole-mole plots. The close proximity of the watertable to the surface on the undrained plots was reflected in high soil water content values for the top 30 mm of soil. Differences in water content of the surface soil between drained and undrained plots did not affect the levels of extractable phosphate, sulphate, ammonium or nitrate or the pH in the top 75 mm of soil. Soil temperature measurements at 50 and 100 mm depth showed that drained plots did not warm any more quickly in spring than did undrained plots. A simple mathematical analysis confirmed that the lowering of the soil heat capacity by drainage would not be expected to affect soil temperature significantly in a yellow-grey earth under pasture. There was little difference in pasture growth rates and utilisation during the very dry winter and spring of 1982, but during mob grazing in the wetter winter of 1983 utilisation was approximately 25 % greater on drained than undrained plots. Subsequently, utilisation of pasture by sheep which were set stocked in spring continued to be poorer on the undrained plots, with approximately 35 % more residual dry matter remaining on the undrained than on the drained plots. From the time of mob grazing in July until the end of spring both mowing and the pasture meter data showed that growth rates were approximately 30 % greater on the drained plots. Point analysis at the end of spring revealed that on the undrained plots there was a 3 -fold increase in the incidence of weeds, a 4 -fold increase in the incidence of bare ground and a 2 -fold decrease in the incidence of clover compared with the drained plots. Almost identical results were obtained from herbage dissections. There was also a decrease in the concentrations of N, P and S in the dry matter of grass and clover grown on the undrained plots compared with that grown on the drained plots. These differences were for the most part small and ephemeral. Isotope uptake studies showed that in winter drainage enabled both grass and clover roots to extract both sulphate and phosphate from a greater depth, with approximately 6 % of the relative root activity occuring at 40 - 80 mm depth on the undrained plots compared with approximately 15 % on the drained plots. In spring, approximately 16 % of the relative root activity was at 80 - 200 mm depth on the undrained plots compared with approximately 26 % on the drained plots. The benefits of drainage became apparent only after grazing on a wet soil and were probably due to the effect that drainage had on the water content and so strength of the surface soil. Drainage increased the bearing strength of the surface soil, minimizing treading damage to both the sward and the soil structure and therefore enhancing both pasture utilisation during grazing, and subsequent regrowth. A simple mathematical model was developed, which used weather data to predict the watertable levels in both drained and undrained soil. By varying certain soil properties and drainage design parameters within the model, the limiting steps in the drainage process in the Tokormaru silt loam were investigated. The model was also designed to calculate the number of days over the winter-spring period on which the surface soil would be so wet that grazing would have the adverse consequences described above. In a year of average rainfall, <b>mole</b> <b>drainage</b> reduced the number of such 'unsafe' grazing days from 69 to 10. By comparing the number of 'unsafe' grazing days for different rainfall regimes some idea of the cost-effectiveness of drainage may be ascertained...|$|E
40|$|More {{than half}} of the {{cultivated}} lands in Egypt have only medium to poor productivity because of poor drainage or soil structure, salinity, sodicity, nutrient deficiency, or other problems. Land improvement work is carried out by the Executive Authority for Land Improvement Projects (EALIP), which was formed in 1971. However, {{after more than a decade}} of soil improvement works, many technical problems remained unsolved, and UNDP/FAO assistance was requested to support the EALIP in its experimental and demonstration work with a view to providing a sound basis for planning and implementing soil improvement programmesThe project has considerably strengthened and expanded the capabilities of the EALIP's Study, Research and Evaluation Sector (SRES). A major achievement was the establishment of five experimental and demonstration pilot farms, eight units in total, consisting of private smallholdings consolidated for crop and soil management purposes, but remaining under farmer management. Physical and economic data have been recorded on soil conditions and crop responses to soil and drainage treatments, and analysed to form the basis for detailed technical recommendations for the soil and water management of deteriorated soilsThe facilities provided at the SRES include an upgraded central laboratory, five sectorial laboratories, and a library. Multidisciplinary teams were formed, and links established with universities and other institutes. The training programme included overseas fellowships and study tours for 28 senior and professional staff; training in soil improvement technology for some 60 extension agents; and ongoing formal and informal training for laboratory and field staff. In addition, more than 1 000 farmers participated in field training and demonstration programmesThe project has made a number of recommendations at the strategic and planning level. In particular, a major investment was recommended for establishing integrated land improvement programmes on a large scale. An accelerated programme for renovating the entire system of primary and secondary drains, as well as pumping facilities, was also proposed. Other recommendations covered the use of <b>mole</b> <b>drainage</b> to supplement existing systems; the use of drainage water for irrigation; the consolidation of crops over contiguous small farm areas for more effective improvement operations; and fertility manage- ment as an integral component of soil improvementLocal investigations should always precede the adoption of a specific course of action, and it was recommended that the SRES of the EALIP continue the field trials programme to support, or modify as necessary, the recommendations made for soil improvement and fertility management. It was further recommended that the SRES assess benefits from soil improvement operations at the farm and area levels as well as at the micro (trial) levelIt was recommended that stronger cooperation be developed between the EALIP and the Extension Service of the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation, or alternatively that an extension section be formed within the SRES. Close cooperation should be maintained between the EALIP and other institutes and government ministries concerned with soil and water management in order to further a joint approach to problem solvin...|$|E
40|$|Subirrigation is {{a method}} of {{supplying}} water directly to the plant root zone under the ground surface by means of subsurfce drains which are also used to remove excess water from the root zone. Subsurface drainage systems are used to maintain appropriate levels of soil moisture in the root zone of a crop by managing the water table. Subirrigation is seen as being an economic alternative to conventional sprinkler irrigation systems on dairy farms where <b>mole</b> <b>drainage</b> systems are already installed. However, information on subirrigation of these fine textured soils is very limited. The primary focus {{of this study was}} to evaluate the hydraulic parameters limiting the use of subirrigation in fine textured soils. A field experiment was carried out on the Massey University No. 4 Dairy Farm in Palmerston North. During the study, a subsurface tile drainage system, with mole channels, was used to subirrigate 1248 m 2 of Tokomaru silt loam soil. The depth of irrigation applied was 185. 71 mm (232 m 3 of water added to the system). Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) was used to measure the soil moisture content to a depth of 400 mm at three positions, 5 m away from the drainage lateral and at three control points in an adjacent unirrigated plot. A theoretical daily water balance was developed for the irrigated plot and unirrigated control, based on the available weather data. The results from field experiment showed that sufficient water did not move from the drainage lateral to the moles. Reasons for this may include: (a) Not enough water applied, (b) Not enough pressure head was available to force water from the drainage lateral to the moles or (c) hydraulic conductivity of the backfill was too low. Having identified, from the field experiment, that the hydraulic connection between the lateral and mole was a potential problem, a bin model experiment was carried out in the hydraulic laboratory of the Agricultural Engineering Department. Two different backfill materials (gravel and tokomaru silt loam soil) were used with two mole positions in the bin relative to the drainage lateral. The flow rate and head losses through the system were measured for different applied pressure heads. The saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) of the backfill materials were measured in the laboratory and were measured other relevant physical properties (bulk density, particle density and porosity). The bin model experiment showed that flow rate through the system increases as the pressure head increases for both gravel and Tokomaru silt loam soil backfills. The flow rate with gravel backfill was eight times more than the flow rate with Tokomaru silt loam soil. For a gravel backfill the efficiency of hydraulic connection between the lateral and moles must only be in the order of 2 to 3 % for successful subirrigation. With a backfill of Tokomaru silt loam the efficiency of connection must be 10 to 20 %. This may not be achieved in the field as the hydraulic conductivity of the backfill will be of a similar magnitude to the surrounding soil leading to significant water losses vertically downward as well as horizontally. It is recommended that further field studies be conducted using gravel backfill. Further laboratory studies using other alternative backfill materials are also suggested...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The contrasted global {{population}} growth with the multiplication of the constraints to developing new irrigation systems puts a special challenge upon human crop production systems {{that needs to}} be taken up. The populations in many countries in Asia, Middle East and Africa are expected to double in the coming 50 years. The experience of the green revolution in Asia – during which 70 % of food production increase was provided by irrigated agriculture – shows that there is not only a need to strive to increase such crop production systems, but also to improve the production efficiency of existing ones. In fact, as a much worrying case, rice production in valley bottom irrigated lands of African Tropical Savannah is far to yield the expected amount of cereals. One of the major constraints to this production is iron toxicity subsequent to poor drainage conditions. According to Africa Rice, at least 60 % of the Tropical Savannah swampy valley bottoms are affected by different degree of iron toxicity. The yield in many areas drops to zero, leaving behind millions of disappointed and impoverished farmers. Therefore, {{it is not surprising that}} there is strong research dynamic – ranging from agronomy to microbiology – that strives to propose alleviating solutions to rice iron toxicity. Because prevalent anoxic conditions in the soil combined with iron reducing bacteria development were found a basic contributing factor to iron toxicity,  this research has chosen to investigate subsurface drainage potential contributions to solving this issue. Two complementary series of operations – designed within two project- components and focused on five basic questions closely related to the contributing factors to iron toxicity development – were performed. In fact, the research project was implemented in two major components: field surveys and designed experiments. The field surveys investigated iron toxicity triggering or aggravating factors such as clay proportions, ferrous ion Fe 2 + concentration, dissolved oxygen, soil acidity or water management. Drawing profit from the knowledge gained in survey research and literature review, two parallel experiments were designed using concrete microplots on one hand and buckets on the other hand, to statistically ascertain the impact of subsurface on soil acidity and ferrous iron concentration changes. All the operations performed within the two components of this research project endeavoured to answer the following five research questions:   how is ferrous iron formed and distributed in soils invaded by iron toxicity? how is clay spread within the valley? how is soil permeability affected by clay distribution in the valley? how can water management help improve soil conditions? what is the impact of subsurface drainage on iron toxicity?   The answers to these research questions – already published or in press – are exposed below, followed by the contribution of this research project in two areas: i) science en engineering, and ii) socio-economy. Clay and ferrous iron may deposit in strata High ferrous ion Fe 2 + concentration, inserted into dense clay strata, constitutes an important threat to rice production in several tropical Savannah valley irrigation schemes  of  West  Africa.  Many  actions  are  currently  undertaken  to  alleviate  iron   toxicity. In this study, we have investigated the presence of clay and ferrous iron stratifications within a typical flood prone valley bottom called Tiefora in Burkina Faso. Taking into account the multiple slopes of the valley, two randomized soil samplings were implemented at various depths. Samples were collected as deep as 500 cm, but especially at 30, 50 and 100 cm. The clay percentage was determined by grain size analysis. Ferrous iron concentrations were obtained through the reflectometric method. The stratifications of clay and ferrous ion Fe 2 + were checked using statistical hypothesis testing (ANOVA and Welch t-Test). Clay percentage within the first 100 cm top soil – 28. 9 % – was found twice higher than in the layers underneath. Furthermore, ferrous iron was mainly located in the top 30 cm, with a mean concentration of 994 mg/l. This ferrous iron concentration is much higher than found at depths 50 and 100 cm underneath (73 mg/l), while the pH of all the three layers is almost neutral. This striking stratification suggests several means of alleviating iron toxicity. Among these means, we propose maintaining wet conditions during the growing period in the irrigated lands in combination with leaching by subsurface drainage in the fallow periods.   Iron toxicity risk is higher in single season irrigation schemes   With the aim of finding the geochemical differences and helping to build alleviating strategies against iron toxicity, two hematite dominant valley bottoms irrigated rice soils were investigated in the Tropical Savannah region of Burkina Faso. The first site was Tiefora, a 16 ha modern double-season irrigated rice scheme and moderately affected by iron toxicity (10 % of the area with a toxicity score of 4). The second site was Moussodougou, a 35 ha traditional single-season irrigated rice valley-bottom, with 50 % facing more severe iron toxicity (score 7). Nine soil extracts were taken from three depths – 30,  50 and 100 cm – i. e. 27 at Tiefora  and 27 at  Moussodougou.   Five techniques were used to measure the data: i) the ferrous iron concentration was determined using a reflectometer, ii) a pH-meter yielded the pH, iii) clay-proportions were obtained by United States Department of Army (USDA) grain size analysis and densitometry, iv) the organic matter was determined by oven drying and v) the dry bulk density was determined by using undisturbed soil samples. Statistical hypothesis testing of One-way ANOVA and Welch t-test were applied to the data to isolate the similarities and the differences between the two sites. A geochemical analysis followed to find the causes of these differences. The results showed that while oxidation of pyrite leads to a simultaneous increase in Fe 2 + concentrations and acidity in the soils of coastal floodplains and  mangroves,  the oxidation of hematite in  Tropical savannah valley bottoms decreases Fe 2 + but also increases acidity during the dry season. As a consequence, it was found that the single-season irrigation scheme of Moussodougou is significantly (p-value 0. 4 %) more acidic (pH 5. 7) than the double-season system of Tiefora (pH 6. 4) with also 750 - 1800 mg/l higher ferrous ion Fe 2 +. The ferrous iron reached 3000 mg/l in some layers in Moussodougou. This result is a justification to modernize traditional single-season spate irrigation schemes into double-season irrigated rice schemes.   Subsurface drainage type depends on clay distribution   Waterlogged valley bottom soils of Tropical Savannah are areas where the richest traditional cropping systems are found, but they also face adverse physical and chemical conditions which can drastically drop rice yield. Subsurface drainage has been used for many areas to alleviate waterlogging. However, this drainage is dependent of clay distribution, type and location. The current research analysed these factors using the case of Tiefora. For this purpose nine boreholes, with depths from 2 to 6 m, were realised. Some 50 samples of soils were extracted at various depths, based on soil changes in texture and colour. These samples underwent grain-size-analysis. A comparative non-linear regression was performed on the clay distribution. Quadratic regression was the most appropriate. Clay proportions were high - 20 - 30 % in the 2 m topsoil - in the upstream and middle areas. A more important - 30 - 40 % - peak was reached in the downstream area at 1 m-depth, with a much smaller thickness (less than 50 cm) and higher permeability. These results suggest the application of <b>mole</b> <b>drainage</b> in the valley, except downstream where the classical Hooghoudt pipe subsurface drainage can be implemented.   Subsurface drainage cost can be reduced by taking into account permeability distribution in valley   In flood prone Tropical Savannah valley soils very low infiltration rates often result in acidic conditions favourable to high concentrations of metallic ions, toxic for rice. The infiltration rate determination is important in drainage design to reclaim degraded soils. Several studies have addressed the mapping of the infiltration rate. Yet its relationship with the toposequence of the valley is not clarified. This research has investigated such possibility, examining the case of the irrigated rice valley of Tiefora. Nine boreholes – 1 to 5 m deep – were implemented from upstream to downstream. The Lefranc permeability test of under phreatic conditions in waterlogged soils – used when the impervious layer is close to soil surface or absent – was conducted. First, a comparative regression was applied to the data, including all the parameters of the regression curves. In case of dissimilarity of the infiltration processes, the comparison focused on the final permeability. Our results show a permeability increase from upstream (0. 10 ± 0. 10 cm/hr) to downstream (greater than 20. 0 ± 10. 0 cm/h in some places). Taking into account such permeability increase in subsurface drainage system design would result in the implementation of more efficient and cost effective systems.   Data based water management can help to reduce water losses and solve water inequity frictions between farmers   Surface irrigation represents more than 99 % of the irrigated area in West Africa and generally includes valley bottoms dedicated to irrigated rice production, which are often denounced as water overusing schemes. Surprisingly, there is neither follow up nor analysis of the irrigation water used in these gravity irrigation systems. Such a work was carried out in the case of the 16 ha Tropical Savannah irrigated rice valley bottom scheme of Tiefora. Using the flow equation of the concrete weir at the headwork, daily water use volumes were calculated as time series covering more than one-year period. The moving average trend analysis reveals that during both the rainy season (1200 mm of rainfall) and the dry season (no rainfall), the main canal gate is almost never closed, keeping a minimum discharge of 200 m 3 /day for 4 ha (50 mm/day versus. a local evapotranspiration of 7 mm/day). That stresses the necessity of a more rigorous water management. Furthermore, the autocorrelation analysis by using the ARIMA model showed that the irrigation cycle that ensures equity in water distribution among farm plots is 20 days instead of five. The knowledge of this fact can defuse potential conflicts about equity among farmers: the lack of water in day 4 may be compensated later during the 20 -day cycle. It appeared that a simple water level measuring device – installed at the headwork of the main irrigation canal – can produce a time series to which autoregressive moving average model can be applied to yield, at low cost, a thorough assessment of water management in this surface irrigation system.   Subsurface drainage alleviates iron toxicity in mean and long run   Iron toxicity is one of the most important constraints that hinder rice productivity in Tropical Savannah valley bottom irrigated fields, but fortunately that can be alleviated. A too high ferrous iron level in the soil can nullify rice yield. Several research fields – agronomy, pedology through microbiology – strive to provide a solution to this issue. Up to date, the contribution of hydraulics to tackle iron toxicity remained limited. The current research addressed this aspect through controlled experiments on highly ferrous iron contaminated rice hematite soils. Twelve concrete microplots and eight buckets were used to implement two independent designed experiments during a period of 86 days. Drainage and liming were the two factors whose impacts were investigated. Drainage was used with two treatment conditions: 0 mm/day and = 10 mm/day, and liming also had two treatment conditions: Lime- = 0 kg/m&sup 2; and Lime+ = 1 kg/m&sup 2; per unit increment increase of the pH. Four different responses in the soil were measured: ferrous ion concentration Fe 2 +, pH, oxido reduction potential, and the dissolved oxygen. For the rice, toxicity scores of the International Rice Research Institute were followed up. The results indicate an increase of Fe 2 + from 935 mg/l to more than 1106 mg/l (at 95 % of confidence level), but, which is interesting, with a significant decrease of soil acidity from pH 5. 6 to 7. 3 (95 % confidence level). Liming had the same effect in alleviating the acidity. Reduction processes were not hindered by subsurface drainage since the oxydo reduction potential dropped from 84. 6 to 9. 2 mV, and dissolved oxygen moved from 1 mg/l to less than 0. 1 mg/l. Despite of the reduction of the acidity, with such a high ferrous iron level as 1106 mg/l, the iron toxicity score reached 7 in the twelve microplots and the rice died. Still, the reduction of soil acidity provides a new insight on the hematite soils behaviour, opposite to the acidification with subsurface drainage in coastal floodplains and mangrove pyrite. Furthermore, it will lead to less ferrous iron intake by rice roots and in such perspective improve the rice yield. Finally, though liming can achieve the same result, subsurface drainage takes the advantage when this mineral is not available or is expensive.   Project outputs for Tiefora farmers   From the investigations and their supporting activities, two major benefits were brought to the farmers of Tiefora. First, in order to alleviated iron toxicity – which is much less severe in this place than in Moussodougou – and improve rice yield (less than 4 tons/ha), it would be essential to apply according the norms of the Institute of Environment and Agricultural Research (IN. ERA) the complex fertilizer NPK. However, this application should go along with making well built bunds around the farm plots in order to confine the fertilizer and make the mineral more available for the rice roots. This  will invigorate the crop  and thus  strengthen  its resistance to iron toxicity. Secondly, the project handed to the farmers’ association of Tiefora three key documents: i) an aerial photo the environment of the valley of Tiefora, including the reservoir, the village, the roads and the irrigated valley, ii) a topographical map of the valley bottom, intended to help in potential engineering works on the irrigation system, and iii) a detailed map of the farm plot system, accompanied with the complete list of the farmers and their farm sizes, and the location of iron intoxicated plots for their daily activities   Project outputs for Moussodougou farmers   Based on the investigation results and due to the severe iron toxicity in Moussodougou, the project provided several advices and handed some key documents to the farmers. Ferrous iron concentration in the soil of Moussodougou can reach 3000 mg/l in many farm plots with acidity as severe as pH 4. Since its incorporation into the soil was found to induce the growth of iron reducing bacteria activity, and given the positive conservation impact of organic matter in lightening the soil structure,  the  project advised the farmers to reduce its use but not to eliminate it completely. In parallel, farmers would have to use the complex NPK as in Tiefora, according to the norms of IN. ERA, but combine it with a careful erection of plot bunds to make the mineral element more available for the rice. Due to the fact that the current single irrigation season during the year in Moussodougou is an aggravating factor of iron toxicity, the project also introduced to the  farmers association its ongoing work of developing sprinkler irrigation from groundwater during the dry season. Finally, the project handed to the farmers’ association the same set of documents as in Tiefora, but related to the valley bottom of Moussodougou.   Other social impacts   In an ultimate effort to share the insights gained about the iron toxicity alleviation process, this research project produced and uploaded onto the social media YouTube several useful videos. The 15 videos uploaded and accessible for everybody, deal with areas as varied as hydrometrics, microbiology, geochemistry and small scale water saving irrigation equipment assembling at village level (without electricity). Many of these videos were very appreciated by the audience. For example, the video of "Innovative irrigation systems in Sub-Saharan Africa (French) " has been viewed/downloaded 500 times/month. Similarly, the video "How to take a sample of disturbed soil or resting in soil immersed at different depths (English) ", was viewed/downloaded some 45 times/month. These two videos were classified "creative common" due to their high potential appropriation by third party video productions. Hence, it is expected that the project will have an even higher social impact in the coming months or years.  ...|$|E
