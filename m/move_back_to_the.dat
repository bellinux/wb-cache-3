5|$|Adults {{make their}} homes within holes in various {{mangrove}} trees and maintain an arboreal existence whereas the young are strictly terrestrial {{for the first}} year of their lives. As the Utila iguana cannot successfully lay its eggs in the mangrove swamps, the gravid females are forced to migrate to nearby sandy beaches in order to bury their clutches of eggs so they can incubate in the hot sun. After digging their nest burrows and laying their eggs, the females abandon the nests and return to the mangroves. Sixty to seventy-four days later the hatchlings emerge and <b>move</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> swamps.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of rest and recovery, Zita found herself {{regularly}} going back to Europe for the weddings of her children. She decided to <b>move</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> continent full-time, in 1952, to Luxembourg, in order to look after her aging mother. Maria Antonia {{died at the age}} of 96 in 1959. The bishop of Chur proposed to Zita that she move into a residence that he administered (formerly a castle of the Counts de Salis) at Zizers, Graubünden in Switzerland. As the castle had enough space for visits from her large family and a nearby chapel (a necessity for the devoutly Catholic Zita), she accepted with ease.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Ross {{had signed}} Georges Boucher as coach, but Boucher {{did not work}} well with Ross and team {{president}} Weston Adams. Looking to hire a new coach {{in the summer of}} 1950, Ross phoned Lynn Patrick, the son of Lester, who had just resigned from the New York Rangers after coaching the team to the Stanley Cup Final. Lynn had moved his family back to Victoria, British Columbia, where he grew up as a child, with the intention of coaching the Victoria Cougars, a team in the minor professional Pacific Coast Hockey League. Though reluctant to <b>move</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eastern United States, Lynn was hired by Ross after he was offered a salary of $12,000. He would coach the team for the next four seasons and become the second general manager of the Bruins when Ross retired at the end of October 1954.|$|E

5|$|Oliver {{arrives at}} Holby City Hospital as an F1 doctor, {{alongside}} his sister Penny (Emma Catherwood). He acquires Penny's preferred rotation on the Acute Assessment Unit (AAU), where he develops a flirtatious relationship with ward sister Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley). Within weeks, their relationship becomes sexual. Chrissie becomes pregnant, but later miscarries. They break up, and Oliver {{moves on to}} date ward sister Daisha Anderson (Rebecca Grant). A transfer to the cardiothoracic surgery ward has him working under registrar Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel). While Daisha spends Christmas with her family in the Philippines, Oliver kisses Jac. Upon her return, Daisha learns of the tryst. Soon thereafter, she is shot during a hostage situation and Oliver struggles to cope. Although she recovers, she opts to leave Holby and <b>move</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Philippines.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of 10 April, leading {{elements}} of the Austrian army crossed the Inn River and invaded Bavaria. Bad roads and freezing rain slowed the Austrian advance in the first week, but the opposing Bavarian forces gradually retreated. The Austrian attack occurred about a week before Napoleon's anticipations, and in his absence Berthier's role became all the more critical. Berthier (whose fortè was staff work) {{proved to be an}} insufficient field commander, a characteristic made worse by the fact that several messages from Paris were being delayed and misinterpreted when they finally arrived at headquarters. Whereas Napoleon had written to Berthier that an Austrian attack before 15 April should be met by a general French concentration around Donauwörth and Augsburg, Berthier focused on a sentence that called for Davout to station his III Corps around Regensburg and ordered the Iron Marshal to <b>move</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city despite massive Austrian pressure.|$|E
5|$|Monroe's early {{childhood}} was stable and happy. While Gladys was mentally and financially unprepared for a child, {{she was able}} to place Monroe with foster parents Albert and Ida Bolender in the rural town of Hawthorne soon after the birth. They raised their foster children according to the principles of evangelical Christianity. At first, Gladys lived with the Bolenders and commuted to work in Los Angeles, until longer work shifts forced her to <b>move</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city in early 1927. She then began visiting her daughter on weekends, often taking her to the cinema and to sightsee in Los Angeles. Although the Bolenders wanted to adopt Monroe, by the summer of 1933, Gladys felt stable enough for Monroe to move in with her and bought a small house in Hollywood. They shared it with lodgers, actors George and Maude Atkinson and their daughter, Nellie. Some months later, in January 1934, Gladys had a mental breakdown and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. After several months in a rest home, she was committed to the Metropolitan State Hospital. She spent {{the rest of her life}} in and out of hospitals, and was rarely in contact with Monroe.|$|E

5|$|The ITCZ became {{active in}} the middle of March {{northeast}} of Madagascar, which spawned two low pressure areas on March15. The westernmost became a tropical disturbance on the next day between Madagascar and Tromelin. It quickly intensified while tracking to the southwest and was named Justine on March17. On March18, the storm intensified into tropical cyclone status and developed a well-defined eye. At 15:00UTC that day, Justine moved ashore northeastern Madagascar near Sambava. It continued southwestward and weakened over the island, emerging into the Mozambique Channel near Besalampy as a tropical storm. It re-intensified into a tropical cyclone over waters, reaching peak winds of 150km/h (95mph) on March22 only 20km (12mi) offshore Mozambique. That day, a ridge over southern Africa steered Justine to the southeast away from land, although the ridge weakened and allowed the storm to <b>move</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west-southwest. It weakened to a tropical storm during this time. The storm turned again to the southeast on March24 after the ridge moved to the east. Justine passed north of Europa Island before striking Madagascar again early on March25 just north of Toliara. It became extratropical over land, and soon again reached open waters while turning to the south. Justine dissipated on March27 within the flow of the westerlies.|$|E

25|$|The three clubs of the Gothenburg Alliance (Göteborgsalliansen)GAIS, IFK Göteborg and Örgryte ISplayed the {{majority}} of their matches on the old Gamla Ullevi from its inauguration in 1916 until the newer Ullevi stadium was completed in 1958 for the 1958 World Cup in Sweden. From that year most matches were played on the large stadium with a capacity of over 40,000, but as the attendance numbers decreased in the 1980s and early 1990s, and in connection with the removal of the terraces, calls for a <b>move</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> old stadium was heard. After a renovation, Gamla Ullevi was from 1992 once again the home of the Alliance clubs.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, for Raiders home games, {{tarpaulins}} {{were placed}} over seldom-sold sections, reducing seating capacity to approximately 65,000. The changes were anticipated {{to be the}} first of a multi-stage renovation designed by HNTB that would have turned the Coliseum into a split-bowl stadium with two levels of mezzanine suites (the peristyle end would have been left as is). After the 1994 Northridge earthquake, however, $93 million was required from government agencies (including the Federal Emergency Management Agency) to repair earthquake damage, and the renovations demanded by the Raiders were put on hold indefinitely. The Raiders then redirected their efforts toward a proposed stadium at Hollywood Park in Inglewood before electing to <b>move</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum prior to the 1995 season. The last element of the Northridge earthquake repairs was the replacement of the condemned press box with a new press box in 1995.|$|E

That night, the Dauntless traitors, led by Eric, arrive and shoot simulation serums on their fellow Dauntless members while at the same throw smoke gas, which knocks all unconscious except for the Divergents — Tris, Uriah Pedrad, and several others. While Eric is executing some of the Divergents, Tris wounds him, giving time for the Dauntless members not breathing the gas, including Tobias, to capture him and force the other traitors to flee. Their safety is revealed to be guaranteed by an Erudite renegade and Will's sister, Cara.|$|E
25|$|After {{two years}} at Hamilton, Lord's growing disaffection with college life caused him to {{suddenly}} move to Canada with a friend, where he became editor-in-chief of a national newspaper, The Canadian. After just one year in that position, he decided to <b>move</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States and specifically Buffalo. In his diary, he cites finances as a reason; indeed, {{when he arrived in}} Buffalo, he had enough money for just a single meal and only one night's stay in a hotel. Almost immediately after his arrival, he was hired by the law firm of Love & Tracy, then the preeminent lawyers of western New York. He quickly became a popular figure, and well respected by Buffalo society, and was chosen to represent the city in the United States semi-centennial celebrations. In 1825, at Buffalo's quarter-century celebrations, he was also chosen to speak, in which he recounted the more colorful side of Buffalo's history, recalling a panther killed in the street, the city's vicious rivalry with nearby Black Rock during its village years, and the construction of the Erie Canal.|$|E
25|$|The Snows' {{marriage}} was strained and the Japanese occupation {{of much of}} China made life difficult. In December 1940, the Snows decided to <b>move</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States in fear that the Japanese would make them prisoners of war. The attack on Pearl Harbor would take place exactly one year later. Prior to their departure, Ed was offered a position as a war correspondent for the New York Herald Tribune and Helen encouraged him to take it. She returned to the United States without him.
