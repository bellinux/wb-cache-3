5|$|Keli was {{the second}} of three {{tropical}} cyclones to affect Tonga during a ten-month period, with Cyclones Hina and Ron affecting the island nation during March 1997 and January 1998. Ahead of the system impacting Tonga, the FMS issued cyclone warnings for the Niuas and strong wind warnings {{for the rest of}} Tonga. As a result of the warnings a vessel that was heading to the island group had to be recalled, which was predicted to affect supplies on the islands when it was likely to be <b>most</b> <b>needed.</b> During June 13, Keli caused some damage to the islands with plantations, breadfruit trees and other large trees devastated. The strong winds also destroyed several residences while causing damage to public buildings.|$|E
5|$|On several {{occasions}} during the war, Hines {{was forced to}} make narrow, seemingly impossible, escapes. At one point, he concealed himself in a mattress that was being used at the time; on another occasion, he was confused for the actor and assassin John Wilkes Booth, a dangerous {{case of mistaken identity}} that forced him to flee Detroit in April 1865 by holding a ferry captain at gunpoint. Union agents viewed Hines as the man they <b>most</b> <b>needed</b> to apprehend, but apart from the time he served at the Ohio Penitentiary in late 1863, he was never captured.|$|E
5|$|One day, Indra, {{the king}} of the Devas (celestial deities), {{disguised}} as a Brahmin, approaches Karnan and asks for his armour and ear rings in donation to weaken and stop him from overpowering Arjuna. Aware of Indra's intention, Karnan yet donates both the items he was born with and which would make him invincible. Pleased with Karnan's generosity, Indra gives him a powerful weapon, Nagastra, but states that he can use it only once. Karnan, disguised as a Brahmin, becomes the student of the sage Parasurama to acquire the Brahmastra; one day, however, Parasurama realises that Karnan is a Kshatriya, a tribe he opposes. Enraged, he renders Karnan incapable of using the Brahmastra when <b>most</b> <b>needed,</b> and banishes him.|$|E

5|$|Planning for the {{demobilisation}} of the Australian military {{began at}} the end of 1942 when the Department of Post-War Reconstruction was formed. The department was involved with drawing up plans for determining veterans' entitlements and the assistance which would be provided to discharged personnel to help them settle into civilian life. This included planning the delivery of training, housing and ensuring that jobs were available. An important consideration was to ensure that civilian employment opportunities were created at an appropriate rate as the size of the military was reduced. In order to achieve this, it was decided to continue many wartime economic regulations such as price controls in order to limit inflation and direct resources to where the Australian Government believed they were <b>most</b> <b>needed.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{process was}} not without obstacles, however. The Neapolitan nobles distrusted Skanderbeg since the Kastrioti family had {{previously}} been allied with Venice. Alfonso himself had been offended when he asked Skanderbeg to attack Venice along with Đurađ Branković and the Albanian refused. Alfonso was also a devout Christian and found it uneasy to ally with Skanderbeg who had previously practiced Islam in the Ottoman court. On the other hand, Skanderbeg had been disillusioned when Alfonso failed to send any troops to Krujë when they were <b>most</b> <b>needed.</b> But things changed once Skanderbeg had thwarted the Ottoman Army. Both Venice and Alfonso grew an interest in expanding their powers in the Adriatic and the Ionian. On 26 March 1451, the Treaty of Gaeta was signed, creating an Albanian-Aragonese alliance.|$|E

He distrusted mercenaries (a distrust that he explained in his official reports and then later in his theoretical works for their unpatriotic and uninvested nature in the war that makes their allegiance fickle and often too unreliable when <b>most</b> <b>needed)</b> and instead staffed his army with citizens, a policy that was to be repeatedly successful.

25|$|The Siege of Trebizond was the {{successful}} siege {{of the city}} of Trebizond, capital of the Empire of Trebizond, by the Ottomans under Sultan Mehmed II, which ended on 15 August 1461. The siege was the culmination of a lengthy campaign on the Ottoman side, which involved co-ordinated but independent manoeuvres by a large army and navy. The Trapezuntine defenders had relied on a network of alliances that would provide them with support and manpower when the Ottomans began their siege, but failed at the moment Emperor David Megas Komnenos <b>most</b> <b>needed</b> it.|$|E

25|$|The ADF was not {{sufficiently}} prepared for integrating women into all units. Integration was hindered by entrenched discriminatory attitudes, {{sexual harassment and}} a perception that less demanding standards were applied to women. This led {{to a number of}} scandals, including allegations of sexual harassment on board , and the RAN's mishandling of these complaints. These scandals did great harm to the ADF's reputation at the time when it <b>most</b> <b>needed</b> servicewomen. The Defence Equality Organisation was established in 1997 in response to these problems, and it developed frameworks to facilitate the acceptance of women throughout the ADF.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} (training) of Jesuits {{seeks to}} prepare men spiritually, academically, and practically for the ministries {{they will be}} called to offer the church and world. Saint Ignatius was strongly influenced by the Renaissance, and he wanted Jesuits {{to be able to}} offer whatever ministries were <b>most</b> <b>needed</b> at any given moment and, especially, to be ready to respond to missions (assignments) from the pope. Formation for priesthood normally takes between eight and fourteen years, depending on the man's background and previous education, and final vows are taken several years after that, making Jesuit formation among the longest of any of the religious orders.|$|E

The manufacturing and transportation facilities of the South were not capable of this ambitious program, however. Some of the projected fleet were completed in time to defend Mobile after the lower bay had been lost, but they were not there when <b>most</b> <b>needed.</b> Nevertheless, they imparted some urgency to Farragut's plans to maintain the blockade.|$|E

25|$|As president, Rafsanjani was {{credited}} with spurring Iran's reconstruction following the 1980–88 war with Iraq. Rafsanjani was popular with the upper and middle classes, partially due to his economic reforms during his tenure and his support for human rights (in comparison to the Khomeini years) which have been widely perceived as successful for the most part. However, his reconstruction efforts failed to reach the rural or war zones where they were <b>most</b> <b>needed,</b> leaving him unpopular {{with the majority of}} the rural, veteran, and working class populations. His reforms, despite attempting to curb the powers of the ultra-conservatives, failed to do so, and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards received increasing power from Khamenei during his presidency. He was also accused of corruption by both conservatives and reformists, and was known for tough crackdowns on dissent.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 2006, the Geographic Exclusion Area (GEA) was {{expanded}} to include other parts of New York City outside of Manhattan. Related to the GEA, the 421-a tax abatement affects the entire city, but the requirement for affordable housing only affects construction projects in the GEA. Generally, these areas are located where housing prices are the most expensive and where affordable housing is <b>most</b> <b>needed.</b> The entire GEA is in New York City. Under the current program, all of Manhattan {{is part of the}} GEA. In addition, the Queens and Brooklyn waterfronts are part of the GEA as well, along with parts of northern Staten Island, a small area in central Queens, and {{a small portion of the}} Bronx. The GEA boundaries are established by both state and local laws.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{communities}} {{were under the}} control of the bishop in each diocese rather than Edmund Rice, and this created problems when Brothers were needed to be transferred from one school to another. Rice sought approval from Pope Pius VII for the community to be made into a pontifical congregation with a Superior General. Ultimately he obtained this, and as Superior General he was then able to move brothers across diocesan boundaries to wherever they were <b>most</b> <b>needed.</b> In the 1820s further difficulties emerged owing to the expansion of the society and its becoming two distinct congregations. From this time on they were called Christian Brothers and the Presentation Brothers. The motto of the Christian Brothers was: 'The Lord has given, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord forever' (Job 1: 21).|$|E
