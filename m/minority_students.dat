5|$|Heins {{discusses}} the Supreme Court case Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, a landmark {{on affirmative action}} for <b>minority</b> <b>students</b> in university and college admissions. The case (decided in 1978) upheld affirmative action in the admission of <b>minority</b> <b>students</b> as one of several factors to consider, not the primary one. In the lawsuit, the affirmative-action standards at UC Davis School of Medicine were challenged; the school had a policy of holding 16 out of 100 slots for minorities in the incoming class of students, regardless of qualification. Potential student Allan Bakke, a qualified white applicant, challenged the practice after he {{was rejected by the}} school. In an opinion written by Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., the court ruled against racial quotas at the school while allowing minority status to remain one of several criteria in the admissions process.|$|E

Boston also operates the United States' second-oldest public high school and its oldest public elementary school.

5|$|While at Princeton, she got {{involved}} with the Third World Center (now known as the Carl A. Fields Center), an academic and cultural group that supported <b>minority</b> <b>students,</b> running their day care center, which also included after school tutoring. She challenged the teaching methodology for French because she felt {{that it should be}} more conversational. As part of her requirements for graduation, she wrote a thesis titled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community. She researched her thesis by sending a questionnaire to African American graduates, requesting they specify when and how comfortable they were with their race prior to their enrollment at Princeton and how they felt about it when they were a student and since then. Of the 400 alumni to whom she sent the survey, fewer than 90 responded, and her findings did not support her hope that the black alumni would still identify with the African American community, even though they had attended an elite university with all of the advantages that accrues to its graduates. She majored in sociology and minored in African American studies, graduating cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in 1985.|$|E

25|$|When Aelony {{arrived at}} the University of Minnesota, he met some of the few {{students}} of color and discovered {{that only a small}} number were from the local communities, since most local blacks chose to attend black colleges and universities in the South. He also found that other <b>minority</b> <b>students</b> were having trouble obtaining local housing and employment in Minneapolis. Aelony worked with a group of students to help find housing for Persian students. This population had difficulty securing housing because it was rumored that they rubbed their skin with olive oil, which ruined the bedding. If the <b>minority</b> <b>students</b> were told an apartment complex was full, white students would go ask for a room there to test the fairness of the renters. The students would then talk to the renters, who were often embarrassed and would agree to rent to the <b>minority</b> <b>students.</b>|$|E
25|$|In January 2017, Dr. , a {{sociologist}} and former JCU student, {{suggested that the}} university consider renaming the school after an individual that more appropriately embodies Jesuit ideals and signals an embrace of diversity to <b>minority</b> <b>students.</b> He also recommended that the university revise its admissions procedures and direct more attention to recruiting <b>minority</b> <b>students.</b> The university has stated {{that it has no}} plans to change its name, but it has established a campus research group to more closely examine John Carroll's involvement and support for slavery.|$|E
