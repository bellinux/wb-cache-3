40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a theoretical framework for the design and analysis of microstrip reflectarrays. In particular the applicability of a stub loaded <b>microstrip</b> <b>element</b> for reflectarray designs is investigated. A rigorous solution to the scattering of a stub loaded <b>microstrip</b> <b>element</b> is formulated in the spectral domain and solved using moment method techniques. Both isolated and infinite arrays of stub loaded elements are treated. A functional relationship between the phase and amplitude of the scattered field to the length of the stub which terminates the <b>microstrip</b> <b>element</b> is established. This functional relationship is then employed to design a finite reflectarray as well as predict the performance of the array over a wide frequency range. The theoretical projections are supported by experimental evaluations including the design, fabrication and measurement of a C-band microstrip reflectarray. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The typical {{single-layer}} patch {{printed on}} a dielectric substrate is a narrow-band element. This well-known fact is mainly {{due to the}} limitations imposed by the dielectric substrate. From efficiency and cost considerations, {{in most of the}} cases, the substrate cannot be too thick. In order to increase the <b>microstrip</b> <b>element</b> bandwidth, additional resonators in different configurations and combinations can be used: parasitic elements, slots, etc. However, the microstrip antenna element with the widest bandwidth (a variation of the aperture-fed stacked-patch element) is about 40 – 50 %. This antenna, an aperture-fed stacked patch, has a relatively poor front-to-back ratio, {{due to the fact that}} it has a slot in the ground plane. In this paper, a new type of patch element is presented. The patch is suspended over the ground plane and supported by a nonconductive pin. It is fed by a three-dimensional (3 -D) transition connecting the patch to a perpendicular connector. The typical bandwidth of this element (in terms of VSWR) is 90 %.

While microstrip antenna technology has been developed for radio communications, {{it has yet to}} be applied to combined radar and radiometer for Earth remote sensing. The antenna feed provides a key instrument element enabling high-resolution radiometric observations with large, deployable antennas. The design is based on the microstrip stacked-patch array (MSPA) used to feed a large, lightweight, deployable, rotating mesh antenna for spaceborne L-band (approximately equal to 1 GHz) passive and active sensing systems.

40|$|One of humankind’s {{greatest}} {{natural resources}} is {{the electromagnetic spectrum}} and the antenna {{has been instrumental in}} harnessing this resource. The aim of the thesis is to Design and fabricate a coaxial fed rectangular Microstrip Antenna and study the effect of antenna dimensions Length (L), Width (W) and substrate parameters relative Dielectric constant (rε), substrate thickness on Radiation parameters of Band width and Beam width. A Microstrip antenna consists of conducting patch on a ground plane separated by dielectric substrate. Low dielectric constant substrates are generally preferred for maximum radiation. The conducting patch can take any shape but rectangular and circular configurations are the most commonly used configuration. Other configurations are complex to analyze and require heavy numerical computations. A Microstrip antenna is characterized by its Length, Width, Input impedance, and Gain and radiation patterns. The length of the antenna is nearly half wavelength in the dielectric; it is a very critical parameter, which governs the resonant frequency of the antenna. In view of design, selection of the patch width and length are the major parameters. The dielectric constant (permittivity) {{plays a major role in}} the overall performance of a patch antenna. It affects both the width, in turn the characteristic impedance and the length resulting in an altered resonant frequency. The Bandwidth of the patch antenna depends largely on the permittivity (εr) and thickness of the dielectric substrate. Ideally, a thick dielectric, lower permittivity (εr), low insertion loss is preferred for broadband purposes. Desired Patch antenna design is initially simulated by using IE 3 D simulator. And Patch antenna is realized as per design requirements. From the result I observed that the experimental antenna parameters are coinciding with simulated results. Beam width of a <b>Microstrip</b> <b>element</b> can be increased by choosing a smaller element, thus reducing W and L.

40|$|With the {{advancement}} of wireless communication systems, low cost, minimal weight, compact and low profile antennas are in great demand for both commercial and military applications. Furthermore, as the size of wireless hand-held devices shrinks, it is desirable to integrate the antenna directly on the chip package to cut down cost and provide flexible integration. Conformal low-profile antennas, such as printed dipoles, rectangular patches and slots, are widely used in large arrays on ground based, vehicular, air-borne and shipboard applications. Microstrip patches are usually used as radiating elements also in arrays and planar reflector antennas. These traditional resonant structures are typically half a wavelength in the critical dimensions and have relatively narrow bandwidth. In order to overcome these limitations, circular and annular shaped <b>microstrip</b> <b>elements</b> can be used, where the resonant dimension is related to half the circumference. This leads to a more compact solution, since for the same frequency {{the size of the}} patch is smaller. Another advantage of this solution is the possibility of working with double polarization.

This unit-cell, made of two layers with reconfigurable capabilities, is based on a circular polarization selective surface (CPSS) and on a single polarization cell. After intensive electromagnetic simulations, the unit-cell in dual-circular polarization with reconfigurable capabilities has been experimentally validated using a specific waveguide measurement. In fact, the unitcell reflects independently and simultaneously the two incidents circular polarizations for a phase resolution around 2 bits in LHCP and in RHCP.
