25|$|The {{external}} genitalia {{of a woman}} are collectively {{known as}} the vulva. This comprises the labia majora (outer labia), the labia minora (inner labia), the clitoris, the urethra, and the vagina. The labia majora extend from the <b>mons</b> <b>pubis</b> to the perineum.|$|E
25|$|Pubic hair {{patterns}} {{can vary}} {{by race and}} ethnicity. Patterns of pubic hair, known as the escutcheon, vary between sexes. On most women, the pubic patch is triangular and lies over the vulva and <b>mons</b> <b>pubis.</b> On many men, the pubic patch tapers upwards to a line of hair pointing towards the navel (see abdominal hair), roughly a more upward-pointing triangle. As with axillary (armpit) hair, pubic hair {{is associated with a}} concentration of sebaceous glands in the area.|$|E
25|$|The {{clitoris}} additionally {{plays a part}} in vaginal stimulation, {{as it is a}} sex {{organ of}} multiplanar structure containing an abundance of nerve endings, with a broad attachment to the pubic arch and extensive supporting tissue to the <b>mons</b> <b>pubis</b> and labia; it is centrally attached to the urethra, and research indicates that it forms a tissue cluster with the vagina. This tissue is perhaps more extensive in some women than in others, which may contribute to orgasms experienced vaginally.|$|E
40|$|Background: Extramammary Paget’s disease (EMPD) {{remains a}} rare {{condition}} {{with only a}} limited number of cases reported in the literature. EMPD is mainly composed of intraepidermal Paget cells, and possesses variable clinical behaviors and histological appearances, leading to difficulty in the diagnosis of this disease. Case presentation: We here report a case of primary EMPD with the appearance of a nodule on the background of erythema. Histological assessment showed Paget cell infiltration throughout the epidermis with dermal spread. Using immunohistochemistry, the expressions of CK 7, CK 19, CK 20, GCDFP- 15, CEA, S- 100 protein and bcl- 2 were examined to elucidate the cellular differentiation of the carcinoma. Conclusion: According to the histological assessment, this case was diagnosed as primary EMPD with carcinoma cells invading into the dermis, but without lymph node infiltration. Background EMPD of the vulva is a rare intraepithelial adenocarcinoma which accounts for less than 1 % of carcinomas in vulva, while the majority of the patients are postmenopausal Caucasian females[1 - 3]. The cancer cells in the neoplasm usually stay “in situ ” and only rarely invade into the dermis to be metastatic via the lymphatic system [4, 5]. One has to differentiate neoplasms with Paget phenomenon from carcinomas metastasized from adjacent organs such as the urinary system and rectum [6]. Here, we present an unusual case of EMPD with carcinoma cells invading into the dermis without lymph node infiltration in a Chinese woman. Case presentation A 66 -year-old Chinese woman presented with a slowly growing vulvar mass with pruritus. Two years prior to presentation, she noted a painless red firm nodule on her vulva. Subsequently, erythema around the nodule appeared. The nodule and erythema had gradually enlarged during the 2 -year period. Physical examination revealed a 2 cm × 2 cm × 2 cm slightly erosive, nodular red firm mass on the centre of 5 cm × 7 cm area of irregular eczematoid erythema covering her <b>mons</b> <b>pubi...</b>|$|R

500|$|One of {{the first}} ideas Assis had for the film was to show the <b>mons</b> <b>pubis</b> of a {{waitress}} he knew.

50|$|The {{size of the}} <b>mons</b> <b>pubis</b> {{varies with}} the level of hormone and body fat and tends to be larger for women. After puberty, it {{generally}} becomes covered with pubic hair and enlarged. The fatty tissue of the <b>mons</b> <b>pubis</b> is sensitive to estrogen, causing a distinct mound to form with the onset of puberty. This pushes the forward portion of the labia majora out and away from the pubic bone. Likewise, the <b>mons</b> <b>pubis</b> often becomes less prominent with the decrease in bodily estrogen experienced during menopause.|$|E

5000|$|In human anatomy, and in mammals in general, the <b>mons</b> <b>pubis</b> (also known {{simply as}} the mons, and known {{specifically}} in females as the mons Venus or mons veneris), is a rounded mass of fatty tissue found over the pubic symphysis of the pubic bones. For women and girls, the <b>mons</b> <b>pubis</b> forms the anterior portion of the vulva. It divides into the labia majora (literally [...] "larger lips"), {{on either side of}} the furrow known as the pudendal cleft, that surrounds the labia minora, clitoris, urethra, vaginal opening, and other structures of the vulval vestibule.|$|E
50|$|The uterine horns are {{the points}} where the uterus and the fallopian tubes meet. They {{are one of}} the points of {{attachment}} for the round ligament of uterus (the other being the <b>mons</b> <b>pubis).</b>|$|E
50|$|The labia majora (singular: labium majus) are two {{prominent}} longitudinal cutaneous folds that extend downward and backward from the <b>mons</b> <b>pubis</b> to the perineum. Together with the labia minora they form the labia of the vulva.|$|E

50|$|The {{external}} genitalia {{of a woman}} are collectively {{known as}} the vulva. This comprises the labia majora (outer labia), the labia minora (inner labia), the clitoris, the urethra, and the vagina. The labia majora extend from the <b>mons</b> <b>pubis</b> to the perineum.|$|E
50|$|The main {{structures}} of the vulva are: the <b>mons</b> <b>pubis,</b> the labia (majora and minora) including the frenulum of labia minora, the external part of the clitoris (hood, glans), the urinary meatus, the vaginal opening and hymen, and the greater and lesser vestibular glands.|$|E
5000|$|In the female, {{they become}} the {{posterior}} labial commissure. The sides of the genital tubercle grow backward as the genital swellings, which ultimately form the labia majora; the tubercle itself becomes the <b>mons</b> <b>pubis.</b> In contrast, the labia minora are formed by the urogenital folds.|$|E
50|$|The genital branch {{passes through}} the deep {{inguinal}} ring and enters the inguinal canal. In men, the genital branch supplies the cremaster and scrotal skin. In women, the genital branch accompanies the round ligament of uterus, terminating in and innervating {{the skin of the}} <b>mons</b> <b>pubis</b> and labia majora.|$|E
50|$|The round {{ligament}} of {{the uterus}} originates at the uterine horns, in the parametrium. The round ligament enters the pelvis via the deep inguinal ring, passes through the inguinal canal and continues on to the labia majora where its fibers spread and mix with the tissue of the <b>mons</b> <b>pubis.</b>|$|E
50|$|The genital {{branch of}} the genitofemoral nerve, {{also known as the}} {{external}} spermatic nerve in males, is a nerve in the abdomen that arises from the genitofemoral nerve. The genital branch supplies the cremaster muscle and anterior scrotal skin in males, and the skin of the <b>mons</b> <b>pubis</b> and labia majora in females.|$|E
50|$|During menopause, {{hormone levels}} decrease, and as this process happens, {{reproductive}} tissues which {{are sensitive to}} these hormones shrink in size.The <b>mons</b> <b>pubis,</b> labia, and clitoris are reduced in size in post-menopause, although not usually to pre-puberty proportions.This is a condition called vulval atrophy and the decrease in estrogen can cause pale, itchy or sore skin.|$|E
50|$|The pudendal cleft (also {{called the}} cleft of Venus, pudendal fissure, pudendal cleavage, pudendal slit, {{urogenital}} cleft, vulvar slit, rima vulvae, or rima pudendi) {{is a part}} of the vulva, the furrow at the base of the <b>mons</b> <b>pubis</b> where it divides to form the labia majora. The name cleft of Venus is a reference to the Roman goddess of love, Venus.|$|E
50|$|The {{onset of}} puberty {{produces}} {{a number of}} changes. The structures of the vulva become proportionately larger and may become more pronounced. Coloration may change and pubic hair develops, first on the labia majora, and later spreading to the <b>mons</b> <b>pubis,</b> and sometimes the inner thighs and perineum. The labia minora may grow more prominent and undergo changes in color.|$|E
50|$|The genitofemoral nerve {{refers to}} a human nerve that {{is found in the}} abdomen. Its branches, the genital branch and femoral branch supply {{sensation}} to the upper anterior thigh, as well as the skin of the anterior scrotum in males and <b>mons</b> <b>pubis</b> in females. The femoral branch is different from the femoral nerve, which also arises from the lumbar plexus.|$|E
50|$|The {{suspensory}} ligament of clitoris consistently displayed two components: a superficial fibro-fatty structure extending {{from a broad}} base within the <b>mons</b> <b>pubis</b> to converge {{on the body of}} the clitoris and extending into the labia majora: in addition there is a deep component with a narrow origin on the symphysis pubis extending to the body and the bulbs of the clitoris.|$|E

50|$|In preadolescent girls, the vulva {{appears to}} be {{positioned}} further forward than in adults, showing {{a larger percentage of}} the labia majora and pudendal cleft when standing. During puberty the <b>mons</b> <b>pubis</b> enlarges, pushing the forward portion of the labia majora away from the pubic bone, and parallel to the ground (when standing). Variations in body fat levels affect the extent to which this occurs.|$|E
