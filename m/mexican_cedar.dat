50|$|Takalik Abaj {{is located}} in the north of the {{municipality}} of El Asintal, in the extreme north of Retalhuleu department, some 120 mi from Guatemala City. The site lies among five coffee plantations in the lower foothills of the Sierra Madre mountains; the Santa Margarita, San Isidro Piedra Parada, Buenos Aires, San Elías and Dolores plantations. Takalik Abaj sits upon a ridge running north-south, descending in a southwards direction. This ridge is bordered on the west by the Nimá River and on the east by the Ixchayá River, both flowing down from the Guatemalan Highlands. The Ixchayá flows in a deep ravine but a suitable crossing point is located near to the site. The situation of Takalik Abaj at this crossing point was probably important in the founding of the city, since this channeled important trade routes through the site and controlled access to them.Takalik Abaj sits at an altitude of approximately 600 m above sea level in an ecoregion classed as subtropical moist forest. The temperature normally varies between 21 and 25 C and the potential evapotranspiration ratio averages 0.45. The area receives high annual rainfall, varying between 2136 and 4372 mm, with an average annual rainfall of 3284 mm. Local vegetation includes the Pascua de Montaña (Pogonopus speciosus), Chichique (Aspidosperma megalocarpon), Tepecaulote (Luehea speciosa), Caulote or West Indian Elm (Guazuma ulmifolia), Hormigo (Platymiscium dimorphandrum), <b>Mexican</b> <b>Cedar</b> (Cedrela odorata), Breadnut (Brosimum alicastrum), Tamarind (Tamarindus indica) and Papaturria (Coccoloba montana).|$|E

2500|$|A small {{habitat in}} the state is the Huasteca {{highland}} rainforest. It has plants blooming nearly year-round. Forests include tree species such as: “Tlacuilo,” [...] Oaks (Quercus species), Copaifera, “Zuchiate,” Mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), and <b>Mexican</b> white <b>cedar</b> (Cupressus lusitanica). The area {{has one of the}} widest varieties of wild birds including eagles, hummingbirds, and wild turkeys. Reptiles include a wide variety of snakes, and mammals include coyotes, bobcats, wild boar, spotted deer, and rabbits. Tropical crops raised here include sugar cane, coconuts, pineapple, bananas, mamey, and tamarind.|$|R
5000|$|The {{eastern part}} of the country, La Mosquitia, has many plants trepadoras or enredaderas, like the lianes and many epifitas, most strikingly the orchids. Adapted to the humid environment, trees are {{enormous}} and do not possess deep roots sustaining thanks to the big spurs, while the leaves are large and many. The tree trunks are straight and smooth and their first branches are high above the forest floor. The rainforest corresponds to parts of the northern region below 600 meters in elevation; there is not dry station entirely clear-cut and covers 29% of the total of the surface of the country. Among the more typical vegetal species in this region biogeográfica: Real <b>cedar</b> (Cedrela <b>Mexican),</b> Common <b>Cedar</b> (Cedrela odorata), mahogany (Swetonia mahogoni L.), tree of María (Calophyllum brasiliense), Cortés (Tabebuia guayacan), [...] "Espavel" [...] or Mijao (Anacardium excelsum), guayabo (Guayabón) or (Tarminalia amazonia).|$|R
5000|$|The churchyard forms {{a privileged}} lookout over the Tower of Belém and the {{northern}} margin of the Tagus River. In front of the tower, to the southwest, is a small plateau slightly inclined towards the west, forming a greenspace delimited by a [...] "U"-shaped area and the roadway. The green, approximately 1 m below the elevation of the chapel, is separated from the churchyard by a small wall, {{with the exception of}} the space immediately in front of the hermitage. This area is delimited by forest planted in levels, descending towards the flanks of Restelo, until Rua de Alcolena. There is a general preoccupation with the distribution of the vegetation, strategically placed to allow views and privileged visual accesses to the river and Belem Tower. While eastern flanks are predominated by European olive trees (Olea europaea), while the introduction of species such as the Mediterranean Cypress (Cupressus sempervirens), the <b>Mexican</b> White <b>Cedar</b> (Cupressus lusitanica), th Lebanese cedar (Cedrus libani) and the Stone pine (Pinus pinea) dominate the eastern flanks. A stone staircase with various flights (in the Ducla Soares garden across from the Rua de Alcolena), connects the hermitage's first terrace to the Avenida do Restelo. This connection, which falls between the Tower of Belém and hermitage, is more evident along Avenida da Torre de Belém between May and summer, due to the patchwork of flowering trees, with a line of deep blue lilacs.|$|R
