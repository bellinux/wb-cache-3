He said that he [...] "wrote the song {{as a gift for}} my mom in a Mother's Day and two sisters (a couple of years ago) [...] and i thought the idea of {{including}} it on the album was very good". Lyrically, [...] "Mi Novia Se Me Esta Poniendo Vieja" [...] revolves around how a son looks at their mother from a sentimental perspective, with Arjona singing [...] "She loves <b>me</b> <b>either</b> if i gor as a guerrilla, or I won the Nobel Prize for Peace / She does't care if i'm last or first, if i'm going as a conformist or as tenacious." [...] He also said that he never thought to include the song in an album, just as happened with his single [...] "Señora De Las Cuatro Decadas" [...] from Historias back in 1994.|$|E
500|$|Two {{weeks later}} in the Super Bowl, the Falcons played the Broncos, the game pitting coach Dan Reeves against his former team and their star quarterback, John Elway. Reeves had led the Broncos to three Super Bowl appearances, all losses, and he was fired as the Broncos' head coach after the 1992 NFL season. Afterward, Elway was quoted as saying, [...] "These last three years have been hell. I know I {{would not have been}} back here if Dan Reeves had been here. It wasn't worth it to me. I didn't enjoy it. It wasn't any fun, and I got tired of working with him." [...] Reeves responded by saying, [...] "Just tell him it wasn't exactly heaven for <b>me</b> <b>either.</b> One of these days I hope he grows up. Maybe he'll mature sometime." [...] During his tenure, Reeves had also fired Shanahan, who was an {{assistant}} coach on the team, and these points of contention became a media storyline entering the game. Nonetheless, all parties involved stated that any lingering animosity had long since passed.|$|E

2500|$|Mozart's string quartets are {{considered}} the pinnacle of the classical art. The six string quartets that he dedicated to Haydn, his friend and mentor, inspired the elder composer to say to Mozart's father, [...] "I tell you before God as an honest man that your son is the greatest composer known to <b>me</b> <b>either</b> in person or by reputation.

[...] He then did leave Meher Baba. The money he {{referred}} to was money he had spent hosting Meher Baba at his retreat in Devon. Starr disbanded the Devon retreat and sold the property {{a year and a}} half later. He later organized 'nature cure and scientific relaxation' courses at Frogmore Hall, Herts.|$|E

Ponting was promoted to captain in the 2011–12 Commonwealth Bank Series in Australia in Michael Clarke's absence due to injury. However, after only two games as captain he was dropped, having scored only 18 runs in 5 games of the 2011–12 Commonwealth Bank Series. At a press conference thereafter, Ponting conceded, [...] "I don't expect to play one-day international cricket for Australia any more and I'm pretty sure the selectors don't expect to pick <b>me</b> <b>either...</b> I will continue playing Test cricket and I'll continue playing for Tasmania as well".|$|E

2500|$|In 1785 Leopold visited Wolfgang and Constanze in Vienna, at a {{time when}} his son's career success was at its peak. He {{witnessed}} first hand his son's success as a performer, and on February 12 heard Joseph Haydn's widely quoted words of praise, upon hearing the string quartets Wolfgang dedicated to him, [...] "Before God and as an honest man I tell you that your son is the greatest composer known to <b>me</b> <b>either</b> in person or by name: He has taste, and, furthermore, the most profound knowledge of composition." [...] The visit was the last time that Leopold saw his son, though they continued to correspond, and Wolfgang sometimes sent copies of his piano concertos and string quartets for Leopold and Nannerl to perform with friends.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, {{two years}} before the December Revolution toppled communism, Rusz decided to leave Romania for West Germany. This gesture was a {{consequence}} of nationalist and national communist policies adopted by the regime of Nicolae Ceauşescu and specifically targeting some of Romania's ethnic minorities. According to writer György Györfi-Deák, Ceauşescu [...] "gave a hard time to the Hungarians", and Rusz personally was [...] "harassed by the dictator's politruks and Securitate men". After a short stay in Germany, Rusz settled in Budapest, Hungary, where she owns a villa. She continued her activity, becoming a noted contributor to the Hungarian comic school (with albums such as Miskati közbelép, [...] "Miskati Intervenes"). The change was described by the artist herself as a difficult one: [...] "Even plants will suffer when moved from one pot to another; it was not easy for <b>me</b> <b>either</b> to build up my new roots, but as long as forces permit me and I can still work it means I am alive." ...|$|E

This pains my heart within me, because wrongs between humans and their fellow are not atoned by Yom Kippur, until the wronged one is appeased.

Therefore I {{prostrate}} and beg before You, to have mercy on me, and grant me grace, compassion, and mercy in Your eyes and in the eyes of all people. For behold, I forgive with a final and resolved forgiveness anyone who has wronged me, whether in person or property, even if they slandered me, or spread falsehoods against me. So I release anyone who has injured <b>me</b> <b>either</b> in person or in property, or has committed any manner of sin that one may commit against another [...] Except for these two, I fully and finally forgive everyone; may no one be punished because of me.

2500|$|The film drew {{praise from}} critics in Spain, {{including}} La Vanguardia, who compared Julieta to the female-centric films of George Cukor and Kenji Mizoguchi while noting hints of Alfred Hitchcock in Almodóvar's screenplay. Alfonso Rivera of Cineuropa additionally observed influences of Ingmar Bergman, Krzysztof Kieślowski and Douglas Sirk in Almodóvar's style. Vicente Molina Fox from El País believed Almodóvar had achieved the best script {{of his career}} with Julieta, while Luis Martínez of El Mundo, despite finding issues with the narrative, thought Julieta was Almodóvar's [...] "most difficult and most pure film". Spanish edition of Vanity Fair also called it [...] "the most Almodóvar film by Almodóvar". Quim Casas from El Periódico de Catalunya said that Almodóvar had reinvented melodrama: [...] "Prodigious in dramatic tone, Julieta is very Almodóvarian {{but at the same}} time different to other works by the auteur". ABC gave the film a mixed review; praising Suárez in the lead role but criticising narrative choices. , the [...] "sworn critical enemy" [...] of Almodóvar, penned an extremely negative review in El País, feeling distanced and unable to identify with the characters because of the film's style and cinematography. Boyero stated that [...] "the film conveys nothing to <b>me,</b> <b>either</b> emotionally or artistically". El Confidencial also responded negatively, calling the film [...] "a barren drama", [...] "unsubtle" [...] and [...] "self-indulgent".|$|E
2500|$|The two actual {{founders of}} the Bond party were a German man named Borckenhagen who lived in Bloemfontein, and an Afrikaner named Reitz, who {{afterwards}} became the state secretary of the Transvaal. There are two recorded interview that show the true aims of the {{founders of the}} Bond from the very beginning. One occurred between Borckenhagen and Cecil Rhodes, the other between Reitz and T. Schreiner, whose brother later became prime minister of Cape Colony. In the first interview, Borckenhagen remarked to Rhodes: [...] "We want a united Africa," [...] and Rhodes replied: [...] "So do I". Mr Borckenhagen then continued: [...] "There is nothing in the way; we will take you as our leader. There is only one small thing: we must, of course, be independent of the rest of the world." [...] Rhodes replied: [...] "You take <b>me</b> <b>either</b> for a rogue or a fool. I should be a rogue to forfeit all my history and my traditions; and I should be a fool, because I should be hated by my own countrymen and mistrusted by yours." [...] But as Rhodes said in Cape Town in 1898, [...] "the only chance of a true union is the overshadowing protection of a supreme power, and any German, Frenchman, or Russian would tell you that the best and most liberal power is that over which Her Majesty reigns." ...|$|E
