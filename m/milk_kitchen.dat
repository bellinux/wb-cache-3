Serving as president, the association saw success, and soon expanded across most of Upper Palatinate in just three years.

40|$|Milk may {{represent}} {{an important source}} of infectious agents to hospitalized pediatric patients. To describe the bacterial microflora isolated from the hands, stools, pharynx of all workers at <b>milk</b> <b>kitchens</b> in pediatric hospitals in the city of Salvador, Brazil, {{as well as in the}} formulas prepared by them, we carried out this cross-sectional study with all 91 workers from the 20 <b>milk</b> <b>kitchens</b> of all the public and private hospitals in Salvador, Brazil. Hand and pharynx swabs and stool samples were collected from all workers, as well as samples of the milk and formulas delivered by the kitchens. All samples were cultured for the detection of pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria. Pathogenic bacteria were isolated from 20 (22. 0 %) and 8 (8. 8 %) cultures of the hands and pharynx of the workers, respectively. No pathogenic bacteria were isolated from stool samples. Pathogenic bacteria were isolated from 17 (18. 7 %) milk samples. The prevalence of pathogenic bacteria in hand swabs was significantly higher in workers from public (37. 8 %) than from private (6. 5 %) hospitals (prevalence ratio [PR]= 5. 8; p< 0. 01). Pathogenic bacteria were isolated from two (4. 4 %) workers from public hospitals and six (13. 0 %) workers from private hospitals (PR= 0. 38; p= 0. 27).

40|$|This {{study was}} the first {{conducted}} in Brazil to evaluate the presence of Enterobacter sakazakii in milk-based powdered infant formula manufactured for infants 0 to 6 months of age and to examine the conditions of formula preparation and service in three hospitals in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Samples of dried and rehydrated infant formula, environments of <b>milk</b> <b>kitchens,</b> water, bottles and nipples, utensils, and hands of personnel were analyzed, and E. sakazakii and Enterobacteriaceae populations were determined. All samples of powdered infant formula purchased at retail contained E. sakazakii at < 0. 03 most probable number (MPN) / 100 g. In hospital samples, E. sakazakii was found in one unopened formula can (0. 3 MPN/ 100 g) and in the residue from one nursing bottle from hospital A. All other cans of formula from the same lot bought at a retail store contained E. sakazakii at < 0. 03 MPN/ 100 g. The pathogen also was found in one cleaning sponge from hospital B. Enterobacteriaceae populations ranged from 10 (1) to 10 (5) CFU/g in cleaning aids and < 5 CFU/g in all formula types (dry or rehydrated), except for the sample that contained E. sakazakii, which also was contaminated with Enterobacteriaceae at 5 CFU/g. E. sakazakii isolates were not genetically related. In an experiment in which rehydrated formula {{was used as the}} growth medium, the temperature was that of the neonatal intensive care unit (25 C), and the incubation time was the average time that formula is left at room temperature while feeding the babies (up to 4 h), a 2 -log increase in levels of E. sakazakii was found in the formula. Visual inspection of the facilities revealed that the hygienic conditions in the <b>milk</b> <b>kitchens</b> needed improvement. The length of time that formula is left at room temperature in the different hospitals while the babies in the neonatal intensive care unit are being fed (up to 4 h) may allow for the multiplication of E. sakazakii and thus may lead to an increased health risk for infants.

In 1923 the Hygiene Institute was founded in Ljubljana, and until the Second World War were formed over 20 health centers and associated dispensaries (antituberculotic, antisyphilitic and in Prekmurje antititrahomic) in Dravska banovina. The Hygiene Institute had the following specialized departments: bacteriological and epidemiological, social-medical, chemical, sanitary-technicaland laboratories.

40|$|MUCH {{suggests}} that hormones play a complex {{role in the}} pathogenesis of mammary tumours. In a closed colony of rats kept at the Gynaecological Department, University Hospital, Lund, tumours often occur spontaneously in the mammae of the older animals. It was therefore decided to study the animals systematically for tumours in endocrine organs (pituitary, adrenals and gonads), which might have some relation to mammary tumours. Since castration and treatment with oestrogen or progesterone are known to affect the development of mammary tumours in rats (Geschickter, 1947; Burrows and Horning, 1952), the influence of such measures was also studied. Roentgen irradiation, which has a carcinogenic effect, was {{also included in the}} investigation. MATERIAL AND METHODS Virginal female rats and male rats that had since birth been kept separate from females, were observed, generally until their natural death (occasionally some of the animals were killed to provide material for histological examination). All the animals were raised alike in cages of the same size and on a diet of grain, <b>milk</b> and <b>kitchen</b> refuse. Some male and female animals were gonadectomised at 3 weeks of age. Two groups of spayed females received injections of either oestrogen (1. 25 mg. oestradiolbenzoate in 0. 25 c. c. oil) or progesterone (12. 5 mg. progesterone in 0. 25 c. c. oil) once a week from the age of 1 to 12 months. A single X-ray dose over the whole body was given to some animals-intact and spayed females-when they were 3 weeks old. When combined with spaying the dose was given on the day after the operation. The "air dose " given was 300 r (filter 1 mm. A 1, mm. Cu; distance 50 cm., exposure time 3. 9 minutes). The animals were examined post mortem for any tumours.

40|$|Abstract Background Food {{handlers}} have a {{very important}} role in preventing food contamination during its preparation and distribution. This responsibility is even greater in hospitals, since a large number of patients have low immunity and consequently food contamination by pathogenic bacteria could be particularly harmful. Therefore, a good working environment and periodic training should be provided to food handlers by upper management. Methods This study is qualitative research by means of focus group and thematic content analysis methodologies to examine, in detail, the statements by food handlers working in the <b>milk</b> and specific-diet <b>kitchens</b> in a hospital to understand the problems they face in the workplace. Results We found that food handlers are aware of the role they play in restoring patients' health; they consider it important to offer a good-quality diet. However, according to their perceptions, a number of difficulties prevent them from reaching this aim. These include: upper management not prioritizing human and material resources to the dietetic services when making resource allocation decisions; a perception that upper management considers their work to be of lesser importance; delayed overtime payments; lack of periodic training; managers lacking administrative skills; insufficient dietitian staff assistants, leading to overwork, {{at the same time as}} there is an excess of dietitians; unhealthy environmental working conditions – high temperature, high humidity, loud and constant noise level, poor ventilation; lack of food, and kitchen utensils and equipment; and relationship conflicts with chief dieticians and co-workers. Conclusion From these findings, improvement in staff motivation could be achieved by considering non-financial incentives, such as improvement in working conditions and showing appreciation and respect through supervision, training and performance appraisal. Management action, such as investments in intermediary management so that managers have the capacity to provide supportive supervision, as well as better use of performance appraisal and access to training, may help overcome the identified problems. </p...|$|R
