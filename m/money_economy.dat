The annual poll tax rate for adult men and women was 120 coins and 20 coins for minors. Merchants were required to pay a higher rate of 240 coins. The poll tax stimulated a <b>money</b> <b>economy</b> that necessitated the minting of over 28,000,000,000 coins from 118 BC to 5 AD, an average of 220,000,000 coins a year.|$|E

The coinage issued by the central government mint in 119 BC remained the standard coinage of China until the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD). The period saw a number of limited institutional innovations. To pay for its military campaigns and the settlement of newly conquered frontier territories, the government nationalized the private salt and iron industries in 117 BC, but these government monopolies were repealed during the Eastern Han period. Science and technology during the Han period saw significant advances, including papermaking, the nautical steering rudder, the use of negative numbers in mathematics, the raised-relief map, the hydraulic-powered armillary sphere for astronomy, and a seismometer employing an inverted pendulum.|$|E

40|$|Inside debt is a {{fundamental}} feature of capitalist economies. This paper examines the growth effects of consumer and corporate debt using a Cambridge - Kaleckian growth framework. According to the Cambridge - Kaleckian model inside debt has an ambiguous effect on growth. This is counter to the intuition of static short-run macro models in which higher debt levels lower economic activity and shows intuitions derived from short run macroeconomics do not always carry over to growth theory. Growth is faster in endogenous <b>money</b> <b>economies</b> than in pure credit economies, ceteris paribus. That is because lending in endogenous <b>money</b> <b>economies</b> creates <b>money</b> wealth that increases spending and lowers saving. Interest payments from debtors to creditors are a critical channel whereby debt affects growth. In the consumer debt model this interest transfer mechanism exerts a negative influence on growth. However, in the corporate debt model the transfer can raise growth if the marginal propensity to consume of creditor households exceeds the marginal propensity to invest of firms.

25|$|Of all the {{countries}} in Southern and Central Africa, Nyasaland was notorious {{for the duration of}} thangata and its importance to the colonial economy. Labour tenancy and sharecropping continued to exist in other less developed parts of Southern and Central Africa in the 20th century, but without the same social and political impact as in Nyasaland. In much of South Africa and Southern and North-Western Rhodesia, the growth of the <b>money</b> <b>economy</b> led rapidly to waged employment rather than labour in lieu of rent, and in North-Eastern Rhodesia estate agriculture was less dominant and land reasonably plentiful. In early Natal, the shortage of capital caused landowners to extract rent from African tenants in the forms of produce or labour, and this applied in Zululand until the early 20th century. However, in central Natal, employment for wages took over in the last third of the 19th century. African tenant farmers on European-owned estates in Matabeleland in the early colonial period could either pay rent or provide labour in lieu of rent, but after 1910, it was more usual to employ Africans for wages.|$|E

500|$|During the Warring States period (403–221 BC), the {{development}} of private commerce, new trade routes, handicraft industries, and a <b>money</b> <b>economy</b> led {{to the growth of}} new urban centers. These centers were markedly different from the older cities, which had merely served as power bases for the nobility. The use of a standardized, nationwide currency during the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) facilitated long-distance trade between cities. Many Han cities grew large: the Western Han capital, Chang'an, had approximately 250,000 inhabitants, while the Eastern Han capital, Luoyang, had approximately 500,000 inhabitants. The population of the Han Empire, recorded in the tax census of 2 AD, was 57.6 million people in 12,366,470 households. The majority of commoners who populated the cities lived in extended urban and suburban areas outside the city walls and gatehouses. The total urban area of Western-Han Chang'an—including the extensions outside the walls—was [...] The total urban area of Eastern-Han Luoyang—including the extensions outside the walls—was [...] Both Chang'an and Luoyang had two prominent marketplaces; each market had a two-story government office demarcated by a flag and drum at the top.

500|$|Although {{these natural}} calamities and rebellions stained the {{reputation}} and hampered {{the effectiveness of}} the central government, the early 9th century is nonetheless viewed as a period of recovery for the Tang dynasty. The government's withdrawal from its role in managing the economy had the unintended effect of stimulating trade, as more markets with less bureaucratic restrictions were opened up. By 780, the old grain tax and labor service of the 7th century was replaced by a semiannual tax paid in cash, signifying the shift to a <b>money</b> <b>economy</b> boosted by the merchant class. Cities in the Jiangnan region to the south, such as Yangzhou, Suzhou, and Hangzhou prospered the most economically during the late Tang period. The government monopoly on the production of salt, weakened after the An Shi Rebellion, was placed under the Salt Commission, which {{became one of the most}} powerful state agencies, run by capable ministers chosen as specialists. The commission began the practice of selling merchants the rights to buy monopoly salt, which they would then transport and sell in local markets. In 799 salt accounted for over half of the government's revenues. S. A. M. Adshead writes that this salt tax represents [...] "the first time that an indirect tax, rather than tribute, levies on land or people, or profit from state enterprises such as mines, had been the primary resource of a major state." [...] Even after the power of the central government was in decline after the mid 8th century, it was still able to function and give out imperial orders on a massive scale.

2500|$|The Welsh of Gwynedd {{remained}} {{conscious of}} their Romano-British heritage and an affinity with Rome survived {{long after the}} Empire retreated from Britain, particularly {{with the use of}} Latin in writing and sustaining the Christian religion.

[...] So palpable was the Roman heritage felt that Professor Bryan Ward-Perkins of Trinity College, Oxford, wrote [...] "It took until 1282, when Edward I conquered Gwynedd, for the last part of Roman Britain to fall [...] a strong case can be made for Gwynedd as the very last part of the entire Roman Empire, east and west, to fall to the barbarians." [...] Nevertheless, there was generally quick abandonment of Roman political, social, and ecclesiastical practices and institutions within Gwynedd and elsewhere in Wales.

Ward-Perkins suggests the Welsh had to abandon those Roman ways which proved insufficient, or indeed superfluous, to meet the challenge of survival they faced, [...] "Militarized tribal societies, despite their political fragmentation and internecine strife, seem to have offered better protection against Germanic invasion than exclusive dependence on a professional Roman army (that in the troubled years of the fifth century was all too prone to melt away or mutiny)." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{this is not}} yet {{the whole}} problem. If France and Italy are to make good their own {{deficiencies}} in coal from the output of Germany, then Northern Europe, Switzerland, and Austria, which previously drew their coal in large part from Germany's exportable surplus, must be starved of their supplies. Before the war 13,600,000 tons of Germany's coal exports went to Austria-Hungary. Inasmuch as nearly all the coalfields of the former Empire lie outside what is now German-Austria, the industrial ruin of this latter state, if she cannot obtain coal from Germany, will be complete. The case of Germany's neutral neighbors, who were formerly supplied in part from Great Britain but in large part from Germany, will be hardly less serious. They will {{go to great lengths}} in the direction of making their own supplies to Germany of materials which are essential to her, conditional on these being paid for in coal. Indeed they are already doing so.[49] With the breakdown of <b>money</b> <b>economy</b> the practice of international barter is becoming prevalent. Nowadays money in Central and South-Eastern Europe is seldom a true measure of value in exchange, and will not necessarily buy anything, with the consequence that one country, possessing a commodity essential to the needs of another, sells it not for cash but only against a reciprocal engagement {{on the part of the}} latter country to furnish in return some article not less necessary to the former. This is an extraordinary complication as compared with the former almost perfect simplicity of international trade. But in the no less extraordinary conditions of to-day's industry it is not without advantages as a means of stimulating production. The butter-shifts of the Ruhr[50] show how far modern Europe has retrograded in the direction of barter, and afford a picturesque illustration of the low economic organization to which the breakdown of currency and free exchange between individuals and nations is quickly leading us. But they may produce the coal where other devices would fail.[51] ...|$|E
