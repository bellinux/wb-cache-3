By 2008, the once vast estate that at its peak was home to more than 600 thoroughbreds, had devolved to just a small private farm. In November 2009, the Windfields Farm breeding operations were wound up. Its broodmares and weanlings were sent to be auctioned at the Canadian Thoroughbred Horse Society Winter <b>Mixed</b> <b>Sale</b> and its remaining bloodstock was sold at the Keeneland Sales in Lexington, Kentucky.

The design of the distribution channel is one of main decisions for manufacturers and should be determined in the early stage of the production. In this paper, two types of channel distributions are suggested for single product manufacturers. One is a direct sale, which is considered as a general tendency of the times, and the other is a <b>mixed</b> <b>sale,</b> which combines wholesale and retail sale strategies. The expected profit functions for these strategies are formulated and evaluated by different assumptions about customer demands. In particular, the customer demand function is assumed to be uniformly distributed, depending on the sales price. As a special case a linearly bounded demand distribution is further investigated. Based on these conditions, the optimal wholesale quantity and retail price are determined. In conclusion, the results indicate a channel strategy that guarantees the maximum profits based on business conditions...|$|E
40|$|Typical {{inventory}} models usually {{focus on}} screening out the deteriorating items, not much {{attention is paid}} to the situation that a proportion of deteriorated items are sold to consumers together with serviceable items during a replenishment cycle. This paper first presents a model to formulate the process of such kind of <b>mixed</b> <b>sales.</b> A simple closed-form solution is obtained for maximizing the net profit per unit time under the assumption of small deterioration rate. The effect of shortage back-ordering is then considered and closed-form solutions of optimal ordering quantity and replenishment time are obtained under similar assumption. We further study the effect of inspection policies on optimal decisions for a deteriorating inventory system. A dynamic programming approach is proposed for solving the optimal policy. Numerical examples are then provided to demonstrate our conclusions and results. Department of Applied Mathematic...|$|R
5000|$|Product {{designers}} {{were familiar}} with the IKEA effect long before it was given a name. Norton and his colleagues noted that, while not yet named or scientifically established, it had been recognized by marketers for a long time. For instance, when instant cake mixes were first marketed in the 1950s, many homemakers were resistant because the instant mixes made cooking [...] "too easy", which made their labor and skill feel [...] "undervalued." [...] Because homemakers didn't feel [...] "invested" [...] in the baking process, they put no value on the product. In response to this problem, the producers of the cake mixes made a simple change in the recipe: homemakers were required to add an egg. By adding one more step - cracking an egg - homemakers felt like they were actually baking, which resulted in increased instant cake <b>mix</b> <b>sales.</b>|$|R
