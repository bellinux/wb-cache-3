50|$|Currently, only Washington, D.C. {{does not}} have a <b>move</b> <b>over</b> law. On June 17, 2009, Connecticut Governor M.

5|$|As {{the storm}} <b>moved</b> <b>over</b> the East China Sea on September1, Agnes began to {{interact}} with a mid-latitude trough situated south of South Korea and began a prolonged extratropical transition. Increasing wind shear exposed {{the center of the}} typhoon and displaced convection to the north and east. Subsequent slowing of the cyclone's forward speed as it turned northward resulted in an extended period of heavy rain for much of South Korea. The JTWC estimated Agnes to have become predominantly extratropical by the end of September1, coinciding with the system weakening below typhoon intensity. The JMA, however, maintained the storm as a tropical system as it began moving northwest. The diminishing cyclone <b>moved</b> <b>over</b> the Korea Strait on September3 and completed its extratropical transition that afternoon. Accelerating over the Sea of Japan, the remnant storm deepened slightly before striking the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido on September4 with an estimated pressure of 976mbar (hPa; 28.82inHg). After moving over the Sea of Okhotsk, Agnes impacted the Kamchatka Peninsula of Russia on September5. The system then <b>moved</b> <b>over</b> the open waters of the North Pacific and was last noted near the International Dateline on September6.|$|E

50|$|A <b>move</b> <b>over</b> {{law is a}} {{law which}} {{requires}} motorists to <b>move</b> <b>over</b> and change lanes to give safe clearance to law enforcement officers, firefighters, ambulances, and in some cases, tow-truck drivers. In the past, Canada and United States have used this term to apply to two different concepts; however, this is beginning to change as Canadian provinces have begun expanding the scope of their <b>move</b> <b>over</b> laws.|$|R

5|$|Late on September 3, an eye {{began to}} form {{in the center of}} the deep {{convection}} as Henriette turned to the northwest. The eye became better defined the next day, and Henriette attained a peak intensity of 100mph (160km/h) as the northern portion of the eyewall <b>moved</b> <b>over</b> southern Baja California Peninsula. The hurricane quickly crossed the southern tip of Baja California Peninsula and emerged into the Pacific Ocean again as a weakened 85mph (135km/h) cyclone with disrupted convection near the center. Convection gradually waned as the hurricane <b>moved</b> <b>over</b> progressively colder waters, and on September 6 Henriette weakened to a tropical depression. The storm turned to the west, and gradually weakened until dissipating on September 8.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} September 1946, the Intertropical Convergence Zone in the Eastern Pacific moved {{north of}} its typical position. An {{associated}} weather disturbance <b>moved</b> <b>over</b> Central America and interacted with a surface low-pressure area over Guatemala. Meanwhile, a broad high-pressure area <b>moved</b> <b>over</b> the United States behind an intense storm that moved eastward into the Atlantic Ocean. Connected to the cyclone was a shear line stretching from Bermuda to the Caribbean Sea, which spawned an upper-level low over open waters. It moved westward on October 4, and {{by the next day}} it was located over the Southeastern United States. The feature over Guatemala began moving toward the northeast as the upper-level low approached and began deepening. Modern-day analysis estimates that the system became a tropical storm early on October 5, shortly after emerging into the Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} week of December, a frontal trough stalled south of Bermuda. An upper level {{disturbance}} <b>moved</b> <b>over</b> the area on December 9, and produced widespread convection along the frontal wave. The system moved to the northeast, and based on a developing circulation within the convection, the National Hurricane Center classified the system as a subtropical storm on December 12 while located 275miles (440km) northeast of Bermuda.|$|E

5|$|Late on July5, the Government of Jamaica {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} {{watch for the}} nation as Dennis intensified over the eastern Caribbean.

5|$|Later in the month, another storm {{similar to}} Bernice existed. Tropical Storm Claudia formed on September20 to the {{southwest}} of Acapulco. It maintained a general northwest movement for its duration. On September23, Claudia crossed over the western portion of the Baja California peninsula, <b>moved</b> <b>over</b> water, and again struck the peninsula before dissipating.|$|E
5|$|On August 23, {{the storm}} began a {{weakening}} trend {{and it turned}} towards the north. The next day, the storm—having weakened to Category 1 status—skirted the southeastern tip of Newfoundland. Debbie began to lose its tropical characteristics as it accelerated towards the northeast, and it weakened into a tropical storm early on August 25. As it <b>moved</b> <b>over</b> increasingly cold waters, it dissipated east of Greenland.|$|E

5|$|A band of {{convection}} formed {{northeast of}} Greg early on September7, inducing moderate to strong northeasterly wind shear on the cyclone. Combined with land interaction, the storm weakened to tropical storm intensity by 18:00UTC that day, and Greg made landfall near Cabo San Lucas three hours later, with winds of 60mph (95km/h). After turning west-northwest and then west, the cyclone <b>moved</b> <b>over</b> progressively cooler waters {{and continued to}} lose strength, although a small area of deep convection persisted. Greg weakened to a tropical depression by 18:00UTC on September8 before succumbing to the unfavorable environment and dissipating a day later west of Baja California Sur.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance formed on September 9 and became Tropical Depression Fourteen-E later that day. The cyclone moved northwest and strengthened into {{a tropical storm}} on September 10. Linda then rapidly intensified, reaching hurricane intensity the next day as an eye formed. On September 12, Linda reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of —making it a Category5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale—and a minimum pressure of 902mbar (902hPa), making it the most intense Pacific hurricane ever recorded until Hurricane Patricia surpassed it in 2015. However, Linda soon <b>moved</b> <b>over</b> cooler waters, and began to weaken, falling below hurricane intensity on September 16. It then slowly weakened and dissipated on September 17.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{developed into}} Tropical Storm Barbara over the Bahamas on August11. It intensified {{as it moved}} north-northwestward, becoming a hurricane by the next day, and reaching peak winds of 90mph (150km/h) just south of Cape Hatteras on August13. Barbara <b>moved</b> <b>over</b> the Outer Banks, passing between Morehead City and Ocracoke, and it turned and accelerated to the northeast. Steadily weakening and losing tropical characteristics, the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone late on August15. It turned northward, crossing eastern Nova Scotia and dissipating over Labrador on August16.|$|E
