40|$|Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is {{the most}} {{frequently}} diagnosed form of dementia resulting in cognitive impairment. Many AD mouse studies, using the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), report improved cognitive ability, but conflicting results between and within studies currently exist. To address this, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of SAM on cognitive ability as measured by Y maze performance. As supporting evidence, we include further discussion of improvements in cognitive ability, by SAM, {{as measured by the}} Morris water maze (MWM). Methods:We conducted a comprehensive literature review up to April 2014 based on searches querying MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library and Proquest Theses and Dissertation databases. We identified three studies containing a total of 12 experiments that met our inclusion criteria and one study for qualitative review. The data from these studies were used to evaluate the effect of SAM on cognitive performance according to two scenarios: 1. SAM supplemented folate deficient (SFD) diet compared to a folate deficient (FD) diet and 2. SFD diet compared to a nutrient complete (NC) diet. Hedge’s g was used to calculate effect sizes and mixed effects model meta-regression was used to evaluate moderating factors. Results: Our findings showed that the SFD diet was associated with improvements in cognitive performance. SFD diet mice also had superior cognitive performance compared to mice on an NC diet.

The protocol details of our meta-analysis have been submitted to the PROSPERO register and our registration number is CRD 42013004157. Results: Nine studies {{were included in the}} present meta-analyses. The results showed that the FMD level was significantly increased in the initial 120 min after intake of grape polyphenols as compared with controls. <b>Meta-regression</b> and subgroup <b>analyses</b> were performed and showed that a health status was the main effect modifier of the significant heterogeneity. Subgroups indicated that intake of grape polyphenols could significantly increase FMD in healthy subjects, and the increased FMD appeared to be more obviously in subjects with high cardiovascular risk factors. Moreover, the peak effect of grape polyphenols on FMD in healthy subjects was found 30 min after ingestion, which was different from the effect in subjects with high cardiovascular risk factors, in whom the peak effect was found 60 min after ingestion.

40|$|Background: In meta-analyses of {{clinical}} trials, clinicians are often interested in examining subset effects. Meta-regression of aggregated data is a usual approach for relating sources {{of variation in}} treatment effects to specific study characteristics. However, {{it is known that}} study-level analyses can lead to biased assessments and have some limitations in explaining the hetero-geneity. An individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis offers several advantages for this purpose. Methods: We compared some regression analyses of IPD with <b>meta-regression</b> <b>analyses</b> of the summarized data using a real-world example in order to investigate whether a binary patient characteristic is related to treatment effect. We used data from 10 randomized trials for non-small-cell lung cancer (n = 1355). Results: For treatment · stage interaction in IPD regression analysis, none of the tests of inter-actionswas statistically significant. Themeta-regression analysis gave a greaterP-value than the IPDanalysis. Whenexcluding twostudies,whichhadonly stage Ipatients, the interactionwasalso not statistically significant in IPD analysis. On the other hand, the result of meta-regression analysis, though also showing no significant relationship, revealed a clear reversal in the direction of effect. Conclusion:We suggest that the results of <b>meta-regression</b> <b>analyses</b> would not be as robust as those of regression analyses using IPD in examining potential modifiers of treatment effects. To investigate whether patient characteristics are related to treatment effects, we suggest that interaction tests and sensitivity analyses using IPD should be employed whenever possible.

40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} {{the efficacy of}} probiotic supplementation on intestinal transit time (ITT) and to identify factors that influence these outcomes. METHODS: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of probiotic supplementation that measured ITT in adults was conducted by searching MEDLINE and EMBASE using relevant key word combinations. Main search limits included RCTs of probiotic supplementation in healthy or constipated adults that measured ITT. Study quality was assessed using the Jadad scale. A random effects meta-analysis was performed with standardized mean difference (SMD) of ITT between probiotic and control groups as the primary outcome. <b>Meta-regression</b> and subgroup <b>analyses</b> were conducted to {{examine the impact of}} moderator variables on ITT SMD. RESULTS: A total of 11 clinical trials with 13 treatment effects representing 464 subjects were included in this analysis. Probiotic supplementation was associated with decreased ITT in relation to controls, with an SMD of 0. 40 (95 %CI: 0. 20 - 0. 59, P < 0. 001). Constipation (r 2 = 39 %, P = 0. 01), higher mean age (r 2 = 27 %, P = 0. 03), and higher percentage of female subjects (r 2 = 23 %, P < 0. 05) were predictive of decreased ITT with probiotics in <b>meta-regression.</b> Subgroup <b>analyses</b> demonstrated statistically greater reductions in ITT with probiotics in subjects with vs without constipation and in older vs younger subjects [both SMD: 0. 59 (95 %CI: 0. 39 - 0. 79) vs 0. 17 (95 %CI: - 0. 08 - 0. 42), P = 0. 01].

It is unknown to what extent these associations vary by population, age, sex, body mass index, and cigarette smoking, or whether duration and frequency of symptoms interact in predicting risk. The Barrett's and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Consortium (BEACON) allowed an in-depth assessment of these issues. Detailed information on heartburn and regurgitation symptoms and covariates were available from five BEACON case-control studies of EA and esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma (EGJA). We conducted single-study multivariable logistic regressions followed by random-effects meta-analysis. Stratified <b>analyses,</b> <b>meta-regressions,</b> and sensitivity <b>analyses</b> were also conducted. Five studies provided 1, 128 EA cases, 1, 229 EGJA cases, and 4, 057 controls for analysis. All summary estimates indicated positive, significant associations between heartburn/regurgitation symptoms and EA. Increasing heartburn duration was associated with increasing EA risk; odds ratios were 2. 80, 3. 85, and 6. 24 for symptom durations of < 10 years, 10 to < 20 years, and ≥ 20 years. Associations with EGJA were slighter weaker, but still statistically significant for those with the highest exposure. Both frequency and duration of heartburn/regurgitation symptoms were independently associated with higher risk. We observed similar strengths of associations when stratified by age, sex, cigarette smoking, and body mass index. This analysis indicates that the association between heartburn/regurgitation symptoms and EA is strong, increases with increased duration and/or frequency, and is consistent across major risk factors. Weaker associations for EGJA suggest that this cancer site has a dissimilar pathogenesis or represents a mixed population of patients...|$|R

DesignSystematic literature search in PubMed and EMBASE {{focusing on the}} number of spermatogonia per transverse tubular cross section (S/T) and spermatogonial density per cubic centimeter (cm 3) of testicular volume (S/V) throughout prepuberty. SettingNone. Patient(s) None. Intervention(s) None. Main Outcome Measure(s) Polynomial <b>meta-regression</b> <b>analyses</b> of S/T and S/V of healthy boys from the ages of 0 to 14  years. Result(s) We found six papers describing original quantitative data on S/T and S/V of healthy boys (total n = 334 and 62, respectively) that were suitable for meta-analysis. Polynomial <b>meta-regression</b> <b>analyses</b> of S/T and S/V demonstrated a clear pattern of spermatogonial quantity throughout prepubertal life. This consisted of a decline during the first 3  years of life, a gradual increase until the ages of 6 to 7  years, a plateau until the age of 11  years, and a sharp incline reaching pubertal numbers at 13 to 14  years of age. The association between S/T and S/V allowed us to perform S/T to S/V extrapolation, creating reference S/V (rS/V) values throughout prepubertal life from a cohort of 372 boys. Conclusion(s) Spermatogonial quantity varies during testicular development toward puberty. The values found in this study may serve as a baseline clinical reference to study the impact of diseases and adverse effects of gonadotoxic treatments on spermatogonial quantity in prepubertal testes.

40|$|Background: Systematic {{reviews of}} {{cost-effectiveness}} analyses summarize results and describe study characteristics. Variability {{in the study}} results is often explained qualitatively or based on sensitivity analyses of individual studies. However, variability due to input parameters and study characteristics (e. g., funding or study quality) is often not statistically explained. As a case study, a systematic review on the cost-effectiveness of drug-eluting stents (DES) versus bare-metal stents (BMS) using <b>meta-regression</b> <b>analyses</b> is performed to explore the usefulness of such methods compared with conventional review methods. Methods: We attempted to identify and review all modelling studies published until January 2012 that compared costs and consequences of DES versus BMS. We extracted general study information (e. g., funding), modelling methods, values of input parameters, {{and quality of the}} model using the Philips et al. checklist. Associations between study characteristics and the incremental costs and effectiveness of individual analyses were explored using regression analyses corrected for study ID. Results: Sixteen eligible studies were identified, with a combined total of 508 analyses. The overall quality of the models was moderate (59 % ± 15 %). This study showed associations (e. g., type of lesion) that were expected (based on individual studies), however the <b>meta-regression</b> <b>analyses</b> revealed also unpredicted associations: e. g., model quality was negatively associated with repeat revascularizations avoided.

40|$|Background The {{effects of}} {{antidepressants}} for treating depressive disorders have been overestimated because of selective publication of positive trials. Reanalyses that include unpublished trials have yielded reduced effect sizes. This in turn {{has led to}} claims that antidepressants have clinically insignificant advantages over placebo and that psychotherapy is therefore a better alternative. To test this, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies comparing psychotherapy with pill placebo. Method Ten 10 studies comparing psychotherapies with pill placebo were identified. In total, 1240 patients were included in these studies. For each study, Hedges' g was calculated. Characteristics of the studies were extracted for subgroup and <b>meta-regression</b> <b>analyses.</b> Results The effect of psychotherapy compared to pill placebo at post-test was g= 0. 25 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 14 - 0. 36, I (2) = 0 %, 95 % CI 0 - 58]. This effect size corresponds to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 7. 14 (95 % CI 5. 00 - 12. 82). The psychotherapy conditions scored 2. 66 points lower on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) than the placebo conditions, and 3. 20 points lower on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Some indications for publication bias were found (two missing studies). We found {{no significant differences between}} subgroups of the studies and in <b>meta-regression</b> <b>analyses</b> we found no significant association between baseline severity and effect size. Conclusions Although there are differences between the role of placebo in psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy research, psychotherapy has an effect size that is comparable to that of antidepressant medications.

To quantify the association between statin use and risk for haematological malignancies, we performed a detailed meta-analysis of published studies regarding this subject. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of multiple databases including PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library Central database up to July 2013. Fixed-effect and random-effect models were used to estimate summary relative risks (RR) and the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Potential sources of heterogeneity were detected by <b>meta-regression.</b> Subgroup <b>analyses</b> and sensitivity analysis were also performed. Results: A total of 20 eligible studies (ten case-control studies, four cohort studies, and six RCTs) reporting 1, 139, 584 subjects and 15, 297 haematological malignancies cases were included. Meta-analysis showed that statin use was associated with a statistically significant 19 % reduction in haematological malignancies incidence (RR = 0. 81, 95 % CI [0. 70, 0. 92]).

40|$|Background: Mounting {{evidence}} {{has suggested that}} a-adducin and G-protein b 3 (GNB 3) genes are logical candidates for salt-sensitive hypertension. Some, but not all, studies have reported that a-adducin G 460 T and GNB 3 C 825 T polymorphisms may influence {{the risk of the}} disease. To comprehensively address this issue, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the influence of these two polymorphisms on hypertension and potential biases in Chinese. Methods: Data were analyzed using Stata (v 11. 0) and random-effects model was applied irrespective of between-studies heterogeneity, which was evaluated via subgroup and <b>meta-regression</b> <b>analyses.</b> Study quality was assessed in duplicate. Publication bias was weighed using Egger’s test and funnel plot. Results: 36 study populations totaling 9042 hypertensive patients and 8399 controls were finally identified. Overall, in allelic/genotypic/dominant/recessive models, no significant association was identified for both G 460 T and C 825 T polymorphisms (P. 0. 05) and there was possible heterogeneity (I 2. 25 %). Subgroup analyses by study design indicated that the magnitude of association in population-based studies was marginally significantly strengthened for a-adducin G 460 T allelic model (OR = 1. 12; 95 % CI: 1 : 00 – 1. 25; P = 0. 043). Moreover, subgroup analyses by geographic distribution indicated comparison of 825 T with 825 C yielded a marginally significant increased risk in southern Chinese only (OR = 1. 48; 95 % CI: 1. 01 – 2. 16; P = 0. 045). Further <b>meta-regression</b> <b>analyses</b> showed that geographic regions were a significant source of between-study heterogeneity for both polymorphisms.

Studies examining the relationship between stressful life events and breast cancer risk have produced conflicting results. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to identify studies on this relationship, between 1966 and December 2002, to summarize and quantify the association and to explain the inconsistency in previous results. Summary odds ratios and standard errors were calculated, using random effect <b>meta-regression</b> <b>analyses,</b> for the following categories: stressful life events, death of spouse, death of relative or friend, personal health difficulties, nonpersonal health difficulties, change in marital status, change in financial status and change in environmental status. The presence of publication bias has been explored, and sensitivity analyses were performed to identify heterogeneity, using calculation {{of the percentage of}} variability due to heterogeneity, <b>meta-regression</b> <b>analyses</b> and stratification. Only the categories stressful life events (OR = 1. 77, 95 % CI 1. 31 - 2. 40), death of spouse (OR = 1. 37, 95 % CI 1. 10 - 1. 71) and death of relative or friend (OR = 1. 35, 95 % CI 1. 09 - 1. 68) showed a statistically significant effect. Publication bias was identified in both stressful life events (p = 0. 00) and death of relative or friend (p = 0. 02). Sensitivity analyses resulted in the identification of heterogeneity in all categories, except death of spouse. The results of this meta-analysis do not support an overall association between stressful life events and breast cancer risk. Only a modest association could be identified between death of spouse and breast cancer risk. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: This {{meta-analysis}} {{was conducted}} to compare postoperative outcomes between transverse island flap (TVIF) onlay and tubularized incised-plate (TIP) urethroplasties for primary proximal hypospadias. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature search updated to 21 st May 2014 was carried out for relevant studies. After literature identification and data extraction, odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidential interval (CI) was calculated to compare postoperative complication rate between TVIF onlay and TIP. <b>Meta-regression</b> and subgroup <b>analyses</b> were applied to find potential affective factors. RESULTS: A total of 6 studies including 309 patients receiving TVIF onlay and 262 individuals subjected to TIP met inclusion criteria. The synthetic data suggested that TVIF onlay and TIP were comparable in terms of total complication rate (OR 0. 85, 95 % CI 0. 56 - 1. 30, p = 0. 461), fistula (OR 0. 68, 95 % CI 0. 38 - 1. 21, p = 0. 194), recurrent curvature (OR 1. 16, 95 % CI 0. 43 - 3. 12, p = 0. 766), dehiscence (OR 0. 95, 95 % CI 0. 33 - 2. 74, p = 0. 920), diverticulum (OR 1. 90, 95 % CI 0. 53 - 6. 78, p = 0. 321), meatal stenosis (OR 0. 74, 95 % CI 0. 20 - 2. 77, p = 0. 651) and urethral stricture (OR 1. 49, 95 % CI 0. 41 - 5. 50, p = 0. 545), without significant heterogeneity for each comparison group. <b>Meta-regression</b> and subgroup <b>analyses</b> revealed no significant findings. One-way sensitivity analysis indicated that the results were stable. No publication bias was detected using both funnel plot and Egger's test. Also, there were no obvious differences observed in cosmetic and functional outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that TVIF onlay and TIP urethroplasties are clinically equivalent. Given the inherent limitations of included studies, this conclusion should {{be interpreted with caution}} and wait to be confirmed by more well-designed randomized controlled trials with high quality in the future...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Although Rapid Maxillary Expansion (RME) {{has been}} used for over a century, its effect on upper airways has not yet {{adequately}} been assessed in an evidence-based manner. OBJECTIVE To investigate the volumetric changes in the upper airway spaces following RME in growing subjects by means of acoustic rhinometry, three-dimensional radiography and digital photogrammetry. SEARCH METHODS Literature search of electronic databases and additional manual searches up to February 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomized clinical trials, prospective or retrospective controlled clinical trials and cohort clinical studies of at least eight patients, where the RME appliance was left in place for retention, and a maximum follow-up of 8 months post-expansion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS After duplicate data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias, the mean differences and 95 per cent confidence intervals (CIs) of upper airway volume changes were calculated with random-effects meta-analyses, followed by subgroup <b>analyses,</b> <b>meta-regressions,</b> and sensitivity <b>analyses.</b> RESULTS Twenty studies were eligible for qualitative synthesis, of which 17 (3 controlled clinical studies and 14 cohort studies) were used in quantitative analysis. As far as total airway volume is concerned patients treated with RME showed a significant increase post-expansion (5 studies; increase from baseline: 1218. 3 mm(3); 95 per cent CI: 702. 0 to 1734. 6 mm(3)), which did not seem to considerably diminish after the retention period (11 studies; increase from baseline: 1143. 9 mm(3); 95 per cent CI: 696. 9 to 1590. 9 mm(3)). LIMITATIONS However, the overall quality of evidence was judged as very low, due to methodological limitations of the included studies, absence of untreated control groups, and inconsistency among studies. CONCLUSIONS RME seems to be associated with an increase in the nasal cavity volume in the short and in the long term. However, additional well-conducted prospective controlled clinical studies are needed to confirm the present findings. REGISTRATION None.

40|$|Background: Epidemiologic {{studies have}} {{evaluated}} {{the association between}} cruciferous vegetables(CV) intake {{and the risk of}} renal cell carcinoma(RCC); however, the existing results are controversial. The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the association between CV intake and RCC risk. Methods: A literature search was carried out using PUBMED and EMBASE database between January 1966 and March 2013. Fixed-effect and random-effect models were used to estimate summary relative risks (RR) and the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Potential sources of heterogeneity were detected by <b>meta-regression.</b> Subgroup <b>analyses,</b> sensitivity analysis and cumulative meta-analysis were also performed. Results: A total of 12 studies (six cohorts, six case–control) contributed to the analysis, involving 1, 228, 518 participants and 5, 773 RCC cases. When all studies were pooled, we observed a significantly inverse association between CV intake and RCC risk (RR = 0. 81, 95 % CI [0. 72, 0. 91]). This association was also significant when analyses were restricted to six high-quality studies (RR = 0. 89, 95 % CI [0. 82, 0. 98]). In subgroup analyses, CV intake was significantly associated with reduced RCC risk among studies conducted in America (RR = 0. 77, 95 %CI [0. 70, 0. 86]); however, CV intake had no significant association with RCC risk among studies conducted in Europe (RR = 0. 87, 95 %CI [0. 71, 1. 07]). Furthermore, sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of results...|$|R
