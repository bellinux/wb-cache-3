500|$|Gunn had a [...] "fantastic {{rapport with}} the Norwich supporters". As a player, he liked [...] "to tease the crowd during the game". Before each half of a match, Gunn would run toward his goal and pretend to attempt to headbutt the crossbar. Gunn {{says this is a}} habit he began as a youngster, and cannot {{remember}} how or why he began to do it. Norwich fans noticed it soon after his arrival at the club and, in Gunn's words, [...] "would wait until I got to about the 18-yard line and then start a small [...] "Wooo..." [...] which would build into a full-blown [...] "WOOOO ... AH!" ... I loved it and came close to smacking <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> woodwork a couple of times". [...] During play, he would cup his ear, which would prompt shouts of [...] "Bryan, Bryan, give us a wave".|$|E
500|$|The dark {{music on}} My War lacks the humor and fist-pumping anthems that {{lightened}} up Damagedâ€”no longer the snotty-nosed punk {{approach of the}} Keith Morris era, the band now focused on gloom, depression, defeatism, and aggression. [...] The sides on the original LP divide the tracks into stylistic halves. [...] The first half features five tracks of high-powered hardcore punk and closes with a noisy freak-out, [...] "The Swinging Man". [...] Dukowski penned the opening title track. [...] Ginn's [...] "Can't Decide" [...] follows, a gloomy ode to frustration: [...] "I conceal my feelings/ So I don't have to explain/ What I can't explain anyway". [...] "Beat <b>My</b> <b>Head</b> <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> Wall" [...] rails at conformity and the band's experience with a major label: [...] "Swimming in the mainstream/ Is such a lame, lame dream". [...] Dukowski's [...] "I Love You" [...] parodies pop ballads with lyrics of violence and dysfunction in a relationship gone wrong. [...] Ginn and Rollins share credit on the metallic [...] "Forever Time" [...] and the noisy [...] "Swinging Man".|$|E
500|$|... "I'm Her Slave" [...] is {{a heroin}} anecdote with lyrics narrated by a subjugate lover. Music critic Greg Kot cites [...] "Turn On the Water" [...] {{as an example}} of when [...] "the twisted narrator is the victim" [...] and [...] "cast adrift" [...] in Dulli's lyrics. Inspired by a {{paranoid}} breakup, [...] "Conjure Me" [...] is told from the perspective of an aggressive predator and obscure object of desire. On [...] "Kiss the Floor", the narrator recounts stealing a girl's virginity and avoiding her brothers. [...] "This Is My Confession" [...] has a theme of absolution. The lyrics depicts it as an empty sexual experience: [...] "Shove <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> door, crawl inside and kiss the floor / Waiting for the sun again, drink it, smoke it, stick it in." [...] "The Temple" [...] is a cover of the song of the same name from the 1970 rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar. Dulli became a fan of the rock opera as a child when his babysitter played it. [...] "Let Me Lie to You" [...] has lyrics expressing passive cruelty and subtle manipulation. [...] "Tonight" [...] depicts a peaceful night as the backdrop for the narrator's corrupt one-track mind: [...] "Follow me down to the bushes, dear / No one will know, we'll disappear / I'll hold your hand, we'll never tell / Our private little trip to hell". The album's hidden track [...] "Miles Iz Ded" [...] is about seduction and alcohol, with a last call sensibility and despairing tone.|$|E

"When I think," [...] said Kipps, {{as soon as}} {{the door}} closed again behind Gwendolen, [...] "when I think of the 'ole people and 'aving to tell 'em of it all--I want to smesh <b>my</b> <b>'ead</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> nearest wall. Smesh my silly brains out! And Buggins--Buggins what I'd 'arf promised to start in a lill' {{outfitting}} shop in Rendezvous Street."...|$|R

6000|$|The constable gave {{a slight}} gulp. [...] "I saw the three running {{by the side}} of the road," [...] he said, slowly. [...] "Their {{behaviour}} seemed suspicious, so I collared the big one, but they set on me like wild cats. They had me down three times; the last time I laid <b>my</b> <b>head</b> open <b>against</b> <b>the</b> kerb, and when I came to my senses again they had gone." ...|$|R
2500|$|Prior to Big & Rich's foundation, John Rich was a {{founding}} member of the band Texassee, which later became Lonestar. Rich played bass guitar in the band and alternated with Richie McDonald on lead vocals; he also co-wrote their singles [...] "Come Cryin' to Me" [...] and [...] "Say When". After Lonestar released its second album, Rich departed from the band in 1998. Kenny Alphin (aka Big Kenny) was signed to Hollywood Records in 1998, where he recorded a rock album called Live a Little a year later. [...] Although one of its songs was featured in the soundtrack to the film Gun Shy, Live a Little was not released, and Hollywood Records held the rights to the songs for five years. In the meantime, The Mavericks recorded one of Alphin's songs ("I Hope You Want Me Too") on their 1998 album Trampoline, and Danni Leigh recorded his [...] "Beatin' <b>My</b> <b>Head</b> <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> Wall" [...] on her album 29 Nights. Big Kenny then befriended Rich after meeting him at a club, and the two began writing songs together. Their first songwriting collaboration was [...] "I Pray for You," [...] which they wrote in October 1998.|$|E
60|$|I {{went forward}} and seated {{myself in a}} tar-bucket, with <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> mast, to get what sleep I could.|$|E

60|$|When next {{consciousness}} came, the tarry, salt {{smell of}} a ship was in my nostrils, and I {{knew that we were}} embarked. I lay in a clean bunk in a fair-sized and sun-washed cabin, and I heard the scraping of ropes and the tramp of feet on the deck above <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> Framed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> irregular glass of the cabin window, which was greened by the water beyond, Dorothy and my Lord stood talking in whispers.|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon {{a drop of}} whisky will do me good if {{anything}} will," [...] Ben said. [...] "I was crushed pretty near flat, and if <b>my</b> <b>head</b> hadn't been <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall I should have been smothered. Are you all right, young Tom?" ...|$|R
6000|$|From a {{chaos of}} wild dreams was finally evolved a {{gigantic}} clam, whose mission {{it was to}} devour me as I had devoured its relatives. The sharp shells gaped before me, a solemn voice said, [...] "Take her by her little head and eat her quick." [...] Retribution was at hand, and, with a despairing effort to escape by diving, I bumped <b>my</b> <b>head</b> smartly <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall, and woke up feeling {{as if there was}} an earthquake under the bed.|$|R
6000|$|I {{took another}} turn across the room, full {{of love for}} my pretty wife, and distracted by self-accusatory inclinations to knock <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> door. I sat down again, and said: ...|$|E
60|$|He {{shortened}} {{his sword}} to kill me, but, changing his mind, he seized {{me by the}} throat and banged <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> stones until I was unconscious. So it was that I became the prisoner of the Russians.|$|E
60|$|How long I stood {{listening}} {{in the darkness}} I do not know, but the silence was unbroken, and at last I sunk to the hard floor of my prison, where, leaning <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> stony wall, I slept.|$|E
60|$|We {{were both}} of us capsized in a second, and {{both of us}} rolled, almost together, into the scuppers, the dead red-cap, with his arms still spread out, {{tumbling}} stiffly after us. So near were we, indeed, that <b>my</b> <b>head</b> came <b>against</b> <b>the</b> coxswain's foot with a crack that made my teeth rattle. Blow and all, I was the first afoot again, for Hands had got involved with the dead body. The sudden canting of the ship had made the deck no place for running on; I had to find some new way of escape, and that upon the instant, for my foe was almost touching me. Quick as thought, I sprang into the mizzen shrouds, rattled up hand over hand, and did not draw a breath till I was seated on the cross-trees.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{know who}} has been putting that in your head,' rejoined her son disconsolately; 'that's Little Bethel again. Now I say, mother, pray don't take to going there regularly, for if I was to see your good-humoured face that has always made home cheerful, turned into a grievous one, and the baby trained to look grievous too, and to call itself a young sinner (bless its heart) and {{a child of the}} devil (which is calling its dead father names); if I was to see this, and see little Jacob looking grievous likewise, I should so take it to heart that I'm sure I should go and list for a soldier, and run <b>my</b> <b>head</b> on purpose <b>against</b> <b>the</b> first cannon-ball I saw coming my way.' ...|$|R
60|$|Sleep got {{the better}} of fear {{to such an extent that}} my boots {{appeared}} to gape, and my bonnet nodded on its peg, before I gave in. Having piled my cloak, bag, rubbers, books and umbrella on the lower shelf, I drowsily swarmed onto the upper one, tumbling down a few times, and excoriating the knobby portions of my frame in the act. A very brief nap on the upper roost was enough to set me gasping as if a dozen feather beds and the whole boat were laid over me. Out I turned; and after a series of convulsions, which caused my neighbor to ask if I wanted the stewardess, I managed to get my luggage up and myself down. But even in the lower berth, my rest was not unbroken, for various articles kept dropping off the little shelf at the bottom of the bed, and every time I flew up, thinking my hour had come, I bumped <b>my</b> <b>head</b> severely <b>against</b> <b>the</b> little shelf at the top, evidently put there for that express purpose. At last, after listening to the swash of the waves outside, wondering if the machinery usually creaked in that way, and watching a knot-hole in the side of my berth, sure that death would creep in there as soon as I took my eye from it, I dropped asleep, and dreamed of muffins.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is wind {{enough when}} we once get {{well beyond the}} town; but unless we get a good start they will {{overtake}} us in boats. Is it a state affair, Maitre Perrot? For I own to you I don't like running <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> state." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's a thick carpet {{there to}} fall soft on," [...] said Cashel, pulling Bashville into the room. [...] "Come along. Now, show me that little trick of yours again.

6000|$|... "Say not so, I pray you, Sir Ralph," [...] Edgar said. [...] "In {{skill with}} the French tricks I {{may have had}} the better of you, but with a mace you would have dashed my brains out, as I could not have guarded <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> blows {{that you could have}} struck with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{need to have}} {{recourse}} to such extreme measures, I assure you. Allons, monsieur le professeur--asseyons-nous; je vais vous donner une petite lecon dans votre etat d'instituteur." [...] (I wish I might write all {{she said to me}} in French--it loses sadly by being translated into English.) We had now reached THE garden-chair; the directress sat down, and signed to me to sit by her, but I only rested my knee on the seat, and stood leaning <b>my</b> <b>head</b> and arm <b>against</b> <b>the</b> embowering branch of a huge laburnum, whose golden flowers, blent with the dusky green leaves of a lilac-bush, formed a mixed arch of shade and sunshine over the retreat. Mdlle. Reuter sat silent a moment; some novel movements were evidently working in her mind, and they showed their nature on her astute brow; she was meditating some CHEF D'OEUVRE of policy. Convinced by several months' experience that the affectation of virtues she did not possess was unavailing to ensnare me--aware that I had read her real nature, and would believe nothing of the character she gave out as being hers--she had determined, at last, to try a new key, and see if the lock of my heart would yield to that; a little audacity, a word of truth, a glimpse of the real. [...] "Yes, I will try," [...] was her inward resolve; and then her blue eye glittered upon me--it did not flash--nothing of flame ever kindled in its temperate gleam.|$|R
5000|$|In November 1944, Rudolph put Magnus {{in charge}} of rocket fin servomotors, which were the most {{troublesome}} V-2 component at that time. During this period, concerns over sabotage were at their height. In a notorious incident that winter, several Russian prisoners suspected of sabotage were executed by being hanged from cranes used to lift rocket parts and left dangling for a full work day, as an example to other inmates. In this tense atmosphere, servomotors were {{at the heart of}} two abuse accusations leveled against Wernher von Braun by Mittelwerk prisoners after the war, one that may have actually involved Magnus. Michael Neufeld, a Smithsonian historian and author of a 2007 biography of Wernher, has tried to unravel claims by Dora prisoners that they personally witnessed brutality administered by the more famous von Braun brother. In a 2002 article about Wernher's potential culpability in Nazi slave labor at Mittelwerk and several other locations, Neufeld dismissed most claims that von Braun carried out direct sadistic behavior as spurious, easily disproved by tracking his known locations during the war. However, Neufeld felt that there were two accusations in particular that merited further study, the second of which might have involved Magnus. [...] "Reports that Wernher von Braun attended hangings, ordered hangings, attended hangings in SS uniform, etc., have scarcely been discussed in the literature because such testimonies lack credibility," [...] Neufeld wrote. [...] "But in recent years I have received two reports from French Dora survivors that deserve more consideration." [...] In the first incident, survivor Georges Jouanin, whose job was to climb into upright tail sections of V-2s to install cables to the servomotor, placed a wood shoe on one of the units. He later recorded that [...] "someone has noticed my wooden-heeled clog atop such a fragile organ, and I feel a hand pulling insistently on the end of my striped pants, thus forcing me out of the tail unit. 'You, out of here, man, you're committing sabotage. You shouldn't step with your foot on this.' I get slapped in the face twice and <b>my</b> <b>head</b> bounces <b>against</b> <b>the</b> metal panels of the tail unit. Cap in hand, I find myself in front of a man in his 30s, rather well dressed, angry, to who I am not allowed to give an explanation. The seven or eight engineers or technicians in the group of which he came out seem disconcerted, astonished... I went back to my work space and the incident seemed over, without consequences. My civilian foreman, Manger is his name, returns from break and tells me... 'Our big boss boxed your ears! That was V. Braun.'" ...|$|R

60|$|A mate, or a boatswain, or an admiral, or one {{of those}} sort of people--I could not be sure, in the darkness, which it was--came up to me as I was leaning with <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> paddle-box, and asked me what I thought of the ship. He said she was a new boat, and that this was her first voyage.|$|E
60|$|I placed myself {{sideways}} {{against the}} railing of the verandah--first ascertaining, by touching them, {{the position of the}} flower-pots on either side of me. There was room enough for me to sit between them and no more. The sweet-scented leaves of the flower on my left hand just brushed my cheek as I lightly rested <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> railing.|$|E
60|$|I did so, not {{at first}} aware what was his intention; but when I saw him lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume was flung, it hit me, and I fell, {{striking}} <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> door and cutting it. The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its climax; other feelings succeeded.|$|E
60|$|MACAIRE. Bertrand, I will bet you <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> your own--the longest odds I can imagine--that with honesty for my spring-board, I leap {{through history}} like a paper hoop, {{and come out}} among posterity heroic and immortal.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! I see, capsized," [...] he said, {{rising and}} {{pressing}} {{his hand to}} his brow, [...] "I believe I must have hit <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> a stump, for I've been slightly stunned. However, `all's well that ends well.' Not hurt, Francois?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Production for {{the film}} started in November 1961. As {{with most of the}} Hammer productions, the film was shot at Bray Studios on a modest budget. Lom {{recalled}} in one interview how the producers at Hammer expected actors to throw themselves into their work: [...] "For one of my scenes, the Hammer people wanted me to smash <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> a stone pillar, because they said they couldn't afford one made of rubber," [...] Lom reveals. [...] "I refused to beat <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> stone, of course. This caused a 'big crisis', because it took them half a day to make a rubber pillar that looked like stone. And of course, it cost a few pennies more. Horror indeed!" ...|$|R
6000|$|COKESON. [Doggedly] I {{know this}} young feller, I've watched him for years. He's eurotic--got no stamina. His father died of consumption. I'm {{thinking}} of his future. If he's to be kept there shut up by himself, without a cat to keep him company, it'll do him harm. I said to him: [...] "Where do you feel it?" [...] "I can't tell you, Mr. COKESON," [...] he said, [...] "but sometimes I could beat <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall." [...] It's not nice.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do you understand?--that Unga {{was to go}} {{away with}} him in his ship. The blood of my fathers flamed hot on the sudden, and I made to drive him through with my spear. But the spirit of the bottles had stolen the life from my arm, and he took me by the neck, so, and knocked <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall of the house. And I was made weak like a newborn child, and my legs would no more stand under me.|$|E
60|$|Owing to {{some little}} {{accidental}} movement--I think I dropped my thimble on the floor, and in stooping to regain it, hit {{the crown of}} <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> sharp corner of my desk; which casualties (exasperating to me, by rights, if to anybody) naturally made a slight bustle--M. Paul became irritated, and dismissing his forced equanimity, and casting to the winds that dignity and self-control with which he never cared long to encumber himself, he broke forth into the strain best calculated to give him ease.|$|E
60|$|I shoved <b>my</b> <b>head</b> closer <b>against</b> his chest. There {{was another}} {{silence for a}} long time.|$|R
6000|$|... "That won't kill her," [...] said Sophia, {{who felt}} that she herself would not perish under any such process. [...] "If I was sure that I was in the right, I think that I could hold up <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> all that. But they say that she is crushed to the earth." ...|$|R
60|$|So we {{sat down}} once more <b>against</b> <b>the</b> chests of useless {{diamonds}} in that dreadful inaction {{which was one of}} the hardest circumstances of our fate; and I am bound to say that, for my part, I gave way in despair. Laying <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> Sir Henry's broad shoulder I burst into tears; and I think that I heard Good gulping away on the other side, and swearing hoarsely at himself for doing so.|$|R
