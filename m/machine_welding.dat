5000|$|Because of {{the thermal}} {{stresses}} incurred in flight above Mach 2, the Mikoyan-Gurevich OKB had difficulties choosing what materials {{to use for}} the aircraft. They had to use E-2 heat-resistant Plexiglas for the canopy, and high-strength stainless steel for the wings and fuselage. Using titanium rather than steel would have been ideal, but it was expensive and difficult to work with. The problem of cracks in welded titanium structures with thin walls could not be solved, so the heavier nickel steel was used instead. It cost far less than titanium and allowed for welding, along with heat-resistant seals. [...] The MiG-25 was constructed from 80% nickel-steel alloy, 11% aluminium, and 9% titanium.

This role required him to carry out the design from clean sheet to final drawings in SolidWorks and Inventor, including structural analysis using the finite element method and hand calculations, as well as spindle design, drivetrain sizing, and servo actuator selection. His reputation for simple, robust and cost-effective design was highly regarded. His particular specialty was high stiffness machines for friction stir welding of steel and high temperature alloys. He also made significant contributions to the design of workholding fixtures for aircraft and spacecraft. He was also responsible for hiring and overseeing full-time and contract engineering staff in addition to project management for multiple projects simultaneously, which included obtaining quotes and verifying vendors as well as scheduling engineering, manufacturing and shipping. At this company he designed, built and installed machines that welded two spaceships, two airplanes, and nuclear fuel rods.

40|$|A {{method of}} heat {{treatment}} {{has been developed}} to reverse some of the deleterious effects of friction stir welding of plates of aluminum alloy 7050. This alloy is considered unweldable by arc and high-energy-density beam fusion welding processes. The alloy can be friction stir welded, but as-welded workpieces exhibit low ductility, low tensile and yield strengths, and low resistance to stress corrosion cracking. Heat treatment according to the present method increases tensile and yield strengths, and minimizes or eliminates stress corrosion cracking. It also increases ductility. This method of heat treatment is a superior alternative to a specification-required heat treatment that caused the formation of large columnar grains, which are undesired. Workpieces subjected to the prior heat treatment exhibited elongations < 2 percent, and standard three-point bend specimens shattered. The development of the present heat treatment method was guided partly by the principles that (1) by minimizing grain sizes and relieving deformation stresses, one can minimize or eliminate stress corrosion cracking and (2) the key to maximizing strength and eliminating residual stresses is to perform post-weld solution heating for as long a time as possible while incurring little or no development of large columnar grains in friction stir weld nuggets. It is necessary to perform some of the solution heat treatment (to soften the alloy and improve <b>machine</b> <b>welding</b> parameters) before welding. The following {{is an example of}} thickness- dependent pre- and post-weld heat treatments according to the present method: For plates 0. 270 in. (approx. 6. 86 mm) thick milled from plates 4. 5 in. (114. 3 mm) thick, perform pre-weld solution heating at 890 F (477 C) for 1 hour, then cool in air. After friction stir welding, perform solution heating for 10 minutes, quench, hold at room temperature for 96 hours, then age at 250 F (121 C) for 5 hours followed by 325 F (163 C) for 27 hours...|$|E
40|$|Present design {{trends in}} {{automotive}} manufacture have shifted emphasis to alternative lightweight materials {{in order to}} achieve higher fuel efficiency and to bring down vehicle emission. Although some other joining techniques are more and more being used, spot welding still remains the primary joining method in automobile manufacturing so far. Spot welds for automotive applications should have a sufficiently large diameter, so that nugget pullout mode is the dominant failure mode. Interfacial mode is unacceptable due to its low load carrying and energy absorption capability. Strength tests with different static loading were performed in, to reveal the failure mechanisms for the lap-shear geometry and the cross-tension geometry. Based on the literature survey performed, venture into this work was amply motivated by the fact that a little research work has been conducted to joining of dissimilar materials like non ferrous to ferrous. Most of the research works concentrated on joining of different materials like steel to steel or aluminium alloy to aluminium alloy by resistance spot welding. In this work, an experimental study on the resistance spot weldability of aluminium alloy (Al 6063) and austenitic stainless steel (AISI 304) sheets, which are lap joined by using a pedestal type resistance spot welding <b>machine.</b> <b>Welding</b> was conducted using a 45 -deg truncated cone copper electrode with 10 -mm face diameter. The weld nugget diameter, force estimation under lap shear test and T – peel test were investigated using digital type tensometer attached with capacitive displacement transducer (Mikrotech, Bangalore, Model: METM 2000 ER 1). The results shows that joining of Al 6063 and AISI 304 thin sheets by RSW method are feasible for automotive structural joints where the loads are below 1000 N act on them, it is observed that by increasing the spots per unit length, then the joint with standing strength to oppose failure is also increased linearly incase of interfacial failure mode and non linear for pullout failure mode.  </p...|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 9 - 24 The {{efficiency}} of compressor impellers, {{apart from the}} design, depends on some features linked with their manufacture. These features are the accuracy of geometry, the surface quality obtained, and the blockages which are inevitable with covered impellers and are attributable to the joining method applied, e. g., greater blade thicknesses {{in the case of}} riveting, or narrowed cross sections, due to weld seams, in the case of welding. As a result of the ever increasing importance of efficiency, efforts have been made to further improve the manufacturing process. The advantages and disadvantages of the various forming methods for high-quality impellers, such as milling with a relatively high accuracy, and involving high manufacturing outlay, are discussed. The various casting processes with a variety of possibilities to fulfill the requirements made with regard to the dimensional tolerances, process-dependent blade thicknesses and manual work for achieving certain specified accuracies are described. The {{efficiency of}} impellers with closed passageways, that is, with a cover or shroud disc, is superior to that of impellers with open passageways. This means that when no cast impellers are used, suitable methods must be available for joining the blades and the cover. For maximum accuracy and minimum blockage, the high-vacuum brazing method has become more and more accepted during the past few years. However, the manufacture of impellers applying the brazing method becomes problematic for large diameters. In addition to vacuum brazing, manual and <b>machine</b> <b>welding</b> processes continue to be applied, including slot welding for two-dimensionally curved blades. Diffusion welding and electron-beam welding have not found acceptance since high costs, unfavorable crevices, and sharp edges, along with possible deformations, have a negative influence on the behavior of such impellers during operation. It is true that the sophisticated riveting process of some manufacturers for two-dimensionally curved blades requires great wall thicknesses; but, {{it is also true that}} high-accuracy impellers can be produced by this method. In addition, the vibratory behavior of such impellers is favorable due to system-inherent dampening. Moreover, riveted impellers will tolerate high stresses when the Bauschinger effect is taken into account. The manufacture of highly stressed impellers for turbocompressors is based on the availability of suitable materials and adequate test methods...|$|E
